Patients were grouped in terms of age at the beginning of thiopurine treatment, specifically in those who started thiopurines over 60 years or between 18 and 50 years of age. Thiopurine-related AEs registered in the ENEIDA database were compared.Out of 48 752 patients, 1888 started thiopurines when over 60 years of age and 15 477 under 50 years of age. Median treatment duration was significantly shorter for those who started thiopurines >60 years (13 [IQR 2-55] vs 32 [IQR -82] months; P < .001). Patients starting >60 years had higher rates of all types of myelotoxicity, digestive intolerance and hepatotoxicity. Thiopurines were discontinued due to AEs (excluding malignancies and infections) in more patients starting >60 years (67.2% vs 63.1%; P < .001). Elderly age and female sex were independent risk factors for most AEs.In elderly  patients, thiopurines are associated with an increased risk of non-infectious, non-neoplastic, AEs.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360579>Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling and the gut-liver axis in liver diseases.</a></h2><p>The liver is the central organ involved in lipid metabolism and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is responsible for nutrient absorption and partitioning. Obesity, dyslipidemia and metabolic disorders are of increasing public health concern worldwide, and novel therapeutics that target both the liver and the GI tract (gut-liver axis) are much needed. In addition to aiding fat digestion, bile acids act as important signaling molecules that regulate lipid, glucose and energy metabolism via activating nuclear receptor, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), Takeda G protein receptor  (TGR5) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is synthesized by two sphingosine kinase isoforms and is a potent signaling molecule that plays a critical role in various diseases such as fatty liver, inflammatory bowel disease () and colorectal cancer. In this review, we will focus on recent findings related to the role of S1P-mediated signaling pathways in the gut-liver axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566409>Status of transition care in inflammatory bowel disease in Spain. Different medical perspectives.</a></h2><p>transition is important for a successful follow-up of adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (). The objectives of the study were to establish the situation of transition in Spain and to identify needs, requirements and barriers to transition from pediatric and adult gastroenterologist perspectives.a structured survey for self-completion using the REDCap platform was distributed via the Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SEGHNP) and the Spanish Working Group on Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU). The questionnaire contained closed and ranked questions concerning transition, perceived needs, organizational, clinician and patient related barriers to transition.one hundred and forty surveys were answered, 53% in pediatrics (PG) and 47% from adult gastroenterologists (AG) among 90 hospitals; 66% of them were reference centers. There was a higher response from pediatricians (18.2%) versus adult gastroenterologists (8.3%) (p = 0.03). A structured transition program is adequate in 42.2% centers. A well-structured transition was perceived as very important by 79.% of PG and 63% of AG (p = 0.03). A higher proportion of both groups identified inadequacies in the preparation of adolescents for transfer (43% and 38%, p = ns). The main deficit areas were the lack of knowledge about disease and treatment as well as the lack of self-advocacy and care coordination. Lack of resources, time and critical mass of patients were the highest ranked barriers by both groups. AG and PG (54% and 55%) highlighted suboptimal training in adolescent medicine.in Spain, nearly half of the centers have developed a structured transition program. Lack of training, time and insufficient resources are the main barriers for a successful transition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498502>Nationwide validation study of diagnostic algorithms for inflammatory bowel disease in Korean National Health Insurance Service database.</a></h2><p>We conducted a nationwide validation study of diagnostic algorithms to identify cases of inflammatory bowel disease () within the Korea National Health Insurance System (NHIS) database.Using the NHIS dataset, we developed 44 algorithms combining the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes, codes for Rare and Intractable Diseases (RID) registration and claims data for health care encounters, and pharmaceutical prescriptions for -specific drugs. For each algorithm, we compared the case identification results from electronic medical records data with the gold standard (chart-based diagnosis). A multiple sampling test verified the validation results from the entire study population.A random nationwide sample of 1697 patients (848 potential cases and 849 negative control cases) from 17 hospitals were included for validation. A combination of the ICD-10 code, ≥ 1 claims for health care encounters, and ≥ 1 prescription claims (reference algorithm) achieved excellent performance (sensitivity, 93.1% [95% confidence interval 91-94.7]; specificity, 98.1% [96.9-98.8]; positive predictive value, 97.% [96.1-98.]; negative predictive value, 94.% [92.8-95.8]) with the lowest error rate (4.2% [3.3-.3]). The multiple sampling test confirmed that the reference algorithm achieves the best performance regarding  diagnosis. Algorithms including the RID registration codes exhibited poorer performance compared with that of the reference algorithm, particularly for the diagnosis of patients affiliated with secondary hospitals. The performance of the reference algorithm showed no statistical difference depending on the hospital volume or  type, with P-value < 0.05.We strongly recommend the reference algorithm as a uniform standard operational definition for future studies using the NHIS database.© 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614543>The Sulfate-Reducing Microbial Communities and Meta-Analysis of Their Occurrence during Diseases of Small-Large Intestine Axis.</a></h2><p>Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are often isolated from animals and people with ulcerative colitis and can be involved in the  development in the gut-intestine axis. The background of the research consisted of obtaining mixed cultures of SRB communities from healthy mice and mice with colitis, finding variation in the distribution of their morphology, to determine pH and temperature range tolerance and their possible production of hydrogen sulfide in the small-large intestinal environment. The methods: Microscopic techniques, biochemical, microbiological, and biophysical methods, and statistical processing of the results were used. The results: Variation in the distribution of sulfate-reducing microbial communities were detected. Mixed cultures from mice with ulcerative colitis had 1.39 times higher production of HS in comparison with samples from healthy mice. The species of  genus play an important role in diseases of the small-large intestine axis. Meta-analysis was also used for the observation about an SRB occurrence in healthy and not healthy individuals and the same as their metabolic processes. Conclusions: This finding is important for its possible correlation with inflammation of the intestine, where the present of SRB in high concentration plays a major part.

About 75% of people with CD undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime to induce remission. However, as there is no known cure for the disease, patients usually experience a recurrence even after surgery. Different interventions are routinely used in maintaining postsurgical remission. There is currently no consensus on which treatment is the most effective.To assess the effects and harms of interventions for the maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease and rank the treatments in order of effectiveness.We searched the Cochrane  Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, abstracts from major gastroenterology meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. There was no restriction on language, date, or publication status.We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions used for maintaining surgically induced remission in people with CD who were in postsurgical remission. Participants had to have received maintenance treatment for at least three months. We excluded studies assessing enteral diet, diet manipulation, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplementation.Two review authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by arbitration of a third review author when necessary. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. For the pairwise comparisons carried out in Review Manager , we calculated risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the NMA, we presented hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) and reported ranking probabilities for each intervention. For the NMA, we focused on three main outcomes: clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data were insufficient to assess time to relapse and histologic relapse. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not sufficiently or objectively reported to permit an NMA. We used CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) methods to evaluate our confidence in the findings within networks, and GRADE for entire networks.We included 35 RCTs (3249 participants) in the review. The average age of study participants ranged between 33.6 and 38.8 years. Risk of bias was high in 18 studies, low in four studies, and unclear in 13 studies. Of the 35 included RCTs, 26 studies (2581 participants; 9 interventions) were considered eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The interventions studied included -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA), adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone. This resulted in 30 direct contrasts, which informed 102 mixed-treatment contrasts.The evidence for the clinical relapse network (21 studies; 2245 participants) and endoscopic relapse (12 studies; 1128 participants) were of low certainty while the evidence for withdrawal due to adverse events (15 studies; 1498 participants) was of very low certainty. This assessment was due to high risk of bias in most of the studies, inconsistency, and imprecision across networks. We mainly judged individual contrasts as of low or very low certainty, except -ASA versus placebo, the evidence for which was judged as of moderate certainty.We ranked the treatments based on effectiveness and the certainty of the evidence. For clinical relapse, the five most highly ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, -ASA, and purine analogues. We found some evidence that adalimumab (HR 0.11, 95% Crl 0.02 to 0.33; low-certainty evidence) and -ASA may reduce the probability of clinical relapse compared to placebo (HR 0.69, 95% Crl 0.53 to 0.87; moderate-certainty evidence). However, budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse (HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.27 to 1.34; low-certainty evidence). We are less confident about the effectiveness of infliximab (HR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.74; very low-certainty evidence) and purine analogues (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.55 to 1.00; low-certainty evidence). It was unclear whether the other interventions reduced the probability of a clinical relapse, as the certainty of the evidence was very low.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing endoscopic relapse. Whilst there might be some evidence of prevention of endoscopic relapse with adalimumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.32; low-certainty evidence), no other intervention studied appeared to be effective.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing withdrawal due to adverse events. Withdrawal due to adverse events appeared to be least likely with sulfasalazine (HR 1.96, 95% Crl 0.00 to 8.90; very low-certainty evidence) and most likely with antibiotics (HR 53.92, 95% Crl 0.43 to 259.80; very low-certainty evidence). When considering the network as a whole, two adverse events leading to study withdrawal (i.e. pancreatitis and leukopenia) occurred in more than 1% of participants treated with an intervention. Pancreatitis occurred in 2.8% (11/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.17% (2/1210) of all other groups studied. Leukopenia occurred in 2.% (10/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.08% (1/1210) of all other groups studied.Due to low-certainty evidence in the networks, we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most effective for preventing clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse. Evidence on the safety of the interventions was inconclusive, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia from purine analogues were evident in the studies. Larger trials are needed to further understand the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494649>MEFV Gene-Related Enterocolitis Account for Some Cases Diagnosed as Inflammatory Bowel Disease Unclassified.</a></h2><p>Familial mediterranean fever (FMF), an autoinflammatory disease, is characterized by periodic fever and serositis.

Recently, patients with MEFV gene mutations and chronic gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation mimicking inflammatory bowel disease () have been reported. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients with  unclassified (IBDU) with MEFV gene mutations.MEFV gene analysis was performed on 8 patients with IBDU among 710 patients with  who had been treated at Kyorin University Hospital from April 2016 to December 2018. Clinical manifestations, endoscopic findings, and serological markers were also analyzed.The average of the 8 patients with IBDU (3 men,  women) was 32.7 ± 6.4 years (range 26-76 years). Their symptoms comprised diarrhea (n = 8, 100%), hematochezia (n = 3, 37.%), abdominal pain (n = 3, 37.%), high fever (n = 2, 16.%), and other periodic symptoms (n = 2, 16.%). MEFV gene mutation was confirmed in 4/8 of these patients. Colonoscopy showed various mucosal lesions, rectal sparing, right side dominant colitis, pseudopolyposis, and granular protrusions. Colchicine was administered to  of the 8 patients (4 with and 1 without MEFV mutation) who were resistant to conventional treatment for ulcerative colitis. Clinical and endoscopic improvement was observed in all of  patients treated with colchicine.Some patients diagnosed as having IBDU have enterocolitis related to MEFV gene mutation and respond to colchicine therapy.© 2019 S.

IBDV outbreaks occasionally occur due to the presence of very virulent, reassortment or variant strains. Vaccine immunization has played crucial roles in  control for decades. However, survival pressure of IBDV from the vaccine immunization also increases the reassortments of circulating viruses. In this study, an IBDV strain was isolated from several broiler farms in Henan Province, central part of China, and named IBDV HN strain. Based on the results of RT-PCR, sequencing and phylogenic analyses of VP1 and VP2 genes, the IBDV HN strain is a novel reassortment strain in the Henan region. Segment A of this strain appears to originate from the very virulent IBDV strain, while segment B comes from the other field reassortment strains. This may be the result of natural reassortant of virus circulating in the field. About 60% (6/10) of experimentally infected specific pathogen-free chickens died after 3 to  d post-infection with typical symptom and pathological lesions. The IBDV HN strain was prone to horizontal transmission, which poses a serious threat to the chicken industry.

Patients exposed to a biologic were more likely to be taking a concurrent immunomodulator, but there was no difference in concurrent corticosteroid usage. The particular class of biologic was not independently associated with total overall infectious complications. Vedolizumab was associated with an increased rate of intra-abdominal sepsis on univariate analysis but not on multivariable analysis. Combination immunosuppression was associated with both an increased rate of overall postoperative infectious complications and intra-abdominal sepsis.The study was limited by its retrospective design and single-center data.The overall rate of total infectious complications or intra-abdominal septic complications was not increased based on preoperative exposure to a particular class of biologic. Rates increased with combination immunosuppression of biologic therapy with corticosteroids and previous abdominal resection. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B24.

A previous version of this review was not able to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for IBS and recommended that further high quality RCTs were conducted to explore the clinical and cost effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for IBS. Two types of homeopathic treatment were evaluated in this systematic review: 1. Clinical homeopathy where a specific remedy is prescribed for a specific condition; 2. Individualised homeopathic treatment, where a homeopathic remedy based on a person's individual symptoms is prescribed after a detailed consultation.To assess the effectiveness and safety of homeopathic treatment for IBS.For this update we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Cochrane  Group Specialised Register and trials registers from inception to 31 August 2018.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and case-control studies that compared homeopathic treatment with placebo, other control treatments, or usual care, in adults with IBS were considered for inclusion.Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcome was global improvement in IBS as measured by an IBS symptom severity score. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, abdominal pain, stool frequency, stool consistency, and adverse events. The overall certainty of the evidence supporting the primary and secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risk of bias. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes.Four RCTs (307 participants) were included. Two studies compared clinical homeopathy (homeopathic remedy, asafoetida or asafoetida plus nux vomica) to placebo for IBS with constipation (IBS-C). One study compared individualised homeopathic treatment (consultation plus remedy) to usual care for the treatment of IBS in female patients. One study was a three armed RCT comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to supportive listening or usual care. The risk of bias in three studies (the two studies assessing clinical homeopathy and the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care) was unclear on most criteria and high for selective reporting in one of the clinical homeopathy studies. The three armed study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care and supportive listening was at low risk of bias in four of the domains and high risk of bias in two (performance bias and detection bias).A meta-analysis of the studies assessing clinical homeopathy, (171 participants with IBS-C) was conducted. At short-term follow-up of two weeks, global improvement in symptoms was experienced by 73% (46/63) of asafoetida participants compared to 45% (30/66) of placebo participants (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.18; 2 studies, very low certainty evidence). In the other clinical homeopathy study at two weeks, 68% (13/19) of those in the asafoetida plus nux vomica arm and 52% (12/23) of those in the placebo arm experienced a global improvement in symptoms (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.15; very low certainty evidence). In the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care (N = 20), the mean global improvement score (feeling unwell) at 12 weeks was 1.44 + 4.55 (n = 9) in the individualised homeopathic treatment arm compared to 1.41 + 1.97 (n=11) in the usual care arm (MD 0.03; 95% CI -3.16 to 3.22; very low certainty evidence).In the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care, the mean IBS symptom severity score at 6 months was 210.44 + 112.4 (n = 16) in the individualised homeopathic treatment arm compared to 237.3 + 110.22 (n = 60) in the usual care arm (MD -26.86, 95% CI -88.59 to 34.87; low certainty evidence). The mean quality of life score (EQ-5D) at 6 months in homeopathy participants was 69.07 (SD 17.35) compared to 63.41 (SD 23.31) in usual care participants (MD .66, 95% CI -4.69 to 16.01; low certainty evidence).For In the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to supportive listening, the mean IBS symptom severity score at 6 months was 210.44 + 112.4 (n = 16) in the individualised homeopathic treatment arm compared to 262 + 120.72 (n = 18) in the supportive listening arm (MD -51.56, 95% CI -129.94 to 26.82; very low certainty evidence). The mean quality of life score at 6 months in homeopathy participants was 69.07 (SD 17.35) compared to 63.09 (SD 24.38) in supportive listening participants (MD .98, 95% CI -8.13 to 20.09; very low certainty evidence).None of the included studies reported on abdominal pain, stool frequency, stool consistency, or adverse events.The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of homeopathy for the treatment of IBS can be drawn. Further high quality, adequately powered RCTs are required to assess the efficacy and safety of clinical and individualised homeopathy for IBS compared to placebo or usual care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482559>Scintigraphy with 99mTc-HMPAO labeled leukocytes is still an accurate and convenient tool to rule out suspected inflammatory bowel disease in children.</a></h2><p>Abdominal pain is a common complaint in children and its differential diagnosis includes inflammatory bowel disease ().

Hence, we performed a systematic review collecting researches on SB MRI for non-IBDs. The literatures were then divided into morphologic group and functional group. Information about the MRI techniques, gastrointestinal preparation, and details of cine-MRI protocols was extracted. We found that a 1. T MRI system, prone positioning, and MR enterography were frequently utilized in clinical practice. Gadolinium contrast sequences were routinely implemented, while diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was much less performed. The gastrointestinal preparation varied throughout the studies. No uniform protocols for cine imaging could be established. SB MRI examinations for non-IBDs are far from standardized, especially for functional studies. Recommendations for standard parameters in cine-MRI sequences are difficult to make due to lack of evidentiary support. MRI investigations in non- conditions are needed and the standardization of non- imaging in clinical practice is required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589357>Therapeutic drug monitoring in Inflammatory Bowel Disease reduces unnecessary use of infliximab with substantial associated cost-savings.</a></h2><p>Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of infliximab (IFX) levels in inflammatory bowel disease () patients can help to guide dose adjustments or changes to therapy for selected patients in remission or with secondary loss of response.To determine how IFX TDM is utilised in a real-life clinical setting and to quantify the potential for TDM to reduce the unnecessary use of IFX.Data from all public  IFX level testing performed across Australia was prospectively collected from June 2016 to July 2017 to assess physician-reported for testing indications (induction, in remission or loss of response) and associated results. The hypothetical influence of IFX TDM was based on an optimal therapeutic range of 6-10 mg/L for mucosal healing.Secondary loss of response (reactive TDM) was the most common indication for TDM. These patients have consistently lower median IFX levels: 3.02 mg/L (IQR 1.14 - 6.67 mg/L) vs. .22 mg/L (IQR 2.70 - 8.12 mg/L), p = 0.0001 compared with patients in remission (proactive TDM). TDM helped to identify unnecessary use of IFX in 30.6% of the TDM tests performed in luminal Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients, with an associated drug cost saving of $531.38 per IFX TDM test episode. Unnecessary IFX use was identified in 38.9% (96/247) of reactive IFX TDM tests performed and in 19.3% (35/181) of proactive testing.Use of both reactive and proactive IFX TDM is cost-effective for  management as it informs the clinician where unnecessary use of IFX can be stopped.

We describe the percentage of acute anterior uveitis (AAU) in a diverse group of SpA patients seen at one academic setting and compare demographic and clinical characteristics according to the presence of uveitis. We conducted a retrospective study of patients with SpA and AAU (January 2016-June 2017). Patients were identified using ICD-10 and administrative claim codes, diagnoses were confirmed through chart review. Extracted data included demographics, laboratory, clinical data, treatment and Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) scores based on Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ). Baseline description and comparison between the two groups were performed. We included 190 patients, mostly men (59.%), with a mean age of 45.9 years: 48% with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 26% with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), 22% with undifferentiated SpA, and 4% with SpA associated with inflammatory bowel disease (). Uveitis was identified in 17% of patients, ranging from 25% in AS to 4% in PsA. Time from symptom onset to SpA diagnosis was longer in patients with uveitis (10.9 versus .9 years, p < 0.001). A higher percentage of patients with uveitis were HLA-B27 positive (85% versus 67%, p = 0.02). The prevalence of uveitis in our population was 17%, slightly lower than previously reported in the literature. There was a diagnostic delay of about 7 years, significantly longer in patients with uveitis. New screening strategies in collaboration with ophthalmology may lead to earlier diagnosis and better outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650868>Exploratory studies with NX-13: oral toxicity and pharmacokinetics in rodents of an orally active, gut-restricted first-in-class therapeutic for  that targets NLRX1.</a></h2><p>Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat containing X1 (NLRX1) is an emerging therapeutic target for a spectrum of human diseases. NX-13 is a small molecule therapeutic designed to target and activate NLRX1 to induce immunometabolic changes resulting in lower inflammation and therapeutic responses in inflammatory bowel disease (). This study investigates the safety of NX-13 in a seven-day, repeat-dose general toxicity study in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at oral doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg. Weights, clinical signs, functional observational battery, clinical pathology and histopathology were used for evaluation. Daily oral dosing of NX-13 up to 1000 mg/kg did not result in any changes in weight, abnormal clinical signs or behavior. No significant differences were observed between treated and control rats in hematology or blood biochemistry. Histopathological evaluation of 12 tissues demonstrated no differences between controls and treated rats. There were no changes in weights of brain, heart, kidney, liver or spleen. Pharmacokinetic analysis of a single oral dose of NX-13 at 10 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats provided a maximum plasma concentration of 57 ng/mL at 0. h post-dose. Analysis of colon tissue after oral dosing with 1 and 10 mg/kg indicated high peak concentrations (10 and 100 µg/g, respectively) that scale in a dose-proportional manner. These experiments suggest that NX-13 is safe and well-tolerated in rats given oral doses as high as 1000 mg/kg with a favorable gastrointestinal localized pharmacokinetic profile, confirming NX-13 as a promising therapeutic for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546056>Discordance Between Patient-Reported Outcomes and Mucosal Inflammation in Patients With Mild to Moderate Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h2><p>Little is known about the association between rectal bleeding and increased stool frequency with endoscopic findings in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). We evaluated the associations between rectal bleeding or stool frequency and endoscopic remission in this population.We performed a post-hoc analysis of data from a phase 3 non-inferiority trial of 817 adults with mild to moderate UC who received treatment with mesalazine. We obtained information on rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and Mayo endoscopic subscores (MESs) at weeks 0, 8, and 38. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values with which rectal bleeding and stool frequency identified patients with MESs of 0 and/or 1 were calculated at weeks 8 and 38 of treatment. The associations between change in rectal bleeding and stool frequency and change in MES after treatment were quantified using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.Among patients with a MES of 0, 7/82 patients (9%) had a rectal bleeding score of 1 or more and 40/82 patients (49%) had a stool frequency score of 1 or more at week 8; at week 38, 6/167 patients (4%) had a rectal bleeding score of 1 or more and 63/167 patients (38%) had a stool frequency score of 1 or more. Among patients with MESs of 0 or 1, 50/310 patients (16%) had a rectal bleeding score of 1 or more and 162/310 patients (52%) had had a stool frequency score of 1 or more at week 8; at week 38, 18/363 patients (%) had a rectal bleeding score of 1 or more and 141/363 patients (39%) had a stool frequency score of 1 or more. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients for change in rectal bleeding and stool frequency with change in MES at week 8 were 0.39 (95% CI, 0.32-0.45) and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.27-0.40), respectively. In patients with reduced MESs at week 8, 39/389 patients (10%) had unchanged or worsening rectal bleeding and 81/389 patients (21%) had unchanged or increasing stool frequencies.In a post-hoc analysis of data from a phase 3 trial of adults with mild to moderate UC treated with mesalazine, we found absence of rectal bleeding to identify patients in endoscopic remission. However, many patients in remission still have increased stool frequency, indicating that it may not be a sensitive marker of disease activity in patients with mild to moderate UC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Topical tacrolimus is effective and safe in patients with refractory UP. However, it is not clear how tacrolimus suppositories fit into in the treatment algorithm of UP.We performed a randomized controlled, double-blind study at 8 hospitals in The Netherlands and Belgium from 2014 through 2017. Eighty-five patients with refractory UP (65% women) were randomly assigned to groups given once daily tacrolimus suppositories (2mg, n=43) or beclomethasone (3mg, n=42) for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was clinical response (decrease in Mayo score of 3 or more). Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic response and remission, adverse events and quality of life. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test.Proportions of patients with clinical responses were 63% in the tacrolimus group and 59% in the beclomethasone group (P=.812); proportions of patients in clinical remission were 46% and 38%, respectively (P=.638). Proportions of patients with an endoscopic response were 68% and 60% in the tacrolimus group and in the beclomethasone group (P=.636); proportions in endoscopic remission rates were 30% and 13%, respectively (P=.092) Median increases in the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score were 18.0 in the tacrolimus group and 20. in the beclomethasone group (P=.395). Adverse event rates did not differ significantly between groups.In a 4-week randomized controlled trial, tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories induce comparable clinical and endoscopic responses in patients with UP refractory to -ASA. There were no significant differences in adverse events rates. Tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories are therefore each safe and effective treatment options for -ASA refractory disease.

The present study aimed to identify the rates and predictors of nonadherence to medications in .This cross-sectional study included patients of  (ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]) recruited between November 2016 and March 2017. Adherence was assessed with a questionnaire (interview based) that evaluated patients' sociodemographic and disease profile and rates and predictors of medication adherence.A total of 266 patients (204 UC, 62 CD) were included (mean age: 38. ± 12.7 years, males: 142 [53.4%], mean disease duration: 6.4 ± .2 years). The overall adherence rate was 82.3%, with the lowest for topical therapy (67.3%) and the highest for steroids (95.9%). Predominant reasons for nonadherence were forgetting dose (18.8%), unavailability of medications (13.2%), felt better (11.7%), adverse effects (6.8%), and cost of treatment (6.0%). Patients' education ( < 0.001), occupation ( = 0.097), and socioeconomic status ( = 0.021) had a negative association with adherence. Patients in upper socioeconomic strata with professional education/occupation were the least adherent (47%), whereas patients from lower socioeconomic strata who were illiterate and unemployed had the highest adherence (100%).More than 80% of patients were adherent to their medications; adherence was the lowest for topical therapy. Higher education, occupation, and upper socioeconomic status were negatively associated with adherence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570679>[Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease-relevant strictures by double balloon enteroscopy].</a></h2><p>To evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) and endoscopic stricturotomy with needle knife (NKSt) in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases ()-relevant strictures.   Methods: From July 2015 to September 2018, 14 patients undergoing double balloon-enteroscopy at the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University were enrolled. There was a total of 16 lesions. Endoscopic intervention was performed for 16 times. EBD was done for 11 times, and  stricturotomies were carried out. Regular follow-up and examinations were done to observe whether there was remission or recurrence of clinical symptoms and replacement surgery.  Results: All 14 patients were successfully treated by endoscopy, and the success rate was 100%. Postoperative clinical symptoms were alleviated, and serious complications, such as perforation or hemorrhaging, did not occur. Obstructive symptoms were effectively alleviated at a median follow-up of 26.1 months (.9-35.3 months) and 8.3 months (1.6-17.8 months) for patients with balloon dilatation and stricturotomy, respectively. Two patients presented with symptoms of obstruction. These were given conservative symptomatic treatment without surgical intervention.  Conclusion: Enteroscopic treatments (EBD and NKSt) are safe and effective for intestinal strictures, and can prolong the time before surgical intervention is needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31335630>Tailor-made iliac branched device for preserving the internal iliac artery in patients with common iliac artery aneurysm.</a></h2><p>Endovascular repair with stent-graft is a treatment option for patient with common iliac artery aneurysm (CIAA). However, the preservation of the internal iliac artery (IIA) is a concern. The commercially available iliac branched device () requires a common iliac length of at least  cm, which is usually too long for Asian people. Here, we report our medium-term results of using tailor-made  for patients with short common iliac artery (CIA) with and without abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).A selected iliac limb of the AAA stent-graft was unloaded from the delivery system. A 6-mm fenestration hole was made at the length of the CIA from the proximal end. The edge of the hole was reinforced with the soft and radiopaque tip of a 0.014´´ wire. Then, the iliac limb was reloaded into the introduced sheath as the tailor-made . It was inserted from the selected side of the femoral artery and deployed. The ipsilateral IIA was cannulated through the fenestration hole. Then, a balloon-expandable or self-expandable covered stent with an appropriate size was deployed as the bridging stent-graft.Between March 2013 and March 2017, a total of 10 patients received the tailor-made IBDs. One patient died of systemic thromboembolism 2 days after the operation. The bridging stent-grafts remained patent in all patients, except one occluded at 1 year after operation.A tailor-made  is an easy-to-apply, alternative option for preserving the IIA perfusion in short CIAA patients with and without AAA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31338466>Risk of iron overload with chronic indiscriminate use of intravenous iron products in ESRD and  populations.</a></h2><p>The routine use of recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) over the past three decades has enabled the partial correction of anaemia in most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Since ESA use frequently leads to iron deficiency, almost all ESA-treated haemodialysis patients worldwide receive intravenous iron (IV) to ensure sufficient available iron during ESA therapy. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease () are also often treated with IV iron preparations, as anaemia is common in . Over the past few years, liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the gold standard method for non-invasive diagnosis and follow-up of iron overload diseases. Studies using MRI to quantify liver iron concentration in ESRD have shown a link between high infused iron dose and risk of haemosiderosis in dialysis patients. In September 2017, the Pharmacovigilance Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) considered convergent publications over the last few years on iatrogenic haemosiderosis in dialysis patients and requested that companies holding marketing authorization for iron products should investigate the risk of iron overload, particularly in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis and, by analogy, patients with . We present a narrative review of data supporting the views and decision of the EMA, and then give our expert opinion on this controversial field of anaemia therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600487>HLA-DQA1*05 Carriage Associated With Development of Anti-Drug Antibodies to Infliximab and Adalimumab in Patients With Crohn's Disease.</a></h2><p>Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies are the most widely used biologic drugs for treating immune-mediated diseases, but repeated administration can induce the formation of anti-drug antibodies. The ability to identify patients at increased risk for development of anti-drug antibodies would facilitate selection of therapy and use of preventative strategies.We performed a genome-wide association study to identify variants associated with time to development of anti-drug antibodies in a discovery cohort of 1240 biologic-naïve patients with Crohn's disease starting infliximab or adalimumab therapy. Immunogenicity was defined as an anti-drug antibody titer ≥10 AU/ml in a drug-tolerant ELISA assay. Significant association signals were confirmed in a replication cohort of 178 patients with inflammatory bowel disease.The HLA-DQA1*05 allele, carried by approximately 40% of Europeans, significantly increased the rate of immunogenicity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90; 95% CI, 1.60-2.25; P=.88×10). The highest rates of immunogenicity, 92% at 1 year, were observed in patients treated with infliximab monotherapy who carried HLA-DQA1*05; conversely the lowest rates of immunogenicity, 10% at 1 year, were observed in patients treated with adalimumab combination therapy who did not carry HLA-DQA1*05. We confirmed this finding in the replication cohort (HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.35-2.98; P=6.60×10). This association was consistent for patients treated with adalimumab (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.32-2.70) or infliximab (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.57-2.33), and for patients treated with anti-TNF therapy alone (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.37-2.22) or in combination with an immunomodulator (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.57-2.58).In an observational study, we found a genome-wide significant association between HLA-DQA1*05 and the development of antibodies against anti-TNF agents. A randomized controlled biomarker trial is required to determine whether pretreatment testing for HLA-DQA1*05 improves patient outcomes by helping physicians select anti-TNF and combination therapies.

Acute colitis was induced by the treatment of C57BL/6 mice with 3.% DSS in drinking water for 6 days. Peripheral blood neutrophils and sera were collected from  patients and murine colitis models. Exposed phosphatidylserine (PS) was analyzed with flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Procoagulant activity was evaluated using clotting time, purified coagulation complex and fibrin formation assays.We observed higher plasma NET levels and presence of NETs in colon tissue in patients with active . More importantly, NETs were induced in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-colitis and inhibition of NET release attenuated colitis as well as colitis-associated tumorigenesis. NET degradation through DNase administration decreased cytokine levels during DSS-induced colitis. In addition, DNase treatment also significantly attenuated the accelerated thrombus formation and platelet activation observed in DSS-induced colitis. NETs triggered PS-positive microparticle release and PS exposure on platelets and endothelial cells partially through TLR2 and TLR4, converting them to a procoagulant phenotype.NETs exacerbate colon tissue damage and drive thrombotic tendency during active .

Clinical and demographic factors were recorded at diagnosis. We examined paid service and professional costs related to outpatient medications and infusions, outpatient procedures and radiology imaging, inpatient services, and outpatient visits. Actual dollar reimbursements were from private and public payers. Data is reported as mean ± SD and median (IQR).First-year cost data were collected on 67 patients (43 Crohn's disease [CD], 24 ulcerative colitis [UC], mean age 13 years [SD 3.22]) revealing a mean cost of $45,753 (SD $37,938), with $43,095 (SD $30,828) for CD and $50,516 (SD $48,557) for UC. Severe CD (n = 11) had a mean cost of $71,176 (SD $43,817) and severe UC (n = ) $134,178 (SD $40,920). Patients receiving infusion therapy had a mean cost of $59,376 (SD $38,724) compared with $27,903 (SD $28,795) for those not receiving infusions. Overall cost distribution showed 37% from infusion costs, 25% hospital costs, 18% outpatient procedures, 10% outpatient oral medications, 7% outpatient imaging, and 3% outpatient visits.Infusion therapy is a key driver of first-year costs for children newly diagnosed with .

UC is estimated to afflict hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone. In addition to traditional colonoscopy, ultrasonic techniques can detect colitis, but have limited spatial resolution, which frequently results in underdiagnoses. Nevertheless, clinical diagnosis of colitis is still generally performed via colonoscopy. Optical techniques such as confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been proposed to detect UC with higher resolution. However, UC can potentially alter tissue biomechanical properties, providing additional contrast for earlier and potentially more accurate detection. Although clinically available elastography techniques have been immensely useful, they do not have the resolution for imaging small tissues, such as in small mammalian disease models. However, OCT-based elastography, optical coherence elastography (OCE), is well-suited for imaging the biomechanical properties of small mammal colon tissue.In this work, we induced elastic waves in  mouse colon tissue using a focused air-pulse. The elastic waves were detected using a phase-stabilized swept source OCE system, and the wave velocity was translated into stiffness. Measurements were taken at six positions for each sample to assess regional sample elasticity. Additional contrast between the control and diseased tissue was detected by analyzing the dispersion of the elastic wave and tissue optical properties obtained from the OCT structural image.The results show distinct differences (P<0.05) in the stiffness between control and colitis disease samples, with a Young's modulus of 11.8±8.0 and .1±1. kPa, respectively. The OCT signal standard deviations for control and diseased samples were .8±0.3 and .±0.2 dB, respectively. The slope of the OCT signal spatial frequency decay in the control samples was 92.7±10.0 and 87.3±4.7 dB∙µm in the colitis samples. The slope of the linearly fitted dispersion curve in the control samples was 1. mm, and 0.8 mm in the colitis samples.Our results show that OCE can be utilized to distinguish tissue based on stiffness and optical properties. Our estimates of tissue stiffness suggest that the healthy colon tissue was stiffer than diseased tissue. Furthermore, structural analysis of the tissue indicates a distinct difference in tissue optical properties between the healthy and UC-like diseased tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474792>High prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (). This study evaluated the prevalence of NAFLD and the associated risk factors among  patients who received anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.Adult  patients receiving anti-TNF therapy (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab) were enrolled. Hepatic steatosis was assessed by abdominal ultrasound. Patients with a history of excessive alcohol or recent steroid use were excluded. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed.Eighty patients, 55% male, mean age 42±15 years, were enrolled. The sonographic prevalence of NAFLD was 54% (43/80), significantly higher than the general prevalence in the US adult population (30%) (P<0.0001). NAFLD patients had a significantly higher proportion of males, as well as greater body weight and body mass index, compared to non-NAFLD. The Crohns disease activity index (CDAI) was significantly higher among patients with NAFLD. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a higher CDAI was independently associated with NAFLD, with an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.05-2.44; P=0.03).The presence of  is strongly associated with NAFLD.

We evaluatedthe predictive value of serum albumin and γ-globulin concentrations for treatment failure.Prospectively, all patients treated for the first time with either infliximab or adalimumab for  between 2007 and 2018 were included. All patients were tested for serum albumin and γ-globulin concentrations and were followed up until June 2018.128 patients (95 Crohn's disease, 67 females, age 40.1 ± 13.7 years) were included in the study. 81patients (63.3%) received infliximab and 47 (36.7%) adalimumab first line. Eight patients (6.3%) were primary non-responders, 50 patients (39.0%) showed a sustained clinical remission and 70 patients (54.7%) developed a secondary loss of response. Meantime to develop secondary loss of response was 24. ± 20. months. Albumin serum concentrations in the clinical response group were significantly higher than in the secondary loss of response group (39.8 ± .7 g/L vs. 35.0 ± .4 g/L). γ-globulin serum concentrations in the sustained response group were significantly lower than in the secondary loss of response group (11.8 ± 2.8 g/L vs. 14.7 ± 4. g/L). Hypoalbuminemia and hypergammaglobulinemia were associated with the loss of response. Immunosuppressant co-medication in patients with high γ-globulin serum concentrations reduced the risk of secondary loss of response.Low albumin and increased γ-globulin serum concentrations are strongly associated with a higher risk for loss of response to an anti-TNFα treatment. Increased serum γ-globulin concentrations may have a higher risk to produce anti-drug antibodies or a different phenotype of disease less responsive to anti-TNFα treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560042>Utilization of Diagnostic Imaging and Ionization Radiation Exposure Among an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Inception Cohort.</a></h2><p>Abdominal imaging is important in managing inflammatory bowel disease (). We characterized utilization of imaging and exposure to ionizing radiation.We enumerated abdominal diagnostic imaging in a population-based cohort of  patients between 1994 and 2016. Trends in utilization of abdominal computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound were characterized. Cumulative doses of ionizing radiation were compared between  patients and non- controls and between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Regression models were constructed to assess predictors of high ionizing radiation exposure.There were 72,933 incident cases of . During the first  years of diagnosis,  patients were exposed to nearly 6-fold higher exposure to cumulative ionizing radiation attributable to abdominal imaging compared with non- controls (18.6 mSv vs 2.9 mSv). Cumulative ionizing radiation exposure was higher in CD than UC (26.0 mSv vs 12.0 mSv; P < 0.001). Crohn's disease patients were more than twice as likely as UC patients to exceed 50 mSv (15.6% vs 6.2%; P < 0.001) and 100 mSV (.0% vs 2.1%; P < 0.001). There was geographic variation in ionizing radiation exposure, and individuals of lower income were more likely to have high exposure. Utilization of abdominal MRI has increased substantially, peaking between 2007 and 2012 and increasing annually at 34%, which coincided with an annual 2% decline in the use of abdominal CT.Crohn's disease patients are at highest risk for high exposure to ionizing radiation, with a subgroup receiving potentially harmful levels. Increasing utilization and access to abdominal MRI may alleviate exposure.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

A potential association between high 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) or 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) levels and leukopenia was observed, since most studies reported higher metabolite levels in leukopenic patients (6-TGN: 204-308 (Lennard method) and 397 (Dervieux method), 6-MMP: 4020-10 450 pmol/8 x 10 RBC) compared to controls (6-TGN: 170-212 (Lennard method) and 269 (Dervieux method), 6-MMP: 1025-4550 pmol/8 x 10 RBC).TPMT and NUDT15 variants predict thiopurine-induced leukopenia. High 6-TGN and 6-MMP levels might induce leukopenia, although exact cut-off values remain unclear. Potential preventive measures to reduce the risk of thiopurine-induced leukopenia include pre-treatment TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping. Routine thiopurine metabolite measurement might be efficient, yet cut-off levels must be validated in advance.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420894>Increased risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in inflammatory bowel disease: A nationwide study.</a></h2><p>The relationship between inflammatory bowel disease () and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains unclear. We evaluated the risk for developing IPF in patients with  using a nationwide population-based study.Using claims data from the National Health Insurance service in Korea, patients with , including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), were identified through both the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and rare and intractable disease program codes from January 2010 to December 2013. We compared 38 921  patients with age-matched and sex-matched individuals without  in a ratio of 1:3. Patients with newly diagnosed IPF were identified by both the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and rare and intractable disease registration codes.During a mean 4.9-year follow-up, the incidence of IPF in patients with  was 33.21 per 100 000 person-years. The overall risk of IPF was significantly higher in  patients than in non- controls (hazard ratio [HR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.20; P = 0.003). In patients with CD, the incidence (per 100 000 person-years) of IPF was 26.04; in controls, the incidence was 9.15 (HR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.46-.72; P = 0.002). The incidence of IPF in patients with UC tended to be higher than in controls (36.66 vs 26.54 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI, 0.99-1.99; HR, 1.41; P = 0.066).

The conjunction of Vit-D as well as zinc levels and anti-TNF-α-trough concentrations (TC) has not yet been explored.To determine the association of serum Vit-D, zinc and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with clinical and biochemical remission and a possible correlation with serum TC and antibody levels of anti-TNF-α.Serum Vit-D and zinc levels as well as Infliximab (IFX) and Adalimumab (ADA) TC during the maintenance phase of treatment were measured in 112  patients. Statistical analysis were performed for clinical and biochemical remission.Vit-D and zinc deficiency were detected in 58 and 4.% of the patients respectively. In IFX-treated patients, IFX-TC, Vit-D and CRP levels were associated independently with clinical remission with an OR of 20 (95% CI 1.3-333, p = 0.03), 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.7, p = 0.02) and 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.8, p = 0.01) respectively. Serum IFX-TC and Vit-D levels correlated positively (r = 0.39, p = 0.001), while serum IFX-TC and CRP levels showed an inverse correlation (r = -0.43, p < 0.001). Only -IFX-TC associated independently with biochemical remission with a threshold of 3.1 µg/mL. In ADA-treated patients, ADA-TC associated independently with clinical and biochemical remission with an OR of 2. (95% CI 1.1-.0, p = 0.04) and 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.4, p = 0.03) respectively. The serum zinc level was associated neither with clinical nor with biochemical remission in either cohort.Our results indicate that serum Vit-D level may be a predictive marker in addition to drug trough levels in  patients treated with IFX. Furthermore, due to the correlation between serum IFX and Vit-D levels, Vit-D substitution should be conducted in patients with low Vit-D levels.© 2019 S.

The repair function of TLR4 in the intestinal epithelium is still unknown. Here, wild-type (WT) mice, TLR4-knockout mice (KO; TLR4) and commensal-depleted mice were used as dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced or radiation-induced colitis and injury models to explore the role of TLR4 signaling in intestinal injury. Exogenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) promoted DSS-induced inflammatory cytokines and aggravated intestinal damage. TLR4 deficiency and commensal bacterial depletion inhibited the toxic effects of LPS, but these mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced and radiation-induced intestinal damage. Compared with WT mice, neither DSS nor radiation promoted production of more inflammatory cytokines in the guts of TLR4-KO and commensal-depleted mice. Introducing the cytokine repair factors, PGE2 and GM-CSF, increased the cytokine levels in the guts of DSS-induced colitis mice. We hypothesized that TLR4 and its ligands repaired the epithelium after DSS-induced and radiation-induced intestinal damage by upregulating PGE and GM-CSF. Transwell migration assays suggested that LPS, IL6, TNF, PGE and GM-CSF promoted intestinal cell migration, and cell viability analysis suggested that these factors protected against radiation-induced intestinal damage. Our data underscore the importance of the balancing role of TLR4 in intestinal injury and repair.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal anal pouch anastomosis (IPAA) may increase infertility, but the degree to which IPAA affects infertility remains unclear, and the impact of other surgical interventions on infertility is unknown.Primary objective• To determine the effects of surgical interventions for  on female infertility.Secondary objectives• To evaluate the impact of surgical interventions on the need for assisted reproductive technology (ART), time to pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity, mode of delivery (spontaneous vaginal, instrumental vaginal, or Caesarean section), infant requirement for resuscitation and neonatal intensive care, low and very low birth weight, small for gestational age, antenatal and postpartum hemorrhage, retained placenta, postpartum depression, gestational diabetes, and gestational hypertension/preeclampsia.We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane  Group Specialized Register from inception to September 27, 2018, to identify relevant studies. We also searched references of relevant articles, conference abstracts, grey literature, and trials registers.We included observational studies that compared women of reproductive age (≥ 12 years of age) who underwent surgery to women with  who had a different type of surgery or no surgery (i.e. treated medically). We also included studies comparing women before and after surgery. Any type of -related surgery was permitted. Infertility was defined as an inability to become pregnant following 12 months of unprotected intercourse. Infertility at 6, 18, and 24 months was included as a secondary outcome. We excluded studies that included women without  and those comparing women with  to women without ..Two review authors independently screened studies and extracted data. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess bias and GRADE to assess the overall certainty of evidence. We calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using random-effects models. When individual studies reported odds ratios (ORs) and did not provide raw numbers, we pooled ORs instead.We identified 16 observational studies for inclusion. Ten studies were included in meta-analyses, of which nine compared women with and without a previous -related surgery and the other compared women with open and laparoscopic IPAA. Of the ten studies included in meta-analyses, four evaluated infertility, one evaluated ART, and seven reported on pregnancy-related outcomes. Seven studies in which women were compared before and after colectomy and/or IPAA were summarized qualitatively, of which five included a comparison of infertility, three included the use of ART, and three included other pregnancy-related outcomes. One study included a comparison of women with and without IPAA, as well as before and after IPAA, and was therefore included in both the meta-analysis and the qualitative summary. All studies were at high risk of bias for at least two domains.We are very uncertain of the effect of  surgery on infertility at 12 months (RR .45, 95% CI 0.41 to 72.57; 114 participants; 2 studies) and at 24 months (RR 3.59, 95% CI 1.32 to 9.73; 190 participants; 1 study). Infertility was lower in women who received laparoscopic surgery compared to open restorative proctocolectomy at 12 months (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.27; 37 participants; 1 study).We are very uncertain of the effect of  surgery on pregnancy-related outcomes, including miscarriage (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.60; 776 pregnancies;  studies), use of ART (RR 25.09, 95% CI 1.56 to 403.76; 106 participants; 1 study), delivery via Caesarean section (RR 2.23, 95% CI 1.00 to 4.95; 20 pregnancies; 1 study), stillbirth (RR 1.96, 95% CI 0.42 to 9.18; 246 pregnancies; 3 studies), preterm birth (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.67 to .48; 194 pregnancies; 3 studies), low birth weight (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.08 to 4.83), and small for gestational age (RR 2.54, 95% CI 0.80 to 8.01; 65 pregnancies; 1 study).Studies comparing infertility before and after -related surgery reported numerically higher rates of infertility at six months (before: 1/, 20.0%; after: 9/15, 60.0%; 1 study), at 12 months (before: 68/327, 20.8%; after: 239/377, 63.4%;  studies), and at 24 months (before: 14/89, 15.7%; after: 115/164, 70.1%; 2 studies); use of ART (before: .3% to 42.2%; after: 30.3% to 34.3%; proportions varied across studies due to differences in which women were identified as at risk of using ART); and delivery via Caesarean section (before: 8/73, 11.0%; after: 36/75, 48.0%; 2 studies). In addition, women had a longer time to conception after surgery (two to five months; 2 studies) than before surgery ( to 16 months; 2 studies). The proportions of women experiencing miscarriage (before: 19/123, 15.4%; after: 21/134, 15.7%; 3 studies) and stillbirth (before: 2/38, .3%; after: 3/80: 3.8%; 2 studies) were similar before and after surgery. Fewer women experienced gestational diabetes after surgery (before: 3/37, 8.1%; after: 0/37; 1 study), and the risk of preeclampsia was similar before and after surgery (before: 2/37, .4%; after: 0/37; 1 study). We are very uncertain of the effects of -related surgery on these outcomes due to poor quality evidence, including confounding bias due to increased age of women after surgery.We rated evidence for all outcomes and comparisons as very low quality due to the observational nature of the data, inclusion of small studies with imprecise estimates, and high risk of bias among included studies.The effect of surgical therapy for  on female infertility is uncertain. It is also uncertain if there are any differences in infertility among those undergoing open versus laparoscopic procedures. Previous surgery was associated with higher risk of miscarriage, use of ART, Caesarean section delivery, and giving birth to a low birth weight infant, but was not associated with risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, or delivery of a small for gestational age infant. These findings are based on very low-quality evidence. As a result, definitive conclusions cannot be made, and future well-designed studies are needed to fully understand the impact of surgery on infertility and pregnancy outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474787>Clinical utility of fecal calprotectin: potential applications beyond inflammatory bowel disease for the primary care physician.</a></h2><p>Fecal calprotectin (FC) is an inflammatory marker released mainly from gastrointestinal granulocytes measured in stool samples.

The aim of the study was to examine possible differences in allergen sensitization between these diseases and relative to normal blood donors (BD).  Plasma from 29 UC and 37 CD patients with moderate disease activity and 100 healthy age- and gender-matched BD, were analyzed for specific IgE to 22 food- and 28 inhalation allergens using EUROLINE atopy screen.  There was significantly higher proportion of allergen sensitized patients in UC compared to BD. Corresponding mean percentages for UC, CD and BD were 8., 8.9 ( = .2) and .9 ( = .04). There was no intergroup difference in sensitization to food allergens. Most prominent result was the double level of sensitization to inhalants in CD (15%) compared to BD (8%) ( = .03). Overall highest levels of sensitization to inhalants were for grass pollens. Interestingly, the number of allergens ( = 50) the subjects were sensitized to, was significantly lower among UC ( = 20; 40%) ( = .0005) than CD ( = 31; 62%) and BD ( = 38; 76%).  The percentage of individuals sensitized to inhalants in CD and to inhalants and foods in UC, were higher than corresponding results in BD. However, whereas allergen positive reactions in CD were comparable to those in BD, they were reduced in UC because of the few UC reactions to food allergens.

Information about disease control, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources is relevant to optimizing  management.To describe QoL and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources among  patients in Brazil.A multicenter cross-sectional study included adult outpatients who were previously diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). At enrolment, active CD and UC were defined as having a Harvey Bradshaw Index ≥ 8 or a CD Activity Index ≥ 220 or calprotectin > 200 µg/g or previous colonoscopy results suggestive of inadequate control (per investigator criteria) and a 9-point partial Mayo score ≥ , respectively. The PRO assessment included the QoL questionnaires SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), and the WPAI questionnaire. Information about healthcare resources and treatment during the previous 3 years was collected from medical records. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student's -/Mann-Whitney  tests were used to compare PROs, treatment patterns and the use of healthcare resources by disease activity (α = 0.05).Of the 407 patients in this study (CD/UC: 64.9%/35.1%, mean age 42.9/45.9 years, 54.2%/56.6% female, 38.3%/37.1% employed), 44.7%/25.2% presented moderate-to-severe CD/UC activity, respectively, at baseline. Expressed in median values for CD/UC, respectively, the SF-36 physical component was 46.6/44.7 and the mental component was 45.2/44.2, the EQ-visual analog scale score was 80.0/70.0, and the IBDQ overall score was 164.0/165.0. Moderate to severe activity, female gender, being unemployed, a lower educational level and lower income were associated with lower QoL ( < 0.05). Median work productivity impairment was 20% and % for CD and UC patients, respectively, and activity impairment was 30%, the latter being higher among patients with moderate to severe disease activity compared to patients with mild or no disease activity (75.0%  10.0%,  < 0.001). For CD/UC patients, respectively, 25.4%/2.8% had at least one surgery, 38.3%/19.6% were hospitalized, and 70.7%/77.6% changed  treatment at least once during the last 3 years. The most common treatments at baseline were biologics (75.3%) and immunosuppressants (70.9%) for CD patients and -ASA compounds (77.%) for UC patients.Moderate to severe  activity, especially among CD patients, is associated with a substantial impact on QoL, work productivity impairment and an increased number of  surgeries and hospitalizations in Brazil.©The Author(s) 2019.

Leukocyte migration inhibitors are considered as promising and potentially effective therapeutic agents to treat inflammatory and auto-immune disorders. In this study, based on previous trioxotetrahydropyrimidin based integrin inhibitors that suboptimally blocked leukocyte adhesion, twelve molecules with a modified scaffold were designed, synthesized, and tested in vitro for their capacity to block the transendothelial migration of immune cells. One of the molecules, namely, methyl 4-((2-(tert-butyl)-6-((2,4,6-trioxotetrahydropyrimidin-(2H)-ylidene) methyl) phenoxy) methyl) benzoate, (compound 12), completely blocked leukocyte transendothelial migration, without any toxic effects on immune or endothelial cells (IC = 2.4 µM). In vivo, compound 12 exhibited significant therapeutic effects in inflammatory bowel disease ()/Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, fatty liver disease, and rheumatoid arthritis models. A detailed acute and chronic toxicity profile of the lead compound in vivo did not reveal any toxic effects. Such a type of molecule might therefore provide a unique starting point for designing a novel class of leukocyte transmigration blocking agents with broad therapeutic applications in inflammatory and auto-immune pathologies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Experimental colitis was induced by % DSS treatment; mice were injected intraperitoneally with PAP-1 from the first day for 7 consecutive days; then all mice were sacrificed, followed by isolation of colon tissue, peritoneal macrophages and spleen macrophages. The anti-inflammatory effects of PAP-1 and the expression levels of Kv1.3, iNOS, pro-IL-1β, IL-1β and NLRP3 inflammasome were measured.PAP-1 reduced DSS-induced colonic pathological damage, DAI score, MPO activity and levels of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-18. Compared with the DSS model group, the expression of Kv1.3, iNOS, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1p20, pro-IL-1β and IL-1β in colon were decreased in the DSS-induced colitis mice with PAP-1 injection. PAP-1 also reduced the expression of Kv1.3, iNOS, NLRP3, caspase-1p20 and IL-1β on macrophages in colitis mice.PAP-1 had protective effects on DSS-induced colitis, which might be ascribed to the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Therefore, we found that PAP-1 was useful as a therapeutic agent in  and suggested a potential important role of PAP-1 in NLRP3 inflammasome-associated diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, treatment often follows a step-up model whereby the patients start with anti-inflammatory agents (corticosteroids or immunosuppressants) and step-up to monoclonal anti-tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) antibodies and then other biologics if the initial drugs cannot control disease. Unfortunately, many patients do not respond to the costly biologics, and thus often still require gut-resective surgery, which decreases quality of life. In order to decrease rates of surgery and ineffective treatments, it is important to identify markers that accurately predict disease progression and treatment responses, to inform decisions about the best choice of therapeutics.

Our objective was to explore the frequency and severity of neutropenia and it's complications in relation to genotype of GSD-Ib patients.We estimated cumulative incidence of neutropenia and severe neutropenia, relation of genotype to absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and dynamics of ANC during serious bacterial infections (SBI) in a cohort of Serbian GSD Ib patients. Impact of genotype on GSD Ib-related inflammatory bowel disease () was also assessed.Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500/mm was present in all 33 patients, with severe neutropenia (ANC<500/mm) occurring in 60.6% of patients. The median age at neutropenia onset was 24 months, while severe neutropenia developed at median of 4. years. The ANC was elevated during 90.% episodes of SBI. Genotypes c.81T>A/c.785G>A and c.81T>A/c.1042_1043delCT are associated with earlier onset of neutropenia. Patients carrying c.785G>A mutation express a higher capacity for ANC increase during SBI. Inflammatory bowel disease was diagnosed in 8 patients (24.2% of total) with median age of onset at 7 years. Risk for  occurrence was not significantly affected by gender, genotype and severity of neutropenia.We may conclude that certain mutations in SLC37A4 influence the risk for severe neutropenia occurrence but also affect the capacity to increase ANC during SBI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Its insufficiency has negative impact also on inflammatory bowel disease () where it is often present. The recommended daily intake for general population is 600 UI/day (units/day). What is the necessary dose for  patients remains unknown. The aim of the study was to verify whether the 2,000 IU/day of vitD is sufficient for maintaining sustained levels in these patients.Patients with Crohns disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) were supplemented orally with 2,000 IU of cholecalciferol daily during winter time. The level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was established at the beginning of substitution period (October to December) and in Month 4. Demographic data, Ca, P, parathormone levels, dose of vitD used, and patients compliance were observed.108 patients with CD and UC (71/37) were analysed, out of them 51 females, average age 43.3 ± 16.2 years. The level of 25OHD increased from 60.2 ± 26. nmol/l to 68.1 ± 27.1 nmol/l (p &lt; 0.001) during the period with the average substitution dose of vitD 1&#8239;858 ± 464 IU/day. 60.2 % of subjects complied with the recommended dosing of vitD. The dose of 1,820 IU vitD/day showed to be sufficient for maintaining sustained levels in the model. No changes of Ca, P serum levels occurred during observation period.Substitution doses of vitD recommended for general population are insufficient for  patients. A dose of up to 2,000/day, which is safe, is necessary to maintain normal levels of 25OHD.

Although the course of PSC is variable, it frequently is progressive, leading to cirrhosis and requiring a liver transplantation (LT) in more than half of the patients. PSC is the fifth most common indication for LT in the United States and one of the leading indications in Scandinavian countries, whereas PSC affects fewer than % of patients undergoing LT in Turkey. In this study, we analyzed our results in the patients with LT owing to PSC.Between March 2013 and August 2017, all adult patients (>18 years) with LT owing to PSC were analyzed, and clinical data were obtained via retrospective review of patient charts. Demographic features, presence of any concomitant inflammatory bowel disease (), time to LT, and outcome data were recorded.There were 15 patients (8 men and 7 women) with a mean age of 46 ± 13 (age at diagnosis = 36 y). Median time to transplantation was 3 years (range: .-14 yrs.). All patients had a pretransplant history of . Concomitant cholangiocarcinoma was diagnosed in 1 patient (6.%). Postoperative complications were observed in 4 patients (26%), and in 2 patients (13%) PSC recurred at a mean of 52 months postorthotopic LT. Disease-free survival and overall survival were 37.3 and 38 ± 21 months, respectively. One of the patients with recurrence and 1 with graft failure owing to rejection died in the follow-up period.In one single-center study of adults with PSC, we found that all patients with PSC had  at diagnosis. The recurrence rate (13%) was comparable to the literature (20% [.7-59%]). Despite the low frequency of PSC in our clinic, LT in these patients resulted in favorable outcomes regarding postoperative morbidity and mortality compared with other etiologies.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The aim of the study was to assess a possible correlation between genetic variability of the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and the development of toxicity to azathioprine.   A retrospective, single center, blind, case-control study was conducted on 200  patients, of whom 60 cases suspended azathioprine due to toxicity (leukopenia, pancreatitis, hepatitis, and nausea or vomiting), and 140 controls continued treatment with the drug without adverse events.  In the entire cohort, only 8 cases of heterozygous mutations of TPMT were observed, corresponding to 4% mutated haplotype rate, much lower than that reported in literature (close to 10%). No homozygous mutation was found. Regarding the TPMT allelic variants, we did not find any statistically significant difference between patients who tolerated azathioprine and those who suffered from adverse events. (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.08-7.72;  = 0.82).  According to our study, in  patients, the search for TPMT gene mutations before starting treatment with azathioprine is not helpful in predicting the occurrence of adverse events. Importantly, patients with allelic variants should not be denied the therapeutic option of azathioprine, as they may tolerate this drug.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362418>Remission Effects of Dietary Soybean Isoflavones on DSS-Induced Murine Colitis and an LPS-Activated Macrophage Cell Line.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are chronic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, although the exact causes of  remain unknown. Present treatments for IBDs have poor tolerability and insufficient therapeutic efficacy, thus, alternative therapeutic approaches are required. Soybean-derived isoflavones have multiple bioactivities such as anti-inflammation. However, the low water solubility of soybean isoflavones limits their bioavailability and practical use. Therefore, in order to study the preventive effects of water-soluble soybean isoflavones on colonic inflammatory status, we examined soybean-derived isoflavone glycosides (SIFs) in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced murine colitis model and in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW264.7 macrophages. Oral administration of SIF (0. w/v%) attenuated DSS-induced colitis in terms of body weight decrease, colon shortening, epithelial apoptosis, histological score, mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines, and immune cell infiltration in colon tissues. In the in vitro assessment, we observed the inhibitory effects of SIF on the production of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2, via suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages in response to LPS. Furthermore, we confirmed that the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were decreased by pre-treatment with SIF in LPS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages. Moreover, we demonstrated that SIF suppressed inflammatory mediators involved in nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway via inhibitory κB kinase phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory κB. Our results suggested that SIF may be beneficial for the remission of colonic inflammatory status including IBDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524776>Surgery for ulcerative colitis in geriatric patients is safe with similar risk to younger patients.</a></h2><p>A prior study indicated that postoperative mortality and complications were higher in geriatrics with inflammatory bowel disease (). We sought to assess the rates of surgical complications and mortality in patients aged ≥65 years after colectomy for ulcerative colitis (UC).This is a single center retrospective study at a tertiary care center. We reviewed all hospital discharges with ICD-9 code 556.X between January 2002 and January 2014. Patients were included if they underwent a colectomy for UC. All records were manually reviewed for demographics, complications and mortality within 90 days postoperatively.A total of 259 patients underwent surgery for UC during the study period and 34 patients were ≥65 years old (range 65-82) at the time of their surgery. There was no difference in overall length of stay (10. days vs. 9.6 days; P = 0.645) or complication rates (44% vs. 47%; P = 0.854) in the ≥65 cohort compared with the under 65 cohort. Mortality was higher in the geriatric cohort but this included only two deaths within 90 days, one of which was unrelated to the surgery, compared with one death related to surgery within 90 days in the younger cohort. Readmissions occurred in 24% of both cohorts within 90 days.Geriatric patients undergoing surgery for UC are not at increased risk of surgery-related morbidity or mortality compared with a younger cohort.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503493>Enhanced Oral Bioavailability of 2-(Phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic Acid (2-PMPA) from its (-Methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxol-4-yl)methyl (ODOL)-Based Prodrugs.</a></h2><p>2-(Phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid (2-PMPA) is a potent (IC = 300 pM) and selective inhibitor of glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) with efficacy in multiple neurological and psychiatric disease preclinical models and more recently in models of inflammatory bowel disease () and cancer. 2-PMPA (), however, has not been clinically developed due to its poor oral bioavailability (<1%) imparted by its four acidic functionalities ( Log  = -1.14). In an attempt to improve the oral bioavailability of 2-PMPA, we explored a prodrug approach using (-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxol-4-yl)methyl (ODOL), an FDA-approved promoiety, and systematically masked two (), three (), or all four () of its acidic groups. The prodrugs were evaluated for in vitro stability and in vivo pharmacokinetics in mice and dog.

We calculated mean difference (MD) in vedolizumab trough concentration in patients achieving vs not achieving clinical outcomes, and qualitatively synthesized thresholds associated with favourable outcomes.In patients with UC, median vedolizumab trough concentrations were consistently higher in patients achieving clinical remission (median, 14.3 μg/mL vs 10. μg/mL; MD, .1 μg/mL, 95% CI, 2.8-7.4) or endoscopic remission (median, 13.0 μg/mL vs 9.7; MD, .1 μg/mL, 95% CI, 2.2-7.9). In patients with CD, there was no significant difference in median vedolizumab trough concentrations in patients achieving vs not achieving clinical remission (MD, 2.0 μg/mL; 95% CI, -0. to 4.) or endoscopic remission (MD, 3.6 μg/mL; 95% CI, -1.4 to 8.6). In patients with UC, week 6 vedolizumab trough concentrations ≥18.-20.8 μg/mL, and maintenance trough concentrations ≥9.0-12.6 μg/mL were associated with favourable clinical outcomes. Antibodies to vedolizumab were reported in 1.7%-3.0% patients on maintenance therapy.Based on meta-analysis, patients with UC who achieve endoscopic and clinical remission have significantly higher vedolizumab trough concentration during maintenance therapy. Vedolizumab trough concentration >20 μg/mL at week 6, and >12 μg/mL during maintenance may be associated with better outcomes, though cause-effect relationship remains unclear.

Among the risk factors associated with reflux symptoms and that decrease the quality of life are stress, overweight and an increase in body weight. The concept of health-related quality of life (HRQL) covers an expanded effect of the disease on a patient's wellbeing and daily activities and is one of the measures of widely understood quality of life. HRQL is commonly measured using a self-administered, disease-specific questionnaires.To determine the effect of reflux symptoms, stress and body mass index (BMI) on the quality of life.The study included 118 patients diagnosed with reflux disease who reported to an outpatient department of gastroenterology or a specialist hospital ward for planned diagnostic tests. Assessment of the level of reflux was based on the frequency of  typical of GERD symptoms. HRQL was measured by a 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and level of stress using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale. Multi-variable relationships were analyzed using multiple regression.Eleven models of analysis were performed in which the scale of the SF-36 was included as an explained variable. In all models, the same set of explanatory variables: Gender, age, reflux symptoms, stress and BMI, were included. The frequency of GERD symptoms resulted in a decrease in patients' results according to 6 out of 8 SF-36 scales- except for mental health and vitality scales. Stress resulted in a decrease in patient function in all domains measured using the SF-36. Age resulted in a decrease in physical function and in overall assessment of self-reported state of health. An increasing BMI exerted a negative effect on physical fitness and limitations in functioning resulting from this decrease.In GERD patients, HRQL is negatively determined by the frequency of reflux symptoms and by stress, furthermore an increasing BMI and age decreases the level of physical function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583091>Inflammatory bowel disease in patients undergoing renal biopsies.</a></h2><p>There are no good data in the literature on the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease () in patients with kidney disease and we do not know whether  affects the course of kidney disease or if the type of  is an influential factor.

Seventy-two patients were randomly assigned to a group that underwent genotype analysis for the NUDT15 variant (rs116855232) and FTO variant (rs79206939) and 3 common TPMT variants (rs1800460, rs1800462, rs1142345) associated with myelosuppression and 92 patients were assigned to a group that did not undergo genotype analysis (non-genotyping group). Patients heterozygous for any variant received 50 mg azathioprine equivalents, whereas those who were homozygous for any variant received alternative drugs. Patients who did not carry any of the genetic variants and patients in the non-genotyping group received 50 mg azathioprine equivalents followed by dose escalation up to 2-2. mg/kg. Myelosuppression was defined as white blood cell counts below 3000/μL, levels of hemoglobin 10 g/dL, or platelet counts below 100 K/μL.Twelve patients (16.7%) in the genotype analysis group and 33 patients (35.9%) in the non-genotyping group developed myelosuppression (P=.005).

We investigated the effects of anti-TNF agents on gut microbe community structure and function in a longitudinal 2-step study of patients with . We correlated our findings with outcomes of treatment and investigated patterns of metabolites in fecal samples before and after anti-TNF therapy.We performed a prospective study of 2 cohorts of patients in Germany; the discovery cohort comprised 12 patients with , 17 patients with rheumatic disease, and 19 healthy individuals (controls); fecal samples were collected at baseline and 2, 6, and 30 weeks after induction of anti-TNF therapy. The validation cohort comprised 23 patients with  treated with anti-TNF or vedolizumab (anti-α4β7 integrin) and 99 healthy controls; fecal samples were collected at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, and 14. Fecal microbiota were analyzed by V3-V4 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Clinical response and remission were determined by clinical disease activity scores. Metabolic network reconstruction and associated fecal metabolite level inference was performed in silico using the AGORA (Assembly of Gut Organisms through Reconstruction and Analysis) resource. Metabolomic analyses of fecal samples from a subset of patients were performed to validate metabolites associated with treatment outcomes.Anti-TNF therapy shifted the diversity of fecal microbiota in patients with , but not with rheumatic disease, toward that of controls. Across timepoints, diversity indices did not vary significantly between patients with  who did or did not achieve clinical remission after therapy. In contrast, in silico modeling of metabolic interactions between gut microbes found metabolite exchange to be significantly reduced at baseline in fecal samples from patients with  and to be associated with later clinical remission. Predicted levels of butyrate and substrates involved in butyrate synthesis (ethanol or acetaldehyde) were significantly associated with clinical remission following anti-TNF therapy, verified by fecal metabolomic analyses.Metabolic network reconstruction and assessment of metabolic profiles of fecal samples might be used to identify patients with  likely to achieve clinical remission following anti-TNF therapy and increase our understanding of the heterogeneity of .Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Telemedicine-based health services may potentially bridge gaps in access to gastroenterologists in remote and underserved areas.We conducted a needs assessment for  specialist care in Ontario using health administrative data. As part of a separate initiative to address geographic disparities in access to care, we described the development and implementation of our Promoting Access and Care through Centres of Excellence (PACE) Telemedicine Program. Over the first 18 months, we measured wait times and potential cost savings.We found substantial deficiencies in specialist care early in the course of  and continuous  care in regions where the number of gastroenterologists per capita were low. The PACE Telemedicine Program enabled new  consultations within a median time of 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7-32 days) and visits for active  symptoms with a median time of 8. days (IQR, 4-14 days). Forty-five percent of new consultations and 83% of patients with active  symptoms were seen within the target wait time of two weeks. Telemedicine services resulted in an estimated cost savings of $47,565 among individuals who qualified for Ontario's Northern Travel Grant.The implementation of telemedicine services for  is highly feasible and can reduce wait times to see gastroenterologists that meet nationally recommended targets and can lead to cost savings.© The Author(s) 2018.

PubMed was searched for original articles, published between 2007 and 2017, in Italian or English. The search string consisted of a combination of free text and MeSH terms with a common part that focused on HADs and a disease-specific part. All identified papers were screened by two independent reviewers; exclusion criteria were the following: no details of algorithms reported, algorithm not developed in the Italian context, exclusive use of data from the death certificate register, or from general practitioner or pediatrician databases. Pertinent papers were classified according to the objective for which the algorithm had been used, and only articles that used algorithms for primary objectives (I disease occurrence, II population/cohort selection, III outcome identification) were considered for algorithm extraction. The HADs used (hospital discharge records, drug prescriptions, etc.), ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, ATC classification of drugs, followback periods, and age ranges applied by the algorithms have been reported. Further information on specific objective(s), accuracy measures, sensitivity analyses and the contribution of each HAD, have also been recorded.the search string led to the identification of 98 articles for , 42 articles for CD, and 390 for CKD. By screening the references, one paper for  was added. Finally, this led to , 9, and 8 pertinent papers respectively for , CD, and CKD. Considering the papers on  and CD, specific age selections were applied to focus on children and young adult populations. When a selection on age was applied for CKD, instead, it mostly considered individuals aged more than 18 years. Three algorithms for , 4 for CD, and  for CKD were extracted from papers and characterized. Drug prescription databases were used for both  and CKD algorithms, whereas the hospital discharge database and co-payment exemption database were used for  and CD. Pathology records and specialist visit databases were also used for CD and CKD, respectively. For each disease only one algorithm applied criteria for the exclusion of prevalent cases. External validation was performed only for Crohn's disease among IBDs, in one algorithm.the results of this review indicate that case identification for  and CD from routinely collected data can be considered feasible and can be used to perform different kinds of epidemiological studies. The same is not true for CKD, which requires further efforts, mainly to improve the detection of early stage patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560755>Incidence, Duration, and Management of Anemia: A Nationwide Comparison Between  and Non- Populations.</a></h2><p>Although the prevalence of anemia has been extensively studied in the inflammatory bowel disease () population, no study has evaluated the duration of time  patients remain anemic over the course of their disease. Our aims were to determine the incidence, duration of anemia, and rate of receipt of iron therapy among  patients and compare these with non- patients.We conducted a retrospective nationwide cohort study among the US veteran population from January 2011 to September 2018. Inflammatory bowel disease patients who were not anemic at the time of first  medication were included and matched with non- patients. We estimated the incidence of anemia, duration of time patients spent in an anemic state per year, and rate of anemia treatment among  and matched non- patients.A total of 3114  patients were included and matched to 5568 non- patients. The incidence rate of anemia was 92.75 per 1000 person-years in the  group vs 51.18 per 1000 person-years in the non- group. The mean (SD) number of anemia days per year in the  and non- groups was 52. (82.1) and 27.3 (62.4), respectively (P ≤ 0.001). Although anemic  patients were more likely to receive iron therapy compared with non- anemic patients, only 37% and 2.8% of anemic  patients received oral or intravenous iron therapy during follow-up, respectively.Inflammatory bowel disease patients spent almost 2 months of each year of follow-up in an anemic state. Greater efforts are needed to decrease the duration of time patients remain in an anemic state.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384307>Endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease: from guidelines to real life.</a></h2><p>Endoscopy has a central role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (), providing crucial data for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions, treating disease-related complications, and assisting in the early detection of dysplasia and prevention of colorectal cancer in the setting of . Treatment targets have significantly shifted in , focusing on achieving mucosal healing, a more meaningful endpoint than clinical remission. With the emergence of novel therapies, we aim to alter the course of the disease and prevent irreversible damage to the bowel. To that end, obtaining reliable and reproducible assessments of endoscopic disease activity has become an issue of great importance. Although several guidelines include recommendations regarding endoscopic surveillance in patients with long-standing , there is an open debate regarding the best examination method and the appropriate follow-up intervals. Another important issue is whether surveillance guidelines are actually implemented in real-life practice and what is the preferred surveillance method among endoscopists. Significant changes have occurred in the endoscopic world with the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities and their incorporation in everyday practice. We aimed to assess the real-life application of guideline recommendations regarding endoscopy in  patients and to review newly emerged data which might impact these recommendations in the near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401142>Infliximab-Tumor Necrosis Factor Complexes Elicit Formation of Anti-Drug Antibodies.</a></h2><p>Some patients develop anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), which reduce the efficacy of infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor (TNF), in the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases. ADAs arise inconsistently, and it is not clear what factors determine their formation. We investigated features of the immune system, the infliximab antibody, and its complex with TNF that might contribute to ADA generation.C57BL/6 mice were given injections of infliximab and recombinant human TNF or infliximab F(ab') fragments. Blood samples were collected every 2-3 days for 2 weeks and weekly thereafter for up to 6 weeks; infliximab-TNF complexes and ADAs were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Intestinal biopsy and blood samples were obtained from patients having endoscopy who had received infliximab therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases; infliximab-TNF complexes were measured with ELISA. Infliximab-specific plasma cells were detected in patient tissue samples by using mass cytometry. We studied activation of innate immune cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors incubated with infliximab or infliximab-TNF complexes; toll-like receptors (TLRs) were blocked with antibodies, endocytosis was blocked with the inhibitor PitStop2, and cytokine expression was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and ELISAs. Uptake of infliximab and infliximab-TNF complexes by THP-1 cells was measured with confocal microscopy.Mice given increasing doses of infliximab produced increasing levels of ADAs. Blood samples from mice given injections of human TNF and infliximab contained infliximab-TNF complexes; complex formation was associated with ADA formation with an area under the curve of 0.944 (95% confidence interval, 0.851-1.000; P = .003). Intestinal tissues from patients, but not blood samples, contained infliximab-TNF complexes and infliximab-specific plasma cells. Incubation of PBMCs with infliximab-TNF complexes resulted in a 4.74-fold increase in level of interleukin (IL) 1β (IL1B) messenger RNA (P for comparison = .005), increased IL1B protein secretion, and a 2.69-fold increase in the expression of TNF messenger RNA (P for comparison = 0.013) compared with control PBMCs. Infliximab reduced only IL1B and TNF expression. Antibodies against TLR2 or TLR4 did not block the increases in IL1B or TNF expression, but endocytosis was required. THP-1 cells endocytosed higher levels of infliximab-TNF complexes than infliximab alone.In mice, we found ADA formation to increase with dose of infliximab given and concentration of infliximab-TNF complexes detected in blood. Based on studies of human intestinal tissues and blood samples, we propose that infliximab-TNF complexes formed in the intestine are endocytosed by and activate innate immune cells, which increase expression of IL1B and TNF and production of antibodies against the drug complex. It is therefore important to optimize the infliximab dose to a level that is effective but does not activate an innate immune response against the drug-TNF complex.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Processes that contribute to the resulting barrier loss include endocytic occludin removal from the tight junction and reduced occludin expression. Nevertheless, the relatively-normal basal phenotype of occludin knockout (KO) mice has been taken as evidence that occludin does not contribute to gastrointestinal barrier function. We asked whether stress could unmask occludin functions within intestinal epithelia.Wildtype (WT), universal and intestinal epithelial-specific occludin KO, and villin-EGFP-occludin transgenic mice as well as WT and occludin knockdown (KD) Caco-2 cell monolayers were challenged with DSS, TNBS, staurosporine, -FU, or TNF. Occludin and caspase-3 expression were assessed in patient biopsies.Intestinal epithelial occludin loss limited severity of DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis due to epithelial resistance to apoptosis; activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways was blocked in occludin KO epithelia. Promoter analysis revealed that occludin enhances CASP3 transcription and, conversely, that occludin downregulation reduces caspase-3 expression. Analysis of biopsies from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients and normal controls demonstrated that disease-associated occludin downregulation was accompanied by and correlated with reduced caspase-3 expression. In vitro, cytokine-induced occludin downregulation resulted in reduced caspase-3 expression and resistance to intrinsic and extrinsic pathway apoptosis, demonstrating an overall protective effect of inflammation-induced occludin loss.The tight junction protein occludin regulates apoptosis by enhancing caspase-3 transcription. These data suggest that reduced epithelial caspase-3 expression downstream of occludin downregulation is a previously-unappreciated anti-apoptotic process that contributes to mucosal homeostasis in inflammatory conditions.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Different doses of cecropin A were intraperitoneally injected into C57BL/6 mice for  days to determine the safe doses. The injection doses at ≤ 15 mg/kg showed no negative impact on the liver, heart, spleen, and kidney. The severe and moderate  mice model was successfully established via supplementation of 4 or 2.% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for  days. The severe  model was used to ensure the optimal therapeutic dose of cecropin A. Survival rate, body weight and disease activity index (DAI) scores were measured. Administration of 15 mg/kg, not  mg/kg cecropin A, for  days increased survival rate and decreased body weight loss of mice. The moderate  model was applied to investigate the mechanisms for cecropin A to alleviate inflammation in comparison to gentamicin. The mice were treated with 15 mg/kg cecropin A or  mg/kg gentamicin for 3 days. The levels of cytokines and related proteins in the colon were detected by ELISA and Western blotting. The microbiota in cecum contents were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results showed that cecropin A and gentamicin relieved body weight loss, DAI, and gut mucosa disruption, while decreasing tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interlukin-1β (IL-1β), and interlukin-6 (IL-6) induced by DSS. In addition, cecropin A and gentamicin showed different effects on the gut microbiota structure. Both cecropin A and gentamicin decreased DSS-induced enrichment of  and . However, cecropin A showed a selective enrichment of  in contrast to gentamicin, which demonstrated a selective effect on  and . Cecropin A alleviates  through decreasing harmful gut microflora and specifically enhancing beneficial gut microflora. The mechanism of this effect is different from gentamicin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428704>Stratification of inflammatory bowel disease outpatients by disease activity and risk of complications to guide out-of-hospital monitoring: a patient-centred quality improvement project.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is a chronic relapsing-remitting condition affecting 600 000 people in the UK. Traditionally, patients attend outpatient clinics for monitoring regardless of their symptoms or risk of developing complications. This can lead to a mismatch between need and access: patients in remission given elective appointments displace those in need of urgent specialist attention. Novel initiatives implemented in the UK to improve outpatient monitoring have often required a well-maintained patient registry, empowered patients and significant information technology support.In this large-scale quality improvement project at St Mark's Hospital, a tertiary centre for , we stratified over 1000 patients attending three non-complex  clinics over 12 months according to disease activity and risk profile. The aim was to offer a choice and subsequently transfer 50% of eligible patients to specialist nurse-led telephone clinics and demonstrate non-inferior satisfaction levels to existing outpatient follow-up. We also sought to ensure there was timely access to a newly established rapid access clinic for patients requiring urgent specialist attention.A core project team consisting of healthcare professionals, patients and quality improvement scientists met regularly. The team tested and scaled up interventions using 'Plan-Do-Study-Act' cycles within the 'Model for Improvement' framework and analysed data continuously using statistical process charts.Over 12 months, the average number of eligible patients transferred to telephone clinics rose from 17.6% (42/239) using a questionnaire method to 59.3% (73/123) using active discussion in clinic. Patient satisfaction scores remained high and non-inferior to baseline scores in face-to-face clinics. The median waiting time to be seen in the rapid access clinic was 6. days.This is the first published study to report on the successful stratification of patients with  based on disease activity and risk of complications to create a more responsive, sustainable and patient-centred model for  monitoring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648921>Are we choosing wisely for inflammatory bowel disease care?

We collected data on fecal biomarkers, endoscopic severities, and other clinical indices from Cohort 1 (n = 427) and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of FCP measurement and FIT results in determining clinical severity, based on Mayo score, and endoscopic remission, based on Mayo endoscopic sub-score (MES) or UC endoscopic index of severity. We also followed 452 patients in clinical remission from UC (Cohort 2) for 12 months and evaluated the associations of FCP levels and FIT results with clinical recurrence.The levels of FCP and FIT each correlated with the MES and UC endoscopic index of severity. There were no significant differences in the areas under the curve of FCP vs FIT in distinguishing patients with MES≤1 from those with MES≥2 (P = .394) or in distinguishing patients with MES=0 from those with MES≥1 (P = .178). Among 405 patients in clinical remission at baseline, 38 (9.4%) had UC recurrences within 3 months and 90 (22.2%) had recurrences within 12 months. FCP≥146 mg/kg (hazard ratio [HR], 4.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.80-8.33) and FIT≥77 ng/mL (HR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.76-4.83) were independently associated with clinical recurrence within 12 months. UC recurred within 12 months in 69% of patients with levels of FCP≥146 mg/kg and FIT ≥77 ng/mL; this value was significantly higher than the rate of recurrence in patients with levels of FCP≥146 mg/kg and FIT <77 ng/mL (31.%, P < .001) or patients with levels of FCP<146 mg/kg and FIT ≥77 ng/mL (30.0%, P < .001).In a nationwide study of patients with UC in Japan, we found that the level of FCP and FIT could each identify patients with endoscopic markers of disease severity (MES≥2). The combination of FCP and FIT results can identify patients in remission who are at risk for disease recurrence.

However, few studies have been conducted to investigate whether IN is effective even in treatment-refractory cases, such as in those with steroid dependency and anti-TNF refractoriness.In the INDIGO study, 86 patients with active UC were randomly assigned to an IN group (0.-2.0 g daily) or placebo group. The rate of clinical response (CR), mucosal healing (MH), and change in fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels was compared between refractory [patients with steroid-dependent disease, previous use of anti-TNF-α, and concomitant use of immunomodulators (IM)] and non-refractory patients. We also analyzed factors predicting CR and MH at week 8.The rates of CR of IN group were significantly higher than placebo group, even in patients with steroid-dependent disease (p < 0.001), previous use of anti-TNF-α (p = 0.002), and concomitant use of IM (p = 0.013). The rates of MH in IN group were significantly higher than in placebo group in patients with steroid-dependent disease (p = 0.009). In the IN group, median FCP levels, at week 8, were significantly lower than baseline in patients with steroid-dependent disease and patients with the previous use of anti-TNF-α (p < 0.001, respectively).

We examined time trends and risk factors for reoperation in patients with CD who underwent intestinal surgery, focusing on the effects of postoperative medical treatments.We performed a retrospective analysis of 1871 patients with CD who underwent initial intestinal resection at 10 tertiary care institutions in Japan, with an initial surgical date after May 1982. We collected data on the background characteristics of all patients, including Montreal Classification, smoking status, and medical therapy after surgery (tumor necrosis factor antagonists [anti-TNF] agents or immunomodulators). The primary outcome was requirement for first reoperation. Rate of reoperation was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and risk factors for reoperation were identified using the Cox regression model.The overall cumulative - and 10-year reoperation rates were 23.4% and 48.0%, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that patients who underwent the initial surgery after May 2002 had a significantly lower rate of reoperation than patients who underwent surgery before April 2002 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61-0.86). Preoperative smoking (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18-1.68), perianal disease (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.27-1.77), and ileocolic type of CD (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.20-1.69) were significant risk factors for reoperation.

Fecal calprotectin is commonly used to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease () and has an average sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 96%. For diagnosing pediatric , calprotectin fecal tests have similar sensitivity (92%) but substantially less specificity (76%). Low specificity, especially in pediatric patients, means a high likelihood of false negative diagnoses, suggesting that a substantial number of active  cases remain undiagnosed and untreated. To improve on calprotectin as an effective  monitoring tool in pediatric populations, specificity must be increased. To develop an assay with higher specificity in pediatric patients, we identified a panel of multiple proteins that are present in both  flare and remission but have distinct abundance ranges between each condition. From a pilot cohort of 10 pediatric patients in states of either active disease or remission, we discovered and relatively quantified hundreds of stool proteins. Of these, our mass spectrometry-based study prioritized at least  that have potential to augment negative predictive power of mucosal-level inflammation alongside fecal biomarkers such as calprotectin.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

In light of previous studies, we explored the therapeutic potential of IRF8 inhibition as immunomodulatory therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (). To this end, we utilized siRNA-loaded lipid-based nanoparticles (siLNPs) and demonstrated a ∼90% reduction of IRF8 mRNA levels in vitro (PV < 0.0001), alongside a notable reduction in IRF8 protein. Moreover, silencing IRF8 ex vivo in splenocytes lead to a profound downregulation of IRF8 protein, followed by an immunomodulatory effect, as represented by a decrease in the secretion of TNFα, IL6 and IL12/IL23 (IL12p40) proinflammatory cytokines (PV = 0.0045, 0.0330, <0.0001, respectively). In order to silence IRF8 in vivo, selectively in inflammatory leukocytes, we used siLNPs that were coated with anti-Ly6C antibodies via our recently published ASSET targeting approach. Through this strategy, we have demonstrated a selective binding of the targeted-LNPs (T-LNPs) to Ly6C + inflammatory leukocytes. Finally, an immunomodulatory effect was demonstrated in vivo in an  mouse model with a profound decrease of TNFα, IL6, IL12/IL23, and IL1β pro-inflammatory cytokines (n = , PV < 0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.02, respectively) and an improvement of colon-morphology as assessed by colon-length measurements and colonoscopy (PV < 0.0001). Overall, using antibody-targeted siLNPs, we showed a notable reduction of IRF8 mRNA and protein and demonstrated a targeted immunomodulation therapeutic effect ex vivo and in vivo, in the DSS colitis model. We claim that a selective silencing of IRF8 in inflammatory leukocytes (such as Ly6C+) may serve as a therapeutic approach for treating inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that implementation of ERP for  patients is associated with shorter LOS and improved economic outcomes.An IRB-approved prospective clinical database was used to identify consecutive patients from 2015 to 2017. Patients were grouped as "pre-ERP" and "post-ERP" based on the date of implementation of a comprehensive ERP. Ileostomy closures, redo pouch operations, and outpatient operations were excluded. The relationship between ERP, LOS, and secondary outcomes was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis.Overall, a total of 671 patients were included: 345 (51.4%) with Crohn's disease (CD) and 326 (48.6%) with ulcerative colitis (UC). Of these, 425 were pre-ERP (63.4%), and 246 were post-ERP (36.6%). The groups did not differ in terms of age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) scores, comorbidities, estimated blood loss, or ostomy construction. The post-ERP group had a significantly higher mean body mass index (BMI), more patients with CD, longer operative time, and more minimally invasive surgery (MIS; all P < 0.05). The post-ERP group had a significantly shorter LOS (6 vs 4. days, median), whereas mean hospital costs decreased by 15.7%. There was no difference in readmissions or complications. On multivariate analysis, MIS and ERP use were both associated with a shorter LOS.Inflammatory bowel disease patients benefit from the use of ERP, demonstrating decreased LOS and costs without an increase in complications and readmissions. Enhanced recovery pathways should be routinely implemented in this often challenging patient population.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Limited literature exists regarding SILS total/subtotal colectomies for inflammatory bowel disease (). Aim of the study was to present the initial experience with this type of approach in a district general hospital and extrapolate its feasibility and safety in this specific context based on gold standard outcomes reported in literature.  Preoperative parameters, operative details and surgical outcomes of consecutive patients who underwent colonic SILS for  in a -year period were reviewed retrospectively. Median length of follow-up was 26 months.  Fourteen patients underwent SILS subtotal/total colectomy. Median body mass index was 25 (18.1-35). Two patients had previous abdominal surgeries. Median operating time was 202. minutes. Two cases were converted to open. Median length of stay was  days. Three patients presented complications. Three patients developed parastomal hernias (21.4%). Five out of 12 patients with ulcerative colitis declined further surgery, 3 are awaiting laparoscopic/SILS pouch formation, 1 underwent SILS pouch formation, 1 SILS ileo-rectal anastomosis and 1 patient had SILS completion proctectomy. One patient was not followed up.  Despite literature data heterogeneity, these results provide support to the feasibility and applicability of SILS in the subgroup of patients who undergo subtotal/total colectomies for , offering the option for subsequent SILS completion or restorative procedures.

All studies were reported by 1 reading physician. Data included demographics and requested information on medication use, prior imaging studies, and hemoglobin and ferritin levels. In a total of 620 (46%) patients, CE was indicated for occult gastrointestinal bleeding or IDA. Positive findings on CE were separated into "definite" and "possible." Multinomial regression analysis was used to determine the variables correlated with definite CE findings. A survey analysis was then used to assess how the study results impacted further management.With regard to the 620 patients, the mean age was 62.9 years, mean hemoglobin level was 89 g/L, and median ferritin level was 9 μg/L. A total of 210 (33.9%) patients had positive findings (definite: 23%, possible: 10.8%). Vascular ectasias were the majority of definite findings (47.%). Predictors of definite findings were age (relative risk ratio: 1.04; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.06) and male sex (relative risk ratio: 1.88; 95% confidence interval: 1.25-2.83). An overall 12.7% of positive studies required therapeutic intervention, with 65.8% undergoing further workup.We report a 33.9% positive yield, with 65.8% of patients undergoing further workup as a result of CE and 12.7% requiring therapeutic intervention.

Recently, plasma measurements of calprotectin have been shown to be more reliable than serum measurements. In this study, we aim to assess plasma and serum calprotectin measurements as biomarkers of disease activity in paediatric and adult ulcerative colitis.  Paediatric (-18 years) and adult (>18 years) patients scheduled for colonoscopy due to suspected or confirmed ulcerative colitis were included prospectively. Stool and blood samples were collected at time of colonoscopy and patient symptom scores were recorded. At colonoscopy the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity was recorded. Histology was graded according to the Geboes score.  84 patients where included; 30 paediatric and 54 adult patients. Plasma calprotectin had a stronger correlation to all outcome variables than serum calprotectin. Plasma calprotectin correlated positively to disease extent ( = 0.53,  < .0001), symptoms scores ( = 0.54,  = .002, only in the paediatric cohort), endoscopic scores ( = 0.39,  = .0003), histological scores (Rho 0.28,  = .01) and, when using endoscopic assessment of severity as reference, could discriminate active disease from patients in remission ( = .03).

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the outcomes of obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m) versus non-obese patients undergoing surgery for inflammatory bowel disease ().PubMed, Scopus, and Embase libraries were searched up to March 2019 for studies comparing outcomes of obese with non-obese patients undergoing surgery for . A meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager software to create forest plots and calculate odds ratios and mean differences.Four thousand three hundred and eleven patients from five observational studies were included. Obese patients were older at the time of surgery and more likely to have diabetes. Obese patients had longer operative times (MD 23.28, 95% CI 14.63-31.93, p < 0.001), higher intra-operative blood loss (MD 45.32, 95% CI .89-84.76, p = 0.02), longer length of stay (MD 0.90, 95% CI 0.60-1.20, p < 0.001), higher wound infection rates (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.39-2.23, p < 0.001), and higher total postoperative complication rates (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-1.70, p = 0.02).Obesity is associated with significantly worse outcomes following -specific surgery, including longer operative times, greater blood loss, longer length of stay, higher wound infection rates, and higher total postoperative complication rates.

However, available data are limited, and controversy remains regarding the best treatment approach for  patients who develop prostate cancer.A retrospective cohort study across 4 Department of Veterans Affairs hospital systems. Patients with established  who were diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer between 1996-2015 were included. We assessed for flares of , -related hospitalizations, and -related surgeries within 6, 12, and 24 months of cancer diagnosis and survival at 1, 2, and  years. Flares of  were those documented as such by the treating physician, and treatment changed accordingly.One hundred patients with  and prostate cancer were identified. Forty-seven were treated with either treatment with external beam radiation or brachytherapy, and 53 were treated with nonradiation modalities. Comparing cohorts with or without radiation treatment, there were no differences in baseline  characteristics, Charlson comorbidity index, or prostate cancer stage. Inflammatory bowel disease flares were 2-fold higher for radiation-treated patients within 6 months (10.6% vs .7%) and 6-12 months (4.3% vs 1.9%) after cancer diagnosis. On multiple logistic regression analysis, radiation treatment (adjusted odds ratio, 4.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-20.26) was a significant predictor of flares. However, rates of -related hospitalizations or surgeries were not significantly different.In this retrospective, multicenter study, 2-fold higher rates of flare were found within the first year after prostate cancer diagnosis for patients treated with radiation, but there were no differences in -related hospitalizations or surgeries. Although patients should be counseled of these risks, avoidance of radiation therapy in  patients with prostate cancer is likely not necessary.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

There were no differences in readmission rates (66.7% versus 53.8%,  = .) or reoperation rates (50% versus 30.8%,  = .3) between groups. Forty percent of patients experienced a complication after IPAA. Complication rates were similar between two-stage and three-stage IPAA groups (38.% versus 50%,  = .33). Complications within the two-stage group included anastomotic leak, pouchitis, wound infection, anastomotic stricture, and incarcerated hernia. Complications within the three-stage group included bloody ostomy output, dehydration, anastomotic stricture, small bowel obstruction, and pouch volvulus.

In the biologic era, it still remains the treatment of choice in mild-to-moderate UC. Positioning of this therapeutic class in moderate-to-severe UC is less clear. : Several studies demonstrated the ability of -ASA to induce endoscopic remission to a similar extent as anti-TNF therapy on the moderate segment of UC. Histologic remission is achieved after induction in up to 45% of patients treated with topical -ASA and 30% with oral formulations. Aminosalicylates offer a favorable safety profile compared to that of immunomodulators and biologics. High-dose -ASA therapy may be a valuable option for patients with moderately active disease, and physicians should weigh the pros and cons of this strategy in selected patients. Whether aminosalicylates should be continued in combination with thiopurines or biologic therapy remains under debate. : In the era of biologics, aminosalicylates remain the first-line therapy in patients with mild UC, and have to be considered in case of moderate UC, given their favorable risk-benefit profile. We suggest that -ASA should be used in moderate patients without poor prognostic factors, while biologics should be preferred otherwise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650614>HLADQA1*05 genotype predicts anti-drug antibody formation and loss of response during infliximab therapy for inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) are a leading contributor to infliximab loss of response and adverse drug events.

Antibiotics represent the mainstay of treatment, suggesting a crucial role of dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of this condition. Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents have been shown to adversely impact the gut microbiome and local host immunity.The aim of this study is to assess the effect of prior exposure to biologics on the development of pouchitis in patients who have ulcerative colitis.This is a retrospective case-control study.This study was conducted at a tertiary-care  center.Consecutive patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent restorative proctocolectomy between 2000 and 2010 were included.The primary outcome measured was the incidence of pouchitis.Four hundred seventeen patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent IPAA were included. The incidence of pouchitis was 40.4%. There were no differences in patient demographics, disease-specific factors, surgical approach, and short-term postoperative complications between patients who developed pouchitis compared to those that did not. Patients exposed to anti-tumor necrosis factor agents or preoperative steroids were significantly more likely to develop pouchitis (anti-tumor necrosis factor: 47.9% vs 36.%, p = 0.027; steroids: 41.7% vs 23.3%, p = 0.048). However, on multivariable analysis, only anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy was an independent predictor for pouchitis (p = 0.05). Pouchitis was not associated with adverse long-term outcomes.The retrospective design was a limitation of this study.In a large cohort of patients undergoing IPAA for ulcerative colitis with at least a -year follow-up, anti-tumor necrosis factor exposure was the only independent risk factor for the development of pouchitis. These agents may "precondition" the pouch to develop pouchitis through alterations in the microbiome and/or local host immunity of the terminal ileum.

The aim of this study was therefore to quantify the prevalence and association between  and psoriasis.PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched from database inception through April 2018 for studies reporting data on psoriasis among patients with  and vice versa. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate, respectively, the prevalence and association between  and psoriasis. Data extraction was according to the PRISMA guideline, and quality assessment was made using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The main outcomes were the proportion of psoriasis patients with  and vice versa, as well as the association (odds ratio [OR]) of  in psoriasis and psoriasis in , respectively.Based on quantitative analysis of 93 studies, the prevalence of psoriasis in CD and UC was 3.6% (95% CI 3.1%-4.6%) and 2.8% (95% CI 2.0%-3.8%) respectively, while the prevalence of CD and UC was 0.7% (95% CI 0.2%-1.3%) and 0.% (95% CI 0.3%-0.8%), respectively, among patients with psoriasis. Presence of CD or UC was significantly associated with psoriasis given by OR=2.0 (95% CI 1.4-2.9) and OR=1. (95% CI 1.2-2.0), respectively. Presence of psoriasis was significantly associated with CD (OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.1) and UC (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.0).We found significant bidirectional associations between psoriasis and  warranting increased awareness among clinicians in the diagnostic process, especially in children and adolescents with .

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and antidrug antibody measurement are increasingly used in this setting.To establish a consensus on the use of TDM in the context of loss of response to anti-TNFs, we performed a vote using a Delphi-style process followed by an expert panel discussion among 8  specialists practicing in Switzerland, Europe. Statements were rated on an even Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strong disagreement) to 4 (strong agreement), based on expert opinion and the available literature.The experts agreed on the following statements: (i) loss of response is associated with inadequate drug levels in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; (ii) best timepoint for measuring drug levels is prior to the next application (= trough levels) with different thresholds for anti-TNF agents (infliximab  μg/mL, adalimumab 8 μg/mL, certolizumab pegol 10 μg/mL); (iii) antidrug antibodies are predictive for loss of response; and (iv) antidrug-antibody titers and drug trough levels are key determinants in the treatment algorithm. Data about non-anti-TNF biologics were considered too limited to propose recommendations.A Delphi-style consensus among 8  experts shows that TDM and measurement of antidrug-antibody titers are useful in the context of loss of response to anti-TNF. Optimal cutoff levels depend on the type of anti-TNF. These values are critical in the decision making process. More studies are needed to address the value of such measurements for non-anti-TNF biologics.© 2019 S.

However, whether miR-219a-5p is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease () remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-219a-5p expression was significantly decreased in the inflamed intestinal mucosa and peripheral blood (PB)-CD4 T cells from patients with . Proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and TNF-α) inhibited miR-219a-5p expression in CD4 T cells in vitro. Lentivirus-mediated miR-219a-5p downregulation facilitated Th1/Th17 cell differentiation, whereas miR-219a-5p overexpression exerted an opposite effect. Luciferase assays confirmed that ETS variant  (ETV5) was a functional target of miR-219a-5p and ETV5 expression was significantly increased in the inflamed intestinal mucosa and PB-CD4 T cells from  patients. ETV5 overexpression enhanced Th1/Th17 immune response through upregulating the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT4. Importantly, supplementation of miR-219a-5p ameliorated TNBS-induced intestinal mucosal inflammation, characterized by decreased IFN-γ CD4 T cells and IL-17A CD4 T cells infiltration in the colonic lamina propria. Our data thus reveal a novel mechanism whereby miR-219a-5p suppresses intestinal inflammation through inhibiting Th1/Th17-mediated immune responses. miR-219a-5p might be a target for the treatment of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580261>Hemorrhoidectomy and Excision of Skin Tags in : Harbinger of Doom or Simply a Disease Running Its Course?</a></h2><p>Controversy in performing hemorrhoidectomy and anal skin tag excision in patients with  stems from dated reports of nonhealing wounds resulting in proctectomy.This study aimed to determine the safety of interventional management of hemorrhoids or anal skin tags in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.This study is a retrospective review of patient records from 2000 to 2017.The patient records were retrieved from a multistate health system.Adult patients with  undergoing interventional management of hemorrhoids or skin tags were included.The primary outcome measured was the long-term requirement of proctectomy.Ninety-seven patients (n = 49 Crohn's disease, 48 ulcerative colitis) underwent interventional management of hemorrhoids or anal skin tags (n =35 rubber band ligation, 27 anal skin tag excision, 21 hemorrhoidectomy, 14 excision/incision of thrombosed hemorrhoid). Thirty-day complications were observed in  patients (n = 4 urinary retention, 1 perianal abscess). Five patients with Crohn's disease eventually required proctectomy at a median of 7 years after skin tag excision (range, 6 months to 10 years), but none were secondary to impaired wound healing. Two patients with ulcerative colitis who had previously undergone IPAA were subsequently diagnosed with Crohn's disease of the pouch after skin tag excision. No other long-term complications were seen in patients with ulcerative colitis.The study's retrospective design does not allow identification of patients with  who underwent only medical management of their hemorrhoids. There is also selection bias in which patients were selected for interventional management of their disease.The requirement for proctectomy after hemorrhoidectomy/skin tag excision appears to be secondary to the natural disease course of perianal Crohn's disease rather than perianal intervention. Selective hemorrhoidectomy and skin tag excision in patients with well-controlled luminal disease should be considered.

The treat-to-target strategy, emphasizing proactive assessment and optimizing treatment, is commonly applied in the clinical setting. Although colonoscopies are essential for this strategy to be successful, bowel preparation and sedative drugs are required for paediatric patients. We attempted to verify the usefulness of sigmoidoscopy, which is less invasive than colonoscopy, combined with faecal calprotectin, to assess mucosal healing.A total of 58 paediatric patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and followed up at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2015 to May 2018 were enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory findings (including faecal calprotectin and endoscopic data) were collected from medical records. The predictive power of mucosal healing of sigmoid colon and rectum (s-MH) combined with faecal calprotectin to predict mucosal healing throughout the colon was analysed.Among 58 patients (mean age 16.13 ± 2.88 years), 18 (31.0%) were in mucosal healing status. The median faecal calprotectin level was 486. μg/g.

Chemically induced colitis models are relatively easy and rapid to develop. The 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model is one of the main models in the experimental studies of inflammatory bowel disease () since inflammation induced by TNBS mimics several features of Crohn's disease. This review aims to summarize the existing literature and discuss different protocols for the induction of chronic model of TNBS-induced colitis. We searched MEDLINE via Pubmed platform for studies published through December 2018, using MeSH terms (Crohn Disease.kw) OR (Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.kw) OR (Colitis, Ulcerative.kw) AND (trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid.kw) AND (disease models, animal.kw) AND (mice.all). The inclusion criteria were original articles, preclinical studies in vivo using mice, chronic model of colitis, and TNBS as the inducer of colitis and articles published in English. Chronic TNBS-induced colitis is made with multiple TNBS intrarectal administrations in an average dose of 1.2 mg using a volume lower than 150 μL in 50% ethanol. The strains mostly used are Balb/c and C57BL/6 with -6 weeks. To characterize the preclinical model the parameters more used include body weight, stool consistency and morbidity, inflammatory biomarkers like interferon (IFN)-γ, myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10, presence of ulcers, thickness or hyperemia in the colon, and histological evaluation of the inflammation.

A total of 961 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous induction dose of ustekinumab (either 130 mg [320 patients] or a weight-range-based dose that approximated 6 mg per kilogram of body weight [322]) or placebo (319). Patients who had a response to induction therapy 8 weeks after administration of intravenous ustekinumab were randomly assigned again to receive subcutaneous maintenance injections of 90 mg of ustekinumab (either every 12 weeks [172 patients] or every 8 weeks [176]) or placebo (175). The primary end point in the induction trial (week 8) and the maintenance trial (week 44) was clinical remission (defined as a total score of ≤2 on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components).The percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 8 among patients who received intravenous ustekinumab at a dose of 130 mg (15.6%) or 6 mg per kilogram (15.%) was significantly higher than that among patients who received placebo (.3%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among patients who had a response to induction therapy with ustekinumab and underwent a second randomization, the percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 44 was significantly higher among patients assigned to 90 mg of subcutaneous ustekinumab every 12 weeks (38.4%) or every 8 weeks (43.8%) than among those assigned to placebo (24.0%) (P = 0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). The incidence of serious adverse events with ustekinumab was similar to that with placebo. Through 52 weeks of exposure, there were two deaths (one each from acute respiratory distress syndrome and hemorrhage from esophageal varices) and seven cases of cancer (one each of prostate, colon, renal papillary, and rectal cancer and three nonmelanoma skin cancers) among 825 patients who received ustekinumab and no deaths and one case of cancer (testicular cancer) among 319 patients who received placebo.Ustekinumab was more effective than placebo for inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.

One of these biomarkers may be serum calprotectin (SC).a prospective study was performed of patients with  due to undergo a colonoscopy as part of the common clinical practice. The study parameters included SC, fecal calprotectin (FC) and conventional blood test parameters. Clinical indices (Harvey and Walmsley) and relevant endoscopic scores were completed for each scenario (Simple Endoscopic Score Crohn Disease [SES-CD] and Mayo).fifty-three patients were included in the study, 51% (27 patients) with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 49% (26 patients) with Crohn's disease (CD). The CS values in UC were significantly higher with an endoscopic Mayo score 2/3 (median score 10.39 mg/ml [IQR: 7.4-12.2]) compared to those with a Mayo score of 0/1 (median 4.07 mg/ml [IQR: 2.9-7.2]) (p = 0.01). The area under the ROC curve (AUCROC) was 0.85 and the sensitivity and specificity were 83.3% and 81.25%, respectively, for a SC cut-off point of 4.4 mg/dl. Furthermore, a higher AUCROC was obtained in comparison with other serological markers for activity (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], hemoglobin [Hb] and platelets). There were no statistically significant differences in the comparison between SC and endoscopic findings in CD (SES CD > 3: 20.1 [IQR: 16.8-23.4] vs SESC ≤ 3:6.25 [IQR: .4-7.1]) (p = 0.8).SC is a good indirect marker of inflammatory activity and there was a correlation with endoscopic findings in UC.

The aims of this study were to assess the relationship between maintenance anti-TNF levels and perianal fistula outcomes.This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients receiving maintenance adalimumab or infliximab therapy (minimum 24 weeks) for the treatment of Crohn's disease with associated perianal fistulas, who had anti-TNF drug/antibody levels (trough for infliximab) measured within 4 weeks of clinical assessment. The primary outcome was the association of anti-TNF levels with perianal fistula healing defined as the absence of drainage. The secondary outcome was the association of anti-TNF levels with complete perianal fistula closure.A total of 64 patients (adalimumab, n = 35; infliximab, n = 29) were included. Patients with fistula healing had higher levels of anti-TNF vs. those without fistula healing (adalimumab: 12.6 vs. 2.7 μg/mL, P < 0.01; infliximab: 8.1 vs. 3.2 μg/mL, P < 0.01). Patients with fistula closure also had significantly higher anti-TNF levels vs. those without fistula closure (adalimumab: 14.8 vs. .7 μg/mL, P < 0.01; infliximab: 8.2 vs. 3.2 μg/mL, P < 0.01). For adalimumab, receiver operator characteristic analysis identified an optimum level of >6.8 μg/mL and >9.8 μg/mL for fistula healing and closure, respectively.

Socio-economic parameters and quality of life were assessed by  Questionnaire (IBDQ-32) and additional items. Treatment costs were calculated for medication, surgery and hospitalisation.The percentage of transfer group patients with an -related intestinal complication was higher compared to the transition group (64% vs. 21%, p = 0.022). We also found a tendency towards a higher number of -related surgery in the transfer group compared to the transition group (46% vs. 13%, p = 0.077). Transfer group patients received higher mean cumulated doses of radiation compared with the transition group (4.2 ± .3 mSv vs. 0.01 ± 0.01 mSv, p = 0.036).

However, in previous investigations we have found a minority of cases displaying a relatively favorable behavior, thus outlining the need to improve the histopathologic prediction of Crohn's disease-associated small bowel carcinoma prognosis.As in recent studies on colorectal cancer a substantial improvement in prognostic evaluations has been provided by the histologic analysis of the tumor invasive front, we therefore systematically analyzed the tumor budding and poorly differentiated clusters in the invasive front of 47 Crohn's disease-associated small bowel carcinomas collected through the Small Bowel Cancer Italian Consortium.Both tumor budding and poorly differentiated cluster analyses proved highly effective in prognostic evaluation of Crohn's disease-associated small bowel carcinomas. In addition, they retained prognostic value when combined with two other parameters, i.e. glandular histology and stage I/II, both known to predict a relatively favorable small bowel carcinoma behavior. In particular, association of tumor budding and poorly differentiated clusters in a combined invasive front score allowed to identify a minor subset of cancers (12/47, 25%), characterized by combined invasive front-low grade coupled with a glandular histology and a low stage (I or II) and showing no cancer-related death during a median follow-up of 73. months.The improved distinction of lower from higher grade Crohn's disease-associated small bowel carcinomas provided by invasive front analysis should be of potential help in choosing appropriate therapy for these rare and frequently ominous neoplasms.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Here, we aimed to provide an overview of the clinical factors associated with the onset of uveitis in the Swiss  Cohort Study (SIBDCS).We included epidemiological and clinical data from 1840 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 1426 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) followed up in the SIBDCS between 2006 and 2018. Associations between disease characteristics and uveitis were assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses.Overall, we identified 285 patients with uveitis. Uveitis was more frequent in patients with CD (11.1%; 205 of 1635) than UC (.6%; 80 of 1346; odds ratio 2.11,  < 0.001). The occurrence of uveitis manifestations in patients with UC and CD was significantly associated with the onset of other extraintestinal manifestations, also in multivariate analyses. The onset of uveitis was associated with the hallmark features of severe disease in both CD and UC, including a higher clinical disease activity index and the use of immunomodulators or calcineurin inhibitors. In CD, uveitis was more frequent in females and showed a positive correlation with a positive family history of .Our data demonstrate that uveitis in  occurs more often in CD as well as in women and is associated with a more severe disease course.

The secondary end point was to provide characterization of incident cancer types.All incident cases of cancer occurring in  patients from December 2011-2017 were prospectively recorded in 16 Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease units. Each of the  patients with a new diagnosis of cancer was matched with 2  patients without cancer, according to  phenotype (ulcerative colitis [UC] vs Crohn's disease [CD]), age (± years), sex. Risk factors were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Cancer occurred in 403  patients: 204 CD (CD cases), 199 UC (UC cases). The study population included 1209 patients (403  cases, 806  controls). Cancer (n = 403) more frequently involved the digestive system (DS; 32%), followed by skin (14.9%), urinary tract (9.7%), lung (6.9%), genital tract (6.%), breast (.%), thyroid (1.9%), lymphoma (2.7%, only in CD), adenocarcinoma of the small bowel (SBA; 3.9%, 15 CD, 1 pouch in UC), other cancers (15.9%). Among cancers of the DS, colorectal cancer (CRC) more frequently occurred in UC (29% vs 17%; P < 0.005), whereas SBA more frequently occurred in CD (13% vs 6.3% P = 0.039). In CD, perforating (B3) vs non-stricturing non-perforating (B1) behavior represented the only risk factor for any cancer (odds ratio [OR], 2.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-4.11). In CD, risk factors for extracolonic cancer (ECC) were a B3 vs B1 and a stricturing (B2) vs B1 behavior (OR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.62-.43; OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.09-2.98). In UC, risk factors for ECC and for overall cancer were abdominal surgery for UC (OR, 4.63; 95% CI, 2.62-8.42; OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.88-.92) and extensive vs distal UC (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.10-2.75; OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.16-3.47). Another risk factor for ECC was left-sided vs distal UC (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.00-2.86). Inflammatory bowel disease duration was a risk factor for skin and urinary tract cancers.Perforating CD, extensive UC, and abdominal surgery for UC were identified as risk factors for overall incident cancer and for ECC.

Purine analogues such as azathioprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) have been used to maintain surgically-induced remission in CD, but the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of these agents remains controversial.To assess the efficacy and safety of purine analogues (AZA and 6-MP) for maintenance of surgically-induced remission in CD.We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane  Group Specialized Register from inception to 26 July 2018 (and from inception to 31 July 2019). In addition, we searched reference lists of all included studies and relevant reviews, conference proceedings and trials registers.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of at least three months that enrolled adults and children with surgically-induced remission of CD and compared AZA or 6-MP to no treatment, placebo or any other active intervention were considered for inclusion.Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The primary outcome was clinical relapse. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic relapse, radiologic and surgical relapse, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), withdrawal due to AEs and health-related quality of life.Ten RCTs with a total of 928 participants were included. Study participants were adults recruited from university clinics and gastroenterology hospitals who received interventions post-surgery for a duration between 12 to 36 months. Most study participants were recruited less than three months after surgery in all except one study where participants were recruited between 6 to 24 months post-surgery. One study was rated as low risk of bias, six studies were rated high risk of bias and three were rated unclear risk of bias.There was moderate certainty evidence that purine analogues are more efficient for preventing clinical relapse than placebo. At 12 to 36 months, 51% (109/215) of AZA/6-MP participants relapsed compared to 64% (124/193) of placebo participants (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.92; 408 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence regarding the efficacy of AZA or 6-MP for maintaining postoperative clinical remission compared to -ASA compounds was low. At 12 to 24 months , 64% (113/177) of purine analogue participants relapsed compared to 59% (101/170) of -ASA participants (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.24; 347 participants; 4 studies; I² = 8%; low certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence that purine analogues are inferior for preventing postsurgical clinical relapse compared to tumour necrosis factor alpha agents (anti-TNF-α) was very low. At 12 to 24 months, 43% (29/67) of AZA participants relapsed compared to 14% (10/72) of anti-TNF-α participants (RR 2.89; 95% CI 1.50 to .57; 139 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence).The effect of purine analogues compounds on AEs compared to placebo or any active treatment was uncertain, as the quality of evidence ranged from very low to low. After 12 to 24 months, 14% (12/87) of purine analogue participants experienced an AE compared to 10% (8/81) of placebo participants (RR 1.36; 95% CI 0.57 to 3.27; 168 participants; 2 studies; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). The effect of purine analogues on AEs compared to -ASA agents was uncertain. After 12 to 24 months, 41% (73/176) of purine analogue participants had an AE compared to 47% (81/171) of -ASA participants (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.07; 346 participants; 4 studies; I² = 15%; low certainty evidence). The effect of purine analogues on AEs in comparison to anti TNF-α agents was uncertain. At 12 to 24 months, 57% (32/56) of AZA participants had an AE compared to 51% (31/61) of anti-TNF-α participants (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.53; 117 participants; 2 studies; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Purine analogue participants were more like than -ASA participants to have a SAE (RR 3.39, 95% CI 1.26 to 9.13, 311 participants; 3 studies; I² = 9%; very low certainty evidence), or to withdraw due to an AE (RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.81; 425 participants;  studies; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Commonly reported AEs across all studies included leucopenia, arthralgia, abdominal pain or severe epigastric intolerance, elevated liver enzymes, nausea and vomiting, pancreatitis, anaemia, nasopharyngitis and flatulence.Moderate certainty evidence suggests that AZA and 6-MP may be superior to placebo for maintenance of surgically-induced remission in participants with CD. There was no clear difference in the number of clinical relapses when purine analogues were compared with -ASA agents, however this is based on low certainty evidence. There was very low certainty evidence that AZA and 6-MP are more likely to result in more serious adverse events (SAEs) and withdrawals due to an AE (low certainty) when compared to -ASA agents. Very low certainty evidence suggests that purine analogues may be inferior to anti-TNF-α agents, however, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Further research investigating the efficacy and safety of AZA and 6-MP in comparison to other active medications in surgically-induced remission of CD is warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493578>Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases is Associated with Milder Clinical Activity but More Frequent Subclinical Inflammation and Growth Impairment.</a></h2><p>Although inflammatory bowel diseases () associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have been well characterized in adults, there have been few pediatric studies, and these were small and produced conflicting results. We investigated features of PSC- in children, compared to children with  without PSC.We performed a retrospective study of 74 children with PSC-, diagnosed from 2000 through 2018, who were each matched with 2 children with ulcerative colitis or -unclassified (controls) based on sex, date of birth, and type of . We compared  distribution and clinical activity (remission, medication use, hospitalization, or colectomy) and patient growth between groups. Data were extracted from each hospital contact and analyzed using mixed effects analyses or Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for time-dependent medication exposure.Higher proportions of children with PSC- had backwash ileitis, pancolitis, and rectal sparing, and more severe right-sided disease, than controls (P<.05). Patients with PSC- were more likely to be treated with only -ASA, compared with controls (odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% CI, 1.44-6.41) and to have  in clinical remission (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.78-4.87). Risk of colectomy or treatment with a biologic agent was lower in patients with PSC- than controls (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.12-0.52). However, determination of  severity based on symptoms underestimated severity based on endoscopic activity in patients with PSC-. Among patients with  in clinical remission, those with PSC were less likely to have endoscopic remission (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.96). Patients with PSC- were shorter and had lower weight over time, compared with controls.In a retrospective study, we found that features of  differed between children with vs without PSC, similar to adults. Despite the mild clinical activity of  in patients with PSC, lack of symptoms does not always indicate lack of mucosal inflammation.

We included new vedolizumab users with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) between 18 and 64 years with ≥12 months of continuous enrollment prior to initiating vedolizumab. Outcomes included treatment persistence >14 weeks, late steroid use, -related surgery and infections associated with hospitalization. We built multivariable regression models to identify predictors of treatment persistence and late steroid use.We identified 269 CD and 187 UC vedolizumab initiators. Only 60% of CD patients and 56% of UC patients remained on vedolizumab after 14 weeks without -related hospitalization, surgery, and corticosteroid use. There were no significant predictors of treatment persistence. Steroid use in the first 2 months of vedolizumab initiation was a significant predictor of late steroid use in CD (odds ratio: 23.34; 95% confidence interval: .10-153.89). In the 6 months after vedolizumab initiation, 1.9% of CD and .9% of UC patients had an -related surgery. Serious infections were <4%.These data reflect the early U.S. experience with vedolizumab.

Mice were injected intraperitoneally with different doses of MMI-0100 (0. and 1 mg/kg per day, six days). The physiological indexes, the parameters for colonic pathological injury and the intensity of inflammatory responses were evaluated by histological staining, quantitative PCR, western blotting, and immunostaining. MMI-0100 attenuated DSS-induced body weight loss, colon length shortening, and colonic pathological injury, including decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration. MMI-0100 suppressed DSS-induced activation of CD11b and F4/80 positive cell, and dramatically decreased the expression of a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, TGF- β, IFN-γ, IL-17A, COX-2 and iNOS. A TUNEL assay showed that MMI-0100 protected against DSS-induced apoptosis. This is consistent with the results of Western blotting assay in apoptosis-related proteins including Bcl-2, BAX, caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of MMI-0100 on DSS-induced colitis were achieved by down-regulating the phosphorylation level of MK2, IκBα and p65 protein.

Among 122 eligible inflammatory bowel disease () patients, 65 met the inclusion criteria. Combined EN and PN was administered for 21 days, wherein over the first 3- days of treatment, trophic enteral nutrition (300 kcal/day) was used with an energy increase of up to 1500 kcal. An EN was administered using a nasogastric tube or, in case of intolerance, using a naso-jejunal tube. For PN, the "All in One" system was used according to individually prepared admixtures (ESPEN Guidelines). In addition to routine blood measurement (i.e., ALAT, ASPAT, GGTP, creatinine, lipid profile), the following parameters were assessed: adiponectin, leptin, (hs)TNF-α, hsIL-6 and hsIL-10, TSH, NT-proBNP, serum vitamin B12 concentration, and tHcy. The results showed a considerable improvement in all clinically significant parameters ( < 0.05), showing the benefits and importance of short-term well-balanced EN combined with PN for nutritional and clinical status in  patients with active disease.

However, the impact of recreational marijuana usage on in-hospital outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease () remains indistinct. We assessed the outcomes of Crohn's disease (CD) as well as ulcerative colitis (UC) with  without recreational marijuana usage using a nationally illustrative propensity-matched sample.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample datasets (2010-2014) were queried to identify adults with CD and UC hospitalizations with cannabis use and linked complications using ICD-9 CM codes. Categorical and continuous variables were compared between propensity-matched cohorts using Chi-square and Student's -test, respectively. Primary endpoints were in-hospital complications, whereas secondary endpoints were the discharge disposition, mean length of stay (LOS) and hospital charges.Propensity-matched cohorts included 6,002 CD (2,999 cannabis users & 3,003 non-users) and 1,481 UC (742 cannabis users & 739 non-users) hospitalizations. In CD patients, prevalence of colorectal cancer (0.3%  1.2%, P<0.001), need for parenteral nutrition (3.0%  4.7%, P=0.001) and anemia (25.6%  30.1%, P<0.001) were lower in cannabis users. However, active fistulizing disease or intraabdominal abscess formation (8.6%  .9%, P<0.001), unspecific lower gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage (4.0%  2.7%, P=0.004) and hypovolemia (1.2%  0.%, P=0.004) were higher with recreational cannabis use. The mean hospital stay was shorter (4.2  .0 days) with less hospital charges ($28,956  $35,180, P<0.001) in cannabis users. In patients with UC, cannabis users faced the higher frequency of fluid and electrolyte disorders (45.1%  29.6%, P<0.001), and hypovolemia (2.7%  <11) with relatively lower frequency of postoperative infections (<11  3.4%, P=0.010). No other complications were significant enough for comparison between the cannabis users and non-users in this group. Like CD, UC-cannabis patients had shorter mean hospital stay (LOS) (4.3  .7 days, P<0.001) and faced less financial burden ($30,393  $41,308, P<0.001).We found a lower frequency of colorectal cancer, parenteral nutrition, anemia but a higher occurrences of active fistulizing disease or intraabdominal abscess formation, lower GI hemorrhage and hypovolemia in the CD cohort with cannabis usage.

Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) death resulting from innate immune activation, termed pyroptosis, was recently found to be a cause of this barrier defect. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of pretreatment ileal biopsy pyroptosis as a biomarker for clinical response to vedolizumab in CD.Crohn's disease patients ranging 18 to 80 years old from   centers with pre-vedolizumab ileal biopsies during colonoscopy were enrolled. Biopsies were stained for activated caspases, and levels of ileal IEC pyroptosis levels were quantified. The primary outcome was clinical response 6 months after therapy, defined as a reduction of Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) of ≥ points from baseline. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, defined as HBI <, and endoscopic improvement, as measured by the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD).One hundred CD patients (45 male, 55 female), median age 47 (19, 78) years, were included; clinical response rate was 60%, and clinical remission was 36%. The response rate in patients with ileal pyroptosis <14 positive cells per 1000 IECs was significantly higher than those above the threshold: 89% (25 of 28) vs 49% (35 of 72), odds ratio (OR) 8.8 (95% CI, 2.3-48.6; P < 0.001). Corresponding remission rates were 54% (15 of 28) vs 29% (21 of 72; OR 2.8 [1.03-7.59; P = 0.036]). For endoscopic improvement, ileal pyroptosis of 22 positive cells per 1000 IECs was the optimal threshold that determines the magnitude SES-CD change.Ileal biopsy IEC pyroptosis was predictive of clinical response and endoscopic improvement to vedolizmab in CD patients.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

We utilized the latest available country-specific incidence rates, and aggregate data for 20 determinants, from over 50 countries accounting for more than half of the global population. We presented the associations with exponentiated beta coefficients [exp(β)] indicating the relative increase of disease incidence per unit increase in the predictor variables.Country-specific incidence estimates demonstrate wide variability across the world, with a median of 4.8 new UC cases (IQR 2.4-9.3), and 3. new CD cases (IQR 0.8-.7) per 100,000 population per year. Latitude [exp(β) 1.05, 95% CI 1.04‒1.06, per degree increase], prevalence of obesity (1.05, 1.02‒1.07, per 1% increase) and of tobacco smoking (0.97, 0.95‒0.99, per 1% increase) explained 71.% of UC incidence variation across countries in the adjusted analysis. The model for CD included latitude (1.04, 1.02‒1.06), expenditure for health (1.03, 1.01‒1.05, per 100 PPP/year per capita increase) and physical inactivity prevalence (1.03, 1.00‒1.06, per 1% increase) explaining 58.3% of incidence variation across countries.

We developed statements through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on them.The consensus includes 25 statements focused on medical treatment options. Consensus was not reached, and no recommendations were made, for 14 additional statements, largely due to lack of evidence. The group suggested corticosteroid therapies (including budesonide for mild to moderate disease). The group suggested exclusive enteral nutrition for induction therapy and biologic tumor necrosis factor antagonists for induction and maintenance therapy at diagnosis or at early stages of severe disease, and for patients failed by steroid and immunosuppressant induction therapies. The group recommended against the use of oral -aminosalicylate for induction or maintenance therapy in patients with moderate disease, and recommended against thiopurines for induction therapy, corticosteroids for maintenance therapy, and cannabis in any role. The group was unable to clearly define the role of concomitant immunosuppressants during initiation therapy with a biologic agent, although thiopurine combinations are not recommended for male patients. No consensus was reached on the role of aminosalicylates in treatment of patients with mild disease, antibiotics or vedolizumab for induction or maintenance therapy, or methotrexate for induction therapy. Patients in clinical remission who are receiving immunomodulators should be assessed for mucosal healing within 1 year of treatment initiation.Evidence-based medical treatment of Crohn's disease in children is recommended, with thorough ongoing assessments to define treatment success.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology.

The incidence of type 2 diabetes, traditionally viewed as an adult disease, is increasing at alarming rates in children, paralleling the rise in childhood obesity. As the rates of diabetes increase in children, accurate population-based assessment of disease burden is important for those implementing strategies for health services delivery. Health administrative data are a powerful tool that can be used to track disease burden, health services use, and health outcomes. Case validation is essential in ensuring accurate disease identification using administrative databases.The aim of our study was to define and validate a pediatric diabetes case ascertainment algorithm (including any form of childhood-onset diabetes) using health administrative data.We conducted a two-stage method using linked health administrative data and data extracted from charts. In stage 1, we linked chart data from a large urban region to health administrative data and compared the diagnostic accuracy of various algorithms. We selected those that performed the best to be validated in stage 2. In stage 2, the most accurate algorithms were validated with chart data within two other geographic areas in the province of Quebec.Accurate identification of diabetes in children (ages ≤15 years) required four physician claims or one hospitalization (with International Classification of Disease codes within 1 year (sensitivity 91.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 89.2-92.9]; positive predictive value [PPV] 93.%, 95% CI 91.7-95.0) or using only four physician claims in 2 years (sensitivity 90.4%, 95% CI 88.3-92.2; PPV 93.2%, 95% CI 91.7-95.0).

The clinical course of CD is characterized by periods of symptomatic relapse and remission. Clinical variables may identify a subset of patients with CD at risk for relapse. Identifying these patients, and early stratification-based treatment would be of utmost clinical importance in optimizing the management and is likely to improve long-term disease outcome. In pediatric-onset  there is a paucity of data for predicting clinical behavior and results are conflicting. With this background, we hypothesized that routinely measured clinical variables at the time of diagnosis would predict relapse in patients with CD, and sought to investigate the clinical predictors of relapse present at the time of diagnosis in our patient population. We further compared differences in clinical variables and laboratory values for patients who relapsed early, compared with those who relapsed late. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with CD by clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological criteria at St. John Providence Children's Hospital pediatric GI clinic between 01/2006 and 12/2014. Patients were followed until they had their first relapse or for three years from diagnosis, whichever was earlier. Variables studied included demographic factors (age, gender, race, BMI, BMI percentiles and family history of ), presenting symptoms (blood in stools, nocturnal stools, fever, and extra-intestinal manifestations), phenotypic characteristics (using Montreal classification), and laboratory data [white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP)]. Results Twenty-nine patients were included in the study. One was lost to follow up, and 28 were included in the analyses. The relapse rate was 50% at three years, and 32% patients relapsed within one year of diagnosis. Low BMI percentile at diagnosis (41. ± 28.8 vs. 18.0 ± 20.3; p-value 0.03) was a predictor of relapse. Comparing early relapse to those who relapsed late, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Conclusions Low BMI percentile at presentation was associated with increased risk of relapse, suggesting that routinely measured clinical variables may have role in predicting first relapse in this patient population. There was no significant difference in the variable comparing patients who relapsed early vs. those who relapsed late. Future prospective studies with larger sample sizes need to be done to predict relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503216>Improving Post-Induction Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Adequate serum drug levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (anti-TNF) have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (). We aim to describe the quality improvement (QI) methods used at our institution to improve post-induction therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in children initiating anti-TNF therapy (infliximab and adalimumab) and describe the frequency of subtherapeutic anti-TNF levels.Beginning in February 2016, all patients initiating anti-TNF therapy were identified and tracked. Interventions to improve TDM, including the initiation of therapy plans for infliximab, real-time reminders for practitioners, and scheduling modifications for those initiating anti-TNF therapies were implemented using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle approach. Statistical process control charts were used to demonstrate improvement over time. Anti-TNF levels and presence of anti-drug antibodies were also recorded.Using QI methodology, we improved post-induction anti-TNF TDM from a baseline of 43% in 2015 to > 80% by the end of 2017, with sustained improvement. Infliximab post-induction TDM improved from a baseline of 59% to 82% while adalimumab post-induction TDM improved from baseline of 14% to 79%. In total, 36% of all anti-TNF post-induction levels were less than  μg/mL, with nearly 60% of post-induction infliximab levels being less than  μg/mL.Through incremental QI approaches, we improved the utilization of anti-TNF post-induction TDM with sustained improvement, approaching our goal of 90%. Subtherapeutic post-induction infliximab levels were common, indicating a strong need for anti-TNF TDM and an opportunity for dose optimization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365486>Time-to-reach Target Calprotectin Level in Newly Diagnosed Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Treatment targets in inflammatory bowel disease () move away from controlling symptoms towards complete recovery of the intestinal mucosa. Currently, the most frequently used noninvasive surrogate marker of mucosal healing is a faecal calprotectin concentration in the target range. This study tested if there was a relation between time-to-reach target calprotectin and first flare.We prospectively included new-onset  patients ages 17 and younger in a cloud-based registry (FastForwardCare) and followed them for at least 52 weeks. They were treated according to Dutch national guidelines that advocate a step-up approach. Time-to-reach target was defined as the first calprotectin measurement below 250 μg/g after the start of induction therapy. Time-to-first flare was the time from the first calprotectin measurement below 250 μg/g until reappearance of symptoms with calprotectin values above 250 μg/g.We included 76 patients (luminal Crohn disease [CD] 43); ulcerative colitis [UC] 33). Median age at diagnosis was, respectively 14. and 14.1 years. Median time-to-reach target calprotectin was 37 weeks in CD and 11 weeks in UC patients (Log-rank test, P = 0.001). Once the calprotectin target was reached, time-to-first flare was significantly longer in CD than in UC patients (Log-rank test, P = 0.001). CD patients with time-to-reach target calprotectin ≤12 weeks after conventional induction therapy (ie, exclusive enteral nutrition or steroids) had a more favorable disease course in the first year than those with time-to-reach target calprotectin >12 weeks (Log-rank test, P = 0.057). In UC patients, time-to-reach target calprotectin ≤12 weeks is not associated with a favorable disease course in the first year.The findings of this prospective registry suggest that a quick response to conventional therapy predicts a favorable disease course in new-onset paediatric CD, but not in UC. The concept "time-to-reach target calprotectin level" rationalizes the indefinite term "response to treatment" and is well suited for studying treatment effectiveness in real-world practices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467592>What forecasting the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease may tell us about its evolution on a national scale.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is increasingly prevalent within western societies.

The impact of VEDO within 12 weeks preoperatively on postoperative morbidity was initially assessed with univariate and multivariable analyses on all patients. A case-matched analysis was then carried out comparing patients exposed to VEDO vs. other biologic agents based on gender, age ±  years, diagnosis, date of surgery ± 2 years, and surgical procedure.Out of 980 patients, 141 received VEDO. The majority of patients (59%) underwent surgery involving end or diverting ostomy creation. The initial multivariate analysis conducted on all patients indicated that VEDO use was independently associated with increased overall morbidity (p<0.001), but not infectious morbidity (p=0.30). However, the case-matched comparison of 95 VEDO-treated patients vs. 95 patients treated with adalimumab or infliximab did not indicate any difference in overall morbidity (p=0.32), infectious complications (p=0.15), or surgical site infections (p=0.12).In a study population having a high rate of surgery involving ostomy creation, the exposure to preoperative VEDO was not associated with an increased morbidity rate when compared with other biologics.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of European CrohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) 2019.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for nonadherence.This was a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with  treated at a tertiary care center and prescribed self-injectable biologic therapy using the center's specialty pharmacy. Adherence was defined using medication possession ratio (MPR). Nonadherence was defined as MPR <0.86.Four hundred sixty patients (n = 393 with CD and n = 67 with UC) were evaluated with mean MPR (interquartile range) equaling 0.89 (0.48-1). Overall, 69% of patients were adherent (defined as MPR ≥0.86), 66% of patients with CD and 87% of patients with UC. In univariate analysis, several factors increased risk of nonadherence: CD diagnosis, insurance type, psychiatric history, smoking, prior biologic use, and narcotic use (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], .; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-15.6) and CD diagnosis (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0) increased risk of nonadherence. In CD, as the number of risk factors increased (narcotic use, psychiatric history, prior biologic use, and smoking), the probability of nonadherence increased. Adherence was 72% in patients with 0-1 risk factors, decreasing to 62%, 61%, and 42% in patients with 2, 3, and 4 risk factors, respectively (P < 0.05).This study identified risk factors for nonadherence to biologic therapy.

Defects in such mechanisms can favour the development of chronic intestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the principal forms of inflammatory bowel diseases () in humans, as well as systemic disorders. Over the last years, the frequency of intestinal and systemic immune-inflammatory disorders has increased in previously low incidence areas, likely due to the Westernization of lifestyles, including dietary habits. The Western diet is characterized by high consumption of proteins, saturated fats and sweets, as well as by a broad use of food additives (e.g., emulsifiers, bulking agents), which are used to preserve and enhance food quality. Accumulating evidence suggests that food additives can perturb gut homeostasis, thereby contributing to promote tissue-damaging inflammatory responses. For instance, mice given the emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate 80 develop dysbiosis with overgrowth of mucus-degrading bacteria. Such an effect triggers colitis in animals deficient in either interleukin-10, a cytokine exerting anti-inflammatory and regulatory functions, or Toll-like receptor , a receptor recognizing the bacterial flagellin. Similarly, the polysaccharide maltodextrin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress in intestinal goblet cells, thereby impairing mucus release and increasing host susceptibility to colitis. In this review, we report and discuss the current knowledge about the impact of food additives on gut homeostasis and their potential contribution to the development of inflammatory disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633186>Excisional Hemorrhoidectomy: Safe in Patients With Crohn's Disease?</a></h2><p>Due to concerns over wound healing, hemorrhoidectomy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) remains controversial. We sought to ascertain safety and efficacy of excisional hemorrhoidectomy in CD.A retrospective review of all adult CD patients undergoing excisional hemorrhoidectomy between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 2019, at 2  referral centers was performed. Data collected included patient demographics, clinical characteristics of CD (anorectal symptoms; prior nonoperative hemorrhoidal therapy; presence of other perianal disease; and activity, duration, and anatomic location of CD), and postoperative complications including bleeding, wound healing, and need for further therapy or surgical intervention after surgery.A total of 36 adult patients with Crohn's disease with symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease were included. The study cohort included 16 males (44%), and median age was 49 (range, 21 to 77) years. Predominant symptoms included pain (n = 16; 44%), prolapse (n = 8; 22%), and bleeding (n = 12; 33%). Sixteen patients (44%) had nonoperative therapy before surgery. Twenty-four patients (67%) had other perianal disease. At the time of hemorrhoidectomy, 9 patients (25%) were exposed to corticosteroids, 8 patients (25%) to immunomodulators, and 9 patients (25%) to biologics. During a median follow-up time of 31. (range, 1 to 255) months after hemorrhoidectomy, 4 patients (11%) had complications (1 developed a stricture, 1 developed a perianal abscess/fistula, 1 had a nonhealing wound, and 1 had hemorrhoidal recurrence).Our data suggest that excisional hemorrhoidectomy may be performed safely in CD patients who have failed nonoperative hemorrhoidal therapy without concern for de novo perianal disease or need for proctectomy.Hemorrhoidal disease is common in patients with Crohn's disease.

The current treatment paradigm for  is focused on suppression of the immune system. However, intestinal microbiota transplant (IMT) may present an avenue to treat  by altering the target of inflammation without necessitating immune suppression. Presently, reports of the greatest success with IMT in  have been with ulcerative colitis (UC). Four randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of IMT in UC and reported a pooled rate of combined clinical and endoscopic remission of 28% (95% CI: 4-10). For clinical remission alone, the pooled rate was as high as 42% with a number needed to treat of  (95% CI: 3-17). While promising, many questions remain which include elucidating the optimal microbiota enrichment, exacting donor profiling, and identifying the optimal IMT route and frequency. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the ability to achieve stable engraftment for maintenance of remission as well as safety of IMT therapeutics.

A melatonin production independent of the photoperiod is typical of the gut. However, the local physiological role of melatonin at the intestinal tract is poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory activities of melatonin in an in vitro model of inflamed intestinal epithelium. To this purpose, we assessed different parameters usually associated with intestinal inflammation using IL-1β-stimulated Caco-2 cells. Differentiated monolayers of Caco-2 cells were preincubated with melatonin (1 nmol/L-50 μmol/L) and then exposed to IL-1β. After each treatment, different inflammatory mediators, DNA-breakage, and global DNA methylation status were assayed. To evaluate the involvement of melatonin membrane receptors, we also exposed differentiated monolayers to melatonin in the presence of luzindole, a MT1 and MT2 antagonist. Our results showed that melatonin, at concentrations similar to those obtained in the lumen gut after ingestion of dietary supplements for the treatment of sleep disorders, was able to attenuate the inflammatory response induced by IL-1β. Anti-inflammatory effects were expressed as both a decrease of the levels of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and NO, and a reduced increase in paracellular permeability. Moreover, the protection was associated with a reduced NF-κB activation and a prevention of DNA demethylation. Conversely, luzindole did not reverse the melatonin inhibition of stimulated-IL-6 release. In conclusion, our findings suggest that melatonin, through a local action, can modulate inflammatory processes at the intestinal level, offering new opportunities for a multimodal management of .© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Asymptomatic patients with a Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) symptom sub-score of zero who underwent an index surveillance pouchoscopy were included. Endoscopic pouch body activity was graded as 0: normal, 1: mucosal inflammation, or 2: mucosal breaks (ulcers and/or erosions). The primary outcome was primary acute idiopathic pouchitis defined as PDAI score ≥ 7 with symptoms lasting less than four weeks and responsive to standard antibiotics, not otherwise meeting criteria for secondary pouchitis. The secondary outcome was chronic idiopathic pouchitis defined as PDAI score ≥ 7 with symptoms lasting greater than four weeks despite standard antibiotics. Predictors of pouchitis were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) reported.143 asymptomatic pouch patients were included. Index endoscopic pouch body activity was 0 in 86 (60.1%) patients, 1 in 26 (18.2%) and 2 in 31 (21.7%). The median length of follow-up after index surveillance pouchoscopy was 3.03 [IQR 1.24-4.60] years. Primary acute idiopathic pouchitis occurred in 44 (31%) patients and chronic idiopathic pouchitis in 12 (8.4%). Grade 2 endoscopic pouch activity was associated with the development of acute pouchitis (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.23-4.67), although not chronic pouchitis (HR 1.76, 95% CI 0.53-.87). Histologic inflammation in endoscopically normal pouch mucosa was not associated with acute or chronic pouchitis.Mucosal breaks are present in nearly a quarter of asymptomatic patients with IPAA and are associated with an increased risk of acute pouchitis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622538>Fecal microbiota transplantation results in bacterial strain displacement in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h2><p>Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which is thought to have the potential to correct dysbiosis of gut microbiota, has been used to treat inflammatory bowel disease () for almost a decade. Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in  patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from  individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Clinical parameters and colonoscopy are used to establish the criteria for controlled or non-controlled disease and subsequent definition of treatment. Our objective in the present study was to compare the area of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in patients with a diagnosis of  during remission and active disease.144 eyes of 72 patients with  were evaluated via a complete ophthalmological exam. Fundus photography and optical coherence tomography/angiography (OCT/OCTA) were performed with a Topcon Triton. The macula and posterior pole were evaluated by binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy and fundus biomicroscopy. The area of the FAZ was determined via manual delimitation of superficial retinal vascular layers from OCTA with image6.net software. To establish disease activity, we considered the Mayo Score, fecal calprotectin levels, colonoscopy results and clinical parameters. All retinal parameters were evaluated in a blinded manner. Means were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney test.The participants had a mean age of 42.26 years and included 28 males (38.88%) and 44 females (61.11%). Among the participants, 37 had a diagnosis of CD (51.38%), and 35 had a diagnosis of UC (48.61%). Twenty-five patients (34.72%) had active disease, and 47 (65.27%) were in remission. The area of the FAZ did not differ significantly between the CD and UC groups ( = 0.91 for the right eye and  = 0.76 for the left eye) but did differ significantly between the remission and active disease groups ( = 0.01 for the right eye and  = 0.02 for the left eye).Our study is the first to evaluate the area of the FAZ in patients with  via swept-source OCTA. The area of the FAZ did not differ significantly in either eye between the CD and UC groups. However, patients classified as having active disease according to clinical parameters and colonoscopy presented a significant decrease in the area of the FAZ compared with patients in remission. The area of the FAZ is an ophthalmological parameter that can be obtained non-invasively and is increased in ischemic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. The FAZ may decrease due to vascular engorgement or increased systemic inflammation. This parameter can be used to help determine whether a patient is in remission or active , thus potentially reducing the need for invasive exams during disease follow-up.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613652>Marked regional variations in the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in a limited geographical region are not associated with compounds in the drinking water.</a></h2><p> The incidence of autoimmune diseases, especially inflammatory bowel disease (), has increased substantially.

Water analyses for pH, alkaline, nitrate, sulphate, iron, magnesium and calcium were based on established methods and compared with the prevalence of  using Student's -test.  A total number of 8925 patients were identified. The incidence for CD and UC were high (mean 16.4/10, range 13.6-17.9 and 25.3/10, range 21.3-28.0, respectively). The prevalence varied substantially ( < .0001 for both; CD mean 0.30%, range 0.15-0.42 and UC mean 0.42%, range 0.32-0.56). No correlation between  and the chemical compounds in the drinking water could be shown.  The incidence rates of both CD and UC were high. The prevalence varied from 200% to 300% between the municipalities, despite the limited geographical area indicating that local conditions are of importance.

While informed patients with chronic illness have improved adherence and outcomes, previous research showed that the majority of  patients receive insufficient information regarding their disease. The large heterogeneity of  and the wide range of information topics makes a one-size fits all knowledge resource overwhelming and cumbersome. We hypothesized that different patient profiles may have different and specific information needs, the identification of which will allow building personalized computer-based information resources in the future.To evaluate the scope of disease-related knowledge among  patients and determine whether different patient profiles drive unique information needs.We conducted a nationwide survey addressing hospital-based  clinics. A Total of 571 patients completed a 28-item questionnaire, rating the amount of information received at time of diagnosis and the importance of information, as perceived by participants, for a newly diagnosed patient, and for the participants themselves, at current time. We performed an exploratory factor analysis of the crude responses aiming to create a number of representative knowledge domains (factors), and analyzed the responses of a set of 15 real-life patient profiles generated by the study team.Participants gave low ratings for the amount of information received at disease onset (averaging 0.9/) and high ratings for importance, both for the newly diagnosed patients (mean 4.2/) and for the participants themselves at current time (mean 3./). Factor analysis grouped responses into six information-domains. The responses of selected profiles, compared with the rest of the participants, yielded significant associations (defined as a difference in rating of > 0. points with a  < 0.05). Patients with active disease showed a higher interest in work-disability, stress-coping, and therapy-complications. Patients newly diagnosed at age > 50, and patients with long-standing disease (> 10 years) showed less interest in work-disability. Patients in remission with mesalamine or no therapy showed less interest in all domains except for nutrition and long-term complications.We demonstrate unmet patient information needs.

Relatively little is known about the α4β7-integrin (α4β7) expression of different T-cell subsets in different anatomical compartments of healthy individuals, patients with HIV or inflammatory bowel disease (). Surface expression of α4β7 as well as the frequency of activation, homing and exhaustion markers of T cells were assessed by multicolour flow cytometry in healthy volunteers (n = 15) compared to HIV infected patients (n = 52) or patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 14), 6 of whom treated with vedolizumab. In addition, lymph nodal cells (n = 6), gut-derived cells of healthy volunteers (n = ) and patients with UC (n = 6) were analysed. Additionally, we studied longitudinal PBMC samples of an HIV patient who was treated with vedolizumab for concomitant UC. Overall, only minor variations of the frequency of α4β7 on total CD4+ T cells were detectable regardless of the disease status or (VDZ) treatment status in peripheral blood and the studied tissues. Peripheral α4β7+ CD4+ T cells of healthy individuals and patients with UC showed a higher activation status and were more frequently CCR5+ than their α4β7- counterparts. Also, the frequency of α4β7+ cells was significantly lower in peripheral blood CD4+ effector memory T cells of HIV-infected compared to healthy individuals and this reduced frequency did not recover in HIV patients on ART. Conversely, the frequency of peripheral blood naïve α4β7+ CD4+ T cells was significantly reduced under VDZ treatment.

The two major forms are Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Crohn disease can involve the entire gastrointestinal tract and the full thickness of the bowel wall. UC is confined to the mucosal layer of the colon. Steroids are used mainly for management of moderate to severely active (ie, acute flares of) . However, steroid use should be limited to the short term because of adverse effects related to long-term usage. Methotrexate is useful for induction and maintenance treatment of Crohn disease. (This is an off-label use of methotrexate.) -Aminosalicylates are effective for UC management. Surgery theoretically is curative for UC but is a last resort intervention for Crohn disease.

Intestinal permeability was assessed by FITC-Dextran assay.Both high- and low-dose EGCG treatment alleviated clinical manifestations including body weight loss and disease activity index (DAI) of DSS-induced colitis. The DAI score was significantly improved after two days of EGCG treatment. At the end of the study, the macroscopic severity score (MSS) of HE and LE treatment groups were 2.4 ± 1.2, and 2.2 ± 1.0, respectively, significantly lower than that of the controls (.0 ± 2.1). EGCG treatment also prevented colon shortening, and improved intestinal permeability and histopathological changes. In addition, EGCG treatment attenuated colon inflammation by suppressing colonic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-alpha, and inhibited CD3+ T cell and CD68+ macrophage infiltration.EGCG is effective in inflammatory colitis because it reduces cellular and molecular inflammation, and reduces intestinal permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587371>Evaluation of a fluorescent immunochromatography test for fecal calprotectin.</a></h2><p>Fecal calprotectin (FC) is widely used to discriminate between patients with inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease () and functional diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). ELISA is a time-consuming method for the measurement of FC, whereas a fluorescent immunochromatography test can obtain results in around 30 minutes and thus enables a rapid response to clinical decision.Two methods, the Proglead calprotectin (FC Proglead) and the BÜHLMANN fCAL ELISA (FC BÜHLMANN), were used to quantitatively examine FC in 111 stool samples. The comparison and bias estimation of both assays were assessed using CLSI EP09c protocol.The two methods were highly correlated (rho = .96). Deming regression was employed to calculate the regression equation, with a slope of 1.01 and an intercept of -4.98 μg/g. The estimated median bias (FC Proglead - FC BÜHLMANN) was -4.19 μg/g with the 95% limits of agreement (-55.59 to 47.21 μg/g), and the estimated median percent bias was -8.71% with the 95% limits of agreement (-50.31% to 32.90%). There was 4.50% (/111) of values outside the 95% limits of agreement. Percent biases at the FC cutoff values of 50 and 200 μg/g between both methods evaluated by Deming regression were 8.96% and 1.49%, respectively. The biases were all less than the acceptable standard (10%).

The  waiting times were correlated to disease complications (e.g. >% weight loss, abscess formation) and additional health care consumption (e.g. (telephone)outpatient clinic appointment, hospital admission) during these waiting times.The mean waiting was 10 weeks (SD 8) for patients with active disease (n=173) and 15 weeks (SD 16) for those with inactive disease (n=97), remarkably higher compared to colorectal cancer patients ( weeks). While awaiting surgery, 1 out of 8 patients had to undergo surgery in an (semi-)acute setting. Additionally, 19% of patients with active disease had disease complications, and 44% needed additional health care. The rates were comparable for patients with inactive disease.The current waiting time to surgery is not medically justified and creates a burden for health care resources.

In these patients, the over-production of ROS generated by inflamed bowel tissue and inflammatory cells activates a pathogenic cascade that further exacerbates inflammation and leads to increased oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. We measured the products of protein/lipid oxidation and the total antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing ability of plasma, FRAP) in the serum of CD patients with severe disease activity requiring surgery with the aim to characterize their redox status and identify associations between oxidative stress-related markers and their clinical characteristics. At the systemic level, CD was associated with increased levels of protein and lipid oxidation products when compared to healthy volunteers, even though the FRAP values were similar. Advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) levels showed the highest difference between patients and the controls (11.25, .02-15.15, vs. 1.36, 0.75-2.70, median, interquartile range;  < 0.0001) and the analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, indicated for AOPP, the best area under the curve (AUC) value for CD prediction. Advanced glycated end-products (AGEs) were also significantly higher in CD patients ( < 0.01), which is of interest since AOPP and AGEs are both able to activate the membrane receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) involved in inflammatory diseases. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels were significantly higher in CD patients with ileal localization and aggressive disease behavior, in smokers, and in patients suffering from allergies. In conclusion, our data indicate that circulating oxidative stress biomarkers may be attractive candidates as disease predictors as well as for clinical or therapeutic monitoring of CD. Our results also suggest that AOPP/AGEs and RAGE signaling may represent a pathogenic factor and a potential therapeutic target in CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31442399>Therapeutic Opportunities in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Mechanistic Dissection of Host-Microbiome Relationships.</a></h2><p>The current understanding of inflammatory bowel disease () pathogenesis implicates a complex interaction between host genetics, host immunity, microbiome, and environmental exposures.

All cases were reviewed for clinical profile, inflammatory bowel disease () co-morbidity and major endpoints like death, cholangiocarcinoma and liver transplantation (LT).We identified 28 (18 men) patients with PSC (19, 67% large-duct and 9, 33% small-duct) with a median age of 31. years (range 7-63 years) with median duration of follow up of 24 months (6-125 months). Six (21.4%) had autoimmune hepatitis (AIH-PSC) overlap. Inflammatory bowel disease was seen in 12 (43%) cases, all were ulcerative colitis (UC). During follow up, seven patients (25%) developed dominant stricture or recurrent cholangitis, 11 (39%) had  portal hypertension, 2 (7%) developed cholangiocarcinoma and  (17.8%) progressed to hepatic  decompensation on follow up. Ten (35%) patients died,  from liver-related complications, 2 from cholangiocarcinoma, 1 each from brain hemorrhage and systemic sepsis and 1 due to unknown cause; 3 underwent liver transplantation. Revised Mayo score of patients who survived was lower than those who died (1.03 vs. 1.86, p value 0.03).PSC commonly presents in young age and rapidly progresses to decompensation. Prevalence of  in PSC is lower and the proportion of small-duct PSC is higher than that observed in western populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568016>The risk of venous thromboembolism in women with inflammatory bowel disease during pregnancy and the postpartum period: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Pregnancy and inflammatory bowel disease () are independent risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Nevertheless, the optimal VTE prevention strategy for women with  in pregnancy and postpartum period has not been established yet. We assessed VTE risks during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with  through systematic review and meta-analysis.Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CENTRAL (Ovid), and Web of Science (Tomson Reuters) from the database inception till May 2017 to identify relevant studies reporting the risk of VTE during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period in women with . Random effect meta-analyses were performed to compare VTE-related outcomes between women with  and without . Our protocol was registered: CRD 42017060199 in the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews.In the analysis of  studies reviewed,  population (n = 17,636) had a significantly increased risk of VTE during pregnancy (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66-2.73) and postpartum (RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.84-3.69), comparing to the non- population (n = 11,251,778). According to the location of VTE, the risk of deep vein thrombosis increased significantly by RR of 2.74 (95% CI 1.73-4.36) during pregnancy, whilst risk increase of pulmonary embolism was not statistically significant. In the subgroup analysis, the degree of VTE risk was higher in both periods in the UC group than in the CD group, as compared to that in the non- population (UC group, during pregnancy: RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.6-3.11; postpartum period: RR 2.85, 95% CI 1.79-4.52).Significantly increased risks of VTE during pregnancy were found in the women with , according to the periods and type of , which might support a detailed strategy regarding administration of prophylactic anticoagulants to women with .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450748>Towards the Oral Treatment of Ileo-Colonic Inflammatory Bowel Disease with Infliximab Tablets: Development and Validation of the Production Process.</a></h2><p>Infliximab (IFX) is an intravenously administered monoclonal antibody antagonizing the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) systemically and is efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (). However, studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects result from local immunomodulation in the inflamed regions. Furthermore, topical inhibition of TNF in  ameliorates inflammation. We therefore hypothesized that orally administered IFX targeted to the ileo-colonic region in  may be an efficacious new treatment option. This study describes the development and validation of the production process of ileo-colonic-targeted  mg IFX tablets (ColoPulse-IFX) intended for the oral treatment of  by means of producing three consecutive validation batches (VAL1, VAL2, and VAL3, respectively). UV-VIS spectroscopy, HPLC-SEC analysis (content, fragments, aggregates), fluorescence spectroscopy (tertiary protein structure), and ELISA (potency) showed no noticeable deviations of IFX compounded to ColoPulse-IFX compared to fresh IFX stock. The average ± SD ( = 10) IFX content of VAL1, VAL2, and VAL3 was 96 ± 2%, 97 ± 3%, and 96 ± 2%, respectively, and complied with the European Pharmacopeia (Ph. Eur.) requirements for Content Uniformity. The average ± SD ( = 3) ColoPulse-IFX potency was 105 ± 4%, 96 ± 4%, and 97 ± %, respectively, compared to fresh IFX stock. The IFX release profile from the tablet core was complete (≥85%) after 10 min in simulated ileum medium. The in vitro coating performance of ColoPulse-IFX showed that the formulation was targeted to the simulated ileo-colonic region. Stability data showed that ColoPulse-IFX was stable for up to 6 months stored at 25 °C/60% RH. Based on these results, the production process can be considered validated and its application is discussed in light of the rationale and available evidence for the topical treatment of  with IFX.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31324279>Revisit gut microbiota and its impact on human health and disease.</a></h2><p>Trillions of microbes have evolved with and continue to live on human beings.

If the distal end of the fistula extended more than 4 cm from the anal orifice, the skin and subcutaneous tissue were dissected along the outer edge of the anal sphincter to divide the fistulous tract into two portions. One seton encircled the sphincter from the primary opening throughout the anal canal (medial seton), and the other was inserted through the distal tract outside the sphincter (lateral seton). A BIO was then introduced immediately. When discharge ceased, the Penrose tube or vessel loop was replaced sequentially with a rubber band, which was tied fittingly and subsequently removed in medial to lateral order.The mean interval between fistula onset and CD diagnosis was 2.1 years, and that between CD diagnosis and introduction of BIOs was 0. years. The mean follow-up duration was 4 years. The BIOs currently used were infliximab in 10 patients, adalimumab in 7, and ustekinumab in 1. The overall success rate was 94.4%, including unproductive fistulas in 10 (55.6%) patients and fistula disappearance in 7 (38.9%).Our seton drainage techniques via the "top-down" approach represent a promising avenue for treating perianal fistulas in patients with CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622979>The ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Inflammatory Bowel Disease Collaborative: Design, Implementation, and Validation of a Disease-specific Module.</a></h2><p>Surgery for inflammatory bowel disease () involves a complex interplay between disease, surgery, and medications, exposing patients to increased risk of postoperative complications. Surgical best practices have been largely based on single-institution results and meta-analyses, with multicenter clinical data lacking. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) has revolutionized the way in which large-volume surgical outcomes data have been collected. Our aim was to employ the ACS-NSQIP to collect disease-specific variables relevant to surgical outcomes in .A collaborative of 13 high-volume  surgery centers was convened to collect  -specific variables in NSQIP. Variables included biologic and immunomodulator medications usage, ileostomy utilization, ileal pouch anastomotic technique, and colonic dysplasia/neoplasia. A sample of the Surgical Clinical Reviewer collected data was validated by a colorectal surgeon at each institution, and kappa's agreement statistics generated.Over 1 year, data were collected on a total of 956 cases. Overall, 41.4% of patients had taken a biologic agent in the 60 days before surgery. The 2 most commonly performed procedures were laparoscopic ileocolic resections (159 cases) and subtotal colectomies (151 cases). Overall, 56.8% of cases employed an ileostomy, and 134 ileal pouches were constructed, of which 92.4% used stapled technique. A sample of 214 (22.4%) consecutive cases was validated from 8 institutions. All  novel variables were shown to be reliably collected, with excellent agreement for 4 variables (kappa ≥ 0.70) and very good agreement for the presence of colonic dysplasia (kappa = 0.68).We report the results of the initial year of implementation of the first disease-specific collaborative within NSQIP. The selected variables were demonstrated to be reliably collected, and this collaborative will facilitate high-quality, large case-volume research specific to the  patient population.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

However, the efficiency of a program is influenced by the ability to accurately measure and predict genetic diversity.To examine this question, we conducted a simulation in which common measures (i.e. heterozygosity) and novel measures (identity-by-descent probabilities and parental genomic components) were used to estimate genetic diversity within a conserved population using double-labeled SNP markers.The results showed that the accuracy and sensitivity of identity-by-state (IBS) probabilities and heterozygosity were close to  probabilities, which reflect the true genetic diversity. Expected heterozygosity most closely aligned with . All common measures suggested that practices used in the current Chinese pig conservation program result in a ~% loss in genetic diversity every 10 generations. Parental genomic components were also analyzed to monitor real-time changes in genomic components for each male and female ancestor. The analysis showed that ~7.% of male families and ~30% of female families were lost every  generations. After 50 generations of simulated conservation, 4 male families lost ~50% of their initial genomic components, and the genomic components for 24.8% of the female families were lost entirely.In summary, compared with the true genetic diversity value obtained using double-labeled markers, expected heterozygosity appears to be the optimal indicator.

Fifty-five patients with  in remission or with mild disease activity were randomized to a 6-wk LFD or standard diet (SD). Disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw index [HBi], partial Mayo score), fecal calprotectin, and disease-specific quality of life (-Q) were assessed at baseline and at the end of dietary intervention.After the 6-wk dietary intervention, median HBi decreased in the LFD (4; IQR, 3- versus 3; IQR, 2-3; P = 0.024) but not in the SD (3; IQR, 3-3 versus 3; IQR, 2-4), whereas Mayo scores were numerically decreased in the LFD group and unmodified in the SD group.

The aim of this study was to compare patients with LRBA-related ALPS and LRBA-related CVID, to describe their clinical and laboratory phenotypes, and to prepare an algorithm for their diagnosis and management.Fifteen LRBA-deficient patients were identified among 31 CVID and 14 possible ALPS patients with Western blotting (WB), primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) gene, next-generation panel screening (NGS), and whole exome sequencing (WES).The median age on admission and age of diagnosis were 7 years (0.3-16.) and 11 years (-44), respectively. Splenomegaly was seen in 93.3% (14/15) of the patients on admission. Splenectomy was performed to 1/. Recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (93.3% (14/15)), autoimmune cytopenia (80% (12/15)), chronic diarrhea (53.3% (8/15)), lower respiratory tract infections (53.3% (8/15)), lymphoma (26.6% (4/15)), Evans syndrome (26.6% (4/15)), and autoimmune thyroiditis (20% (3/15)) were common clinical findings and diseases. Lymphopenia (/15), intermittant neutropenia (4/15), eosinophilia (4/15), and progressive hypogammaglobulinemia are recorded in given number of patients. Double negative T cells (TCRαβCD4CD8) were increased in 80% (8/10) of the patients. B cell percentage/numbers were low in 60% (9/15) of the patients on admission. Decreased switched memory B cells, decreased naive and recent thymic emigrant (RTE) Thelper (Th) cells, markedly increased effector memory/effector memory RA (TEMRA) Th were documented. Large PD1 population, increased memory, and enlarged follicular helper T cell population in the CD4 T cell compartment was seen in one of the patients. Most of the deleterious missense mutations were located in the DUF1088 and BEACH domains. Interestingly, one of the two siblings with the same homozygous LRBA defect did not have any clinical symptom. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed to 7/15 (46.6%) of the patients. Transplanted patients are alive and well after a median of 2 years (1-3). In total, one patient died from sepsis during adulthood before HSCT.Patients with LRBA deficiency may initially be diagnosed as CVID or ALPS in the clinical practice. Progressive decrease in B cells as well as IgG in ALPS-like patients and addition of  symptoms in the follow-up should raise the suspicion for LRBA deficiency. Decreased switched memory B cells, decreased naive and recent thymic emigrant (RTE) Th cells, and markedly increased effector memory/effector memory RA Th cells (TEMRA Th) cells are important for the diagnosis of the patients in addition to clinical features. Analysis of protein by either WB or flow cytometry is required when the clinicians come across especially with missense LRBA variants of uncertain significance. High rate of malignancy shows the regulatory T cell's important role of immune surveillance.

Patients with UC usually suffer from a lifetime of debilitating physical symptoms. Therefore, developing effective therapeutic strategy that can manage this disease better and improve patients' life quality is in urgent need. Sesamin (SSM) is a lignan derived from sesame seeds. In this study, the protective effect of SSM against UC and the underlying mechanism were investigated  and . Our data showed that SSM protected Caco-2 cells from HO-induced oxidative stress injury via GSH-mediated scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was significantly increased by SSM, and the ability of SSM to activate Nrf2-targeted genes was further confirmed in Caco-2 cells using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of SSM. Additionally, we found that SSM also activated advanced protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Caco-2 cells, while either AKT or ERK inhibition can prevent SSM-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, SSM displayed a better protective effect against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced UC compared with -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced Nrf2 signaling and activated AKT/ERK were also observed in the colon of mice after SSM administration. These results first demonstrate the protective effect of SSM against UC and indicate that the effect is associated with AKT/ERK activation and subsequent Nrf2 signaling enhancement. This study provides a new insight into the medicinal value of SSM and proposes it as a new natural nutrition for better managing the symptoms of UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504527>Application of Herbaceous Medications for Inflammatory Bowel Disease as a Complementary and Alternative Therapy.</a></h2><p>Conventional medicine for the treatment of  is prevailingly composed of sulfadiazine, -aminosalicylic acid, glucocorticoid, and immunosuppressants, which have the merits of alleviating intestine inflammation, but long-term use of these drugs may cause toxic side effects; additionally, these drugs may be expensive.

Understanding these geographical differences is crucial for formulating effective strategies for preventing and treating . We report the prevalence, mortality, and overall burden of  in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017, based on data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017.We modelled mortality due to  using a standard Cause of Death Ensemble model including data mainly from vital registrations. To estimate the non-fatal burden, we used data presented in primary studies, hospital discharges, and claims data, and used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to ensure consistency between measures. Mortality, prevalence, years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated. All of the estimates were reported as numbers and rates per 100 000 population, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI).In 2017, there were 6·8 million (95% UI 6·4-7·3) cases of  globally. The age-standardised prevalence rate increased from 79· (75·9-83·) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 84·3 (79·2-89·9) per 100 000 population in 2017. The age-standardised death rate decreased from 0·61 (0·55-0·69) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 0·51 (0·42-0·54) per 100 000 population in 2017. At the GBD regional level, the highest age-standardised prevalence rate in 2017 occurred in high-income North America (422·0 [398·7-446·1] per 100 000) and the lowest age-standardised prevalence rates were observed in the Caribbean (6·7 [6·3-7·2] per 100 000 population). High Socio-demographic Index (SDI) locations had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate, while low SDI regions had the lowest age-standardised prevalence rate. At the national level, the USA had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate (464· [438·6-490·9] per 100 000 population), followed by the UK (449·6 [420·6-481·6] per 100 000). Vanuatu had the highest age-standardised death rate in 2017 (1·8 [0·8-3·2] per 100 000 population) and Singapore had the lowest (0·08 [0·06-0·14] per 100 000 population). The total YLDs attributed to  almost doubled over the study period, from 0·56 million (0·39-0·77) in 1990 to 1·02 million (0·71-1·38) in 2017. The age-standardised rate of DALYs decreased from 26· (21·0-33·0) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 23·2 (19·1-27·8) per 100 000 population in 2017.The prevalence of  increased substantially in many regions from 1990 to 2017, which might pose a substantial social and economic burden on governments and health systems in the coming years.

Deficiency in IL-10 signaling dramatically increased IL-1β release by moDCs. IL-1β boosted IFNγ secretion by CD4 T cells either directly or indirectly by stimulating moDCs to secrete IL-12. As predicted a signature of IL-10 dysfunction was observed in a subgroup of pediatric  patients having higher IL-1β expression in activated immune cells and macroscopically affected intestinal tissue. In agreement, reduced IL10RA expression was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a subgroup of pediatric  patients exhibited diminished IL-10 responsiveness. Our data unveil an important mechanism by which IL-10 controls IFNγ-secreting CD4 T cells in humans and identifies IL-1β as a potential classifier for a subgroup of  patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420068>Development, analytical validation, and initial clinical evaluation of a radioimmunoassay for the measurement of soluble CD25 concentrations in canine serum.</a></h2><p>During immune activation, CD25 is expressed by T cells, and its soluble form (sCD25) is released into the extracellular matrix and the bloodstream. In humans, serum sCD25 concentrations are used as a surrogate marker for autoimmune diseases, malignancies, and transplant rejection. However, a canine-specific assay for the measurement of sCD25 in dog serum has not previously been described. Therefore, the aims of this study were to develop and analytically validate a radioimmunoassay to measure sCD25 in canine serum, to establish a reference interval for canine sCD25, and to test the clinical utility of this assay with serum samples for dogs with various diseases. A competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) was developed and analytically validated. Analytical validation consisted of lower limit of detection (LLOD), dilutional parallelism, spiking recovery, and intra- and inter-assay variability using pooled surplus canine serum samples. A reference interval was established in healthy dogs and serum samples from dogs with various types of neoplasia, , liver disease, suspected pancreatitis, or suspected small intestinal disease and serum samples with an increased C-reactive protein concentration (CRP) were analyzed to test the clinical utility of the assay. LLOD was calculated to be 0. ng/mL. The mean (±SD) observed-to-expected ratio (O/E) for serial dilutions was 101.7 ± 14.0%, and the mean (± SD) O/E for spiking recovery was 93.2 ± 4.2%. Coefficients of variation (CVs) for intra-assay variability were ≤12.% (mean ± SD: 7. ± 4.2%), and inter-assay CVs were ≤15.7% (mean ± SD: 11 ± 4.4%). A reference interval (RI) for canine sCD25 of 1.2-4.2 ng/mL was established from a population of 112 clinically healthy dogs. Dogs with neoplasia and dogs with suspected small intestinal disease had decreased concentrations of serum sCD25 when compared to healthy dogs (p < 0.0001, respectively). However, the majority of clinical samples used in this study were within the reference interval. Median concentrations of serum sCD25 were 1.9 ng/mL for healthy dogs. Dogs with cancer, , liver disease, suspected pancreatitis, or suspected small intestinal disease, as well as sera with an increased serum CRP concentration, had median serum sCD25 concentrations of 1.6 ng/mL, 2.1 ng/mL, 2.2 ng/mL, 1.7 ng/mL, 1. ng/mL, and 1.8 ng/mL, respectively. Thus, the RIA described here is linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible for measuring sCD25 in canine serum. However, this assay shows little clinical utility of sCD25 as a biomarker for dogs with inflammatory, autoimmune, and/or neoplastic conditions.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377948>H.pylori Infection Alleviates Acute and Chronic Colitis with the Expansion of Regulatory B Cells in Mice.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies showed that there was an inverse relationship between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (). Our previous research indicated that the regulatory immune responses induced by H. pylori infection were not limited to gastric mucosa, and the balance of intestinal mucosal immunity was influenced. In this study, mice were infected with H. pylori SS1, and then colitis was induced by 3% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS), to investigate the role of the regulatory B cells in the effects of H. pylori infection on acute and chronic colitis. In acute and chronic colitis groups, DAI and colonic histological scores reduced significantly and colon length shorted less, the proinflammatory cytokines mRNA expression downregulated in colonic mucosa, and the percentages of CD19IL-10Breg cells were higher in the H. pylori/DSS co-treated groups compared with the DSS-treated groups. Our study suggests that H. pylori infection can alleviate the acute and chronic colitis induced by DSS, and CD19IL-10Breg cells may play a critical role in the alleviation of acute and chronic colitis following H. pylori infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621721>Intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei A.

The intestinal anti-inflammatory effect of xique-xique cladode juice was evaluated in the present study. A dose of  mL kg-1 had a protective effect on intestinal inflammation, with an improvement in macroscopic damage, and a decrease in pro-inflammatory markers and oxidative stress, in addition to preserving the colonic tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the downregulation of IL-17, NF-κB, and iNOS, and upregulation of SOCs-1, ZO-1, and MUC-2. These protective effects could be attributed to the phenolic compounds as well as the fibers present in xique-xique juice.

We analyzed data from 2 national population cohorts to compare outcomes of patients with CD already on -ASA therapy who started treatment with an anti-TNF agent and then either stopped or continued -ASA.The primary outcome was any adverse clinical event, defined as a composite of new corticosteroid use or CD-related hospitalization or surgery. We collected data from the Truven MarketScan health claims database (United States, US) and the Danish health registers. Our analysis included patients with CD who started anti-TNF therapy after at least 90 days of oral -ASA therapy. Patients were classified as stopping -ASA if therapy was discontinued within 90 days of starting anti-TNF. We performed multivariable Cox regression models controlling for demographics, clinical factors, and healthcare utilization. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% CI values were calculated, comparing stopping -ASA with continuing -ASA.A total of 3178 patients with CD were included in our final analysis (2960 in the US and 218 in Denmark). Stopping -ASA after initiating anti-TNF therapy was not associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events in the US cohort (aHR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.77-1.03; P=.13) or in the Danish cohort (aHR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.68-1.87; P=.63). Similar results were obtained from sensitivity analyses of concomitant immunomodulator use and duration of -ASA treatment before initiation of anti-TNF therapy.In a retrospective analysis of 2 national databases, we found that stopping -ASA therapy for patients with CD who were starting anti-TNF therapy did not increase their risk of adverse clinical events. These results should be validated in a prospective study.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Less is known about the impact of corticosteroid-sparing  therapies on pneumonia risk or the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination in reducing all-cause pneumonia in real-world  cohorts.We performed a population-based study using an established Veterans Health Administration cohort of 29,957  patients. We identified all patients who developed bacterial pneumonia. Cox survival analysis was used to determine the association of corticosteroids at study entry and as a time-varying covariate, corticosteroid-sparing agents (immunomodulators and antitumor necrosis-alpha [TNF] inhibitors), and pneumococcal vaccination with the development of all-cause pneumonia.Patients with  who received corticosteroids had a greater risk of pneumonia when controlling for age, gender, and comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR] 2.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90-2.57 for prior use; HR = 3.42; 95% CI, 2.92-4.01 for use during follow-up). Anti-TNF inhibitors (HR 1.52; 95% CI, 1.02-2.26), but not immunomodulators (HR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77-1.07), were associated with a small increase in pneumonia. A history of pneumonia was strongly associated with subsequent pneumonia (HR = 4.41; 95% CI, 3.70-.27). Less than 15% of patients were vaccinated against pneumococcus, and this was not associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia (HR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80-1.30) in this cohort.In a large US cohort, corticosteroids were confirmed to increase pneumonia risk. Tumor necrosis-alpha inhibitors were associated with a smaller increase in the risk of pneumonia. Surprisingly, pneumococcal vaccination did not reduce all-cause pneumonia in this population, though few patients were vaccinated.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Observation started with the date of the first prescription of index tumor necrosis factor α-inhibitors (anti-TNFα) or vedolizumab (VDZ) therapy and lasted 12 months. Non-persistence was assumed in case of a switch to another biologic or a treatment gap of >90 days.We included 1,248  biologic treatment starters (502 adalimumab, 77 golimumab, 441 infliximab, 228 VDZ); 837/411 were biologic-naïve (bio-naïve)/ biologic-experienced (bio-experienced). Mean age of bio-naïve/bio-experienced anti-TNFα patients was 39.2/38.1 years (54.9%/56.7% female) and 42.6/37.8 years for VDZ patients (56.3%/54.9% female). Seven hundred and seventy-two patients (61.9%) were persistent with their index biologic therapy after 12 months (61.9%/61.8% bio-naïve/bio-experienced). Percentage of persistent patients was 69.7% for VDZ (65.6%/71.3%) and 60.1% for anti-TNFα (61.4%/55.%). VDZ was associated with later non-persistence in a multivariable Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 0.675; p = 0.003) compared to anti-TNFα.Only 60-70% of  -patients are still persistent with their biologic therapy after 12 months.

Mice with  induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents -like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.% DSS for 7 days induced -like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented -like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

In this work, several thiophene-based and furan-based compounds modeled after AMD3100 and WZ811-two known antagonists that interrupt the CXCR4-CXCL12 interaction-were synthesized and analyzed. Fifteen hit compounds were identified; these compounds exhibited effective concentrations (EC) lower than 1000 nM (AMD3100) and inhibited invasion of metastatic cells by at least 45%. Selected compounds (2d, 2j, 8a) that inhibited metastatic invasion at a higher rate than WZ811 (62%) were submitted for a carrageenan inflammation test, where both 8a and 2j reduced inflammation in the same range as WZ811 (40%) but did not reduce inflammation more than 40%. Select compounds were also modeled in silico to show key residue interactions.

The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of infliximab (IFX) in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe UC and inadequate response to existing treatment.This open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter, Phase 3 trial was conducted at 17 centers in Japan between April 2012 and September 2014. Pediatric patients (aged 6-17 years) diagnosed with moderate-to-severe UC received a treatment protocol comprising  mg/kg IFX at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, and Clinical Activity Index (CAI)-based responders at Week 8 also received treatment at 8-week intervals at Weeks 14 and 22, with a final evaluation at Week 30.A total of 21 patients were treated in this study. IFX therapy rapidly improved clinical symptoms, and this effect was maintained for up to 30 weeks. Overall CAI-based remission rate was 42.9% and overall Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI)-based remission rate was 19.0%. Median partial Mayo score was 6.0 at baseline and 4.0 at Week 30 (overall). Among the eight patients who underwent sigmoidoscopy, Mayo response was achieved at Week 30 (overall) in three patients (37.%). Trough serum IFX concentrations in Week 8 CAI-based responders were maintained throughout the study period. Adverse events and serious adverse events were observed in 95.2 and 14.3% of patients, respectively.These results support the use of IFX in the treatment of pediatric patients with UC with inadequate response to existing treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number:  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322753>Mucosal gene expression changes induced by anti-TNF treatment in inflammatory bowel disease patients.</a></h2><p>In the last two decades anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy for inflammatory bowel disease () has been widely used to induce and maintain clinical and endoscopical remission, completely changing management of the disease.

We found that both therapeutic regimens induce a decrease in LCN2, NOS2, and TFF1, the levels of which are overexpressed in drug-free patients compared to non- control subjects. Interestingly, a stronger effect of anti-TNF drugs was observed on LCN2 and TFF1 levels. However, -ASA seems to induce a more robust reduction of NOS2 expression. Moreover, we found that anti-TNF treatment significantly increased ABCB1, leading to levels similar to those found in non- control subjects.© 2019 The Authors.
