Changes in microbiome composition are implicated in virulence adaptation by herbivores to host plant species or host populations (including crop varieties). We examined patterns in adaptation by the green leafhopper, , to near-isogenic rice lines (NILs) with one or two resistance genes and the recurrent parent T65, without resistance genes. Only the line with two resistance genes was effective in reducing leafhopper fitness. After 20 generations on the resistant line, selected leafhoppers attained similar survival,  gain, and egg laying to leafhoppers that were continually reared on the susceptible recurrent parent, indicating that they had adapted to the resistant host. By sequencing the 16s rRNA gene, we described the microbiome of leafhoppers from colonies associated with five collection sites, and continually reared or switched between NILs. The microbiomes included 69-119 OTUs of which 44 occurred in ≥90% of samples. Of these, 14 OTUs were assigned to the obligate symbiont  clade. After 20 generations of selection, collection site had a greater effect than host plant on microbiome composition. Six bacteria genera, including , were associated with leafhopper virulence. However, there was significant within-treatment, site-related variability in the prevalence of these taxa such that the mechanisms underlying their association with virulence remain to be determined. Our results imply that these taxa are associated with leafhopper nutrition. Ours is the first study to describe microbiome diversity and composition in rice leafhoppers. We discuss our results in light of the multiple functions of herbivore microbiomes during virulence adaptation in insect herbivores.© 2019 The Authors.

Accurate assessment to quantify the severity of these deformities by clinical examination alone can be challenging. Radiographs are a valuable adjunct for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. However, static radiographs during relaxed standing may not reflect the dynamic changes in the foot skeleton during functional activities such as walking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to predict dynamic foot movements during walking from planar standing radiographs to reveal the significance of the radiographic analysis for the assessment of foot function.Patients 8-17 years with flexible flatfeet (FFF, n=217) recurrent clubfeet (RCF n=38) and overcorrected clubfeet (OCCF, n=71) of non-neurogenic or syndromic origin and pes cavovarus due to peripheral neuropathy (PNP, n=48) were retrospectively included. Patients underwent gait analysis with the Oxford Foot Model and radiographic examination in anterior-posterior and lateral view during standing. Multilinear predictor analysis of selected gait parameters was performed based on radiographic .The variance that was explained by radiography was greatest for the transverse plane forefoot abduction with 33% for OCCF, 50% for RCF and 59% for PNP. Flatfeet and foot kinematics in the other planes or between rearfoot and tibia showed little or no relation.The static  of foot deformities by radiography could explain only a small amount of variance in foot kinematics during walking, in particular for FFF. An explanation may be that the forces during  bearing bear little resemblance to those during gait in terms of neither magnitude nor direction. These findings suggest that foot function cannot be accurately assessed solely from static radiographic observations of the foot, commonly undertaken in clinical practice.Copyright © 2019 European Foot and Ankle Society.

The current study proposes to analyze the prevalence of common mental disorders (CMDs) and associated factors in urban residents of São Paulo, Brazil. Based on data collected in the Health Survey in São Paulo City (ISA-Capital) in 2015, the study identified the presence of CMDs using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). The association of CMDs with sociodemographic variables and health conditions was analyzed as relative frequency, corrected by the respective  resulting from cluster sampling, estimating the prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) and assessing the association's significance by the chi-square test, corrected by the F distribution. Prevalence of CMDs was 19.7% (95%CI: 18.2-21.4), higher in women (24.3%); persons 60 years or older (25.3%); followers of the African-Brazilian umbanda or candomblé religions (37.8%); widows/widowers (30.4%); individuals that had never attended school (31.4%); unemployed (28.3%); those with family income up to one minimum wage (28.8%); individuals that reported illness in the previous 15 days (36.9%); those with physical disabilities (21.6%); mental or intellectual disabilities (44.4%); emotional or mental problems (48.9%); headache (33.63%); and individuals with one or more chronic diseases (24.1%). The information in this study reaffirms the relevance of the prevalence of CMDs and their association with the most vulnerable social groups, corroborating the need to implement public  in mental health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695277>High tibial osteotomy in obese patients: Is successful surgery enough for a good outcome?</a></h1><p>Knee osteoarthritis is the most common articular pathology. High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a frequently used treatment procedure in medial osteoarthritis of the knee joint. We aimed to reveal factors that affect clinical and radiologic outcomes by evaluating the efficacy of HTO in patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 who were not appropriate for prostheses considering their activity, degree of pain, and age.HTO was performed using the medial open wedge technique who presented to the orthopedics polyclinic with symptoms of knee pain, whose BMI was over 30 kg/m2. All patients were diagnosed as having mechanical axis deviation and isolated medial compartmental arthrosis between 2013 and 2015.The clinical and radiologic follow-ups of patients were performed on day 45, at month 3, month 6, and after 1 year. The knee scoring system from the American Knee Society (AKS), and range of motion (ROM) were used in the functional evaluation of the patients.Eighteen patients were included in the study. Thirteen patients (72.2%) were women and 5 (27.8%) were men. Preop axis score was found significantly lower compared with the axis scores at postop month 6 and in final follow-up, the postoperative final follow-up axis score was found significantly lower than the axis score at month 6 (p < 0.05).We anticipated in our study that the better outcomes obtained in the early period might be maintained for longer in parallel with  loss and decreased BMI in the postoperative period. We believe that it is important to perform complication-free HTO with the correct technique, and by organizing a rapid and systematic  loss process.© 2018.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695075>Mapping quantitative trait loci for yield-related traits and predicting candidate genes for grain  in maize.</a></h1><p>Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapped in different genetic populations are of great significance for marker-assisted breeding. In this study, an F population were developed from the crossing of two maize inbred lines SG-5 and SG-7 and applied to QTL mapping for seven yield-related traits. The seven traits included 100-kernel , ear length, ear diameter, cob diameter, kernel row number, ear , and grain  per plant. Based on an ultra-high density linkage map, a total of thirty-three QTLs were detected for the seven studied traits with composite interval mapping (CIM) method, and fifty-four QTLs were indentified with genome-wide composite interval mapping (GCIM) methods. For these QTLs, Fourteen were both detected by CIM and GCIM methods. Besides, eight of the thirty QTLs detected by CIM were identical to those previously mapped using a F population (generating from the same cross as the mapping population in this study), and fifteen were identical to the reported QTLs in other recent studies. For the fifty-four QTLs detected by GCIM, five of them were consistent with the QTLs mapped in the F population of SG-5 × SG-7, and twenty one had been reported in other recent studies. The stable QTLs associated with grain  were located on maize chromosomes 2, 5, 7, and 9. In addition, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between SG-5 and SG-7 were obtained from the transcriptomic profiling of grain at different developmental stages and overlaid onto the stable QTLs intervals to predict candidate genes for grain  in maize. In the physical intervals of confirmed QTLs qKW-7, qEW-9, qEW-10, qGWP-6, qGWP-8, qGWP-10, qGWP-11 and qGWP-12, there were 213 DEGs in total. Finally, eight genes were predicted as candidate genes for grain size/. In summary, the stable QTLs would be reliable and the candidate genes predicted would be benefit for maker assisted breeding or cloning.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692733>Functional Outcomes and Complications Following Pectoralis Major Tendon Allograft Reconstruction in a Military Population.</a></h1><p>There are limited data available regarding outcomes following pectoralis major tendon (PMT) reconstruction with allograft.To evaluate the functional outcomes and complication profile following PMT reconstruction with allograft in a military population.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.All active duty military personnel who underwent PMT allograft reconstruction between 2008 and 2013 were identified. Demographics, injury characteristics, and surgical technique were recorded from the electronic medical record. Self-reported pain scores and manual strength were evaluated pre- and postoperatively, as recorded in physician electronic medical record notes, in addition to the ability and degree to which each patient was able to return to function. Standardized outcome  included the Bak criteria; visual analog scale for pain; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score; and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Complications, including rerupture and reoperation, were additionally recorded.Nine male patients (mean ± SD age, 35.7 ± 5.8 years) underwent allograft PMT reconstruction. Mean improvement in self-reported pain score at a mean 53.5 months (range, 31.1-110.9 months) was 2.1 ± 1.3 points ( = .08). Improvements in manual strength during forward flexion (0.5 ± 0.7;  = .03), adduction (0.6 ± 0.6;  = .01), and internal rotation (0.5 ± 0.7;  = .03) were significant. Seven patients (78%) returned to full preinjury level of occupational function, and 88% returned to performing the bench press, although maximum  decreased by a self-reported mean of 141.3 lb. According to the Bak criteria, 5 (56%) patients had excellent outcomes, 2 (22%) had fair outcomes, and 2 (22%) had poor outcomes. Mean visual analog scale for pain (1.9 ± 2.8), DASH (10.8 ± 17.4), ASES (88.1 ± 20.3), and SF-36 scores (96.3% ± 6.9%) were obtained for the 8 patients available at final follow-up. Complications included 2 cases (22%) of persistent shoulder pain leading to military separation, 1 rerupture (11%), and 1 (11%) surgical scar revision.While allograft reconstruction is a reliable option to decrease pain and improve function in patients with tears not amenable to primary repair, patients should be educated about the risk profile and fitness limitations after surgery.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696541>Differences in ocular biometry between urban and rural children matched by refractive error: the Shandong Children Eye Study.</a></h1><p>To determine the differences in mean ocular dimensions between urban and rural children and identify possible influencing factors.This work uses previously published data from the Shandong Children Eye Study, which was based on a random cluster sampling applied to a cross-sectional school-based study design in the rural Guanxian County and Weihai city. All children underwent auto-refractometry and biometry under cycloplegia.The study included 3290 children (aged 9.35 ± 2.93 years), consisting of 888 pairs of boys and 757 pairs of girls matched by sex, age and refractive error (each pair matching one child from urban cohort with one from the rural cohort). Overall urban children were significantly taller and heavier than rural children (t-test; p < 0.001), which was confirmed for all age groups for . Urban ocular axial lengths were significantly longer by 0.23 mm compared to the rural population (t-test; p < 0.001), mostly in younger children and boys. Meanwhile, corneal curvatures were flatter in the urban cohort by 0.08 mm (p < 0.001). This association of axial length with urban vs rural region was reduced in magnitude by 69.7% after accounting for height.For the same, matched refractive error, children from urban regions had significantly longer eyes and flatter corneal curvature than rural children. Since corneal curvature is defined during the first 2 years of life, early environmental factors may be the source of these differences in ocular dimensions.© 2019 The Authors Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics © 2019 College of Optometrists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694632>Heritabilities for the puppy  at birth in Labrador retrievers.</a></h1><p> at birth is an important predictor of neonatal mortality and morbidity in dogs. In addition, the birthweight of the puppies in a litter influences the decision to perform a cesarean section. The goal of the present study was to estimate heritabilities for the puppy birth  in Labrador retrievers.Of the 1138 Labrador retriever litters whelped at the Guiding Eye for the Blind between September 2001 and February 2018, 1013 were included in the analyses after data editing. Puppy  at birth was the target trait, measured on a continuous scale in pounds, and converted to grams. Linear mixed models were used to identify factors influencing puppy  at birth. The analyses showed that the sex of the puppy, litter size, length of gestation, adult  of the dam, parity, year of birth and inbreeding coefficient of the puppies and dams contributed to the variance of the puppy birth . Dam and litter effects were included as random effects. A multiple trait derivative free restricted maximum likelihood approach was used to estimate variance components and genetic parameters with two animal models, one without covariates (Model 1) and one with covariates (Model 2). Sex of the puppy and litter size had moderate effects, whereas gestation length, adult  of the dam, parity, year of birth and inbreeding coefficients of the dam and the puppies had minor effects. Estimates for Model 1 and Model 2 were 0.21 and 0.17 for the direct heritabilities, 0.22 and 0.22 for the maternal additive genetic heritabilities, 0.07 and 0.07 for the maternal permanent environmental proportions, and 0.14 and 0.08 for the environmental proportion of the litter.In order to estimate reliable breeding values for puppy  at birth, sex of puppy, litter size, length of gestation and the adult  of the dam should be included. Estimates could benefit from weighing the dams prior to each mating.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692525>Relationship between thyroid dysfunction and : a not so evident paradigm.</a></h1><p>Hypothyroidism has traditionally been associated with obesity, whereas hyperthyroidism has been linked to being underweight. However, very few studies have assessed these associations. The aim of this work is to evaluate the association between thyroid dysfunction and  mass index (BMI) at baseline and after normalization of the hormone levels.A retrospective, observational study of a cohort of otherwise healthy patients that were referred for evaluation of thyroid dysfunction to the Endocrine Department of Pontevedra University Complex Hospital, Spain was conducted. We collected data of BMI and thyroid hormone levels before treatment and after normalization of thyroid function within a follow-up period of 12 months.A total of 330 patients were initially selected for the study. In order to exclude variables that for any reason could influence on BMI, 235 were excluded for further studies. Another 61 patients were also excluded because incomplete data on their medical records, failure to achieve euthyroidism, or lost to follow-up. Therefore, the eligible final study group consisted of 34 patients (17 with hypothyroidism and 17 with hyperthyroidism). No differences were observed in mean baseline BMI between hypo and hyperthyroid patients (27.07±3.22 vs 26.39±4.44, =0.609). Overweight or obesity was observed in 76.5% and 58.8% of hypothyroid and hyperthyroid patients, respectively (=0.23). After normalization of thyroid function, the  of hypothyroid patients decreased from 70.93±10.06 kg to 68.68±10.14 (=0.000), while the  of hyperthyroid patients increased from 65.45±11.64 kg to 68.37±12.80 (=0.000). Their mean BMI was 26.22±3.36 and 27.57±4.98 (=0.361) for hypo- and hyperthyroid patients, respectively. 58.8% and 64.7% patients remained in the overweight/obesity range in each group (=0.72).Untreated thyroid dysfunction is not associated with BMI. Normalization of thyroid levels significantly changed the  of patients, but remaining most patients within overweight ranges.© 2019 Ríos-Prego et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695289>Arthroscopic ankle fusion to manage sequel of loss of lateral malleoli in compound crushed ankle injury.</a></h1><p>Defect in the lateral malleolus along with lateral ligamentous injury of ankle is rare. It occurs mainly due to resection of distal fibula tumors and severe trauma leading to loss of lateral malleolus. Lateral malleoli has the major contribution in  transmission to foot and ankle stability. To avoid persistent pain and gait abnormality due to ankle instability, reconstruction of bony defect is inevitable. Methods to address these defects are iliac crest bone grafting, vascular and nonvascular proximal fibula transfer, patella tendon bone graft and allograft. Donor site morbidity, allograft related problems are not rare. Arthrodesis of ankle gives painless stable joint. Arthrodesis can be performed by open and arthroscopic methods. Open method has more soft tissue dissection and too difficult in scenario with previous skin grafting with adherent skin to bone. We managed a case of compound ankle injury with loss of lateral malleolus with loss of lateral ligament in stages, first management of compound crushed ankle followed by arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis.

A well-established linear relationship exists between hypertension and obesity. The combined burden of hypertension and obesity poses significant health and economic challenges. Many environmental factors and genetic traits interact to contribute to obesity-linked hypertension. These include excess sodium re-absorption or secretion by the kidneys, a hypertensive shift of renal-pressure and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Most individuals suffering from hypertension need drugs in order to treat their raised blood pressure, and while a number of antihypertensive therapeutic agents are currently available, 50% of cases remain uncontrolled. In order to develop new and effective therapeutic agents combating obesity-induced hypertension, a thorough understanding of the molecular events leading to adipogenesis is critical. With the advent of whole genome and exome sequencing techniques, new genes and variants which can be used as markers for obesity and hypertension are being identified. This review examines the role played by alternative splicing (AS) as a contributing factor to the metabolic regulation of obesity-induced hypertension. Splicing mutations constitute at least 14% of the disease-causing mutations, thus implicating polymorphisms that effect splicing as indicators of disease susceptibility. The unique transcripts resulting from the alternate splicing of mRNA encoding proteins that play a key role in contributing to obesity would be vital to gain a proper understanding of the genetic causes of obesity. A greater knowledge of the genetic basis for obesity-linked hypertension will assist in the development of appropriate diagnostic tests as well as the identification of new personalized therapeutic targets against obesity-induced hypertension.© 2019 Dlamini et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695302>The impact of perinatal history in the occurrence of childhood obesity: a litera-ture review.</a></h1><p>It is widely accepted, that the increased prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity poses an important public health problem since it increases the risk for early onset of non-communicable diseases with potentially increased health complications during adulthood. Childhood obesity prevention is therefore of primary importance; hence it is mandatory to understand its main causes and identify the mechanisms associated with  gain. Although its etiology can be partly attributed to genetic and behavioral factors, evidence from existing literature indicates that the perinatal environment may also increase the risk of childhood obesity; the latter, however, has not been thoroughly investigated and discussed.A literature search was conducted in scientific databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus) in order to reveal recent epidemiologic studies, with emphasis on works from the last decade. Studies whose primary or secondary object was the association between type of delivery, breastfeeding and/or gestational diabetes mellitus with overweight and obesity in childhood and preadolescence were taken into account. Studies that did not meet the aim of the current review were excluded.The retrieved information revealed that there is a noteworthy association between perinatal factors and childhood and preadolescence overweight/obesity occurrence, though the exact pathways still need to be elucidated.Public health professionals should take into account perinatal determinants when estimating a child's risk of overweight and obesity development.

We aimed to study the different effects of FO versus soybean oil (SO) on growth, intestinal health and immune function of neonates with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) using a weaned piglet model. Forty pairs of male IUGR and normal birth  piglets, weaned at 21 ± 1 d, were fed diets containing either 4% FO or SO for 3 weeks consecutively. Growth performance, nutrient digestibility and intestinal function parameters, immunology and microbiota composition were determined. IUGR led to a poor growth rate, nutrient digestibility and abnormal immunology variables, whereas feeding FO diet improved systemic and gut immunity, as indicated by increased plasma concentration of immunoglobulin G and decreased CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes, and down-regulated intestinal expression of genes (MyD88, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-10). Although IUGR tended to decrease villous height, feeding FO diet tended to increase the villi-crypt ratio and up-regulated expressions of tight junction genes (Claudin-1 and ZO-1), together with increased mucosa contents of n-3 PUFAs and a lower Σn-6/Σn-3 ratio. Besides, FO diet decreased the abundance of pathogenic bacteria Spirochaetes, and increased phylum Actinobacteria, and genera Blautia and Bifidobacterium in colonic digesta. Our findings indicate that IUGR impairs growth rate, nutrient digestibility, and partly immunology variables, whereas feeding FO-supplemented diet could improve intestinal function and immunity of both IUGR and NBW pigs, associated with the altered gut microbiome and mucosal fatty acid profile.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694593>Associations between mental health competence and indicators of physical health and cognitive development in eleven year olds: findings from the UK Millennium Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>Positive mental health may support healthy development in childhood, although few studies have investigated this at a population level. We aimed to construct a measure of mental health competence (MHC), a skills-based assessment of positive mental health, using existing survey items in a representative sample of UK children, and to investigate its overlap with mental health difficulties (MHD), socio-demographic patterning, and relationships with physical health and cognitive development.We analysed the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) when children were aged 11 years. Maternal (n = 12,082) and teacher (n = 6739) reports of prosocial behaviours (PS) and learning skills (LS) were entered into latent class models to create MHC . Using descriptive statistics, we examined relationships between MHC and MHD, and the socio-demographic patterning of MHC. Associations between MHC and physical health and cognitive development were examined with relative risk ratios [RRR] (from multinomial models): BMI status (healthy , overweight, obesity); unintentional injuries since age 7 (none, 1, 2+); asthma symptoms (none, 1, 2+); and tertiles of test scores for verbal ability, spatial working memory and risk-taking. Models were adjusted for potential confounding.Four MHC classes were identified [percentages for maternal and teacher reports, respectively]: high MHC (high PS, high LS) [37%; 39%], high-moderate MHC (high PS, moderate LS) [36%; 26%]; moderate MHC (moderate PS, moderate LS) [19%; 19%]; low MHC (moderate PS, low LS) [8%; 16%]. Higher MHC was less common in socially disadvantaged children. While MHC and MHD were associated, there was sufficient separation to indicate that MHC captures more than the absence of MHD. Compared to children with high MHC, those in other MHC classes tended to have poorer physical health and cognitive development, particularly those with low MHC or high-moderate MHC. For example, children with maternal-report Low MHC were more likely to have experienced 2+ unintentional injuries (RRR: 1.5 [1.1-2.1]) and to have lower verbal ability scores (RRR: 2.5 [1.9-3.2]). Patterns of results were similar for maternal- and teacher-report MHC.MHC is not simply the inverse of MHD, and high MHC is associated with better physical health and cognitive development. Findings suggest that interventions to improve MHC may support healthy development, although they require replication.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693771>Disturbed eating behaviours do not impact treatment response in a paediatric obesity chronic care treatment programme.</a></h1><p>This study investigates the prevalence of disturbed eating behaviours in children and adolescents initiating obesity treatment, and how the prevalence varies with age, sex and  mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS). Secondly, it examines whether the presence of disturbed eating behaviours at enrolment is associated with the degree of  loss after 12 months of treatment.A total of 3621 patients aged 3-18 years enrolled in a multidisciplinary obesity treatment programme were studied. Follow-up data after a median of 12.4 months were available for 2055 patients. Upon entry, patients were assessed for the following disturbed eating behaviours: meal skipping, emotional eating, overeating and rapid eating. Height and  were measured at baseline and follow-up.At enrolment, median age was 11.4 years, median BMI SDS was 2.87, and 82.2% of patients exhibited one or more disturbed eating behaviours. The prevalence of meal skipping, emotional eating and rapid eating increased with age (P < 0.01). Patients who reported overeating or rapid eating exhibited a 0.06-0.11 higher BMI SDS at enrolment than patients without these disturbed eating behaviours (P < 0.02). After 1 year of treatment, BMI SDS was reduced in 75.7% of patients, and the median reduction was 0.24 (95% confidence interval: 0.22-0.27). Overeating was associated with a higher degree of  loss, while meal skipping, emotional eating and rapid eating did not associate with the degree of  loss at follow-up.Disturbed eating behaviours were highly prevalent in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity, and varied with age and sex. After 1 year of treatment, the degree of obesity improved, regardless of the presence of disturbed eating behaviours at treatment initiation.© 2019 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695328>Silibinin attenuates high-fat diet-induced renal fibrosis of diabetic nephropathy.</a></h1><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Silibinin is a flavonoid compound which has medicinal value. Previous studies revealed that silibinin exhibited an anti-fibrotic effect. However, whether silibinin could attenuate high-fat diet (HFD)-induced renal fibrosis remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism by which silibinin regulated renal fibrosis induced by HFD.In the present study, human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs) were treated with various concentrations of silibinin. Then, cell viability and apoptosis were measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. In addition, HRGECs were exposed to 100 nM TGF-β1 for mimicking in vitro renal fibrosis. The expressions of collagen I, fibronectin, and α-SMA were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Protein levels of p-IκB and p-p65 were examined by Western blot; meanwhile, level of NF-κB was measured by immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, HFD-induced mouse model of renal fibrosis was established. The mouse , fasting glucose, kidney /, microalbuminuria, kidney histopathology, and fibrotic area were measured to assess the severity of renal fibrosis.Low concentration of silibinin (≤50 μM) had no cytotoxicity, while high concentration of silibinin (≥75 μM) exhibited significant cytotoxicity. Additionally, TGF-β1 increased the expressions of collagen I, fibronectin, α-SMA, p-IκB, and p-p65 and decreased the level NF-κB, while these effects were notably reversed by 50 μM silibinin. Moreover, both 50 and 100 mg/kg silibinin greatly decreased HFD-induced the upregulation of kidney /, microalbuminuria, and fibrotic area. 100 mg/kg silibinin markedly reduced collagen I, fibronectin, and p-p65 expressions in mice renal tissues.Silibinin was able to attenuate renal fibrosis in vitro and in vivo via inhibition of NF-κB. These data suggested that silibinin may serve as a potential agent to alleviate the renal fibrosis of DN.© 2019 Liu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692296>The relationship between the BMI-adjusted  loss grading system and quality of life in patients with incurable cancer.</a></h1><p> loss (WL) has long been recognized as an important factor associated with reduced quality of life (QoL) and reduced survival in patients with cancer. The  mass index (BMI)-adjusted  loss grading system (WLGS) has been shown to be associated with reduced survival. However, its impact on QoL has not been established. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between this WLGS and QoL in patients with advanced cancer.A biobank analysis was undertaken of adult patients with advanced cancer. Data collected included patient demographics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and anthropometric parameters (BMI and %WL). Patients were categorized according to the BMI-adjusted WLGS into one of five distinct WL grades (grades 0-4). QoL was collected using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30. The Kruskal-Wallis test and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between the WLGS and QoL scores. Overall survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazard models.A total of 1027 patients were assessed (51% male, median age: 66 years). Gastrointestinal cancer was most prevalent (40%), and 87% of patients had metastatic disease. Half (58%) of patients had a WL grade of 0-1, while 12%, 20%, and 10% had WL grades of 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Increasing WL grades were significantly associated with poorer QoL functioning and symptoms scales (all P < 0.05). Physical, role, and emotional functioning decreased by a median of >20 points between WL grade 0 and WL grade 4, while appetite loss, pain, dyspnoea, and fatigue increased by a median score >20 points, indicative of a large clinical significant difference. Increasing WL grades were associated with deteriorating QoL summary score. WL grades 2, 3, and 4 were independently associated with a QoL summary score below the median (<77.7) [odds ratio (OR) 1.69, P = 0.034; OR 2.06, P = 0.001; OR 4.29, P < 0.001, respectively]. WL grades 3 and 4 were independently associated with reduced overall survival [hazard ratio 1.54 (95% confidence interval: 1.22-1.93), P < 0.001 and hazard ratio 1.87 (95% confidence interval: 1.42-2.45), P < 0.001, respectively].Our findings support that the WLGS is useful in identifying patients at risk of poor QoL that deteriorates with increasing WL grades. WL grade 4 is independently associated with a particularly worse prognosis and increased symptom burden. Identification and early referral to palliative care services may benefit these patients.© 2019 The Authors.

The isolated strain HS36 was identified as  based on the characteristics of the genus according to  and by 16S rRNA sequencing. The growth rate and antibacterial activity of strain HS36 in shaking culture were higher than those in static culture, while the optimal pH and temperature for antibacterial activity were 7.0 and 30°C, respectively. The active antibacterial substance was purified from a culture broth of  HS36 by Sephadex G-75 gel chromatography, Sephadex G-25 gel chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Its molecular , as estimated by Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was approximately 1,000 Da. The antibacterial substance produced by strain HS36 was stable after incubation for 1 h at 100°C. Although its antibacterial activity was optimal at pH 6-8, activity was retained at a pH range from 2 to 11. The purified antibacterial substance was inactivated by proteinase K, papain, and β-amylase treatment.

In recent years, the antioxidant activity of Radix isatidis has been widely concerned by researchers. Our previous studies have shown that Radix isatidis protein (RIP) has good antioxidant activity in vitro. In this study, the composition of the protein was characterized and its antioxidant activity in vivo was evaluated.The model of oxidative damage in mice was established by subcutaneous injection of D-galactose for 7 weeks. Commercially available kits were used to determine the content of protein and several oxidation indexes in different tissues of mice. The tissue samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and the pathological changes were observed by optical microscope. The molecular  of RIP was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The amino acid composition of RIP was determined by a non-derivative method developed by our research group.RIP significantly increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and total antioxidant capability (TAOC) but decreased the MDA level in the serum, kidney and liver. H&E stained sections of liver and kidney revealed D-galactose could cause serious injury and RIP could substantially attenuate the injury. The analysis of SDS-PAGE showed that four bands with molecular  of 19.2 kDa, 21.5 kDa, 24.8 kDa and 40.0 kDa were the main protein components of RIP.The results suggested that RIP had excellent antioxidant activity, which could be explored as a health-care product to retard aging and a good source of protein nutrition for human consumption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692255> gain velocity in infants with achondroplasia.</a></h1><p>There are virtually no data regarding appropriate oral intake in infants with dwarfing disorders such as achondroplasia, nor is there clear information regarding appropriate  gain velocity in this population. Yet, these individuals are at increased risk for both early failure to thrive and, later in life, for obesity. Having appropriate expectations regarding  gain and reasonable goals in management is imperative. We sought to clarify the rate of  gain in infants with achondroplasia during the first year of life through analysis of data from 60 infants with achondroplasia seen at least twice during the first year of life in the Midwest Regional Bone Dysplasia Clinic, University of Wisconsin-Madison between 1998 and 2018. The mean  gain velocity during the first 3 months was 23 g/day which contrasts with 30 g/day in average statured infants. Mean  gain from 0 to 12 months of age was 13 g/day. The 3% of  gain velocity during the first year of life was 8 g/day, and this rate did not differ between 0-3 months and 0-12 months of age. Infants with achondroplasia slightly more than doubled their birth  by 1 year of age in contrast to averaged statured infants who typically triple birth  by 1 year. Infants with achondroplasia can be thriving but erroneously assessed as failing to thrive if the incorrect reference values are used.

Bariatric surgery is a proven, effective method for sustained  loss. However, there is a relative paucity of data on the impact of bariatric surgery on renal outcomes.The primary objective was to evaluate the change in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in patients undergoing bariatric surgery, at 12 months after the procedure. Secondary objectives were to determine the changes in ACR at (6 and 24 months), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; 6, 12, and 24 months), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); 12 and 24 months) after the procedure.This observational retrospective cohort study included consecutive obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery.Provincial Bariatric Surgery Clinic at the Regina General Hospital, Saskatchewan.This study includes 471 consecutive obese adult patients who underwent bariatric surgery between 2008 and 2015.We studied the impact of bariatric surgery on  mass index (BMI), renal outcomes (urine ACR and eGFR) and metabolic outcomes (fasting glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and HbA1c) in 471 patients.Patients were followed for 2 years postsurgery in the bariatric clinic. Mixed linear models that accounted for the repeated nature of the data were used to access changes in outcomes over time.Patients were predominantly female (81%) with a mean age (±SD) of 46 ± 10 years. Most patients (87%) had a BMI > 40 kg/m and 81% of the patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The mean BMI decreased from 47.7 ± 7.8 kg/m at baseline to 37.1 ± 7.9 kg/m at 6 months and 34.8 ± 8.8 kg/m at 12 months. In a subcohort of patients with microalbuminuria, ACR showed an improvement from a median [interquartile] value of 5.1 [3.7-7.5] mg/mmol at baseline to 2.3 [1.2-3.6] mg/mmol at 6 months ( = .007), to 1.4 [0.9-3.7] mg/mmol at 2-year follow-up ( < .001). Similarly, eGFR increased in patients with microalbuminuria from 109 ± 10 mL/min/1.73 m at baseline to 120 ± 36 mL/min/1.73 m at 2-year follow-up ( = .013). There were statistically significant reductions in triglycerides, fasting glucose, and HbA1c.This was a retrospective chart review, with the lack of a control group. Patients with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m were not considered for surgery, and we had to measure renal outcomes predominantly on the presence of proteinuria.Our results suggest bariatric surgery significantly decreased  and consequently improved renal and metabolic outcomes (eGFR, ACR, fasting glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides) in patients with elevated BMI.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692080>Strong correlation between standing cough test and 24-hour pad  in the evaluation of male stress urinary incontinence.</a></h1><p>We sought to compare in-office physical exam findings via standing cough test (SCT) versus 24-hour pad  among men seeking treatment for postprostatectomy stress urinary incontinence (SUI).A retrospective review of a single surgeon database of incontinence procedures was performed. Documentation of SUI severity (grades 0-4) was completed by SCT preoperatively utilizing the Male Stress Incontinence Grading Scale (MSIGS). All patients had pads per day (PPD) and 24-hour pad  obtained. We determined the Spearman's correlation coefficient between these variables.We identified 104 men who underwent anti-incontinence surgery (AdVance Sling or artificial urinary sphincter [AUS]). In the sling group (65 patients), nearly all (97%) had minimal incontinence with SCT (MSIGS = 0-2). In the AUS group (39 patients), most patients (69%) had an MSIGS 3 or 4 with SCT. Spearman's coefficient between quantification of SCT and pad  for the overall group was ρ = .68 (P < .0001) demonstrating a strong positive correlation. PPD was also strongly correlated with pad  (ρ = .55, P < .0001). As seen previously, SCT and PPD were correlated (ρ = .47, P < .0001). In a multivariable model predicting pad , the effect of SCT was greater than PPD (β = 83 [54-111], P < .0001 vs 45 [2169], P = .0004).SCT findings strongly correlate to 24-hour pad  in the evaluation of male SUI. The SCT shows promise as a rapid, reliable, noninvasive measure of SUI severity before anti-incontinence surgery.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695710>Evaluation and Identification of Promising Introgression Lines Derived From Wild  Species for Broadening the Genetic Base of Cultivated Pigeonpea [ (L.) Millsp.].</a></h1><p>Pigeonpea [ (L.) Millsp.], a multipurpose and nutritious grain legume crop, is cultivated for its protein-rich seeds mainly in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa. In spite of large breeding efforts for pigeonpea improvement in India and elsewhere, genetic enhancement is inadequate largely due to its narrow genetic base and crop susceptibility to stresses. Wild  species are novel source of genetic variations for the genetic upgradation of pigeonpea cultivars. In the present study, 75 introgression lines (ILs), derived from crosses involving cultivated pigeonpea variety ICPL 87119 and wild  and  from the secondary gene pool, were evaluated for yield and yield-attributing traits in diverse environments across locations and years. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analysis revealed large genetic variations for days to 50% flower, days to maturity, plant height, primary branches per plant, pods per plant, pod  per plant, 100-seed , and grain yield per plant. Superior ILs with mid-early to medium maturity duration identified in this study are useful genetic resources for use in pigeonpea breeding. Additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis unfolded large influence of environment and genotype × environment interaction for variations in yield. A few lines such as ICPL 15023 and ICPL 15072 with yield stability were identified, while a number of lines were completely resistant (0%) to sterility mosaic diseases and/or  wilt. These lines are novel genetic resources for broadening the genetic base of pigeonpea and bring yield stability and stress tolerance.

It circulates as acylated ghrelin (AG) and unacylated ghrelin (UAG), which could have different metabolic actions in obesity. Our objective was to study the analytical performance of two new canine AG and UAG ELISAs using blood samples from healthy, normal- dogs. Additionally, the effect of a protease inhibitor (PI) on short-term sample storage was analyzed.The intra- and inter-assay precision for low, intermediate, and high AG and UAG concentrations, accuracy, limits of quantification (LQ), and detection limit (DL) of a blank sample were determined in ten healthy dogs. To study the effects of a PI on ghrelin concentrations, and AG and UAG concentrations were compared in five canine plasma samples stored for 1 month with (PI+), without (PI-), and with PI added at sample thawing (PI+th).The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 1.8%-5.7% and 2.9%-6.4% for the AG assay, and 0.8%-7.5% and 2.8%-13.4% for the UAG assay, respectively. Accuracy analyses showed nonsignificant deviation from linearity for the AG (R  = .99; Runs test: P = .37) and UAG (R  = .99; Runs test: P = .42) assays. For the AG assay, the upper LQ was >1261 pg/mL, the lower LQ was 6.2 pg/mL, and the DL was 0.3 pg/mL. For the UAG assay, the upper LQ was >1785 pg/mL, the lower LQ was 16.3 pg/mL, and the DL was 1.8 pg/mL. No differences in the AG (P = .54) and UAG (P = .95) concentrations were detected in the plasma samples subjected to PI+, PI-, and PI+th.The AG and UAG ELISA assays had acceptable precision, accuracy, lower LQ, and DLs, but upper LQ could not be established. An influence of the PI on short-term storage was not detectable. Long-term storage ± PI was not evaluated and should be investigated further.© 2019 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693348>Wintering in the Western Subarctic Pacific Increases Mercury Contamination of Red-Legged Kittiwakes.</a></h1><p>Marine methylmercury concentrations vary geographically and with depth, exposing organisms to different mercury levels in different habitats. Red-legged kittiwakes (), a specialist predator, forage on fish and invertebrates from the mesopelagic zone, a part of the ocean with elevated methylmercury concentrations. We used kittiwakes as bioindicators of MeHg concentrations in remote mesopelagic systems by examining how wintering distribution and habitat affected kittiwakes' mercury exposure. In 2011-2017, we sampled winter-grown feathers on St. George Island, Alaska, from birds equipped with geolocation loggers. We measured total mercury (THg) and nitrogen stable isotopes in nape and head feathers grown during winter, respectively. THg concentration of kittiwake nape feathers averaged 4.61 ± 0.97 μg/g dry . Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify winter habitats with remotely sensed environmental variables along each bird's track. Five habitat clusters were identified. Birds that spent more time in the Western Subarctic Gyre and those that wintered further south had elevated THg concentrations. In contrast to THg, trophic level varied annually but did not show strong spatial patterns. Our results documented spatial variability in THg exposure based on the oceanic wintering locations of red-legged kittiwakes and highlight their use as a bioindicator of MeHg across ocean basins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695063>Global transcriptome analysis of rat hypothalamic arcuate nucleus demonstrates reversal of hypothalamic gliosis following surgically and diet induced  loss.</a></h1><p>The central mechanisms underlying the marked beneficial metabolic effects of bariatric surgery are unclear. Here, we characterized global gene expression in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc) in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). 60 days post-RYGB, the Arc was isolated by laser-capture microdissection and global gene expression was assessed by RNA sequencing. RYGB lowered  and adiposity as compared to sham-operated DIO rats. Discrete transcriptome changes were observed in the Arc following RYGB, including differential expression of genes associated with inflammation and neuropeptide signaling. RYGB reduced gene expression of glial cell markers, including Gfap, Aif1 and Timp1, confirmed by a lower number of GFAP immunopositive astrocyte profiles in the Arc. Sham-operated -matched rats demonstrated a similar glial gene expression signature, suggesting that RYGB and dietary restriction have common effects on hypothalamic gliosis. Considering that RYGB surgery also led to increased orexigenic and decreased anorexigenic gene expression, this may signify increased hunger-associated signaling at the level of the Arc. Hence, induction of counterregulatory molecular mechanisms downstream from the Arc may play an important role in RYGB-induced  loss.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692532>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors as add-on therapy to insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h1><p>Addition of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors to insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may achieve better glycemic control. However, results of pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are inconsistent. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of RCTs to evaluate efficacy and safety of DPP4 inhibitors compared with placebo/no treatment as add-on therapy to insulin in T2DM patients.Relevant studies were identified via a search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases. A fixed or random effect model was applied according to the heterogeneity.Overall, 22 RCTs with 6,957 T2DM patients were included. Addition of DPP4 inhibitors to insulin was associated with significantly reduced HbA1c as compared with controls (weighed mean difference [WMD]: -0.54%, <0.001). The benefits of DPP4 inhibitors as add-on therapy on HbA1c were independent of study design, follow-up duration, categories of DPP4 inhibitors used, and using of fixed/adjustable insulin doses as indicated by predefined subgroup analyses. Moreover, addition of DPP4 inhibitors to insulin was associated with significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (WMD: -0.47mmol/L, <0.001), postprandial glucose at 2 hrs (WMD: -2.03 mmol/L, <0.001), and daily dose of insulin (WMD: -2.73U/d, <0.001), while  (WMD: 0.02 g, =0.81) or risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia (risk ratio: 0.92, =0.37) were not affected.Addition of DPP4 inhibitors to insulin significantly improved the glycemic control in T2DM patients without further increasing the risk of  gain and hypoglycemia.© 2019 Wang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692697>Assessment of wasting and associated factors among under five children of Wukro town, Tigray regional, North Ethiopia: a cross sectional study.</a></h1><p>Globally, 50 million children under 5 were wasted; of which 16 million were severely wasted. A severely wasted child is at a nine times higher risk of dying. To prevent this problem, it is necessary to determine the magnitude and factors associated with childhood wasting. In Ethiopia specifically Wukro town, Tigray regional state there is no clear information regarding under five wasting. Therefore, the study assessed the prevalence and associated factors of wasting among under five children in Wukro town, North Ethiopia. Objective: to assess the prevalence of wasting and associated factors among under five children of Wukro town, Tigray, North Ethiopia, 2017/2018.Community based cross-sectional study design with a single population proportion formula was used with a total sample size of 400 children. Wukro town has three kebele, two kebelle were included in the study through simple random sampling method. There was proportional allocation of subjects to each kebelle and final study subject was selected using systematic method. In case there were more than one child in the household one child was selected randomly. The data were collected by face to face interview and measuring of  and height after the instrument was pre-tested. The anthropometric results were entered in to Emergency nutritional assessment (ENA) to calculate Z-Score. The collected data and result of Z-score were entered in to Statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 20. Finally, results were presented in texts, graphs and tables.A total of 394 under five children were participated in this study, which gave a response rate of 98.5%. The respondents were females 222 (56.3%) and 106(26.95%) were in the age group of 12-23 month. The overall prevalence of wasting was 28 (7.2%). Out of this 14 (3.6%) were wasted and 14 (3.6%) were severely wasted. Under five children those, whose family does not live together were 3.086 times more likely to be wasted compared to under five children those, whose family live together (P=.038, OR=3.086, & 95% CI= (1.061, 8.970). Under five children those, whose mother did not taken family planning were 2.530 times more likely to be wasted compared to under five children those, whose mother take family planning (P=.038, OR=2.530, & 95% CI= (1.054, 6.074)).Significant numbers of mothers were not taken extra food during pregnancy and lactation.

The current study was set out to examine the role of reward and punishment sensitivity in adolescent obesity by differentiating between reward responsivity and reward drive, and by complementing self-report  with performance-based  indexing attention for cues signaling reward and punishment as well as effort to approach reward and avoid punishment. Participants were adolescents aged 12-23, with obesity ( = 51, adjusted BMI [(actual BMI/Percentile 50 of BMI for age and gender) × 100) between 143 and 313%], and with a healthy  ( = 51, adjusted BMI between 75 and 129%). Individuals with obesity did not significantly differ from adolescents with a healthy  in reward responsivity, reward drive or attention to cues signaling reward. Further, no differences in self-reported punishment sensitivity or attention for cues signaling punishment were found between obese and healthy  adolescents. The current study thus does not corroborate the theories that general reward and punishment sensitivity play a role in obesity.Copyright © 2019 Jonker, van Malderen, Glashouwer, Vervoort, Braet, Goossens and de Jong.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696340>The synergistic effect between adult  changes and CYP24A1 polymorphisms is associated with pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer risk.</a></h1><p>Vitamin D (VD) metabolism regulates adipose tissue, lipogenesis inflammation, and tumor growth. CYP24A1 is the key enzyme for metabolic inactivation of active VD (1,25(OH)D). We examined whether common germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP24A1 gene could affect the association between adult  gain and breast cancer (BC) risk.The population-based case-control study included 818 patients with primary BC and 935 residence and age matched healthy controls. We studied the relationships between CYP24A1 gene SNPs (rs2209314, rs2585428, rs2762941, rs3787555, rs4809959, rs73913757, rs912505, and rs927a650), adult  change and BC risk. Gene- change interactions were analyzed.Neither of CYP24A1 gene SNPs was associated with BC risk in the study participants. However, we found consistent gene- interactions with increasing adult  gain for CYP24A1-rs2762941 (P-interaction = 0.0089) and CYP24A1-rs927650 (P-interaction = 0.0283). Adult  gain has a higher premenopausal BC risk with double variant T alleles of rs927650 compared to women carrying at least one wild-type C allele (OR for TT = 1.82, 95% CI 1.10-3.01; for CT = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.14; for CC = 1.12 95% CI 0.93-1.35). Women with double wild-type A alleles were at a higher postmenopausal BC risk compared to those carrying at least one variant-type G allele (OR for AA = 1.51, 95% CI 1.29-1.76; for AG = 1.13, 95% CI 0.98-1.30; for GG = 1.22 95% CI 0.95-1.57). When stratified by CYP24A1 SNPs genotypes,  gain in adulthood increased postmenopausal BC risk of women with homozygous allele compared to women with heterozygotes allele.Significant interactions of  change with CYP24A1 polymorphisms suggest CYP24A1 as a potential link between  change and BC risk and the possibility that the impact of adult  gain on postmenopausal BC risk may be enhanced by homozygous alleles of CYP24A1 SNPs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692640>Biotransformation of 2,4-dinitrotoluene by the beneficial association of engineered  with .</a></h1><p>2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) is a priority environmental xenobiotic pollutant which has toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic properties. Thus, its biodegradation by applying recent approaches such as taking advantage of plant-bacteria interactions is crucial. In this work, the genes from  sp. R34, necessary for 2,4-DNT degradation, were integrated into wild-type  () KT2440 genome, and this strain, named KT.DNT, was inoculated to soil in in vitro conditions. To estimate the disappearance of 2,4-DNT in contaminated soil, samples were taken from different time intervals, extracted and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Biotransformation of 2,4-DNT increased gradually and the degradation in soil after 14-days of treatment with the bacterium was found to be the 97.1%, indicating that the engineered strain could be a remarkable candidate for in situ bioremediation of 2,4-DNT-contaminated sites. In addition, in vitro interaction of this bacterium with a model plant,  (), enhanced lateral root and root hair formation together with dry root . Moreover, the initial 2,4-DNT concentration was decreased to 68% within 2 h with the plant-associated KT.DNT in liquid culture. Hence, the usage of this bacterium with plants could also be a promising application for the 2,4-DNT biotransformation.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696368>The impact of neuropsychiatric disease on fetal growth: a case-control study.</a></h1><p>To determine the impact of depression, epilepsy and drug abuse during pregnancy on delivery and fetal outcome.

The primary endpoint was change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline at 16 weeks.At 16 weeks, empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg significantly decreased HbA1c (adjusted mean difference, -0.92% [95% CI -1.11, -0.73] and -1.00% [-1.18, -0.82]; both p<0.0001) compared with placebo. This difference was maintained up to 52 weeks (adjusted mean difference at 52 weeks, -0.90% [-1.09, -0.70] and -0.96% [-1.15, -0.77]; both p<0.0001). At 52 weeks, significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose (adjusted mean difference, -27.62 mg/dL [-36.15, -19.08] and -31.99 mg/dL [-40.35, -23.62]) and  (-1.78 kg [-2.46, -1.10] and -1.92 kg [-2.58, -1.25]) were also seen with empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg compared with placebo (all p<0.0001). At 52 weeks, the frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were similar between treatment groups; confirmed hypoglycaemia was reported slightly more in empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg patients (23.3% and 22.2% vs 14.4%). All hypoglycaemic events were mild in severity; no episodes required assistance.In Japanese patients with insufficiently controlled T2D, adding empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg to insulin treatment was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c at 16 weeks and was generally well tolerated.

The aim of this study was to investigate time trends in dietary patterns and nutrient intake in an older population, in order to increase the understanding of whether dietary recommendations are followed and if nutrient needs are met.Cross-sectional data was derived from five samples of 70-year-olds examined 1971-72, 1981-83, 1992-93, 2000-02 and 2014-16 from the Gothenburg H70 birth cohort studies in Sweden. A total of 2246 individuals (56% women) participated. Dietary intake was determined by the diet history method, which is an interview including questions on usual frequencies and portion sizes of food intake during the preceding three months. Recommended values of nutrient intake and determinants of healthful dietary patterns were based on the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2012. Statistical analyses were performed using general linear models, student's t-test and chi-square test, stratified by sex.The intake of fruits and vegetables, fish and seafood, whole grain products and nuts and seeds increased during the study period (p < 0.0001), among both sexes. However, there was also an increase in alcohol intake (p < 0.0001), especially from wine and beer, and in 2014-16 more than 30% had an alcohol intake above recommendations. Protein intake increased (p < 0.0001 for women and p = 0.0004 for men), and 48% of the women and 37% of the men had a protein intake above recommended 1.2 g/kg  and day in 2014-16. The proportion of participants at risk of inadequate intake of vitamins C, D and folate decreased during the study period, among both sexes (p < 0.0001). However, vitamin D intake from diet was still below average requirement level of 7.5 μg/day for 49% of the women and 32% of the men in 2014-16.Dietary patterns have changed among 70-year-olds during the past five decades, with an increase in healthful foods and a higher nutrient density in later born birth cohorts. However, the intake of alcohol increased, especially among women. Results from this study can be useful as a basis for dietary guidelines and used for prevention strategies involving older adults in population-based and health care settings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692907>The phenanthrene derivative PJ34 exclusively eradicates human pancreatic cancer cells in xenografts.</a></h1><p>Recent reports demonstrate an exclusive eradication of a variety of human cancer cells by the modified phenanthridine PJ34. Their eradication during mitosis is attributed to PJ34 preventing NuMA clustering in the mitotic spindle poles of human malignant cells, which is crucial for their normal mitosis. Here, the effect of PJ34 is tested in cell cultures and xenografts of human pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma. Evidence is presented for a substantial reduction (80-90%) of PANC1 cancer cells in xenografts, measured 30 days after the treatment with PJ34 has been terminated. Benign cells infiltrated into the PANC1 tumors (stroma) were not affected. Growth,  gain and behavior of the treated nude mice were not impaired during, and 30 days after the treatment with PJ34. The efficient eradication of malignant cells in human pancreas cancer xenografts presents a new model of pancreas cancer treatment.Copyright: © 2019 Visochek et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693601>Multiphase Iodine Contrast-Enhanced SPECT/CT Outperforms Nonenhanced SPECT/CT for Preoperative Localization of Small Parathyroid Adenomas.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to assess the value of intravenously contrast-enhanced CT in conjunction with Tc-MIBI SPECT for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenoma.One hundred ninety-two patients with primary hyperparathyroidism were enrolled in the study between May 2015 and May 2017. The patients underwent a preoperative "one-stop shop" examination with Tc-MIBI SPECT/CT by using dual time-point (10 and 90 minutes) protocol and both nonenhanced CT and contrast-enhanced CT acquisition in the arterial and venous phase, 35 and 75 seconds, respectively, after contrast medium injection start.

The addition of contrast-enhanced CT increased the sensitivity from 81.1% to 89.9% (P = 0.003). The specificity of nonenhanced SPECT/CT was similar to contrast-enhanced CT (96.1% vs 97.9%; P = 0.077). For patients with uniglandular disease (n = 140, 94.0%), the sensitivity increased from 86.4% to 93.6% (P = 0.021) and the specificity from 96.2% to 97.9% (P = 0.118) by adding contrast-enhanced CT. In patients with multiglandular disease (n = 9, 6.0%), adding contrast-enhanced CT improved detection sensitivity from 42.1% to 63.2%.

However, the printable LCE ink is only in the form of monomeric precursors and the deformation mode is limited to contraction/extension deformation. Herein, we report a novel approach to break through these limitations. We achieved 4D printing of single component liquid crystal polymer ink in its isotropy state through direct ink writing (DIW) technology. Drawing force imposed by the movement of nozzle in the extruded printing process was able to align the mesogen units along the specific printing path. Orientation gradient perpendicular to the printing direction was obtained due to the existence of temperature gradient between the two sides of printed samples, and can be further fixed by post-photo crosslinking treatment through the dimerizable groups in the LCE, realizing a new actuation mode in the field of extrusion-based printing of LCE actuators. The printed film was able to change reversibly from a strip to a tightly hollow cylinder, and can reversibly lift up an object with roughly 600 times its own . The orientation gradient can be patterned through liquid-assistant printing or programmed structure design to integrate both bending and contraction actuation modes on the same printed sample, leading to complex deformation and 2D planar porous structure to 3D porous cylinder transition. This study opens up a new prospect to directly print a wide variety of LCE actuators with versatile actuation modes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693749>Ivermectin use in children below 15 kg: potential benefits for onchocerciasis and scabies elimination programs.</a></h1><p>We read with interest the paper by M Levy et al about the treatment of scabies with ivermectin in infants and children under 15kg of  .

We sought to determine the factors that held the most prognostic  in the pre- and postoperative setting for each BCLC stage by applying a machine learning method.Patients who underwent resection for BCLC-0, A and B HCC between 2000 and 2017 were identified from an international multi-institutional database. A Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model was used to generate homogeneous groups of patients relative to overall survival (OS) based on pre- and postoperative factors.Among 976 patients, 63 (6.5%) had BCLC-0, 745 (76.3%) had BCLC-A, and 168 (17.2%) had BCLC-B HCC. Five-year OS among BCLC-0/A and BCLC-B patients was 64.2% versus 50.2%, respectively (p = 0.011). The preoperative CART model selected α-fetoprotein (AFP) and Charlson comorbidity score (CCS) as the first and second most important preoperative factors of OS among BCLC-0/A patients, whereas radiologic tumor burden score (TBS) was the best predictor of OS among BCLC-B patients. The postoperative CART model revealed lymphovascular invasion as the best postoperative predictor of OS among BCLC-0/A patients, whereas TBS remained the best predictor of long-term outcomes among BCLC-B patients in the postoperative setting. On multivariable analysis, pathologic TBS independently predicted worse OS among BCLC-0/A (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.07) and BCLC-B patients (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.19) undergoing resection.Prognostic stratification of patients undergoing resection for HCC within and beyond the BCLC resection criteria should include assessment of AFP and comorbidities for BCLC-0/A patients, as well as tumor burden for BCLC-B patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695662>Food-Specific Inhibitory Control Mediates the Effect of Disgust Sensitivity on  Mass Index.</a></h1><p>Disgust is an emotion that drives food avoidance. People vary in their responses to disgust, which is captured by their disgust sensitivity. Disgust sensitivity is clinically significant because it can influence eating behaviors, and indirectly people's  mass index (BMI). Inhibitory control can also influence BMI through the role that such reflective abilities play in governing food intake. In this study, we relied on neural models of disgust to suggest that disgust and inhibitory control are intertwined, and that inhibitory control facilitates the translation of disgust sensitivity into BMI. Mediation analyses applied to 46 subjects, including 29 normal  [BMI = 18.34 kg/m (SD = 1.58)] and 17 overweight/obese [BMI = 26.03 kg/m (SD = 2.58)] subjects, were used to test the hypothesis. Subjects completed the Chinese version of the Disgust Scale-Revised, and an inhibition control test (Food-Specific Stop-Signal Task). There were negative correlations between the disgust sensitivity score (DS) and  mass index (BMI), and between DS and stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). Moreover, BMI was positively correlated with SSRT. The mediation model results showed that disgust sensitivity was associated with BMI and that this relationship was mediated  inhibition control. There was no significant effect of DS on BMI, while the effect of SSRT on BMI was significant. This suggested that the effect of disgust sensitivity on BMI was fully mediated through food-specific inhibitory control. This supports our hypothesis that BMI is affected by disgust sensitivity and that this relationship is mediated by inhibition control. These findings reveal a key mechanism that underlies disgust sensitivity-BMI association and point to future research and potential interventions aimed at food intake management.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Li, Turel, Chen and He.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693950>Organophosphate di- and tri-esters in indoor and outdoor dust from China and its implications for human exposure.</a></h1><p>Organophosphate (OP) esters are emerging environmental contaminants, but little is known about their occurrence in dust. In this study, 19 OP triesters and their 11 diester degradation products were measured in indoor dust and outdoor dust collected from China. ∑OP triester concentrations in indoor dust (median: 2380 ng/g dry  [dw]) were an order of magnitude higher than those in outdoor dust (446 ng/g dw). The median concentrations of ∑OP diesters in indoor and outdoor dust were 260 and 96.8 ng/g dw, respectively. Dust samples collected from eastern and southern China contained higher concentrations of ∑OP di- and tri-esters than those from the other regions. Dust from the most urbanized areas in China including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou exhibited the highest concentrations of ∑OP di- (>1000 ng/g dw) and triesters (>4000 ng/g dw). We also found notable concentrations of emerging aryl-OP triesters in dust (3.85-10.6 ng/g dw). Significant correlations existed between the concentrations of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (BEHP) and tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP) (rho = 0.672-0.691, p < 0.01), as well as DPHP and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) (rho = 0.537-0.766, p < 0.01) in dust samples, indicating that OP diesters originated from the degradation of triesters. High molar concentration ratios of DEP to triethyl phosphate (TEP) and DPHP to TPHP/ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) suggested that these OP triesters degrade readily. Significant correlations were found between the concentrations of ∑OP di- (R = 0.390, p < 0.05) and tri-esters (R = 0.475, p < 0.01) in paired indoor-outdoor dust samples, which suggested that indoor dust was the source of OP esters to the outdoor environment. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of ∑OP diesters through dust ingestion was 0.21 ng/kg bw/d for adults and 2.59 ng/kg bw/d for children. The exposure levels of OP diesters, DEP and DPHP, were comparable to those of their parent triester compounds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The scarcity of efficient resistance sources within adapted germplasm is particularly alarming for DW, mainly utilized for human consumption, which is therefore at high risk of kernel contamination by health-dangerous mycotoxins (e.g., deoxynivalenol = DON). To cope with this scenario, we looked outside the wheat primary gene pool and recently transferred an exceptionally effective FHB resistance QTL () from  7EL chromosome arm onto a  7elL arm segment, containing additional valuable genes (including  for leaf rust resistance and  for yellow pigment content), distally inserted onto 7DL of BW lines. Two such lines were crossed with two previously developed DW- recombinants, having 7elL distal portions on 7AL arms. Genomic  hybridization (GISH) analysis showed homologous pairing, which is enabled by 7elL segments common to the BW and DW recombinant chromosomes, to occur with 42-78% frequency, depending on the shared 7elL amount. Aided by 7EL/7elL-linked markers, 7EL+7elL tetraploid recombinant types were isolated in BC progenies to DW of all cross combinations. Homozygous 7EL+7elL recombinant plants and null segregates selected in BCF progenies were challenged by  spike inoculation to verify the  efficacy in DW. Infection outcomes confirmed previous observations in BW, with >90% reduction of disease severity associated with  presence . its absence. The same differential effect was detected on seed set and  of inoculated spikes, with genotypes lacking  having ∼80% reduction compared with unaffected values of  carriers. In parallel, DON content in flour extracts of resistant recombinants averaged 0.67 ppm, a value >800 times lower than that of susceptible controls. Furthermore, as observed in BW, the same  also provided the novel DW recombinants with resistance to  crown rot (∼60% symptom reduction) as from seedling infection with . Through alien segment stacking, we succeeded in equipping DW with a very effective barrier against different  diseases and other positive attributes for crop security and safety.Copyright © 2019 Kuzmanović, Mandalà, Tundo, Ciorba, Frangella, Ruggeri, Rossini, Gevi, Rinalducci and Ceoloni.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695703>TCR Fingerprinting and Off-Target Peptide Identification.</a></h1><p>Adoptive T cell therapy using patient T cells redirected to recognize tumor-specific antigens by expressing genetically engineered high-affinity T-cell receptors (TCRs) has therapeutic potential for melanoma and other solid tumors. Clinical trials implementing genetically modified TCRs in melanoma patients have raised concerns regarding off-target toxicities resulting in lethal destruction of healthy tissue, highlighting the urgency of assessing which off-target peptides can be recognized by a TCR. As a model system we used the clinically efficacious NY-ESO-1-specific TCR C, which recognizes the peptide epitope SLLMWITQC presented by HLA-A02:01. We investigated which amino acids at each position enable a TCR interaction by sequentially replacing every amino acid position outside of anchor positions 2 and 9 with all 19 possible alternative amino acids, resulting in 134 peptides (133 altered peptides plus epitope peptide). Each peptide was individually evaluated using three different  assays: binding of the NY-ESO TCR to the peptide, peptide-dependent activation of TCR-expressing cells, and killing of peptide-presenting target cells. To represent the TCR recognition kernel, we defined Position  Matrices (PWMs) for each assay by assigning normalized measurements to each of the 20 amino acids in each position. To predict potential off-target peptides, we applied a novel algorithm projecting the PWM-defined kernel into the human proteome, scoring NY-ESO TCR recognition of 336,921 predicted human HLA-A02:01 binding 9-mer peptides. Of the 12 peptides with high predicted score, we confirmed 7 (including NY-ESO-1 antigen SLLMWITQC) strongly activate human primary NY-ESO-expressing T cells. These off-target peptides include peptides with up to 7 amino acid changes (of 9 possible), which could not be predicted using the recognition motif as determined by alanine scans. Thus, this replacement scan assay determines the "TCR fingerprint" and, when coupled with the algorithm applied to the database of human 9-mer peptides binding to HLA-A02:01, enables the identification of potential off-target antigens and the tissues where they are expressed. This platform enables both screening of multiple TCRs to identify the best candidate for clinical development and identification of TCR-specific cross-reactive peptide recognition and constitutes an improved methodology for the identification of potential off-target peptides presented on MHC class I molecules.Copyright © 2019 Karapetyan, Chaipan, Winkelbach, Wimberger, Jeong, Joshi, Stein, Underwood, Castle, van Dijk and Seibert.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691571>[Consumption of sugary drinks and sugar added to beverages and their relation ship with nutritional status in young people of Medellin (Colombia)].</a></h1><p>Worldwide, there is a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and young people, the etiology is multicausal and influences environmental, cultural and eating habits factors such as the consumption of sugary drinks and added sugar that promote excess  and risk of chronic diseases.To identify the relationship between the amount ingested of sugary drinks (BA) and added sugar (AA) with the nutritional status of young people.Cross sectional study, carried out in 596 individuals, between 10 and 18 years, the evaluation of dietary intake was made through Reminder 24 hours (R24H), for each of the individuals was considered the Best Linear Predictor Insleegue (MPLI) of energy,% AMDR of the total CHOS (acceptable range of distribution of macronutrients) and of the simple CHOS; the nutritional status was classified according to Z score of the  mass index (BMI) and percentage of  fat (% GC).

It is desirable but remains challenging to develop CNF electrode materials with a large specific surface area (SSA), high specific capacitance (SC) and high power density, as well as excellent cycling stability and high reliability. In this study, we synthesize the acrylonitrile-acrylic acid copolymer P(AN- co -AA) for the preparation of nitrogen-doped microporous CNFs. The thermal degradation of the AA segment leads to the formation of micropores that are distributed not only on the CNF surface but also inside the material. The microporous structure and nitrogen content can be manipulated at the molecular level by adjusting the  ratio between the AN and AA, and the SSA and SC could reach as high as 1099 m 2 g -1 and 156 F g -1 , respectively. After KOH activation, the Activated Carbon nanofiber (ACNF) possesses an extremely high SSA of 2117 m 2 g -1 and SC of 320 F g -1 , which are almost the highest values ever reported for electric double layer supercapacitors with an alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, the capacitance retention can be maintained at 99% even after 16,000 cyclic tests, exhibiting outstanding durability and repeatability.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We tested the hypothesis that the chemical composition as well as shape and size of particles in suspensions of natural origin affect the density and functional diversity of zooplankton. The suspensions were analyzed with atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical microscopy. Elements found in the beidellite clays were also identified in the mineral structure of the particles. As the size of the microparticles decreased, the  proportions of phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine increased in the suspensions. These conditions facilitated the biomass growth of large and small microphages and raptorials. As the size of the nanoparticles decreased, the shares of silicon, aluminum, iron, and magnesium increased. These conditions inhibited raptorials the most. Ecosystem functionality was the highest with intermediate suspension parameters, which were at the lower range of the microphase and the upper range of the nanophase.

Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was captured using a standardised maternal interview, completed 1 year after delivery on average.  of childhood (6-12 years of age) behaviour were obtained via mother- and teacher-report, using the Child Behaviour Checklist and Teacher Report Form. Linear and log-binomial models were used to calculate adjusted mean differences (MD) and risk ratios (RR), respectively and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for internalising, externalising, and total behaviour problems comparing acetaminophen users to non-users. Stabilized inverse probability  were used to account for loss to follow-up, and adjustments for indication were made.Approximately 60% (n = 354) of women reported use of acetaminophen during pregnancy. Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was associated with an increase in total behaviour problem score and risk of clinical behaviour problems according to mother report (MD 2.2, 95% CI 0.3, 4.1 and RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.99, 3.76) but not according to teacher report. Weighting to account for participation did not alter results, while adjustment for indications of acetaminophen use greatly attenuated the associations with mother-reported total behaviour problem score and risk of clinical behaviour problems (MD 0.1, 95% CI -2.1, 2.3 and RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.67, 2.58).Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was weakly associated with mother-reported behaviour problems and not associated with teacher-reported problems.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692631>Effects of ozone nano-bubble water on mucositis induced by cancer chemotherapy.</a></h1><p>No effective, reliable treatment for stomatitis associated with cancer therapy has been established. This study focused on the its effectiveness of ozone nano-bubble water (ONBW) for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis. Oral mucositis was induced in 14-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 21). The animals were randomly divided into 3 groups: 7 without treatment (control); 7 treated with physiological salt solution (saline); and 7 treated with ONBW. Animals were weighed on Days 7, 9, 11, and 16. Stomatitis grade evaluation and bacterial count measurements were performed before rinsing in all animals 3, 5, and 10 days after acetic acid irritation (Days 9, 11, and 17 respectively).  loss after stomatitis creation was observed in all groups, with significant differences between the control and ONBW groups and between the saline and ONBW groups on Day 16. The stomatitis grade did not worsen during the experimental period in any group, with the lowest grades in the ONBW group on Days 11 and 16. Significant differences were identified between the control and ONBW groups and between the saline and ONBW groups on Days 11 and 16. Oral bacterial counts tended to decrease over time in all three groups, with the greatest decrease in the ONBW group, followed by the saline group. The decrease in the bacterial count was steepest in the ONBW group. Rinsing out the oral cavity with ONBW decreased bacterial counts and encouraged the healing of oral chemotherapy-induced stomatitis. ONBW may be an effective treatment for chemotherapy-induced stomatitis.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693936>Plumbagin inhibits cancer stem-like cells, angiogenesis and suppresses cell proliferation and invasion by targeting Wnt/β-catenin pathway in endocrine resistant breast cancer.</a></h1><p>Fifty percent of advanced stage ER-positive breast cancer patients develop endocrine resistance. Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin is associated with stem-like phenotypes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process which confers resistance to endocrine therapy. Cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) can be a vital source of proangiogenic factors including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) which drives angiogenesis and leads to tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, targeting Wnt and FGF2 may provide effective treatment for endocrine resistant breast cancer. Our previous in vitro study reported that plumbagin (PLB) was a potent anticancer agent and was able to inhibit EMT in endocrine-resistant cells. This study aimed to further investigate the inhibitory effects of PLB on cancer stem-like phenotypes, tumorigenicity and angiogenesis. The results demonstrated Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated and was able to form mammospheres with increased cancer stem cell markers (ALDH1, NANOG, and OCT4) in endocrine-resistant cells. PLB significantly inhibited colony-forming, mammosphere formation and decreased cancer stem cell markers. The inhibitory effects of PLB on cell proliferation and invasion were mediated by Wnt signaling pathway. PLB also significantly reduced Wnt responsive genes and β-catenin. Moreover, PLB treatment at doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg/day inhibited tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis without any adverse effects on  and blood coagulation in orthotopic xenograft nude mice. In conclusion, PLB exerted anti-cancer activity and eliminated stem-like properties by attenuating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and FGF2 expression. These findings suggest that PLB could be a promising agent to treat endocrine resistant breast cancer.Copyright © 2019.

The efficacy and safety of dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody, approved for treatment in adolescent patients with inadequately controlled AD, remain unknown in this patient population.To assess the efficacy and safety of dupilumab monotherapy in adolescents with moderate to severe inadequately controlled AD.A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at 45 US and Canadian centers between March 21, 2017, and June 5, 2018. A total of 251 adolescents with moderate to severe AD inadequately controlled by topical medications or for whom topical therapy was inadvisable were included.Patients were randomized (1:1:1; interactive-response system; stratified by severity and ) to 16-week treatment with dupilumab, 200 mg (n = 43; baseline  <60 kg), or dupilumab, 300 mg (n = 39; baseline  ≥60 kg), every 2 weeks; dupilumab, 300 mg, every 4 weeks (n = 84); or placebo (n = 85).Proportion of patients with 75% or more improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) (scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating greater severity) and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0 or 1 on a 5-point scale (scores range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater severity) at week 16.A total of 251 patients were randomized (mean [SD] age, 14.5 [1.7] years; 148 [59.0%] male). Of 250 patients with data available on concurrent allergic conditions, most had comorbid type 2 diseases (asthma, 134 [53.6%]; food allergies, 60.8%; allergic rhinitis, 65.6%). A total of 240 patients (95.6%) completed the study. Dupilumab achieved both coprimary end points at week 16. The proportion of patients with EASI-75 improvement from baseline increased (every 2 weeks, 41.5%; every 4 weeks, 38.1%; placebo, 8.2%) with differences vs placebo of 33.2% (95% CI, 21.1%-45.4%) for every 2 weeks and 29.9% (95% CI, 17.9%-41.8%) for every 4 weeks (P < .001). Efficacy of the every-2-week regimen was generally superior to the every-4-week regimen. Patients in the dupilumab arms had higher percentage values of conjunctivitis (every 2 weeks, 9.8%; every 4 weeks, 10.8%; placebo, 4.7%) and injection-site reactions (every 2 weeks, 8.5%; every 4 weeks, 6.0%; placebo, 3.5%), and lower nonherpetic skin infections (every 2 weeks, 9.8%; every 4 weeks, 9.6%; placebo, 18.8%).In this study, dupilumab significantly improved AD signs, symptoms, and quality of life in adolescents with moderate to severe AD, with an acceptable safety profile.

In literature, it has been demonstrated that muscle activity during walking can be described via the activation of a small set of muscle synergies. The analysis of the composition and the time activation profiles of such synergies have been found to be a valid tool for the description of the motor control schemes in pathological subjects.In this study, we used muscle synergy analysis techniques to characterize the differences in the modular motor control schemes between a population of 14 people with trans-femoral amputation and 12 healthy subjects walking at two different (slow and normal self-selected) speeds. Muscle synergies were extracted from a 12 lower-limb muscles sEMG recording via non-negative matrix factorization. Equivalence of the synergy vectors was quantified by a cross-validation procedure, while differences in terms of time activation coefficients were evaluated through the analysis of the activity in the different gait sub-phases.Four synergies were able to reconstruct the muscle activity in all subjects. The spatial component of the synergy vectors did not change in all the analysed populations, while differences were present in the activity during the sound limb's stance phase. Main features of people with trans-femoral amputation's muscle synergy recruitment are a prolonged activation of the module composed of calf muscles and an additional activity of the hamstrings' module before and after the prosthetic heel strike.Synergy-based results highlight how, although the complexity and the spatial organization of motor control schemes are the same found in healthy subjects, substantial differences are present in the synergies' recruitment of people with trans femoral amputation. In particular, the most critical task during the gait cycle is the  transfer from the sound limb to the prosthetic one. Future studies will integrate these results with the dynamics of movement, aiming to a complete neuro-mechanical characterization of people with trans-femoral amputation's walking strategies that can be used to improve the rehabilitation therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694320>Older Adults' Awareness and Knowledge of Beans in Relation to Their Nutrient Content and Role in Chronic Disease Risk.</a></h1><p>Awareness and knowledge of nutrient-dense foods are important for older adults to help them make dietary choices that support a food-first approach to healthy aging. This is especially important since age is a major risk factor for chronic disease and the proportion of older adults in North America is increasing. Beans can contribute to a food-first approach to healthy aging as they are nutrient-dense and can reduce the risk of chronic diseases. However, studies exploring awareness and knowledge of beans in older adults are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore older adults' awareness of beans in relation to their nutrient content and role in chronic disease risk. Community-dwelling older adults (≥65 years old) were recruited and completed a validated researcher-administered questionnaire ( = 250), which was followed by 10 focus groups ( = 49). Results showed that the majority of older adults considered beans as a healthy food and thought consuming them could improve their health (99.2% and 98.0%, respectively); however, only 51.2% were bean consumers. While the majority (83.6%) of older adults were aware that a serving of beans is high in dietary fibre, bean consumers were significantly more likely to think that consuming beans could improve health areas related to dietary fibre including  management and constipation. Furthermore, most (84.8%) older adults thought consuming beans could improve heart health; however, bean consumers were significantly more likely to be aware that one serving of beans is low in nutrients relevant to heart health including total fat, saturated and  fat as well as cholesterol. This research can help to inform healthcare professionals and public health agencies to create specific dietary strategies focusing on increasing older adults' awareness and knowledge of beans in relation to their nutrient profile and role in promoting health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691503>Effect of dietary tryptophan supplementation on growth performance, immune response and anti-oxidant status of broiler chickens from 7 to 21 days.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to investigate the optimum dietary level of tryptophan (Trp) supplementation at which broiler chickens have better growth with efficient immune system and anti-oxidant status.One hundred and twenty (n = 120) 1-day-old broiler chicks were fed a common commercial diet from days 1 to 7. On day 7, the chicks were randomly divided in three treatment groups, that is, Trp 0.2 [national research council (NRC) recommended level of tryptophan], Trp 0.3 (tryptophan supplemented at 0.3%) and Trp 0.5 (tryptophan supplemented at 0.5%). All the experimental diets were iso-caloric (ME; 3,000 kcal/kg) and iso-proteic (CP; 18.5%). Weekly data on feed intake and  gain (BWG) were recorded to calculate feed conversion ratio (FCR). On day 19, avian tuberculin was injected to note the cellular immunity. On day 21, two birds per replicate were killed to determine carcass and visceral organ . Blood serum samples were collected for analysis of humoral immune response against sheep red blood cells, total oxidant and anti-oxidants by spectrophotometric method.Feed intake, carcass and visceral organ  remained unaffected by dietary treatments while BWG and FCR tended to improve (p < .05) in broiler chicks fed the Trp 0.3 and the Trp 0.5 diets. Total oxidant status was also improved (p < .05) in broiler chicks fed the Trp 0.5 diet. Likewise, broiler chicks fed the Trp 0.3 and the Trp 0.5 diets tended to have better (p < .05) total anti-oxidant status, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and arylesterase (ARE). The overall antibodies response and IgG improved (p < .05) by the Trp 0.3 and Trp 0.5 diets compared to control. However, IgM level remained similar across the treatment. The cellular immunity against avian tuberculin improved at 24 hr post-injection but its effect disappeared at 48 hr.The results of present study revealed that Trp above the NRC recommended level may give better growth, immune response and anti-oxidant status in broiler chickens.© 2019 The Authors.

In this study, the specific regulatory role of lncRNA ezrin antisense RNA 1 (EZR-AS1) on CRC was investigated. The expression of LncRNA EZR-AS1 was significantly up-regulated in CRC cell lines (HCT8, HCT116, HT29 and SW620 cells), which was significantly different from that of normal human fetal colonic mucosa cells (FHC cells) (P &lt; 0.01). HCT116 and HT29 cells were then transfected with EZR-AS1 shRNA (sh-EZR-AS1) to silence lncRNA EZR-AS1 (P &lt; 0.01).When compared with the Control, after transfection of SH-EZR-AS1, E-cadherin was up-regulated, Vimentin was down-regulated, the apoptosis rate was increased, the cell viability, wound healing rate, and the number of invasive cells were decreased in HCT116 and HT29 cells (P &lt; 0.05). Silencing of lncRNA EZR-AS also significantly reduced the tumor volume and  in mice injected with sh-EZR-AS1-transfectedHCT116 and HT29 cells (P &lt; 0.05). The regulatory relationship between lncRNA EZR-AS1 and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling was further identified in CRC cells. Silencing of lncRNA EZR-AS1 significantly down-regulated TGF-β, Smad2, and α-SMA expression in HCT116 and HT29 cells at the protein level (P &lt; 0.05). The intervention of SB431542 (a TGF-β receptor blocker) and silencing of Smad2 both significantly down-regulated lncRNA EZR-AS1 expression in HCT116 and HT29 cells (P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, silencing of lncRNA EZR-AS1 inhibited the proliferation, invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and promoted the apoptosis of CRC cells through blocking TGF-β signaling.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696324>Quality of life in chronic conditions using patient-reported  and biomarkers: a DEA analysis in type 1 diabetes.</a></h1><p>A chronic disease impacts a patient's daily life, with the burden of symptoms and managing the condition, and concerns of progression and disease complications. Such aspects are captured by Patient-Reported Outcomes  (PROM), assessments of e.g. wellbeing. Patient-Reported Experience  (PREM) assess patients' experiences of healthcare and address patient preferences. Biomarkers are useful for monitoring disease activity and treatment effect and determining risks of progression and complications, and they provide information on current and future health. Individuals may differ in which among these aspects they consider important. We aimed to develop a measure of quality of life using biomarkers, PROM and PREM, that would provide an unambiguous ranking of individuals, without presuming any specific set of importance . We anticipated it would be useful for studying needs and room for improvement, estimating the effects of interventions and comparing alternatives, and for developing healthcare with a broad focus on the individual. We wished to examine if efficiency analysis could be used for this purpose, in an application to individuals with type 1 diabetes.We used PROM and PREM data linked to registry data on risk factors, in a large sample selected from the National Diabetes Registry in Sweden. Efficiency analysis appears useful for evaluating the situation of individuals with type 1 diabetes. Quality of life was estimated as efficiency, which differed by age. The contribution of different components to quality of life was heterogeneous, and differed by gender, age and duration of diabetes. Observed quality of life shortfall was mainly due to inefficiency, and to some extent due to the level of available inputs.The efficiency analysis approach can use patient-reported outcomes , patient-reported experience  and comorbidity risk factors to estimate quality of life with a broad focus on the individual, in individuals with type 1 diabetes. The approach enables ranking and comparisons using all these aspects in parallel, and allows each individual to express their own view of which aspects are important to them. The approach can be used for policy regarding interventions on inefficiency as well as healthcare resource allocation, although currently limited to type 1 diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693504>Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of  Loss, Comorbidities, and Biochemical Outcomes From Randomized Controlled Trials.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to compare  loss, obesity-related comorbidities, and biochemical outcomes of LSG versus LRYGB through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).LSG and LRYGB are the 2 most commonly performed bariatric surgeries for the treatment of obesity. The comparative outcomes of the 2 surgeries is a topic of ongoing debate and medium-term outcomes remain uncertain.A search for RCTs comparing LRYGB versus LSG was conducted. Pooled outcomes between 2 procedures were compared using pairwise random-effects meta-analysis at 1, 3, and 5-year follow-up time points. Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation was used to assess certainty of evidence.Thirty-three studies involving 2475 patients were included. LRYGB resulted in greater loss of  mass index compared to LSG at 1 year [mean difference -1.25 kg/m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.01 to -0.49, P = 0.001; moderate certainty of evidence] which persisted at 3 years, but there was insufficient evidence at 5 years.

In this study, a sleep-deprived rat model was used to evaluate the protective effects of round scad hydrolysates (RSH, 333 and 666 mg per kg bw) on memory impairment and the underlying mechanisms. The result of the Morris water maze test revealed that RSH significantly reversed the cognition deficits induced by sleep deprivation. Moreover, RSH supplementation alleviated oxidative stress by increasing the activities of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase and the ratio of glutathione/oxidized glutathione in the brain. Furthermore, RSH significantly up-regulated the expression of antioxidant defense-related proteins, including nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), as well as the phosphorylation of Akt in rats. Moreover, RSH improved the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding (CREB) and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) in vivo, indicating that RSH can also promote the expression of proteins related to the neurotrophic pathway. Additionally, UPLC-qTOF-MS/MS was further used to identify the peptides in RSH. The results indicated that RSH mainly consists of low molecular  peptides with hydrophobic, aromatic and positively charged amino acids in sequence. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that RSH exerts memory-improving actions by regulating the antioxidant and neurotrophic pathways, and RSH can be a potential functional ingredient for the prevention and protection of cognitive deficits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696087>Comparing serum concentration of spexin among patients with metabolic syndrome, healthy overweight/obese, and normal- individuals.</a></h1><p> There are many factors related to etiology of metabolic syndrome (MetS) including obesity.

The study groups were all matched for age and sex and included overweight/obese individuals with MetS and 2 control groups without MetS (including -matched and normal- participants).  composition and serum concentration of spexin and leptin were measured.  Serum leptin and spexin levels were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in normal- compared to overweight/obese groups with/without MetS (p< 0.02). No significant difference was observed in serum leptin and spexin concentrations between the overweight/obese groups with/without MetS (p≥ 0.05). Also, spexin, with cutoff value of 4.6, had 78% sensitivity and 82% specificity for diagnosing overweight/obese from normal- participants.

By intravenous anesthesia, the transplantation of autologous peritoneum for bladder reconstruction operation was carried out by transplanting the peritoneum onto an ileum segment which mucosa and submucosa had been removed. These flaps were used to mend and reconstruct the neobladder by suturing with edge of the detective bladder. After removal of ureteral catheters and balloon catheter at day 5 and day 7 respectively, voiding behavior was monitored, and animals were euthanized at week 12 for routine pathology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopic examinations.  Six porcines underwent reconstruction, but no one lost to complications such as peritonitis, ileus and urinary fistula. Voiding behavior was normal, and urine was clear in all animals after removal of catheters. At autopsy, reconstructed bladders were healthy. Pathological examination showed the part of reconstruction had been covered by continuous urothelium while the peritoneum disappeared and showed no ileal mucosa regrowth and residual. Scanning electron microscope showed that the transitional cells of neobladder were complete and orderly, and urothelium around suture border was continuous and no malposition.

Thus, the effect of a candidate substance, dansameum (DSE), using an in vitro and NAFLD mouse model (that is, apolipoprotein E-Knockout mice), were investigated. The molecular pathways for lipogenesis and inflammation were evaluated using Nile staining, Western blotting, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. It was shown that DSE significantly ameliorated the production of lipogenesis-related factors, including liver X receptor-α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and CD36. In addition, DSE significantly reduced the production of inflammation factors, including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and nuclear factor kappa B. Furthermore, DSE significantly reduced the phosphorylation of c-Jun amino terminal kinase. Taken together, this suggests that DSE may be a functional food candidate for regulating NAFLD, based on its effects.© The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692747>Primary jejunal melanoma as a cause of adult intussusception: a case report and review of literature.</a></h1><p>Primary melanoma of the small bowel is a rare clinical entity with a paucity of published reports in literature.

Central obesity was determined using waist circumference, waist to hip ratio, visceral fat thickness, and subcutaneous fat thickness. General obesity was determined using  mass index (BMI).: About 20.0% of participants in the study had general obesity. The prevalence of central obesity as measured by waist circumference was 52.0%, by waist-to-hip ratio was 53.5%, by visceral fat thickness was 32.4% and by subcutaneous fat thickness was 49.2%. The prevalence of normal- central obesity in the study population was highest when measured by waist to hip ratio (38.1%) and lowest when measured by visceral fat thickness (18.1%).

The primary end point was change from baseline in HbA for each dose of RVT-1502 compared with placebo. Secondary end points included change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and safety assessments.Over 12 weeks, RVT-1502 significantly reduced HbA relative to placebo by 0.74%, 0.76%, and 1.05% in the 5-, 10-, and 15-mg groups ( < 0.001), respectively, and FPG decreased by 2.1, 2.2, and 2.6 mmol/L ( < 0.001). The proportions of subjects achieving an HbA <7.0% were 19.5%, 39.5%, 39.5%, and 45.0% with placebo and RVT-1502 5, 10, and 15 mg ( ≤ 0.02 vs. placebo). The frequency of hypoglycemia was low, and no episodes were severe. Mild increases in mean aminotransferase levels remaining below the upper limit of normal were observed with RVT-1502 but were reversible and did not appear to be dose related, with no other liver parameter changes.  and lipid changes were similar between RVT-1502 and placebo. RVT-1502-associated mild increases in blood pressure were not dose related or consistent across time.Glucagon receptor antagonism with RVT-1502 significantly lowers HbA and FPG, with a safety profile that supports further clinical development with longer-duration studies ().© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692380>Association Between  Gene Polymorphisms and Adverse Effects of Antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder.</a></h1><p> Circadian rhythm genes including  () are associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and have an effect on the patient's response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. The aim of this study was to identify possible associations between three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of  (rs10746473, rs228697, and rs228729), the MDD symptoms, and adverse effects of SSRIs.  A total of 600 MDD patients who had been treated with SSRIs were enrolled. The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) was used to evaluate symptoms and treatment efficacy. In addition, the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale/UKU Consumer Satisfaction Rating Scale (TESS/UKU) was used to assess adverse effects. The  locus was genotyped by PCR and DNA sequencing.  The  rs228697 CC genotype was associated with a higher sleep factor score when compared with the CG genotype ( = 4.027,  = 0.046). In addition, the rs228729 TC genotype was associated with a greater risk of suffering from excitement/agitation ( = 0.002, OR [odds ratio] = 4.049), akathisia ( = 0.014, OR = 4.905) and  loss ( = 0.041, OR = 2.287) when compared with the CC genotype.

In all, 16 weanling piglets with an average initial  of 7.5 kg were divided into two groups. One group was fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet, and the other was fed a rice-soybean meal diet, containing around 46% of corn or rice, respectively. A two-week growth trial was conducted. The average daily gain (p = .025) and feed efficiency (p = .011) in rice-fed piglets were significantly higher than those in corn-fed piglets. Liver lysine-ketoglutarate reductase activity tended to be lower (p = .073) in rice-fed piglets than in corn-fed piglets. Plasma urea nitrogen concentration in rice-fed piglets was significantly lower than that in corn-fed piglets. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were significantly higher in rice-fed piglets than in corn-fed piglets. Plasma-free valine, isoleucine, and tryptophan concentrations were significantly higher in rice-fed piglets than in corn-fed piglets. In contrast, plasma histidine concentration was significantly lower in rice-fed piglets than in corn-fed piglets. Overall, these results show that rice feeding improves the growth performance and affects the protein (amino acids) metabolism in weanling piglets.© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692800>Neonatal pharmacology and clinical implications.</a></h1><p>During the neonatal period, there is physiological immaturity of organs, systems and metabolic pathways that influences the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of administered drugs, the dosage of which should be constantly amended, considering the progressive increase in  and the maturation of the elimination pathways.

Reasons for this variability are unclear and may be influenced by genes that regulate iron metabolism. We evaluated the association of the copy number of the glutathione S-transferase M1 () gene and degree of iron overload among patients with SCA. We compared LIC in 38 children with SCA and ≥12 lifetime erythrocyte transfusions stratified by  genotype. Baseline LIC was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), R2*MRI within 3 months prior to, and again after, starting iron unloading therapy.

However, experimental datasets in the polymer-science field are typically limited and they are expensive to build. Their size (< 100 samples) limits the development of chemical intuition from experimentalists, as it constrains the use of machine-learning algorithms for extracting relevant information. We tackle this issue to predict and optimize adhesive materials by combining laboratory experimental design, an active learning pipeline and Bayesian optimization. We start from an initial dataset of 32 adhesive samples that were prepared from various molecular- bisphenol A-based epoxy resins and polyetheramine curing agents, mixing ratios and curing temperatures, and our data-driven method allows us to propose an optimal preparation of an adhesive material with a very high adhesive joint strength measured at 35.8 ± 1.1 MPa after three active learning cycles (five proposed preparations per cycle). A Gradient boosting machine learning model was used for the successive prediction of the adhesive joint strength in the active learning pipeline, and the model achieved a respectable accuracy with a coefficient of determination, root mean square error and mean absolute error of 0.85, 4.0 MPa and 3.0 MPa, respectively. This study demonstrates the important impact of active learning to accelerate the design and development of tailored highly functional materials from very small datasets.© 2019 The Author(s).

Acylated ghrelin (AG) and desacylated ghrelin (DAG) are the two main forms of ghrelin, which have opposing roles in energy homeostasis. The AG/DAG ratio has been proposed to be associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the general population. This study compared the relationships between MetS and ghrelin parameters in patients with schizophrenia.Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and under olanzapine monotherapy were recruited. Fasting blood samples were collected for the analyses of metabolic and ghrelin parameters. The serum levels of total ghrelin and AG were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. DAG level was calculated by subtracting the AG level from the total ghrelin level.We recruited 151 subjects with schizophrenia, and classified them into those with MetS ( = 41) and those without MetS ( = 110). Subjects with MetS had a significantly higher AG/DAG ratio, as well as lower total ghrelin and DAG levels. There were no sex differences in ghrelin parameters. The AG/DAG ratio was significantly and positively correlated with ,  mass index, waist circumference, insulin level, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and number of MetS components. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the number of MetS components remained significantly associated with the AG/DAG ratio.Our results revealed that lower AG/DAG ratios were associated with better metabolic profiles in olanzapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. These observations suggest that the balance between AG and DAG plays a crucial role in the metabolic homeostasis among patients with schizophrenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695429>Overexpression Of ERβ Participates In The Progression Of Liver Cancer Via Inhibiting The Notch Signaling Pathway.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to explore the role of Estrogen Receptor-β (ERβ)-mediated Notch signaling pathway in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis in liver cancer cells.HepG2 cells (Pbi-EGFP-ER) were transfected with ERβ that mediated by liposome, and normal HepG2 cells (Blank) and empty plasmid-transfected HepG2 cells (Pbi-EGFP-C) were used as controls. Then, Huh7 cells were transfected with shERβ lentivirus to knock down ERβ expression. The Huh7 cells were divided into three groups including Blank, experimental group (shERβ) and negative group (shLuc). Then, qRT-PCR, Western blot, CCK-8 assay, cell scratch assay, Transwell assay, Annexin V-FITC and PI double staining were performed based on these groups. Finally, a mouse xenograft model was constructed to verify the regulation of ERβ on Notch signaling pathway in liver cancer.In HepG2 cells, the ERβ expression in Pbi-EGFP-E group was higher than that in Blank and Bi-EGFP-C group. Overexpression of ERβ inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation, migration, invasion and Ki67 protein expression, as well as promoted apoptosis, Bcl-2 and Bax expression. Overexpression of ERβ decreased Notch1, Notch2 and Hes1 expression. In Huh7 cells, the effect of low ERβ expression was contrary to that of high ERβ expression. The shERβ + DAPT group reversed the effect of shERβ on the volume and  of transplanted tumors.ERβ may inhibit the development of liver cancer and promote apoptosis via inhibiting the Notch pathway.© 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691465>Psychological stress reduces the immunological benefits of breast milk.</a></h1><p>Our study aimed to assess the impact of maternal psychological stress on the immunological components of breast milk. Eighty-nine women participated in the study. We assessed general stress, postpartum specific stress, negative affectivity, salivary cortisol of mother and sIgA levels of breast milk 4-6 weeks after delivery. Controlling for the effects of women's age, , number and duration of feedings postpartum, specific stress was related to reduced sIgA concentration (R = .206, Beta = -.275, p = .020). This study suggests that the established link between psychological stress and immunity may also extend to the immunity of the newborn by reducing the immunological benefits of breast milk. It also suggests that breastfeeding might be a potential mechanism of the relationship between maternal stress and the health of the offspring. Findings highlight the need for interventions addressing women during the postpartum period, in order to ensure the mother' s well-being and the infant' s optimal development.This article is protected by copyright.

Despite frequent use of vancomycin in the IHD setting, there is variability in dosing and monitoring practices among clinicians at the study institution. There is also a paucity of evidence regarding optimal vancomycin dosing to achieve target pre-IHD serum concentration.The primary objective was to compare the percentage of treatment courses with a serum vancomycin concentration between 15 and 20 mg/L, measured before the third IHD session, before and after implementation of a  threshold-based dosing protocol. The secondary objectives were to compare the percentage of treatment courses with a pre-third IHD vancomycin concentration between 10 and 22 mg/L and the number of vancomycin measurements per treatment day, before and after protocol implementation.This quasi-experimental, single-centre study included inpatients and outpatients who underwent IHD and received at least 2 IV doses of vancomycin, with vancomycin being measured in an appropriately drawn sample before the third IHD session. Before protocol implementation, vancomycin dosing was at the clinician's discretion (usual care).

We explored the differences of the transcriptome in exfoliated epithelial intestinal cells (EEIC) of preterm infants receiving full feed with OMM or DHM.The prospective observational study included preterm infants ≤ 32 weeks' gestation and/or ≤1500 g birthweight. Total RNA from EEIC were processed for genome-wide expression analysis.Principal component analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed two clustered groups corresponding to the OMM and DHM groups that showed differences in the gene expression profile in 1629 transcripts. The OMM group overexpressed lactalbumin alpha gene (), Cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene () and caseins kappa gene (), beta gene () and alpha gene () and underexpressed Neutrophil Cytosolic Factor 1 gene () compared to the DHM group.The transcriptomic analysis of EEIC showed that OMM induced a differential expression of specific genes that may contribute to a more efficient response to a pro-oxidant challenge early in the postnatal period when preterm infants are at a higher risk of oxidative stress.

Despite the occurrence of diverse therapies in recent years, the survival rate of patients with high-risk NB is still unpredictable due to the high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Therefore, it is urgent to study the molecular mechanism of NB metastasis. SNHG1 has been reported to be closely related to the development, metastasis, and prognosis of many cancers. The purpose of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanism of the role of SNHG1 in NB tumors.The expression levels of SNHG1, miR-338-3p, and PLK4 were detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The functional targets between miR-338-3p and SNHG1 or PLK4 were predicted by online software Diana tools and observed by Luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Cell migration and invasion were operated through flow cytometry. The expression of p-AKT was quantified by Western blot. Xenograft tumor model was established to confirm the biological role of SNHG1 in NB in vivo.The expression levels of SNHG1 and PLK4 were increased in NB tissues and cells, and miR-338-3p expression was on the contrary. PLK4 was verified as a direct target of miR-338-3p and miR-338-3p could specially bind to SNHG1. The negative effect of SNHG1 down-regulation on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion could be rescued by miR-338-3p inhibition. The suppression of miR-338-3p mimics on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion could be reversed by PLK4 overexpression. In addition, SNHG1 knockdown weakened the volume and  of tumor in vivo.SNHG1 conduced to tumorigenesis and mechanism by upregulating PLK4 and by acting as miR-338-3p sponge in neuroblastoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692620>Peripheral cranial neuropathies consistent with cavernous sinus syndrome caused by extracranial nasopharyngeal lymphoma in a cat.</a></h1><p>Cavernous sinus syndrome is a unique constellation of cranial nerve deficits occurring typically as a result of pathologic infiltration of the cavernous sinus, which is located in the lateral sellar compartment of the calvarium.

Moreover, observing salient motor errors during object lifting allows individuals to update their internal sensorimotor representation about object . Embodying observed visuomotor cues for the planning of a motor command further enables individuals to accurately scale their fingertip forces when subsequently lifting the same object. However, it is still unknown whether the observation of a skilled lift is equally able to mediate predictive motor control in the observer. Here, we tested this hypothesis by asking participants to grasp and lift a manipulandum after observing an actor's lift. The object  changed unpredictably (light or heavy) every fourth to sixth trial performed by the actor. Participants were informed that they would always lift the same  as the actor and that, based on the experimental condition, they would have to observe skilled or erroneously performed lifts. Our results revealed that the observation of both skilled and erroneously performed lifts allows participants to update their internal sensorimotor object representation, in turn enabling them to predict force scaling accurately. These findings suggest that the observation of salient motor errors, as well as subtle features of skilled motor performance, are embodied in the observer's motor repertoire and can drive changes in predictive motor control.Copyright © 2019 Rens and Davare.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692387>Determination of Nutrition and Physical Activity Status of Early Adolescents in Secondary Schools in Anatolian Side of Istanbul.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to determine the nutritional and physical activity statuses of adolescents and to examine the relationship between their nutritional and physical activity levels and anthropometric measurements.

Inadequate total GWG was associated with lower infant  and length outcomes (ß range for z-scores = -0.21 to -0.46, p < 0.05) and lower risk of LGA (adjusted Relative Risk, aRR = 0.38; 95% confidence intervals, CI: 0.16, 0.95) and rapid  gain (aRR = 0.72; 95%CI: 0.51, 1.00). GWG rates above recommendations in the 2 trimester or 2 /3 trimesters were associated with greater  outcomes at birth and 6 months (ß range for z-scores = 0.24 to 0.35, p < 0.05).Counseling women about health behaviors and closely monitoring GWG beginning in early pregnancy is necessary, particularly among populations at high-risk of obesity.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696081>Risk factors of neonatal mortality in Iran: a systematic review.</a></h1><p> Reducing neonatal mortality is an important measure to reduce the overall under-five-years' mortality. Identifying the risk factors is the first step in this regard. This study performed with the aim of determining the risk factors of the neonatal mortality in Iran.  Databases of SID, MagIran, IranMedex, IronDoc and Google Scholar for the Persian resources and Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, Ovid, EMBASE, ISI web of science and Cochrane for English resources were searched up to January 2017. The inclusion criteria were the studies analyzing at least one risk factor for neonatal mortality in Iran with a control group and multivariate regression analysis. Eight papers met the inclusion criteria. The risk factors were extracted and tabulated.  Of the 1713 records retrieved, 8 were eligible to include in the analysis. Preterm birth, low birth , smoking and addiction, and anomaly were the important risk factors of neonatal mortality in Iran. Moreover, an extended list of potential risk factors identified on most of which the evidence was controversial and insufficient. The factors categorized into modifiable and identifiable ones.  On the modifiable risk factors, proper intervention, and on the non-modifiable ones, early detection and special care may be helpful in preventing the babies from death. Population-based studies with large sample size and multivariate analysis are needed to make clear the effect size of the identified risk factors.© 2019 Iran University of Medical Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693847>Post-operative Physical Performance Factors Associated With Gait Speed in Patients Surgically Treated for Hip Fracture: A Cross-Sectional Study.</a></h1><p>To determine post-operative physical performance factors associated with gait speed in patients surgically treated for hip fracture.Cross-sectional data from 59 patients (16 males and 43 females; mean age, 79.2±9.1 years) who underwent hip fracture surgery were enrolled. Patients completed a 10-meter walk test (10MWT) to assess gait speed. Additional physical performance tests included the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the knee extensors and flexors on the operated and non-operated sides as well as of the hip abductors (all tested using air-resistance  machines), and analysis of spatio-temporal gait parameters at about 6 weeks after hip surgery.Bivariate analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between the post-operative 10MWT and the post-operative TUG, age, swing phase duration, and gait cycle duration along with a significant negative correlation between post-operative BBS score, MVIC of the knee extensors and flexors on the operated and non-operated sides, MVIC of the hip abductors, and cadence and stance phase duration. Linear regression analyses revealed that the post-operative TUG (β=0.85, p<0.01), gait cycle duration (β=0.17, p=0.02), and osteoporosis (β=-0.18, p=0.02) were associated with the post-operative 10MWT.The presence of osteoporosis, post-operative balance, and isometric muscle strength in the operated and non-operated legs were statistically associated with post-operative gait speed early after hip fracture surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696042>Improved lipid production in oleaginous brackish diatom  MACC8 using two-stage cultivation approach.</a></h1><p>A two-stage cultivation method involving the initial growth in optimized conditions for biomass production followed by those for lipid production in oleaginous brackish diatom  MACC8 resulted in a proportional increase of lipid concentration along with biomass production. The diatom was further subjected to stress conditions by altering the nutrient components such as nitrate, phosphate, silicate, and temperature. Silicon deprivation resulted in the highest lipid percentage of 28.78% of  at the end of the 18th day of the second stage. A significant increase in lipid content was observed on the complete removal of the nutrients silicon and urea one at a time, while the biomass showed a considerable reduction. The application of multiple nutrient stress conditions had a profound influence on the increased rate of lipid production. A combination of phosphate deprivation, silicate limitation and temperature reduction resulted in a significant increase in lipid percentage of 32.13% at the cost of reduced biomass (1.1 g L), whereas phosphate deprivation, urea limitation, and temperature reduction resulted in lipid percentage of 27.58% with a biomass of 1.44 g L at the end of the second stage. Further, the results were supported by Nile red staining, FTIR, fatty acid profile and oxidative stress marker analyses. The changes in biochemical composition and oxidative stress parameters within the various stress conditions demonstrated the profound influence of the selected stress factors on the biodiesel productivity of the diatom, besides its stress tolerance. A two-phase culturing system, with multifactor stress application, especially nitrogen limitation along with phosphate starvation and temperature stress, would be the suitable method for gaining maximum biomass productivity and lipid content in diatom  MACC8 towards biofuel production.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692782>Sesamol intervention ameliorates obesity-associated metabolic disorders by regulating hepatic lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>Obesity has currently become a serious social problem to be solved. Sesamol, a natural bioactive substance extracted from sesame oil, has shown multiple physiological functions, and it might have an effect on the treatment of obesity.This study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of sesamol on the treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.C57BL/6J male mice were fed HFD for 8 weeks to induce obesity, followed by supplementation with sesamol (100 mg/kg  [b.w.]/day [d] by gavage) for another 4 weeks. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe lipid accumulation in adipose tissues and liver. Chemistry reagent kits were used to measure serum lipids, hepatic lipids, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. ELISA kits were used to determine the serum insulin and free fatty acid (FFA) levels. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels involved in lipid metabolism in the liver.Sesamol significantly reduced the  gain of obese mice and suppressed lipid accumulation in adipose tissue and liver. Sesamol also improved serum and hepatic lipid profiles, and increased insulin sensitivity. In the sesamol-treated group, the levels of serum ALT and AST decreased significantly. Furthermore, after sesamol treatment, the hepatic sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1c) decreased, while the phosphorylated hormone sensitive lipase (p-HSL), the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α (CPT1α), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC1α) increased, which were responsible for the fatty acid synthesis, lipolysis, and fatty acid β-oxidation, respectively.Sesamol had a positive effect on anti-obesity and ameliorated the metabolic disorders of obese mice. The possible mechanism of sesamol might be the regulation of lipid metabolism in the liver.© 2019 Hong Qin et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694668>Synthetic surfactant with a recombinant surfactant protein C analogue improves lung function and attenuates inflammation in a model of acute respiratory distress syndrome in adult rabbits.</a></h1><p>In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) damaged alveolar epithelium, leakage of plasma proteins into the alveolar space and inactivation of pulmonary surfactant lead to respiratory dysfunction. Lung function could potentially be restored with exogenous surfactant therapy, but clinical trials have so far been disappointing. These negative results may be explained by inactivation and/or too low doses of the administered surfactant. Surfactant based on a recombinant surfactant protein C analogue (rSP-C33Leu) is easy to produce and in this study we compared its effects on lung function and inflammation with a commercial surfactant preparation in an adult rabbit model of ARDS.ARDS was induced in adult New Zealand rabbits by mild lung-lavages followed by injurious ventilation (V 20 m/kg ) until P/F ratio < 26.7 kPa. The animals were treated with two intratracheal boluses of 2.5 mL/kg of 2% rSP-C33Leu in DPPC/egg PC/POPG, 50:40:10 or poractant alfa (Curosurf®), both surfactants containing 80 mg phospholipids/mL, or air as control. The animals were subsequently ventilated (V 8-9 m/kg ) for an additional 3 h and lung function parameters were recorded. Histological appearance of the lungs, degree of lung oedema and levels of the cytokines TNFα IL-6 and IL-8 in lung homogenates were evaluated.Both surfactant preparations improved lung function vs. the control group and also reduced inflammation scores, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and formation of lung oedema to similar degrees. Poractant alfa improved compliance at 1 h, P/F ratio and PaO at 1.5 h compared to rSP-C33Leu surfactant.This study indicates that treatment of experimental ARDS with synthetic lung surfactant based on rSP-C33Leu improves lung function and attenuates inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693926>Vaporized perfluorocarbon inhalation attenuates primary blast lung injury in canines by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor-κB activation and inducing nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 pathway.</a></h1><p>Blast lung injury is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Vaporized perfluorocarbon (PFC) inhalation has been reported to attenuate acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans and animal models. However, the effect of vaporized PFC on blast lung injury is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the protective effects and potential underlying mechanisms of action of vaporized PFC on blast lung injury in a canine model. This was a prospective, controlled, animal study in adult male hybrid dogs randomized to sham, blast (B), blast plus mechanical ventilation (B + M), and blast plus PFC (B + P) groups. All groups except for the sham were exposed to blast wave. The B + P group was treated with vaporized PFC for 1.5 h followed by 5.5 h mechanical ventilation. B + M group received 7.5 h mechanical ventilation and B group was observed for 7.5 h. Blast lung injury was induced using a shock tube. Blood gas, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress were measured. Expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (Nrf2) were measured using western blot. Lung injury observed after blast exposure was marked by increased histopathological scores, ratio of lung wet to dry . PFC treatment attenuated blast lung injury as indicated by histopathological scores and ratio of lung wet to dry . PFC treatment downregulated interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and malondialdehyde (MDA), and upregulated superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. PFC also suppressed expression of MAPK/NF-κB and Nrf2 protein levels. Our results suggest that PFC attenuated blast-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting MAPK/NF-κB activation and inducing Nrf2 expression in dogs.Copyright © 2019.

Lettuce ( L.) is sensitive to salinity, which reduces plant biomass, and causes leaf burn and early senescence. We sought to identify physiological traits important in salt tolerance that allows lettuce adaptation to high salinity while maintaining its productivity. Based on previous salinity tolerance studies, one sensitive and one tolerant genotype each was selected from crisphead, butterhead, and romaine, as well as leaf types of cultivated lettuce and its wild relative,  L. Physiological parameters were measured four weeks after transplanting two-day old seedlings into 350 mL volume pots filled with sand, hydrated with Hoagland nutrient solution and grown in a growth chamber. Salinity treatment consisted of gradually increasing concentrations of NaCl and CaCl from 0 mM/0 mM at the time of transplanting, to 30 mM/15 mM at the beginning of week three, and maintaining it until harvest. Across the 10 genotypes, leaf area and fresh  decreased 0-64% and 16-67%, respectively, under salinity compared to the control. Salinity stress increased the chlorophyll index by 4-26% in the cultivated genotypes, while decreasing it by 5-14% in the two wild accessions. Tolerant lines less affected by elevated salinity were characterized by high values of the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters Fv/Fm and instantaneous photosystem II quantum yield (QY), and lower leaf transpiration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692638>Efficacy of fenbendazole and ivermectin in treating gastrointestinal nematode infections in an Ontario cow-calf herd.</a></h1><p>The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to compare performance of cow-calf pairs in southern Ontario treated with fenbendazole or ivermectin, or not treated, for gastrointestinal nematode infections.

The concentrations of nitrate were selected as 0, 3.5, 7.0, 10.5, 14.0, and 17.6 mM/L in BG medium. The lower concentrations of nitrogen were found to be significantly decreasing the cell count and photosynthetic activity in the microalga as well as changing cell morphology. The amount of biomass, its productivity and lipid yield were significantly affected. The highest biomass of 689.15 ± 14.27 mg/L was achieved in the concentration of 17.6 mM/L with the biomass productivity of 38.28 ± 0.78 mg/L. The highest lipid accumulation of 41.46 ± 1.94% dry-cell  was obtained at a concentration of 3.5 mM/L, whereas the lowest lipid accumulation of 29.22 ± 1.65% at the concentration of 17.6 mM/L sodium nitrate.

However, the mechanism through which RSV improves insulin resistance is not fully understood yet. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism through which RSV ameliorates insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model, as well as palmitic acid (PA) treated L6 cells, with a specific focus on the response of RSV on fatty acid oxidation.Male C57BL6/J mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal diet-fed mice (ND), the high-fat diet-fed mice (HFD), HFD supplemented with RSV (100 mg/kg  [BW]/day orally; n = 10). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid levels were determined. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was used to measure blood glucose and area under the curve. The quantitative insulin sensitivity index was calculated to assess insulin resistance. Skeletal muscles were collected for histology study and protein expression measurement. L6 cells were cultured with PA and the glucose concentration in the culture medium, and the intracellular TG levels were tested. RSV, chloroquine, palmitoyltransferase and Ku-55933 were administered to differentiate L6 cells.The HFD fed mice showed increased BW, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. The expressions of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, cytochrome oxidase subunit IV protein were significantly decreased in the skeletal muscles of HFD fed mice and PA-treated L6 cells. All these effects induced by HFD and PA were reversed by RSV treatment.ATM is a key factor to improve HFD-induced lipid metabolism and insulin resistance in skeletal muscles. The effects of RSV on ameliorating HFD-induced abnormal lipid metabolism and insulin resistance mediated through ATM-AMPK pathway may due to its improvement in fatty acid oxidation efficiency and sequential reduction in ROS production in skeletal muscle. These results provide important theoretical evidence for the application of RSV in the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus and related metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692759>Acute effect of a cod protein hydrolysate on postprandial acylated ghrelin concentration and sensations associated with appetite in healthy subjects: a double-blind crossover trial.</a></h1><p>Fish protein hydrolysates are suggested to contain bioactive sequences capable of affecting metabolic pathways involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and  when consumed in low doses. Modulation of the appetite-regulating hormone ghrelin may explain suppression of insulin secretion and  loss observed in previous studies with fish protein hydrolysates.This study aimed to assess the effect of a single, low dose of cod protein hydrolysate (CPH) before a breakfast meal on postprandial acylated ghrelin concentration and sensations associated with appetite in healthy subjects.In this explorative trial with a crossover design, 41 healthy individuals (15 males and 26 females, age 51 ± 6 years) completed 2 study days separated by 4-7 days of washout.

Acylated ghrelin concentrations were measured before test drink/breakfast (baseline) and at time 0, 20, 40, 80, and 180 min postprandially. Sensations associated with appetite were measured by a Visual Analog Scale (100 mm) at baseline and 0, 20, 40, and 180 min postprandially.Statistically, no difference was observed between CPH and control for postprandial acylated ghrelin concentrations (mean difference geometric mean: 1.05 pg/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97-1.13,  = 0.266), or between the total area under the curve (tAUC) for acylated ghrelin after CPH (tAUC = 17518 pg/mL × min, 95% CI: 0-47941) and control (tAUC = 17272 pg/mL × min, 95% CI: 0-48048,  = 0.991). No differences were found between CPH and control for sensation of appetite, according to tAUC of postprandial scores for satiety ( = 0.794) and the feeling of fullness ( = 0.996).We did not find an effect of a single dose of CPH on postprandial concentrations of acylated ghrelin or sensations related to feeling of hunger, compared to control.

Osmolality, pH, viscosity, and sodium concentration were determined using an osmometer, pH meter, rheometer, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, respectively.The MW of HA varied considerably between formulations. The PDI was >2.0 in two formulations (2.28 and 4.94), suggesting the presence of a copolymer and/or HA size variability. Three formulations exhibited viscosity exceeding the blur threshold at different shear rates. Viscosity at low shear rates was generally highest in formulations containing high-MW HA. Correlations were found between observed viscosity and a predictive/calculated value, except for four copolymer-containing formulations, and osmolality (range, 154-335 mOsm/kg) and sodium concentration (range, 22-183 mM), with two exceptions. Compared with organic osmolytes, adding sodium decreased viscosity, particularly at lower shear rates.In the context of the literature, our findings suggest that for most patients with dry eye disease, the ideal HA-based artificial tear should include high-MW HA with a low PDI and exhibit enhanced viscosity at low shear rate (without exceeding the blur threshold). The inclusion of synergistic copolymers and a low sodium concentration may increase viscosity, but whether any of these physicochemical properties or correlations can predict clinical efficacy will require further investigation.Understanding the properties of HA-based artificial tears will support the development of unique formulations that target specific ocular surface conditions.Copyright 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694658>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids status and cognitive function in young women.</a></h1><p>Research indicates that low omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) may be associated with decreased cognitive function.

Participants completed a computer-based cognition testing battery (IntegNeuro™) evaluating the domains of impulsivity, attention, information processing, memory and executive function. The Omega-3 Index (O3I) was used to determine n-3 PUFA status (percentage of EPA (20:5n-3) plus DHA (22:6n3) in the red cell membrane) and the participants were divided into O3I tertile groups: T1 < 5.47%, T2 = 5.47-6.75%, T3 > 6.75%. Potential confounding factors of BMI, inflammatory status (C-reactive Protein), physical activity (total MET-min/wk), alpha1-acid glycoprotein, serum ferritin and hemoglobin, were assessed. Data reported as z-scores (mean ± SD), analyses via ANOVA and ANCOVA.Two hundred ninety-nine women (26.9 ± 5.4 y) completed the study (O3I data, n = 288). The ANOVA showed no overall group differences but a significant group × cognition domain interaction (p < 0.01). Post hoc tests showed that participants in the low O3I tertile group scored significantly lower on attention than the middle group (p = 0.01; ES = 0.45 [0.15-0.74]), while the difference with the high group was borderline significant (p = 0.052; ES = 0.38 [0.09-0.68]). After confounder adjustments, the low group had lower attention scores than both the middle (p = 0.01) and high (p = 0.048) groups. These findings were supported by univariate analyses which found significant group differences for the attention domain only (p = 0.004).Cognitive function in the attention domain was lower in women with lower O3I, but still within normal range. This reduced but normal level of cognition potentially provides a lower baseline from which cognition would decline with age.

Insight into factors associated with the pathogenesis of BPD is key to improving its prevention and treatment.To perform a systematic review, meta-analysis, and metaregression of clinical studies exploring the association between chorioamnionitis (CA) and BPD in preterm infants.PubMed and Embase were searched without language restriction (last search, October 1, 2018). Key search terms included bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chorioamnionitis, and risk factors.Included studies were peer-reviewed studies examining preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) or very low-birth- (<1500 g) infants and reporting primary data that could be used to measure the association between exposure to CA and the development of BPD.The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guideline was followed. Data were independently extracted by 2 researchers. A random-effects model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Heterogeneity in effect size across studies was studied using multivariate, random-effects metaregression analysis.The primary outcome was BPD, defined as supplemental oxygen requirement on postnatal day 28 (BPD28) or at the postmenstrual age of 36 weeks (BPD36). Covariates considered as potential confounders included differences between CA-exposed and CA-unexposed infants in gestational age, rates of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), exposure to antenatal corticosteroids, and rates of early- and late-onset sepsis.A total of 3170 potentially relevant studies were found, of which 158 met the inclusion criteria (244 096 preterm infants, 20 971 CA cases, and 24 335 BPD cases). Meta-analysis showed that CA exposure was significantly associated with BPD28 (65 studies; OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.88-2.86; P < .001; heterogeneity: I2 = 84%; P < .001) and BPD36 (108 studies; OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.42; P < .001; heterogeneity: I2 = 63%; P < .001). The association between CA and BPD remained significant for both clinical and histologic CA. In addition, significant differences were found between CA-exposed and CA-unexposed infants in gestational age, birth , odds of being small for gestational age, exposure to antenatal corticosteroids, and early- and late-onset sepsis. Chorioamnionitis was not significantly associated with RDS (48 studies; OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.92-1.34; P = .24; heterogeneity: I2 = 90%; P < .001), but multivariate metaregression analysis with backward elimination revealed that a model combining the difference in gestational age and the odds of RDS was associated with 64% of the variance in the association between CA and BPD36 across studies.The results of this study confirm that among preterm infants, exposure to CA is associated with a higher risk of developing BPD, but this association may be modulated by gestational age and risk of RDS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691913>Hematologic, lipid profile, immunity, and antioxidant status of growing rabbits fed black seed as natural antioxidants.</a></h1><p>It is known that using antibiotics by way of growth promoters has harmful side effects on both animals and consumer health due to cross-resistance among pathogens and residues in meat. Using antibiotic to promote growth has been banned in the most countries for this reason; so, we must search for feed additives alternative in animal production. One of them is the black seed (Nigella sativa). Fifty-four growing V-line unsexed rabbits, 4 weeks of age, with an average  of 776.7 g were randomly allocated to one of three treatments (n = 18): rabbits fed the basal diet (control), rabbits supplemented with either 300 or 600 mg of Nigella sativa seed (NSS)/kg diet. At 12 weeks of age, NSS supplementation significantly improved final ,  gain, feed conversion ratio (FCR), and performance index with significantly reduced feed consumption. Addition of 300 and 600 mg NSS/kg diet resulted in a significant increase in the number of RBCs and WBCs as compared to basal diet group. Compared to controls, NSS supplementation significantly stimulated the IgG and IgM immune responses of rabbits, significantly reduced serum total lipids, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein, and significantly increased the high-density lipoprotein concentration. All NSS treatments significantly increased the observed blood total antioxidant capacity and significantly decreased the malondialdehyde values, compared to the basal diet group. In conclusion, the results displayed that addition of NSS in rabbit diets improved productive performance, blood lipid profile, immunity, and antioxidant status, and supplementation with 600 mg/kg NSS was more effective than 300 mg/kg NSS seed supplementation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696098>Intraventricular Hemorrhage: Risk Factors and Association With Patent Ductus Arteriosus Treatment in Extremely Preterm Neonates.</a></h1><p> To assess maternal and neonatal risk factors for intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). To examine the association of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and its treatment, with IVH and its severity.  In this retrospective cohort study, we included preterm neonates born at <29 weeks, admitted to a tertiary level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in Calgary, Canada, between 2013 and 2016, who had a head ultrasound in the first 7 days of life. A subset analysis included neonates who also had cardiac ultrasound in the first 3 days of life.  Of the 495 neonates, 121 (24.4%) had IVH of any grade and 48 (9.7%) had severe IVH. Identified risk factors were small birth gestation and , lack of antenatal corticosteroids, maternal chorioamnionitis, Apgar score <5 at 5 min, umbilical cord pH < 7, respiratory distress syndrome, early onset sepsis, hypercapnia, pCO fluctuations, prolonged intubation, inhaled nitric oxide, inotropes or normal saline boluses, metabolic derangements, opioids infusions, and bicarbonate/THAM therapy. In a primary analysis of the total cohort, when the decision to treat a PDA was used as a surrogate marker of its clinical significance, a PDA requiring treatment was associated with a higher risk of IVH. There was no significant difference in the incidence of IVH between neonates with early treatment of a clinically significant PDA compared to late, however early indomethacin treatment was associated with reduced severity of IVH. In the subset analysis, the presence of a hemodynamically significant PDA (hs-PDA) was not associated with a higher probability of IVH. Of those with severe IVH, 18 (55%) had a hs-PDA; this is clinically but not statistically significant.  Identified risk factors should be the target of IVH reduction bundles. Early indomethacin treatment for a clinically significant PDA may reduce IVH severity.Copyright © 2019 Khanafer-Larocque, Soraisham, Stritzke, Al Awad, Thomas, Murthy, Kamaluddeen, Scott and Mohammad.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695426>S100 Calcium Binding Protein A11 (S100A11) Promotes The Proliferation, Migration And Invasion Of Cervical Cancer Cells, And Activates Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling.</a></h1><p>This study is aimed to investigate the specific regulatory role of S100 calcium binding protein A11 (S100A11) on cervical cancer (CC), and reveal the potential mechanisms relating to Wnt/β-catenin signaling.The expression of S100A11 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), adjacent non-cancerous, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and normal cervical tissues was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and/or immunohistochemistry. After transfection of pENTER-S100A11 or sh-S100A11-1/sh-S100A11-2, the viability, cell cycle, migration and invasion of C33A or SiHa cells were detected.

The expression of E-caherin (), N-caherin (), β-catenin (), and c-Myc () in C33A and SiHa cells was detected by Western blot.The expression of S100A11 was significantly higher in CSCC tissues than in adjacent non-cancerous, CIN, and normal cervical tissues (P < 0.05). S100A11 expression was positively correlated with the FIGO stage and lymph node metastasis of CSCC patients (P < 0.05). The transfection of pENTER-S100A11 into C33A cells significantly increased the cell viability, the percentage of cells in G2/M phase, the numbers of migratory and invasive cells, as well as the tumor volume and  in mice (P < 0.05). Overexpression of S100A11 also significantly downregulated E-caherin, and upregulated N-caherin, β-catenin, and c-Myc in C33A cells (P < 0.05).

Whether this predisposes these individuals to long-term adverse outcomes is still unresolved.To describe the association of  mass index (BMI, calculated as  in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) with long-term outcomes in patients with HCM in terms of overall disease progression, heart failure symptoms, and arrhythmias.In this cohort study, retrospective data were analyzed from the ongoing prospective Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry, an international database created by 8 high-volume HCM centers that includes more than 6000 patients who have been observed longitudinally for decades. Records from database inception up to the first quarter of 2018 were analyzed. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to BMI class (normal  group, <25; preobesity group, 25-30; and obesity group, >30). Patients with 1 or more follow-up visits were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from April to October 2018.Association of baseline BMI with outcome was assessed.Outcome was measured against overall and cardiovascular mortality, a heart failure outcome (ejection fraction less than 35%, New York Heart Association class III/IV symptoms, cardiac transplant, or assist device implantation), a ventricular arrhythmic outcome (sudden cardiac death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy), and an overall composite outcome (first occurrence of any component of the ventricular arrhythmic or heart failure composite end point, all-cause mortality, atrial fibrillation, or stroke).Of the 3282 included patients, 2019 (61.5%) were male, and the mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 47 (15) years. These patients were observed for a median (interquartile range) of 6.8 (3.3-13.3) years. There were 962 patients in the normal  group (29.3%), 1280 patients in the preobesity group (39.0%), and 1040 patients in the obesity group (31.7%). Patients with obesity were more symptomatic (New York Heart Association class of III/IV: normal , 87 [9.0%]; preobesity, 138 [10.8%]; obesity, 215 [20.7%]; P < .001) and more often had obstructive physiology (normal , 201 [20.9%]; preobesity, 327 [25.5%]; obesity, 337 [32.4%]; P < .001). At follow-up, obesity was independently associated with the HCM-related overall composite outcome (preobesity vs normal : hazard ratio [HR], 1.102; 95% CI, 0.920-1.322; P = .29; obesity vs normal : HR, 1.634; 95% CI, 1.332-1.919; P < .001) and the heart failure composite outcome (preobesity vs normal : HR, 1.192; 95% CI, 0.930-1.1530; P = .20; obesity vs normal : HR, 1.885; 95% CI, 1.485-2.393; P < .001) irrespective of age, sex, left atrium diameter, obstruction, and genetic status. Obesity increased the likelihood of atrial fibrillation but not of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.Obesity is highly prevalent among patients with HCM and is associated with increased likelihood of obstructive physiology and adverse outcomes. Strategies aimed at preventing obesity and  increase may play an important role in management and prevention of disease-related complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691468>Dietary alpha-ketoglutarate promotes beige adipogenesis and prevents obesity in middle-aged mice.</a></h1><p>Aging usually involves the progressive development of certain illnesses, including diabetes and obesity. Due to incapacity to form new white adipocytes, adipose expansion in aged mice primarily depends on adipocyte hypertrophy, which induces metabolic dysfunction. On the other hand, brown adipose tissue burns fatty acids, preventing ectopic lipid accumulation and metabolic diseases. However, the capacity of brown/beige adipogenesis declines inevitably during the aging process. Previously, we reported that DNA demethylation in the Prdm16 promoter is required for beige adipogenesis. DNA methylation is mediated by ten-eleven family proteins (TET) using alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) as a cofactor. Here, we demonstrated that the circulatory AKG concentration was reduced in middle-aged mice (10-month-old) compared with young mice (2-month-old). Through AKG administration replenishing the AKG pool, aged mice were associated with the lower  gain and fat mass, and improved glucose tolerance after challenged with high-fat diet (HFD). These metabolic changes are accompanied by increased expression of brown adipose genes and proteins in inguinal adipose tissue. Cold-induced brown/beige adipogenesis was impeded in HFD mice, whereas AKG rescued the impairment of beige adipocyte functionality in middle-aged mice. Besides, AKG administration up-regulated Prdm16 expression, which was correlated with an increase of DNA demethylation in the Prdm16 promoter. In summary, AKG supplementation promotes beige adipogenesis and alleviates HFD-induced obesity in middle-aged mice, which is associated with enhanced DNA demethylation of the Prdm16 gene.© 2019 The Authors.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) comprise populations of immature myeloid cells in tumor-bearing hosts with a highly immunosuppressive capacity. We could previously identify RIG-I-like helicases (RLH) as targets for the immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer inducing immunogenic tumor cell death and type I interferons (IFN) as key mediators linking innate with adaptive immunity.Mice with orthotopically implanted Kras p53 Ptf1a-Cre (KPC) pancreatic tumors were treated intravenously with the RLH ligand polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), and the immune cell environment in tumor and spleen was characterized. A comprehensive analysis of the suppressive capacity as well as the whole transcriptomic profile of isolated MDSC subsets was performed. Antigen presentation capability of MDSC from mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing tumors was investigated in T cell proliferation assays. The role of IFN in MDSC function was investigated in Ifnar1 mice.MDSC were strongly induced in orthotopic KPC-derived pancreatic cancer, and frequencies of MDSC subsets correlated with tumor  and G-CSF serum levels, whereas other immune cell populations decreased. Administration of the RLH-ligand induced a IFN-driven immune response, with increased activation of T cells and dendritic cells (DC), and a reduced suppressive capacity of both polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSC and monocytic (M)-MDSC fractions. Whole transcriptomic analysis confirmed an IFN-driven gene signature of MDSC, a switch from a M2/G2- towards a M1/G1-polarized phenotype, and the induction of genes involved in the antigen presentation machinery. Nevertheless, MDSC failed to present tumor antigen to T cells. Interestingly, we found MDSC with reduced suppressive function in Ifnar1-deficient hosts; however, there was a common flaw in immune cell activation, which was reflected by defective immune cell activation and tumor control.We provide evidence that the treatment with immunostimulatory RNA reprograms the TME of pancreatic cancer by reducing the suppressive activity of MDSC, polarizing myeloid cells into a M1-like state and recruiting DC. We postulate that tumor cell-targeting combination strategies may benefit from RLH-based TME remodeling. In addition, we provide novel insights into the dual role of IFN signaling in MDSC's suppressive function and provide evidence that host-intrinsic IFN signaling may be critical for MDSC to gain suppressive function during tumor development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695550>Specialty Showcase Days: Can Specialist Careers Workshops Improve The Consideration Of ENT For Medical Students?</a></h1><p>We hypothesize that poor consideration of specialist surgery is due to a lack of exposure to information about careers and practice itself. Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) surgery is given little  in medical school curricula, despite ENT problems being extremely common. Our objective is to assess whether a specialty showcase day was sufficient to boost informed consideration of this career.We designed a half-day course involving an interactive careers workshop exploring ENT as a specialty choice, alongside simulation stations of commonly presenting ENT problems led by ENT doctors. We used pre- and post-course evaluation sheets to explore factors that encourage and discourage students from surgical careers and perceptions of ENT.A large proportion of UK medical schools do not offer ENT placements, and of those that do, nearly half are not compulsory. This leaves students unaware of ENT as a career option and unclear about what an ENT career comprises. Our half-day course took place in the simulation suite at St Mary's Hospital, London.Medical students were mainly in their third year of study and had aspirations towards a variety of surgical and non-surgical careers, with a minority aspiring towards ENT before the course.Our results demonstrate that all students found the session useful and had a much better understanding of ENT practice, with almost all students leaving more likely to consider a career in ENT.We would like to repeat this session in different student year groups and compare their perceptions with our results. We find our results a good case for including informative careers workshops as part of medical school teaching. We pose that interactive workshops exploring specialist surgical careers are a valid way to enable students in making informed career decisions - particularly in specialties that are under-represented at medical school.© 2019 Arwyn-Jones et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695236>El receptor soluble de insulina y el síndrome metabólico.</a></h1><p>The metabolic syndrome describes a group of signs that increase the likelihood for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer. The action of insulin depends on its binding to membrane receptors on its target cells. We wonder if blood insulin could travel bound to proteins and if, in the presence of hyperinsulinemia, a soluble insulin receptor might be generated. We used young adult Wistar rats (which have no predisposition to obesity or diabetes), whose drinking water was added 20 % of sugar and that were fed a standard diet ad libitum for two and six months. They were compared with control rats under the same conditions, but that had running water for consumption. At two months, the rats developed central obesity, moderate hypertension, high triglyceride levels, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, i.e. metabolic syndrome. Electrophoresis of the rats' plasma proteins was performed, followed by Western Blot (WB) for insulin and for the outer portion of the insulin receptor. The bands corresponding to insulin and to the receptor external part were at the same molecular  level, 25-fold higher than that of free insulin. We demonstrated that insulin, both in control animals and in those with hyperinsulinemia, travels bound to the receptor outer portion (ectodomain), which we called soluble insulin receptor, and that is released al higher amounts in response to plasma insulin increase; in rats with metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia, plasma levels are much higher than in controls. Soluble insulin receptor increase in blood might be an early sign of metabolic syndrome.Copyright: © 2019 Permanyer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691508>BMI growth trajectory from ages 2 to 6 years and its association with maternal obesity, diabetes during pregnancy, gestational  gain, and breastfeeding.</a></h1><p>To identify latent BMI growth trajectories from ages 2 to 6 years and examine their independent associations with maternal prepregnancy obesity or overweight, pre-existing type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) or gestational diabetes (GDM) with or without requiring antidiabetic medications during pregnancy, excessive gestational  gain (EGWG), and breastfeeding ≤ 6 months.Data included 71 892 children born at Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals in 2007 to 2011 with complete information on maternal risk factors. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to identify latent BMI trajectory groups. Logistic regression was used to assess independent associations adjusted for covariates.Three distinct BMI trajectory groups were identified: Group 1 (59% of the cohort) had stable low BMI, Group 2 (35% of the cohort) had stable median BMI, and Group 3 (6% of the cohort) had high and increasing BMI over time. Relative to Groups 1 and 2 combined, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) of being in Group 3 associated with maternal exposures were 5.6 (5.1-6.2) for prepregnancy obesity, 2.4 (2.2-2.7) for prepregnancy overweight, 2.1 (1.2-3.7) for T1D, 1.6 (1.4-1.8) for T2D, 1.4 (1.3-1.6) for GDM requiring medication treatment, 1.1 (1.0-1.3) for GDM not requiring medication, 1.3 (1.2-1.4) for EGWG, and 1.2 (1.2-1.3) for breastfeeding ≤ 6 months.Child's high and increasing BMI trajectory was strongly associated with maternal prepregnancy obesity and overweight, modestly associated with maternal T1D, T2D, and GDM requiring medication treatment and EGWG, and slightly associated with breastfeeding ≤ 6 months.

Dietary intake of antioxidants, particularly curcumin, as an active ingredient of turmeric extract, may have noticeable effects on obesity and its important complications such as cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of curcumin supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors among overweight and obese female adolescents.Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial; Pediatric Cardiovascular Research Center, Isfahan, Iran.60 adolescent girls (aged 13-18 years) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or intervention. The adolescents were asked to consume one 500 mg tablet per day, containing either standardized 95% turmeric extract or placebo, and to undergo a  maintenance or a mild  loss diet for 10 weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical indices were assessed at the baseline and the end of the intervention.Curcumin supplementation had beneficial effects on  mass index (P = 0.019), waist circumference (P = 0.008), hip circumference (P = 0.030), high-density lipoprotein levels (P = 0.042) and triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein ratio (P = 0.021). However, in univariate analysis of covariance, no significant differences were found between the intervention and placebo groups after 10 weeks of supplementation (P > 0.05).Prescription of curcumin supplementation along with use of a slight  loss diet might have beneficial effects on some cardiovascular risk factors among overweight and obese female adolescents. Larger clinical trials with higher curcumin doses and longer duration are needed to confirm the results from the current study.IRCT20171107037302N1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694707>A data-driven approach to predicting diabetes and cardiovascular disease with machine learning.</a></h1><p>Diabetes and cardiovascular disease are two of the main causes of death in the United States. Identifying and predicting these diseases in patients is the first step towards stopping their progression. We evaluate the capabilities of machine learning models in detecting at-risk patients using survey data (and laboratory results), and identify key variables within the data contributing to these diseases among the patients.Our research explores data-driven approaches which utilize supervised machine learning models to identify patients with such diseases. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, we conduct an exhaustive search of all available feature variables within the data to develop models for cardiovascular, prediabetes, and diabetes detection. Using different time-frames and feature sets for the data (based on laboratory data), multiple machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosting) were evaluated on their classification performance. The models were then combined to develop a weighted ensemble model, capable of leveraging the performance of the disparate models to improve detection accuracy. Information gain of tree-based models was used to identify the key variables within the patient data that contributed to the detection of at-risk patients in each of the diseases classes by the data-learned models.The developed ensemble model for cardiovascular disease (based on 131 variables) achieved an Area Under - Receiver Operating Characteristics (AU-ROC) score of 83.1% using no laboratory results, and 83.9% accuracy with laboratory results. In diabetes classification (based on 123 variables), eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) model achieved an AU-ROC score of 86.2% (without laboratory data) and 95.7% (with laboratory data). For pre-diabetic patients, the ensemble model had the top AU-ROC score of 73.7% (without laboratory data), and for laboratory based data XGBoost performed the best at 84.4%. Top five predictors in diabetes patients were 1) waist size, 2) age, 3) self-reported , 4) leg length, and 5) sodium intake. For cardiovascular diseases the models identified 1) age, 2) systolic blood pressure, 3) self-reported , 4) occurrence of chest pain, and 5) diastolic blood pressure as key contributors.We conclude machine learned models based on survey questionnaire can provide an automated identification mechanism for patients at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. We also identify key contributors to the prediction, which can be further explored for their implications on electronic health records.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693732>Inhibition of human lung adenocarcinoma growth and metastasis by JC polyomavirus-like particles packaged with a SP-B promoter driven CD59-specific shRNA.</a></h1><p>Lung cancer ranks first in both incidence and mortality and is a major health concern worldwide. Upon recognition of specific antigens on tumor cells, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is activated, arresting cell growth or inducing apoptosis. However, by overexpressing CD59, a membrane complement regulatory protein, lung cancer cells develop resistance to CDC. We previously showed that virus-like particles (VLPs) of human JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) could be used as a gene therapy vector to carry a suicide gene expression plasmid with a lung specific promoter (SP-B) for lung adenocarcinomas. Herein, we designed a CD59-specific shRNA expression plasmid driven by SP-B (pSPB-shCD59) to effectively and specifically inhibit CD59 overexpression in lung cancer cells. Treatment of lung cancer cells invitro with JCPyV VLPs containing pSPB-shCD59 (pSPB-shCD59/VLPs) induces CDC and death of cancer cells. Mice that were subcutaneously injected with human lung cancer cells showed an 87% inhibition in tumor growth after tail vein injection of pSPB-shCD59/VLPs. Moreover, in a mouse model of lung cancer metastasis, a reduction in the lung  by 39%, compared to the control group, was observed in mice treated with pSPB-shCD59/VLPs after tail vein injection of human lung cancer cells. Furthermore, tissue sectioning showed that the number and size of tumors produced was significantly reduced in the lungs of mice in the treatment group than those of the untreated group, indicating inhibition of metastasis by pSPB-shCD59/VLPs. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of pSPB-shCD59/VLPs as a therapeutic agent for CD59 overexpressed lung cancer.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696464>LncRNATCF7 up-regulates DNMT1 mediated by HPV-18 E6 and regulates biological behavior of cervical cancer cells by inhibiting miR-155.</a></h1><p>This work aimed to study the mechanism of lncRNATCF7 upregulating DNMT1 mediated by HPV-18 E6 and regulating the biological behavior of cervical cancer cells by inhibiting miR-155.HPV-16 E6 enhanced DNMT1 expression in cervical cancer cells, which was detected by Western blotting.

In all, 16 Serrana de Teruel animals were involved in this 2 x 2 factorial design using the factors LW (LIGHT vs. HEAVY) and vaccine treatment (control, C vs. vaccinated, VA). All animals received the same diet (ad libitum concentrate plus straw) over a 164-day fattening period. Temperament was assessed using chute and flight speed tests. Testicular diameter and subcutaneous fat thickness were recorded. Testosterone, IGF-1, urea, NEFA, and creatinine profiles were analyzed. Bull  gain was reduced in VA compared to C animals, regardless of the initial LW. The vaccine did not affect the temperament tests, subcutaneous fat thickness or NEFA and creatinine concentrations and had minor effects on linear  . The vaccine inhibited testicular growth, reduced plasma testosterone to residual levels, and increased urea concentrations. LIGHT-C animals exhibited increased mean plasma IGF-1 concentrations compared to LIGHT-VA animals.

A random selection of 50 stored images was assessed for inter- and intra-observer reliability between methods. In the cases of vaginal delivery univariate linear, multivariate linear and quantile regression were performed to predict time-to-delivery. Univariate and multivariate binomial logistic regression were performed to predict CS for FTP in the first stage of labor.The intra correlation coefficients (ICC) for the manual para-sagittal method for a single observer was 0.97 (CI 0.95-0.98) and for two observers was 0.96 (CI 0.93-0.98) indicating good reliability. The ICC for the sagittal method for a single observer was 0.93 (0.88-0.96) and for two observers was 0.74 (0.58-0.84) indicating moderate reliabilty for a single observer and poor reliability between two observers. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated narrower limits of agreement for the manual para-saggittal approach than for the sagittal approach for both single and two observers. The automated para-sagittal method failed to capture an image in 19% of cases. The mean difference between sagittal and para-sagittal methods was 11 . In pregnancies resulting in vaginal delivery, 54% of the variation in time-to-delivery was explained in a model combining parity, epidural and syntocinon use during labour and the sonographic findings of fetal head position and AOP. In the prediction of CS for FTP in the first stage of labour a model which combined maternal factors with the sonographic measurements of AOP and estimated fetal  was superior to one utilising maternal factors alone (area under the curve 0.80 vs 0.76).First, the method of measuring AOP with greatest reliability is the manual para-sagittal technique and future research should focus on this technique, second, over half of the variation in time to vaginal delivery can be explained by a model that combines maternal factors, pregnancy characteristics and ultrasound findings, and third, the ability of AOP to provide clinically useful prediction CS for FTP in the first stage of labour is limited.

The influence coefficients of particle size smaller than 2.5 μm (PM), particle size smaller than 10 μm (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO), ozone (O), and sulfur dioxide (SO) to the BMI score are 0.034 (SE = 0.002;  < 0.001), 0.023 (SE = 0.001;  < 0.001), 0.52 (SE = 0.095;  < 0.001), 0.045 (SE = 0.004;  < 0.001), 0.021 (SE = 0.002;  < 0.001), 0.008 (SE = 0.003;  = 0.015), respectively. Generally, air pollution has an adverse effect on . CO is the most influential pollutant, and female, middle-aged, and low-education populations are more severely affected. The results confirm that the adverse health effects of air pollution should be considered when making the air pollution policies. Findings also provide justification for health interventions, especially for people with obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691684>Nutritional properties and osteogenic activity of enzymatic hydrolysates of proteins from the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis).</a></h1><p>Seafood provides a range of health benefits due to its nutritional and bioactive components. However, the bioactive peptides derived from Mytilus edulis proteins were seldom reported, especially their beneficial effects related to bone growth in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the water soluble protein from Mytilus edulis was isolated and the osteogenic activity of Mytilus edulis protein was determined in vivo. The protein from Mytilus edulis was subjected to simulated digestion in vitro, and the hydrolysate of different stages for osteogenic activity by osteoblast proliferation. It was found that the hydrolysate, derived from proteins hydrolyzed by pepsin for 2 h and trypsin for 3 h, showed high osteogenic activity, which induced an increase of 35.56 ± 2.92% in mouse-MC3T3-E1-preosteoblast-cell growth and the alkaline-phosphatase activity was 2.94 ± 0.10 mU, which was an increase of 19.78% compared with that of the control. Moreover, the molecular  distribution of the peptides and the composition of the free amino acids were determined in order to evaluate the nutritional properties. These findings showed that the water soluble protein from Mytilus edulis could be used in functional food as a bioactive ingredient, which would be beneficial for bone growth and health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696128>Hypoxia Suppresses High Fat Diet-Induced Steatosis And Development Of Hepatic Adenomas.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the most common form of silent liver disease in the United States and obesity is associated with increased risk of NAFLD. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which is common in obese individuals is associated with a greater incidence of NAFLD, which in turn, increases the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is unclear how obesity, OSA and NAFLD interrelate nor how they collectively contribute to an increased risk for developing HCC.Male BALB/c mice were exposed to diethylnitrosamine and phenobarbital followed by 48 weeks of either standard chow diet (chow), chow with hypoxia, high-fat diet, or a combination of hypoxia and high-fat diet. We noninvasively monitored tumor development using micro-CT imaging. We tracked the total  gained throughout the study. We evaluated liver histology, fat accumulation, carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) expression, as well as, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).A high-fat diet without hypoxia led to the development of obesity that induced hepatic steatosis and promoted tumorigenesis. Animals on a high-fat diet and that were also exposed to hypoxia had lower total  gain, lower steatosis, lower serum AST and ALT levels, and fewer number of hepatic adenomas than a high-fat diet without hypoxia.These findings suggest that hypoxia abrogates obesity, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic tumorigenesis related to a high-fat diet.© 2019 Sweeney et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693468>Low Ouabain Doses and AMP-Activated Protein Kinase as Factors Supporting Electrogenesis in Skeletal Muscle.</a></h1><p>Many motor disorders are associated with depolarization of the membrane of skeletal muscle fibers due to the impaired functioning of Na,K-ATPase. Here, we studied the role of ouabain (specific Na,K-ATPase ligand) and AMP-activated protein kinase (key regulator of muscle metabolism) in the maintenance of muscle electrogenesis; the levels of these endogenous factors are directly related to the motor activity. After 4-day intraperitoneal administration of ouabain (1 µg/kg daily), a hyperpolarization of sarcolemma was registered in isolated rat diaphragm muscles due to an increase in the electrogenic activity of Na,K-ATPase. In acute experiments, addition of nanomolar ouabain concentrations to the bathing solution resulted in the muscle membrane hyperpolarization within 15 min. The effect of ouabain reversed to membrane depolarization with the increase in the external potassium concentration. It is possible that Na,K-ATPase activation by ouabain may be regulated by such factors as specific subcellular location, interaction with molecular partners, and changes in the ionic balance. Preventive administration of the AMP-activated protein kinase activator AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside; 400 mg/kg  daily for 7 days) in chronic experiments resulted in the stabilization of the endplate structure and abolishment of depolarization of the rat soleus muscle membrane caused by the motor activity cessation. The obtained data can be useful for creating approaches for correction of muscle dysfunction, especially at the early stages, prior to the development of muscle atrophy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692992>Low-Voltage Oscillatory Neurons for Memristor-Based Neuromorphic Systems.</a></h1><p>Neuromorphic systems consisting of artificial neurons and synapses can process complex information with high efficiency to overcome the bottleneck of von Neumann architecture. Artificial neurons are essentially required to possess functions such as leaky integrate-and-fire and output spike. However, previous reported artificial neurons typically have high operation voltage and large leakage current, leading to significant power consumption, which is contrary to the energy-efficient biological model. Here, an oscillatory neuron based on Ag filamentary threshold switching memristor (TS) that has a low operation voltage (<0.6 V) with ultralow power consumption (<1.8 µW) is presented. It can trigger neuronal functions, including leaky integrate-and-fire and threshold-driven spiking output, with high endurance (>10 cycles). Being connected to an external resistor or a resistive switching memristor (RS) as synaptic , the TS clearly demonstrates self-oscillation behavior once the input pulse voltage exceeds the threshold voltage. Meanwhile, the oscillation frequency is proportional to the input pulse voltage and the conductance of RS synapse, which can be used to integrate the weighted sum current. As an energy-efficient memristor-based spiking neural network, this combination of TS oscillatory neuron with RS synapse is further evaluated for image recognition achieving an accuracy of 79.2 ± 2.4% for CIFAR-10 subset.© 2019 The Authors.

Adults with obesity (79.3% female; 54.0% white; 44.7% black; mean age = 47.6 ± 11.8 years and  mass index = 38.4 ± 4.9 kg/m ) were randomized to IBT-alone (n = 50), IBT-liraglutide (n = 50) or Multicomponent (n = 50). General HRQoL was measured with the Short Form-36 (SF-36), and -related QoL was assessed with the Impact of  on Quality of Life-Lite scale. At week 52, participants in the three groups lost 6.1 ± 1.3%, 11.5 ± 1.3% and 11.8 ± 1.3% of initial , respectively. Both liraglutide-treated groups were significantly more likely than IBT-alone to achieve clinically meaningful improvements in total -related QoL. They also both achieved greater improvements than IBT-alone in -related public distress and in general mental health, as measured by the SF-36 mental component summary score. Independent of treatment group, greater categorical  loss was associated with greater improvements in several domains of both general and -related QoL.

These breeds are well adapted to produce under harsh conditions but have a very small size and low productivity. The aim of this study was to establish the basis for future genetic evaluations to improve growth potential of this local stock. A total of 13,095   and pedigree of 945 kids in the caprine herd of the Arid Areas Institute of Médenine were used. Random regression (RR) and multiple trait (MT) models were analyzed and compared. All models included effects of age and  of dam, age, sex and type of birth of the kid, and year × month of recording, plus random direct and maternal additive genetic and permanent environmental effects. RR and MT models behave similarly, with RR showing slightly better goodness of fit. Heritability estimates for direct (ranging from 0.15 to 0.4) and maternal (0.05 to 0.3) effects showed that efficient selection for  is feasible in this population. Estimated correlations between ages were high (> 0.8) for direct effects across all ages and low (down to 0.2) for  taken at distant ages for maternal effects. Estimated genetic correlations between direct and maternal components revealed an antagonistic relationship, especially at early ages. Recording of at least one  in the first month of age of the kids to evaluate the maternal capacity and a later  to evaluate direct effects on  is recommended for genetic evaluations under field conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694716>Association of changes in commute mode with  mass index and visceral adiposity: a longitudinal study.</a></h1><p>Prospective data are sparse for active commuting to work and  in Asia. We assessed the association of 5-year changes in commuting mode with  mass index (BMI) and the indicators of abdominal obesity in Japanese working adults.In this longitudinal study, we studied 29,758 participants (25,808 men and 3950 women) in Japan aged 30 to 64 years at baseline who underwent further health examination 5 years after the baseline examination. Changes in BMI were calculated from objectively measured  height and  at baseline and follow-up examination. Visceral and subcutaneous fat areas and waist circumference measured by computed tomography scans were used as indicators for abdominal adiposity. Linear regression was applied to estimate the association of changes in commuting mode with the obesity outcomes.Within the 5-year study period, adults who maintained inactive commuting gained , and compared with this group, adults who switched to inactive commuting had higher  gain; conversely, adults who switched to active or public transportation commuting and especially those who maintained active or public transportation commuting experienced less  gain. Subgroup analysis showed similar tendency across the different transitions of leisure-time exercise or occupational physical activity. For example, among adults who maintained no exercise (n = 16,087), the adjusted mean (95% confidence intervals) of the BMI change over 5 years in kg/m were 0.27 (0.24 to 0.30) for maintained inactive commuting group (reference), 0.34 (0.30 to 0.38) for switching to inactive commuting group (P = 0.046), 0.20 (0.18 to 0.22) for switching to active commuting or public transportation group (P = 0.001), and 0.09 (0.06 to 0.13) for maintained active commuting or public transportation group (P < 0.001). Maintained inactive commuting tended to be associated with larger gain in abdominal adiposity indicators.Switching from inactive commuting mode to more physically active commuting mode and maintaining active commuting can promote  control among working adults across different levels of occupational or leisure-time physical activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691478>Synthesis of 'butterfly cage' based on double-decker silsesquioxane.</a></h1><p>Novel polyhedral structures were prepared with a butterfly-shape comprised of oligosiloxane wings and a double- decker silsesquioxane (DDSQ) .

The primary aim is to determine an up-to-date demographic of SUFE, as well as current trends in presentation and radiological characteristics. Secondary aims are to quantify prophylactic fixation and subsequent contralateral SUFE.Between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2015, all cases of SUFE were identified in Northern Ireland. Patient demographics, slip characteristics and outcomes are presented and the incidence rates were calculated using census data. Temporal changes in incidence, compared with a previous cohort, are demonstrated.A total of 56 patients (80 hips) were identified. Based on census data, SUFE incidence has declined from 7.14 to 4.69/100,000 population aged < 16 years. Male cases predominated by > 2:1 ratio, and tended to be older than female cases. Approximately 75% of patients were above the 75th centile for age-sex adjusted . Knee pain as a presenting symptom led to a delay in diagnosis. Prophylactic fixation was performed in 25.9%, with contralateral slips occurring in 27.5%. AVN occurred in 7.4% and remained static.The incidence of SUFE has declined ~34% in our region. When SUFE occurs, knee pain often results in a delay in definitive diagnosis, and commands clinical vigilance to avoid delays in diagnosis. Patients in our region should be aware of a 1-in-4 contralateral slip rate.

Here we would like to investigate and discuss the potential risk factors of cortical visual impairment after cerebral angiography.Based on the presence of post-operative cortical visual impairment, 4,528 patients who received cerebral angiography were split into two groups. The relevant risk factors were compared and analyzed between the groups.In the patient cohort, 11 cases exhibited post-operative cortical visual impairment (0.24%). In particular, seven patients presented with blurred vision and four presented with binocular blindness. Visual sensation of these patients recovered after the treatment. Our univariate analysis revealed that differences in age, , sex ratios, proportions of patients with hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipemia, and operation time were not statistically significant between the two groups (>0.05). The multivariate analysis indicated that the dosage of contrast medium was the independent risk factor for post-operative cortical visual impairment.Clinically, cortical visual impairment following cerebral angiography typically presented as blurred vision or complete blindness. We have identified the dosage of contrast medium as the most critical independent risk factor based on our study. Preventive strategies need to be implemented to avoid post-operative cortical visual impairment in this regard.© 2019 Yang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695344>The effects of exercise and diet program in overweight people - Nordic walking versus walking.</a></h1><p>Nordic walking (NW) has been recommended as a form of exercise for clinical populations. Despite intervention programs designed to face a clinical status may last several months, no longitudinal studies have compared the effect of NW to another usual form of exercise, like walking (W). We evaluated the effects of diet combined with a long-supervised NW versus W training on  composition, aerobic capacity and strength in overweight adults.Thirty-eight participants, randomized into a NW (n=19, 66±7 years,  mass index (BMI) 33±5)) and a W (n=19, 66±8 years, BMI 32±5) group, followed a diet and a supervised training routine 3 times/week for 6 months. The variables assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months were: anthropometric indexes (ie, BMI and waist circumference (WC)),  composition, aerobic capacity (oxygen consumption (VO), peak power output (PPO), 6-min walking test (6MWT)) and strength (maximal voluntary contraction of biceps brachialis (MVC) and quadriceps femoris (MVC), chair stand and arm curl (AC)).After 6 months both NW and W group decreased significantly BMI (6% and 4%, respectively) and WC (8% and 4%, respectively), but only the NW group reduced (<0.05) total  fat (8%), android fat (14%) and leg fat (9%). After 6 months, PPO increased (<0.05) in both groups, but VO improved (<0.05) only in the NW group (8%). After 6 months, 6MWT increased (<0.001) in both groups and only the NW group improved (<0.05) in MVC (14%), MVC (17%) and AC (35%).Our results suggest that NW can give in some relevant health parameters, greater and faster benefits than W. Thus, NW can be a primary tool to counteract the obesity and overweight state in middle-aged adults.© 2019 Muollo et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696659>Bone ingrowth comparison of irregular titanium and cobalt-chromium coatings in a translational cancellous bone model.</a></h1><p>The use of cobalt-chromium (CoCr)-bearing surfaces in total joint replacement (TJR) remains the predominate bearing surface. The conundrum with using this biomaterial has been selecting an ideal porous coating to assure reproducible skeletal attachment. There has been evidence that smooth CoCr beads may be inferior for skeletal attachment compared to identically shaped titanium (Ti) beads. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that an increased surface area and roughness favors osteoblast adhesion to metallic biomaterials. Therefore, we hypothesized that an irregular shape CoCr bead with an increased surface texture would help correct the negative bone responses that have been reported with smooth beaded CoCr coatings and thus allowing for bone ingrowth equivalently as an irregular commercially pure Ti porous coating with similar porosity. This investigation employed a -bearing translational sheep cancellous bone model to accurately simulate a cancellous bone response as it would be clinically in a human TJR. The data analyses obtained from this investigation revealed similar bone responses between the porous coatings. By 12 weeks the irregular shape CoCr coating was able to achieve similar bone ingrowth with skeletal interlock when compared to a clinically proven Ti porous coating.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692577>Hyaluronic Acid as an Alternative to Autologous Human Serum Eye Drops: Initial Clinical Results with High-Molecular- Hyaluronic Acid Eye Drops.</a></h1><p>Autologous serum eye drops (ASED) are used in the treatment of most severe stages of dry eye. Once introduced, it is currently considered impossible to return to other lubricating eye drops or other commercially available therapeutic regimen.In a randomized study, non-preserved high-molecular- hyaluronic acid eye drops were offered as an alternative to 11 patients using autologous serum treatment for at least 3 months. The control group ( = 5) continued their treatment with ASED. The verum group ( = 6) used very-high-molecular- hyaluronic eye drops (Comfort Shield®) instead of the ASED.From four of initially six patients in the verum group that finished the study, 2 (50%) preferred to stay with the very-high-molecular- hyaluronic acid eye drops beyond the trial period, the other two returned to the earlier therapy with ASED. The control group continued their treatment as before and finished the study after 8 weeks.For the first time, artificial eye drops, i.e., high-molecular- hyaluronic acid eye drops, offered an acceptable alternative to ASED. Some patients perceived these drops as even better than the patient's own serum. This is the first evidence that optimization of the molecular structure of hyaluronic acid can be used to create eye drops that are perceived to be better than other tested tear substitutes and even patients' own serum.

We investigated catches and local ecological knowledge (LEK) of diet, habitat, and past fishing experiences.Landings, prices, interviews, and restaurants demand for two species, Epinephelus marginatus (dusky grouper) and Epinephelus morio (red grouper), were registered.We visited 74 markets and 79 sites on the coast of Brazil in 2017-2018, and we interviewed 71 fishers: Bahia (NE), Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo (SE), and Santa Catarina (S). The landings sampled of dusky grouper (2016-2017) in Rio de Janeiro were: n = 222, size 38-109 cm,  1-24 kg, average 3.84 kg; in São Paulo, São Sebastião were: n = 47, size 39-106 cm,  2-8 kg, average of 2.77 kg; and at Santos: n = 80, 26-120 cm,  0.36-15 kg, average 2.72 kg. Red grouper was observed in markets in the northeastern Brazil. We did not observe Epinephelus marginatus from Bahia northward; a maximum size of 200 cm was reported south of the Bahia, besides Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo coasts, 20 years ago (or longer) by 12 fishers. Local knowledge of fishers was important for grouper data of habitat and diet; the reproduction period was identified by fishers as September to March.Groupers can be considered as a cultural and ecological keystone species. We suggest protective : 1) fishing zoning, 2) islands (MPAs) with the surveillance of fishers, 3) late Spring and early Summer as key periods for management (grouper reproduction), 4) studies on grouper larvae, 5) mapping of fishing spots, 6) studies on local knowledge. Collaboration with small-scale fishers and local knowledge could contribute to low-conflict management . In that regard, integrative models of management from Latin America, by using local knowledge and citizen science, could produce successful grouper management for Brazilian data-poor fisheries, a contrasting reality to the Mediterranean areas. Finally, the distribution of E. marginatus in Brazil leave us with questions: a) Have dusky groupers disappeared from Bahia because of a decline in the population? b) Was it uncommon in Northeast Brazil? c) Did changes in water temperatures forced a movement southward?</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696260>Vitamin E-blended versus conventional polyethylene liners in prostheses : Prospective, randomized trial with 3-year follow-up.</a></h1><p>Despite continuous technical improvements, polyethylene wear debris induced periprosthetic osteolysis remains the main cause for failure of hip arthroplasty. Progressive oxidation of polyethylene was identified as another risk factor for material failure. To overcome this problem, antioxidants such as vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) were supplemented by diffusion into the latest generation of polyethylene liners.The purpose of the present study was to investigate the clinical outcome of patients treated with vitamin E blended highly cross-linked ultra-high molecular  polyethylene liners (UHMWPE-XE) in comparison with conventional UHMWPE‑X liners by evaluating patient-reported outcome  (PROM's) at 3‑year follow-up.A total of 143 patients were recruited into this prospective, randomized trial in our academic center. Three years after implantation, 101 patients were examined in the outpatient clinic for follow-up. Of these, 51 (50.5%) received UHMWPE-XE and 50 (49.5%) UHMWPE‑X liners. Clinical outcome was evaluated using Harris-Hip-Score (HHS) UCLA-Score and Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS).There was a significant improvement in all PROM's at one- and three-year follow-up compared to the status before implantation. PROM's did not differ significantly between the first and third year follow-up. Both liner groups showed an equal clinical outcome.The present study demonstrates that the supplementation of vitamin E to polyethylene liners is reliable and safe without showing higher complication rates compared with conventional polyethylene liners. The shortterm clinical outcome of vitamin E-blended (UHMWPE‑XE) is equivalent to those of conventional highly cross-linked polyethylene liners.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695782>Thymopentin ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis by triggering the production of IL-22 in both innate and adaptive lymphocytes.</a></h1><p> Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, notoriously challenging to treat. Previous studies have found a positive correlation between thymic atrophy and colitis severity. It was, therefore, worthwhile to investigate the effect of thymopentin (TP5), a synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to the active domain of the thymopoietin, on colitis.  Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice were treated with TP5 by subcutaneous injection. , colon length, colon , immune organ index, disease activity index (DAI) score, and the peripheral blood profile were examined. The immune cells of the spleen and colon were analyzed by flow cytometry. Histology was performed on isolated colon tissues for cytokine analysis. Bacterial DNA was extracted from mouse colonic feces to assess the intestinal microbiota. Intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs), HCT116, CT26, and splenocytes were cultured and treated with TP5.  TP5 treatment increased the  and colon length, decreased the DAI score, and restored colon architecture of colitic mice. TP5 also decreased the infiltration of immune cells and expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Importantly, the damaged thymus and compromised lymphocytes in peripheral blood were significantly restored by TP5. Also, the production of IL-22, both in innate and adaptive lymphoid cells, was triggered by TP5. Given the critical role of IL-22 in mucosal host defense, we tested the effect of TP5 on mucus barrier and gut microbiota and found that the number of goblet cells and the level of Mucin-2 expression were restored, and the composition of the gut microbiome was normalized after TP5 treatment. The critical role of IL-22 in the protective effect of TP5 on colitis was further confirmed by administering the anti-IL-22 antibody (αIL-22), which completely abolished the effect of TP5. Furthermore, TP5 significantly increased the expression level of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (RORγt), a transcription factor for IL-22. Consistent with this, RORγt inhibitor abrogated the upregulation of IL-22 induced by TP5.  TP5 exerts a protective effect on DSS-induced colitis by triggering the production of IL-22 in both innate and adaptive lymphocytes. This study delineates TP5 as an immunomodulator that may be a potential drug for the treatment of UC.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694661>Determinants of nutritional status among children under age 5 in Ethiopia: further analysis of the 2016 Ethiopia demographic and health survey.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to examine the determinants of nutritional status among children under age 5 (0-59 months) in Ethiopia. Child malnutrition is an underlying cause of almost half (45%) of child deaths, particularly in low socioeconomic communities of developing countries. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of stunting decreased from 47% in 2005 to 39% in 2016, but the prevalence of wasting changed little over the same time period (from 11 to 10%). Despite improvements in reducing the prevalence of malnutrition, the current rate of progress is not fast enough to reach the World Health Organization global target for reducing malnutrition 40% by 2025.This study used data from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Heath Survey (EDHS). The analysis used stunting and wasting as dependent variables, while the independent variables were characteristics of children, mothers, and households. Logistic regression was used to analyze the determinants of nutritional status among children. Bivariate analysis was also used to analyze the association between the dependent and independent variables.Study results show that child's age, sex, and perceived birth , mother's educational status,  mass index (BMI), and maternal stature, region, wealth quintile, type of toilet facility, and type of cooking fuel had significant associations with stunting. Child's age, sex, and perceived birth , mother's BMI, and residence and region showed significant associations with wasting. The study found that child, maternal, and household characteristics were significantly associated with stunting and wasting among children under age 5.These findings imply that a multi-sectorial and multidimensional approach is important to address malnutrition in Ethiopia. The education sector should promote reduction of cultural and gender barriers that contribute to childhood malnutrition. The health sector should encourage positive behaviors toward childcare and infant feeding practices. More should be done to help households adopt improved types of toilet facilities and modern types of cooking fuels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695423>Nitrogen Permease Regulator-Like-2 Exhibited Anti-Tumor Effects And Enhanced The Sensitivity Of Colorectal Cancer Cells To Oxaliplatin And 5-Fluorouracil.</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Our previous study revealed that nitrogen permease regulator-like-2 (NPRL2), a promising anti-tumor gene, was downregulated at both the blood and tissue levels in CRC patients compared with that in healthy individuals.This study aims to explore the role of NPRL2 in CRC.Herein, we constructed NPRL2 overexpression lentivirus vectors and transfected them into HT29 cells. The transfected cells were inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice. Tumor growth, pathology, apoptosis, and the protein expression of caspase-3, caspase-7, Bax, Bcl-2, and phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt) were evaluated. To further explore whether NPRL2 could reduce drug resistance of CRC cells against oxaliplatin (L-OHP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), we constructed a tumor model using HT29 cells. The tumor model was treated with lentiviral particles assembled with vectors encoding NPRL2 and exposed to L-OHP and 5-FU. Tumor growth, pathology, apoptosis, and the protein expression of caspase-3, caspase-7, Bax, Bcl-2, p-Akt, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) were evaluated.The results indicated that in the in vivo CRC xenograft model, NPRL2 reduced the tumor volume and  and enhanced apoptosis. Our results also confirmed that NPRL2 enhanced the sensitivity of CRC cells to L-OHP and 5-FU. Our studies further demonstrated that NPRL2 exerted anti-tumor and anti-drug resistance effects through the caspase-3, caspase-7, Bax, Bcl-2, Akt, P-gp, and MRP1 pathways.Our present work demonstrated that NPRL2 exhibited anti-tumor effects and enhanced the sensitivities of CRC cells to L-OHP and 5-FU through the P-gp and MRP1 pathways.© 2019 Liu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692364>Altered immune system in offspring of rat maternal vertical sleeve gastrectomy.</a></h1><p>Obesity in women results in reduced fertility and increased complications during pregnancy. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) effectively reduces , type-2 diabetes and dyslipidemia, but is also associated with preterm and small-for-gestational age births. The mechanism by which VSG impacts fetal development remains unknown. Here we hypothesize that previously reported immune changes during rat VSG pregnancy are reflected long-term in the immune system of the offspring. Offspring of VSG and Sham dams were evaluated at postnatal day (PND) 21 and PND60. At PND21, VSG pups have lower numbers of circulating B lymphocytes compared to Sham pups (P<0.05) and have lower transcription of lymphocyte marker  (P<0.01) in the spleen, while other lymphocyte populations measured are not different. Total plasma IgG is higher (P<0.01) and C reactive protein is lower (P<0.05) in VSG offspring compared to Sham offspring at PND21. The central nervous system of VSG pups is also affected at PND21, having higher expression of  mRNA (P<0.05) and higher immunoreactivity of microglia marker, IBA1, in the hypothalamus. At PND60, the immune-hematologic differences are not present, however, mRNA expression of  is elevated (P<0.001) in the spleen of VSG offspring along with markers of T cells. These data suggest that the immune system of VSG offspring is compromised early in life, but rebounds after weaning and may even become hyperactive. Future work is needed to determine if the immune system of VSG offspring is capable of mounting a proper defense and if other aspects of development are affected.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695379>Administration of troxerutin and cerebroprotein hydrolysate injection alleviates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by down-regulating caspase molecules.</a></h1><p>Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R injury) is an important pathological process for nervous system. The I/R injury usually causes cerebral hypoxia, infarct or stroke. This study aimed to evaluate effects of troxerutin and cerebroprotein hydrolysate injection (TC) on I/R injury in rat models.Middle-cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat models were established. Rats were divided into normal control (NC), MCAO/R rat model (injecting saline) and MCAO/R rats administrating with TC group (injecting with TC at concentration of 2 mL/100 g ). Neurological scores were evaluated with Garcia scale. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was employed to observe infarct area, contralateral area and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Cerebral infarct size was examined and visualized by staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). Western blotting assay was used to determine caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression.The infarct size of mice in MCAO/R+TC group was smaller significantly compared to that in MCAO/R group (<0.05). The infarct/contralateral area ratio of T2 and T2 Flair signals in MCAO/R+TC group were lower significantly compared to that in MCAO/R group (<0.05). ADC values in MCAO/R+TC group were significantly enhanced compared to that in MCAO/R group (<0.05). The troxerutin and cerebroprotein treatment significantly increased neurological scores compared to that in MCAO/R group (<0.05). Troxerutin and cerebroprotein treatment significantly decreased expression of caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-8 compared to that in MCAO/R group (<0.05).Troxerutin and cerebroprotein administration alleviated cerebral I/R injury by down-regulating caspase molecules.© 2019 Sui et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695621>Two Weeks of High-Intensity Interval Training in Combination With a Non-thermal Diffuse Ultrasound Device Improves Lipid Profile and Reduces  Fat Percentage in Overweight Women.</a></h1><p>This study evaluated the effectiveness of an innovative strategy which combined low-frequency ultra sound (LOFU) with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to improve physical fitness and promote  fat loss in overweight sedentary women. A placebo controlled, parallel group randomized experimental design was used to investigate the efficacy of a 2-week combined LOFU and HIIT program (3 sessions per week). Participants were allocated into either the Experimental HIIT group (HIIT,  = 10) or Placebo HIIT group (HIIT,  = 10). Baseline exercise testing (maximal oxygen uptake, lower limb strength and substrate oxidation test), dietary assessment, anthropometric  and blood sampling were completed in week 1 and repeated in week 4 to determine changes following the program (Post-HIIT). During each training session, the HIIT and HIIT groups wore a non-thermal diffuse ultrasound belt. However, the belt was only switched on for the HIIT group. Delta change scores were calculated for ,  fat percentage (Fat%), muscle mass,  O , hip and waist circumferences, and all lipid variables from Baseline to Post-HIIT. Statistical analysis was completed using a repeated- factorial analysis of variance by group (HIIT and HIIT) and time (Baseline and Post-HIIT). Results showed significant improvements in maximal oxygen uptake (HIIT; Baseline 24.7 ± 5.4 mL kg min, Post-HIIT 28.1 ± 5.5 mL kg min and HIIT; Baseline 28.4 ± 5.9 mL kg min, Post-HIIT 31.4 ± 5.5 mL kg min) for both groups. Significant decreases in Fat% (HIIT; Baseline 32.7 ± 3.2%, Post-HIIT 28.9 ± 3.5% and HIIT; Baseline 28.9 ± 3.5%, Post-HIIT 28.9 ± 3.4% kg), waist circumference (HIIT; Baseline 95.8 ± 9.6 cm, Post-HIIT 89.3 ± 8.9 cm and HIIT; Baseline 104.3 ± 3.5 cm, Post-HIIT 103.6 ± 3.4 cm) and triglycerides (HIIT; -29.2%, HIIT; -6.7%) were observed in the HIIT group only. These results show that HIIT combined with LOFU was an effective intervention to improve  composition, lipid profile, and fitness.

A total of 26 adolescents were included in the PK analysis (14 from the mid-dose group and 12 from the top-dose group).At Day 56, arithmetic means of terminal elimination half-life (T ), apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vc/F) were consistent across dose levels for both PHEN and TPM. Arithmetic means of CL/F and Vc/F for PHEN and TPM administered as a combination in adolescents with obesity were within 10%-30% of those previously assessed in adults with obesity enrolled in Phase II and III studies. A higher proportion of adolescents in both the mid- and top-dose groups (13.3% and 50.0%, respectively) compared with placebo (0.0%) reached ≥5%  loss at Day 56. The least square (LS) mean change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to Week 56 was -5.2 mmHg for the placebo group, -2.5 mmHg for the mid-dose group, and -5.5 mmHg for the top-dose group. The LS mean change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline to Day 56 was -2.4 mmHg for the placebo group, +3.8 mmHg for the mid-dose group, and +2.0 mmHg for the top-dose group. Participants in the top-dose group had increases in heart rate from baseline of 4.1 bpm while participants in the mid-dose group experienced a mean decrease in heart rate of 4.5 bpm at Day 56. Both PHEN/TPM dose combinations were safe and well tolerated.Treatment of adolescents with obesity using a fixed-dose combination of phentermine/topiramate for 8 weeks resulted in exposure to PHEN and TPM that was comparable to that observed in adults, statistically significant  loss, and a tolerable safety profile. These data indicate that both mid- and top-doses are appropriate for longer term safety and efficacy studies in adolescents. This article is protected by copyright.

In this study, seawater, sediment, and marine species (10 fish and 9 invertebrate species) collected from Laizhou Bay, North China, were analyzed to investigate the levels, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification of OPFRs in a marine food web. Of 20 OPFRs screened for, 17 were quantifiable in seawater, sediment, and organisms. The ∑OPFRs concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 28.4 ng/L in seawater, 0.1-96.9 ng/g dry  in sediment, and 21.1-3510 ng/g lipid  in organisms. Benthic fish accumulated more OPFRs than pelagic fish and invertebrates. A linear and significant increase of bioaccumulation factors with increasing lipophilicity of OPFRs was observed ( = 0.63,  < 0.05), and the biota-sediment accumulation factors increased with hydrophobicity up to log  = 4.59 and then decreased with increase in log .

Inverse dynamics and static optimization were used to determine muscle forces. AT cross sectional area was measured with ultrasound. AT force was divided by cross sectional area to determine stress while strain was determined from previous data. Two-way repeated  analysis of variance (α=0.05) compared several variables (vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), ankle and knee angle, ankle joint muscle moment arm, external ankle moment arm, AT tendon force, stress, and strain) between movements (jump-landings) and directions (AP/ML).AT loading was higher during jump than land in the ML compared to AP direction. VGRF was higher during land versus jump with no direction effect (AP/ML). An interaction showed a higher VGRF during the AP land and ML jump. The ankle joint moment arm was lower in jump and AP direction at peak tendon stress. External ankle moment arm at peak tendon stress was higher in jump and ML direction with an interaction. A larger external ankle moment arm occurred in ML but the change was less in the jump.Higher tendon loading occurred during the jump and ML direction.

Identifying patients' needs for information about COPD is the key to individualized care. This study aimed to assess self-reported needs for information about COPD in primary care patients with either moderate (GOLD 2) or severe (GOLD 3) COPD and identify patient characteristics and exacerbation patterns associated with the findings. A cross-sectional study. Twenty-four PHCCs in Stockholm, Sweden. Randomly selected primary care patients with COPD in GOLD stages 2 and 3 ( = 542). The Lung Information Needs Questionnaire (LINQ) was used to assess perceived information needs. Spirometry results and descriptive, self-reported data on patient factors such as exacerbation history, treatment, smoking, /height, comorbidities, health care contacts, education and symptoms were collected. Overall, the greatest reported needs were for information about self-management and diet. GOLD 2 patients (68%) expressed greater needs for information than GOLD 3 patients (32%). We found significant associations between high information needs and patient-related factors such as 'No assigned GP' (OR = 4.32 [95% CI 2.65-7.05]) and 'No contact with COPD nurse in the past 12 months' (OR = 1.83 [95% CI 1.19-2.81]). COPD patients felt they knew too little about self-management of their disease. Low information needs were strongly associated with continuity in patient-GP consultations and moderately associated with contact with a COPD nurse. These associations were strongest in patients with moderate COPD. As patients with COPD often have multimorbidity, identifying patients' needs for information about COPD is essential to providing individualized patient education and care. In this study of 542 patients from 24 Swedish primary care centers, we found that:Patients with COPD, particularly those with moderate airflow limitation (i.e. GOLD 2) felt they needed more information about COPD than currently provided by health care professionals in primary care.Low information needs were strongly associated with continuity in patient-GP consultations and moderately associated with contact with a COPD nurse. GPs' part in COPD patient education should not be overlooked, as individualized COPD care relies on GPs' expertise in managing patients with multimorbidity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695914>Associations between self-reported diabetes mellitus, disordered eating behaviours, /shape overvaluation, and health-related quality of life.</a></h1><p>Eating disorders (ED) and disordered eating behaviours (DEB) have been found to be common in people with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, findings have been inconsistent.This study investigated the association between self-reported diabetes (Type 1 or 2) with ED/DEB (binge eating, subjective binge eating or loss of control overeating, severe dieting and purging) /shape overvaluation, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a household survey in South Australia.In 2017 2977 people aged ≥15 years, who were representative of the general population, were interviewed. Participants reported their gender, age, household income, highest educational attainment, area of residence, presence of DM, ED/DEB, level of overvaluation, current HRQoL and height and . For the analyses between ED/DEB, self-reported DM and HRQoL, a grouping variable was created: 1) people without ED/DEB or self-reported DM; 2) people without ED/DEB and with self-reported DM; 3) people with ED/DEB and without self-reported DM; and 4) people with ED/DEB and self-reported DM. Analyses were stratified by sex and age group.Subjective binge eating prevalence was higher in people with self-reported DM (6.6% vs 2.8%,  = 0.016), and overvaluation was lower in those with DM (36% vs 43.8%,  = 0.007). In analyses stratified by sex and age group, subjective binge eating was higher in women and in people over 45 years with self-reported DM and overvaluation was lower in men and in people over 45 years with self-reported DM. However, these differences were not significant on tests of gender and age interaction. People in both DM groups scored significantly lower than people without DM groups on physical HRQoL. In contrast, people in both ED/DEB groups scored lower than people without ED/BEB on mental HRQoL.People with self-reported DM had a higher prevalence of subjective binge eating, a lower prevalence of overvaluation and there were no significant effects of age or gender. Furthermore, participants with self-reported DM and comorbid ED or DEB had impairments of both mental and physical HRQoL. Assessing an individual's sense of control over eating along with other DEB is likely important for identification of these mental health problems.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693975>Alleviating effects of silicate, selenium, and microorganism fertilization on lead toxicity in ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe).</a></h1><p>The aim of this work was exploring the effects of silicon, selenium, and a microorganism fertilizer on alleviating the effects of lead (Pb) toxicity in ginger. Ginger plants were grown in soil containing 500 mg/kg Pb(NO) without (CK) or with Si, Se, or microorganism fertilizer (T1, T2, T3) as soil conditioners. Morphology indexes, Pb accumulation and distribution rates, and antioxidant enzyme activities were investigated.

Throughout the season, injuries were registered continuously by the (para-)medical staff of the included clubs. We analyzed the injury risk using multilevel Poisson regression models, accounting for club and team clustering.Of the included 314 players (11.7±1.7 years of age), 160 players sustained 133 overuse and 163 acute injuries (i.e. 106 injuries in 69 players of the younger group, 190 in 91 players of the older group). In the younger group, risk of overuse injuries was associated with an increase in leg length over the season (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.620 [95% CI 1.230-2.117]) and risk of acute injuries with relatively younger age (IRR 1.003 [95% CI 1.000-1.006]). In the older group, a higher leg length was associated with an increased risk of overuse injuries (IRR 1.055 [95% CI 1.011-1.108]), and a higher  and a lower growth rate with an increased risk of acute injuries (IRR 1.043 [95% CI 1.021-1.067] and 0.903 [95% CI 0.831-0.981], respectively).Injury risk factors differ by age group and type of injury.

TKA may lead to several perioperative complications. These include anesthesia-related risks, exacerbation of comorbid medical issues and complications of surgical procedure. We have no studies reporting medical complications following TKA among our population. This study aimed to evaluate perioperative complications of TKA and to identify the related risk factors.It was a monocentric retrospective including 410 observations in the local TKA registry. Data of patients operated for primary unilateral TKA during the period from January 2014 to December 2017 were reviewed. All patients had standardized protocols of anesthesia and post operative care for three days following surgery. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the predicting factors for complications.Incidence of perioperative complications was 37.1%. The most frequent were per operative hypotension (14.1%) and postoperative desaturation (21.7%, including pulmonary embolism in 2.4%).

Prevalence was calculated by counting the number of published mixed-methods studies divided by the number of published studies over 5 years. Three reviewers independently performed methodological assessment using a checklist based on guidelines by expert methodologists.Prevalence of mixed-methods studies was 1.89%. Concerning methodological assessment, of 175 studies, 29% did not provide an explicit label of the study design and four studies incorrectly labeled the design. In total, 31% of the studies did not justify using mixed methods, 95% did not identify the research paradigm, and 78% did not state the  given to individual phases. The extent of data integration was 73%, but 83% of studies integrated data using narrative summaries with integration occurring at the interpretation (69.8%). Few studies used joint displays (10.9%), transformation (3.1%), and triangulation (1.6%) for data integration.Mixed-methods research is still in its infancy in nursing, and researchers encounter challenges during its conduct, analysis, and reporting. There is a need to determine researchers' attitudes and challenges toward using mixed methods and educate them about advanced mixed methods. Emphasis should be placed on use of advanced data integration methods so that the rigor and quality of mixed research can be enhanced in nursing research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695123>Physiological and economic benefits of abandoning invasive surgical procedures and enhancing animal welfare in swine production.</a></h1><p>Food-animal welfare is a major ethical and social concern. Pork is the most consumed meat worldwide, with over a billion pigs slaughtered annually. Most of these pigs routinely undergo painful surgical procedures (surgical castration, tail docking, teeth clipping), which farmers often reluctant to avoid, claiming it would increase cost and reduce production efficiency. Herein, this study indicates that these procedures compromise pigs' health and condition. Replacing surgical castration with immunocastration, avoiding tail docking and teeth clipping, and providing environmental enrichment, resulted in significant increase in  gain, lowered risks for injuries and death, and reduced saliva and hair cortisol, both biomarkers for stress. Testosterone and DHEA analyses confirmed that immunocastration was an effective alternative to surgical castration. Economic models for the entire US swine market revealed that following across-the-board acceptance of this management, pork meat price is expected to drop, while the total annual social welfare (combined consumer and producer surplus) is expected to increase by $US 1.48 to 1.92 billion. In conclusion, sustainable swine farming management can be beneficial for both animals and farmers. Applying such welfare-friendly management is expected to reduce stress, enhance piglet/pig welfare and production, and improve the economics of swine operations in the global agro-food system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693787>Prevalence and Risk Factors Associated with Malnutrition among Adolescents in Rural Tanzania.</a></h1><p>To determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with malnutrition among adolescents in a rural Tanzanian community.Cross-sectional survey of 1,226 randomly selected adolescents from the Dodoma Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in the Chamwino district in the Dodoma region. Anthropometric measurements for  and height were collected. Height-for-age-z-scores (HAZs) and  Mass Index (BMI)-for-age-z-scores (BAZs) were computed. Descriptive estimates were documented in graphs and tables, and weighted linear regression models were used to examine predictors of malnutrition.Stunting prevalence was 18% and thinness prevalence was 14%. Overweight and obesity affected 5.23% of participants. Girls had higher HAZs (β: 0.46, 95% CI 0.33, 0.59, p<.0001) and BAZs (β: 0.20, 95% CI 0.05, 0.35, p=0.0098) than boys. Age was inversely associated with HAZs (β: -0.13, 95% CI -0.17, -0.08, p<.0001) and BAZs (β: -0.05, 95% CI -0.10, -0.004, p=0.0327). Wealth score (β: 0.10, 95% CI 0.04, 0.16, p=0.0009) and dietary diversity score (β: 0.04, 95% CI 0.01, 0.07, p=0.0080) were positively associated with HAZs and BAZs. Out-of-school adolescents had higher HAZs (β: -0.49, 95% CI -0.75, -0.23, p=0.0003) and BAZs (β: -0.68, 95% CI -0.99, -0.37, p<.0001) than adolescents who attended school.There are substantial variations of HAZs and BAZs across gender, age, education, and wealth, with an emerging burden of overweight and obesity among adolescents in this rural population.

Here, we investigated mechanisms by which a destabilizing HA mutation, Y17H (activation pH 6.0), attenuates virus replication and pathogenicity in DBA/2 mice, compared to wild-type (WT; activation pH 5.5). Extracellular lung pH was measured to be near neutral (pH 6.9-7.5). WT and Y17H viruses had similar environmental stability at pH 7.0; thus, extracellular inactivation was unlikely to attenuate Y17H virus. The Y17H virus had accelerated replication kinetics in MDCK, A549, and Raw264.7 cells when inoculated at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell. The destabilizing mutation also increased early infectivity and type I interferon (IFN) responses in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs). In contrast, the HA-Y17H mutation reduced replication in murine airway mNEC and mTEC cultures and attenuated virus replication, virus spread, severity of infection, and cellular infiltration in the lungs of mice. Normalizing virus infection and  loss in mice by inoculating them with Y17H virus at a dose 500-fold higher than that of WT virus revealed that the destabilized mutant virus triggered the upregulation of more host genes and increased type I IFN responses and cytokine expression in DBA/2 mouse lungs. Overall, HA destabilization decreased virulence in mice by boosting early infection in DCs, resulting in greater activation of antiviral responses, including type I IFN. These studies reveal HA stability may regulate pathogenicity by modulating IFN responses. Diverse influenza A viruses circulate in wild aquatic birds, occasionally infecting farm animals. Rarely, an avian- or swine-origin influenza virus adapts to humans and starts a pandemic. Seasonal and many universal influenza vaccines target the HA surface protein, which is a key component of pandemic influenza. Understanding HA properties needed for replication and pathogenicity in mammals may guide response efforts to control influenza. Some antiviral drugs and broadly reactive influenza vaccines that target the HA protein have suffered resistance due to destabilizing HA mutations that do not compromise replicative fitness in cell culture. Here, we show that despite not compromising fitness in standard cell cultures, a destabilizing H1N1 HA stalk mutation greatly diminishes viral replication and pathogenicity in vivo by modulating type I IFN responses. This encourages targeting the HA stalk with antiviral drugs and vaccines as well as reevaluating previous candidates that were susceptible to destabilizing resistance mutations.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693022>Multi-component supramolecular fibers with elastomeric properties and controlled drug release.</a></h1><p>Supramolecular materials based on hydrogen bonding ureido-pyrimidinones (UPy) are highly versatile substrates for tissue engineering, as they provide a platform in which specific functions can be introduced in a modular fashion by means of components with matching supramolecular motifs. In this work, a core-shell fiber mesh is generated by coaxial electrospinning of a robust elastomeric UPy-poly(hexamethylene carbonate) (UPy-PC) core with a hydrophilic shell of poly(ethylene glycol) (UPy-PEG), which is exploited to confer drug release properties to the load-bearing core. The effect of PEG chain length and supramolecular crosslink density on mechanical properties and drug elution profiles is investigated. Hydrated UPy-PC/UPy-PEG meshes containing 30 mol% of UPy-PEG have a Young's modulus matching that of UPy-PC meshes of approximately 0.5 MPa, and elongation at break of 600%. Drug release experiments with low molecular  drugs encapsulated in the UPy-PEG shell during electrospinning reveal a combined role of drug and matrix hydrophilicity on the elution profile. Our results indicate that a hydrophobic drug is retained in the UPy-PEG shell for several days with a maximum drug release of 56 ± 8% after 14 days, a highly water soluble drug undergoes burst release within one day, and the UPy-modification of a highly water soluble compound increases its retention in the UPy-PEG shell up to multiple weeks. Taken together, our results indicate that the proposed multi-component system is a drug delivery vehicle of excellent versatility for applications requiring strong and durable materials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691741>Evaluation of chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effect of Artemisia vulgaris extract against diethylnitrosamine induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis in Balb C mice.</a></h1><p>The main objective of current study was to investigate the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activity of Artemisia vulgaris extract on diethylnitrosoamine induced hepatocarcinogenesis in Balb C mice. Diethylnitrosoamine (DEN: 0.9%) was prepared to induce hepatocarcinoma in Balb C mice. The extract Artemisia vulgaris (AV) was prepared by maceration technique. Mice were classified into four groups as follows: Group 1 a control group (N=7) received saline solution (3.5 μl/mg), group 2 (N=14) received diethylnitrosoamine (3.5 μl/mg) intraperitoneally once in a week for eight consecutive weeks, group 3 (N=7) received only plant extract (AV: 150 mg/kg () once in a week, while group 4 (N=7) was given in combination of diethylnitrosoamine (3.5 μl/mg) and plant extract (AV: 150 mg/kg (). After eight weeks of DEN administration, mice of group 2 were divided into two subgroups containing seven mice each; subgroup 1 was sacrificed while subgroup 2 was treated with plant extract only (150 mg/kg ()) once in a week for eight consecutive weeks. The DEN injected mice significant decline in levels of albumin with concomitant significant elevations such as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alpha feto protein, gamma glutamyl transferase, 5 nucleotidase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and bilirubin. The administration of A. vulgaris significantly decreased the DEN induced hepatotoxicity. Present study revealed the potential anti-cancerous nature of Artemisia vulgaris, both in case of chemopreventive and post-treatment of A. vulgaris.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing resuscitation fluids in septic shock were carried out by retrieving electronic databases. NMAs of 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) were conducted using the STATA 15.0 software. Probability-based ranking and surface under cumulative ranking (SUCRA) were performed to identify the optimal resuscitation fluid. Inconsistencies were evaluated by node-splitting analysis and a loop-specific approach. Furthermore, publication bias was analyzed by funnel plots. A total of 13 RCTs were enrolled in the analysis. The NMA results revealed that no significant differences were detected in the outcomes of 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality among various resuscitation fluids. The SUCRAs (the first indicates the best) of 28-day mortality showed that the hypertonic sodium chloride/hydroxyethyl starch 40 solution ranked the highest (93.8%), followed by the balanced solution (BS) (69.6%), and albumin (61.9%). On the other hand, the SUCRAs of 90-day mortality revealed that gelatin (GEL) ranked the highest (75.1%), followed by BS (55.1%), and NS (52.4%). The NMA results of AKI demonstrated that high-molecular- hydroxyethyl starch (H-HES) was associated with increased risk of AKI in comparison with GEL, BS, and L-HES. The SUCRAs of AKI showed that GEL ranked the highest (74.4%), followed by NS (64.9%), and BS (58.3%). In addition, the NMA results of RRT revealed that H-HES was associated with an increased need for RRT in comparison with BS and NS, and L-HES was associated with increased need of RRT in comparison with BS. The SUCRAs of RRT revealed that NS ranked the highest (91.6%), followed by BS (74.4%) and L-HES (36.1%). No significant inconsistencies were shown by the node-splitting analysis and no publication bias was demonstrated in the funnel plots. In conclusion, BS was determined as the preferred resuscitation fluid for septic shock. Moreover, the use of GEL requires further evaluation. H-HES was associated with a significant risk of AKI and RRT, whereas L-HES with an increased need for RRT compared with BS. Thus, both resuscitation fluids should be avoided for septic shock.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695269>Bisphosphonate associated femoral stress fracture distal to an orthopaedic implant: They are predictable!</a></h1><p>Stress fractures are uncommon and often occur in young athletes with high intensity physical activity. These stress fractures occur in  bearing long bones. Recent literature suggests association of thigh pain, tension side cortical thickening of femoral shaft or a femoral subtrochanteric atypical stress fractures in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy. The reports of peri-implant bisphosphonate associated atypical stress fractures are very rare. We describe a series of three cases of femoral shaft stress phenomenon around orthopaedic implants who presented with similar prodromal thigh pain and tension side cortical thickening. Two patients sustained fractures as the condition was not recognised despite presenting with prodromal symptoms and one patient with a stress riser who was treated prophylactically. Thus this series aims to highlight the importance of identifying the stress phenomenon around orthopaedic implants, be it intra or extra-medullary implants. The location of these fractures is just distal to the implants and are classically transverse fractures. The treatment of peri-implant stress fractures needs a personalised approach in every case with appropriate choice of implants.© 2019 Delhi Orthopedic Association.

In contrast, isotretinoin is widely prescribed in Brazilian private clinics.To describe the use of isotretinoin for treating acne in a Brazilian public hospital, and to analyze whether its prescription is effective or belated.Retrospective cohort study in a public hospital.Clinical and therapeutic data were obtained from the medical records of patients who were undergoing or had undergone acne treatment with isotretinoin in this hospital's general dermatology outpatient clinic over the last seven years, up to April 2018.1526 medical records from patients with acne were analyzed. Isotretinoin was prescribed for 279 patients (18.28%) with mild (1.19%), moderate (57.37%), severe (35.85%) or conglobata (5.57%) forms of acne vulgaris. Sequelae of acne were present at the start of most of these patients' treatment. An initial daily dose of 20 mg was usually prescribed. The average initial dose/ ratio was 0.33 mg/kg/day. The average total dose/ ratio was 127.61 mg/kg. There were only a few cases of laboratory abnormalities.Sequelae of acne at the onset of treatment reveal delayed indication of isotretinoin, which can have negative psychosocial impacts on quality of life. Isotretinoin should be indicated early to prevent this.

Hence, it poses a risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome increases with age. Nesfatin-1, which affects different systems, has recently been discovered as a regulatory peptide molecule. With the discovery of nesfatin-1, it has been reported to inhibit the intake of nutrients and have significant regulatory effects on energy metabolism. As nesfatin-1 is present in both central and peripheral tissues, it is thought to have many functions. In addition to its suppressive effect on food intake, nesfatin-1 has also been reported to have an effect on the blood glucose level for regulating cardiac functions and affecting obesity by providing  loss.

However, there are very few studies reporting the physiological effects of cold with rain or wet-cold exposure on humans during exercise. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of rain on physiological responses during running exercise at 80% V̇Omax in the cold.Twelve healthy men (age: 21.7±3.3 years; height: 1.760±0.085 m; : 68.8±7.1 kg; maximal oxygen consumption: 67.3±5.00 mL/kg/min) exercised on a treadmill at 80% V̇Omax intensity for 60 minutes with rain (RAIN) or not (CON) at 5 °C.Rectal temperature was significantly lower in RAIN than in CON at 10, 40, 50, and 60 minutes (P<0.05). Mean weighted skin temperature was significantly lower in RAIN than in CON during exercise (P<0.05). Oxygen consumption and rating of perceived exertion were significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 50 and 60 minutes (P<0.05). Plasma lactate was significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 10 minutes and from 40 to 60 minutes (P<0.05). Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 10 minutes and from 40 to 60 minutes (P<0.05).These results suggest that rain increased heat loss during the early phase of exercise in the cold, then heat production increased and transiently suppressed cold stress. However, with time,  heat loss intensified due to increasing wet area, and then energy expenditure and plasma lactate increased due to cold stress. Therefore, rain may decrease exercise performance and affect sport safety.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695730>A potential relation between premenstrual symptoms and subjective perception of health and stress among college students: a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>A majority of women from all cultures and socioeconomic levels experience myriad symptoms known as premenstrual syndrome during the days prior to menstruation. The present study investigated commonly reported symptoms in the premenstrual phase among college students. The authors further scrutinized potential factors, including subjective perceptions of health, which may be related to the premenstrual-symptom constellation.We conducted a cross-sectional survey, which included 200 participants (mean age: 19.8 ± 0.1 years old). The subjects completed a rating of their premenstrual experiences relative to 46 symptoms in eight categories of the self-reporting menstrual distress questionnaire (MDQ) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of premenstrual symptoms. The participants also answered a standardized health questionnaire regarding subjective perceptions of health, self-rating stress, lifestyle, and demographic variables.Regardless of severity, the 10 symptoms most often occurring among the participants included skin disorders, irritability, fatigue, mood swings, general aches and pains, lowered school or work performance, backache, painful breasts,  gain, and swelling. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed subjective perception of health (β = 0.28;  <  0.001) and self-rating stress (β = 0.18;  = 0.008) as the factors most strongly related to the MDQ total scores. In addition, the 19 women who evaluated themselves as "unhealthy and stressed" had greater prevalence of severe or extremely severe physical (general aches and pains) and psychosocial symptoms (confusion, lowered school or work performance, decreased efficiency, loneliness, anxiety, restlessness, mood swings, and depression), compared to the healthy and non-stressed women.The present study indicates the prevalence of premenstrual symptoms, regardless of severity and number, among college students and suggests that negative subjective perceptions of health and stress may be related to the intensity of premenstrual symptomatology.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692739>[Ovarian pregnancy: an ultrasound challenge].</a></h1><p>Ovarian pregnancy (OP) is rare: it accounts for 3.2% of ectopic pregnancies.

We hypothesize that chemotherapy may worsen plasma amino acids (AAs) and markers of oxidative stress (MOS). Therefore, this study aimed to document plasma AAs and MOS before, during and after chemotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery patients. Fourteen normal- CRC patients were enrolled one month after surgery and scheduled for oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine combination (XELOX) therapy.

Ten 30-day-old male yak calves were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The maternal grazing (MG) group was maternally nursed and grazed, and the early weaning (EW) group was supplied milk replacer, starter feed, and alfalfa hay twice per day. Compared with the yak calves in the MG group, the yak calves in the EW group showed significantly increased ,  height,  length, and chest girth. When suffering to the potential mechanism of improved growth of yak calves, except for the enhanced ruminal fermentation, the significantly increased total volatile fatty acids, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and valerate in the caecum in the EW group could also serve to promote the growth of calves. By using 16S rDNA sequencing, some significantly increased caecal phylum and genera, which were all related to the enhanced caecal fermentation by utilizing both the fibrous and non-fibrous carbohydrates, were identified in the EW group. In conclusion, early weaning of yak calves by supplying them with alfalfa hay, starter feed, and milk replacer is more beneficial to the growth of yak calves when compared with maternal grazing and nursing, in part due to alterations in caecal microbiota and fermentation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695526>A qualitative study of patient perspectives related to glucocorticoid therapy in polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis.</a></h1><p>To determine patient experiences of glucocorticoid (GC) therapy in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell arteritis (GCA).Patients with a diagnosis of PMR or GCA were invited to participate in this qualitative study that used focus groups to explore: symptoms onset, process of diagnosis, treatment, adverse effects (AEs), and ongoing condition/s management.

Sepsis is a life-threatening dysfunction that arises when the 's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Diffuse sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture surgery (CLP) in ICR mice. 0.2 mg/kg  of atorvastatin was administrated intraperitoneally at 12 h before surgery. The survival of mice was calculated 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after CLP surgery. Two weeks later, open-field test and Morris water maze test were conducted to evaluate the protective effect of atorvastatin. Inflammatory cytokines in plasma, oxidative stress parameters, number of astrocytes, and neuronal cell deaths in the CA3 region of the hippocampus were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry. The results indicate that pretreatment with atorvastatin can increase survival percentage and improve cognitive function. Atorvastatin reversed all these alterations in parallel with a decrease in circulating levels of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α) in plasma, inhibited the activities of oxidative stress parameters (lower TBARS levels, ratio of GSH/GSSH, and activities of SOD and CAT), enhanced the activity of citrate synthase in brain, and reduced the number of astrocytes and neuronal cell deaths in CA3 region of hippocampus. Overall, our results indicated that atorvastatin exhibited protective effects on survival rate and cognitive disorders after sepsis by inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and neuronal apoptosis in brain tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693231>A Pyrene-Poly(acrylic acid)-Polyrotaxane Supramolecular Binder Network for High-Performance Silicon Negative Electrodes.</a></h1><p>Although being incorporated in commercial lithium-ion batteries for a while, the  portion of silicon monoxide (SiO , x ≈ 1) is only less than 10 wt% due to the insufficient cycle life. Along this line, polymeric binders that can assist in maintaining the mechanical integrity and interfacial stability of SiO electrodes are desired to realize higher contents of SiO . Herein, a pyrene-poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-polyrotaxane (PR) supramolecular network is reported as a polymeric binder for SiO with 100 wt%. The noncovalent functionalization of a carbon coating layer on the SiO is achieved by using a hydroxylated pyrene derivative via the π-π stacking interaction, which simultaneously enables hydrogen bonding interactions with the PR-PAA network through its hydroxyl moiety. Moreover, the PR's ring sliding while being crosslinked to PAA endows a high elasticity to the entire polymer network, effectively buffering the volume expansion of SiO and largely mitigating the electrode swelling. Based on these extraordinary physicochemical properties of the pyrene-PAA-PR supramolecular binder, the robust cycling of SiO electrodes is demonstrated at commercial levels of areal loading in both half-cell and full-cell configurations.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The authors sought to determine how arthrograms affect management of these fractures. They reviewed all lateral condyle fractures treated surgically at a pediatric level I trauma center from 2008 to 2014. They stratified patients managed with and without an arthrogram as well as by timing of arthrogram. The authors compared injury parameters, initial and postoperative fracture displacement, and complications between groups. They identified 107 patients who were taken to the operating room for attempted closed reduction, which they classified as either CRPP without arthrogram or arthrogram first and then a decision to treat open or with CRPP. Fifty-eight (54.21%) underwent CRPP without arthrogram and 49 (45.79%) underwent arthrogram. Of those who had arthrograms, 27 (25.23%) were prior to fixation and 22 (20.56%) were after fixation. There was no difference in age, , or preoperative displacement among the groups. Mean postoperative displacement was significantly lower in the no arthrogram group vs the arthrogram group (0.91 mm vs 1.68 mm; P<.0001), but it did not differ based on timing of arthrogram (P=.836). Arthrograms changed management in 4 (8%) of 49 patients who had them. There was no statistical difference in the rate of changed management by timing of arthrogram (before vs after fixation, 14.8% vs 0%; P=.060). The authors demonstrated that arthrograms may be useful for assessing final fracture alignment after CRPP, but are unlikely to result in a treatment change and are not associated with improved postoperative alignment.

Neonates born prematurely to HIV positive mothers are underdeveloped not only in anatomical terms but also in their physiological systems. Zidovudine, the first antiretroviral drug in clinical therapy for treatment of HIV has been approved for the use in preterm neonates both prophylactically and therapeutically. The present work shows whole  physiologically based pharmacokinetic (WB-PBPK) WB-PBPK model development for Zidovudine in preterm neonates of varying gestational ages to observe the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug in this vulnerable group of population. Along with the height, , post-natal and gestational ages of the preterm neonates; metabolic enzymes CYP2A6, CYP2C8 etc. were incorporated in each neonate. Different organs' composition in terms of water and lipid components, blood flow rates etc. were specified during simulations according to the gestational ages of these neonates. The following PK parameters were estimated for preterm neonates using simulated plasma profiles: AUC 2686.41 ± 123.49 μmol·min/l, Cmax 6.46 ± 0.74 μmol/l, half-life 8.98 ± 2.36 h, Mean residence time 12.23 ± 3.43 h and total plasma clearance 1.48 ± 0.19 ml /min/kg in comparison to the observed PK parameters of Mirochknic et.al clinical study in preterm neonates with AUC 2020.04 μmol· min/l, Cmax 6.10 μmol/l and total plasma clearance 1.62 ml/min/kg.

CD11c+ antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells) have been reported in human AAA samples but their role is unclear. The effect of conditional depletion of CD11c+ cells on experimental AAA was investigated in the angiotensin II (AngII)-infused apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mouse model.CD11c-diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR), ovalbumin (OVA) fragment aa 140-386, and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-ApoE-/- (CD11c.DOG.ApoE-/-) mice were generated and CD11c+ cell depletion achieved with Diphtheria toxin (D.tox) injections (8 ng/g , i.p., every-other-day). AAA formation and growth were assessed by measurement of supra-renal aortic (SRA) diameter in vivo by serial ultrasound and by morphometry assessment of harvested aortas at the end of the study.Depletion of CD11chigh MHC Class II+ cells by administration of D.tox on alternative days was shown to reduce the maximum diameter of AAAs induced by 28 days AngII infusion compared to controls (D.tox, 1.58{plus minus}0.03mm vs Vehicle control, 1.81{plus minus}0.06mm, p&lt;0.001). CD11c+ depletion commencing after AAA establishment by 14 days of AngII infusion, was also shown to lead to smaller AAAs than controls after a further 14 days (D.tox, 1.54{plus minus}0.04mm vs Vehicle control, 1.80{plus minus}0.03mm, p&lt;0.001). Flow cytometry revealed significantly lower numbers of circulating CD44hi CD62Llo effector CD4 T cells, CD44hi CD62Llo effector CD8 T cells and B220+ B cells in CD11c+ cell-depleted mice versus controls. CD11c+ depletion attenuated SRA matrix degradation indicated by decreased neutrophil elastase activity (p=0.014), lower elastin degradation score (p=0.012) and higher collagen content (p=0.002).Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695053>Dairy cows fed a low energy diet before dry-off show signs of hunger despite ad libitum access.</a></h1><p>Drying-off is one important management step in commercial dairy farms and consists of ceasing milk production artificially at a specific point in time, generally 2 months before the next calving. Drying-off typically comprises dietary changes as well as gradual or abrupt changes in daily milking frequency, which may challenge the welfare of high-yielding cows. This study investigated the isolated and combined effects of different feed energy densities (normal lactation diet versus energy-reduced diet, both offered ad libitum) and daily milking frequencies (twice versus once) on the feeding motivation of dairy cows on two separate days prior to dry-off (i.e. the day of last milking) using a push-gate feeder. During both days, cows on the energy-reduced diet pushed more than five times more  to earn the final feed reward and were nearly ten times faster to feed on the first reward than cows on the normal lactation diet. Illustrating the importance of developing more animal welfare-friendly dry-off management, these results illustrate that cows show signs of hunger prior to dry-off when provided a diet with reduced energy density, although offered for ad libitum intake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696228>Treatment with JQ1, a BET bromodomain inhibitor, is selectively detrimental to R6/2 Huntington's disease mice.</a></h1><p>Transcriptional and epigenetic alterations occur early in Huntington's disease (HD) and treatment with epigenetic modulators are beneficial in several HD animal models. The drug JQ1, which inhibits histone acetyl-lysine reader bromodomains, has shown promise in multiple cancers and in neurodegenerative disease. We tested whether JQ1 could improve behavioral phenotypes in the R6/2 mouse model of HD and modulate HD-associated changes in transcription and epigenomics. R6/2 and non-transgenic (NT) mice were treated with JQ1 daily from 5-11 weeks of age and behavioral phenotypes evaluated over this period. Following the trial, cortex and striatum were isolated and subjected to mRNA-seq and ChIP-seq for the histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. Initially, JQ1 enhanced motor performance in NT mice. In R6/2 mice, however, JQ1 had no effect on rotarod or grip strength but exacerbated  loss and worsened performance on the pole test. JQ1-induced gene expression changes in NT mice were distinct from those in R6/2 and primarily involved protein translation and bioenergetics pathways. Dysregulation of HD-related pathways in striatum was exacerbated by JQ1 in R6/2 mice, but not in NTs, and JQ1 caused a corresponding increase in the formation of a mutant huntingtin protein-dependent High Molecular  (HMW) species associated with pathogenesis. This study suggests that drugs predicted to be beneficial based on their mode of action and effects in wild-type or in other neurodegenerative disease models may have an altered impact in the HD context. These observations have important implications in the development of epigenetic modulators as therapies for HD.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The biochemical indicators closely related to fatigue, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactic acid (LD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) in the serum; liver glycogen (LG) in the liver tissue; muscle glycogen (MG); inorganic phosphate (Pi) and Annexin V in the gastrocnemius; superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities; malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS); and the 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in both serum and the gastrocnemius were detected. Morphological changes were also observed. The anti-fatigue-related proteins of the NRF2/ARE, Bcl2, and PGC-1α pathways in the gastrocnemius of the mice were detected by western blot.Anwulignan significantly increased the exercise tolerance by decreasing BUN, LD, LDH, CK, Pi, MDA, TBARS, 8-OHdG, ROS, and Annexin V levels and increasing LG, MG, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px levels, significantly upregulated the expression of NRF2 and Bcl2 proteins, which are anti-oxidation and anti-apoptosis regulators, and also activated the p38MAPK-PGC-1α pathway.Anwulignan can increase exercise tolerance and relieve fatigue in an excessive fatigue mouse model. The underlying mechanism may be through its regulatory effect on the NRF2 and PGC-1α signaling pathway. This study will provide scientific data for anwulignan to be developed as a novel and efficient component in anti-oxidant or anti-fatigue health food.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695709>Impact of Within-Tree Organ Distances on Floral Induction and Fruit Growth in Apple Tree: Implication of Carbohydrate and Gibberellin Organ Contents.</a></h1><p>In plants, organs are inter-dependent for growth and development. Here, we aimed to investigate the distance at which interaction between organs operates and the relative contribution of within-tree variation in carbohydrate and hormonal contents on floral induction and fruit growth, in a fruit tree case study. Manipulations of leaf and fruit numbers were performed in two years on "Golden delicious" apple trees, at the shoot or branch scale or one side of Y-shape trees. For each treatment, floral induction proportion and mean fruit  were recorded. Gibberellins content in shoot apical meristems, photosynthesis, and non-structural carbohydrate concentrations in organs were measured. Floral induction was promoted by leaf presence and fruit absence but was not associated with non-structural content in meristems. This suggests a combined action of promoting and inhibiting signals originating from leaves and fruit, and involving gibberellins. Nevertheless, these signals act at short distance only since leaf or fruit presence at long distances had no effect on floral induction. Conversely, fruit growth was affected by leaf presence even at long distances when sink demands were imbalanced within the tree, suggesting long distance transport of carbohydrates. We thus clarified the inter-dependence and distance effect among organs, therefore their degree of autonomy that appeared dependent on the process considered, floral induction or fruit growth.Copyright © 2019 Belhassine, Martinez, Bluy, Fumey, Kelner, Costes and Pallas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695912>Observational study of the effects of upper respiratory tract infection on hydration status.</a></h1><p>A frequent treatment recommendation during acute respiratory infection is to increase fluid intake. This is the first study to investigate whether upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) such as common cold can lead to dehydration, as commonly believed by the public.This was an exploratory, noninterventional, observational, single-center study. Subjects made 2 visits to a UK study center for assessments of dehydration, once during URTI and then 2-3 weeks later when fully recovered. The primary endpoint was a comparison of serum osmolality during vs after URTI. Complete blood count, serum urea, serum electrolytes, urine parameters (eg, osmolality, specific gravity, color), /BMI, subjective assessment of thirst, and physician assessment of dehydration were additional outcomes. Only descriptive statistics and shift tables were used.Fifty-five otherwise healthy adults with moderate to severe URTI of < 120 h in duration were enrolled (63.6% female, 94.5% white, mean [SD] age 21.0 [6.8] years). There was no evidence of dehydration based on serum osmolality (mean [SD] 287.63 [4.83] mosm/kg during URTI; 288.60 [5.99] mosm/kg after recovery). With only a few exceptions, complete blood count, serum urea, serum electrolytes, urine specific gravity, urine color, and physician ratings of hydration remained stable.  decreased > 1% in 34.0% of subjects and increased > 1% in 17.0% between visits, with similar changes in BMI. Urine osmolality varied: 14 subjects showed a decrease and 5 showed an increase, resulting in a higher mean [SD] urine osmolality during URTI (700.50 [231.59] vs 618.47 [320.29] mosm/kg). Subjects perceived greater thirst during URTI.In this pilot observational study, we found no evidence that URTIs such as common cold are associated with dehydration, contrary to popular belief.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692264>Dosage regimens for meropenem in children with pseudomonas infections do not meet serum concentration targets.</a></h1><p>There have been literature reports that some recommended meropenem dosage regimens may fail to meet therapeutic targets in some high-risk children and adults. We evaluated this observation in children using literature studies conducted in infants and children. Observed and, as necessary, simulated data from the literature were combined, yielding a dataset of 288 subjects (1 day to ~17 yr). A population pharmacokinetic model was fit to the data and then used to simulate the recommended dosing regimens and estimate the proportion of subjects achieving recommended target exposures. A two-compartment model best fit the data with , postnatal age, gestational age, and serum creatinine as covariates. FDA-approved dosing regimens achieved targets in approximately 90% or more of subjects less than three months of age for organisms with MIC's of 2 and 4 mg/L; however, only 68.4% and 41.7 % of subjects older than three months and weighing less than 50 kg achieved target exposures for organisms with MIC's of 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, for subjects weighing more than 50 kg, only 41.3 and 17 % achieved these respective targets. Simulation studies were used to explore the impact of changing dose, dosing interval, and infusion duration on the likelihood of achieving therapeutic targets in these groups. Our findings illustrate that current dosing recommendations for children over three months fail to meet therapeutic targets in an unacceptable fraction of patients. Further investigation is needed to develop new dosing strategies in these patients.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim of our study was to assess and compare the neonatal morbidity and mortality of multiple versus single very preterm infants.Obstetrical and neonatal data on mothers and preterm infants with gestational ages between 24 and 30 weeks, born during 2015 and 2016 at 11 level III perinatal centers after a surveilled pregnancy, were analyzed and compared. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS® statistics 25 and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 494 infants delivered from 410 women were enrolled in the study; 320 (64.8%) infants resulted from single gestation and 174 (35.2%) resulted from multiple order gestation (double=153, triple=21). Multiples were associated with a higher maternal age, a greater use of medically assisted reproduction techniques, higher C- section rates, more frequent full cycle use of antenatal corticosteroids, higher gestational age with adequate birth , spent less days on oxygen therapy, presented less prevalence of BPD and cPVL, needed less surgical closure of PDA and had a lower length of stay in NICU. Abruptio placenta, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preeclampsia were more frequent in single pregnancies. The multivariate analysis by logistic regression adjusted to gestational age and confounding variables did not show any significant difference on the outcomes of multiples compared to singles.The results of our study support the scientific evidence that, with the current practices, the neonatal morbidity and mortality of very premature infants are not different between those resulting from single and multiple gestations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694205>Structural Analysis of Gluco-Oligosaccharides Produced by  and Their Prebiotic Effect.</a></h1><p> CCK940, which exhibits glycosyltransferase activity, produces oligosaccharides using sucrose and maltose as donor and receptor molecules, respectively.

To date, a comprehensive review of their changes during fetal development has not been reported.The objective of this work was to collate and analyze physiological information on fetal blood and plasma volume and binding component data during development and to provide a mathematical description of these parameters that can be integrated within a fetal physiologically based pharmacokinetic model.A comprehensive literature search was conducted on fetal blood and plasma volume and binding component parameters and their changes during growth from apparently healthy fetuses from uncomplicated pregnancies. Collated data were assessed, integrated, and analyzed to establish continuous mathematical functions describing their growth trends with fetal age and .Data were available from 14 studies for blood, ten studies for hematocrit, 12 studies for albumin, and four studies for alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, while plasma and red blood cell volumes were described based on blood and hematocrit data. Fetal physiologically based pharmacokinetic parameters, including blood, plasma and red blood cell volumes, hematocrit, serum albumin, and acid glycoprotein were quantified as a function of fetal age and . Variability around the mean parameters at different fetal ages was also investigated. The growth of each of these parameters was different (with respect to direction and monotonicity).Despite the limitations identified in the availability of some values, the collected data presented in this article provide a useful resource for fetal physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling. Potential applications include predicting xenobiotic exposure and risk assessment in the fetus following maternally administered drugs or unintended exposure to environmental toxicants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695680>Long-Term Follow-Up of Significant Improvement After CAPTEM Treatment for Rare Adrenocorticotropin-Producing Cardiac Neuroendocrine Tumor.</a></h1><p>Ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome (EAS) is a rare cause of Cushing syndrome. If routine imaging examinations cannot identify the source of ACTH production, long-term follow-up observation is necessary to determine the etiology. We present the case of a middle-aged male with gradual  gain and a Cushingoid appearance over 4 years; he provided written informed consent. Laboratory and endocrine tests strongly suggested EAS, although the origin was not detected by multiple imaging methods. Bilateral adrenalectomy was performed to prevent severe complications in the patient. Two and a half years later, a cardiac mass 18 × 23 × 27 mm in size at the junction between the anterior wall of the left ventricle and the middle septum was found together with multiple bone metastases by F-FDG PET/CT, while the Ga-DOTATE PET/CT findings were negative. Biopsy of the lumbar vertebrae revealed a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) with positive ACTH staining. The patient underwent chemotherapy by CAPTEM, resulting in shrinkage of the cardiac mass and a significant decrease in the ACTH level. In the case of EAS with an unusual cause, long-term follow-up observation is necessary to determine the source of ACTH production. Cardiac NETs are quite rare in EAS, so treatment selection was also challenging. CAPTEM chemotherapy proved effective in controlling the progression of tumor growth and decreasing the ACTH level in this patient.Copyright © 2019 Lu, Meng, Xing, Yuan, Zhang, Li, Wang, Cheng, Bai, Wang, Cheng, Xiao, Pan, Li, Sun, Liang, Zhu, Wang and Lu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694213>Early Hepatic Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Changes Following Western Diet in Middle Aged Rats.</a></h1><p>To assess the effect of 4 weeks of high fat-high fructose feeding on whole  composition, energy balance, specific markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and insulin sensitivity in the liver of middle-aged rats, rats (1 year) were fed a diet rich in saturated fatty acids and fructose (HFF rats), mimicking the "Western diet", and compared with rats of the same age that were fed a low fat diet (LF rats). HFF rats exhibited a significant increase in the gain of , energy, and lipids compared to LF rats. HFF rats also showed hepatic insulin resistance, together with an increase in plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Hepatic lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol were higher in HFF rats, while a significant decrease in Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was found in this tissue. A marked increase in the protein amount of complex I, concomitant to a decrease in its contribution to mitochondrial respiration, was found in HFF rats. Lipid peroxidation and Nitro-Tyrosine content, taken as markers of oxidative stress, as well as NADPH oxidase activity, were significantly higher in HFF rats, while the antioxidant enzyme catalase decreased in these rats. Myeloperoxidase activity and lipocalin content increased, while peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma decreased in HFF rats. The present results provide evidence that middle-aged rats show susceptibility to a short-term "Western diet", exhibiting altered redox homeostasis, insulin resistance, and early mitochondrial alterations in the liver. Therefore, this type of dietary habits should be drastically limited to pursue a "healthy aging".</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692104>Impact of an incentive-based prenatal smoking cessation program for low-income women in Colorado.</a></h1><p>To assess birth outcomes and cost-savings of an incentive-based prenatal smoking cessation program targeting low-income women in Colorado.Prospective observational cohort with nonequivalent population control groups.Program participants (n = 2,231) linked to the birth certificate to ascertain birth outcomes compared to two reference populations from Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) and Colorado live births based on the birth certificate.Tobacco cessation metrics in the third trimester of pregnancy, neonatal low birth  (<2,500 g), preterm birth (birth at <37 weeks gestation), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and maternal gestational hypertension.

Thirty-eight positional candidate genes were identified within these windows, and three of them overlapped with selection signature regions. Thirteen predicted deleterious and three high impact sequence SNPs in these QTL regions were annotated in 11 positional candidate genes related to osteogenesis, skeletal muscle development, growth, energy metabolism and lipid metabolism, which may be associated with  in chickens.The use of a high-density SNP array to identify QTL which were integrated with whole genome sequence signatures of selection allowed the identification of candidate genes and candidate causal variants. One novel QTL was detected providing additional information to understand the genetic architecture of  traits. We identified QTL for  traits, which were also associated with fatness in the same population. Our findings form a basis for further functional studies to elucidate the role of specific genes in regulating  and fat deposition in chickens, generating useful information for poultry breeding programs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694978> Loss and Illness Severity in Adolescents With Atypical Anorexia Nervosa.</a></h1><p>Lower  has historically been equated with more severe illness in anorexia nervosa (AN). Reliance on admission  to guide clinical concern is challenged by the rise in patients with atypical anorexia nervosa (AAN) requiring hospitalization at normal .We examined  history and illness severity in 12- to 24-year-olds with AN ( = 66) and AAN ( = 50) in a randomized clinical trial, the Study of Refeeding to Optimize Inpatient Gains (www.clinicaltrials.gov; ). Amount of  loss was the difference between the highest historical percentage median BMI and admission; rate was the amount divided by duration (months). Unpaired  tests compared AAN and AN; multiple variable regressions examined associations between  history variables and markers of illness severity at admission. Stepwise regression examined the explanatory value of  and menstrual history on selected markers.Participants were 16.5 ± 2.6 years old, and 91% were of female sex. Groups did not differ by  history or admission heart rate (HR). Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire global scores were higher in AAN (mean 3.80 [SD 1.66] vs mean 3.00 [SD 1.66];  = .02). Independent of admission , lower HR (β = -0.492 [confidence interval (CI) -0.883 to -0.100];  = .01) was associated with faster loss; lower serum phosphorus was associated with a greater amount (β = -0.005 [CI -0.010 to 0.000];  = .04) and longer duration (β = -0.011 [CI -0.017 to 0.005];  = .001).  and menstrual history explained 28% of the variance in HR and 36% of the variance in serum phosphorus. history was independently associated with markers of malnutrition in inpatients with restrictive eating disorders across a range of   and should be considered when assessing illness severity on hospital admission.Copyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696014>Minimally Invasive Lumbopelvic Fixation for Unstable U-Type Sacral Fractures.</a></h1><p>Multi-planar transverse, U-type, and vertical sacral fractures occur from high energy trauma or as pathologic fractures and often have associated neurologic and extremity injuries. Modern treatment algorithms fall into two broad categories: 1) percutaneous posterior pelvic fixation (iliosacral or transiliac-transsacral screws) or 2) lumbopelvic fixation. Posterior pelvic screw fixation is minimally invasive but typically requires restricted  bearing until fracture union. In many cases, lumbopelvic fixation allows for a closed reduction and provides stability to allow full  bearing immediately after surgery; however, this fixation is often removed in a second surgery after fracture healing. Lumbopelvic fixation was originally described as an open procedure, minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation is a recent variation and has shown promising results with less morbidity. We present a case series of unstable U-type sacral fractures treated with minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation with staged hardware removal to illustrate the advantages and complications associated with this new technique. Ten patients with U-type sacral fractures underwent minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation from 2016 to 2019. Six patients underwent scheduled hardware removal an average of 3.5 (range 1.9-5.5) months after index surgery. Two patients did not undergo hardware removal due to short life expectancy and diagnosis of pathologic fractures. One patient was lost to follow-up. One patient had failed fracture reduction and went on to sacral malunion that required a late sacral extension osteotomy to restore her ability to stand upright. Final disposition of all nine patients with follow-up was normal standing upright posture and normal ambulation without assistive device. There were no late displacements on postoperative upright radiographs. Complex sacral fractures are a challenging injury that can be treated with percutaneous posterior pelvic or lumbopelvic fixation. Lumbopelvic fixation offers the advantages of closed reduction to restore pelvic incidence and immediate  bearing but has greater surgical morbidity than percutaneous posterior pelvic fixation and often requires hardware removal. The morbidity of lumbopelvic fixation may be reduced with minimally invasive techniques. Minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation is a treatment option to be considered for complex sacral fractures.Copyright © 2019, Shah et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693385>Low calorie sweeteners cause only limited metabolic effects in mice.</a></h1><p>There are widespread concerns that low calorie sweeteners (LCSs) cause metabolic derangement. These concerns stem in part from prior studies linking LCS consumption to impaired glucose tolerance in humans and rodents. Here, we examined this linkage in mice. In Experiment 1, we provided mice with chow, water and an LCS-sweetened solution (saccharin, sucralose or acesulfame K) for 28 days, and measured glucose tolerance and  across the exposure period. Exposure to the LCS solutions did not impair glucose tolerance or alter  gain. In Experiment 2, we provided mice with chow, water and a solution containing saccharin, glucose, or a mixture of both for 28 days, and tested for metabolic changes. Exposure to the saccharin solution increased the insulinemic response of mice to the glucose challenge, and exposure to the saccharin + glucose solution increased the rate of glucose uptake during the glucose challenge. However, neither of these test solutions altered glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, plasma triglycerides or percent  fat. In contrast, exposure to the glucose solution increased glucose tolerance, early insulin response, insulin sensitivity and percent  fat. We conclude that while the LCS-containing solutions induced a few metabolic changes, they were modest compared to those induced by the glucose solution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693435>Adaptation to Slope in Locomotor Trained Spinal Cats with Intact and Self-Reinnervated Lateral Gastrocnemius and Soleus Muscles.</a></h1><p>Sensorimotor training providing motion-dependent somatosensory feedback to spinal locomotor networks restores treadmill  bearing stepping on flat surface in spinal cats. In this study, we examined if locomotor ability on flat transfers to sloped surfaces and the contribution of length-dependent sensory feedback from  (LG) and  (Sol) to locomotor recovery after spinal transection and locomotor training. We compared kinematics and muscle activity at different slopes (±10° and ±25°) in spinalized cats (n=8) trained to walk on a flat treadmill. Half of those animals had their right hindlimb LG/Sol nerve cut and re-attached prior to spinal transection and locomotor training, a procedure called muscle self-reinnervation that leads to elimination of autogenic monosynaptic length feedback in spinal intact animals. All spinal animals trained on a flat surface were able to walk on slopes with minimal differences in walking kinematics and muscle activity between animals with/without LG/Sol self-reinnervation. We found minimal changes in kinematics and muscle activity at lower slopes (±10°), indicating that walking patterns obtained on flat are robust enough to accommodate low slopes. Contrary to results in spinal intact animals, force responses to muscle stretch largely returned in both self-re-innervated muscles for the trained spinalized animals. Overall our results indicate that the locomotor patterns acquired with training on a level surface transfer to walking on low slopes and that spinalization may allow the recovery of autogenic monosynaptic length feedback following muscle self-reinnervation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692918>Effects of aflatoxin B on reproductive performance of farmed Nile tilapia.</a></h1><p>This study evaluated the effect of dietary aflatoxin B (AFB) on growth, milt and egg quality in matured Nile tilapia (). Triplicate groups of Nile tilapia (initial  24.1 ± 2.6 g) were fed with either of four diets (Diets 1 to 4) designed to contain 0, 20, 200 and 2000 μg AFB kg diets for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks of AFB exposure, growth was significantly (0.05) different between the control and the AFB exposed treatments in both sexes. No significant differences were observed in 17β-oestradiol, absolute fecundity, oocytes volume and diameters between AFB exposure groups and the control group. However, we observed a significant reduction in relative fecundity and gonad somatic index (GSI) in females fed 2000 μg AFB kg diet. On the other hand, we observed significant differences (0.05) in gonadosomatic index (GSI), testosterone, milt count and motility between males in the control group and AFB treatments. We conclude that rearing Nile tilapia with aflatoxin-contaminated diets for a prolonged period affects milt quality, fecundity (at higher doses) and growth performance. This implies that for optimal seed production, provision of aflatoxin free diets should be part of the management practices in Nile tilapia hatcheries.© 2019 The Author(s).

Dehydrated children aged 6 to 60 months with ≥1 diarrheal (ie, loose or liquid) stool and ≥1 vomiting episode within the preceding 4 hours were eligible to participate. Participants received a single -based dose of oral ondansetron (8-15 kg: 2 mg; >15 kg: 4 mg) or identical placebo. The primary outcome was intravenous administration of ≥20 mL/kg over 4 hours of an isotonic fluid within 72 hours of random assignment.All 918 (100%) randomly assigned children completed follow-up. Intravenous rehydration was administered to 14.7% (68 of 462) and 19.5% (89 of 456) of those administered ondansetron and placebo, respectively (difference: -4.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -9.7% to 0.0%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for other antiemetic agents, antibiotics, zinc, and the number of vomiting episodes in the preceding 24 hours, children administered ondansetron had lower odds of the primary outcome (odds ratio: 0.70; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.00). Fewer children in the ondansetron, relative to the placebo group vomited during the observation period (difference: -12.9%; 95% CI, -18.0% to -7.8%). The median number of vomiting episodes ( < .001) was lower in the ondansetron group.Among children with gastroenteritis-associated vomiting and dehydration, oral ondansetron administration reduced vomiting and intravenous rehydration use. Ondansetron use may be considered to promote oral rehydration therapy success among dehydrated children in low- and middle-income countries.Copyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694560>Non-adherence to Haemodialysis, Interdialytic  gain and cardiovascular mortality: a cohort study.</a></h1><p>Patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) on haemodialysis (HD) have high morbidity and mortality rates, which are also due to the inherent risks associated with nephropathy. Non-adherence (NA) to the different demands of the treatment can have consequences for the outcome of patients undergoing HD; nevertheless, there are still doubts about such repercussions. This study was conducted to evaluate the association between NA to conventional HD and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.We prospectively evaluated mortality in a 6-year period in a cohort of 255 patients on HD in northeast Brazil. The evaluated parameters of NA to HD were interdialytic  gain (IDWG) ≥ 4% of dry  (DW), hyperphosphatemia and regular attendance at treatment, assessed as the correlation between the periods on HD completed and those prescribed. We used the Cox multivariate regression model to analyse survival and the predictors of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.With a median follow-up period of 1493 days and a mortality rate of 9.1 per 100 people-years, there were 87 deaths, of which 54% were cardiovascular deaths. IDWG ≥4% of DW was associated with a risk of all-cause mortality however presenting a borderline outcome for cardiovascular mortality, with hazard ratios of 2.02 (CI 95% 1.17-3.49, p = 0.012) and 2.09 (CI 95% 1.01-4.35, p = 0.047), respectively. No significant association was found between other parameters of NA and mortality. Subgroup analysis showed that for patients with IDWG ≥4% of DW, malnutrition, age and diagnosis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were associated with higher all-cause mortality.IDWG ≥4% of DW was identified as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and demonstrated a borderline outcome for cardiovascular mortality in patients on conventional HD. The occurrence of excessive IDWG in the presence of malnutrition represented a significant increase in the risk of death, indicating a subgroup of patients with a worse prognosis.</p></html>
