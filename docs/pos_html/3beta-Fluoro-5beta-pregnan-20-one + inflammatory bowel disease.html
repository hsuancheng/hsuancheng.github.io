Studies on risk factors and treatment of choice for pediatric CA-CDI are scarce with variable recommendations.This was a retrospective cohort study of the electronic health records of children 1-17 years with stool specimens sent for C. difficile at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from January 01, 2012 to December 31, 2016. Children with (1) CA , (2) confirmatory C. difficile laboratory testing with no other identified causes of diarrhea and (3) clinical symptoms consistent with CDI were defined as cases. Recurrent CA-CDI was defined using the above-described case criteria and onset of diarrhea within 8 weeks of primary CA-CDI.Of the 7350 children with stool samples sent for C. difficile testing, 408 had primary CA-CDI. Forty-five (11%) experienced a recurrence. Using multivariable logistic regression,  [odds ratio (OR) 7.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6-21.1] and cancer (OR 6.3; 95% CI: 1.6-24.1) diagnoses were risk factors for recurrent . Compared with children of Caucasian race, those with multi/other/unknown race had an OR of 3.03 (95% CI: 1.04-8.82) of recurrence. There was no statistically significant difference in the type or duration of therapy as a predictor for recurrent CA CDI. Six percent of children who received metronidazole were switched to vancomycin due to subjective metronidazole allergy or intolerance or metronidazole treatment failure.Recurrent CA-CDI in children in our population is less common than previously reported. This study supports first-line treatment with the standard, short course metronidazole in most cases of primary CA-CDI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661876>Target-Specific Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography for Non-Invasive and Dynamic Assessment of Early Neutrophil Infiltration in Murine Experimental Colitis.</a></h2><p>The role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of  (IBD) is still only incompletely understood. Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced colitis. Colitis was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing body weight, presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of inflammation. FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after colitis induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73.2 ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither body weight nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental colitis even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of  cell infiltrate in intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657484>Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan-induced B10 cells decrease severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced  in mice.</a></h2><p>IBD () is a chronic, non-specific,  gastrointestinal  that mainly consists of Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD are still unclear. B10 (IL-10 producing regulatory B) cells, a subset of regulatory B cells, are known to contribute to intestinal homeostasis and the aberrant frequency of B10 cells is associated with IBD. We have recently reported that B10 cells can be induced by ManLAM (mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan), a major cell-wall lipoglycan of M.tb (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). In the current study, the ManLAM-induced B10 cells were adoptively transferred into IL(interleukin)-10 mice and the roles of ManLAM-induced B10 cells were investigated in DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)-induced IBD model. ManLAM-induced B10 cells decrease colitis severity in the mice. The B10 cells downregulate Th1 polarization in spleen and MLNs (mesenteric lymph nodes) of DSS-treated mice. These results suggest that IL-10 production by ManLAM-treated B cells contributes to keeping the balance between CD4 T cell subsets and protect mice from DSS-induced IBD.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656567>Recent advances in monoclonal antibody therapy in IBD: practical issues.</a></h2><p>The advent of monoclonal antibody therapies has revolutionised  (IBD) treatment and delivered great benefits to patients. The optimal use of this class of drugs requires careful management and a clear understanding of their properties. In this review article, we consider how to maximise the benefit of our most novel biological agents, vedolizumab and ustekinumab. For each agent, we consider practical aspects including dose flexibility, evidence for use in combination with a conventional immunomodulator and the potential role of therapeutic drug monitoring. We also address positioning of the various mechanisms and agents in treatment algorithms as well as important aspects of managing patients receiving monoclonal antibodies, such as  reassessment. Finally, we look ahead to the future of monoclonal antibodies, where not only have biosimilars increased the number of agents available but there are also a range of novel mechanisms currently in late phase clinical trials.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Previous studies demonstrate differences in  severity and phenotype of Asian patients with Crohn's  (CD), including Bangladeshi Asians within the UK. No study has evaluated the impact of ethnicity on response to anti-TNFs.Our primary endpoint was a comparison of failure-free survival on first prescribed anti-TNF (anti-tumor necrosis factor) therapy in UK Bangladeshi and Caucasian patients with CD. Our secondary aims were to evaluate  phenotype, indication for anti-TNF prescription, and duration from diagnosis until first anti-TNF prescribed between groups.The records of consecutive outpatient appointments over a 12-month period were used to identify Caucasian and Bangladeshi patients prescribed an anti-TNF for CD. Information on patient demographics, ethnicity,  phenotype, immunomodulator use, outcome from first biologic, duration of therapy, and reason for cessation was recorded.In total, 224 Caucasian and Bangladeshi patients were prescribed an anti-TNF for CD. Bangladeshi patients started an anti-TNF 4.3 years earlier after diagnosis than Caucasian patients (3.9 years vs. 8.2 years: p < 0.01). Bangladeshi patients experienced shorter failure-free survival than Caucasian patients (1.8 vs. 4.8 years p < 0.01). By 2 years, significantly more Bangladeshi patients had stopped anti-TNF due to loss of response (OR 6.35, p < 0.01).This is the first study to suggest that Bangladeshi patients resident in the UK with CD respond less well to treatment with TNF antagonists than Caucasian patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625616>Amelioration of colitis in mice by Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1 by M1 to M2 macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Dysregulation of immune responses by intestine to environmental antigens leads to the chronic  ,  (IBD). Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate IBD. We now assessed if the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic colitis scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10. M2 macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to M2- macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating colitis. This article is protected by copyright.

CEs are diagnosed in dogs with chronic gastrointestinal clinical signs (>3 weeks),  changes on intestinal biopsies and where no other underlying cause is determined based on a thorough, standardised diagnostic work-up. Based on response to therapy, CEs are subclassified into food-responsive, antibiotic-responsive or steroid-responsive enteropathies. A significant proportion of dogs with a CE are food-responsive; however, there are limited peer-reviewed publications describing the clinical efficacy of the commercially available diets used to treat CE.In this study, the authors evaluated the response of 15 dogs with a CE to a commercially available dietetic food (Hill's Prescription Diet i/d Sensitive Canine Dry). The dogs underwent a standard diagnostic evaluation and did not receive concurrent anthelmintic, antibiotic, glucocorticoid or gastroprotectant therapies. The clinical efficacy of the dietary treatment was assessed by comparing the Canine  Activity Index (CIBDAI) before and a median of 13 days after dietary therapy.The authors found that the CIBDAI significantly decreased following the introduction of the dietetic food (median CIBDAI score pretreatment 9, post-treatment 2; P<0.0005).This study demonstrates that this dietetic food can be used to successfully manage CE in dogs.© British Veterinary Association 2019.

In recent years, the immunomodulating effects of vitamin D have gained a huge interest in its possible pathogenic influence on the pathophysiology of IBD. Vitamin D deficiency is frequent among patients with IBD. Several clinical studies have pointed to a critical role for vitamin D in ameliorating  outcomes. Although causation versus correlation unfortunately remains an overwhelming issue in the illusive chicken versus egg debate regarding vitamin D and IBD, here we summarise the latest knowledge of the immunological effects of vitamin D in IBD and recommend from available evidence that physicians regularly monitor serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with IBD. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for optimising vitamin D status in patients with IBD in clinical practice. Awaiting well-powered controlled clinical trials, we consider vitamin D supplementation to be an affordable and widely accessible therapeutic strategy to ameliorate IBD clinical outcomes.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

It has a vexing and waning course with frequent relapses, despite adequate maintenance therapy. Biological  agents have been available for the treatment of IBD for the last two decades, with impressive results. However, these drugs are costly and often have significant side-effects. Therefore, the benefit of aggressive treatment must be carefully balanced against the risk of serious adverse events. Despite good clinical outcomes, patients often request to discontinue the drugs because of cost and detrimental effects, especially the risk of malignancy. This review focuses on the benefits of biological treatment, strategies to de-escalate therapy, risk of relapse when these agents are discontinued and success with retreatment with the same or a similar biological agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634653>Non-invasive in vivo imaging of caspase-1 activation enables rapid and spatiotemporal detection of acute and chronic  disorders.</a></h2><p>Inflammasome plays a critical role in diverse  disorders, including cancers and Alzheimer's . It is induced by various pathogenic insults and activates caspase-1, a hallmark executor of inflammasome. Here, we developed an activatable fluorescence probe for visualization of active caspase-1. This caspase-1 probe is biocompatible, efficiently delivered into cells and tissues, and specifically emits fluorescence upon caspase-1 activation as assessed in in vitro and in vivo models of  conditions. We demonstrated efficient in vivo imaging of caspase-1 activation in early stages of various  conditions of mice models, including endotoxin shock,   disorder, transplanted cancer, and Alzheimer's . Notably, the caspase-1 probe enables detection of neuroinflammation in vivo two months earlier than cognitive impairments occur in Alzheimer's  model. We detected significant fluorescence emitted from inflamed sites, as well as their draining lymph nodes, by macroscopic imaging analysis within 30 min after systemic injection of the probe. This novel synthetic probe could be applied for efficient and rapid detection of caspase-1 activity in a spatiotemporal way by non-invasive imaging.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we assessed the impact of early IFX discontinuation on mother's  activity and on their at-risk babies.In a retrospective study of the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan database from 2011 to 2015, we compared IBD patients who discontinued IFX more than 90 days ("early IFX") with those who discontinue IFX 90 days or less ("late IFX) before delivery. We evaluated the risk of flaring, defined by new steroid prescriptions, visits to emergency room and/or hospital admissions, the pregnancy outcomes, and the at-risk babies.After IFX discontinuation, the early IFX group (68 deliveries) required significantly more steroid prescriptions than the late IFX group (318 deliveries) to control  activity (P < 001). There were more preterm babies in the early IFX group (P < 049), but no difference within the 2 groups was noticed in the rate of intrauterine growth retardation, small for gestation, and stillborn babies. Similarly, there was no increase in acute respiratory infections, development delays, and congenital malformations in babies of the mothers from the late IFX vs early IFX groups.Steroid-free remission IBD mothers are at risk for  flares and preterm babies when IFX is discontinued early in pregnancy. Continuation of IFX seems to be safe at least for the first year of life.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

NX-13 is a small molecule therapeutic designed to target and activate NLRX1 to induce immunometabolic changes resulting in lower inflammation and therapeutic responses in  (IBD). This study investigates the safety of NX-13 in a seven-day, repeat-dose general toxicity study in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at oral doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg. Weights, clinical signs, functional observational battery, clinical pathology and histopathology were used for evaluation. Daily oral dosing of NX-13 up to 1000 mg/kg did not result in any changes in weight, abnormal clinical signs or behavior. No significant differences were observed between treated and control rats in hematology or blood biochemistry. Histopathological evaluation of 12 tissues demonstrated no differences between controls and treated rats. There were no changes in weights of brain, heart, kidney, liver or spleen. Pharmacokinetic analysis of a single oral dose of NX-13 at 10 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats provided a maximum plasma concentration of 57 ng/mL at 0.5 h post-dose. Analysis of colon tissue after oral dosing with 1 and 10 mg/kg indicated high peak concentrations (10 and 100 µg/g, respectively) that scale in a dose-proportional manner. These experiments suggest that NX-13 is safe and well-tolerated in rats given oral doses as high as 1000 mg/kg with a favorable gastrointestinal localized pharmacokinetic profile, confirming NX-13 as a promising therapeutic for Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660029>Role of tristetraprolin phosphorylation in paediatric patients with .</a></h2><p>Intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury are the leading actors of  (IBD), causing an excessive pro- cytokines expression. Tristetraprolin (TTP), an mRNA binding protein, plays a role in regulating the  factors, recognizing specific sequences on the 3' untranslated region of cytokine mRNAs. TTP activity depends on its phosphorylation state: the unphosphorylated TTP degrades pro- cytokine mRNAs; on the contrary, the phosphorylated TTP fails to destabilize mRNAs furthering their expression. The phospho-TTP forms a complex with the chaperone protein 14-3-3. This binding could be one of the factors that promote intestinal inflammation as a cause of  progression.To assess if TTP phosphorylation has a role in paediatric IBD.The study was carried out on a cohort of paediatric IBD patients. For each patient enrolled, a specimen of inflamed and non-inflamed colonic mucosa was collected. Furthermore, the experiments were conducted on macrophages differentiated from blood samples of the same patients. Macrophages from healthy donors' blood were used as controls. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting analyses were performed to observe the formation of the phospho-TTP/14-3-3 complex. In the same samples TNF-α expression was also evaluated as major factor of the pro- activity.In this work we studied indirectly the phosphorylation of TTP through the binding with the chaperone protein 14-3-3. In inflamed and non-inflamed colon mucosa of IBD paediatric patients immunoblot assay demonstrated a higher expression of the TTP in inflamed samples respect to the non-inflamed; the co-immunoprecipitated 14-3-3 protein showed the same trend of expression. In the  gene expression analysis higher levels of the cytokine in inflamed tissues compared to controls were evident. The same experiments were conducted on macrophages from IBD paediatric patients and healthy controls. The immunoblot results demonstrated a high expression of both TTP and co-immunoprecipitated 14-4-3 protein in IBD-derived macrophages in comparison to healthy donors. TNF-α protein levels from macrophages lysates showed the same trend of expression in favour of IBD paediatric patients compared to healthy controls.In this work, for the first time, we describe a relation between phospho-TTP/14-3-3 complex and IBD. Indeed, a higher expression of TTP/14-3-3 was recorded in IBD samples in comparison to controls.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The global incidence of IBD is increasing, and more patients are exploring diet as a means to explain and treat their IBD. In fact, many patients strongly believe diet plays a fundamental role in the onset and management of their IBD. However, a significant proportion of patients report limited nutritional education from their provider, and providers report limited nutritional resources to aid in discussions with patients. This imbalance between supply and demand likely reflects the previous paucity of available literature characterizing the influence of diet in IBD. To address this gap in knowledge, we review the available literature to characterize the role of diet in the pathogenesis, exacerbation, and treatment of IBD. We aim to provide patients and providers with resources to better understand and discuss the role of diet in IBD, with the overall goal of improving patient care and satisfaction.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

This dysregulation is thought to relate the host  response to enteric pathogens. Macrophages play a key role in host response to microbes and are involved in bacterial killing and clearance. This process is partially mediated through the potassium efflux-dependent, cytosolic, PYCARD-containing inflammasome protein complex. Surprisingly, we discovered an alternative mechanism for bacterial killing, independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome/PYCARD. Using the NLRP3 inflammasome-deficient Raw 264.7 and PYCARD-deficient J77 macrophages, which both lack PYCARD, we found that the potassium efflux activator nigericin enhances bacterial killing. Macrophage response to nigericin was examined by RT gene profiling and subsequent qPCR, which demonstrated altered expression of a series of genes involved in the IL-18 bacterial killing pathway.

In this study, using in vitro T cell differentiation models, we demonstrate that CQ activates T cell differentiation and induces Foxp3 gene expression in a Nurr1-dependent manner. Remarkably, CQ appears to induce Nurr1 function by two distinct mechanisms: firstly, by direct binding to Nurr1's ligand-binding domain and promoting its transcriptional activity and secondly by upregulation of Nurr1 expression through the CREB signaling pathway. In contrast, CQ suppressed gene expression and differentiation of pathogenic T17 cells. Importantly, using a valid animal model of  (IBD), we demonstrated that CQ promotes Foxp3 expression and differentiation of T cells in a Nurr1-dependent manner, leading to significant improvement of IBD-related symptoms. Taken together, these data suggest that CQ ameliorates autoimmune  via regulating Nurr1 function/expression and that Nurr1 is a promising target for developing effective therapeutics of human  autoimmune .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623289>Simultaneous Assessment of Urinary and Fecal Volatile Organic Compound Analysis in De Novo Pediatric IBD.</a></h2><p>Endoscopic evaluation is mandatory in establishing the diagnosis of pediatric  (IBD), but unfortunately carries a high burden on patients. Volatile organic compounds (VOC) have been proposed as alternative, noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers for IBD. The current study aimed to assess and compare the potential of fecal and urinary VOC as diagnostic biomarkers for pediatric IBD in an intention-to-diagnose cohort. In this cohort study, patients aged 4-17 years, referred to the outpatient clinic of a tertiary referral center under suspicion of IBD, were eligible to participate. The diagnosis was established by endoscopic and histopathologic assessment, participants who did not meet the criteria of IBD were allocated to the control group. Participants were instructed to concurrently collect a fecal and urinary sample prior to  lavage. Samples were analyzed by means of gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry. In total, five ulcerative colitis patients, five Crohn's  patients, and ten age and gender matched controls were included. A significant difference was demonstrated for both fecal (-value, area under the curve; 0.038, 0.73) and urinary (0.028, 0.78) VOC profiles between IBD and controls.

IBD is genetically determined and many common risk alleles have been identified. Yet, a large proportion of genetic predisposition remains unexplained. In this study we report the identification of an ultrarare missense variant (NM_006998.3:c.230G>A;p.Arg77His) in the  gene causing Mendelian early-onset ulcerative colitis.  encodes a calcium sensor that is exclusively expressed in neuroendocrine lineages, including enteroendocrine cells and gut neurons. SCGN interacts with the SNARE complex, which is required for vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We show that the  mutation identified impacted the localization of the SNARE complex partner, SNAP25, leading to impaired hormone release. Finally, we show that mouse models of  deficiency recapitulate impaired hormone release and susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that functional deficiency in SCGN can result in intestinal inflammation and implicates the neuroendocrine cellular compartment in IBD.© 2019, Sifuentes-Dominguez et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626124>Accelerated perineural invasion in colitis-associated cancer: A retrospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>Perineural invasion (PNI) is a prognostic factor in patients with colorectal cancer. Neurotrophic factors, molecular determinants of PNI, are altered in their expression levels in patients with ulcerative colitis. In this study, we evaluated the frequency of PNI in colitis-associated cancer (CAC) and sporadic cancer.We retrospectively reviewed 778 colorectal cancers with pathological T3-T4 in 761 patients all of whom were surgically resected without preoperative treatment. The lesions were classified into either CAC or sporadic cancer based on the clinical information. Clinicopathological findings including PNI were compared between CACs and sporadic cancers. Moreover, we analyzed the risk factors for positive PNI by multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model.Ten of the cancers (1.3%) were diagnosed as CACs, and the remaining 768 as sporadic cancers. CACs were characterized by being nonobstructive and predominantly located in the rectum. The CACs had a larger size and more frequent undifferentiated histology than sporadic cancers. PNI was observed more frequently in CACs (90%) than in sporadic cancers without obstruction (45%, P = .007). On multivariate analysis, CAC was one of the significant factors associated with PNI (odds ratio: 9.05, P = .040).Our results suggest that CAC was more likely to exhibit PNI than sporadic colorectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629559>Strongyloides infection mimicking .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648574>An approach to acute severe ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>: Despite the introduction of novel therapies and treatment strategies for ulcerative colitis (UC), many patients develop acute, severe episodes, warranting prompt care and aggressive management.

Inhibition of TNF can decrease the  response, and this approach has been used in therapy of autoimmune conditions, most effectively in  (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Five anti-TNF antagonists have been developed and introduced into clinical medicine: a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF (infliximab), two human monoclonal antibodies to TNF (adalimumab and golimumab), a humanized Fab fragment of anti-TNF linked to polyethylene glycol (certolizumab), and a soluble recombinant form of the TNF cellular receptor (etanercept) which, on binding, blocks the activity of TNF. These TNF antagonists have potent activity in several autoimmune  marked by excessive production of this proinflammatory cytokine. All five of these agents are approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis and are considered “ modifying anti-rheumatic drugs” (DMARDs), having been shown to decrease pain, improve function, and ameliorate progressive joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis. The monoclonal antibodies to TNF have also been shown to be effective in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and . The five agents rarely cause serum aminotransferase elevations, but have been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury which often resembles autoimmune hepatitis and can be severe or require corticosteroid therapy. TNF antagonists are also immunosuppressive and can lead to reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B. Severe and even fatal instances of reactivation of hepatitis B have been linked to several anti-TNF agents, and routine screening for HBsAg before starting therapy with these agents is recommended. Patients with HBsAg should receive prophylaxis with an oral antiviral agent during therapy with one of the TNF antagonists. Among the TNF antagonists, infliximab has been most frequently and etanercept least frequently linked to liver injury, including asymptomatic serum aminotransferase elevations, induction of clinically apparent autoimmune hepatitis, and reactivation of hepatitis B. However, infliximab has been most extensively used and studied than the other anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies, and liver injury due to these agents is probably class specific. For these reasons, all five of these agents should be considered potentially hepatotoxic, etanercept perhaps less so that the others.

Epithelial homeostasis becomes dysregulated in Crohn's, with increased permeability, inflammation, and diarrhoea. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and show changes in . Tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNFα] inhibitor protein 3 is raised in Crohn's and regulates TNFα-mediated activation of NFκB. We investigated TNFα regulation by microRNA in Crohn's  [CD], and studied effects on epithelial permeability and inflammation.Colonic epithelium from CD and healthy donor biopsies was isolated using laser capture microdissection, and microRNA was quantified. Tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor protein 3 was characterised immunohistochemically on serial sections. Expression effect of microRNA was confirmed with luciferase reporter assays. Functional barrier permeability studies and innate cytokine release were investigated with cell and explant culture studies.MicroRNA23a levels significantly increased in colonic Crohn's epithelium compared with healthy epithelium. Luciferase reporter assays in transfected epithelial cells confirmed that microRNA23a repressed expression via the 3' untranslated region of tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor protein 3 mRNA, coinciding with increased NFκB-mediated transcription. Immunohistochemical staining of TNFAIP3 protein in colonic biopsies was reduced or absent in adjacent Crohn's sections, correlating inversely with microRNA23a levels and encompassing some intercohort variation. Overexpression of microRNA23a increased epithelial barrier permeability in a colonic epithelial model and increased  cytokine release in cultured explant biopsies, mimicking Crohn's  characteristics.MicroRNA23a overexpression in colonic Crohn's epithelium represses tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor protein 3, enhancing sensitivity to TNFα, with increased intestinal permeability and cytokine release.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Information about  control, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources is relevant to optimizing IBD management.To describe QoL and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources among IBD patients in Brazil.A multicenter cross-sectional study included adult outpatients who were previously diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's  (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). At enrolment, active CD and UC were defined as having a Harvey Bradshaw Index ≥ 8 or a CD Activity Index ≥ 220 or calprotectin > 200 µg/g or previous colonoscopy results suggestive of inadequate control (per investigator criteria) and a 9-point partial Mayo score ≥ 5, respectively. The PRO assessment included the QoL questionnaires SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L, the  Questionnaire (IBDQ), and the WPAI questionnaire. Information about healthcare resources and treatment during the previous 3 years was collected from medical records. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student's -/Mann-Whitney  tests were used to compare PROs, treatment patterns and the use of healthcare resources by  activity (α = 0.05).Of the 407 patients in this study (CD/UC: 64.9%/35.1%, mean age 42.9/45.9 years, 54.2%/56.6% female, 38.3%/37.1% employed), 44.7%/25.2% presented moderate-to-severe CD/UC activity, respectively, at baseline. Expressed in median values for CD/UC, respectively, the SF-36 physical component was 46.6/44.7 and the mental component was 45.2/44.2, the EQ-visual analog scale score was 80.0/70.0, and the IBDQ overall score was 164.0/165.0. Moderate to severe activity, female gender, being unemployed, a lower educational level and lower income were associated with lower QoL ( < 0.05). Median work productivity impairment was 20% and 5% for CD and UC patients, respectively, and activity impairment was 30%, the latter being higher among patients with moderate to severe  activity compared to patients with mild or no  activity (75.0%  10.0%,  < 0.001). For CD/UC patients, respectively, 25.4%/2.8% had at least one surgery, 38.3%/19.6% were hospitalized, and 70.7%/77.6% changed IBD treatment at least once during the last 3 years. The most common treatments at baseline were biologics (75.3%) and immunosuppressants (70.9%) for CD patients and 5-ASA compounds (77.5%) for UC patients.Moderate to severe IBD activity, especially among CD patients, is associated with a substantial impact on QoL, work productivity impairment and an increased number of IBD surgeries and hospitalizations in Brazil.©The Author(s) 2019.

Based on this, we examined the antioxidant molecular mechanisms involved in the intestinal anti- activity of the 4 ME. For this purpose, we investigated the effects of the 4 ME on the modulation of gene expression and antioxidant-related enzyme activities in TNBS model of intestinal inflammation as well as the molecular interaction between 4 ME and glutathione reductase. Our results showed that 4 ME modulated glutathione-related enzymes, mainly increasing glutathione reductase activity. These effects were related to upregulation of glutathione reductase and Nrf2 gene expression. Fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance data showed that interaction between 4 ME and glutathione reductase is collisional, hydrophobic and spontaneous, in which C4 methyl group is the second epitope most buried into glutathione reductase. Molecular modelling calculation showed Lys70-B, Arg81-A, Glu381-B, Asp443-A, Ser444-A, Glu447-B and Ser475-A participated in electrostatic interaction, Lys70-B, Glu381-B and Arg81-A acted in the hydrophobic interactions and Trp73, Phe377 and Ala446 are responsible for the hydrogen bonds. Based on this, our results showed 4 ME acted by different mechanisms to control oxidative stress induced by intestinal damage, controlling the imbalance between myeloperoxidase activity and glutathione production, upregulating the glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase activities, preventing the Nrf2 and glutathione gene expression downregulation with consequent glutathione maintenance. Finally, 4 ME interacted at molecular level with glutathione reductase, stabilizing its enzymatic activity and reducing oxidative stress to take place in intestinal  process.Copyright © 2019.

Phyto-ingredients have been evaluated for their ability to protect against IBD because of their anti- activities. In our previous study, we identified a novel derivative of chrysin (HE-chrysin) using irradiation technology, which exhibited stronger anti-cancer activity in human colorectal cancer cells than the original chrysin. Here, to determine whether HE-chrysin is a new therapeutic candidate for IBD, we investigated the anti- effects of HE-chrysin on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and dextran sodium salt (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. HE-chrysin more effectively inhibited BMDC maturation compared to chrysin, as demonstrated by the decreased levels of pro- cytokines, surface molecules, antigen-presenting ability, and T cell proliferation/activation in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BMDCs. These anti- effects of HE-chrysin were regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-κB. Furthermore, oral administration of HE-chrysin attenuated DSS-induced colitis symptoms and clinical signs in the mouse model. The protective effects of HE-chrysin treatment against colitis were mediated by decreasing Th1- and Th17-type cytokine levels.

Ral regulates tumorigenesis and invasion/metastasis of some cancers; however, the role of Ral in colitis-associated cancer (CAC) has not been investigated. We aimed to elucidate the role of Ral in the mechanism of CAC.We used wild-type (WT) mice and RalGAPα2 knockout (KO) mice that exhibited Ral activation, and bone marrow chimeric mice were generated as follows; WT to WT, WT to RalGAPα2 KO, RalGAPα2 KO to WT, and RalGAPα2 KO to RalGAPα2 KO mice. CAC was induced in these mice by intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane followed by dextran sulfate sodium intake. Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from colon tissues, and we performed cDNA microarray analysis. Cytokine expression in normal colon tissues and CAC was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Bone marrow chimeric mice showed that immune cell function between WT mice and RalGAPα2 KO mice was not significantly different in CAC mechanism. RalGAPα2 KO mice had a significantly larger tumor number and size and a significantly higher proportion of tumors invading the submucosa than WT mice. Higher expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-13 were observed in RalGAPα2 KO mice than in WT mice. The expression levels of IL-1β, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 were apparently elevated in the tumors of RalGAPα2 KO mice compared to WT mice.

In mammals, changes in the composition of the microbiota can influence many physiologic processes (including development, metabolism and immune cell function) and are associated with susceptibility to multiple . Alterations in the microbiota can also modulate host behaviours-such as social activity, stress, and anxiety-related responses-that are linked to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiota influence neuronal activity and host behaviour remain poorly defined. Here we show that manipulation of the microbiota in antibiotic-treated or germ-free adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction learning. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in excitatory neurons, glia and other cell types. Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in extinction learning after manipulation of the microbiota in adult mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, selective re-establishment of the microbiota revealed a limited neonatal developmental window in which microbiota-derived signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood. Finally, unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free mice and have been reported to be related to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and mouse models, suggesting that microbiota-derived compounds may directly affect brain function and behaviour. Together, these data indicate that fear extinction learning requires microbiota-derived signals both during early postnatal neurodevelopment and in adult mice, with implications for our understanding of how diet, infection, and lifestyle influence brain health and subsequent susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659447>Preoperative factors associated with prolonged postoperative in-hospital length of stay in patients with Crohn's  undergoing intestinal resection or strictureplasty.</a></h2><p>To investigate factors that influence postoperative in-hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients with Crohn's  (CD) undergoing  surgery.

Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on colonic tissue morphology, Th2  factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut microbiota were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine colonic architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the tight-junction protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2  factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial dysbiosis therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631466>Successful management of infliximab-induced generalized pustular psoriasis without therapy discontinuation in a patient with psoriatic arthritis.</a></h2><p>While infliximab has been shown to be paradoxically associated with the development of pustular psoriasis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloaripathies, juvenile idiopathic and , there are few cases of pustular psoriasis induced by infliximab in patients with psoriasis. We here present a 55-year-old female patient with longstanding plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis who developed generalized pustular psoriasis one month after the fifth infusion of infliximab. Given the lack of other side effects and the rapid initial response of the underlying psoriatic arthritis, we opted against discontinuing infliximab therapy, and the sixth infusion of infliximab was administered ten days ahead of schedule. Topical corticosteroids were added for the management of pustular lesions on initial presentation. One week after the sixth infusion, the pustular psoriatic lesions almost completely disappeared. No recurrence of pustular psoriasis was observed during the three-month follow-up. Our experience shows that pustular lesions associated with infliximab can be successfully managed with topical corticosteroids without discontinuing infliximab therapy or compromising therapeutic benefit seen upon the underlying condition.

Understanding the global burden of IBD is important to tackle increasing  occurrence.To investigate the GBD (Global Burden of ) 2017 Study Database summarising and critically evaluating the global burden of IBD METHODS: We presented age-standardised prevalence estimates, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and its components: years lived with disability (YLDs) and years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality. We reported these measures from 1990 to 2017 and stratified by region, socio-demographic index (SDI), gender and age group.The latest IBD prevalence and burden estimates varied widely across regions, and were particularly elevated in high-SDI countries. Despite an increasing prevalence from 1990 to 2017 (+6%), the IBD burden decreased (DALYs -12%). This decrease was driven by IBD-associated premature mortality (YLLs -26%). This measure represented a high share of  burden in low-SDI countries (86% of DALYs), whereas disability constituted the predominant component in high-SDI countries (71%) in 2017.  burden decreased particularly in children (DALYs -39% and YLLs -52%). In the last 10 years, however, prevalence plateaued in middle- to high-SDI countries and steeply increased in low-SDI countries.These findings highlight significant improvements in IBD care in the last three decades, particularly in children. The global burden of IBD and premature mortality have progressively decreased. The increase in  frequency observed in developing countries is worrying, especially considering the high associated premature mortality in these areas.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627210>Characterizing Clinical Features and Creating a Gene Expression Profile Associated With Pain Burden in Children With .</a></h2><p>There is often dissociation between  activity and abdominal pain in children with  (IBD), suggesting other factors may play a role in the pain experience.Patients (8 to 17 years) newly diagnosed with IBD were enrolled in the ALLAY Study: Assessing Risk Factors for Abdominal Pain in Children with  (). At diagnostic colonoscopy, 3 rectal biopsies were collected, and gene expression analysis was performed using Qiagen RT2 Profiler Neuropathic and  Pain PCR Array. Relative fold difference in gene expression for 84 pain-associated genes was calculated using the 2-ΔΔ Cq method compared with pain-free controls. Factors affecting pain burden (Pain Burden Interview; PBI) were analyzed, including age, sex, rectal inflammation, and gene expression. Data were analyzed using multiple stepwise linear regression and 2-tailed t tests (P ≤ 0.05).Thirty-nine newly diagnosed IBD patients were included (65% male, mean age 12.75 years [SD 2.63], 23 Crohn's , 16 ulcerative colitis), along with 3 controls. Mean PBI score was 7.73 (SD 6.4, range 0 to 23) for all patients. Age and sex were not predictive of pain burden, but  activity score was (P = 0.03). Expression of TRPV3, OPRM1, P2X3, SCN9A, PTGS2, and MAPK14 were associated with PBI score. Subsequent 2-tailed t tests comparing patients with no pain (PBI score ≦ 2, N = 11) to those with pain (PBI > 2, N = 28) confirmed differential expression of TRPV3, PTGS2, and MAPK14 was in patients with pain (all P < 0.05).Pain burden in newly diagnosed IBD patients may be linked to TRPV3, PTGS2, and MAPK14 expression, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for managing pain in IBD.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666502>Gadd45β promotes regeneration after injury through TGFβ-dependent restitution in experimental colitis.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated immune responses and impaired function in intestinal epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of  (IBD). Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta (Gadd45β) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various  symptoms. However, the role of Gadd45β in IBD is completely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the role of Gadd45β in IBD. Gadd45β-KO mice exhibited drastically greater susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and mortality than C57BL/6J mice. Bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that Gadd45β functions predominantly in the intestinal epithelium and is critical during the recovery phase. Gadd45β regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway in colon tissue and epithelial cells by inhibiting Smurf-mediated degradation of TGF-β receptor type 1 via competitive binding to the N-terminal domain of Smad7. Furthermore, these results indicate that the Gadd45β-regulated TGF-β signaling pathway is involved in wound healing by enhancing epithelial restitution. These results expand the current understanding of the function of Gadd45β and its therapeutic potential in ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634907>Improving Quality of Care in  Through Patients' Eyes: IQCARO Project.</a></h2><p>Quality improvement is a major topic in  (IBD) care, and measuring quality of care (QoC) is necessary for QoC improvement. Most QoC projects or consensus statements are designed from the health care professional point of view. Having QoC indicators designed for and fully evaluable by patients may provide a key tool for external evaluation of QoC improvement measures. The aim of the IQCARO project was to identify indicators to measure QoC from the IBD patient's point of view.An extensive review of the literature to identify indicators of QoC was performed; first the identified indicators were reviewed by a steering committee including patients, nurses, IBD specialists, and methodologists. Then 2 focus groups of IBD patients analyzed the QoC indicators to determine whether they could be understood and evaluated by patients. The final QoC indicators were selected by a group of IBD patients using a Delphi consensus methodology.An initial list of 54 QoC indicators was selected by the steering committee. The QoC indicators were evaluated by 16 patients who participated in 2 focus groups. They identified 21 indicators that fulfilled the understandability and evaluability requirements. The 10 most relevant QoC indicators were selected by 26 patients with IBD using a Delphi consensus. The selected items covered important aspects of QoC, including professionalism, patients' autonomy, information, accessibility, and continuity of care.The present Delphi consensus identified QoC indicators that are useful for developing and measuring improvement strategies in the management of IBD.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

PubMed was searched for original articles, published between 2007 and 2017, in Italian or English. The search string consisted of a combination of free text and MeSH terms with a common part that focused on HADs and a -specific part. All identified papers were screened by two independent reviewers; exclusion criteria were the following: no details of algorithms reported, algorithm not developed in the Italian context, exclusive use of data from the death certificate register, or from general practitioner or pediatrician databases. Pertinent papers were classified according to the objective for which the algorithm had been used, and only articles that used algorithms for primary objectives (I  occurrence, II population/cohort selection, III outcome identification) were considered for algorithm extraction. The HADs used (hospital discharge records, drug prescriptions, etc.), ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, ATC classification of drugs, followback periods, and age ranges applied by the algorithms have been reported. Further information on specific objective(s), accuracy measures, sensitivity analyses and the contribution of each HAD, have also been recorded.the search string led to the identification of 98 articles for IBD, 42 articles for CD, and 390 for CKD. By screening the references, one paper for IBD was added. Finally, this led to 5, 9, and 8 pertinent papers respectively for IBD, CD, and CKD. Considering the papers on IBD and CD, specific age selections were applied to focus on children and young adult populations. When a selection on age was applied for CKD, instead, it mostly considered individuals aged more than 18 years. Three algorithms for IBD, 4 for CD, and 5 for CKD were extracted from papers and characterized. Drug prescription databases were used for both IBD and CKD algorithms, whereas the hospital discharge database and co-payment exemption database were used for IBD and CD. Pathology records and specialist visit databases were also used for CD and CKD, respectively. For each  only one algorithm applied criteria for the exclusion of prevalent cases. External validation was performed only for Crohn's  among IBDs, in one algorithm.the results of this review indicate that case identification for IBD and CD from routinely collected data can be considered feasible and can be used to perform different kinds of epidemiological studies.

However, the uptake of biosimilars lacks initiatives aimed at educating patients.To explore the impact of a gastroenterologist's interview on IBD patients' acceptance for switching from infliximab bio-originator Remicade® to its biosimilar CT-P13 Inflectra®.After the interview of 138 included patients, 120 properly responded to a self-administered questionnaire to collect consent about the switch and relevant data. French national IBD patients' association (Association François Aupetit) provided an information sheet on biosimilars.93 (67.0%) out of 138 and 82 (68.3%) out of 120 patients switched treatment. 114 (79.8%) had never heard about biosimilars. Paradoxically, having heard about biosimilars was associated with a poorer chance to switch (Odds Ratio OR [95% CI] = 0.13 [0.02-0.72]). On the contrary, the more satisfied about generics, the more patients accepted the switch (OR [95% CI] = 1.31 [1.01-1.69]). There were 1.47 (Relative Risk RR [95% CI] = 1.47 [1.07-2.01]) times more chance to agree to the switch if the interview modified the patient's opinion on biosimilars.This study confirms that an organized information provided to the patient is a contributive way to enhance patient's acceptance of biosimilars in IBD.Copyright © 2019 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

Key cost-drivers of IBD health care expenditures include pharmaceuticals and unplanned care, but evolving treatment approaches have shifted these factors. We aimed to assess changes in cost of care, determine shifts in IBD cost-drivers, and examine differences by socioeconomic and insurance status over time.The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative database that collects data on health care utilization and expenditures from a nationally representative sample since 1998, was utilized. Adult subjects with IBD were identified by ICD-9 codes. To determine changes in per-patient costs or cost-drivers unique to IBD, a control population of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) subjects was generated and matched in 1:1 case to control. Total annual health care expenditures were obtained and categorized as outpatient, inpatient, emergency, or pharmacy related. Temporal cohorts from 1998 to 2015 were created to assess change over time. Per-patient expenditures were compared by  state and temporal cohort using weighted generalized linear models.A total of 641 IBD subjects were identified and matched to 641 RA individuals. From 1998 to 2015, median total annual health care expenditures nearly doubled (adjusted estimate 2.20; 95% CI, 1.6-3.0) and were 36% higher in IBD compared with RA. In IBD, pharmacy expenses increased 7% to become the largest cost-driver (44% total expenditures). Concurrently, inpatient spending in IBD decreased by 40%. There were no significant differences in the rate of change of cost-drivers in IBD compared with RA.Per-patient health care costs for chronic  conditions have nearly doubled over the last 20 years. Increases in pharmaceutical spending in IBD may be accompanied by reduction in inpatient care.

This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the risk of new onset IBD in patients with COPD and new onset COPD in IBD patients.We performed a systematic review of observational studies exploring the risk of both associations. Two independent reviewers explored the EMBASE, MEDLINE, LILACS and DOAJ databases, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the ROBBINS-I tool. Data from included studies was pooled in a random effect meta-analysis following a DerSimonian-Laird method. The quality of the evidence was ranked using GRADE criteria.Four studies including a pooled population of 1355 new cases were included. We found association between new onset IBD in COPD population. The risk of bias was low in most of them. Only one study reported tobacco exposure as a potential confounding factor. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for a new diagnosis of IBD in COPD patients was 2.02 (CI, 1.56 to 2.63), I = 72% (GRADE: low). The subgroup analyses for Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis yielded RRs of 2.29 (CI, 1.51 to 3.48; I = 62%), and 1.79 (CI, 1.39 to 2.29; I = 19%.), respectively.According to our findings, the risk of new onset IBD was higher in populations with COPD compared to the general population without this condition. Based on our analysis, we suggest a potential association between IBD and COPD; however, further research exploring the potential effect of confounding variables, especially cigarette smoking, is still needed.

We sought to identify risk factors for CRC in this population.We compared sociodemographic and medical characteristics of patients who received a diagnosis of CRC at an age of 18-49 years (early-onset) with patients who received a diagnosis of CRC at an age of 50 years or older (late-onset) and with age-matched, cancer-free individuals (controls) at a tertiary academic hospital. We collected data from all adult patients with a diagnosis of CRC from January 1, 2011 through April 3, 2017 from electronic health records. Associations with risk factors were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models.We identified 269 patients with early-onset CRC, 2802 with late-onset CRC, and 1122 controls. Compared with controls, patients with early-onset CRC were more likely to be male (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.39-2.51), have  (IBD) (3% vs 0.4% for controls; univariable P<.01), and have a family history of CRC (OR, 8.61; CI, 4.83-15.75). Prevalence values of well-established modifiable CRC risk factors, including obesity, smoking, and diabetes, were similar. Compared to patients with late-onset CRC, patients with early-onset CRC were more likely to be male (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11-1.87), black (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.08-2.65) or Asian (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.57-4.15), and have IBD (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.16-6.63) or a family history of CRC (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.89-4.25). Sensitivity analyses excluding IBD and family history of CRC showed comparable results. Early-onset CRC was more likely than late-onset  to be detected in the left colon or rectum (75% vs 59%, P=.02) and at a late stage of tumor development (77% vs 62%, P=.01).In a retrospective study of patients with early-onset CRC vs late-onset CRC or no cancer, we identified non-modifiable risk factors, including sex, race, IBD, and family history of CRC, to be associated with early-onset CRC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Accumulating data implicate a potential role of disturbed tryptophan metabolism in IBD. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a derivative of tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, displays cytoprotective and immunomodulating properties, whereas 3-OH-KYN is a cytotoxic compound, generating free radicals.The expression of lymphocytic mRNA encoding enzymes synthesizing KYNA (KAT I-III) and serum levels of TRP and its metabolites were evaluated in 55 patients with IBD, during remission or relapse [27 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with Crohn's  (CD)] and in 50 control individuals.The increased expression of KAT1 and KAT3 mRNA characterized the entire cohorts of patients with UC and CD, as well as relapse-remission subsets. Expression of KAT2 mRNA was enhanced in patients with UC and in patients with CD in remission. In the entire cohorts of UC or CD, TRP levels were lower, whereas KYN, KYNA and 3-OH-KYN were not altered. When analysed in subsets of patients with UC and CD (active phase-remission), KYNA level was significantly lower during remission than relapse, yet not  control. Functionally, in the whole groups of patients with UC or CD, the TRP/KYN ratio has been lower than control, whereas KYN/KYNA and KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratios were not altered. The ratio KYN/3-OH-KYN increased approximately two-fold among all patients with CD; furthermore, patients with CD with relapse, manifested a significantly higher KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratio than patients in remission.The presented data indicate that IBD is associated with an enhanced expression of genes encoding KYNA biosynthetic enzymes in lymphocytes; however, additional mechanisms appear to influence KYNA levels. Higher metabolic conversion of serum TRP in IBD seems to be followed by the functional shift of KYN pathway towards the arm producing KYNA during exacerbation. We propose that KYNA, possibly  interaction with aryl hydrocarbon receptor or G-protein-coupled orphan receptor 35, may serve as a counter-regulatory mechanism, decreasing cytotoxicity and inflammation in IBD. Further longitudinal studies evaluating the individual dynamics of TRP and KYN pathway in patients with IBD, as well as the nature of precise mechanisms regulating KYNA synthesis, should be helpful in better understanding the processes underlying the observed changes.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650411>Increased risk of herpes zoster infection in patients with : a meta-analysis of cohort studies.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ) infection in patients with  (IBD).

Data on HZ infection and medications in patients with IBD and controls were extracted. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the source of heterogeneity. Seven cohort studies were included that involved more than 1,000,000 participants. The RR of HZ infection in patients with Crohn's  (CD) compared with non-CD patients was 1.74 (95% CI 1.57-1.92, p < 0.001). The pooled RR of HZ infection in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) compared with non-UC was 1.40 (95% CI 1.31-1.50, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that age, race, and publication year contribute to heterogeneity. We also found that steroid users were at increased risk of HZ in CD (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-2.88). Steroid users and anti-TNFα users were at increased risk of HZ in UC, with RRs of 1.99 (95% CI 1.64-2.42) and 2.29 (95% CI 1.52-3.45), respectively. Begg's test and Egger's test suggested no publication bias. There was a 74% increased risk of HZ infection in patients with CD and 40% increased risk of HZ infection in patients with UC compared with that in non-IBD.

For example, these cation channels act as sensors in the detection and transduction of stimuli of temperature, small molecules, voltage, pH, and mechanical constrains. Over the past decades, different members of the TRP channels have been identified in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract playing multiple modulatory roles. Noteworthy, TRPs support critical functions related to the taste perception, mechanosensation, and pain. They also participate in the modulation of motility and secretions of the human gut. Last but not least, altered expression or activity and mutations in the TRP genes are often related to a wide range of disorders of the gut epithelium, including , fibrosis, visceral hyperalgesia, irritable  syndrome, and colorectal cancer. TRP channels could therefore be promising drug targets for the treatment of GI malignancies.

Most cases of renoalimentary fistulae are secondary to penetrating trauma, which may be iatrogenic or due to locally invasive benign infective processes or complicated nephrolithiasis, or following surgical procedures. Spontaneous renoalimentary fistulae developing secondary to locally advanced malignancies, namely renal cell carcinoma, are very rare, and unknown due to upper tract transitional cell carcinoma. We present a case where a 60-year-old man, presented with clinical symptoms suggestive of upper gastrointestinal tract pathology, with no urological complaints and was diagnosed to have a renoalimentary fistula on cross-sectional imaging and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with histopathology of duodenal growth biopsy showing high-grade transitional cell carcinoma. Due to unresectable nature of this mass, this patient had a gastric and biliary diversion and was started on palliative chemotherapy. Renoalimentary fistulae due to benign  causes may be treated by nephrectomy with or without resection of the involved  segment. However, all malignant fistulae have to be treated as locally advanced tumours and en bloc resection should be attempted whenever feasible.© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2019. No commercial re-use.

There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of , irritable  syndrome, and non-alcohol fatty liver .An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1.5 cm × 2.0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, he reported new hair growth on the affected region of his scalp, with some of his white hair gradually turning to black, without taking any other therapies for alopecia areata before and after FMT.FMT might act as a potential therapy for patients who suffer from alopecia areata. Large and well-designed studies are required to confirm the role of FMT in alopecia areata.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Forty patients were randomized in two study arms, in which  purgation was performed either before or after PET-MR enterography. All patients underwent ileocolonoscopy with mucosal biopsies after PET-MR within 24 h. Diagnostic performance of MR morphological parameters (MRmorph), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and PET in detecting histological inflammation determined by the Nancy index was compared with each other and between study arms. Correlation between PET and histological  severity was calculated.In study arm without previous  purgation, SUV ratio of  segment (relative to SUV of the liver) facilitated the highest specificity and diagnostic accuracy compared with MRmorph and DWI.  cleansing led to markedly increased metabolic activity of  segments, resulting in significantly reduced specificity of PET compared with study arm without purgation (0.808 vs. 0.966, p = 0.007, respectively). Inter-observer concordance for assessing MRmorph was clearly increased after  cleansing (Cohen's κ, 0.847 vs. 0.665; p = 0.013, respectively), though diagnostic performance of MRmorph was not significantly improved. Our findings suggested that the change of metabolic status was mainly associated with the grade of neutrophil infiltrate and less dependent on chronic infiltrate.PET-MR enterography was an excellent non-invasive diagnostic method in the assessment of histological active inflammation in ulcerative colitis without the need of previous  purgation.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631819>TPMT Genotype and Adverse Effects of Azathioprine Among Jordanian Group.</a></h2><p> (IBD) is a common  affecting many patients.

We also present management tools for IBD patients with acute back pain and small joint monoarthritis (Supplementary file).The reported algorithm for IBD patients with chronic back pain uses basic clinical criteria to identify which patients should be referred to the emergency room (spondylodiscitis), physical medicine and rehabilitation (mechanical back pain) or rheumatologist (spondyloarthritis). IBD patients with large joint monoarthritis should be referred to emergency room if septic arthritis is suspected; in other patients, blood analyses and referral to a rheumatologist for articular puncture with evacuation of synovial fluid are recommended. The analysis of synovial fluid allows for identification of non- (e.g., osteoarthritis) and  (e.g., [pseudo]-gout, peripheral spondyloarthritis and Borrelia burgdorferi arthritis) conditions. In patients with  oligoarticular or polyarticular arthralgia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, concomitant therapies, anti-nuclear factor and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody levels should be evaluated; in anti-tumour necrosis factor-treated patients, a drug-induced lupus-like syndrome should be considered.We propose straightforward strategies for IBD patients with joint symptoms, which are specific enough to select initial treatment and referral pattern.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634546>Leukocyte-specific siRNA delivery revealing IRF8 as a potential anti- target.</a></h2><p>Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) protein plays a critical role in the differentiation, polarization, and activation of mononuclear phagocytic cells. In light of previous studies, we explored the therapeutic potential of IRF8 inhibition as immunomodulatory therapy for  (IBD). To this end, we utilized siRNA-loaded lipid-based nanoparticles (siLNPs) and demonstrated a ∼90% reduction of IRF8 mRNA levels in vitro (PV < 0.0001), alongside a notable reduction in IRF8 protein. Moreover, silencing IRF8 ex vivo in splenocytes lead to a profound downregulation of IRF8 protein, followed by an immunomodulatory effect, as represented by a decrease in the secretion of TNFα, IL6 and IL12/IL23 (IL12p40) proinflammatory cytokines (PV = 0.0045, 0.0330, <0.0001, respectively). In order to silence IRF8 in vivo, selectively in  leukocytes, we used siLNPs that were coated with anti-Ly6C antibodies via our recently published ASSET targeting approach. Through this strategy, we have demonstrated a selective binding of the targeted-LNPs (T-LNPs) to Ly6C +  leukocytes. Finally, an immunomodulatory effect was demonstrated in vivo in an IBD mouse model with a profound decrease of TNFα, IL6, IL12/IL23, and IL1β pro- cytokines (n = 5, PV < 0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.02, respectively) and an improvement of colon-morphology as assessed by colon-length measurements and colonoscopy (PV < 0.0001). Overall, using antibody-targeted siLNPs, we showed a notable reduction of IRF8 mRNA and protein and demonstrated a targeted immunomodulation therapeutic effect ex vivo and in vivo, in the DSS colitis model. We claim that a selective silencing of IRF8 in  leukocytes (such as Ly6C+) may serve as a therapeutic approach for treating  disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the mechanism by which α-MG reduces LPS-stimulated IEC-6 cells inflammation. A genome-wide examination of control, LPS-stimulated, and α-MG-pretreated cells was performed with the Illumina Hiseq sequencing platform, and gene expression was verified with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Among the 37,199 genes profiled, 2014 genes were regulated in the LPS group, and 475 genes were regulated in the α-MG group. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that they were mainly related to inflammation and oxidative stress. Based on the transcriptomic results, we constructed a rat model of  (IBD) with LPS and investigated the effects of α-MG on NLRP3 inflammasomes. After LPS stimulation, the rat intestinal villi were significantly detached, with congestion and hemorrhage; the intestinal epithelial cell nuclei were deformed; and the mitochondria were swollen. However, after pretreatment with α-MG, the intestinal villus congestion and hemorrhage were reduced, the epithelial nuclei were rounded, and the mitochondrial morphology was intact. qPCR and western blotting were used to detect NLRP3, caspase 1, interleukin (IL)-18, and IL-1β expression at the gene and protein levels. Their expression increased at both the transcript and protein levels after LPS stimulation, whereas it decreased after pretreatment with α-MG.

Codon 139 variants are frequently observed in Asians, while multiple variants are seen in codon 18 which also cause AEs including the European ancestry. The purpose of this study is to establish a technique capable of the simple genotyping of NUDT15 codon 18 and to evaluate its efficacy.A high-resolution melt (HRM) technique is performed to simply determine genotypes. The accuracy of HRM analysis was evaluated with DNAs from 1245 Japanese patients with . Subsequently, another group of 572 patients was analyzed to verify the method. The diplotypes and the frequency of their AEs were estimated on the basis of codon 18 and 139 genotypes.The HRM analysis enabled the correct identification of the three main genotypes, ref/ref, ref/ins, and ref/V18I, in 1236 of 1241 cases. All rare genotypes including ref/del were identified as the impossible-to-determine group, the proper diagnosis rate was 99.6%. In the verification test using other samples, the diagnosis rate was 99.7%. By estimating diplotypes using both codon 18 and 139 genotypes, 2.74% and 2.13% of Japanese patients with Arg/Arg and Arg/Cys of codon 139 have a lower enzymatic activity of NUDT15 and a higher risk for adverse responses than those estimated by codon 139 genotypes alone.Our study showed that HRM method enables simple genotyping of complicated codon 18 variants essential to haplotype estimation of the NUDT15.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657630>Intestinal epithelial deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 alters expression of  mediators and barrier function.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are important hormones involved in the regulation of multiple physiologic functions. GCs are also widely used in anti-/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of , but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells .  deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic inflammation at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/ changes. This phenotype regressed substantially, but not completely, after 2 wk. The mechanism may involve augmented  signaling by epithelial cells or defective barrier function. We conclude that the epithelial GC receptor plays a significant role in colonic homeostasis in basal conditions, but its deficiency can be compensated in the short term.

Recently, it has been found that oral microbiota are involved in arthritis pathogenesis. Microbiome composition and its functional implications have been associated with the prevention of bone loss and/or reducing fracture risk. The link between gut-oral microbiota and joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis has been established, and it is now receiving increasing attention in human studies. Recent papers have demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut and oral microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). These alterations resemble those established in systemic  conditions (, spondyloarthritides, and psoriasis), which include decreased microbial diversity and a disturbance of immunoregulatory properties. An association between abundance of oral  and intestinal  in RA patients compared to healthy controls has been clearly demonstrated.

We identified elenolic acid, tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, fraxetin, verbascoside, gallic acid, procyanidin-B1, and luteolin 3,7 glucoside, in order of abundance. Measurements of total antioxidant activity by Folin-Ciocalteu reaction and ferric reducing ability (FRAP), as well as of scavenger activity towards ABTS•, DPPH•, and perferryl-myoglobin radicals, showed that the phytocomplex effectively reduced oxidants with different standard potentials. When compared with vitamin E, HME also behaved as an efficient chain-breaking antioxidant against lipoperoxyl radicals from methyl linoleate. In cellular models for oxidative stress, HME counteracted membrane lipid oxidation of human erythrocytes stimulated by -butyl hydroperoxide and prevented the generation of reactive oxygen species, as well as the GSH decay in IL-1β-activated intestinal normal-like cells. Moreover, in this in vitro intestinal   model, HME reduced the release of the pro- cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.

To systematically characterize this response, we analyzed 58,067 immune cells from the mouse small intestine by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) at steady state and after induction of a type 2  reaction to ovalbumin (OVA). Computational analysis revealed broad shifts in both cell-type composition and cell programs in response to the inflammation, especially in group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Inflammation induced the expression of exon 5 of Calca, which encodes the alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (α-CGRP), in intestinal KLRG1 ILC2s. α-CGRP antagonized KLRG1 ILC2s proliferation but promoted IL-5 expression. Genetic perturbation of α-CGRP increased the proportion of intestinal KLRG1 ILC2s. Our work highlights a model where α-CGRP-mediated neuronal signaling is critical for suppressing ILC2 expansion and maintaining homeostasis of the type 2 immune machinery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Growing evidences support the existence of exposure-response relationship with Vedolizumab, but the utility and the appropriate use of TDM in clinical practice is still under debate. In this review, we summarize all evidences supporting a TDM-guided approach for patients treated with Vedolizumab, suggesting three potential scenarios: 1) early prediction of long-term outcomes; 2) verifying the best strategy in case of loss of response, 3) maximizing therapeutic efficacy during maintenance treatment. Vedolizumab through concentrations < 20 μg/ml at week 6 and > 12 μg/ml seem to be associated with more favourable outcomes. No comparative studies have been conducted so far to demonstrate the advantage of adopting a TDM-guided versus an empirical approach for managing primary or secondary non responses.The frequency of antibodies to Vedolizumab detection is quite low (up to 4% in pivotal trials), suggesting, unlike of anti TNF-α agents, a low probability of experiencing an immune-mediated pharmacokinetic failure in clinical practice.

Although many studies underlined the role of the gut microbiota in shaping the mucosal immune system, studies on the influence of the host immune system on the microbiota are rare, especially in homeostasis. We addressed this question via comparative 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis of fecal microbial communities from wild-type and β7 integrin-deficient mice, the latter being characterized by a compromised GALT. Besides subtle changes in relative abundances of  spp. and unknown members of the families  and , there was altogether no major difference in microbiota profiles in β7 integrin-deficient mice vs. wild-type littermates. This indicates that, in conditions of homeostasis, there is only a minor influence of the host immune system on the fecal microbiota in our mouse model, stressing the potential importance of pathological factors for dysbiosis development.Copyright © 2019 Babbar, Hitch, Pabst, Clavel, Hübel, Eswaran, Wagner and Schippers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651863>Natural elimination of a video capsule after retention for 1 year in a patient with small  Crohn : A case report.</a></h2><p>Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a useful tool to differentiate small intestinal bleeding, , and other small  . The most common adverse effect of VCE is capsule retention; the incidence varies greatly depending on the underlying , which is known to increase from 1.5% in healthy individuals to 21% in patients with small  Crohn . We report this case on a patient who had asymptomatic capsule retention for 12 months and experienced natural elimination with medication.A 21-year-old woman presented to the hospital with chronic abdominal pain and persistent diarrhea for 2 years.The patient was diagnosed with small  Crohn  using VCE, and radiography revealed capsule retention.Symptoms of obstruction were not distinctive, it was decided to increase the dosages of azathioprine and infliximab to 50 and 500 mg (10 mg/kg), at 5 months after VCE. And at month 11 of capsule retention, she was admitted and started on a regimen of hydrocortisol 300 mg for 4 days and hydrocortisol injection 200 mg for 10 days.At month 12, abdominal radiography in the clinic confirmed that the capsule had been naturally retrieved.Capsule retention could be initially treated conservatively with medication and if the treatment fails, it is recommended to remove the capsule surgically.

We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota differ in health versus  (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue immunity, improve barrier function and prevent B-cell dysfunction in microbiota-associated  and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650238>Pouch wall thickness and floppy pouch complex.</a></h2><p>Floppy pouch complex (FPC) consists of  phenotypes in patients with ileal pouches, including pouch prolapse, afferent limb syndrome, enterocele, redundant loop, and pouch folding.

The aims of this study were to assess the relationship between pouch wall thickness and FPC, and to investigate the association between inflamed and non-inflamed pouch wall thickness.This case-control study included all eligible patients with FPC from our prospectively maintained, IRB-approved Pouchitis Registry from 2011 to 2017. We measured pouch wall thickness of fully distended pouches on cross-sectional abdominal and pelvic imaging. Patients with stoma and non-distended pouches were completely excluded. Risk factors for FPC were analyzed.A total of 140 out of 451 patients from our were found to have fully distended pouches on imaging. Of the 140 patients, 36 (25.7%) were diagnosed as having FPC.

Biotin deficiency may be due to congenital lack of biotinidase, or acquired following some conditions that interfere with its absorption, such as   disorders, a diet too rich in avidin, magnesium deficiency, smoking habit and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticonvulsants and sulfonamides. This review highlights the role of biotin in the most common skin disorders such associated with biotin deficiency and an approach to their treatment. Biotin administration may improve the treatment of hair loss when deficiency is detected on the basis of a careful patient history, clinical examination and the determination of serum biotin levels. The use of biotin is rationale in seborrheic dermatitis as the vitamin intercepts the main metabolic pathways underlying the pathogenesis of the . Treatment with biotin could also be useful in comedonal acne characterized by a high rate of seborrhea, and may be helpful for acne treated with topical retinoids, contributing to the control of flaking and irritation. The tolerability of biotin is excellent and there is no risk of hypervitaminosis even in the case of high doses. It is important that administration is controlled by physicians and follows a medical diagnosis and prescription.

Opioid use continues to be more prevalent in IBD than any other chronic gastrointestinal condition, and the majority of IBD patients consume narcotics during hospitalization despite the risks of infection and death.We performed a retrospective review of 57 subjects aimed at quantifying pain and opiate consumption for IBD-related admissions over a 3-month period. For each patient, the average and maximum of each day's pain scores were used to measure changes in pain from admission to discharge using mixed model regression, with opiate use as a time-dependent covariate.The daily average pain score over the entire hospitalization was 4.23 ± 2.09, and the maximum pain score was 8.28 ± 1.75. Among opioid users (n = 51), the daily average pain score was 4.65 ± 2.16 and the maximum pain score was 7.53 ± 2.56. Across all cases from admission to discharge, there was less than a 1-point change in daily average pain (- 0.96 ± 2.03, p = 0.0009), and no change in maximum pain (- 0.89 ± 3.59, p = 0.0671). Opioid users, a subset of the overall cohort, had a similar less than one-point drop in daily average pain (- 0.94 ± - 0.29, p = 0.0024) and no change in daily maximum pain scores (- 0.81 ± - 0.47, p = 0.0914). Patients on average used 20 ± 25 mg morphine equivalents per day. Opioid-naïve patients used similar doses to those who used opioids prior to admission (PTA). Almost half of all cases (47%) were discharged with an opioid prescription, the majority (71%) of whom were not on opioids PTA.Pain in IBD is not well controlled through hospitalization, with less than a 1-point change from admission to discharge, despite significant opioid consumption.

Demographic, endoscopic, and pathological findings were collected. According to the age of the patients, they were divided into 0-3 year-old group, 4-6 year-old group, 7-14 year-old group and 15-17 year-old group. The patients were also divided into 2005-2011 group and 2012-2017 group, according to the time of colonoscopy.The cohort consisted of 326 patients, including 205 boys (62.9%) and 121 girls (37.1%). In the study, 31 patients (9.5%) were in 0-3 year-old group, 28 (8.6%) were in 4-6 year-old group, 96 (29.4%) were in 7-14 year-old group and 171 (52.5%) in 15-17 year-old group.

Amygdala is a key structure in the limbic system and its related circuits are implicated in processing of emotion, pain and sensory. However, limited study of the amygdala is elucidated in CD. This study mainly investigated altered functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdala in CD patients during resting-state. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired from 42 CD patients and 35 healthy controls (HCs). Whole amygdala bilaterally were selected as regions of interest (ROIs). Voxel-based morphometry and FC methods were applied to investigate the differences of structure or intrinsic connectivity of the amygdala between the two groups, separately. Pearson correlations were performed to explore relationships between the clinical characteristics and neuroimaging findings in CD patients. Based on the whole amygdala bilaterally as ROIs, compared with HCs, CD patients showed no statistical differences of grey matter destiny but exhibited decreased FC between the amygdala and insula, parahippocampus, as well as anterior middle cingulate cortex/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. CD patients had negative correlation between the  duration and amygdala-insula connectivity. In the patient group, patients with higher anxiety or depression scores revealed increased FC of the amygdala with thalamus and orbitofrontal cortex. Our results reveal that aberrant FC of the amygdala may be involved in processing of visceral pain and sensation, and emotion in CD.

Vedolizumab blocks T lymphocytes, eosinophil adhesion, and extravasation in the gastrointestinal tract. It is not known if mucosal eosinophilia is a predictor for the therapeutic efficacy of vedolizumab.This was a retrospective cohort study of IBD patients with ileal or colonic biopsies who were off steroids before starting vedolizumab. Biopsies were rereviewed by pathologists, and mean eosinophil density was quantified. Patient characteristics and steroid-free clinical response 6 months after beginning vedolizumab were determined. Features were compared between nonresponders and responders, and multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of clinical response.Of 251 IBD patients starting vedolizumab therapy, 65 patients (48% Crohn's , 52% ulcerative colitis) met inclusion criteria. All IBD patients not responding to vedolizumab were more likely to have a higher baseline mean eosinophil count (340 ± 156 vs 236 ± 124; P = 0.004), be previously exposed to an anti-TNF (96% vs 56%; P = 0.001), and be male (58% vs 28%; P = 0.02). Mean eosinophil counts were significantly increased in colonic biopsies in UC nonresponders (438 ± 149 vs 299 ± 145; P = 0.01). A similar trend was seen in CD nonresponders. On multivariable analysis, colonic eosinophil density and prior anti-TNF exposure-and the combination of both-were independent predictors of response.In ulcerative colitis, colonic eosinophilia and prior anti-TNF exposure were independent predictors of 6-month clinical nonresponse to vedolizumab. Mucosal eosinophil density as a novel biomarker should be explored in larger patient cohorts.Aside from the previous anti-TNF exposure, eosinophil density in the colon of patients with UC is a negative predictor for a steroid-free long-term response to vedolizumab.

Several systemic  conditions have been linked to an increased risk of ASCVD; however, this has not been well established in  (IBD). IBD is comprised of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's , both of which involve chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, often with evidence of systemic involvement. Several ASCVD risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, poor diet and the presence of obesity may increase the risk of ASCVD in patients suffering from IBD, despite a lower prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Medications used to treat IBD and target inflammation, such as steroids, may also accelerate the risk of the risk for ASCVD heart failure while exacerbating ASCVD risk factors. Several studies have demonstrated an elevated risk of acute myocardial infarction and stroke in these patients, most notably in women and in younger patients. Some cohort studies have also suggested a link between IBD and both atrial fibrillation and heart failure, particularly during periods of active flares. All IBD patients, particularly younger individuals, should be screened for ASCVD risk factors with aggressive risk factor modification to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Further research is needed to identify how to prevent and treat cardiovascular events that occur in patients with IBD, particularly during active flares.Copyright © 2019.

However, whether miR-219a-5p is involved in the pathogenesis of  (IBD) remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-219a-5p expression was significantly decreased in the inflamed intestinal mucosa and peripheral blood (PB)-CD4 T cells from patients with IBD. Proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and TNF-α) inhibited miR-219a-5p expression in CD4 T cells in vitro. Lentivirus-mediated miR-219a-5p downregulation facilitated Th1/Th17 cell differentiation, whereas miR-219a-5p overexpression exerted an opposite effect. Luciferase assays confirmed that ETS variant 5 (ETV5) was a functional target of miR-219a-5p and ETV5 expression was significantly increased in the inflamed intestinal mucosa and PB-CD4 T cells from IBD patients. ETV5 overexpression enhanced Th1/Th17 immune response through upregulating the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT4. Importantly, supplementation of miR-219a-5p ameliorated TNBS-induced intestinal mucosal inflammation, characterized by decreased IFN-γ CD4 T cells and IL-17A CD4 T cells infiltration in the colonic lamina propria.

TNF inhibitors still represent the first biologic after conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) in the majority of patients according to registry data. This was possibly because they were historically the first biological agents available (biological DMARDS with a different mechanism of action or targeted synthetic DMARDs did not become available until 2006s), and so switching from one to another was frequent in the case of an inadequate response and/or side effects. TNF inhibitors are also efficacious for other  joint and spine , and have been approved for , uveitis and psoriasis. In addition, national registries have provided long-term safety data and demonstrated their beneficial effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, approximately 30-40% of patients discontinue anti-TNF treatment because of primary failure, secondary loss of response, or intolerance. The options for managing anti-TNF treatment failures include switching to an alternative anti-TNF (cycling) or to another class of targeted drug with a different mechanism of action (swapping).

Carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the  process are discovered gradually. The undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and inflammation occurs by altering colonic microbiome. ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty acids due to its less pro- properties. High fibers produce more short-chain fatty acids in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic microbiota. Moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. Low FODMAP is recommended in IBS and is also suggested in patients of IBD with IBS-like symptoms. Specific Carbohydrate Diet was designed for celiac  at first and is proved to be effective to decrease inflammation and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric CD in many literatures. Paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. These findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level. Some more well-designed studies with randomization and double-blind are needed and the primary endpoints should be more focused on the decrease of inflammation in pathology and mucosal healing in endoscopy instead of relief of the symptoms.Copyright © 2019.

Meanwhile, neither  nor intake of non-steroid anti- drugs were associated with CML, indicating that it is not gastrointestinal ulcer or inflammation per se which influences risk.The consistent associations suggest a shared background between gastric conditions and CML, and strengthens the case that Helicobacter pylori could constitute this common risk factor.As the aetiology of CML is practically unknown, and Helicobacter pylori could potentially be a therapeutic target, even this indirect evidence encourages further studies on the potential involvement of Helicobacter pylori in CML aetiology.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628021>A single faecal microbiota transplantation modulates the microbiome and improves clinical manifestations in a rat model of colitis.</a></h2><p>Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a novel potential therapy for , but it is poorly characterised.We evaluated the performance of the mouse and rat as a pre-clinical model for human microbiota engraftment. We then characterised the effect of a single human stool transfer (HST) on a humanised model of DSS-induced colitis. Colonic and faecal microbial communities were analysed using the 16S rRNA approach and clinical manifestations were assessed in a longitudinal setting.The microbial community of rats showed greater similarity to that of humans, while the microbiome of mice showed less similarity to that of humans. Moreover, rats captured more human microbial species than mice after a single HST. Using the rat model, we showed that HST compensated faecal dysbiosis by restoring alpha-diversity and by increasing the relative abundance of health-related microbial genera. To some extent, HST also modulated the microbial composition of colonic tissue. These faecal and colonic microbial communities alterations led to a relative restoration of colon length, and a significant decrease in both epithelium damage and  severity. Remarkably, stopping inflammation by removing DSS before HST caused a faster and greater recovery of both microbiome and clinical manifestation features.Our results indicate that the rat outperforms the mouse as a model for human microbiota engraftment and show that the efficacy of HST can be enhanced when inflammation stimulation is withdrawn. Finally, our findings support a new therapeutic strategy based on the use FMT combined with anti- drugs.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS colitis model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic acid (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. All-trans retinoic acid altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic acid cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated colitis-associated weight loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and  conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating IBD-associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Herein, we identify AP-1 as the transcription factor that directs most of this remodeling. Chromatin accessibility profiling showed quick opening of closed chromatin in naive T cells within 5 h of activation. These newly opened regions were strongly enriched for the AP-1 motif, and indeed, ChIP-seq demonstrated AP-1 binding at >70% of them. Broad inhibition of AP-1 activity prevented chromatin opening at AP-1 sites and reduced the expression of nearby genes. Similarly, induction of anergy in the absence of co-stimulation during activation was associated with reduced induction of AP-1 and a failure of proper chromatin remodeling. The translational relevance of these findings was highlighted by the substantial overlap of AP-1-dependent elements with risk loci for multiple immune , including multiple sclerosis, , and allergic .

We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients (age 18-64) with UC in the United States to examine time trends for colectomy and biologic use from 2007 to 2016.We estimated quarterly rates for colectomy and biologic use using the IQVIA Legacy PharMetrics Adjudicated Claims Database. We used interrupted time series methods with segmented regression to assess time trends with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for biologic use and colectomy before and after the emergence of newly available biologic therapies in 2014.Among 93,930 patients with UC, 2275 (2.4%) underwent colectomy from 2007 to 2016. Biologic use rates increased significantly from 2007 to 2016, from 131 per 1000 person-years in 2007 (95% CI, 121 to 140) to 589 per 1000 person-years in 2016 (95% CI, 575 to 604; P < 0.001). Colectomy rates decreased significantly between 2007 and 2016, from 7.8 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 7.4 to 8.2) to 4.2 per 1000 person-years in 2016 (95% CI, 3.2 to 5.1; P < 0.001). An interruption in 2014 was associated with a positive trend deflection for biologic use (+72 treatments per 1000 person-years per year (95% CI, 61 to 83) and a negative trend deflection for colectomy (-0.76 per 1000 person-years per year; 95% CI, -1.47 to -0.05).Among commercially insured patients in the United States from 2007 to 2016, biologic use rates increased, colectomy rates decreased, and both trends were impacted by the interruption in 2014.

The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether EN in combination anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy is useful in maintaining remission. PubMed was used to identify all relevant studies. A total of nine articles were identified including one randomized control trial, two prospective cohort studies, and six retrospective cohort studies. We performed a meta-analysis on all these articles to assess the remission maintenance effect of EN (n = 857). The remission or response maintenance effect in the EN group was 203/288 (70.5%), which was higher than 306/569 (53.8%) in the non-EN group. The odds ratio for long-term remission or response using fixed effects model and random effects model were 2.23 (95% CI 1.60-3.10) and 2.19 (95% CI 1.49-3.22), respectively. The usefulness of EN was unclear in two prospective studies that were conducted immediately after remission induction with anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy was detected. Differences in the definition of relapse and the observation period among articles were considered to be limitations.

These cells are possible therapeutic agents for autoimmune disorders, since they present remarkable immunomodulatory ability.The increase of immune-mediated  in veterinary medicine has led to a growing interest in the research of these disorders and their medical treatment. Conventional immunomodulatory drug therapy such as glucocorticoids or other novel therapies such as cyclosporine or monoclonal antibodies are associated with numerous side effects that limit its long-term use, leading to the need for developing new therapeutic strategies that can be more effective and safe.The aim of this review is to provide a critical overview about the therapeutic potential of these cells in the treatment of some autoimmune disorders (canine atopic dermatitis, feline chronic gingivostomatitis,  and feline asthma) compared with their conventional treatment.Mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy in autoimmune  has been showing that this approach can ameliorate clinical signs or even cause remission in most animals, with the exception of canine atopic dermatitis in which little to no improvement was observed.Although mesenchymal stem cells present a promising future in the treatment of most of these disorders, the variability in the outcomes of some clinical trials has led to the current controversy among authors regarding their efficacy.

We aimed to describe the U.S. experience with vedolizumab in a commercially insured population.We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Quintiles-IMS Legacy PharMetrics Adjudicated Claims Database from May 2014 to June 2016. We included new vedolizumab users with Crohn  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) between 18 and 64 years with ≥12 months of continuous enrollment prior to initiating vedolizumab. Outcomes included treatment persistence >14 weeks, late steroid use, IBD-related surgery and infections associated with hospitalization. We built multivariable regression models to identify predictors of treatment persistence and late steroid use.We identified 269 CD and 187 UC vedolizumab initiators. Only 60% of CD patients and 56% of UC patients remained on vedolizumab after 14 weeks without IBD-related hospitalization, surgery, and corticosteroid use. There were no significant predictors of treatment persistence. Steroid use in the first 2 months of vedolizumab initiation was a significant predictor of late steroid use in CD (odds ratio: 23.34; 95% confidence interval: 5.10-153.89). In the 6 months after vedolizumab initiation, 1.9% of CD and 5.9% of UC patients had an IBD-related surgery. Serious infections were <4%.These data reflect the early U.S. experience with vedolizumab. The population-level response to vedolizumab therapy is just >50%. Steroids at the time of vedolizumab initiation is the strongest predictor of late steroid use in CD.

Parent-proxy report measures are standard for pediatric psychosocial assessment, and the IMPACT-III-P will provide a more comprehensive representation of HRQOL. Reliability and validity analyses were conducted.Parents (N = 50) of youth 8-17 years with IBD reported on their child's HRQOL (IMPACT-III-P and PedsQL-4.0) and depression (BASC-2); youth reported on their HRQOL (child IMPACT-III), pain interference (PROMIS Pain Interference), and  symptoms; and physicians completed measures of  activity.Criterion validity was established as the IMPACT-III-P was strongly, positively associated with the PedsQL (r = .59, p < .001). Convergent validity was supported as higher IMPACT-III-P scores were associated with less pain interference (r = -.41, p < .01) and lower depression (r = -.41, p < .01). Discriminant validity was partially supported, as higher IMPACT-III-P scores were associated with lower child-reported symptoms (r = -.41, p < .01), but scores did not differ based on inactive, mild, or moderate/severe  activity groups as rated by physicians. Internal consistency, parent-child agreement, and item-level analyses revealed strong reliability.The IMPACT-III-P demonstrated strong validity and reliability.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's  (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti- abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti- capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti- cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro- cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

The aim of this study was to compare the in-house ELISA (Promonitor IFX) with the much faster assay Quantum Blue® IFX (QB) for quantification of serum IFX concentration among IBD patients in maintenance IFX therapy.We studied 30 serum samples from outpatients in IFX maintenance therapy at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark. Samples were used to compare IFX measurements from Promonitor IFX with QB. Therapeutic intervals of <3 μg/mL, 3-7 μg/mL and >7 μg/mL were equally covered. Differences were evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and Student t-test. Correlation was evaluated using x,y-plot and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The intermediate imprecision (CV%) of QB was measured at two levels (3 μg/mL and 7 μg/mL). For qualitative comparison, weighted kappa statistics (κ) were determined after stratification of results by therapeutic interval.Promonitor IFX and QB were strongly correlated (r = 0.92, p<0.001). The mean difference between Promonitor IFX and QB was -0.57 μg/mL (p = 0.2). The CV% of QB was 16.3% at 3 μg/mL and 16.7% at 7 μg/mL. Classification of results according to therapeutic interval showed almost perfect agreement (κ = 0.81).QB is a suitable alternative to Promonitor IFX for TDM in patients treated with IFX for IBD. The results revealed a strong correlation between methods, in particular at lower IFX concentrations, representing the most interesting clinical range. When the samples were stratified according to the therapeutic interval, an almost perfect agreement between the methods was observed.Copyright © 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Impaired intestinal iron absorption due to  cytokines is thought to play a role in ACI. We undertook for the first time a controlled prospective study investigating effects of differing underlying ,  locations, and types of iron deficiency or anaemia on oral iron absorption in adult IBD patients with and without inflammation.This study was a comparative, single-centred open clinical trial in adults with IBD [n = 73] and healthy controls [n = 22]. Baseline parameters included blood count, iron status [ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, serum iron], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6. Iron absorption was tested using one oral, enteric-coated capsule containing 567.7 mg iron[II]-glycine-sulphate complex. Serum iron was determined 60/90/120/180/240 min after ingestion.Iron absorption capacity was shown to be influenced by inflammation and anaemia or iron deficiency [ID] type but not by underlying  type or localisation. The ACI group showed a significantly lower iron absorption capacity than all others. Whereas hsCRP levels [-0.387, p < 0.001], IL-6 [-0.331, p = 0.006], ferritin [-0.531, p < 0.001], and serum hepcidin [-0.353, p = 0.003] correlated negatively with serum iron change at 2 h, transferrin showed a positive correlation at the same time point [0.379, p < 0.001].Underlying  type and localisation appear to have little effect on iron absorption capacity, whereas lack of response to oral iron correlates well with serum markers of inflammation. Iron absorption capacity is thus significantly reduced in the presence of inflammation.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

It is suspected that the stigmatizing nature of IBD symptoms contributes to youths' health communication difficulties, leaving youth feeling disconnected from their social environment and potentially resulting in decreased social belongingness and poorer emotional functioning. In this study, we tested an illness stigma → health communication difficulties → thwarted belongingness → depressive symptoms serial mediation model. It was anticipated that youth illness stigma would confer a serial indirect effect on youth depressive symptoms through the sequential effects of stigma on health communication difficulties and thwarted social belongingness.Seventy-five youth with IBD between the ages of 10 and 18 completed measures of perceived illness stigma, health communication difficulties, thwarted belongingness, and depressive symptoms.Results indicated a significant illness stigma → thwarted belongingness → depressive symptoms simple mediation path. Importantly, findings also revealed a significant serial mediation path for illness stigma → health communication difficulties → thwarted belongingness → depressive symptoms.Youth who perceive greater IBD stigma appear to experience increased difficulty communicating about their IBD with others, which in turn is associated with feelings of thwarted social belongingness and ultimately elevated depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that difficulty communicating about IBD is one potential route by which illness stigma has a negative impact on youth adjustment outcomes. Results could also inform clinical interventions to address IBD stigma and health communication difficulties associated with the social and emotional challenges in youth with IBD.© The Author(s) 2019.

The search string consists of a combination of free text and MeSH terms with a common part on HADs and a -specific part. All identified papers will be screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. All articles that used/defined an algorithm for the identification of each  of interest using Italian HADs will be included.

Infectious uveitis occasionally shows symptoms similar to those of non-infectious uveitis. Therefore, distinguishing between non-infectious and infectious uveitis is critical for definitive diagnosis and appropriate choice of treatment. Once the cause of infection is known, treatment can be promptly initiated. However, in contrast to infectious uveitis, non-infectious uveitis is more difficult to diagnose clinically. Eliminating the possibility of infectious uveitis is important because unlike the infectious type, non-infectious uveitis is treated with immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids and biological agents. Compared to other countries, the drugs available in Japan are limited. Cyclosporin A is the only immunosuppressive drug available for treating uveitis in Japan, and infliximab and adalimumab are the only biological drugs that have been approved for use in the treatment of uveitis in Japan.

Clinical response and remission were assessed between 4 and 16 weeks after induction.Of a total of 163 patients, 97 were induced with ADA and 66 were induced with UST. Logistic regression model analysis adjusted based on effect size showed that ADA when compared to UST induced clinical response (73.2% vs. 50% (odds ratio (OR): 2.40; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14 - 5.07; P = 0.02)) and remission (44.3% vs. 27.7% (OR: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.07 - 5.16; P = 0.034) in a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients.

Of note, however, despite the small sample sizes of TNF-experienced patients who received ADA and TNF-naive patients who received UST, the higher effectiveness of ADA in inducing clinical response and indeed remission among patients with CD with active  appears to primarily be driven by those who are TNF-naive. Among TNF-experienced patients, UST may be superior in inducing clinical response and equally effective in inducing clinical remission when compared to ADA. Based on this study, one may infer that among TNF-experienced patients with CD with active , one could consider switching to an agent such as UST instead of a second approved TNF blocker. However, larger studies comparing the two agents are required.Copyright 2019, Ahmed et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640184>Gut DNA Virome Diversity and Its Association with Host Bacteria Regulate  Phenotype and Neuronal Immunotoxicity in Experimental Gulf War Illness.</a></h2><p>Gulf War illness (GWI) is characterized by the persistence of , chronic fatigue, neuroinflammation, headache, cognitive impairment, and other medically unexplained conditions. Results using a murine model show that enteric viral populations especially bacteriophages were altered in GWI. The increased viral richness and alpha diversity correlated positively with gut bacterial dysbiosis and proinflammatory cytokines. Altered virome signature in GWI mice also had a concomitant weakening of intestinal epithelial tight junctions with a significant increase in Claudin-2 protein expression and decrease in ZO1 and Occludin mRNA expression. The altered virome signature in GWI, decreased tight junction protein level was followed by the presence an activation of innate immune responses such as increased Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. The altered virome diversity had a positive correlation with serum IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ, intestinal inflammation (IFN-γ), and decreased Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a neurogenesis marker. The co-exposure of Gulf War chemical and antibiotic (for gut sterility) or Gulf War chemical and Ribavirin, an antiviral compound to suppress virus alteration in the gut showed significant improvement in epithelial tight junction protein, decreased intestinal-, systemic-, and neuroinflammation.

Intestinal microbiota residing in the GI tract engages in a mutualistic relationship with the host. Different sections of the GI tract contain distinct proportions of the intestinal microbiota, resulting in the presence of unique bacterial products in each GI section. The intestinal microbiota converts ingested nutrients into metabolites that target either the intestinal microbiota population or host cells. Metabolites act as messengers of information between the intestinal microbiota and host cells. The intestinal microbiota composition and resulting metabolites thus impact host development, health, and pathogenesis. Many recent studies have focused on modulation of the gut microbiota and their metabolites to improve host health and prevent or treat .

We aimed to investigate its effect on long-term drug retention and clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with Crohn's  (CD).The medical records of pediatric CD patients receiving anti-TNFα agents from 2007 to 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were stratified to those who initiated anti-TNFα treatment between 2007 and 2012, an era when TDM was not available (TDM-), and patients who initiated anti-TNFα treatment between 2013 and 2018, with at least 1 TDM during firstline anti-TNFα treatment (TDM+). The main outcome measures included time to first anti-TNFα discontinuation (drug retention), flares, and hospitalizations per year of first anti-TNFα treatment, treatment intensification rate, and surgical resection rate.One hundred ninety-seven patients were included (n = 98, TDM-; n = 99, TDM+; median [interquartile range] age, 12.6 [10.1-14.2] years; females 68 [35%]). Compared with the TDM- group, the TDM+ group had a longer drug retention time (mean ± SE, 45.0 ± 2.7 vs 33.5 ± 2.4 months; P = 0.001), lower hospitalization rate per patient per year (mean ± SE, 0.51 ± 0.7 vs 0.92 ± 0.81; P < 0.001), and higher treatment intensification rate (70% vs 18%; P < 0.001).

We aim to better understand the burden of 30-day readmissions among patients with IBD using a national hospital database.Retrospective cohort study of state-specific inpatient databases.The State Inpatient Databases for New York and Florida were used to identify patients with IBD hospitalized between 2009 and 2013. The prevalence of 30-day IBD-specific readmission was determined. The association between 30-day readmission and visit outcomes, specifically length of stay and a composite of comorbid conditions (venous thromboembolism, pneumonia, sepsis, Clostridium difficile infection, enteral and parenteral nutrition, and blood transfusion), was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.Patients with IBD accounted for 35,514 and 39,506 inpatient stays in New York and Florida, respectively. Of these stays, 13.7% to 16.2% resulted in a 30-day readmission. On multivariable analysis, 30-day readmissions were associated with a longer length of stay than index hospitalizations by 1.00 day (adjusted regression coefficient, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.73-1.26) and a higher likelihood of having a comorbid condition (adjusted odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.68-1.99) in New York.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for nonadherence.This was a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with IBD treated at a tertiary care center and prescribed self-injectable biologic therapy using the center's specialty pharmacy. Adherence was defined using medication possession ratio (MPR). Nonadherence was defined as MPR <0.86.Four hundred sixty patients (n = 393 with CD and n = 67 with UC) were evaluated with mean MPR (interquartile range) equaling 0.89 (0.48-1). Overall, 69% of patients were adherent (defined as MPR ≥0.86), 66% of patients with CD and 87% of patients with UC. In univariate analysis, several factors increased risk of nonadherence: CD diagnosis, insurance type, psychiatric history, smoking, prior biologic use, and narcotic use (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-15.6) and CD diagnosis (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0) increased risk of nonadherence. In CD, as the number of risk factors increased (narcotic use, psychiatric history, prior biologic use, and smoking), the probability of nonadherence increased. Adherence was 72% in patients with 0-1 risk factors, decreasing to 62%, 61%, and 42% in patients with 2, 3, and 4 risk factors, respectively (P < 0.05).This study identified risk factors for nonadherence to biologic therapy.

Currently, faecal calprotectin is a sensitive marker of gut inflammation however is not specific to Crohn's  (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) alone. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were shown to have potential in IBD diagnosis. : This systematic review aimed to examine the next-generation diagnosis of IBD in adults and children using VOCs. An in-depth literature-based search of current clinical studies of VOCs in the diagnosis of IBD was undertaken. Accuracy of IBD detection varied according to the technologies applied. Breath VOCs studies were pooled giving an overall sensitivity of 85% (95%CI: 79-89%) and specificity of 79% (95%CI 73-84%) whilst pooled faecal VOCs studies revealed a sensitivity of 87% (95%CI 77-93%) and specificity of 91% (95%CI 82-96%). Studies were limited by the variance of techniques applied in VOCs detection and the absence of well-designed longitudinal studies. : VOCs can be consistently and effectively detected in urine, breath, and stool in IBD patients. The sensitivity of breath VOCs in detecting IBD was comparable to faeces. However, optimal VOCs detection methodology and biological sampling still need to be standardised.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626561>Imaging Features of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: From Diagnosis to Liver Transplant Follow-up.</a></h2><p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic progressive   of the bile ducts that leads to multifocal bile duct fibrosis, strictures, cholestasis, liver parenchymal changes, and ultimately cirrhosis. It more commonly occurs in young adults, with a variety of clinical and imaging manifestations. The cause of the  is not known, but it has a strong association with  and can overlap with other autoimmune , including autoimmune hepatitis and immunoglobulin G4-related . Patients are predisposed to various hepatic and extrahepatic deteriorating complications, such as bile duct and gallbladder calculi, acute bacterial cholangitis, liver abscess, and portal hypertension, as well as malignancies including cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), gallbladder cancer, and colorectal carcinoma. Imaging has an essential role in diagnosis, surveillance, and detection of complications. MR cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography have high specificity and sensitivity for detection of primary  and assessment of  progression. However, many patients with PSC are still diagnosed incidentally at US or CT. Novel imaging techniques such as transient elastography and MR elastography are used to survey the grade of liver fibrosis. Annual cancer surveillance is necessary in all PSC patients to screen for CCA and gallbladder cancer. Familiarity with PSC pathogenesis and imaging features across various classic imaging modalities and novel imaging techniques can aid in correct imaging diagnosis and guide appropriate management. The imaging features of the biliary system and liver parenchyma in PSC across various imaging modalities are reviewed. Imaging characteristics of the differential diagnosis of PSC, clinical associations, and complications are described. Finally, the role of imaging in evaluation of PSC progression, pre-liver transplant assessment, and post-liver transplant  recurrence are discussed.RSNA, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645987>Gastrointestinal lymphoma: the new mimic.</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal (GI) lymphomas comprise a group of distinct clinicopathological entities of B- or T- cell type, with primary gastrointestinal Hodgkin lymphoma being extremely uncommon.

Several chronic  and immune-mediated disorders which predispose to accelerated cell turnover may lead to the malignant transformation of gut lymphocytes and ultimately manifest as GI lymphoma. The challenge for the clinical gastroenterologist is that these tumors may have varied presentations, ranging from nonspecific symptoms such as dyspepsia or bloating to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, GI bleeding, diarrhea, weight loss or  obstruction.We illustrate the range of presentations of GI lymphoma with examples based on consecutive cases evaluated at our institution over a 6-month period. These cases demonstrate how appropriately directed endoscopic evaluation with biopsies has the potential to provide a definitive diagnosis and allow the patient to proceed to definitive therapy.The GI tract is the most commonly involved site for extranodal lymphoma with the stomach being most frequently involved organ.

Descriptive summary statistics was used.In North America, about one-quarter of gastroenterology and radiology participants reported using  US for IBD; over 3-fourths expressed an interest in using US more often.  US was performed more frequently for Crohn's . Both groups agreed the main limitation to using  US was concern for inter-observer variability and operator-dependent factors; radiologists reported that other modalities are more effective to assess IBD, whereas gastroenterologists reported unfamiliarity with  US indications and techniques.Our data show there is significant interest among both radiologists and gastroenterologists in using  US.

The aim of this study is to clarify whether the measurement of FC has changed the number of ultrasound and endoscopic procedures, drug modifications, as well as FC re-measurements in IBD patients.This retrospective study included 242 IBD patients with available FC values (case cohort) and 46 patients without an available FC value (control cohort). Clinical consequences such as carrying out abdominal ultrasound, endoscopy, drug modification or FC re-measurement at the next ambulatory presentation or during in-patient stay were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the association between clinical decision-making and patient's characteristics, especially FC value.Overall, 192 (67%) clinical consequences were noted in both cohorts. In the case cohort 174 (91%) implications were noted compared to 18 (9%) in the control cohort (P < 0.001). In the case cohort, significantly more clinical consequences were detected in patients with Crohn's  (CD) as well as in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with a FC value > 250 mg/Kg than in patients with a value of ≤ 250 mg/Kg. In CD patients with high FC values significantly increased numbers of abdominal ultrasounds, endoscopies and FC re-measurements were noted. In UC patients with high FC values significantly increased numbers of abdominal ultrasounds, drug modifications and FC re-measurements were noted.Measurement of FC may alter physician's clinical decision-making in IBD patients beside other clinical and diagnostic parameters.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's  (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed -specific displacement advantages under two- status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

The sulfonamides were the first effective antibiotics to be introduced into clinical medicine and have been in use continuously since the 1930’s. They are considered bacteriostatic and appear to act by inhibition of bacterial biosynthesis of folic acid, which is needed for cell growth, at least in those bacteria that are sensitive to sulfonamides. Because humans rely upon dietary folic acid, they are usually resistant to the adverse effects of inhibition of folate synthesis. Sulfonamides have a wide range of antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and -negative organisms. Unfortunately, bacterial resistance to sulfonamides is now common, and their use has decreased with the introduction of more potent classes of antibiotics. However, sulfonamides are still widely used especially for urinary tract infections in combination with trimethoprim and for treatment or prevention of parasitic (toxoplasmosis, pneumocystosis jiroveci) and malarial infections usually combined with trimethoprim or pyrimethamine. Sulfonamides with 5-aminosalicyclic acid are the structural components of sulfasalazine, which is widely used for long term management of . The combination of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine is used as prophylaxis against chloroquine-resistant malaria. Dapsone is a sulfonamide related drug that is used for the therapy of leprosy and dermatitits herpetiformis. The sulfonamides are well known to cause idiosyncratic liver injury. Hepatotoxicity appears to be a class effect, in that virtually all sulfonamides used today have been linked to rare, but convincing cases of drug induced liver injury. The pattern of injury is variable, often mixed but it can be either hepatocellular or cholestatic. Most typically, the injury appears precipitously within one to three weeks of starting therapy, often preceded or accompanied by signs of hypersensitivity such as fever, rash, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and eosinophilia or atypical lymphocytosis (or both). Hepatotoxicity from sulfonamides may represent a part of a spectrum of hypersensitivity due to sulfa-derived medications and have been linked to many cases of DRESS (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) as well as Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrosis. The severity of injury varies widely. Most instances of sulfonamide related liver injury are mild-to-moderate in severity and self-limited in course. Cases with severe cholestasis may be prolonged and can lead to vanishing bile duct syndrome. Importantly, sulfonamides can cause acute liver failure, particularly in instances with a precipitious onset and hepatocellular pattern of serum enzyme elevations. Indeed, the sulfonamides remain one of the most common causes of drug induced acute liver failure and account for 5% to 10% of instances in many case series. Formulations of sulfonamides currently in general use in the United States include sulfadiazine, sulfadoxine, and sulfisoxazole as well as the combination formulations including sulfasalazine and trimethoprim-sulfamethazole (TMP-SMZ, also referred to as co-trimoxazole). The term sulfonamide applies to derivatives of para-aminobenzene sulfonamide (sulfanilamide), which is composed of a benzene ring with a sulfate and amide group at one end and an amide group at the other (para-position). These agents will be discussed as groups, rather than individual medications, and cases and references are combined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644050>Vedolizumab.</a></h2><p>Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to integrin α4β7 which is used in the treatment of .

Alogliptin is efficacious both as monotherapy and as add-on/combination therapy with other commonly prescribed T2DM treatments, such as metformin and pioglitazone. Overall, alogliptin is well-tolerated in patients with T2DM, including older patients, those with renal and/or hepatic impairment, and those at high risk of cardiovascular events. There is a low risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, acute pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal adverse events with alogliptin treatment, as demonstrated in long-term trials (lasting up to 4.5 years) and in a real-world setting. Additionally, alogliptin has a generally favorable or similar safety profile in comparison to other antidiabetic agents (metformin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, α-glucosidase inhibitors, and insulin). However, further evaluation would be required to determine the mechanism and effect of alogliptin on heart failure, bullous pemphigoid, and . Of note, due to the ethnic diversity in the epidemiology of T2DM, alogliptin has been shown to be more efficacious in Asian patients than in non-Asian patients with T2DM, but with a similar tolerability profile. These data indicate that DPP-4is, including alogliptin, are important treatment options, especially for Asian patients with T2DM, for whom they have potential as a first-line therapy. This benefit-risk assessment aims to place alogliptin within the current armamentarium of T2DM and aid physicians when choosing optimal diabetes treatment for their patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665288>Safety of Combination Biologic and Antirejection Therapy Post-Liver Transplantation in Patients With .</a></h2><p>Patients with  (IBD) post-liver transplant (LT) may have  inflammation requiring biologic therapy.

Safety outcomes were extracted by medical chart review. For an updated literature review, EMBASE, Medline, and CENTRAL were searched to identify studies evaluating the safety of combination biologic and antirejection therapy in IBD patients.In the case series, 19 patients were identified. Most underwent LT for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC; 14/19, 74%) treated with anti-integrins (8/19, 42%) or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) antagonists (6/19, 32%). Infections occurred in 11/19 (58%) patients, most commonly Clostridium difficile (4/19, 21%). Two patients required colectomy, and 1 patient required re-transplantation. In the literature review, 13 case series and 8 case reports reporting outcomes for 122 IBD patients treated with biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT were included. PSC was the indication for LT in 97/122 (80%) patients, and 91/122 (75%) patients were treated with TNF antagonists. Infections occurred in 32/122 (26%) patients, primarily Clostridium difficile (7/122, 6%). patients receiving combination biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT appeared to be at increased risk of Clostridium difficile. Compared with the general liver transplant population in the published literature, there was no increased risk of serious infection.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

In healthy individuals, gut commensal fungi act synergistically with other members of the microbiota to maintain homeostasis but their role in IBD is less clear.To review the role of gut fungi and their trans-kingdom interactions with bacteria in IBD METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Ovid and Pubmed to select relevant animal and human studies that have reported fungi and IBD.There is an increased total fungal load particularly of Candida and Malassezia species in the faeces and mucosa of Crohn's  patients, and a lower fungal diversity in the faeces of ulcerative colitis patients. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein (CARD)-9 polymorphism in Crohn's  patients favours Malassezia colonisation that worsens gut inflammation. Diet high in carbohydrates increased the total abundance of Candida species, whereas protein-rich diet had the opposite effect. Anti-fungal therapies are mostly used to treat Candida albicans or Histoplasma capsulatum infections in IBD, whereas pilot studies of supplementing fungal probiotics Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Saccharomyces boulardii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 strain showed therapeutic effects in IBD.Gut fungi are altered in patients with Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis.

Patient assessment included full clinical examination, validated scores, anorectal manometry, three-dimensional endoanal ultrasonography, and endoscopy. The  Questionnaire was adopted to evaluate patients' quality of life.  From January to November 2016, 37 consecutive IBD patients (30 Crohn's , 7 ulcerative colitis) and 20 controls were enrolled in the study. Twenty-five patients had a history of perianal fistula, 9 reported fecal incontinence, and 2 had anal fissure. Fecal incontinent patients were older, had a longer  duration, and higher  movement number than continent patients. Endoanal ultrasound findings were normal in all volunteers, while pathological features were found in 31/37 patients. Rectal sensory testing and anal pressure did not differ between the IBD patients and controls. However, the rectoanal inhibitory reflex was normally elicited in all controls vs. 32/37 (86%) IBD patients; 25/37 (68%) IBD patients showed manometric features of dyssynergic defecation.

Almost 9 million persons are diagnosed with TB each year and around 2 million deaths are due to TB or TB complications. Abdominal TB has no specific clinical symptoms, no imagistic and no specific laboratory tests, all these making the diagnosis more difficult. Most often, clinical, radiographic, and histopathological (HP) aspects in TB enteritis are nonspecific and may suggest cancer or . We present the case of a 42-year-old male patient, with intestinal and lung TB presenting as intestinal obstruction to emphasize the importance of clinical suspicion and histopathology for final diagnosis. Chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) evidenced a few left-sided pulmonary nodules and wall thickening of some parts of the small and large . Also, CT evidenced nearby mesenteric lymphadenopathy. He was admitted in the Department of Surgery and later confirmed with intestinal TB. Because of modified chest radiography, further investigations identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum. Final diagnosis was concomitant lung and intestinal TB confirmed by sputum and histopathology. The patient received proper anti-tuberculous treatment and his condition improved after the first month.

CD4CD8αα IELs are one of the most important types of IELs, and they play an irreplaceable role in maintaining the balance of the intestinal immune system. CD4CD8αα IELs are often regarded as a special subtype of CD4 IELs that can express CD8αα on their cytomembrane. Hence, CD4CD8αα IELs not only have the ability to modulate the functions of immune cells but also are regarded as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Transcription factors, microbes, and dietary factors have a substantial effect on the development of CD4CD8αα IELs, which make them exert immunosuppression and cytotoxicity activities. In addition, there is an intimate relationship between CD4CD8αα IELs and  (IBD), whereas it is still unclear how CD4CD8αα IELs influence IBD. As such, this review will focus on the unparalleled differentiation of CD4CD8αα IELs and discuss how these cells might be devoted to tolerance and immunopathological responses in the intestinal tract. In addition, the role of CD4CD8αα IELs in IBD would also be discussed.Copyright © 2019 Zhou, Qiu and Yang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641205>DSS-induced colitis produces inflammation-induced bone loss while irisin treatment mitigates the  state in both gut and bone.</a></h2><p>Chronic pediatric  (IBD) leads to lack of bone accrual, bone loss, and increased fractures. Presently there is no cure, and many IBD treatments incur negative side effects. We previously discovered treatment with exogenous irisin resolved  changes in the colon, gut lymphatics, and bone in a mild IBD rodent model. Here we assess irisin treatment in severe IBD induced via dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Male Sprague Dawley rats (2-mo-old) were untreated (Con) or given 2% DSS in drinking water. In week two, half of each group (Con + Ir and DSS + Ir) received injections of recombinant irisin (i.p., 2x/wk). After 4 weeks, gut inflammation was associated with declines in bone mineral density and cancellous bone volume. Furthermore, elevated osteocyte TNF-α, interleukin-6, RANKL, OPG, and sclerostin corresponded with higher osteoclast surfaces and lower bone formation rate in DSS animals as well as lower ultimate load. While irisin treatment improved colon inflammation, there were no improvements in bone density or bone mechanical properties; however, irisin elevated bone formation rate, decreased osteoclast surfaces, and reduced osteocyte pro- factors. These data highlight the negative impact of chronic gut inflammation on bone as well as the therapeutic potential of irisin as an anti- treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642533>Idiopathic chronic diarrhea associated with dysbiosis in a captive cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis).</a></h2><p>Chronic  enteric  occur commonly in humans and animals, especially in captive bred macaques.

This study aimed to review the current knowledge regarding the efficacy of dietary and nutritional intervention in IBD patients. Exclusive enteral nutrition might be inferior to corticosteroid treatment in adults with active Crohn's  (CD) but might even be superior considering the adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment in children. Total parenteral nutrition has no advantage over enteral nutrition, which is considered a more physiologic modality in organ function. Current guidelines do not yet recommend ω3-polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for the prevention and maintenance of remission in IBD patients. Dietary fiber supplementation could be effective in the relief of symptoms and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (UC). Although vitamin D may be favorable to clinical course of IBD and bone density. Probiotic supplementation has proven to be effective in preventing and treating pouchitis for UC but is less effective in treating CD. Nutritional interventions not only correct nutritional deficiencies but also improve symptoms and clinical courses of the . Hence, nutritional approaches need to be developed to significantly evaluate the effectiveness of dietary interventions used to treat IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646033>Transdermal fluorescence detection of a dual fluorophore system for noninvasive point-of-care gastrointestinal permeability measurement.</a></h2><p>The intestinal mucosal barrier prevents macromolecules and pathogens from entering the circulatory stream.

Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is one of the widespread anthocyanins in plants, and cyanidin (Cy) is the aglycone of C3G that can be generated in intestine under gut microorganism metabolism. To explore the anti- activity of single anthocyanins compound and show the potential mechanism, the protective effects of C3G and its aglycone Cy on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco-2 cellular monolayer inflammation were studied. The results showed that both C3G and Cy significantly improved the clinical symptoms and relieved the histological damage in TNBS-challenged mice. The activity of myeloperoxidase and the excretion of  cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interferon- were also significantly inhibited at the administration dosage of 200 mol/kg.  studies showed that when LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were pretreated with C3G and Cy, the destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier was ameliorated due to the improvement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux values, while there were no significant difference between C3G and Cy groups at the same dosage. Similarly, both C3G and Cy suppressed nitric oxide production and  cytokines secretion of LPS-induced Caco-2 cells. C3G and its aglycone Cy had similar anti- activity in both colitis mice and Caco-2 cells. The results suggest that C3G and Cy may exert anti- effects by protecting the intestinal barrier as well as by suppressing  cytokine secretion.

Cumulative probability of perianal CD relapse was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.After a median follow-up of 89 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 65-173 months), 44 of the 78 perianal CD patients (56.4%) relapsed after stopping anti-TNF, defined as increased fistula drainage or recurrence of previously healed fistula, after stopping anti-TNF therapy. Cumulative probabilities of perianal CD relapse were 50.8%, 72.6% and 78.0% at 12, 36 and 60 months, respectively. Younger age at diagnosis of CD [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.09; P = .04] was associated with a higher chance of perianal CD relapse. Among those with perianal CD relapse (n = 44), retreatment with anti-TNF induced remission in 24 of 29 patients (82.8%). Twelve (27.3%) patients required defunctioning surgery and one (2.3%) required proctectomy. Maintenance with thiopurine was not associated with a reduced likelihood of relapse [HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.58-2.12; P = .77]. Among the 17 patients who achieved radiological remission of perianal CD, five (35.3%) developed relapse after stopping anti-TNF therapy after a median of 6 months.More than half of the perianal CD patients developed relapse after stopping anti-TNF therapy. Most regained response after resuming anti-TNF. However, more than one-fourth of the perianal CD patients with relapse required defunctioning surgery. Radiological assessment before stopping anti-TNF is crucial in perianal CD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635181>Geographic Distribution, Phenotype and Epidemiological Tendency in  Patients in Romania.</a></h2><p> The incidence of  (IBD) over the past years in Romania has been on the rise, but epidemiologic data are lacking. The aim of this study was to define the characteristics of IBD, the trends and phenotype among IBD patients in Romania.  We conducted a prospective study over a period of 12 years, from 2006 to 2017. All patients diagnosed with IBD on clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological features were included. We divided the country into eight regions: west (W), north-east (NE), north-west (NW), south-east (SE), south-west (SW), south (S), central (C) and Bucharest-Ilfov (B), and data were analyzed accordingly.  A total of 2724 patients were included in this database, but only 2248 were included in the final analysis, with all data available. Of the 2248 patients, 935 were Crohn's  (CD), 1263 were ulcerative colitis (UC) and 50 were IBD-undetermined. In UC phenotypes we observed more frequent left-sided colitis (50.5%,  < 0.0001), and in CD phenotype we observed more frequent colonic and ileo-colonic localization (37.8% and 37.6%,  < 0.0001). The region with the most IBD cases was NE (25.1%) and with the least IBD cases was SW (4.9%). UC was found more frequently in NE (32%), while CD was found more frequently in Bucharest (28.6%).  In Romania, ulcerative colitis is more frequent than CD. UC is predominant in the northern part of Romania, while CD has become predominant in the southern part of the country. IBD occurs more in the male population, and in urban and industrialized areas.

Using smartphones to communicate symptoms and biomarkers is a potential alternative. We aimed to compare outpatient management using 2 smartphone apps (IBDsmart for symptoms and IBDoc for fecal calprotectin monitoring) vs standard face-to-face care. We hypothesized noninferiority of quality of life and symptoms at 12 months plus a reduction in face-to-face appointments in the smartphone app group. outpatients (previously seen more often than annually) were randomized to smartphone app or standard face-to-face care over 12 months. Quality of life and symptoms were measured quarterly for 12 months. Acceptability was measured for gastroenterologists and patients at 12 months.One hundred people (73 Crohn's , 49 male, average age 35 years) consented and completed baseline questionnaires (50 in each group). Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses revealed noninferiority of quality of life and symptom scores at 12 months. Outpatient appointment numbers were reduced in smartphone app care (P < 0.001). There was no difference in number of surgical outpatient appointments or number of -related hospitalizations between groups. Adherence to IBDsmart (50% perfect adherence) was slightly better than adherence to IBDoc (30% perfect adherence). Good acceptability was reported among most gastroenterologists and patients.Remote symptom and fecal calprotectin monitoring is effective and acceptable. It also reduces the need for face-to-face outpatient appointments. Patients with mild-to-moderate  who are not new diagnoses are ideal for this system.ACTRN12615000342516.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

In our study, rats were induced with complete freund's adjuvant (CFA) to be animal models for studying the RA pathogenesis. Microtubule-associated Serine/Threonine-protein kinase 3 (MAST3) has been documented to play a critical role in regulating the immune response of IBD () and involved in the process of cytoskeleton organization, intracellular signal transduction and peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, but its role in the progression of RA remains unknown and is warranted for investigation. So, we tried our best to investigate the mechanism and signaling pathway of MAST3 in RA progression. In the synovial tissue and FLSs of AA rats, we have found that MAST3 was significantly up-regulated than normal. Furthermore, MAST3 overexpression could promote proliferation and  response of FLSs. In the aspect of mechanism, we discovered that the expression of MAST3 might involve in NF-κB signaling pathway in RA. On the whole, our results suggested that MAST3 might promote the proliferation and inflammation of FLSs by regulating NF-κB signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the aetiology and management of chronic pain is a poorly understood area of IBD research. This qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of individuals with IBD and pain, the pain management strategies they use and any needs for future pain management interventions.In all, 14 individuals with IBD were purposively recruited and interviewed (face-to-face or telephone) using a topic guide. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using inductive thematic analysis.Themes identified were 'vicious cycles', 'findings solutions' and 'attitudes'. The experience and impact of pain were rarely viewed in isolation, but rather within the context of a cycle of IBD symptoms. Other 'vicious cycles' identified included anxiety, avoidance and inactivity, and poor understanding and communication. Pain management included short- and long-term strategies. Searching for a solution for pain had an emotional impact on individuals. There were contrasting attitudes from participants, including defeat, tolerance and acceptance.This study provides an understanding of the experience of pain in IBD. The interaction of pain with accompanying IBD symptoms has an emotional and physical impact on individuals, and creates a barrier to adequate assessment, understanding and treatment of pain. Patients rely on their own experiences, and a trial and error approach to apply helpful strategies.

This research points to the daily challenges that patients experience which can relate to their physical and psychological health, as well as their social wellbeing, and may impact negatively on their lives. To date, there has been little attempt to synthesise these studies, and little is known about how patients manage the challenges they experience.A meta-synthesis was conducted, based on guidelines developed by Sandelowski and Barroso (2007) and PRISMA (Moher et al. 2009).Searches were conducted within the CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection and SocINDEX databases to locate qualitative and mixed methodology studies. The retrieved articles were screened against pre-determined inclusion criteria. Quality appraisal was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for qualitative research (Lockwood et al. 2015).Thematic analysis resulted in three themes: the unpredictability of living with IBD, the emotional turmoil of living with IBD and striving to maintain a normal life in managing IBD.The greatest challenges for patients identified in this meta-synthesis were the physical symptoms associated with IBD. These impacted negatively on their psychological and social wellbeing and reduced their quality of life. There is a notable gap in research on patient experiences of managing the challenges identified in everyday life and to what extent they receive support from healthcare professionals.The results of this meta-synthesis offer insights into how the physical challenges of living with IBD, particularly in relation to symptoms, impact adversely on patients' psychological and social wellbeing. These insights are clinically relevant to healthcare professionals as a basis for supporting patients to manage their challenges.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626699>Is Ulcerative Colitis Associated With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis an Undertreated Condition?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646151>Implementing a Novel Quality Improvement-Based Approach to Data Quality Monitoring and Enhancement in a Multipurpose Clinical Registry.</a></h2><p>To implement a quality improvement based system to measure and improve data quality in an observational clinical registry to support a Learning Healthcare System.ImproveCareNow Network registry, which as of September 2019 contained data from 314,250 visits of 43,305 pediatric  (IBD) patients at 109 participating care centers.The impact of data quality improvement support to care centers was evaluated using statistical process control methodology.

Surgical best practices have been largely based on single-institution results and meta-analyses, with multicenter clinical data lacking. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) has revolutionized the way in which large-volume surgical outcomes data have been collected. Our aim was to employ the ACS-NSQIP to collect -specific variables relevant to surgical outcomes in IBD.A collaborative of 13 high-volume IBD surgery centers was convened to collect 5 IBD-specific variables in NSQIP. Variables included biologic and immunomodulator medications usage, ileostomy utilization, ileal pouch anastomotic technique, and colonic dysplasia/neoplasia. A sample of the Surgical Clinical Reviewer collected data was validated by a colorectal surgeon at each institution, and kappa's agreement statistics generated.Over 1 year, data were collected on a total of 956 cases. Overall, 41.4% of patients had taken a biologic agent in the 60 days before surgery. The 2 most commonly performed procedures were laparoscopic ileocolic resections (159 cases) and subtotal colectomies (151 cases). Overall, 56.8% of cases employed an ileostomy, and 134 ileal pouches were constructed, of which 92.4% used stapled technique. A sample of 214 (22.4%) consecutive cases was validated from 8 institutions. All 5 novel variables were shown to be reliably collected, with excellent agreement for 4 variables (kappa ≥ 0.70) and very good agreement for the presence of colonic dysplasia (kappa = 0.68).We report the results of the initial year of implementation of the first -specific collaborative within NSQIP.

We investigated the role of LINC01234 in CRC development and confirmed its correlation with Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), a tumor suppressor gene that is dysregulated in CRC.We tested mRNA levels using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Tissue samples from patients with CRC,  (IBD), hyperplastic polyp, and adenoma were included. Correlations between clinicopathological parameters, overall survival (OS) rate, and LINC01234 were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis H test. Additionally, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumor formation in nude mice were tested to investigate the mechanism of LINC01234. Western blotting was used to determine protein levels.LINC01234 expression was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues and CRC cell lines than in non-tumor tissues and normal epithelial cells, respectively. LINC01234 was associated with high tumor stage, larger tumor size, and metastasis. Patients with higher LINC01234 expression showed reduced OS. Cell proliferation was inhibited by LINC01234 knockdown, whereas apoptosis was enhanced. Mice injected with SW480 cells with LINC01234 knockdown displayed decreased tumor volume, weight, and Ki-67 levels compared with those injected with control cells. KLF6 was negatively regulated by LINC01234. Overexpression of KLF6 showed effects similar to those observed following LINC01234 knockdown on cell proliferation and apoptosis.LINC01234 could be a prognostic biomarker in CRC patients. Upregulation of LINC01234 in CRC promotes tumor development through negative regulation of KLF6.© The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626698>Bariatric Surgery and Its Complications in  Patients.</a></h2><p>Recent data have suggested that bariatric procedures, especially laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG), are safe and effective weight loss measures in patients with  (IBD). But most of the studies have looked at short-term outcomes, and there is a general lack of awareness of underlying  processes and baseline comorbidities in IBD patients undergoing bariatric procedures. Postbariatric issues in IBD patients including diarrhea from dumping syndrome, choleretic diarrhea, a high prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, gastroesophageal reflux , Barrett's esophagus, stomal ulcerations, stenosis, and renal and gallstones can complicate the natural history of IBD. This could lead to unnecessary hospitalizations, change of medical therapy, and poor surgical and quality of life outcomes. In this review, we will discuss major complications after common bariatric procedures (SG, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and gastric banding) and suggest possible management strategies.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

We assessed correlation between Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's  (SES-CD) and individual CDAI items stratified by  location to better understand this relationship.We pooled patient-level data from 3 placebo-controlled Crohn's  (CD) trials that tested adalimumab, upadacitinib, and risankizumab.  location was defined as ileum only, colon only, or ileocolonic based upon colonoscopy at study entry. Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression assessed correlations between items of the CDAI and SES-CD.A total of 353 patients were included (20.7% ileal, 30.6% colonic, 48.7% ileocolonic ). Crohn's  Activity Index and SES-CD scores were moderately correlated (R = 0.33; P < 0.001). Among CDAI items, the strongest correlations with SES-CD were seen with very soft or liquid stool frequency (SF) and patient-reported outcome 2 (PRO2; which includes SF and abdominal pain score; both R = 0.36; P < 0.001); these correlations were numerically stronger in colonic  (SF: R = 0.46; P < 0.001; PRO2: R = 0.44; P < 0.001) than in ileal  (SF: R = 0.14; P = 0.23; PRO2: R = 0.21; P = 0.07), although a test for interaction was not significant. In adjusted linear regression models, the proportion of mucosa that was inflamed and the proportion of mucosa with ulceration were positively correlated, whereas the presence of strictures was inversely correlated with SF.The SF item of the CDAI is moderately correlated with SES-CD and independently correlated with mucosal ulceration, inflammation, and strictures. Understanding why  inflammation as measured endoscopically does not correlate more strongly with patients' symptoms could help develop scales that link CD pathology to patient experience.Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

However, significant challenges still exist in Latin America to facilitate the access of biological agents for physicians and patients.The aim of this review was to summarize current evidence on penetration of biological agents for CD and UC in Latin America.Data are derived from a previous complete systematic review that explored different characteristics of  (IBD) in Latin America. The studies fully included in this previous systematic review which contained detailed descriptions of the percentage of use of biological agents in different cohorts throughout Latin American and Caribbean countries were included, and descriptive findings were compiled, describing CD and UC penetration of these drugs in different patient cohorts from different countries.From the 61 studies included in the original systematic review, only 19 included data of the percentage of patients treated with biological agents. Anti-TNF use in CD varied from 1.51% in Mexico up to 46.9% in Colombia, with most of the studies describing anti-TNF use in approximately 20%-40% of CD patients. On the other side, the frequency of the use of biologics was clearly lower in UC, varying from 0% in 2009 to up 16.2% in 2018, according to two different Mexican studies. Only two studies described the penetration of anti-TNF agents in IBD overall: 13.4% in a Colombian and 37.93% in a Brazilian study. No studies described percentage of use of new biologic agents (vedolizumab and ustekinumab).Penetration of anti-TNF agents in Latin America is comparable to the rest of the world in CD, but lower in UC. With the increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD, specific strategies to increase access to anti-TNF agents in UC and new biological agents overall are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648810>Limitations of the determination of faecal calprotectin in patients with ulcerative colitis and  polyps.</a></h2><p>Faecal calprotectin is a useful technique for detecting activity in patients with ulcerative colitis. However, there may be high levels due to factors other than the activity of ulcerative colitis. Our aim was to analyse possible false positive results of calprotectin for the activity of ulcerative colitis owing to the presence of  polyps.Retrospective, observational, descriptive study. Data was collected from patients monitored for 2 years in whom a colonoscopy had been requested within 3 months after detecting high calprotectin values (>150μg/g) and before modifying the treatment.We reviewed 39 patients and in 5 of them, with previous diagnosis of extensive ulcerative colitis,  polyps were detected. Three patients were on treatment with mesalazine, one with azathioprine and other with infliximab. All of them were asymptomatic and the endoscopy did not show macroscopic activity (endoscopic Mayo score=0) or histological activity. The median values of calprotectin were 422μg/g (IQR: 298-2,408) and they remained elevated in a second measurement. In 4 of the patients the  polyps were multiple and small in size. The other patient had a polyp measuring 4cm.In clinical practice we can find high faecal calprotectin levels not due to the presence of ulcerative colitis activity, but due to other lesions such as  polyps. This fact must be taken into account before carrying out relevant changes such as step-up therapy to immunosuppressive drugs or biological drugs in patients with confirmed high calprotectin levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

They share similar symptoms but differ in the location and extent of inflammation and in complications. We identified 249 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CD and 38 in UC at a false discovery rate of 1%. 20 of the DEGs were common to both . A multivariate test identified 260 DEGs associated with IBD, 53 of which were not found in any of the disorders. We identified important molecular pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD, such as the JAK/STAT and interferon-gamma signaling pathways, genes involved in cell adhesion, apoptosis and carcinogenesis. Among others, BCAT1 and GZMB are interesting novel DEGs that deserve further investigation in experimental models. The method could also be useful to other cases of meta-analysis of gene expression data.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means of further “humanizing” them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies indicate whether they are mouse (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically mediated  such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, , multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, among others. In addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis and viral or bacterial infections. Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2018, more than 60 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are approved and in use in the United States. Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino acids that can used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an immune mediate hepatic injury. Finally, monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune system may cause reactivation of latent infections, including tuberculosis and hepatitis B.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631055>Skeletal status assessed by quantitative ultrasound and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in children with : A 2-year prospective study.</a></h2><p>To assess the bone status in children with  (IBD) using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measurement and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and after two years of adequate treatment of the IBD and bone protection medication.Sixteen children (six boys) with IBD, aged 13.4±2.4 years, were examined at baseline and two years later.

QUS measurements were performed in patients and controls - 48 healthy children.Mean Z-scores for TB- and s-BMD were significantly below zero for both, baseline and follow-up (-2.61±0.99 and -2.48±0.88 for TB, and -1.83±1.33 and -1.61±1.19 for s-BMD, respectively), and did not differ significantly, as well as mean Ad-SoS Z-score. The changes in time of TB Z-score and body weight Z-score correlated positively (r=0.63; P<0.01). The QUS results did not differ between patients and controls. There was a negative correlation between the baseline nutritional status and the activity of the , as well as of the number of flares before the enrolment and Ad-SoS Z-score.BMD was found to be lowered both at baseline and follow-up. No further deterioration was observed during 2-year follow-up. Proper treatment, defined as treatment following ECCO Guidelines, may allow to keep a similar trend in the development of bone tissue as in healthy children. The bone properties assessed by QUS method did not differ between patients and controls.

It is a reversible and inheritable mechanism that could offer treatment targets. We aimed to assess the methylation changes on specific genes previously associated with Crohn's  (CD) and to study their possible associations with the pathology.We included 103 participants and grouped them into 2 cohorts (a first [n = 31] and a second validation [n = 72] cohort), with active CD (aCD) and inactive CD (iCD) and healthy participants (CTR). DNA was obtained from the peripheral blood and analyzed by the Agena platform. The selected genes were catalase (CAT), α-defensin 5 (DEFA5), FasR, FasL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF1B, PPA2, ABCB1, NOD2, PPARγ, and PKCζ. We used the elastic net algorithm and R software.We studied 240 CpGs. Sixteen CpGs showed differential methylation profiles among aCD, iCD, and CTR. We selected for validation those with the greatest differences: DEFA5 CpG_11; CpG_13; CAT CpG_31.32; TNF CpG_4, CpG_12; and ABCB1 CpG_21. Our results validated the genes DEFA5 (methylation gain) and TNF (methylation loss) with P values < 0.001. In both cases, the methylation level was maintained and did not change with CD activity (aCD vs iCD). The subanalysis comparison between aCD and iCD showed significant differential methylation profiles in other CpGs: TNF, FAS, ABCB1, CAT, and TNFRS1BF genes.The methylation status of DEFA5 and TNF genes provides a signature biomarker that characterizes patients with CD and supports the possible implication of the environment and the immune system in CD pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627144>Does symptom activity explain psychological differences in patients with irritable  syndrome and ? Results from a multi-center cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Irritable  syndrome (IBS) and  (IBD) have similar symptoms and are affected by psychological factors via gut-brain-interactions. However, previous studies on IBS and IBD showed inconsistent results regarding psychological factors, potentially because they failed to consider the impact of symptom activity. The aim of this study was 1) to compare psychological distress and psychological risk factors among patients with IBS, IBD and healthy controls (HC), and 2) to assess the impact of symptom activity.A controlled cross-sectional study was conducted. Patients with IBS and IBD were recruited in several primary, secondary, and tertiary medical care units between 02 and 12/2017 in Germany. Overall, 381 matched participants (127/group, 63% female) were included. For the second analyses, patients with IBD were distinguished in patients with active (n = 93) and non-active (n = 34) symptoms. Psychological distress (somatization, depression, anxiety, and illness anxiety) and risk factors (adverse childhood experiences, attachment style, and mentalizing capacity) were measured.Patients with IBS showed higher psychological distress and more psychological risk factors than patients with IBD and HC. However, patients with IBD and active symptoms showed similar psychological distress than patients with IBS, except for lower illness anxiety (p < .001, η = 0.069).With the exception of higher illness anxiety in IBS patients, differences in psychological factors between patients with IBS and IBD were more strongly associated with symptom activity than with the underlying diagnosis. Therefore, this study challenges previous concepts of distinguishing functional and organic gastrointestinal , but highlights the role of symptom activity and illness anxiety.DRKS00011685.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of anastomotic ulcers on Crohn's  recurrence in patients with prior ileocolic resections. Secondary aims included defining the prevalence of anastomotic ulcers, risk factors for development, and their natural history.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing an ileocolic resection between 2008 and 2017 at a large academic center, with a postoperative colonoscopy assessing the neoterminal ileum and ileocolic anastomosis. The primary outcome was  recurrence defined as endoscopic recurrence (>5 ulcers in the neoterminal ileum) or need for another ileocolic resection among patients with or without an anastomotic ulcer in endoscopic remission.One hundred eighty-two subjects with Crohn's  and an ileocolic resection were included. Anastomotic ulcers were present in 95 (52.2%) subjects. No factors were associated with anastomotic ulcer development. One hundred eleven patients were in endoscopic remission on the first postoperative colonoscopy. On multivariable analysis, anastomotic ulcers were associated with  recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.64; 95% CI, 1.21-10.95; P = 0.02). Sixty-six subjects with anastomotic ulcers underwent a second colonoscopy, with 31 patients (79.5%) having persistent ulcers independent of medication escalation.Anastomotic ulcers occur in over half of Crohn's  patients after ileocolic resection.

Understanding these geographical differences is crucial for formulating effective strategies for preventing and treating IBD. We report the prevalence, mortality, and overall burden of IBD in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017, based on data from the Global Burden of , Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017.We modelled mortality due to IBD using a standard Cause of Death Ensemble model including data mainly from vital registrations. To estimate the non-fatal burden, we used data presented in primary studies, hospital discharges, and claims data, and used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to ensure consistency between measures. Mortality, prevalence, years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated. All of the estimates were reported as numbers and rates per 100 000 population, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI).In 2017, there were 6·8 million (95% UI 6·4-7·3) cases of IBD globally. The age-standardised prevalence rate increased from 79·5 (75·9-83·5) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 84·3 (79·2-89·9) per 100 000 population in 2017. The age-standardised death rate decreased from 0·61 (0·55-0·69) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 0·51 (0·42-0·54) per 100 000 population in 2017. At the GBD regional level, the highest age-standardised prevalence rate in 2017 occurred in high-income North America (422·0 [398·7-446·1] per 100 000) and the lowest age-standardised prevalence rates were observed in the Caribbean (6·7 [6·3-7·2] per 100 000 population). High Socio-demographic Index (SDI) locations had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate, while low SDI regions had the lowest age-standardised prevalence rate. At the national level, the USA had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate (464·5 [438·6-490·9] per 100 000 population), followed by the UK (449·6 [420·6-481·6] per 100 000). Vanuatu had the highest age-standardised death rate in 2017 (1·8 [0·8-3·2] per 100 000 population) and Singapore had the lowest (0·08 [0·06-0·14] per 100 000 population). The total YLDs attributed to IBD almost doubled over the study period, from 0·56 million (0·39-0·77) in 1990 to 1·02 million (0·71-1·38) in 2017. The age-standardised rate of DALYs decreased from 26·5 (21·0-33·0) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 23·2 (19·1-27·8) per 100 000 population in 2017.The prevalence of IBD increased substantially in many regions from 1990 to 2017, which might pose a substantial social and economic burden on governments and health systems in the coming years.

Multiple clinical and animal data have shown that  is associated with a healthy mucosa. However, its precise role in colitis is currently unknown. Our study aimed to determine its protective effects and underlying mechanisms in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Twenty-four C57BL/6 male mice were administered  Muc or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once daily by oral gavage for 14 days. Colitis was induced by drinking 2% DSS from days 0 to 6, followed by 2 days of drinking normal water. Mice were weighed daily and then sacrificed on day 8. We found that  improved DSS-induced colitis, which was evidenced by reduced weight loss, colon length shortening and histopathology scores and enhanced barrier function. Serum and tissue levels of  cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, IL1α, IL6, IL12A, MIP-1A, G-CSF, and KC) decreased as a result of  administration. Analysis of 16S rDNA sequences showed that  induced significant gut microbiota alterations. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated that pro- cytokines and other injury factors were negatively associated with , , and , which were prominently abundant in -treated mice. We confirmed that  treatment could ameliorate mucosal inflammation either via microbe-host interactions, which protect the gut barrier function and reduce the levels of  cytokines, or by improving the microbial community. Our findings suggest that  may be a potential probiotic agent for ameliorating colitis.Copyright © 2019 Bian, Wu, Yang, Lv, Wang, Li, Ye, Fang, Wu, Jiang, Shi and Li.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629989>Monitoring of infliximab trough levels and anti-infliximab antibodies in : A comparison of three commercially available ELISA kits.</a></h2><p>There are many studies presenting data of biologics and several ELISA kits commercially available for monitoring infliximab serum trough levels (s-IFXt) and anti-drug antibodies (ADAb). We propose to compare technical characteristics and results of three different assays on a cohort of 35 patients under infliximab (IFX) and suffering from  (IBD).s-IFXt and ADAb were systematically measured with three ELISA kits: Lisa-Tracker® Duo infliximab (Theradiag®), Ridascreen® IFX Monitoring (R-Biopharm AG®) and Promonitor® IFX (Progenika Biopharma SA®).The main technical features that differed between kits for measuring s-IFXt were: (i) TNF coating, (ii) immune complexes revelation strategy and/or (iii) interference with other anti-TNFα agents. For kits measuring ADAb, they were revelation steps and unit of results. There was an excellent mathematical correlation of s-IFXt between assays however Bland-Altman analysis denoted (i) s-IFXt were on average 48 to 69% higher in Ridascreen® than in the other two assays, and (ii) elevated s-IFXt were higher with Promonitor® compared to Lisa-Tracker®. As a consequence, there were some substantial discrepancies between assays for classification of s-IFXt into concentration ranges. Despite unstandardized units, pairwise qualitative comparison showed a perfect agreement between the three pairs of ADAb assays.Our data show that the evaluated assays are not quantitatively interchangeable due to substantial variations in some results that could lead, for some patients, to divergent therapeutic decisions. We remind to be cautious when comparing study results issued from different kits and recommend using the same assay for the longitudinal follow-up of IBD patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Ex Rowl) juice on acetic acid-induced colitis in rats.</a></h2><p> (IBD) is characterized by severe mucosal damage in the intestine and a deregulated immune response. Natural products derived from plants that are rich in bioactive compounds are used by many patients with IBD. Xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei) is a cactus of the Caatinga family that has been used by the local population for food and medicinal purposes. The intestinal anti- effect of xique-xique cladode juice was evaluated in the present study. A dose of 5 mL kg-1 had a protective effect on intestinal inflammation, with an improvement in macroscopic damage, and a decrease in pro- markers and oxidative stress, in addition to preserving the colonic tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the downregulation of IL-17, NF-κB, and iNOS, and upregulation of SOCs-1, ZO-1, and MUC-2. These protective effects could be attributed to the phenolic compounds as well as the fibers present in xique-xique juice. Further studies are needed before suggesting the use of xique-xique juice as a new alternative for treating IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639191>Editorial on Hirten et al.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639807>Persistence with Biologic Treatment in Patients with : A German Claims Data Analysis.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to assess the real-world rates of treatment discontinuation and switching of biologic therapies in patients with  (IBD).A retrospective claims data analysis on all continuously insured adult IBD patients with initiation of a biologic therapy was conducted. Observation started with the date of the first prescription of index tumor necrosis factor α-inhibitors (anti-TNFα) or vedolizumab (VDZ) therapy and lasted 12 months. Non-persistence was assumed in case of a switch to another biologic or a treatment gap of >90 days.We included 1,248 IBD biologic treatment starters (502 adalimumab, 77 golimumab, 441 infliximab, 228 VDZ); 837/411 were biologic-naïve (bio-naïve)/ biologic-experienced (bio-experienced). Mean age of bio-naïve/bio-experienced anti-TNFα patients was 39.2/38.1 years (54.9%/56.7% female) and 42.6/37.8 years for VDZ patients (56.3%/54.9% female). Seven hundred and seventy-two patients (61.9%) were persistent with their index biologic therapy after 12 months (61.9%/61.8% bio-naïve/bio-experienced). Percentage of persistent patients was 69.7% for VDZ (65.6%/71.3%) and 60.1% for anti-TNFα (61.4%/55.5%). VDZ was associated with later non-persistence in a multivariable Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 0.675; p = 0.003) compared to anti-TNFα.Only 60-70% of IBD -patients are still persistent with their biologic therapy after 12 months. VDZ therapy is associated with a higher persistence than anti-TNFα therapy in this analysis.© 2019 S.

We aimed to assess patients with UC-PSC or UC alone and describe differences in clinical and phenotypic characteristics, antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, and long-term clinical outcomes.This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients who received a diagnosis of UC from 1962 through 2015. We evaluated clinical factors associated with UC-PSC vs UC alone and assessed associations by using multivariable logistic regression models.Among 522 patients with UC, 56 (10.7%) had PSC. Compared with UC alone, patients with UC-PSC were younger (younger than 20 years) at diagnosis (odds ratios [OR], 2.35; adjusted P = 0.02) and had milder UC severity (adjusted P = 0.05), despite having pancolonic involvement (OR, 7.01; adjusted P < 0.001). In the biologics era (calendar year 2005 to 2015), patients with UC-PSC less commonly received anti-TNF therapy compared with patients with UC (OR, 0.38; adjusted P = 0.009), but their response rates were similar. Fewer patients with UC-PSC received corticosteroids (OR, 0.24; adjusted P = 0.005) or rectal 5-aminosalicyte acid (OR, 0.26; adjusted P < 0.001). Other differences were identified that were not statistically significant in a multivariable model: patients with UC-PSC more commonly were male, had lower rates of smoking, and had higher rates of colorectal cancer and colectomy.This study identified a unique phenotype of UC with concurrent PSC, which had different clinical behavior compared with UC only. These phenotypic characteristics can help identify high-risk patients with UC before PSC is diagnosed and guide different management and monitoring strategies.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

The aim of this study was to determine the association with  activity and intestinal permeability.Uc.261 level in colon mucosa and Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) were evaluated in 20 active CD patients. Uc.261 expression and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) were determined in Caco2 and T84 cells treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), respectively. Body weight,  activity index (DAI), colon length, histological index (HI), intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran, uc.261, and tight junction proteins (TJPs) levels were evaluated in BALB/C mice treated with saline enema, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)/ethanol enema, and anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody injection, respectively.Uc.261 expression was overexpressed in CD patients, TNF-α treated cells, and colitis mice. Uc.261 expression was positively correlated with HBI ( = 0.582,  = 0.007) in CD patients, and positively correlated with TNF-α concentration and negatively correlated TEER in Caco2 and T84 cells (all  < 0.05). Furthermore, uc.261 was positively correlated with DAI ( = 0.824,  = 0.008), HI ( = 0.672,  = 0.021), and intestinal permeability ( = 0.636,  = 0.012), while negatively correlated with body weight ( = -0.574,  = 0.035), colon length ( = -0.866,  = 0.017), and TJP expression (all  < 0.05) in colitis mice.Uc.261 expression was closely correlated with  activity and intestinal permeability in CD. Anti-TNF-α treatment may play its role through suppressing uc.261 expression in colitis mice.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640916>Long-term outcome of immunomodulator use in pediatric patients with .</a></h2><p>In the era where new biologicals are entering the market, the place of immunomodulators in the treatment of pediatric  (IBD) needs to be reassessed.All children with Crohn's  (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) followed at our center over the last 10 years were reviewed. Children who received conventional therapy (including 5-aminosalicylates, steroids, thiopurines and methotrexate) since diagnosis were included. Primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission without need for rescue therapy (biologics or surgery) at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis and at last follow-up. Cox proportional hazard modelling was performed to determine variables at diagnosis associated with outcomes.In total, 176 IBD patients (121 CD, 55 UC) were identified with a median follow-up of 4.6 [2.0-8.1] years. Remission rates were 79.6% at month 6, but decreased to 60.2% at month 12, and 31.8% at last follow-up. Higher CRP [1.006 (1.001-1.011)], lower albumin [1.050 (1.012-1.086)] and growth impairment [1.214 (1.014-1.373)] in CD patients and higher PUCAI score [1.038 (1.006-1.072)] and low iron [1.023 (1.003-1.043)] in UC patients were associated with treatment failure (all p < 0.05).Only 32% pediatric IBD patients will remain free of biologics or surgery 5-years after diagnosis. Especially children with a high  burden at diagnosis were more likely to fail conventional therapy.Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p></html>
