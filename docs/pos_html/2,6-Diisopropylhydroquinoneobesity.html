Protein kinases are implicated in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. Molecular mechanisms underlying OIR involving global kinase activities remain incompletely understood.To investigate abnormal kinase activity associated with OIR in human skeletal muscle.Stable isotopic labeling-based quantitative proteomics combined with affinity-based​​ active enzyme probes to profile in vivo kinase activity in skeletal muscle from lean control (Lean) and OIR participants.Eight Lean and eight OIR non-diabetic human adults who underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with muscle biopsy.We identified the 1st active kinome comprised of 54 active protein kinases in human skeletal muscle. The activities of 23 kinases were different in OIR compared to Lean muscle (11 hyper- and 12 hypo-active), while their protein abundance was the same between the two groups. The activities of multiple kinases involved in AMPK and p38 signaling were lower in OIR compared to Lean. On the contrary, multiple kinases in the JNK signaling pathway exhibited higher activity in OIR vs. Lean. The kinase-substrate-prediction based on experimental data further confirmed a potential down-regulation of insulin signaling (e.g., inhibited phosphorylation of IRS1 and AKT1/).These findings provide a global view of the kinome activity in OIR and Lean muscle, pinpoint novel specific impairment in kinase activities in signaling pathways important for skeletal muscle insulin resistance and may provide potential drug targets (i.e., abnormal kinase activities) to prevent and/or reverse skeletal muscle insulin resistance in humans.© Endocrine Society 2019.

The comparative efficacy of various bariatric procedures for the remission of type  diabetes has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to compare the effects of the two most common bariatric procedures, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, on remission of diabetes and β-cell function.We conducted a single-centre, triple-blind, randomised trial at Vestfold Hospital Trust (Tønsberg, Norway), in which patients (aged ≥18 years) with type  diabetes and  were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy (the Oseberg study). Randomisation was performed with a computerised random number generator and a block size of 10. Treatment allocation was masked from participants, study personnel, and outcome assessors and was concealed with sealed opaque envelopes. Surgeons used identical skin incisions during both surgeries and were not involved in patient follow-up. The primary clinical outcome was the proportion of participants with complete remission of type  diabetes (HbA of ≤6·0% [42 mmol/mol] without the use of glucose-lowering medication) at 1 year after surgery. The primary physiological outcome was disposition index (a measure of β-cell function) at 1 year after surgery, as assessed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Primary outcomes were analysed in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. This trial is ongoing and closed to recruitment, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, .Between Oct 15, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017, 1305 patients who were preparing for bariatric surgery were screened, of whom 319 consecutive patients with type  diabetes were assessed for eligibility. 109 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to gastric bypass (n=54) or sleeve gastrectomy (n=55). 107 (98%) of 109 patients completed 1-year follow-up, with one patient in each group withdrawing after surgery (per-protocol population). In the intention-to-treat population, diabetes remission rates were higher in the gastric bypass group than in the sleeve gastrectomy group (risk difference 27% [95% CI 10 to 44]; relative risk [RR] 1·57 [1·14 to ·16], p=0·0054); results were similar in the per-protocol population (risk difference 27% [95% CI 10 to 45]; RR 1·57 [1·14 to ·15], p=0·0036). In the intention-to-treat population, disposition index increased in both groups (between-group difference 55 [-111 to 220], p=0·52); results were similar in the per-protocol population (between-group difference 21 [-214 to 256], p=0.86). In the gastric bypass group, ten of 54 participants had early complications and 17 of 53 had late side-effects. In the sleeve gastrectomy group, eight of 55 participants had early complications and 22 of 54 had late side-effects. No deaths occurred in either group.Gastric bypass was found to be superior to sleeve gastrectomy for remission of type  diabetes at 1 year after surgery, and the two procedures had a similar beneficial effect on β-cell function. The use of gastric bypass as the preferred bariatric procedure for patients with  and type  diabetes could improve diabetes care and reduce related societal costs.Morbid  Centre, Vestfold Hospital Trust.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Anthropometric measurements, body composition (BIA), aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and food preferences were assessed in 19 healthy normal-weight young adults (21 ± 0.5 years old, 10 men). They randomly completed 3 experimental sessions: i) control session without exercise (CON); ii) High Intensity exercise session (HIE); iii) Low intensity exercise session (LIE). Thirty minutes after exercise or rest, then received a fixed lunch. Food reward (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire) was assessed before and after the meal. Appetite sensations were assessed at regular intervals, SQ was calculated from the lunch meal and self-reported food intake was collected for the rest of the day. Mean body weight was 66.7 ± 9. kg, body mass index was 22.3 ± .9 kg/m and FM% was 18.7 ± 6.8%. Appetite feelings did not differ between conditions and were not affected by exercise. SQ for satiety was not different between conditions. SQ hunger on CON was significantly higher than on LIE and HIE (p ≤ 0.05) with no difference between exercise conditions. SQ for desire to eat was significantly higher on CON versus HIE (p ≤ 0.01) with no differences between CON and LIE and between exercise sessions. SQ PFC was significantly lower on HIE compared with CON (p = 0.02) with no differences between LIE and CON and between LIE and HIE. Food reward was not significantly different between the three condition as well as self-reported total food and macronutrient intake for the rest of the days. Acute exercise, depending on its intensity, might affect the satiating response to food intake in healthy adults, without altering food reward.Copyright © 2019.

Many prospective studies have reported the benign condition relating the MHO phenotype and its potential role in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. However, inconsistent results were found and the question remains controversial. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the associations these associations from relevant prospective studies.The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 statement was used to prepare this protocol. MEDLINE, Web of Science databases, EMBASE and Cochrane Database will be used for literature search from their inception up to December 2019 with restriction of published studies in English. Published prospective studies reporting adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates for the association between MHO phenotype and cardiovascular disease, total cancer, all-cause or cause-specific mortality will be included. The process of study screening, selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers, and the risk of bias for the studies included will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. HRs or RRs for disease events and mortality with 95% CIs will be considered as primary outcomes, and summary HRs/RRs will be pooled using random-effects models. The Cochrane's Q and the I statistics will be used to assess and quantify heterogeneity, respectively. Subgroup analysis will also be carried out according to study characteristics to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity.As this meta-analysis is performed based on the published studies, no ethical approval and patient safety considerations are required.

Our objective was to determine the rate of delayed graft function (DGF) in patients on preoperative PD. Additionally, we sought to identify which patients can safely have their PD catheter removed during transplantation due to a low risk of DGF.We conducted a retrospective observational study between June 2011 and December 2015. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of DGF, defined as the need for dialysis within the first week of transplantation. Clinical and transplant factors, including graft type and donor criteria, were assessed for association with the primary outcome. Catheter-related complication rates were also compared between post-transplant PD and hemodialysis (HD).Of our cohort of 567 patients, 145 patients (25.6%) developed DGF.  (odds ratio [OR] 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.11; p=0.04) and increased perioperative blood loss (OR 1.002; 95% CI 1.000-1.003; p=0.03) were predictors of DGF. Protective factors included living donor (LD) grafts (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05-0.49; p=0.002) and intraoperative graft urine production (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.23-0.65; p<0.001). In our PD cohort, only LD grafts demonstrated lower DGF rates (0 LD vs. 20.8% deceased donor; p=0.003). In terms of post-transplant renal replacement therapy, patients on PD and HD had similar duration of temporary dialysis (one day PD vs. two days HD; p=0.48) and catheter-related complication rates (4.5% PD vs. .6% HD; p=0.30).Carefully selected patients, such as those receiving LD grafts, may benefit from concurrent PD catheter removal.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675433>Simultaneous angiotensin receptor blockade and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation ameliorate albuminuria in obese insulin-resistant rats.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance increases renal oxidant production by up-regulating NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression contributing to oxidative damage and ultimately albuminuria. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signaling may reverse this effect. However, whether angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation improve oxidative damage and albuminuria through different mechanisms is not known. Using insulin resistant Otsuka Long Evan Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneous blockade of AT1 and activation of GLP-1r additively decrease oxidative damage and urinary albumin excretion (U V) in the following groups: (1) untreated, lean LETO (n=7), () untreated, obese OLETF (n=9), (3) OLETF + angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; 10 mg olmesartan /kg/d; n=9), (4) OLETF + GLP-1 mimetic (EXE; 10 ug exenatide/kg/d; n=7), and (5) OLETF + ARB + exenatide (Combo; n=6). Mean kidney Nox4 protein expression and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were 30% and 46% greater, respectively, in OLETF compared to LETO. Conversely, Nox4 protein expression and NT were reduced to LETO levels in ARB and EXE, and Combo reduced Nox4, NT, and 4-hydroxy--nonenal levels by 21%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. At baseline, U V was nearly double in OLETF compared to LETO, and increased to nearly 10-fold greater levels by the end of the study. While ARB (45%) and EXE (55%) individually reduced U V, the combination completely ameliorated the albuminuria. Collectively, these data suggest that AT1 blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation reduce renal oxidative damage similarly during insulin resistance, while targeting both signaling pathways provides added benefit in restoring and/or further ameliorating albuminuria in a model of diet-induced .© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675427>Effect of Metabolic Traits on the Risk of Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Cancer in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common liver condition. Predicting its progression could help clinicians manage and potentially prevent complications. We evaluated the independent and joint effects of metabolic traits on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with NAFLD. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008 with follow-up through 12/31/2015. We performed competing risk, adjusted cause-specific Cox models to evaluate the effects of metabolic traits (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, ) as additive or combined indicators on time to develop cirrhosis or HCC or a composite endpoint of both. Of the 271,906 patients, 22,794 developed cirrhosis, and 253 developed HCC during a mean of 9 years follow up. At baseline, the mean BMI was 31.6 (SD, 5.6), 28.7% had diabetes, 70.3% hypertension, and 62.3% had dyslipidemia with substantial overlap among the these traits. The risk of progression was the lowest in patients with only one or no metabolic trait. There was a stepwise increase in risk with each additional metabolic trait. Compared to patients with no metabolic trait, patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia had 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis/HCC (hazard ratio (HR) =1.8, 95% CI=1.59-.06); the risk was .6-fold higher in patients with diabetes, , dyslipidemia and hypertension (HR=.6, 95% CI=.3,.9). These associations were stronger for HCC. Diabetes had the strongest association with HCC in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Each additional metabolic trait increased the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in patients with NAFLD. Diabetes conferred the highest risk of progression to HCC.

Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin  (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small lipid droplets around mitochondrial chains, and 5- to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (>5 min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially beneficial against AF in patients with  or diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672599>Heptamethoxyflavone inhibits adipogenesis via enhancing PKA signaling.</a></h1><p>3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone (HMF), a naturally occurring polymethoxyflavone found in citrus peel, is known to have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. However, the effects of HMF on adipogenesis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HMF inhibits the early stage of adipogenesis and maturation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. HMF treatment during preadipocyte differentiation for 8 days reduced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression levels of key adipogenic transcription factors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα)) and the lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1), were lower after the initial 4 days of the differentiation. Moreover, PPARγ expression level was lower even after the initial  days, but C/EBPα and SREBP1 expression was not. HMF upregulated the phosphorylation of protein kinase A catalytic subunit α (PKACα), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 3T3-L1 cells. The phosphorylation of ACC leads to the inhibition of adipogenesis. Furthermore, the induction of phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC by HMF was abolished by RNA interference targeting PKACα. Taken together, our results suggest that HMF might inhibit the early stage of adipogenesis via the activation of PKA signaling in 3T3-L1 cells.Copyright © 2019.

Metabolic challenges such as the one posed by high fructose intake are important determinants of disease mechanisms. We embarked on studies to determine how fructose affects differential metabolic dysfunctions across genetically dissimilar mice, namely, C57BL/6 J (B6), DBA/ J (DBA) and FVB/NJ (FVB), by integrating physiological and gene regulatory mechanisms. We report that fructose has strain-specific effects, involving tissue-specific gene regulatory cascades in hypothalamus, liver, and white adipose tissues. DBA mice showed the largest numbers of genes associated with adiposity, congruent with their highest susceptibility to adiposity gain and glucose intolerance across the three tissues. In contrast, B6 and FVB mainly exhibited cholesterol phenotypes, accompanying the largest number of adipose genes correlating with total cholesterol in B6, and liver genes correlating with LDL in FVB mice. Tissue-specific network modeling predicted strain-and tissue-specific regulators such as Fgf21 (DBA) and Lss (B6), which were subsequently validated in primary hepatocytes. Strain-specific fructose-responsive genes revealed susceptibility for human diseases such that genes in liver and adipose tissue in DBA showed strong enrichment for human type  diabetes and  traits. Liver and adipose tissues genes in FVB were mostly related to lipid traits, and liver and adipose genes in B6 showed relevance to most cardiometabolic traits tested. Our results show that fructose induces gene regulatory pathways that are tissue specific and dependent on the genetic make-up, which may underlie interindividual variability in cardiometabolic responses to high fructose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

Thus, DOAC therapy in this population remains controversial.  To investigate rivaroxaban as a safe and effective alternative to warfarin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment and prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation identified as extremely obese or of high body weight.  A retrospective chart review was performed at  academic medical centers in patients ≥18 years old and BMI >40 kg/m or weight >120 kg, newly initiated on warfarin or rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation or VTE treatment. The primary end point was incidence of clinical failure, defined as VTE recurrence, stroke incidence, and mortality, within 12 months of initiation. Secondary end points included length of stay (LOS) and bleeding complications.  A total of 176 patients were included, with 84 and 92 patients in the rivaroxaban and warfarin arms, respectively.

Major facilitator superfamily domain 3 (MFSD3) is a family of membrane-bound solute carriers whose expression has been recently associated with nutrient intake and adipose tissue homeostasis. This study aimed to evaluate a possible association between MFSD3 preoperative methylation pattern and weight regain after bariatric surgery.This is a longitudinal study comprising 24 obese (body mass index > 35 m/kg) women submitted to gastric bypass. Anthropometric measurements were evaluated at preoperative time and 1, , and 3 y after surgery, and then weight regain was calculated. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes and was bisulfite modified by specific kits, according manufacturer's instructions. Methylation analysis was performed with the Infinium Human Methylation 450 K bead chip technology, and methylation level was expressed as a β value ranging from 0 (unmethylated) to 1 (fully methylated). Shapiro-Wilk, repeated-means analysis of variance, Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney, and independent t tests were used in statistical analysis (P < 0.05).A total of 25% of patients regained significant weight. Weight regain after bariatric surgery was positively correlated with cg00010266 MFSD3 preoperative methylation levels (r = 0.6804, P = 0.0126). Moreover, cg00010266 MFSD3 baseline methylation levels were significantly higher in regainer patients than non-regainers (6. ± 1.5 versus 3.9 ± 1.%, P = 0.026). Patients allocated in the higher cg00010266 MFSD3 preoperative methylation group had higher weight regain (4.1 ± 1.8 versus 6.7 ± . kg, P = 0.037).Preoperative hypermethylation of MFSD3 gene is significantly associated with weight regain and a worse response to gastric bypass.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Pterostilbene is a useful bioactive compound in preventing type 1 diabetes, insulin resistance and type  diabetes in animal models. Concerning type 1 diabetes, the main mechanisms described to justify the positive effects of this phenolic compound are increased liver glycogen content and hepatic glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities, the recovery of pancreatic islet architecture, cytoprotection and a decrease in serum and pancreatic pro-inflammatory cytokines. As for type  diabetes, increased liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase and decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activities are reported. When insulin resistance is induced by diets, a greater activation of insulin signaling cascade has been reported, increased cardiotrophin-1 levels and liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities, and a decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activity. Data concerning pterostilbene and liver steatosis are scarce so far, but the reduction in oxidative stress induced by pterostilbene may be involved since oxidative stress is related to the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis. Finally, pterostilbene effectivelly reduces total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, while increases HDL-cholesterol in animal models of dyslipidemia.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677232>Five-year cumulative incidence of overweight and , and longitudinal change in body mass index in Japanese workers: The Japan Epidemiology Collaboration on Occupational Health Study.</a></h1><p>The present study aimed to estimate cumulative incidence of overweight and  and describe 5-year longitudinal changes in body mass index (BMI) in a large occupational cohort in Japan.Participants were 55 229 Japanese employees, who were aged 20-59 years and attended at all subsequent annual health check-ups between 2009 and 2014. Mixed model analysis was performed to examine the effects of age and cohort by gender on BMI change, with age as a random variable. Cumulative incidence of overweight (23.0≤ BMI <27.5 kg/m ) and  (BMI ≥27.5 kg/m ) was calculated. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios for the incidence of overweight and  according to age group.The incidence of overweight and  was approximately double in men (28.3% and 6.7%, respectively) compared to women (14.3% and 3.9%, respectively).The incidence of  decreased with age in men, but did not differ according to age in women (P for trend: .02 and .89, respectively). Among overweight participants, the incidence of  was higher in women (18.9%) than men (14.5%) and decreased with advancing age (P for trend: <.001 in men and .003 in women). Mean BMI was higher in men than women in all age groups throughout the period. Younger cohorts tended to have a higher BMI change compared with older cohorts.In this Japanese occupational cohort, transition from overweight to  is higher in women than men, and the more recent cohorts had a higher change in mean BMI than the older cohorts.© 2019 The Authors.

We postulated that Chinese women with PCOS would have higher risk of incident diabetes and cardiometabolic abnormalities than those without PCOS during long-term follow-up.One hundred ninety-nine Chinese women with PCOS diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria and with a mean age of 41. years (SD = 6.4) completed a follow-up evaluation after an average of 10.6 ± 1.3 years. Two hundred twenty-five women without PCOS (mean age: 54.1 ± 6.7 years) who underwent baseline and follow-up evaluation over the same period were used for comparison. Progression of glycaemic status of women both with and without PCOS was assessed by using 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) screening with the adoption of 2009 American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria. The frequency of impaired glucose regulation, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia of women with PCOS at follow-up has increased from 31.7% (95% CI 25.%-38.1%) to 47.% (95% CI 40.3%-54.%), 16.1% (95% CI 11.0%-21.%) to 34.7% (95% CI 28.1%-41.3%), and 52.3% (95% CI 45.3%-59.%) to 64.3% (95% CI 57.7%-71.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in follow-up women with PCOS is 26.1% (95% CI 20.0%-32.%), almost double that in the cohort of women without PCOS (p < 0.001). Age-standardised incidence of diabetes among women with PCOS was 22.12 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 10.86-33.37) compared with the local female population incidence rate of 8.76 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.72-8.80) and 10.09 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 4.92-15.26, p < 0.001) for women without PCOS in our study. Incidence rate for women with PCOS aged 30-39 years was 20.56 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 12.57-31.87), which is approximately 10-fold higher than that of the age-matched general female population in Hong Kong (1.88 per 1,000 person-years, [95% CI 1.85-1.92]). The incidence rate of type  DM (T2DM) of both normal-weight and overweight women with PCOS was around double that of corresponding control groups (normal weight: 8.96 [95% CI 3.92-17.72] versus 4.86 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI .13-9.62], p > 0.05; overweight/obese: 28.64 [95% CI 19.55-40.60] versus 14.1 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 8.20-22.76], p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified that baseline waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio [OR] = 1.71 [95% CI 1.08-.69], p < 0.05) and elevated triglyceride (OR = 6.63 [95% CI 1.23-35.69], p < 0.05) are associated with the progression to T2DM in PCOS. Limitations of this study include moderate sample size with limited number of incident diabetes during follow-up period and potential selection bias.High risk of diabetes and increased cardiovascular disease risk factors among Chinese women with PCOS are highlighted in this long-term follow-up study. Diabetes onset was, on average, 10 years earlier among women with PCOS than in women without PCOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667587>Association between visceral abdominal  and long-segment Barrett's esophagus in a Japanese population.</a></h1><p>Visceral abdominal  is associated with Barrett's esophagus (BE), especially long-segment BE (≥ 3 cm) (LSBE), in white individuals. However, the association between central  and LSBE has not been well investigated in Asia. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between central  and LSBE in the Japanese population.A total of 38,298 healthy subjects who took medical surveys between April 2006 and November 2018 were enrolled. We investigated the association between LSBE and central  indices [visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and the VAT to SAT ratio (VAT/SAT)] using a multivariable logistic regression model.A total of 37,686 subjects were eligible for the analysis. LSBE rates in the middle and high VAT/SAT groups were higher than those in the low VAT/SAT group [odds ratio (OR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-.69 for middle vs low; OR .02, 95% CI 1.17-3.49 for high vs low). These associational trends between VAT/SAT and LSBE remained in subgroups with and without reflux esophagitis. From subgroup analyses by SAT, we found that the OR between VAT and LSBE is higher in the low SAT subgroup (OR .43, 95% CI 1.34-4.40 for middle vs low; OR .55, 95% CI 1.01-6.40 for high vs low); but not large or imprecise due to limited event numbers in the middle and high SAT subgroups.VAT was associated with LSBE, especially among subjects with low SAT accumulation, who are seemingly not obese. VAT/SAT was associated with LSBE regardless of the presence of reflux esophagitis in a Japanese population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662399>Cross-sectional study of the health of southern African truck drivers.</a></h1><p>Lifestyle and working conditions of truck drivers predisposes them to risk-factors associated with communicable and non-communicable diseases, but little is known about the health status of African truck driver. This study aims to assess a cross-section of truckers in South Africa to describe their health information.The study took place across three truck-stop rest areas in the South African provinces of Free State and Gauteng.Eligibility criteria included being males aged 18 years and older, full-time employment as a long-distance truck driver. A total of 614 male truck drivers participated; 384 (63%) were Zimbabwean and 325 (55%) completed high-school.The trucker survey explored demographics; working conditions; sexual, eating and sleeping behaviours; mental health status, medical history and cardiac risk-factors. Medical assessments included physical measurements, glucose and lipid measurements, ECG, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and cardiac ultrasound.In the previous month, 554 (91%) participants were sexually active; 522 (86%) had sex with a regular partner; 174 (27%) with a casual partner; 87 (14%) with a sex worker. Average time driving was 10 hours/day, 20 days/month, 302 (50%) never worked night shifts and 74 (12%) worked nights approximately four times per week. 112 (18%) experienced daytime sleepiness and 59 (10%) were ever hospitalised from an accident. Forty-seven (8%, 95% CI 5.3 to 9.5) were HIV-positive, with half taking antiretrovirals. Forty-eight (8%) truckers had some moderate depression, while 21 (4%) suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Reported tuberculosis, myocardial infarction, and diabetes were <3%. Prominent cardiac risk-factors included smoking (n=63, 11%), consuming alcohol (>15 drinks/week) (n=54, 9%), overweight/ (n=417, 69%), and hypertension (n=220, 36%,95% CI 32.1 to 39.7). ECG results showed 23 (4.9%) and 29 (5.3%) drivers had left ventricular hypertrophy using the Cornell criterion and product, respectively. CIMT measurements indicated nine (4.%) drivers had a carotid atherosclerotic plaque.This first holistic assessment of health among southern African male truck drivers demonstrates substantial addressable cardiovascular risk factors, mental health issues and sexual risk behaviours.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of MetS and its associated risk factors among adult Palestinians using the International Diabetes Federation definition.A total of 1348 subjects ages 18-65 y were recruited in a cross-sectional study that was conducted in 2018-2019 in the northern West Bank.A total of 1082 subjects participated; 51.7% were men. The prevalence of MetS was high (44.9%), and higher among women (46.1%) than men (44.%) (p<0.001). The prevalence increased significantly with increasing age and body mass index (BMI) in both genders (p<0.001). However, metabolically obese but normal weight individuals (MONW) (8.4%) were also identified, with a slight increase among women (9.4%) compared with men (7.5%) (p=0.56). MetS was more likely to be prevalent among participants with increased fasting blood sugar (5.8 times), increased triglyceride (7.4 times), increased blood pressure (4.5 times) and BMI ≥25 (19.9 times) (p<0.001). The prevalence of MetS was higher among rural (50.3%) vs urban (39.3%) residents and refugees (33.8%).With increasing age and , clustering of MetS components increased remarkably in both genders. Effective prevention and treatment strategies for MetS and its risk factors should be developed targeting different ages and genders.© The Author(s) 2019.

Sargaquinoic acid (SQA) is a major component in MES. We investigated the effects of SQA on the differentiation of preadipocytes to the beige adipocytes. SQA was treated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated under a special condition that has been reported to induce the browning of adipocytes. SQA at 10 µM reduced lipid accumulation by approximately 23%. SQA at .5 - 10 µM induced the differentiation of white adipocytes to beige adipocytes partially by increasing the mitochondrial density and the expression of beige/brown adipocyte markers. In addition, SQA activated lipid catabolic pathways, evidenced by the increased expression levels of perilipin, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1. As a partial mechanism, biochemical and  analyses indicate that SQA activated AMP-activated protein kinase signaling in adipocytes.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655323>Night-time cardiac autonomic modulation as a function of sleep-wake stages is modified in otherwise healthy overweight adolescents.</a></h1><p>Even though sympathetic dominance during the daytime period is well known, currently, scarce data exist on autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation during sleep in pediatric . We aimed to evaluate sleep cardiac ANS regulation in normal-weight (NW) and overweight and obese (OW) adolescents.In this study, 60 healthy adolescents (15.7 ± 0.7 years) belonging to a birth cohort since infancy were classified based on body mass index percentiles criteria as: OW (N = 27) or NW (N = 33). Sleep was evaluated by polysomnography (PSG) during two consecutive in-lab overnight sessions. Non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep stages (stages 1, , and slow-wave sleep [SWS]), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and wakefulness (Wake) were scored. R-waves were detected automatically in the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal. An all-night heart rate variability analysis was conducted in the ECG signal, with several time- and frequency-domain measures calculated for each sleep-wake stage. Sleep time was divided into thirds (T1, T2, T3). The analysis was performed using a mixed-effects linear regression model.Sleep organization was comparable except for reduced REM sleep percentage in the OW group (p < 0.04). Shorter R-R intervals were found for all sleep stages in the OW group; time-domain measured standard deviation of all R-R intervals (RRSD) was lower during stage , SWS and REM sleep (all p < 0.05). The square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent R-R intervals (RMSSD) was also lower only during wake after sleep onset (WASO) in T1 and T3 (p < 0.05). The OW group had increased very low- and low-frequency (LF) power during WASO (in T1 and T2), and LF power during stage  and REM sleep (in T2). During WASO in the OW group, high-frequency (HF) power was lower (in T1 and T2), and LF/HF ratio was higher (in T2, p < 0.007).Several sleep-stage-dependent changes in cardiac autonomic regulation characterized the OW group. As sleep-related ANS balance was disturbed in the absence of concomitant metabolic alterations in this sample of otherwise healthy OW adolescents, their relevance for pediatric  should be further explored throughout development.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Participants completed an online survey about EWC awareness, its perceived effectiveness among parents and their meal planning practices (attitudes, behaviours and self-efficacy).A federal mass-media campaign disseminated by Health Canada (2013-2014) to promote meal planning to Canadian parents.Parents (n 964) of children aged -12 years from all Provinces and Territories.Of respondents, 41 % (390/964) were aware of the campaign; Quebec City and rural Quebec had the highest rates of awareness, whereas Vancouver, Winnipeg and Toronto had the lowest. Awareness was greater among parents with lower income, basic education and French-speakers. Campaign intensity was significantly associated with greater odds of reporting positive attitudes towards the EWC and meal planning (P < 0·05). Campaign awareness was significantly associated with greater odds of believing that meal planning helps maintain a healthy diet (OR = 1·68, 95 % CI 1·03, ·74) and planning meals (OR = 1·66, 95 % CI 1·03, ·54), but not self-efficacy, in adjusted models.The present study is the first to evaluate an initiative that promoted meal planning with mass media.

This study measures adolescents' social media engagement with food/beverage brands, sociodemographic differences in level of engagement, and relationships between engagement and screen time.Cross-sectional online survey of US adolescents (ages 13-17, N = 1,564), oversampled for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic (more- and less-acculturated) participants, assessed restaurant, food, and beverage brands ever liked, shared, or followed of on social media. Multivariate logistic regression models examined associations between brand engagement, sociodemographic variables (race/ethnicity, acculturation, age, gender, and parent education), and screen time (TV and other screens).Seventy percent of adolescents reported engaging with any food/beverage brands on social media (ranging from 1 to 48), and 35% engaged with 5 + brands. Non-Hispanic Black and less-acculturated Hispanic adolescents were more likely than non-Hispanic White adolescents to engage with brands. Approximately one-half reported engaging with brands of fast food (54% of participants), sugary drinks (50%), candy (46%), and snacks (45%), while just 7% reported engaging with all other categories of food/beverage brands. Watching TV more than  h-per-day was associated with any brand engagement; while using other screens more than 4 h-per-day was associated with following 5 + brands.Engagement with unhealthy food brands on social media is common among adolescents. Disproportionate engagement by non-Hispanic Black and less-acculturated Hispanic youth raises additional concerns.

Unsurprisingly, disruptions of the circadian rhythms through sleep curtailment or shift work have been connected through numerous studies to positive associations with , insulin resistance, and diabetes. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measures oscillation in messenger RNA expression, an essential foundation for the study of the physiological circadian regulatory network. Primarily, measured oscillations have involved the use of reference gene normalization. However, the validation and identification of suitable reference genes is a significant challenge across different biological systems. This study focuses on adipose tissue of premenopausal, otherwise healthy, morbidly obese women voluntarily enrolled after being scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Acquisition of tissue was accomplished by aspiratory needle biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue 1 to  weeks prior to surgery and 12 to 13 weeks following surgery and an in-surgery scalpel-assisted excision of mesenteric adipose tissue. Each biopsy was sterile cultured ex vivo and serially collected every 4 h over approximately 36 h. The candidate reference genes that were tested were 18S rRNA, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPII, RPL13α, and YWHAZ. Three analytic tools were used to test suitability, and the candidate reference genes were used to measure oscillation in expression of a known circadian clock element (Dbp). No gene was deemed suitable as an individual reference gene control, which indicated that the optimal reference gene set was the geometrically averaged 3-gene panel composed of YWHAZ, RPL13α, and GAPDH. These methods can be employed to identify optimal reference genes in other systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664909>Prevalence and associated anthropometric and lifestyle predictors of hypertension among adults in Kombolcha town and suburbs, Northeast Ethiopia: a community-based cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Hypertension (HTN) is major public health challenge. Data on HTN prevalence and associated risk factors is necessary to better control it. This study aimed at estimating the prevalence of HTN and associated anthropometric and lifestyle predictors in Kombolcha and suburbs, northeast Ethiopia.The study followed a community-based cross-sectional sampling design. Adult (≥18) residents of Kombolcha and suburbs in 11 kebeles (villages) formed the target population. Of these kebeles, 5(3 urban and  suburban) were selected randomly. Households (HHs) within the selected kebeles and individuals within HHs were similarly recruited in December 2016-May 2017. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were done.

Despite the critical role of the taste system in determining food selection and consumption, the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the peripheral taste system in mammals have received limited attention. We offered female Sprague Dawley rats free access to water and one of three diets for up to 40 days: (1) sucrose-free chow or "NS" diet; () a high-sucrose dry diet or "HS"; or (3) 30% sucrose solution and the NS diet, designated "LiqS" diet. Sucrose consumption by LiqS rats gradually increased and by day 14 was equal to that of HS rats. Food intake decreased in LiqS rats, but their energy intake remained higher than for NS or HS rats. There was no significant difference in weight gain of the groups during the study. Recordings from the chorda tympani nerve (CT), which innervates taste buds on the anterior tongue, revealed decreased responses to 1 M sucrose in both LiqS and HS rats and to acesulfame K and salt tastants in LiqS rats after 40 days on diet. Umami, bitter, and acid response magnitudes were unchanged in both groups. These results demonstrate that chronic sucrose exposure inhibits taste responses to higher concentrations of sweet stimuli. More surprisingly, CT responses to NaCl and 0.5M NaAc were significantly reduced in rats on the LiqS diet. Thus, the physical form of the diet influences taste responsiveness to salt and sweet taste function. These data suggest that taste buds are previously unappreciated targets of chronic sucrose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

Furthermore, -related adipokines have been shown to be closely related to the incidence of CRC, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of high-fat diet-induced adipokines and cytokines on the development of CRC in vitro and in vivo. For the in-vivo assays, we divided -week-old C57BL/6J-ApcMin/J male mice into three groups: normal-fat diet (ND), high-fat and high-sugar feed (HFHS), and high-fat and low-sugar feed (HFLS). After 1 week, all mice were injected with 20 mg/kg 1, -dimethylhydrazine once weekly for 10 consecutive weeks. Body weight, liver weight, epididymal fat weight, and blood glucose level were greatly increased in HFHS and HFLS groups compared with the ND group, and the expression levels of some adipokines and cytokines were obviously higher in HFHS or HFLS mice compared to ND mice. For the in-vitro assays, HCT116 CRC cells were treated with sera of ND, HFHS, or HFLS groups, or serum-free media (SFM) as a negative control. We observed that sera derived from HFHS or HFLS mice that contain excess adipokines and cytokines promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCT116 cells compared with ND-sera-conditioned medium or SFM group. Therefore, high-fat diet-induced adipokines and cytokines may promote the progression of CRC in vivo and in vitro.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid metabolism in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

The associations between prediagnostic total WCC and its subtypes and risk of all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality were assessed. The role of WCC related with smoking and BMI on mortality was further explored. Multivariate Cox regression models were performed to estimate the HR and 95% CI.After an average follow-up of 15.8 years, a total of 936 death cases were identified (466 cancer; 179 CVD; 291 other causes). Statistically significant graded associations between total WCC, and counts of lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils and risk of total mortality were observed. These associations were more apparent in current smokers. Strong associations for all-cause mortality or cancer mortality were observed in subjects with BMI ≥25 kg/m, ever smoking and elevated WCC (HR 3.92, 95% CI .76 to 5.57; HR 3.93, 95% CI .30 to 6.72). WCC partly mediated the associations between smoking or BMI and all-cause mortality.Prediagnostic WCC and its subtypes are associated with all-cause, cancer and CVD mortality risk.

The micro strains on the femur during single-leg stance of gait were measured on critical stress points based on the Gruen femoral zones.The micro strains increase as the weight increases implying that the displacement in the hip joint endoprosthesis is higher for overweight subjects enhancing the risk of failure. The highest increase was measured in Gruen zone 1 by 5.60% indicating that the great trochanter is subjected to higher stress shielding with increasing the weight. Also, the statistically significant increase of the micro strain values with increasing the weight in Gruen Zones 3 (.91%), 5 (1.56%), and 11 (1.75%) may enhance the risk for a periprosthetic fracture at the lower region of the prosthesis.This is the first biomechanical study which quantifies the effect of increasing weight loading conditions on the mechanical environment of the hip joint endoprosthesis considering different positions of evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

We evaluated SC function by assessing IB and AMH levels at baseline and after three months of each treatment in ten dysmetabolic obese subjects with low T levels. In all subjects,the influence of the clinical characteristics, metabolic and hormonal baseline parameters on SC and Leydig (LC) function, evaluated respectively with AMH, IB, FSH and T levels, were tested.No significant changes were observed for IB and AMH concentrations after each treatment period. Whereas T and estradiol (E2) levels were shown to be significantly higher in the CC plus metformin phase (CC/Met) only.

All types of clinical studies were considered. A total of  independent reviewers assessed quality using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria. Ratings were used to provide an overall score for each study (low, moderate, or high). Data were synthesized in evidence tables.From 233 potentially relevant publications, only 28 studies were included. Of these, 13 (46%) were randomized control trials, 11 were single-arm studies (39%), 3 were nonrandomized controlled trials (11%), and 1 study was a cluster randomized trial (4%). The studies were classified as low (15), high (7), and moderate (6) quality according to SIGN criteria.

The main management tool included in the apps was feedback messaging (24), followed by goal-setting mechanisms (20) and self-monitoring (19). The majority of studies took weight or body mass index loss as the main outcome (22) followed by changes in physical activity (14) and diet (12). Regarding outputs, usability, adherence, and engagement (17) were the most reported, followed by satisfaction (7) and acceptability (4).There is a remarkable heterogeneity among these studies and the majority have methodological limitations that leave considerable room for improvement.

In obese non-diabetic adolescents, we investigated if the OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak also reflects incretin and free fatty acid (FFA) responses besides insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, measured by the clamp.Obese adolescents (n=278) were categorized according to their OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak by Early-peak (at 30 min) vs. Late-peak (>30 min) groups. Body composition, visceral adipose tissue, oral disposition index (oDI) and OGTT-area under the curve (AUC) were examined. A subset of 102 participants had both hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps to measure in vivo insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity.Compared with the Early-peak group, the Late-peak group had impaired β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, lower glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)-AUC, and higher FFA-AUC despite higher insulin and C-peptide-AUC. They also had lower hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity despite similar percent body fat and visceral adipose tissue, and had higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (all P<0.05).In obese non-diabetic youth, those with a Late-peak vs. an Early-peak glucose during an OGTT showed diminished β-cell function, blunted incretin secretion, and lower insulin sensitivity of glucose and FFA metabolism.

The adiponectin subsequently imparts a crucial role in metabolic and hepato-inflammatory diseases. The most recent evidences indicate that lipotoxicity-induced inflammation in the liver is associated with -derived alterations and remolding in adipose tissue that culminates in most prevalent liver pathology named as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A comprehensive crosstalk of adiponectin and its cognate receptors, specifically adiponectin receptor- in the liver mediates ameliorative effects in -induced NAFLD by interaction with hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Recent studies highlight the implication of molecular mediators mainly involved in the pathogenesis of  and -driven NAFLD, however, the plausible mechanisms remain elusive. The present review aimed at collating the data regarding mechanistic approaches of adiponectin and adiponectin-activated PPARs as well as PPAR-induced adiponectin levels in attenuation of hepatic lipoinflammation.

Considering pre-existing medical conditions, comorbidities, and complications, modified fragility index (mFI) was calculated. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predicting variables of overall (G1-G4) and severe (G3-G4) complication rate.One hundred patients were surgically treated for endometrial cancer. Elevated mFI >3 was related to a statistically higher access rate to the high dependency unit (HDU) or intensive care unit (ITU) (33.3% vs 6.6%, P=0.013). Overall, 31% of women had postoperative complications. Using multivariate analysis, it was shown that undergoing laparotomy (odds ratio [OR] 7.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] .52-19.71; P<0.001) and having an mFI >3 (OR 7.19, 95% CI 1.43-36.25; P=0.021) were independent predictors of overall complications (G1-G4). Moreover, only smoking (OR 5.01, 95% CI 1.15-21.75; P=0.031) and mFI >3 (OR 5.16, 95% CI 1.07-24.94; P=0.047) were independent factors for severe complications (G3-G4).Modified fragility index was an important predictor of complications among patients treated for endometrial cancer and could be a useful tool for assisting clinicians in perioperative management.© 2019 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654177>Mechanisms underlying electro-mechanical dysfunction in the Zucker diabetic fatty rat heart: a model of  and type  diabetes.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major and worsening global health problem, currently affecting over 450 million people and reducing their quality of life.

The majority of diabetes mellitus (DM) patients belong to type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is highly associated with . The general principle of current therapeutic strategies for patients with T2DM mainly focuses on restoring cellular insulin response by potentiating the insulin-induced signaling pathway. In late-stage T2DM, impaired insulin production requires the patients to receive insulin replacement therapy for maintaining their glucose homeostasis. T2DM patients also demonstrate a drop of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in their circulation, which suggests that replenishing BDNF or enhancing its downstream signaling pathway may be beneficial. Because of their protein nature, recombinant insulin or BDNF possess several limitations that hinder their clinical application in T2DM treatment. Thus, developing orally active "insulin pill" or "BDNF pill" is essential to provide a more convenient and effective therapy. This article reviews the current development of non-peptidyl chemicals that mimic insulin or BDNF and their potential as anti-diabetic agents.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678099>Sexual Activity After Bariatric Surgery: A Prospective Monocentric Study Using the PISQ-IR Questionnaire.</a></h1><p> can lead to pelvic floor disorders, interfering with women's sexual life; Prolapse/Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire-International Urogynecology Association-Revised (PISQ-IR) is a new instrument to measure sexual life in women with pelvic floor disorders.To assess the utility of using PISQ-IR in morbidly obese women undergoing bariatric surgery and to show the improvement of bariatric surgery on sexuality.This prospective monocentric study included all women who underwent bariatric surgery from June 2016-May 2017. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was performed by 1 surgeon, and data were collected by 1 researcher. Demographics, medical history, number of deliveries, and type of bariatric surgery (SG or RYGB) were collected at baseline. At the 1-year follow-up consultation, postoperative complications, percentage of total body weight loss (TWL) and percentage excess weight loss were assessed. Questionnaires were given at baseline and at 1-year follow-up.Postoperative complications and total weight loss were measured at the 1-year follow-up. Sexual activity, using the PISQ-IR, and pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, and anal incontinence, using the urinary symptom profile and PFDI (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory) 20, were compared before surgery and at 1-year follow-up.72 patients were included at baseline, 54 (75%) were considered for final analysis (30 RYGB and 24 SG), and 51 patients were considered for PISQ-IR. The mean preoperative body mass index was 41 ± 5.4 kg/m, and mean age was 43 ± 11.8 years. Both procedures induced an important weight loss (mean TWL of 33%) and had a similar percentage of TWL for each procedure: 31 (15-46) for SG vs 34 (9-51) for RYGB. 9 patients (17 [6%]) became sexually active 1 year after surgery. For the sexually inactive population after 1 year, there was no differences in the PISQ-IR in the follow-up. When body mass index loss was >13 kg/m, a higher percentage of the sexually active population improved their different scores, and there were significant results for both global quality of life and desire (P = .026 and .046). The other questionnaires showed a significant decrease in urinary incontinence symptoms (P < .001) associated with weight loss, whereas there was no difference in terms of pelvic organ prolapse or anal incontinence.PISQ-IR is a useful instrument to measure sexual function regarding pelvic floor disorders.

Mammary tumorigenesis is severely linked to , one potential connection is leptin. Leptin is a hormone secreted by adipocytes, which contributes to the progression of breast cancer. Cell migration, metalloproteases secretion, and invasion are cellular processes associated with various stages of metastasis. These processes are regulated by the kinases FAK and Src. In this study, we utilized the breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 to determine the effect of leptin on FAK and Src kinases activation, cell migration, metalloprotease secretion, and invasion. We found that leptin activates FAK and Src, and induces the localization of FAK to the focal adhesions. Interestingly, leptin promotes the activation of FAK through a Src and STAT3-dependent canonical pathway. Specific inhibitors of FAK, Src and STAT3 showed that the effect exerted by leptin in cell migration in breast cancer cells is dependent on these proteins. Moreover, we established that leptin promotes the secretion of the extracellular matrix remodelers, MMP- and MMP-9 and invasion in a FAK and Src dependent manner. Our findings strongly suggest that leptin promotes the development of a more aggressive invasive phenotype in mammary cancer cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657154>Impact of a Real-World Lifestyle Intervention in an Entire Latin American City with More Than 50,000 People.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a real-world, citywide intervention on physical activity and eating habits in a Latin American city with more than 50,000 inhabitants.This was a plausibility assessment of a real-life intervention.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; ) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We measured the anesthetized Hoffmann's or H-reflex, the electrical analog of the muscle stretch reflex. Adult mice of both sexes were fed a control diet (CD; 10% kcal from fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal from fat) for 5, 10, or 15 weeks. We used three quantitative measures of H-reflex excitability: (1) H-reflex latency; () the percentage of motor neurons recruited from electrical stimulation of Group Ia muscle spindle afferents (H /M ); and (3) rate-dependent depression (RDD), the decrease in H-reflex amplitude to high frequency stimulation (20 stimuli at 5 Hz). A HFD did not significantly alter H latency (P = 0.16) or H /M ratios (P = 0.06), but RDD was significantly lower in HFD compared to CD groups (P < 0.001). Interestingly, HFD males exhibited decreased RDD compared to controls only after 5 and 10 weeks of feeding, but females showed progressive decreases in RDD that were only significant at 10 and 15 weeks on the HFD.

To evaluate the joint effects of long-term PM (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 1.0 μm) exposure and  on children's lung function, a cross-sectional sample of 6740 children (aged 7-14 years) was enrolled across seven northeastern Chinese cities from 2012 to 2013. Weight and lung function, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF), were measured according to standardized protocols. Average PM, PM, PM and nitrogen dioxide (NO) exposure levels were estimated using a spatiotemporal model, and sulphur dioxide (SO) and ozone (O) exposure were estimated using data from municipal air monitoring stations. Two-level logistic regression and general linear models were used to analyze the joint effects of body mass index (BMI) and air pollutants. The results showed that long-term air pollution exposure was associated with lung function impairment and there were significant interactions with BMI. Associations were stronger among obese and overweight than normal weight participants (the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for PM and lung function impairments in three increasing BMI categories were 1.50 (1.07-.11) to .55 (1.59-4.07) for FVC < 85% predicted, 1.44 (1.03-.01) to .51 (1.53-4.11) for FEV < 85% predicted, 1.34 (0.97-1.84) to .04 (1.24-3.35) for PEF < 75% predicted, and 1.34 (1.01-1.78) to 1.93 (1.26-.95) for MMEF < 75% predicted).

The percentage of weeks that incentive and control participants achieved a mean self-weighing of at least 6 times was 85.3% vs 75.8%, respectively (P = .002) in phase 1 and 37.7% vs 50.%, respectively (P = .009) in phase . Mean weight changes at the end of phase 1 were -1.1 (95% CI, -.1 to -0.1) kg in the incentive group and -1.9 (95% CI, -.9 to -0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.7 (95% CI, -0.7 to .) kg (P = .30 for comparison). At the end of phase , mean weight changes were 0.

Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is an indicator of overall body metabolism and may be a proxy for the impact of a specific metabolic profile on cancer risk. Therefore, we investigated the association of estimated BMR with incidence of 13 -related cancers in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Estimated BMR at baseline was calculated using the WHO/FAO/UNU equations and the relationships between BMR and cancer risk were investigated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. A total of 141,295 men and 317,613 women, with a mean follow-up of 14 years were included in the analysis. Overall, higher BMR was associated with a greater risk for most cancers that have been linked with . However, among normal weight participants, higher BMR was associated with elevated risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Hazard Ratio per 1-standard deviation change in BMR [HR ]: .46; 95%CI 1.20; 5.03), and distal colon cancer (HR : 1.33; 95%CI 1.001; 1.77) among men, and with proximal colon (HR : 1.16; 95%CI 1.01; 1.35), pancreatic (HR : 1.37; 95%CI 1.13; 1.66), thyroid (HR : 1.65; 95%CI 1.33; .05), postmenopausal breast (HR : 1.17; 95%CI 1.11; 1.22), and endometrial (HR : 1.20; 95%CI 1.03; 1.40) cancers in women. These results indicate that higher BMR may be an indicator of a metabolic phenotype associated with risk of certain cancer types, and may be a useful predictor of cancer risk independent of body fatness.

The mechanisms by which maternal  can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal metabolism are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational . The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational  and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal weight and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal . High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal  lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational  enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino acid transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational , focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.Copyright © 2019.

Food items collected through two 24-h recalls were classified according to the NOVA system. The contribution of each NOVA food group and their subgroups to total energy intake was determined by age group. Mean free sugar content in diet fractions made up exclusively of ultra-processed foods, or of processed foods, or of a combination of un/minimally processed foods and culinary ingredients (which includes table sugar and honey) were compared. Across quintiles of the energy contribution of ultra-processed foods, differences in the intake of free sugars, as well as in the prevalence of excessive free sugar intake (≥ 10% of total energy) were examined.Ultra-processed foods had the highest energy contribution among children, adolescents and adults in Australia, with older children and adolescents the highest consumers (53.1% and 54.3% of total energy, respectively). The diet fraction restricted to ultra-processed items contained significantly more free sugars than the two other diet fractions. Among all age groups, a positive and statistically significant linear association was found between quintiles of ultra-processed food consumption and both the average intake of free sugars and the prevalence of excessive free sugar intake.Ultra-processed food consumption drives excessive free sugar intake among all age groups in Australia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654259>Gut microbiota-derived succinate: Friend or foe in human metabolic diseases?</a></h1><p>There is now a wealth of evidence showing that communication between microbiota and the host is critical to sustain the vital functions of the healthy host, and disruptions of this homeostatic coexistence are known to be associated with a range of diseases including  and type  diabetes. Microbiota-derived metabolites act both as nutrients and as messenger molecules and can signal to distant organs in the body to shape host pathophysiology. In this review, we provide a new perspective on succinate as a gut microbiota-derived metabolite with a key role governing intestinal homeostasis and energy metabolism. Thus, succinate is not merely a major intermediary of the TCA traditionally considered as an extracellular danger signal in the host, but also a by-product of some bacteria and a primary cross-feeding metabolite between gut resident microbes. In addition to maintain a healthy microbiome, specific functions of microbiota-derived succinate in peripheral tissues regulating host nutrient metabolism should not be rule out. Indeed, recent research point to some probiotic interventions directed to modulate succinate levels in the intestinal lumen, as a new microbiota-based therapies to treat  and related co-morbidities. While further research is essential, a large body of evidence point to succinate as a new strategic mediator in the microbiota-host cross-talk, which might provide the basis for new therapeutically approaches in a near future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651309>A predictive model for non-completion of an intensive specialist  service in a public hospital: a case-control study.</a></h1><p>Despite the growing evidence base supporting intensive lifestyle and medical treatments for severe , patient engagement in specialist  services is difficult to achieve and poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to develop a model for predicting non-completion of a specialist multidisciplinary service for clinically severe , termed the Metabolic Rehabilitation Programme (MRP).Using a case-control study design in a public hospital setting, we extracted data from medical records for all eligible patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥35 kg/m with either type  diabetes or fatty liver disease referred to the MRP from 2010 through 2015. Non-completion status (case definition) was coded for patients whom started but dropped-out of the MRP within 12 months. Using multivariable logistic regression, we tested the following baseline predictors hypothesised in previous research: age, gender, BMI, waist circumference, residential distance from the clinic, blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), current continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, current depression/anxiety, diabetes status, and medications. We used receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve to test the performance of models.Out of the 219 eligible patient records, 78 (35.6%) non-completion cases were identified. Significant differences between non-completers versus completers were: age (47.1 versus 54.5 years, p < 0.001); residential distance from the clinic (21.8 versus 17.1 km, p = 0.018); obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) (42.9% versus 56.7%, p = 0.050) and CPAP therapy (11.7% versus 28.4%, p = 0.005). The probability of non-completion could be independently associated with age, residential distance, and either OSA or CPAP. There was no statistically significant difference in performance between the alternate models (69.5% versus 66.4%, p = 0.57).Non-completion of intensive specialist  management services is most common among younger patients, with fewer complex care needs, and those living further away from the clinic. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risk factors for dropping out early when managing outpatients with severe , whereas policy makers might consider strategies for increasing access to specialist  management services.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661341>Thinness, overweight, and  in indigenous school children and youth in Mexico.</a></h1><p> The prevalence of overweight (OWT) and  (OB), defined by the body mass index (BMI, kg/m) among children and youth has increased worldwide in the last 30-40 years. To evaluate the weight status, defined by the BMI, of indigenous school children and youth resident in different regions of Mexico Students 6-18 years (31,448 boys, 27,306 girls) were enrolled in bilingual schools for indigenous children and youth in Mexico in 2012. Height and weight were measured; the BMI was calculated. The BMI of each student was classified relative to International  Task Force (IOTF) age- and sex-specific criteria as thin (three grades), normal, overweight (OWT) or obese (OB). The sample was divided into five geographic regions for analysis: North, Central, South-Gulf, South-Pacific, and South-Southeast. Age- and sex-specific prevalence, 95% confidence intervals, and Chi-square tests were calculated. Prevalence of OWT + OB was highest in the South-Gulf, South-Pacific and South-Southeast regions and lowest in the North and Central regions, while thinness was most prevalent in the North and Central regions. Prevalence of severe and moderate thinness was relatively low, while the combined prevalence of OWT + OB was generally more prevalent in indigenous boys than girls.

In particular, protein malnutrition is one of the determinants of frailty and sarcopenia in elderly people.To investigate the role of amino acid supplementation in senior patients we performed an open-label randomized trial and administered a particular branched-chain amino acid enriched mixture (BCAAem) or provided diet advice in 155 elderly malnourished patients. They were followed for  months, assessing cognitive performance by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), muscle mass measured by anthropometry, strength measure by hand grip and performance measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the 30 s Chair Sit to Stand (30-s CST) test and the 4 m gait speed test. Moreover we measured oxidative stress in plasma and mitochondrial production of ATP and electron flux in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Both groups improved in nutritional status, general health and muscle mass, strength and performance; treatment with BCAAem supplementation was more effective than simple diet advice in increasing MMSE (1. increase versus 0., p = 0.0171), ATP production (0.43 increase versus -0.1, p = 0.0001), electron flux (0.50 increase versus 0.01, p < 0.0001) and in maintaining low oxidative stress. The amelioration of clinical parameters as MMSE, balance, four meter walking test were associated to increased mitochondrial function.Overall, our findings show that sustaining nutritional support might be clinically relevant in increasing physical performance in elderly malnourished patients and that the use of specific BCAAem might ameliorate also cognitive performance thanks to an amelioration of mitochondria bioenergetics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Night temperature is an important factor that influences the plug seedling quality. However, little research has focused on how the night temperature affects the growth and development of plug seedlings of these two medicinal species. In this study, uniform plug seedlings were cultivated in three environmentally controlled chambers for four weeks under three sets of day/night temperatures (25/10 °C, 25/15 °C, or 25/20 °C), the same relative humidity (75%), photoperiod (12 h), and light intensity (150 μmol·m·s PPFD) provided by white LEDs. The results showed that night temperature had a marked influence on the growth and development of both species. The night temperature of 15 °C notably enhanced the quality of plug seedlings evidenced by the increased shoot, root, and leaf dry weights, stem diameter, and Dickson's quality index. Moreover, a night temperature of 15 °C also stimulated and increased contents of primary and secondary metabolites, including soluble sugar, starch, total phenols and flavonoids. Furthermore, the 15 °C night temperature increased the chlorophyll content and stomatal conductance and decreased the hydrogen peroxide content.

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (.%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR .5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

However, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that an increase in dietary saturated fat could lead to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and heart rhythm by a NOX2 (NADPH oxidase )-dependent mechanism.We investigated this hypothesis by feeding mice high-fat diets. In vivo heart rhythm telemetry, optical mapping, and isolated cardiac myocyte imaging were used to quantify arrhythmias, repolarization, calcium transients, and intracellular calcium sparks.We found that saturated fat activates NOX (NADPH oxidase), whereas polyunsaturated fat does not. The high saturated fat diet increased repolarization heterogeneity and ventricular tachycardia inducibility in perfused hearts. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of NOX2 prevented arrhythmogenic abnormalities in vivo during high statured fat diet and resulted in less inducible ventricular tachycardia. High saturated fat diet activates CaMK (Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) in the heart, which contributes to abnormal calcium handling, promoting arrhythmia.We conclude that NOX2 deletion or pharmacological inhibition prevents the arrhythmogenic effects of a high saturated fat diet, in part mediated by activation of CaMK. This work reveals a molecular mechanism linking cardiac metabolism to arrhythmia and suggests that NOX2 inhibitors could be a novel therapy for heart rhythm abnormalities caused by cardiac lipid overload.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668562>Tobacco smoking and the risk of pancreatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.</a></h1><p>Tobacco smoking has been associated with increased risk of pancreatitis in several studies, however, not all studies have found an association and it is unclear whether there is a dose-response relationship between increasing amount of tobacco smoked and pancreatitis risk. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies on tobacco smoking and pancreatitis to clarify the association.PubMed and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies up to April 13th 2019. Prospective studies that reported adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between tobacco smoking and pancreatitis were included and summary RRs were calculated using a random effects model.Ten prospective studies were included. The summary RR for acute pancreatitis was 1.49 (95% CI: 1.29-1.72, I = 68%, n = 7) for current smokers, 1.24 (95% CI: 1.15-1.34, I = 0%, n = 7) for former smokers, and 1.39 (95% CI: 1.25-1.54, I = 69%, n = 7) for ever smokers compared to never smokers. Similar results were observed for chronic pancreatitis and acute/chronic pancreatitis combined. The summary RR per 10 cigarettes per day was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.18-1.42, I = 42%, n = 3) and per 10 pack-years in current smokers was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.08-1.17, I = 14%, n = 4) for acute pancreatitis and results were similar for chronic pancreatitis and acute/chronic pancreatitis combined.These results suggest that tobacco smoking increases the risk of acute and chronic pancreatitis and acute and chronic pancreatitis combined and that there is a dose-response relationship between increasing number of cigarettes and pack-years and pancreatitis risk.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC.

The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type  diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)-5-((benzo[d]thiazol--ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)--hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue.

NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC).  and type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C ω3 PUFA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669095>Shared Genetic and Experimental Links between -Related Traits and Asthma Subtypes in UK Biobank.</a></h1><p>Clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that  is associated with asthma and that these associations differ by asthma subtypes.

Experimental evidence to support the role of genes significantly associated with both -related traits and asthma via GWAS was sought using results from obese vs. lean mouse RNA-seq and RT-PCR experiments.We found a substantial positive genetic correlation between BMI and later-onset asthma defined by asthma age of onset at 16 years of age or older (Rg =0.25, P=9.56×10). Mendelian Randomization analysis provided strong evidence in support of BMI causally increasing the risk of asthma. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 34 shared loci among 3 -related traits and  asthma subtypes. GWAS functional analyses identified potential causal relationships between the shared loci and GTEx tissue eQTLs, shared immune- and cell differentiation-related pathways between  and asthma. Finally, RNA-seq data from lungs of obese versus control mice found that two genes (ACOXL and MYL6) from the cross-trait meta-analysis were differentially expressed, and these findings were validated by RT-PCR in an independent set of mice.Our work identified shared genetic components between -related traits and specific asthma subtypes, reinforcing the hypothesis that  causally increases the risk of asthma, and identifying molecular pathways that may underlie both  and asthma.Copyright © 2019.

The objective of the study was to verify the association between body mass index (BMI) and severity of CAD, its risk factors and surgical and percutaneous treatment in patients hospitalized in cardiological units.An ambispective, cross-sectional study was performed with patients older than 18 years attended by nutrition in the cardiology units, who underwent coronary angiography. The severity of CAD was categorized into two distinct classifications (CAD Class I and II), considering the presence of CAD as lesions ≥50% and ≥70%. The nutritional status of the patient was established based on BMI according to the World Health Organization (WHO) for the total sample and group of adults, and according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for the elderly. Age, gender, presence of associated comorbidities, history of smoking, and performed procedures were collected in patients' records. For statistical analysis Kruskal Wallis and Chi-square tests were used, and Hodges-Lehmann estimate was used for the median. Comparisons and associations were considered significant when p < 0.05.A total of 703 patients were included, of which 495 had arterial lesions ≥70% and 513 patients' lesions ≥50%. The average age was 61 years, women were older (63 vs 61; p = 0.008), had a higher BMI (28.16 kg/m vs 26.68 kg/m, p = 0.001) and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus (DM) (p < 0.001), dyslipidemia (DSLP) (p < 0.001), and hypertension (HTN) (p = 0.001). The majority of the sample consisted of men, who more often underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (53,9% vs 39%, p < 0.001), and were more likely to present more severe CAD (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003). In patients diagnosed with CAD the increase in BMI was positively associated with the presence of DM (p < 0.001), DSLP (p < 0.001) and HTN (p < 0.001), and negatively with age (p = 0.007). Patients with  III, were diagnosed with CAD, in average, 11 years earlier than patients with normal BMI (p = 0.05). Therefore, the higher the BMI, the lower the age at the moment of the examination in the total sample, and in the group of elderly, and this association was not found in adults. There was no significant association of BMI with the severity of CAD, or with PCI and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The greater severity of CAD was positively associated with the presence of DM (p = 0.012 and p = 0.001), HTN (p = 0.033 and p = 0.003) and older age (p = 0.005 and p = 0.015). Patients who underwent CABG had a higher incidence of and HTN (p = 0.003), DM (p = 0.006), whereas patients who had PCI had a lower incidence of HTN (p = 0.021) and DM (p = 0.004). was showed to be as an independent risk factor for the early incidence of CAD, which is strongly associated with the presence of comorbidities such as DM, HTN and DSLP. The greater severity of CAD and coronary interventions were associated with the presence of risk factors for CAD.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

In the current case-control study, an association between diagnosis of CRC,  and diabetes was investigated.Demographic characteristics, colonoscopy reports, history of drug, smoking, and medical history were collected from patients referred to a colonoscopy unit. The location, size and number of the polyps were recorded during the colonoscopy. Statistically, t-test was conducted for mean comparison for the groups. Pearson's chi-squared test (χ) was applied to categorize variables. Five classification methods based on the important clinicopathological characteristics such as age, BMI, diabetes, family history of colon cancer was performed to predict the results of colonoscopy.Overall, 693 patients participated in this study. In the present study, 115 and 515 patients were evaluated for adenoma/adenocarcinoma and normal colonoscopy, respectively. The mean age of patients positive for adenoma or adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than the negative groups (p value < 0.001). Incidence of overweight and/or  (BMI > 25 kg/m2) were significantly higher in adenoma positive patients as compared to controls (49.9 and 0.9% respectively, p value = 0.04).

Unadjusted and adjusted binary logistic regression models were used to study the correlates of the individual risk factors and their clustering. The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and overweight/ was 34.5%, 11.7%, and 52.9%, respectively. In total, 68.% of the participants had at least one risk factor and many participants had two risks in combination: 6.8% for 'hypertension and diabetes', 7.4% for 'diabetes and overweight/' and 21.4% for 'hypertension and overweight/'. In total, 4.7% had all three risk factors. Janajati ethnicity (1.4-.1 times), male gender (1.5 times) and family history of diabetes (1.4-3.4 times) were associated with presence of individual risk factors. Similarly, Janajati ethnicity (aOR: 4.31, 95% CI: .53-7.32), current smoking (aOR: 4.81, 95% CI: .27-10.21), and family history of diabetes (aOR: 4.60, 95% CI: .67-7.91) were associated with presence of all three risk factors.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genec susceptibility loci for  and T2DM, although the causal genes and mechanisms are largely unknown. SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body fat percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to insulin production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and insulin resistance.CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and lipid droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated lipid droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling pathways (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling pathways. Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) mRNA level was subsequently validated as significantly upregulated following SPRY2 KO, highlighting this as a potential mediator downstream of SPRY2.These findings suggest a role for SPRY2 in glucose and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and contribute to clarifying the function of this gene in the context of metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663036>Gendered Body Mass Index Percentile Charts and Transgender Youth: Making the Case to Change Charts.</a></h1><p>Body mass index (BMI) is defined as weight (kg)/height (m).

Enhancing DIT can lead to weight loss. Factors that increase DIT are expected to lower body mass index and body fat mass. Although various methods have been developed for measuring DIT in humans, there is currently no method available for calculating absolute DIT values in mice. Therefore, we attempted to measure DIT in mice by applying the method more commonly used for humans. Mouse energy metabolism was first measured under fasting conditions; EE was plotted against the square root of the activity count, and a linear regression equation was fit to the data. Then, energy metabolism was measured in mice that were allowed to feed ad libitum, and EE was plotted in the same way. We calculated the DIT by subtracting the predicted EE value from the fed EE value for the same activity count. The methodology for measuring DIT in mice may be helpful for researching ways of combatting  by increasing DIT. •The methodology for measuring absolute DIT values in mice is developed.•For mice, the proportion of DIT compared with calorie intake and EE are 12.3% and 21.7%, respectively.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657026>Psychological features in : A network analysis.</a></h1><p>Enhanced understanding of psychosocial factors associated with  may improve knowledge of their interplay mechanisms.

In contrast,  is one of the most strongly TZD-induced transcripts in human adipocytes, although not in cells from all individuals. Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +.5 kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human fat as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS.

At the vascular level, T presents genomic and non-genomic effects, and both effects may overlap. The genomic actions assume that androgens can freely cross the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to nuclear androgen receptors, inducing gene transcription and protein synthesis. The non-genomic effects have a more rapid onset and may be related to the interaction with protein/receptor/ion channels of the plasma membrane. The key T effect at the vascular level is vasorelaxation, which is primarily due to its rapid effect. Thus, the main purpose of this review is to discuss the T non-genomic effects at the vascular level and the molecular pathways involved in its vasodilator effect observed in in vivo and in vitro studies. In this sense, the nuclear receptor activation, the influence of vascular endothelium and the activation or inhibition of ion channels (potassium and calcium channels, respectively) will be reviewed regarding all the data that corroborated or not. Moreover, this review also provides a brief update on the association of T with the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, namely metabolic syndrome, type  diabetes mellitus, , atherosclerosis, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension. In summary, in this paper we consider the non-genomic vascular mode of action of androgen in physiological conditions and the main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Since high glucose levels are as toxic as lipids for hepatic metabolism, we hypothesize that altered response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to more severe NAFLD with significant/advanced liver damage.We studied 90 subjects with morbid  (73F/17M, BMI = 43. ± 5,9 kg/m) undergoing bariatric surgery and intraoperative liver biopsy, and measured HbA1c, HOMA-IR (fasting Glucose x Insulin/22.5), OGTT glucose and insulin profile, and calculated OGIS (muscle insulin sensitivity), hepatic-IR (glucose [AUC] x insulin [AUC]) during OGTT, insulin response as (insulin [dAUC]/glucose [dAUC] or Insulinogenic Index (IGI = (I-I)/(G-G)). Patients were divided in 3 groups according to liver biopsy: A (no-NAFLD, 23%), B (simple steatosis (SS), 53%) and C (NASH, 24%) with similar age, gender and BMI. Diabetes was 0% in no-NAFLD, 13% in SS, 35% in NASH. During OGTT, OGIS decreased from A to C (422 vs 360 vs 338, p < 0.01). Increased insulin concentrations, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and OGIS, not Hep-IR, were strongly associated to hepatic steatosis (p = 0.03, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 respectively).

T2DM is correlated with  and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy metabolism and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate  (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673384>Left ventricular global strains by linear measurements in three dimensions: interrelations and relations to age, gender and body size in the HUNT Study.</a></h1><p>Strain is a relative deformation and has three dimensions, in the left ventricle (LV) usually longitudinal (ε), transmural (ε) and circumferential (ε) strain.

In this observational study we aimed to study the relations of normal generic strains to age, body size and gender, as well as the interrelations between the three strain components.Generic strains derived from dimension measures by longitudinal and cross-sectional M-mode in all three dimensions were measured in 1266 individuals without heart disease from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study.The mean ε was -16.3%, ε was -22.7% and ε was 56.5%. Normal values by age and gender are provided. There was a gradient of ε from the endocardial, via the midwall to the external level, lowest at the external. All strains decreased in absolute values by increasing body surface area (BSA) and age, relations were strongest for ε. Gender differences were mainly a function of BSA differences. The three strain components were strongly interrelated through myocardial incompressibility.Global systolic strain is the total deformation of the myocardium; the three strain components are the spatial coordinates of this deformation, irrespective of the technology used for measurement. Normal values are method-dependent and not normative across methods. Interrelation of strains indicates a high degree of myocardial incompressibility and that longitudinal strain carries most of the total information.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Exclusion criteria included type I diabetes and previous pancreas transplantation. NODAT was defined as a new insulin requirement after KT. Delayed graft function was defined as need for dialysis within the first week after KT. Mean posttransplant follow-up period was 22 months.Forty-one patients underwent KT after LSG after median time of 16 months. Median age of postLSG patients undergoing KT was 56.0 years at time of KT. Average body mass index decreased by 9 from the time of LSG to KT, and no patients regained weight at 1-year follow-up. After LSG, the number of patients with hypertension (85.4% versus 48.5%) and the number of antihypertensive medications used decreased significantly (1.6 versus .6) at time of KT (P < .001 each). At 1-year follow-up, the improvement in hypertension persisted (51.% versus 48.5%, P = nonsignificant). The average insulin regimen decreased from 33.0 ± 51.6 to 11.7 ± 21.5 units at KT (P < .001).

Seven of these studies were included in the meta-analysis (280,672 women). Interpregnancy weight gain was consistently associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension and large-for-gestational age births. In contrast, interpregnancy weight loss was associated with a lower risk of delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate. The effect magnitude (relative risk) of interpregnancy weight gain on pregnancy induced hypertension or delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate was greater among women with a normal BMI in the index pregnancy compared to women with a starting BMI ≥25 kg/m.These findings confirm that interpregnancy weight change impacts the risk of developing perinatal complications in a subsequent pregnancy. This provides evidence in support of guidelines encouraging women to achieve post-partum weight loss, as their risk of perinatal complications might be minimised if they return to their pre-pregnancy weight before conceiving again.

However, in the last few years a new entity has emerged, the metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individual. This category encompasses obese individuals without the presence of metabolic diseases such as type  diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, or hypertension. Several studies have thus been undertaken to determine the risk of these MHO individuals for diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases compared with the 'unhealthy' obese. Data are still controversial on this matter, but one trend seems to be emerging: MHO is but a transient phase in the path toward insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Exogenous administration of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs have also been implicated in the modulation of cardiovascular functions. This brief review summarizes the role of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in vascular relaxation through the modulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). The effects of taurine on vascular health are controversial. However, in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors, it has been proposed that taurine can increase vascular NO levels by increasing eNOS expression, eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177, NO bioavailability, the level of antioxidative defense, and the l-arginine/NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio. The taurine-conjugated BA-mediated activation of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), G protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5) and/or muscarinic 3 receptor (M3) was also reported to increase vascular NO production. FXR activation increases eNOS expression and may reduce ADMA formation, while TGR5 increases mobilization of Ca and phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt in endothelial cells. Furthermore, taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs might regulate NO synthesis and activity by enhancing HS generation. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in reversing the endothelial dysfunction associated with diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, , malnutrition, and smoking. In addition, taurine-conjugated BAs have emerged as a potential treatment for portal hypertension. Despite these favorable findings, there is a need to further explore the mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the endothelial effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs. Here, we summarize the main findings regarding the effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs on the endothelial dysfunction associated with altered NO metabolism in cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Chronic stress and depression are highly associated with symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, but the molecular link is still not fully understood. Furthermore, therapies tackling these biological disorders are still lacking. The identification of shared molecular targets underlying both pathophysiologies may lead to the development of new treatments. The FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51) has recently been identified as a promising therapeutic target for stress-related psychiatric disorders and -related metabolic outcomes.The aim of this review is to summarize current evidence of in vitro, preclinical, and human studies on the stress responsive protein FKBP51, focusing on its newly discovered role in metabolism. Also, we highlight the therapeutic potential of FKBP51 as a new treatment target for symptoms of the metabolic syndrome.We conclude the review by emphasizing missing knowledge gaps that remain and future research opportunities needed to implement FKBP51 as a drug target for stress-related  or T2D.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Hence the study of biochemical markers is necessary for early diagnosis.Evaluate biomarkers to diagnose the risks of cardiovascular diseases in healthy Brazilian and African young adults.Weight, height, waist circumference, percentage of body fat and systemic blood pressure were measured; and fasting blood samples were taken for biochemical analysis. Triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-c, and apolipoproteins A-I and B were measured on automated equipment using commercially available kits, in addition to the tests of antioxidant capacity of HDL and the enzymatic activity of Paraoxonase 1.After statistical analysis, it was found that BMI, WC, fat (%), triglycerides, ApoB/ApoA-I ratio and Vmax were higher in Brazilians, while HDL-c, ApoA-I, Lag Time, Vmax and PON1 activity were higher in Africans. In Brazilians, the ApoB/ApoA-I ratio was related to  factors and lipid profile, but in Africans it was related only to lipids. The antioxidant capacity of HDL and PON1 activity was better in Africans. Through independence testing, we observed an association with moderate risk of myocardial infarction with gender in Africans. In the binary logistic regression analysis, it was found that men in general - and particularly African men - have higher risk of myocardial infarction than women; Odds Ratio ,144 (CI: 1,343-3,424) and ,281 (CI: 1,082-4,811), respectively.The anthropometric and biochemical parameters of Brazilians, especially men, predispose them to greater risks of cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, it was aimed to select the best incision management system to keep the incision edges together and prevent wound opening, and infection by protecting the incision. In this study, 60 patients who underwent abdominal surgery were evaluated regarding their risk of wound dehiscence. In our clinic, high-risk cases of abdominal surgery are performed, the risk factors being ischemia along the incision line, dirty and contaminated wound, , tension on the suture line, traumatization of the wound site, age at onset (> 65), body mass index (BMI) > 30, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), immunosuppressive drug users. A prospective study protocol was planned after ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status class assignment. Patients were divided into three groups: patients who underwent a postoperative negative-pressure therapy dressing, patients who underwent subcutaneous aspiration drainage, and patients who received standard dressing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the decompensation, surgical site infection, seroma, hospital stay and costs and to evaluate the results in the postoperative period. Sixty patients were randomized (n = 20, for each group). Thirty-one (51%) of the patients were male, and the mean age was 64.3 ± 8.9 (46-85). The mean BMI was 30.45 ± 7.. There was no statistically significant difference (p≥0.05) between groups in terms of sex, age, and BMI. The ASA score and surgical interventions were similar between the groups. Wound dehiscence rate was 25% (n = 8), 20% (n = 6) and 3% (n = 1) for the Standard Dressing (SD), Aspiration Drainage (AD) and Negative-Pressure (NP) groups, respectively (p <0.017). Duration of hospitalization was 16.45 ± 6.6, 14.3 ± 7.4 and 8.95 ± .8 days (p <0.001) for SD, AD and NP groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups regarding other variables (p≥0.05 for all variables). Negative-pressure wound treatment is an easy, fast and practical technique which reduces lateral tension and swelling.

PROK2 is also expressed in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) as an essential factor for neuro-and morphogenesis. Since the MOB was shown to be strongly involved in eating behavior, we hypothesized that PROK2 could be a new target in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis, through its effects in the MOB. We also asked whether PROK2 could be associated with the pathophysiology of , the metabolic syndrome (MetS), and type  diabetes (T2D) in humans.We assessed in wild type mice whether the expression of Prok2 in the MOB is dependent on the nutritional status. We measured the effect of human recombinant PROK2 (rPROK2) acute injection in the MOB on food intake and olfactory behavior. Then, using a lentivirus expressing Prok2-shRNA, we studied the effects of Prok2 underexpression in the MOB on feeding behavior and glucose metabolism. Metabolic parameters and meal pattern were determined using calorimetric cages. In vivo -deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed in mice after intraperitoneally insulin injection. Plasmatic PROK2 dosages and genetic associations studies were carried out respectively on 148 and more than 4000 participants from the D.E.S.I.R. (Data from an Epidemiologic Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome) cohort.Our findings showed that fasting in mice reduced Prok2 expression in the MOB. Acute injection of rPROK2 in the MOB significantly decreased food intake whereas Prok2-shRNA injection resulted in a higher dietary consumption characterized by increased feeding frequency and decreased meal size. Additionally, Prok2 underexpression in the MOB induced insulin resistance compared to scrambled shRNA-injected mice. In the human D.E.S.I.R. cohort, we found a significantly lower mean concentration of plasma PROK2 in people with T2D than in those with normoglycemia. Interestingly, this decrease was no longer significant when adjusted for Body Mass Index (BMI) or calorie intake, suggesting that the association between plasma PROK2 and diabetes is mediated, at least partly, by BMI and feeding behavior in humans. Moreover, common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in PROK2 gene were genotyped and associated with incident T2D or impaired fasting glycemia (IFG), MetS, and .Our data highlight PROK2 as a new target in the MOB that links olfaction with eating behavior and energy homeostasis.

School-based interventions hold great promise to combat the rising trend of childhood . This systematic review aimed to assess the overall effects of school-based  prevention interventions, and to investigate characteristics of intervention components that are potentially effective for preventing childhood .We systematically searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL and Embase databases to identify randomized- or cluster randomized- controlled trials of school-based  interventions published between 1990 and 2019. We conducted meta-analyses and subgroup analyses to determine the overall effects of  prevention programs and effect differences by various characteristics of intervention components on body mass index (BMI) or BMI Z-score of children.This systematic review included a total of 50 trials (reported by 56 publications). Significant differences were found between groups on BMI (- 0.14 kg/m (95% confidence interval: - 0.21, - 0.06)) and BMI Z-score (- 0.05 (- 0.10, - 0.01)) for single-component interventions; significant differences were also found between groups on BMI (- 0.32 (- 0.54, - 0.09) kg/m) and BMI Z-score (- 0.07 (- 0.14, - 0.001)) for multi-component interventions. Subgroup analyses consistently demonstrated that effects of single-component (physical activity) interventions including curricular sessions (- 0.30 (- 0.51, - 0.10) kg/m in BMI) were stronger than those without curricular sessions (- 0.04 (- 0.17, 0.09) kg/m in BMI); effects of single-component (physical activity) interventions were also strengthened if physical activity sessions emphasized participants' enjoyment (- 0.19 (- 0.33, - 0.05) kg/m in BMI for those emphasizing participants' enjoyment; - 0.004 (- 0.10, 0.09) kg/m in BMI for those not emphasizing participants' enjoyment). The current body of evidence did not find specific characteristics of intervention components that were consistently associated with improved efficacy for multi-component interventions (P > 0.05).School-based interventions are generally effective in reducing excessive weight gain of children. Our findings contribute to increased understandings of potentially effective intervention characteristics for single-component (physical activity) interventions. The impact of combined components on effectiveness of multi-component interventions should be the topic of further research.

However, the availability of public social media data has led to new ethical challenges about respecting user privacy and the appropriateness of monitoring social media for clinical trial recruitment. Researchers have voiced the need for involving users' perspectives in the development of ethical norms and regulations.This study examined the attitudes and level of concern among Twitter users and nonusers about using Twitter for monitoring social media users and their conversations to recruit potential clinical trial participants.We used two online methods for recruiting study participants: the open survey was (1) advertised on Twitter between May 23 and June 8, 2017, and () deployed on TurkPrime, a crowdsourcing data acquisition platform, between May 23 and June 8, 2017. Eligible participants were adults, 18 years of age or older, who lived in the United States. People with and without Twitter accounts were included in the study.While nearly half the respondents-on Twitter (94/603, 15.6%) and on TurkPrime (509/603, 84.4%)-indicated agreement that social media monitoring constitutes a form of eavesdropping that invades their privacy, over one-third disagreed and nearly 1 in 5 had no opinion. A chi-square test revealed a positive relationship between respondents' general privacy concern and their average concern about Internet research (P<.005). We found associations between respondents' Twitter literacy and their concerns about the ability for researchers to monitor their Twitter activity for clinical trial recruitment (P=.001) and whether they consider Twitter monitoring for clinical trial recruitment as eavesdropping (P<.001) and an invasion of privacy (P=.003). As Twitter literacy increased, so did people's concerns about researchers monitoring Twitter activity. Our data support the previously suggested use of the nonexceptionalist methodology for assessing social media in research, insofar as social media-based recruitment does not need to be considered exceptional and, for most, it is considered preferable to traditional in-person interventions at physical clinics. The expressed attitudes were highly contextual, depending on factors such as the type of disease or health topic (eg, HIV/AIDS vs  vs smoking), the entity or person monitoring users on Twitter, and the monitored information.The data and findings from this study contribute to the critical dialogue with the public about the use of social media in clinical research. The findings suggest that most users do not think that monitoring Twitter for clinical trial recruitment constitutes inappropriate surveillance or a violation of privacy. However, researchers should remain mindful that some participants might find social media monitoring problematic when connected with certain conditions or health topics. Further research should isolate factors that influence the level of concern among social media users across platforms and populations and inform the development of more clear and consistent guidelines.©Katja Reuter, Yifan Zhu, Praveen Angyan, NamQuyen Le, Akil A Merchant, Michael Zimmer.

Although excess leptin levels have been associated with vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease in the context of , the effects of chronic leptin treatment on vascular function remain unknown in CGL. Here, we hypothesized that leptin treatment will improve endothelial function via direct vascular mechanisms. We investigated the cardiovascular consequences of leptin deficiency and supplementation in male gBscl2 ( gene-deficient) mice-a mouse model of CGL. CGL mice exhibited reduced adipose mass and leptin levels, as well as impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Blood vessels from CGL mice had increased NADPH Oxidase 1 (Nox1) expression and reactive oxygen species production, and selective Nox1 inhibition restored endothelial function. Remarkably, chronic and acute leptin supplementation restored endothelial function via a PPARγ-dependent mechanism that decreased Nox1 expression and reactive oxygen species production. Selective ablation of leptin receptors in endothelial cells promoted endothelial dysfunction, which was restored by Nox1 inhibition. Lastly, we confirmed in aortic tissue from older patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery that acute leptin can promote signaling in human blood vessels. In conclusion, in gBscl2 mice, leptin restores endothelial function via peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma-dependent decreases in Nox1. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that vessels from aged patients remain leptin sensitive. These data reveal a new direct role of leptin receptors in the control of vascular homeostasis and present leptin as a potential therapy for the treatment of vascular disease associated with low leptin levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665931>Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and nutritional status are clinically useful in predicting prognosis in colorectal cancer patients.</a></h1><p>: Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and nutritional status may provide a prognostic value in colorectal cancer (CRC).

Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and non-HDL-C levels of the four groups were compared.HDL-C levels of group 4 were the highest (=0.03), and TG and non-HDL-C levels of group 1 were the highest (=0.04, 0.016, respectively) in all groups. There was no significant difference between serum parathormone, calcium, and phosphorus levels of the four groups (=0.778, 0.121, 0.184, respectively). In unadjusted analysis, 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were found to be correlated negatively with BMI (=0.0005), LDL-C (=0.01), and non-HDL-C (=0.003) and correlated positively with HDL-C levels (=0.006). After adjustments for age, sex, BMI, and log parathormone levels were made, no correlation was found between 25-hydroxy vitamin D and lipid (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG) levels (=0.91, 0.06, 0.95, 0.79, respectively).There may be an association between vitamin D insufficiency and dyslipidemia.

We excluded those women with pre-existing type  diabetes, those with missing data, and those with unlikely data. GDM was defined as fasting glucose levels >5.55 mmol/L [>100 mg/dL] or >7.77 mmol/L [>140 mg/dL] two hours after glucose load in the oral glucose tolerance test. Potential predictors were selected based on prior research and ease of evaluation.From the original database of 100 758 records, 86 362 women were included in the final cohort. The mean GDM prevalence was 7.6% (95%CI [confidence interval] 7.5%-7.8%), increasing from 4.4% (95% CI 4.0%-4.9%) in 2002 to 13.0% (95% CI 12.0%-13.9%) in 2015. Age, education, marital status, parity, family history of type  diabetes, personal history of GDM, hypertension and pre-eclampsia, alcohol consumption, smoking, and pre-gestational nutritional status performed well in the prediction of GDM.One out of eight Chilean pregnant women of medium- to low socio-economic status were found to develop GDM. We identified a set of easy-to-capture predictors in the primary health care system that may allow for the early identification of women at high risk for the development of GDM.© 2019 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656490>An audit of surgical site infection following open prostatectomy in a Nigerian Teaching Hospital.</a></h1><p>Surgical site infections (SSI) are a potential cause of morbidity and increased cost of care after operations such as open prostatectomy.To audit the occurrence of SSI after open prostatectomy at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, Nigeria.A review of all patients who underwent open prostatectomy over a ten-year period (July 2005 to June 2015). Data analysis was done using the statistical package for social sciences version 21. Association between variables was determined using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 247 open prostatectomy surgeries were reviewed, with the patients' ages ranging from 43 - 91 years and a mean age of 67.0 ± 8.8 years. Elective procedures were 98.8% while the remaining 1.% were emergency cases. There were 24 (9.8%) surgical site infections. The duration of admission of the patients with SSI ranged from 6 - 15 days with a mean of 9.5 ± 3. days, as against 4 - 9 days (mean of 5.0 ± .1days) for those without SSI. All the patients with SSI were successfully managed with no resultant mortality. Risk factors identified for SSI were emergency surgery (p=0.001),  (p<0.0001), diabetes mellitus (p=0.008), smoking (p<0.0001), pre-operative catheterization (p<0.0001), excessive haemorrhage (p<0.0001) and post-operative suprapubic bladder drainage (p<0.0001).SSI is a recognized complication of open prostatectomy. Identified risk factors for its occurrence from this audit are emergency operation, , diabetes mellitus, smoking, pre-operative catheterization, excessive haemorrhage and post-operative suprapubic bladder drainage. Age, approach to prostatectomy (retropubic vs transvesical), incision type (lower midline vs pfannenstiel), level of the surgeon, catheter type and modality of irrigation were however not significant risk factors for post-prostatectomy SSI in this study.© 2019 Salako et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653517>Preclinical vascular alterations in obese adolescents detected by Laser-Doppler Flowmetry technique.</a></h1><p>Childhood  promotes adverse changes in cardiovascular structure and function. This study evaluated whether alterations in skin microcirculation were already present in obese adolescents in a pre-clinical phase of cardiovascular disease.After an overnight fasting 22 obese adolescents and 24 normal-weight controls of similar age and gender distribution underwent clinical and blood examination and assessment of microvascular function by using two non-invasive techniques such as Peripheral Artery Tonometry (PAT) and Laser-Doppler Flowmetry (LDF). As compared to normal weight subjects, obese children had higher blood pressure, were significantly more hyper-insulinemic and insulin resistant, showing significantly higher plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). LDF showed lower pre- and post-occlusion forearm skin perfusion (perfusion units/second (PU/sec); median [IQR]) in obese than in normal weight subjects (pre-occlusion: 1633.8 [1023.5] vs. 2281.1 [1344.]; p = 0.015. Post-occlusion: 4811.3 [4068.9] vs. 7072.8 [7298.8]; p = 0.021), while PAT revealed similar values of reactive hyperemia index (RHI). In entire population, fat mass % (FM%) was an independent determinant of both pre-and post-occlusion skin perfusion. Finally, being obese was associated with a higher risk to have a reduction of both pre- and post-occlusion skin perfusion (OR = 5,82 and 9,27, respectively).LDF showed very early, pre-clinical, vascular involvement in obese adolescents, characterized by impaired skin microcirculation, possibly reflecting a more diffuse microvascular dysfunction to other body tissues. Whether changing life style and improving weight may reverse such pre-clinical alterations remains to be established.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Details of demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cutaneous markers were collected for both the groups.Prevalence of hypertension (30.3 vs. 13.6%),  (28.8 vs. 12.%), hair thinning (36.3 vs. 14.6%), premature graying (49.6 vs. 29.9%), AGA (49.1 vs. 27.4%), and lipid abnormalities (total cholesterol - 16.7 vs. 8.8%; low-density lipoprotein - 7.3 vs. .%; and high-density lipoprotein - 92.5 vs. 88.7%) were higher in cases as compared with control. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that AGA [5.619, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.025-7.845, <0.0001] is the strongest predictor of CAD among young Asian male individuals, closely followed by premature graying (5.267, 95% CI: 3.716-7.466, <0.0001),  (4.133, 95% CI: .839-6.018, <0.0001), and hair thinning (3.36, 95% CI: .452-4.621, <0.0001). SYNTAX score, left ventricle ejection fraction, and degree of disease severity were also found to be independent associates of premature graying and AGA.Our findings support the hypothesis that cutaneous markers are independently associated with underlying CAD irrespective of other classical cardiovascular risk factors. This, in combination with classical markers, could be effectively used for early identification and risk stratification of young patients with occult or established CAD.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against  and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the long-term effects of SG on T2DM remission with remission seen after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or gastric banding (GB).A literature search was performed in PubMed and Cochrane Library using the following search terms: 'sleeve gastrectomy', 'diabetes', 'gastric bypass' and 'gastric banding'. Studies published between January 2000 and April 2018, and with following inclusion criteria were selected for this review: BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2, age ≥ 18 years, follow-up ≥ 1 year, T2DM. Data was statistically analysed using a random-effects model and results were expressed as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval.After exclusion, 35 out of an initial 748 studies, consisting of 18 138 T2DM patients, remained for inclusion. Of these patients, 2480 underwent a SG. The remaining patients underwent a RYGB (n = 10,597) or GB (n = 5061). One year postoperatively, SG patients reached significantly (OR 0.71, p = 0.003) less T2DM remission than RYGB. After stratifying for different criteria for remission, RYGB still tended to result in higher remission rates, but the difference was not statistically significant. Beyond 1 year of follow-up, the difference between RYGB and SG in terms of T2DM remission decreased. SG was superior to the GB (OR .17, p = 0.001) after 1 year of follow-up.This review demonstrates important remission of T2DM following SG. Nevertheless, as remission was significantly more often observed following RYGB surgery, the latter procedure remains the gold standard for reaching T2DM remission in patients with concurrent .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655012>Hypocretin/orexin modulates body weight and the metabolism of glucose and insulin.</a></h1><p>The hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt/orexin) unit affects the functions of several organ systems including the nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and the reproductive systems. This review examines the tissue distribution of the hcrt/orexin system and the variety of biological activities attributed to it. Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to , and insulin and glucose metabolism. Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin  receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein  and glucagon. Literature reports show that hcrt/orexin can significantly increase insulin secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreata. Moreover, several studies reported that the tissue expression of glucose transporter type 4 is markedly higher after treatment with orexin. Hcrt/orexin also decreases blood glucose concentration and reduces insulin resistance. It reduces  by increasing browning of fat cells and energy expenditure. Taken together, hcrt/orexin modulates  and the metabolism of glucose and insulin.

Evidence has shown considerable interpersonal variation of changes in BP among people experiencing weight loss, and such variation might be partly determined by genetic factors. We assessed the changes in systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) among 692 participants randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets varying in macronutrient content for  years. Two separate polygenic scores (SBP/DBP-PGS derived from 52/50 single nucleotide polymorphisms) were built for each participant based on 66 BP-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. During a -year intervention, participants in the bottom versus upper tertile of SBP/DBP-PGS had a greater decrease in SBP (△SBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.84 versus -1.61, -4.76 versus -.75, -.49 versus -1.63; =0.001) or in DBP (△DBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.09 versus -1.34, -.69 versus -1.44, -1.82 versus -0.53; <0.001). We also found gene-diet interaction on changes in SBP from baseline to 24 months (=0.009). Among participants assigned to a high-protein diet, those with a lower SBP-polygenic scores had greater decreases in SBP at months 6 (=0.018), months 12 (=0.007), and months 24 (=0.089); while no significant difference was observed across the SBP-polygenic scores tertile groups among those assigned to an average-protein diet (all  values >0.05).

This insufficiency is mostly post-ischaemic in nature, but other aetiologies are possible in this high-risk population. In patients with DT2, diabetic cardiomyopathy is a recognized cause of cardiac insufficiency secondary to chronic hyperglycaemia and myocardial lipotoxicity, which promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (and, frequently, apoptosis of these cells), interstitial fibrosis and a decrease in myocardial contractile performance. Several studies have shown that diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with modifications to the intestinal microbiota, and changes in the synthesis of bacterial metabolites and their diffusion into the host, some of which appear to have direct deleterious effects on cardiac contractility. These findings open up new perspectives for pathophysiological studies by establishing the presence of a 'microbiota-myocardium' axis and raising the possibility of innovative new treatments. Correction of intestinal dysbiosis in patients with cardiac insufficiency could, therefore, constitute an innovative therapeutic approach to cases of this disease with a poor prognosis.Copyright © 2019.

Studies suggest that similar fat accumulation in a given population might result in different levels of dyslipidemia risk among individuals; for example, despite similar or leaner body composition compared with Caucasians, Asians of Korean descent experience a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia. These variations imply a possible role of gene- interactions on lipid profiles. Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 500 loci regulating plasma lipids, but the interaction structure between genes and  traits remains unclear. We hypothesized that some loci modify the effects of  on dyslipidemia risk and analyzed extensive gene-environment interactions (GxEs) at genome-wide levels to search for replicated gene- interactive single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In four Korean cohorts (n=18,025), we identified and replicated 20 gene- interactions, including novel variants ( and ) and known lipid-associated variants (, , , and ). When we estimated the additional heritability of dyslipidemia by considering GxEs, the gain was substantial for triglycerides (TGs) but mild for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (Total-C); the interaction explained up to 18.7% of TG, .4% of LDL-C, and 1.9% of Total-C heritability associated with waist-hip ratio. Our findings suggest that some individuals are prone to develop abnormal lipid profiles, particularly with regard to TGs, even with slight increases in  indices; ethnic diversities in the risk alleles might partly explain the differential dyslipidemia risk between populations. Research about these interacting variables may facilitate knowledge-based approaches to personalize health guidelines according to individual genetic profiles.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657604>[Twenty-five years of duodenal switch.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type  diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human , and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in , reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5--fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in  and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Data were analyzed from July to August 2018 and in April 2019.The bariatric surgical procedures (n = 2498) included in this study were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (1842 [73.7%]), sleeve gastrectomy (381 [15.3%]), adjustable gastric banding (249 [10.0%]), and other procedures (26 [1.0%]).The study measured total, outpatient, inpatient, and outpatient pharmacy expenditures from 3 years before surgery to 10 years after surgery, excluding expenditures associated with the initial bariatric surgical procedure.Among 9954 veterans with severe , 7387 (74.%) were men; the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (8.8) years for the surgery cohort and 52.5 (8.7) years for the nonsurgery cohort. Mean total expenditures for the surgery cohort were $5093 (95% CI, $4811-$5391) at 7 to 12 months before surgery, which increased to $7448 (95% CI, $6989-$7936) at 6 months after surgery. Postsurgical expenditures decreased to $6692 (95% CI, $6197-$7226) at 5 years after surgery, followed by a gradual increase to $8495 (95% CI, $7609-$9484) at 10 years after surgery. Total expenditures were higher in the surgery cohort than in the nonsurgery cohort during the 3 years before surgery and in the first  years after surgery. The expenditures of the  cohorts converged 5 to 10 years after surgery. Outpatient pharmacy expenditures were significantly lower among the surgery cohort in all years of follow-up ($509 lower at 3 years before surgery and $461 lower at 7 to 12 months before surgery), but these cost reductions were offset by higher inpatient and outpatient (nonpharmacy) expenditures.In this cohort study of 9954 predominantly older male veterans with severe , total health care expenditures increased immediately after patients underwent bariatric surgery but converged with those of patients who had not undergone surgery at 10 years after surgery. This finding suggests that the value of bariatric surgery lies primarily in its associations with improvements in health and not in its potential to decrease health care costs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654282>Multimodal non-invasive monitoring to apply an open lung approach strategy in morbidly obese patients during bariatric surgery.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the use of non-invasive variables for monitoring an open-lung approach (OLA) strategy in bariatric surgery. Twelve morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery received a baseline protective ventilation with 8 cmHO of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP). Then, the OLA strategy was applied consisting in lung recruitment followed by a decremental PEEP trial, from 20 to 8 cmHO, in steps of  cmHO to find the lung's closing pressure. Baseline ventilation was then resumed setting open lung PEEP (OL-PEEP) at  cmHO above this pressure. The multimodal non-invasive variables used for monitoring OLA consisted in pulse oximetry (SpO), respiratory compliance (Crs), end-expiratory lung volume measured by a capnodynamic method (EELV), and esophageal manometry. OL-PEEP was detected at 15.9 ± 1.7 cmHO corresponding to a positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (P) of 0.9 ± 1.1 cmHO. ROC analysis showed that SpO was more accurate (AUC 0.92, IC95% 0.87-0.97) than Crs (AUC 0.76, IC95% 0.87-0.97) and EELV (AUC 0.73, IC95% 0.64-0.82) to detect the lung's closing pressure according to the change of P from positive to negative values. Compared to baseline ventilation with 8 cmHO of PEEP, OLA increased EELV (1309 ± 517 vs. 2177 ± 679 mL) and decreased driving pressure (18.3 ± . vs. 10.1 ± 1.7 cmHO), estimated shunt (17.7 ± 3.4 vs. 4. ± 1.4%), lung strain (0.39 ± 0.07 vs. 0.22 ± 0.06) and lung elastance (28.4 ± 5.8 vs. 15.3 ± 4.3 cmHO/L), respectively; all p < 0.0001. The OLA strategy can be monitored using noninvasive variables during bariatric surgery. This strategy decreased lung strain, elastance and driving pressure compared with standard protective ventilatory settings.Clinical trial number NTC03694665.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677301>The association between family history of diabetes mellitus and offspring long- term neurological hospitalization.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to determine whether being born to non-diabetic mother with a family history of diabetes mellitus (DM), is associated with higher rates of long-term neurological hospitalizations of the offspring.A retrospective analysis of all live births and pediatric hospitalizations at Soroka University Medical Center between 1991-2014 was performed. Family history of DM was collected from prepartum women using anamnesis. During the study period 208,728 deliveries met the inclusion criteria, of them 8.% (n=17040) were of non-diabetic mothers with family history of DM. Rates of neurological hospitalization with or without family history were analyzed.Offspring born to non-diabetic mothers with family history of DM had higher rates of neurological hospitalizations. The cumulative incidence of long-term neurological hospitalizations was higher as compared with those without family history of DM (log-rank test P=0.007). Neurological hospitalizations was higher by 13% in the study group, after controlling for confounders such as maternal age, maternal , hypertensive disorders, birth weight and cesarean delivery. (adjusted odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.23) CONCLUSION: Being born to a non-diabetic mother with a family history of DM is independently associated with higher long-term neurological hospitalizations of the offspring.© 2019 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in diet and physical activity, which are secondary outcomes of a community-based, multilevel cardiovascular disease risk reduction intervention designed for women in rural communities.Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities was a six-month, community-randomized trial conducted in 16 rural towns in Montana and New York, USA. Sedentary women aged 40 and older with overweight and  were recruited. Intervention participants (eight towns) attended twice weekly exercise and nutrition classes for 24 weeks (48 total). Individual-level components included aerobic exercise, progressive strength training, and healthy eating practices; a civic engagement component was designed to address social and built environment factors to support healthy lifestyles. The control group (eight towns) attended didactic healthy lifestyle classes monthly (six total). Dietary and physical activity data were collected at baseline and post-intervention. Dietary data were collected using automated self-administered 24-h dietary recalls, and physical activity data were collected by accelerometry and self-report. Data were analyzed using multilevel linear regression models with town as a random effect.At baseline, both groups fell short of meeting many recommendations for cardiovascular health. Compared to the control group, the intervention group realized significant improvements in intake of fruit and vegetables combined (difference: 0.6 cup equivalents per day, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.1, p = .026) and in vegetables alone (difference: 0.3 cup equivalents per day, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6, p = .016). For physical activity, there were no statistically significant between-group differences based on accelerometry. By self-report, the intervention group experienced a greater increase in walking MET minutes per week (difference: 113.5 MET-minutes per week, 95% CI 12.8 to 214., p = .027).Between-group differences in dietary and physical activity behaviors measured in this study were minimal. Future studies should consider how to bolster behavioral outcomes in rural settings and may also continue to explore the value of components designed to enact social and environmental change.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: .

Network capital was calculated via a position generator, common in egocentric network surveys. Body mass index was calculated with self-reported height and weight.Multilevel linear regression models were used to examine the association between neighborhood and network capital and  among respondents within sampling chains.Higher household income was associated with greater neighborhood capital, whereas higher educational attainment was associated with greater network capital. Social cohesion was negatively associated with BMI ( = -1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -.39 to -0.11); network diversity was positively associated with BMI ( = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.55).The findings shed light on how social capital may be patterned by socioeconomic status and, further, how distinct forms of capital may be differentially associated with health among black Americans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659836>Operative risk stratification in the obese female undergoing implant-based breast reconstruction.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of  is growing, and breast reconstruction in the obese patient is becoming the norm rather than the exception. Our aim was to evaluate implant reconstruction outcomes in the obese female in the presence of coincident surgical risk factors and identify potential risk-reducing interventions. A review of consecutive obese women (BMI ≥ 30) who underwent mastectomy and implant breast reconstruction was performed. Patient demographics, comorbidities, oncologic treatments, and reconstructive procedures and their complications were recorded. A total of 151 women (242 breast reconstructions) were included with mean follow-up of 28 months. Average BMI was 36. Eighty percent of cases were immediate and 20% delayed. ADMs were utilized in 58% of cases. About 25% of patients had diabetes with one-third achieving perioperative glycemic control. About 18% of women were active smokers, and 33% had radiotherapy. Major and minor complications occurred in 42% and 11% of patients, respectively. About 24% of reconstructed breasts required implant removal. Obese patients with prior radiation were three times as likely to develop infection (P = 0.008) and .5× as likely to undergo explantation (P = 0.002). Skin flap necrosis was three times as likely in obese smokers (P = 0.01). Increased rates of wound breakdown were identified in obese patients with increasing age (P = 0.005), smoking (P = 0.0035), and radiation (P = 0.023). In the obese radiated and smoking patient subgroups, surgical modifications (use of autologous tissue, delayed breast reconstruction timing, and no ADM) were associated with reduction in the relative risk for implant complications. While  alone increases implant breast reconstruction complication rates, the presence of additional risk factors compounds these rates. The use of surgical modifications may reduce the occurrence of perioperative complications in the obese female with coincident surgical risk factors undergoing implant breast reconstruction.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670297>Predictors of  hypoventilation syndrome among patients with sleep-disordered breathing in India.</a></h1><p>No study has been done in India to evaluate  hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) among patients with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The known predictors of OHS, i.e., body mass index (BMI) >35 kg/m and forced vital capacity (FVC) <3.5 L for men and <.3 L for women from western countries, cannot be applied to Indian patients.To find out the prevalence of OHS and to determine the predictors of OHS among Indian SDB patients.It was a retrospective observational study conducted in a tertiary care institute from September 1, 2017, to August 31, 2018. All the patients who underwent polysomnography were analyzed for the presence of OHS. Of 85 patients referred for polysomnography, 76 had SDB. Thirteen patients were excluded because of hypoventilation due to other known causes or could not perform spirometry.The prevalence of OHS among SDB after excluding the other causes of hypoventilation was 15.87% (10/63). The predictors were determined using univariate analysis between daytime partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO) and other predictors. PaCO significantly correlated with minimum nocturnal oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO), FVC %predicted, BMI, daytime SpO, forced expiratory volume %predicted, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO). Following a stepwise multiple regression, minimum nocturnal SpO, FVC %predicted, and BMI were found to be independent predictors of OHS. A minimum nocturnal SpO threshold of 60%, FVC %predicted <74.5%, BMI >30.95 kg/m, and absolute FVC <.33 L for men and <1.68 L for women were found to be predictors of OHS.The prevalence of OHS in Indian patients is similar to Caucasians.

College-level data on LGB context were primarily collected through college websites. Multinomial logistic regression models were fit to examine associations between LGB college climate scores (including non-discrimination policies, presence of LGB or diversity-related student groups, LGB courses offered, LGB housing accommodations, and prevalence of LGB students) and students' weight status (underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obese), based on self-reported height and weight. Higher LGB climate scores (i.e., more supportive environments) were associated with lower risk of overweight and  among all students. Sexual orientation-stratified findings among female students suggested that the association between LGB climate scores and weight status was similar to the overall female sample. Sexual orientation-stratified findings among male students showed a more complex relationship between LGB climate scores and weight status.

Patients of Met S were recruited from the Endocrinology and Diabetic Clinic of Sheikh Zayed Hospital Lahore, over the time span of 6 months from July to December 2016. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ADRB3 was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism and of LXR-α by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. The frequency of TT variant of ADRB3 T>C in Met S was 69 (34.5%) and in controls 89 (44.5%), frequency of TC 103 (51.5%) and 96 (48%), and of CC 28 (14%) and 15 (7.5%), respectively. In the recessive model (CC: TT + TC), CC genotype was found to be associated with the increased risk of Met S (P = 0.027; odds ratio [OR] = .09; confidence interval [CI] =1.08-4.03) and the association remained significant after controlling for the confounders such as age and sex.

We sought to examine the associations between prenatal dog or cat keeping with caregiver-reported ADHD in preadolescents in the Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study (WHEALS) birth cohort (N = 1258).At an interview with the caregiver at child age 10-12 years, caregivers reported if the WHEALS child had ever been diagnosed with ADHD. Similarly, during an interview with the mother prenatally, pet keeping (defined as dog or cat kept inside ≥1 h/day) was ascertained. Logistic regression models were fit to examine the association of prenatal pet keeping (dog keeping and cat keeping, separately) with ADHD.A subset of 627 children were included in the analyses: 93 who had ADHD and 534 with neurotypical development. After accounting for confounders and loss to follow-up, maternal prenatal dog exposure was associated with .23 times (95% CI: 1.15, 4.31; p = 0.017) greater odds of ADHD among boys.

A random sample of Swedish men from the general population, born in 1943 ( = 798) were followed for 21 years. Data on clinical characteristics and laboratory values were collected in 1993. An echocardiography was performed in 2014. We used logistic regression to examine the association between baseline data and the outcome. . Echocardiography was performed in 535 men, and aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis was diagnosed in 27 (5.0%). 14 persons developed aortic stenosis (.6%). Among men with aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis, 29.6% were obese. In multivariable stepwise regression model, body mass index (odds ratio per unit increase 1.23 (95% CI 1.10-1.38;  = .0003)) and hypercholesterolemia, combined with high sensitive C-reactive protein (odds ratio versus all other .66 (1.18-6.00;  = .019)) were significantly associated with increased risk of developing aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis. Body mass index was the only factor significantly associated with a higher risk of developing aortic stenosis. . The prevalence of either aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis was 5% and of aortic stenosis .6%.  and hypercholesterolemia combined with elevated high sensitive C-reactive protein at the age of 50 predicted the development of degenerative aortic sclerosis or stenosis, whilst only  was correlated with the occurrence of aortic stenosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671360>Inter-correlated gut microbiota and SCFAs changes upon antibiotics exposure links with rapid body-mass gain in weaned piglet model.</a></h1><p>The risk of overweight or  in association with early exposure of antibiotics remains an important public issue for health-care of children. Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal microbiota were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, -methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic microbiota to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, disproportionally changing body mass index (BMI) distributions pose particular challenges. Flexible modeling of the shape of BMI distributions may improve prediction performance.We used data from repeated national health surveys conducted in Mexico, Colombia and Peru at four or five time points between 1988 and 2014. Data from all surveys except the last survey were used to construct prediction models for three  indicators (median BMI, overweight/ prevalence and  prevalence) for the time of the last survey. We assessed their performance using predicted curves, absolute prediction errors and comparison of actual and predicted distributions. With one method, we modeled the shape of BMI distributions assuming BMI follows a Box-Cox Power Exponential (BCPE) distribution, whose parameters were modeled as a function of interval or nominal 5-year age groups, time and their interaction terms. In a second method, we modeled each of the  indicators directly as a function of the same covariates using quantile and logistic regression.The BCPE model with interval age groups yielded the best prediction performance in predicting  prevalence. Average absolute prediction errors across all age groups were 4.3 percentage points (95% percentile interval: 1.9, 7.5), .5 (1., 6.1) and 1.7 (1.0, 9.3), with data from Mexico, Colombia and Peru, respectively. This superiority was weak or none for overweight/ prevalence and median BMI.The BCPE model performed better for prediction of the extremes of BMI distribution, possibly by incorporating its shape more precisely.© The Author(s) 2019; all rights reserved.

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity measures in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal-weight (77%) -6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (p < 0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (p > 0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal-weight population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of body fat in preschoolers. The role of vigorous PA in the prevention of early childhood  should be further investigated in future studies.ISRCTN ISRCTN41045021 .

Early screening and prevention of  is critical for averting associated morbidity, disability, and mortality. Ethiopia has been using the international (WHO's) BMI cut-off for diagnosing  even though its validity among Ethiopian population was questioned. To address this problem, a new body mass index cut-off was developed for Ethiopian adults using population-specific data. However, its performance in diagnosing  has not been validated. Therefore, this study determined the performance of the newly developed Ethiopian and World Health Organization (WHO) BMI cut-offs in detecting  among Ethiopian adults.A cross-sectional study was carried out among 704 employees of Jimma University from February to April 2015. The study participants were selected using simple random sampling technique based on their payroll. Data on sociodemographic variables were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Anthropometric parameters including body weight and height were measured according to WHO recommendation. Body fat percentage (BF%) was measured using the air displacement plethysmography (ADP) after calibration of the machine. The diagnostic accuracy of the WHO BMI cut-off (≥ 30 kg/m) for  in both sexes and Ethiopian BMI cut-off (> 22. kg/m for males and >  24.5 kg/m for females) were compared to  diagnosed using ADP measured body fat percentage (> 35% for females and >  25% for males). Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and kappa agreements were determined to validate the performance of the BMI cut-offs.In males, WHO BMI cut-off has a sensitivity of 5.3% and specificity of 99.4% (Kappa = 0.047) indicating a slight agreement. However, the Ethiopian cut-off showed a sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 87.7% (Kappa = 0.752) indicating a substantial agreement. Similarly, in females, the WHO BMI cut-off showed a sensitivity of 46.9%, while its specificity was 100% (Kappa = 0.219) showing a fair agreement. The Ethiopian BMI cut-off demonstrated a sensitivity 80.0% and a specificity 95.6% (Kappa = 0.701) showing a substantial agreement. The WHO BMI cut-off underestimated the prevalence of  by a maximum of 73.7% and by a minimum of 28.3% among males, while the values for underestimation ranged from 31.4-54.1% in females. The misclassification was minimal using the newly developed Ethiopian BMI cut-off. The prevalence of  was underestimated by a maximum of 9.% and overestimated by a maximum of 6.%. The WHO BMI cut-off failed to identify nearly half (46.6%) of Ethiopian adults who met the criteria for  using BF% in the overall sample.The findings suggest that WHO BMI cut-off (≥ 30 kg/m) is not appropriate for screening  among Ethiopian adults. The newly developed Ethiopian BMI cut-off showed a better performance with excellent sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and agreement indicating the diagnostic significance of it use as a simple, cost-effective, and valid indicator in clinical and community setups.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661004>Prevalence and correlates of adherence to movement guidelines among urban and rural children in Mozambique: a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Insufficient physical activity, short sleep duration, and excessive recreational screen time are increasing globally. Currently, there are little to no data describing prevalences and correlates of movement behaviours among children in low-middle-income countries. The few available reports do not include both urban and rural respondents, despite the large proportion of rural populations in low-middle-income countries. We compared the prevalence of meeting 24-h movement guidelines and examined correlates of meeting the guidelines in a sample of urban and rural Mozambican schoolchildren.This is cross-sectional study of 9-11 year-old children (n = 683) recruited from 10 urban and 7 rural schools in Mozambique. Moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and sleep duration were measured by waist-worn Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers. Accelerometers were worn 24 h/day for up to 8 days. Recreational screen time was self-reported. Potential correlates of meeting 24-h movement guidelines were directly measured or obtained from validated items of context-adapted questionnaires. Multilevel multivariable logit models were used to determine the correlates of movement behaviours. Meeting 24-h movement guidelines was defined as ≥60 min/day of MVPA, ≤ h/day of recreational screen time, and between 9 and 11 h/night of sleep.More rural (17.7%) than urban (3.6%) children met all three 24-h movement guidelines. Mean MVPA was lower (82.9 ± 29.5 min/day) among urban than rural children (96.7 ± 31.8 min/day). Rural children had longer sleep duration (8.9 ± 0.7 h/night) and shorter recreational screen time (.7 ± 1.9 h/day) than their urban counterparts (8.7 ± 0.9 h/night and 5.0 ± .3 h/day respectively). Parental education (OR: 0.37; CI: 0.16-0.87), school location (OR: 0.21; CI: 0.09-0.52), and outdoor time (OR: 0.67; CI: 0.53-0.85) were significant correlates of meeting all three 24-h movement guidelines.Prevalence and correlates of meeting movement guidelines differed between urban and rural schoolchildren in Mozambique. On average, both groups had higher daily MVPA minutes, shorter sleep duration, and higher recreational screen time than the 24-h movement guidelines recommend. These findings (e.g., higher than recommended mean daily MVPA minutes) differ from those from high-income countries and highlight the need to sample from both urban and rural areas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668975>Characteristics of newly diagnosed adults with type 1 diabetes in the UK and evolution of glycaemic control, body mass index and Charlson comorbidity index over the first 5 years after diagnosis.</a></h1><p>This retrospective, longitudinal study characterised 2430 adults (mean age 40.8±16.1years) with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (T1D) over the first 5years of insulin treatment.Data from 1year pre- and up to 5 years post-insulin initiation were extracted from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (1990-2013). Baseline HbA, BMI and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score were compared with data at 1, , 3 and 5 years.Mean HbA decreased significantly from baseline 95±32.8mmol/mol (10.8±3.0%) to 61±21.9mmol/mol (7.7±.0%) at 1year, remaining significantly lower at , 3 and 5 years (p<0.0001). One year after initiating insulin, only 6.3% of patients had HbA <48mmol/mol (<6.5%). There was no further improvement in HbA1c after 1year. Mean BMI increased significantly from baseline 25.3±5.5kg/m to 27.±5.8kg/m at 1year; p<0.0001), remaining significantly higher thereafter, with over two-thirds having overweight/ by year 5. Mean CCI score increased significantly (1.32, baseline; 1.46, year 1; 1.75, year 5). CCI patterns were similar within BMI and HbA strata.More intensive support to reach and maintain glycaemic targets soon post-diagnosis, while avoiding weight gain, and prevention and optimal management of comorbidities are warranted.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here we investigate the prevalence of  and -associated muscle wasting in PD patients.The study design was observational, cross sectional. Body composition was assessed with BIA and BIVA in 88 PD patients (53.4 ± 13.1 years; 67% male). Patients with  and/or with reduced muscle mass were identified using FMI and SM/BW cutoff values, respectively. Inflammatory status was assessed by measuring CRP and fibrinogen blood levels.A total of 44.3% of the patients showed a reduced muscle mass (37.5% moderate and 6.8% severe). The prevalence of  was 6.1%, 81.8%, and 100% in patients with normal, moderately, and severely reduced muscle mass, respectively (p < 0.05). Of the total, 15.% of the patients with normal muscle mass, 18.4% of those with moderately reduced muscle mass, and 66.7% of those with severely reduced muscle mass had diabetes. The prevalence of severe muscle mass loss was higher in those with diabetes than in those without diabetes (22.% vs. .8%, p < 0.05). Patients with -associated muscle wasting showed higher fibrinogen (613.9 ± 155.1 vs. 512.9 ± 159.5 mg/dL, p < 0.05) and CPR (1.4 ± 1.3 vs. 0.6 ± 0.8 mg/dL, p < 0.05) blood concentrations than those with normal body composition. and diabetes were strongly associated with muscle mass loss in our PD patients.

Exactly how the bacterial population affects weight loss and the results of surgery remain controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the intestinal microbiota of superobese patients before and after gastric bypass surgery (RYGB).DNA fragments for the microbiota obtained from stool samples collected from nine superobese patients before and after bariatric surgery were sequenced using Ion Torrent.We observed that with a mean follow-up of 15 months, patients achieved 55.9% excess weight loss (EWL). A significant population reduction in the Proteobacteria phylum (11 to %, p=0.0025) was observed after surgery, while no difference was seen in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Further analyses performed with two specific individuals with divergent clinical outcomes showed a change in the pattern between them, with a significant increase in Firmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes in the patient with less weight loss (%EWL 50.79 vs. 61.85).RYGB affects the microbiota of superobese patients, with a significant reduction in Proteobacteria in patients with different weight loss, showing that different bacteria may contribute to the process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677302>Bilateral multiple oncocytic cysts of the parotid gland in type  diabetes patients.</a></h1><p>The hallmarks of type  diabetes (T2D) are hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. These factors, at the cellular level, are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased glucose uptake. Such events are poorly explored in the context of the salivary glands. In this study, we present a series of eight cases of a distinct salivary gland lesion characterized by multiple oncocytic cysts, and we provide new pathologic insights regarding its pathogenesis.Seven patients (87.5%) had a confirmed T2D, and  was identified in five (62.5%) patients. Clinically, the patients demonstrated bilateral parotid gland swelling with recurrent episodes of pain and enlargements. Imaging exams revealed multiple cystic lesions in both parotid glands. Microscopically, the parotid glands showed multiple cysts of different sizes, lined by oncocytic epithelial cells. Intraluminally, high-eosinophilic glass-like crystalloid materials were observed. Immunohistochemical studies were performed and the most notable finding was GLUT1 overexpression in the oncocytic cysts (not observed in any other oncocytic lesion of patients without T2D). In addition, higher expressions of mitochondrial antigen, fission 1 protein, and mitofusin- were observed in the oncocytic epithelium of the cysts. Furthermore, most of the oncocytic cysts demonstrated a pattern of cytokeratin expression consistent with striated ducts.Thus, these results strongly suggest that T2D is associated with alterations in GLUT1 expression in the cells of striated ducts with mitochondrial dysfunction, causing a hyperplastic process characterized by multiple oncocytic cysts. For this lesion, the designation of "diabetes associated-bilateral multiple oncocytic cysts of the parotid gland" is proposed.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667878>Lifestyle-related risk factors among patients with coronary artery disease in Nepal.</a></h1><p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death and morbidity globally. South Asia, including Nepal, has higher risks for CAD due to relatively higher exposures to risk factors. This study evaluated the prevalence of lifestyle-related risk factors and the associations of risk factors with socio-demographic variables among CAD patients.A cross-sectional study was conducted among CAD patients (n = 224) admitted to a national heart centre in Nepal. Data on dietary habits, smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, physical activity, overweight or  and adherence to medication were collected using standard questionnaires. The numbers of risk factors were categorised into three groups (1- = low, 3 = medium, 4-7 = high). Data analysis was performed by cross-tabulation and multinomial logistic regression. Prevalence odds ratios (POR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as the measure of the associations.The prevalence of risk factors among patients varied from 23% to 97%, with stress being the most prevalent, and current alcohol consumption the least. The majority of study patients had multiple lifestyle-related risk factors. Male patients (POR for medium vs. low .83; 95% CI 1.3, 6.18) and patients with high incomes (POR for high vs. low .53; 95% CI 1.10, 5.83) had higher odds of being in the medium- and high-risk group, respectively.Lifestyle-related risk factors were highly prevalent among CAD patients. Various socio-demographic variables were associated with the risk groups. Intervention studies on lifestyle risk factor modifications among this target group are recommended.© 2019 Nordic College of Caring Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673986>Psychological distress and quality of life in Iranian adolescents with overweight/: mediating roles of weight bias internalization and insomnia.</a></h1><p>To examine whether weight-related self-stigma (aka weight bias internalization) and insomnia are potential predictors of psychological distress and quality of life (QoL) among Iranian adolescents with overweight (OW)/ (OB). To examine whether weight-related self-stigma and insomnia are potential mediators in the relationship between excess weight and health outcomes of distress and QoL.All participants (n = 934; 444 males; mean age = 15.7 ± 1. years; zBMI = .8 ± 1.0) completed questionnaires on weight-related self-stigma and insomnia at baseline. Six months later, they completed questionnaires on psychological distress and QoL to assess health outcomes. Relationships among variables were tested using mediation analyses with bootstrapping method.Weight-related self-stigma significantly mediated the effects of zBMI on psychological distress (effect = 0.22; bootstrapping SE = 0.09; 95% CI = 0.08, 0.45), psychosocial QoL (effect = - 0.64; bootstrapping SE = 0.19; 95% CI = - 1.10, - 0.32), and physical QoL (effect = - 1.35; bootstrapping SE = 0.54; 95% CI = - .43, - 0.26). Insomnia also significantly mediated the effects of zBMI on psychological distress (effect = .18; bootstrapping SE = 0.31; 95% CI = 1.61, .81), psychosocial QoL (effect = - 0.89; bootstrapping SE = 0.33; 95% CI = - 1.60, - 0.28), and physical QoL (effect = - 0.83; bootstrapping SE = 0.42; 95% CI = - 1.69, - 0.02).

Melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), contributes to appetite control in hypothalamic neurons and is a target for future anti- treatments (such as setmelanotide) or novel drug development effort. Proper MC4R trafficking regulation in hypothalamic neurons is crucial for normal neural control of homeostasis and is altered in  and in presence of lipids. The mechanisms underlying altered MC4R trafficking in the context of  is still unclear. Here, we discovered that C2CD5 expressed in the hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of MC4R endocytosis. This study unmasked a novel trafficking protein nutritionally regulated in the hypothalamus providing a novel target for MC4R dependent pathways involved in bodyweight homeostasis and .To evaluate the expression of C2cd5, we first used in situ hybridization and RNAscope technology in combination with electronic microscopy. For in vivo, we characterized the energy balance of wild type (WT) and C2CD5 whole-body knockout (C2CD5KO) mice fed normal chow (NC) and/or western-diet (high-fat/high-sucrose/cholesterol) (WD). To this end, we performed comprehensive longitudinal assessment of bodyweight, energy balance (food intake, energy expenditure, locomotor activity using TSE metabolic cages), and glucose homeostasis. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of loss of C2CD5 on feeding behavior changes normally induced by MC4R agonist (Melanotan, MTII) injection in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). For in vitro approach, we tease out the role of C2CD5 and its calcium sensing domain C2 in MC4R trafficking. We focused on endocytosis of MC4R using an antibody feeding experiment (in a neuronal cell line - Neuro2A (N2A) stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP; against HA-tag and analyzed by flux cytometry).We found that 1) the expression of hypothalamic C2CD5 is decreased in diet-induced  models compared to controls, ) mice lacking C2CD5 exhibit an increase in food intake compared to WT mice, 3) C2CD5 interacts with endocytosis machinery in hypothalamus, 4) loss of functional C2CD5 (lacking C2 domain) blunts MC4R endocytosis in vitro and increases MC4R at the surface that fails to respond to MC4R ligand, and, 5) C2CD5KO mice exhibit decreased acute responses to MTII injection into the PVH.Based on these, we conclude that hypothalamic C2CD5 is involved in MC4R endocytosis and regulate bodyweight homeostasis. These studies suggest that C2CD5 represents a new protein regulated by metabolic cues and involved in metabolic receptor endocytosis.

Whereas surgical outcomes have been extensively investigated, the impact of risk factors such as body mass index (BMI) and smoking on patient outcomes has not been explored. We hypothesized that  and smoking would have a negative impact on the functional and radiographic outcomes of surgically treated patients with distal radius fractures.We performed a retrospective analysis of patients surgically treated for a distal radius fracture between 2006 and 2017 at  level 1 trauma centers. Patients were divided into obese (BMI ≥ 30) and nonobese (BMI < 30) groups according to the World Health Organization BMI Classification. Patients were also divided into current, former, and never smokers based on reported cigarette use. Primary outcomes included patient-reported outcome measures (Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand [QuickDASH]), range of motion (ROM) arc (flexion-extension, pronation-supination), radiographic union (Radiographic Union Scoring System [RUSS] score), and change in radiographic alignment (radial height, radial inclination, volar tilt) between first and last follow-up. Multivariable models corrected for age, sex, comorbidities, fracture complexity, osteoporosis, and time to surgery.Two hundred patients were identified, 39 with BMI of 30 or greater and 161 with BMI less than 30. Obese patients had more comorbidities but similar fracture types. At 3-month and 1-year follow-up, both groups achieved acceptable QuickDASH scores, close to those of the general population (21 vs 18, 14 vs , respectively). The  groups were similar in regard to motion, RUSS score, and alignment. There were 148 never smokers, 32 former smokers, and 20 current smokers. At 3 months, smokers demonstrated higher QuickDASH scores (42 vs 21-24) and a lower percentage of radiographically healed fractures (40% vs 69%-82%). At final follow-up, smokers reported small differences in patient-reported outcomes (QuickDASH 18 vs 9-13) whereas ROM, fracture healing, and complication rates were similar.Both obese and nonobese patients can achieve excellent outcomes following surgical treatment of distal radius fracture with similar self-reported outcomes, motion, RUSS score, and alignment. Despite slower healing in the early postoperative period, smokers had similar QuickDASH scores, ROM, and union rates to past smokers and never smokers at final follow-up, with a similar complication profile.Prognostic IV.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

Multifaceted lifestyle interventions including diet and exercise are recommended as the first-line treatment for the metabolic syndrome.To investigate the effects of lifestyle interventions that include both diet interventions and supervised exercise on outcomes for people with metabolic syndrome.A systematic review and meta-regression was conducted. PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from the earliest date possible until November 2018 to identify randomised controlled trials examining the effects of lifestyle interventions compared to usual care on patient health outcomes and components of metabolic syndrome. Post-intervention means and standard deviations were pooled using inverse variance methods and random-effects models to calculate mean differences (MD), standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Searching identified 2598 articles, of which 15 articles reporting data from 10 trials, with 1160 participants were included in this review. Compared to usual care, supervised lifestyle intervention demonstrated significant improvements in all but one of the components of metabolic syndrome. Reductions were seen in waist circumference (-4.9 cm, 95%CI -8.0 to -1.7), systolic blood pressure (-6.5 mmHg, 95%CI -10.7 to -.3), diastolic blood pressure (-1.9 mmHg, 95%CI -3.6 to -0.), triglycerides (SMD -0.46, 95%CI -0.88 to -0.04) and fasting glucose (SMD -0.68, 95%CI -1.20 to -0.15). Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was reduced by 39% in intervention group participants compared to control group participants (Risk Ratio 0.61, 95%CI 0.38 to 0.96). Improvements in quality of life were not statistically significant.There is low to moderate quality evidence that supervised multifaceted lifestyle intervention improves multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome, as well as reducing prevalence of the disease. Health services should consider implementing lifestyle intervention programs for people with metabolic syndrome to improve health outcomes and prevent progression to chronic disease.Crown Copyright © 2019.

T2DM and CRC were defined according to International Classification of Disease codes (10th Revision) and claims data.  was defined using body mass index (BMI); abdominal  was defined according to waist circumference. Other variables were defined using demographic, anthropometric, and laboratory data.Overall, ,591,149 patients with T2DM were analyzed. During the follow-up period (median, 5.4 years), 24,236 CRC cases were identified. Aging (≥70 years), male sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, and insulin and/or sulfonylurea use were significant risk factors for CRC. In males, smoking and alcohol consumption were more likely to lead to CRC, whereas a BMI increase was a more significant risk factor in females. Females with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m and abdominal  were associated with an 18% increased risk of CRC compared with patients with normal weight and normal waist circumference (hazard ratio = 1.184, 95% confidence interval 1.123-1.25), whereas male patients with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m and abdominal  were associated with an 8% increased risk (hazard ratio = 1.087, 95% confidence interval 1.049-1.127).Patients had CRC risk factors that differed according to sex. Smoking and heavy alcohol consumption were risks of CRC in males.

As gut microbial imbalances and maladaptive host responses have been implicated in the pathology of  and diabetes, this study aimed to determine the effects of pharmacologically stimulated GLP-1 and GLP- receptor function on the gut microbiome composition in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice received treatment with a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide, 0. mg/kg, BID) or dual GLP-1/GLP- receptor agonist (GUB09-145, 0.04 mg/kg, BID) for 4 weeks. Both compounds suppressed caloric intake, promoted a marked weight loss, improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma cholesterol levels. 16S rDNA sequencing and deep-sequencing shotgun metagenomics was applied for comprehensive within-subject profiling of changes in gut microbiome signatures. Compared to baseline, DIO mice assumed phylogenetically similar gut bacterial compositional changes following liraglutide and GUB09-145 treatment, characterized by discrete shifts in low-abundant species and related bacterial metabolic pathways. The microbiome alterations may potentially associate to the converging biological actions of GLP-1 and GLP- receptor signaling on caloric intake, glucose metabolism and lipid handling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677868>Long-term exposure to PM and fasting plasma glucose in non-diabetic adolescents in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.</a></h1><p>Indonesia is facing serious air pollution. However, very few studies have been conducted to examine the health risks of air pollution in Indonesia, particularly for adolescents.To assess the association between long-term exposure to ambient particles with a diameter of <.5 μm (PM) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in adolescents.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 482 adolescents aged 14-18 years in Yogyakarta, Indonesia in 2016. We finally included 469 (97.30%) participants who had no missing data for data analysis. We collected individual data on socio-demographics, behavioral habits, and health information through standardized questionnaires. Satellite-based PM concentrations from 2013 to 2016 were assigned based on participants' residential addresses. The association between PM and FPG was examined using a generalized linear regression model while FPG was modeled as a continuous variable. An ordered logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between PM and FPG categories.Every 1 μg/m³ increase in PM was associated with a 0.34 mg/dL [95 confidence interval (95% CI): 0.08 mg/dL, 0.59 mg/dL] increase in FPG levels. Comparing with the low FPG level (under 86 mg/dL), every 1 μg/m³ increase in PM was associated with a 10.20% (95% CI: 1.60%, 19.80%) increase in the odds of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (100-125 mg/dL). Stratified analyses indicated greater effects on participants with hypertension [odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.57] and those had higher physical activities (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.57). Adolescents' sex,  status and different cutoff points of FPG did not modify the association between the exposure to PM and FPG levels.Long-term exposure to PM was associated with increased FPG levels in Indonesian non-diabetic adolescents.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Maintaining loco-regional control following breast cancer surgery is important as this can improve overall survival. While  has been associated with poorer survival in breast cancer, the correlation with locoregional control is less well evaluated and was the subject of this evaluation.We utilised the New Zealand breast cancer registry to identify patients treated with breast conservation with BMI recorded. We retrieved patient demographic, tumour characteristic and treatment related information. We assessed local, and locoregional control outcomes as well as breast cancer and overall survival outcomes.2513 patients were identified. The median follow up was 5.25 years. 38% of patients were obese with a body mass index (BMI) of >30kg/m, 32% were overweight with a BMI of 25.0-29.9kg/m and 29% were either normal or underweight with a BMI of <24.9kg/m. Most patients were post-menopausal (65%). The median tumour size was 16.0mm (0.2mm - 80mm) and the majority were grade  or 3 tumours (45% and 33%). The majority (66%) were pathologically node negative and LVI was seen in 24%. There were 81% with ER positivity and 358 (14.%) were Her- positive. Local relapse free survival at 5 years was 91.5% (95% CI 90.3-92.7) and at 10 years was 78.5% (95% CI 75.9-81.1). Local relapse free rate at 5 years was 96.8% (95% CI 96.0-97.6) and 10 years was 93.9% (95% CI 92.5-95.3). We did not find BMI to be associated with local or locoregional relapse, disease free, breast cancer specific or overall survival. was not associated with inferior locoregional control or survival outcomes.

We investigated the association between pre-pregnancy BMI and the risk of SGA infants in a Chinese population. We performed a cohort study among 12029 mothers with a pregnancy. This cohort consisted of pregnant women that were: normal-weight (62.02%), underweight (17.09%), overweight (17.77%) and obese (3.12%). Birth sizes were reduced in the underweight and obese groups compared with the normal-weight group. Linear regression analysis indicated that birth size was positively associated with BMI in both the underweight and normal-weight groups. Further analysis showed that 12.74% of neonates were SGA infants in the underweight group, higher than 7.43% of neonates reported in the normal-weight group (adjusted RR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.61, .30). Unexpectedly, 17.60% of neonates were SGA infants in the obese group, much higher than the normal-weight group (adjusted RR = .17; 95% CI: 1.57, 3.00). Additionally, 18.40% of neonates were large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants in the obese group, higher than 7.26% of neonates reported in the normal-weight group (adjusted RR = 3.00; 95% CI: .21, 4.06). These results suggest that pre-pregnancy underweight increases the risk of SGA infants, whereas  increases the risks of not only LGA infants, but also SGA infants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671517>The Low Prevalence of Overweight and  in Czech Breastfed Infants and Young Children: An Anthropological Survey.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of overweight and  in a sample of children who were exclusively or predominantly breastfed for at least 6 months compared to Czech references that were constructed based on a representative sample of children, regardless of their mode of feeding. Between 2008 and 2011, a longitudinal study on the growth of breastfed infants was carried out in the Czech Republic. Forty-three GP pediatricians addressed parents at 18-month preventive examinations and collected data on the families' socio-economic conditions and the infants' feeding conditions. The children were measured (length, weight, and head circumference), and anthropometric measurements from 10 previous preventive examinations were obtained from the health records. Out of the collected 1775 questionnaires, 960 children were selected according to the criteria of the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study. For the purpose of this study, 799 children who were exclusively or predominantly breastfed for at least 6 months were selected. We found that the proportions of children who were classified as overweight (>90th percentile) or obese (>97th percentile) at 6, 12, and 18-month examinations were far below the proportions of the Czech references.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between d-ROMs, BAP levels, and abdominal  in the Korean adult population using clinical data.A total of ,367 individuals, aged 18-86 years, were identified from health check-up examination records at a university hospital, between January 2015 and August 2016. Clinical and biochemical parameters, including waist circumference, lipid profile, alcohol drinking status, and smoking status, were investigated. Oxidative stress levels, viz., d-ROM concentration and antioxidant capacity, viz., BAP, were measured.Subjects with abdominal  presented significantly higher levels of d-ROMs compared to those with a normal waist circumference (P<0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, alcohol drinking status; smoking status; and triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein levels were found to have a significant positive correlation with abdominal  (P<0.001). BAP did not significantly correlate with abdominal .We observed a positive association between abdominal  and d-ROM concentration.

This work evaluated an educational intervention with the primary aim of preventing overweight and  in pre-school children.A pragmatic, cluster randomised trial with a parallel, matched-pair design was undertaken. Interventions were targeted at both the cluster (Early Years' Centres, matched by geographical area) and individual participant level (families: mother and -year old child). At the cluster level, a staff training intervention used the educational resource Be Active, Eat Healthy. Policies and provision for healthy eating and physical activity were evaluated at baseline and 12-months. The intervention at participant level was the Healthy Heroes Activity Pack: delivered over 6 months by Centre staff to promote healthy eating and physical activity in a fun, interactive way. Child and parent height and weight were measured at four time-points over  years. The trial primary outcome was the change in BMI z-score of the child between ages  and 4 years. Secondary outcomes consisted of parent-reported measures administered at baseline and two-year follow-up.Five pairs of Early Years' Centres were recruited. Four pairs were analysed as one Centre withdrew (47 intervention families; 34 control families). At the cluster level, improvement in Centre policies and practices was similar for both groups (p = 0.830). At the participant level, the intervention group reduced their mean BMI z-score between age  and 4 years (p = 0.002; change difference 0.49; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.80) whereas the control group showed increasing BMI z-score throughout. Changes in parent-reported outcomes and parent BMI (p = 0.582) were similar in both groups.The Healthy Heroes educational resource deterred excess weight gain in pre-school children from poor socioeconomic areas.

To better understand the effects of whole diets on stress system responsiveness, we examined randomized control trial effects of a whole food diet based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) on cortisol responsiveness. A randomized, double-blind, controlled 8-week intervention was conducted in overweight and obese women to examine differentiated effects between two diet intervention groups: one based on the 2010 DGA and the other one based on a typical American diet (TAD). During a test week that occurred at baseline and again after 8 weeks of the intervention, we assessed salivary cortisol collected at 14 selected times across the day, including upon awakening, at bedtime, and during a test visit, and administered a standardized social stress task (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). There were no statistical differences between the diet groups in salivary cortisol at baseline or after 8 weeks. However, when considering differences in dietary carbohydrate, but not fat or protein, from the pre-intervention (habitual) to the intervention period, there was a significant ( = 0.0001) interaction between diet group, intervention week, saliva sample, and level of intervention-based change in carbohydrate consumption. This interaction was reflected primarily by an 8-week reduction in salivary cortisol during a period just prior to (log Δ -0.35 ± 0.12 nmol/L) and 30 (log Δ -0.49 ± 0.12 nmol/L), 60 (log Δ -0.50 ± 0.13 nmol/L), 90 (log Δ -0.51 ± 0.13 nmol/L), and 120 (log Δ -0.4476 ± 0.1231 nmol/L) min after the TSST in the DGA group having the highest increase (90th percentile) in carbohydrate consumption. In support of this finding, we also found significant ( < 0.05) and inverse linear associations between dietary carbohydrate and log salivary cortisol, with the strongest negative association (β: -0.004 ± 0.0015,  = 0.009) occurring at 30 min post-TSST, but only in the DGA group and at week 9 of the intervention. Together, increasing dietary carbohydrate as part of a DGA-based diet may reduce circulating cortisol and dampen psychological stress-related cortisol responsiveness.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676640>Self-reported health problems and  predict sickness absence during a 12-month follow-up: a prospective cohort study in 21 608 employees from different industries.</a></h1><p>To study whether self-reported health problems predict sickness absence (SA) from work in employees from different industries.The results of a health risk appraisal (HRA) were combined with archival data of SA of 21 608 employees (59% female, 56% clerical).

Cold exposure has been reported to affect atherosclerosis through regulation of adipose function, but the mechanism has not been well clarified. Here, adipocyte hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIF-α) was upregulated after mild cold exposure at 16°C and mediated cold-induced thermogenesis. Adipocyte HIF-α deficiency exacerbated Western-diet-induced atherosclerosis by increasing adipose ceramide levels, which blunted hepatocyte cholesterol elimination and thermogenesis. Mechanistically, Acer2, the gene encoding alkaline ceramidase , was identified as a novel target gene of HIF-α, triggering ceramide catabolism. Adipose overexpression of ACER2 rescued adipocyte HIF-α-deficiency-induced exacerbation of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, activation of adipose HIF-α by the HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor FG-4592 had protective effects on atherosclerosis, accompanied by a reduction in adipose and plasma ceramide and plasma cholesterol levels.

A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and fatty liver were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and fatty liver. Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were  [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid  [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (5.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = .05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, fatty liver, high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central  and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society. Interventions are needed to minimize the potential predisposition of the Egyptian population to cardiometabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650094>Impact of Mood on Endothelial Function and Arterial Stiffness in Bipolar Disorder.</a></h1><p>Previous research in bipolar disorder demonstrates greater than expected vascular dysfunction later in the course of illness, proportionate to the cumulative burden of mood symptoms. However, little is known about the effect of acute mood states on vascular function. Here we examine the relation between vascular function and mood state in individuals with bipolar disorder.This prospective study followed 40 individuals with bipolar disorder for up to 6 months. Participants were assessed for mood state and vascular function at baseline,  weeks, and 6 months. Mood state was determined using clinician-administered Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale. Vascular function was assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, forearm vascular resistance (FVR), and arterial stiffness.Participants had a mean age of 30.1 years and 75% were male. Primary outcome measures FMD and nitroglycerine-mediated dilation were not found to have statistically significant associations with depressive or manic symptoms. In unadjusted models, higher manic symptoms were significantly associated with increased FVR nitroprusside-mediated dilation and diastolic blood pressure. In adjusted models, higher depressive symptoms were significantly associated with increases in augmentation index adjusted for heart rate of 75 bpm, and higher manic symptoms remained associated with increases in diastolic blood pressure.FMD may have limited sensitivity as a biomarker for measuring short-term effects of mood state. Longer-term prospective studies are needed to clarify the temporal relation between chronic mood symptoms and vascular function in bipolar disorder.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667610>Serum zonulin level is not elevated in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome without metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex disorder with gynecological, metabolic and carcinogenic effects. Increased intestinal permeability is related with , insulin resistance, type 1 and  diabetes mellitus. The existence of such a relationship between PCOS and intestinal permeability has come to an end. Zonulin can change intestinal permeability, and this effect is reversible. We studied the relation between zonulin and the hormonal and metabolic parameters of PCOS.A total of 45 women with PCOS and 17 healthy women were included in the study. Histories were taken from all the participants, body mass indexes were calculated, and biochemical tests and suprapubic over ultrasonography were made. Zonulin was studied with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Serum zonulin levels were similar between PCOS and control groups (p = 0.893). In all participants, there were negative correlations between zonulin and the total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and non-HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.00, 0.018, 0.004, 0.002), there were boundary correlations with age and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.052 and 0.058). No statistically significant was detected in the PCOS group except negative correlation between zonulin and age (p = 0.046), boundary correlation between zonulin and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.064).PCOS patients did not have metabolic syndrome. Zonulin was not higher in PCOS then controls, and it had only negative relation with age. The negative relation between zonulin and some metabolic parameters in all participants was not detected in PCOS group. So zonulin is not a useful molecule for the diagnosis of PCOS without metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656624>Association between adiposity levels and cognitive impairment in the Chilean older adult population.</a></h1><p>Although both  and ageing are risk factors for cognitive impairment, there is no evidence in Chile on how  levels are associated with cognitive function. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between adiposity levels and cognitive impairment in older Chilean adults. This cross-sectional study includes 1384 participants, over 60 years of age, from the Chilean National Health Survey 2009-2010. Cognitive impairment was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination. BMI and waist circumference (WC) were used as measures of adiposity. Compared with people with a normal BMI, the odds of cognitive impairment were higher in participants who were underweight (OR 4·44; 95 % CI ·43, 6·45;  < 0·0001), overweight (OR 1·86; 95 % CI 1·06, ·66;  = 0·031) and obese (OR ·26; 95 % CI 1·31, 3·21;  = 0·003). The associations were robust after adjustment for confounding variables. Similar results were observed for WC. Low and high levels of adiposity are associated with an increased likelihood of cognitive impairment in older adults in Chile.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668735>Impact of Animal Characters at a Zoo Concession Stand on Healthy Food Sales.</a></h1><p>The primary objectives of the study were to examine: 1) how increased availability of healthier items at a zoo concession stand affects sales and ) how animal character marketing on zoo menu boards affects sales revenue.An intervention was conducted over an 8-week period. On alternating weeks, zoo animal characters were systematically paired with and removed from healthy food items on a zoo concession menu board. Sales and revenue data were analyzed using frequencies, a Poisson regression model, and a negative binomial regression model, respectively.Newly introduced healthy items represented 8.% of sales and 4.9% of revenue. Healthy item unit sales were significantly higher (P = .006) during the weeks animal cartoon characters were displayed, although there was no impact on revenue.Findings suggest nonbranded character marketing is a viable strategy for promoting healthy products in family-friendly venues where concessions are sold.Copyright © 2019 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.

Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between alcohol consumption and high IOP (≥21 mm Hg).Flushers consuming ≤16 drinks per week had a significantly higher risk of high IOP than non-drinkers, depending on alcohol consumption (≤8 standard drinks: odds ratio [OR], 4.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05- 19.25; >8 but ≤16 standard drinks: OR, 8.14; 95% CI, 1.37-48.45). However, when the consumption was >16 drinks per week, the high IOP risk did not significantly increase (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.05-10.69). In addition, there was no significant relationship between alcohol consumption and high IOP among non-flushers consuming ≤8 drinks per week (OR, .07; 95% CI, 0.52-8.19). However, a significantly increased risk of high IOP was observed among nonflushers consuming >8 drinks per week, depending on alcohol consumption (>8 but ≤16 standard drinks: OR, 4.84; 95% CI, 1.14-20.61; >16 standard drinks: OR, 4.08; 95% CI, 1.02-16.26).This study suggests that obese men with alcohol flush reactions may have an increased risk of high IOP with the consumption of smaller amounts of alcohol than non-flushers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668723>Dietary n-6 to n-3 fatty acid ratio is related to liver fat content independent of genetic effects: Evidence from the monozygotic co-twin control design.</a></h1><p>Lifestyle changes focusing on diet and exercise remain the cornerstone of the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present co-twin control study of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs was designed to identify nutritional factors potentially involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.Cross-sectional study of 50 MZ twin pairs (age range: 23-36 years), of which ten pairs were discordant for liver fat (liver fat percentage of one twin ≤5% and his/her co-twin >5% and a difference between co-twins of >5%) as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Nutrient intake was calculated from 3-day food records.Among the ten liver fat-discordant twin pairs, the n-6: n-3 ratio was significantly higher in the twins with higher liver as compared to their co-twins with lower liver fat (6.6:1 vs. 3.:1, p-value = 0.005). In multiple regression analysis of within-pair differences including all 50 twin pairs, a higher n-6: n-3 ratio was significantly associated with a higher liver fat percentage within MZ twin pairs after adjustment for body mass index, energy intake and other covariates (standardized beta = 0.43, p-value = 0.001).Our findings suggest that the n-6: n-3 ratio is a promising dietary agent for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

Thus, we examined the association between waist and hip circumference with risk of PLC overall and by histologic type - hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The Liver Cancer Pooling Project is a consortium of prospective cohort studies that includes data from 1,167,244 individuals (PLC n=,208, HCC n=1,154, ICC n=335). Multivariable-adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using proportional hazards regression. Waist circumference, per 5 cm increase, was associated with an 11% increased PLC risk (HR=1.11, 95%CI: 1.09-1.14), including when adjusted for hip circumference (HR=1.12, 95%CI: 1.08-1.17) and also when restricted to individuals in a normal body mass index (BMI) range (18.5-<25 kg/m ; HR=1.14, 95%CI: 1.07-1.21). Hip circumference, per 5 cm increase, was associated with a 9% increased PLC risk (HR=1.09, 95%CI: 1.06-1.12), but no association remained after adjustment for waist circumference (HR=0.99, 95%CI: 0.94-1.03). HCC and ICC results were similar. These findings suggest that excess abdominal size is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer, even among individuals considered to have a normal BMI. However, excess gluteofemoral size alone confers no increased risk. Our findings extend prior analyses, which found an association between excess adiposity and risk of liver cancer, by disentangling the separate effects of excess abdominal and gluteofemoral size through utilization of both waist and hip circumference measurements.

However, there is a paucity of information on visfatin regulation in non-mammalian species. After characterization of chicken visfatin gene, we undertook this study to determine its hormonal regulation in avian (non-mammalian) liver cells. Addition of 5 ng/mL TNFα, 100 ng/mL leptin, 1, 3, 10 or 100 ng/mL T3 for 24 h upregulated visfatin gene expression by 1., 1.8, 1.95, 1.75, 1.80, and .45 folds (P < .05), respectively, compared to untreated LMH cells. Administration of 10 ng/mL of orexin A significantly down regulated visfatin gene expression by 1.35 folds compared to control cells. In contrast, treatment with IL-6 or orexin B for 24 h did not influence visfatin mRNA abundance. These pro-inflammatory cytokines and -related hormones modulate the expression of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptors. Hepatic CRP gene expression was significantly upregulated by IL-6, TNFα, orexin B, and T3 and down regulated by leptin and orexin A. LXR mRNA abundances were increased by orexin A, decreased by orexin B, and T3, and did not affected by IL6, TNFα, or leptin. The expression of FXR gene was induced by IL-6, leptin, and T3, but it was not influenced by TNFα, orexin A or B. CXR gene expression was up regulated by TNFα, leptin, orexin B, and T3, down regulated by 5 ng/mL orexin A, and did not affected by IL-6. INSIG2 mRNA levels were increased by TNFα (5 ng/mL), leptin (100 ng/mL), and T3 (1, 3, 10, and 100 ng/mL), decreased by orexin A, and remained unchanged with IL-6 or orexin B treatment. Together, this is the first report showing hormonal regulation of visfatin in avian hepatocyte cells and suggesting a potential role of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptor LXR, FXR, and CXR in mediating these hormonal effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects on body composition.To compare the long-term effects of weight loss via severe vs moderate energy restriction on lean mass and other aspects of body composition.The Type of Energy Manipulation for Promoting Optimum Metabolic Health and Body Composition in  (TEMPO) Diet Trial was a 12-month, single-center, randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least 5 years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%) energy restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%) energy restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate energy restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual body weight per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole-body lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were body weight, thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and fat mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.] years; mean [SD] weight, 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.4 [.5]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more weight (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8. to -5.1 kg), lost more whole-body lean mass (effect size, -1. kg; 95% CI, -.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4. cm2; 95% CI, -6.5 to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total weight loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole-body fat mass (effect size, -5.5 kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe energy restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole-body lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate energy restriction and was associated with -fold greater weight and fat loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate energy restriction. Therefore, caution is necessary when implementing severe energy restriction in postmenopausal women, particularly those with osteopenia or osteoporosis.anzctr.org.au Identifier: 12612000651886.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662187>Correlates of psychiatric inpatient readmissions of children and adolescents with mental disorders.</a></h1><p>To identify correlates of psychiatric readmission of youth, we conducted a consecutive, retrospective 1-year cohort study (07.01.2014-06.30.2015) of youth (age = 5-17.9) admitted to psychiatric inpatient facility. Stepwise elimination, multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify independent correlates of 1-year and 30-day psychiatric readmissions. The Family/Caregiver Interview Tool (FCIT) was given to caregivers of 30-day readmitted youth and analyzed using generalized linear model to predict time to readmission. Altogether, 1231 youth experienced 1534 hospitalizations. The 1-year readmission rate was 32.4%; 30-day readmission rate was 10.%. Significant independent correlates of readmissions were longer length of stay, higher antipsychotic treatment rates, living closer to the hospital, and comorbid , all accounting for 12.% of variance. FCIT revealed that caregiver's ability to fill prescription after discharge delayed readmission, while shorter time to follow-up appointment hastened it. Illness exacerbation was responsible for 73% of 30-day readmissions; system of care factors accounted for 13%. Compared to clinicians, caregivers significantly underestimated environment of care factors (including caregiver's mental health) as the primary cause for readmission. Readmissions are common and correlate with illness severity and systems of care factors. Family support services may help reduce readmissions. Hospital-specific qualitative investigation may help identify intervention targets to reduce readmissions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, this practice may be unnecessarily burdensome and time-consuming in the research setting.The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of SS criteria, and compare it to alternative approaches in adults with overweight and .In this cross-sectional, ancillary analysis, participants enrolled in a bariatric (study 1; n = 13) and lifestyle (study ; n = 51) weight loss intervention were included. Indirect calorimetry was performed during baseline measurements using a metabolic cart for 25 min, including a 5-min stabilization period at the start. SS was defined as the first 5-min period with a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤10% for both VO and VCO (hereafter REE). Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis in study  participants only. REE was compared against the lowest CV (REE), 5-min time intervals (REE, REE, REE, REE), 4-min and 3-min SS intervals (REE and REE), and time intervals of 6-15, 6-20 and 6-25 min (REE, REE, and REE) using repeated measures ANOVA and Bland-Altman analysis to test for bias, limits of agreement and accuracy (±6% measured REE).Participants were 54 ± 13 years old, mostly women (75%) and had a BMI of 35 ± 5 kg/m. Overall, 54/63 (84%) of participants reached REE, often (47/54, 87%) within the first 10-min (6-15 min). Alternative approaches to estimating REE had a relatively low bias (-16 to 13 kcals), narrow limits of agreement and high accuracy (83-98%) when compared to REE, in particular, outperforming standard prediction equations (e.g., Mifflin St. Joer).Indirect calorimetry measurements that utilize the 5-min SS approach to estimate REE are considered the gold-standard. Under circumstances of non-SS, it appears 4-min and 3-min SS periods, or fixed time intervals of atleast 5 min are accurate and practical alternatives for estimating REE in adults with overweight and . However, future trials should validate alternative methods in similar populations to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Use of sampling weights ensured the sample was representative of the population. The exposure was categorised as normal vaginal delivery (VD) [reference], assisted VD, planned CS and emergency CS. Childhood  prevalence, at age three, five, seven, eleven and fourteen years was calculated using the International  Taskforce criteria. Mixed-effects linear regression models were fitted with associations adjusted for several potential confounders like maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, education and infant macrosomia. Linear regression models were fitted evaluating body fat percentage (BF%), at age seven and fourteen years.Of the 18,116 infants, 3872 (21.4%) were delivered by CS; 9.% by planned CS.  prevalence was 5.4%, 5.7%, 6.5%, 7.1% and 7.6% at age three, five, seven, eleven and fourteen years respectively. The mixed-effects linear regression model showed no association between planned (adjusted mean difference = 0.00; [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10; 0.10], p-value = 0.97) or emergency CS (adjusted mean difference = 0.08; [95% CI -0.01; 0.17], p-value = 0.09) and child BMI. At age seven years, there was no association between planned CS and BF% (adjusted mean difference = 0.13; [95% CI -0.23; 0.49]); there was no association at age fourteen years.Infants born by planned CS did not have a significantly higher BMI or BF% compared to those born by normal VD.

Insulin and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) share many intracellular processes with both known to play a key role in glucose and protein metabolism in skeletal muscle.We aimed to compare IGF/IP6K1/Akt signalling and the plasma proteomic signature in individuals with a range of BMIs after ingestion of lean meat.Ten lean [Body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m): 22.7 ± 0.4; Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA): 1.36 ± 0.17], 10 overweight (BMI: 27.1 ± 0.5; HOMA: 1.25 ± 0.11), and 10 obese (BMI: 35.9 ± 1.3; HOMA: 5.82 ± 0.81) adults received primed continuous L-[ring-C]phenylalanine infusions. Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected at 0 min (post-absorptive), 120 min and 300 min relative to the ingestion of 170 g pork loin (36 g protein and 5 g fat) to examine skeletal muscle protein signalling, plasma proteomic signatures, and whole-body phenylalanine disappearance rates (R).Phenylalanine R was not different in obese compared to lean individuals at all time points and was not responsive to a pork ingestion (basal, P = .056; 120 & 300 min, P > .05). IP6K1 was elevated in obese individuals at 120 min post-prandial vs basal (P < .05). There were no acute differences plasma proteomic profiles between groups in the post-prandial state (P > .05).These data demonstrate, for the first time that muscle IP6K1 protein content is elevated after lean meat ingestion in obese adults, suggesting that IP6K1 may be contributing to the dysregulation of nutrient uptake in skeletal muscle. In addition, proteomic analysis showed no differences in proteomic signatures between obese, overweight or lean individuals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Mendelian randomization using GWAS meta-analysis data was performed to estimate the causal effect of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (PNPLA3, LYPLAL1, NCAN, GCKR) on eGFR (N 118,460), microalbuminuria (N 54,116), and impaired renal function (N 118,147).In total, ,023 participants (mean age 55.5 ± 6.0 years, 53% women) were included of which 29% had fatty liver and .0% chronic kidney disease stage ≥3. In joint models, VAT was associated with a -fold increased risk of microalbuminuria which was mainly driven by the association in women (total population: per standard deviation [SD] = 55.4 cm, odds ratio [OR] .02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-3.47; women: OR .83, 95% CI 1.44, 5.56), but HTGC was not (total population: per SD = 7.9%, OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.85, 1.70). No associations were found for VAT and HTGC with eGFR (VAT: per SD = 55.4 cm, OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83, 1.87; HTGC: per SD = 7.9%, OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42, 0.99). No causal effect of NAFLD on microalbuminuria or impaired renal function was found.In observational analyses, visceral fat was associated with microalbuminuria in women. Liver fat was not associated with microalbuminuria or renal function, which was supported by Mendelian randomization. Visceral fat might be more important than liver fat in the etiology of microalbuminuria.Copyright © 2019 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the role of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in increasing the risk of insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM remained elusive. The current study aimed to determine the role of ART in predicting insulin therapy in GDM women and investigate the clinical and biochemical factors predicting the need for insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM.In this prospective cohort study, 236 Iranian women with GDM were diagnosed by one-step oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between October 2014 and June 2017. They were mainly assigned to two groups; the first group (n = 100) was designated as ART which was further subdivided into two subgroups as follows: 60 participants who received medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and 40 participants who received MNT plus insulin therapy (MNT-IT). The second group (n = 136) was labeled as the spontaneous conception (SC), consisting of 102 participants receiving MNT and 34 participants receiving MNT in combination with IT (MNT-IT). The demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were compared between groups. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate prognostic factors for insulin therapy.A higher rate of insulin therapy was observed in the ART group as compared with the SC group (40% vs. 25%; P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that maternal age ≥ 35 years [OR: .91, 95% CI: (1.28-6.62)], high serum FBS [1.10: (1.04-1.16)], HbA1c [1.91 (1.09-3.34)], and ART treatment [.94: (1.24-6.96)] were independent risk factors for insulin therapy in GDM women.Apart from risk factors mentioned earlier, ART may be a possible prognostic factor for insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667363>Adipocyte browning and resistance to  in mice is induced by expression of ATF3.</a></h1><p>Billions of people have -related metabolic syndromes such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

ST32da, a synthetic ATF3 inducer isolated from , promoted ATF3 expression to downregulate adipokine genes and induce adipocyte browning by suppressing the carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 axis. Furthermore, ST32da increased white adipose tissue browning and reduced lipogenesis in HFD-induced obese mice. The anti- efficacy of oral ST32da administration was similar to that of the clinical drug orlistat. Our study identified the ATF3 inducer ST32da as a promising therapeutic drug for treating diet-induced  and related metabolic disorders.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673470>Predictors of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in a refugee population from an active conflict country, Syria.</a></h1><p>To elucidate predictors of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in refugees emigrating from an active conflict region (Syria).This study included Syrian pregnant women who gave birth in Etlik Zübeyde Hanım Training and Research Hospital between 2013 and 2016.

BP1-BP2 Region With Cortical and Subcortical Morphology and Cognition.</a></h1><p>Recurrent microdeletions and duplications in the genomic region 15q11. between breakpoints 1 (BP1) and  (BP2) are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. These structural variants are present in 0.5% to 1.0% of the population, making 15q11. BP1-BP2 the site of the most prevalent known pathogenic copy number variation (CNV). It is unknown to what extent this CNV influences brain structure and affects cognitive abilities.To determine the association of the 15q11. BP1-BP2 deletion and duplication CNVs with cortical and subcortical brain morphology and cognitive task performance.In this genetic association study, T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging were combined with genetic data from the ENIGMA-CNV consortium and the UK Biobank, with a replication cohort from Iceland. In total, 203 deletion carriers, 45 247 noncarriers, and 306 duplication carriers were included. Data were collected from August 2015 to April 2019, and data were analyzed from September 2018 to September 2019.The associations of the CNV with global and regional measures of surface area and cortical thickness as well as subcortical volumes were investigated, correcting for age, age2, sex, scanner, and intracranial volume. Additionally, measures of cognitive ability were analyzed in the full UK Biobank cohort.Of 45 756 included individuals, the mean (SD) age was 55.8 (18.3) years, and 23 754 (51.9%) were female. Compared with noncarriers, deletion carriers had a lower surface area (Cohen d = -0.41; SE, 0.08; P = 4.9 × 10-8), thicker cortex (Cohen d = 0.36; SE, 0.07; P = 1.3 × 10-7), and a smaller nucleus accumbens (Cohen d = -0.27; SE, 0.07; P = 7.3 × 10-5). There was also a significant negative dose response on cortical thickness (β = -0.24; SE, 0.05; P = 6.8 × 10-7). Regional cortical analyses showed a localization of the effects to the frontal, cingulate, and parietal lobes. Further, cognitive ability was lower for deletion carriers compared with noncarriers on 5 of 7 tasks.These findings, from the largest CNV neuroimaging study to date, provide evidence that 15q11. BP1-BP2 structural variation is associated with brain morphology and cognition, with deletion carriers being particularly affected. The pattern of results fits with known molecular functions of genes in the 15q11. BP1-BP2 region and suggests involvement of these genes in neuronal plasticity. These neurobiological effects likely contribute to the association of this CNV with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665202>Dietary quality among children from 6 months to 4 years, NHANES 2011-2016.</a></h1><p>The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide dietary recommendations for individuals aged ≥ y and metrics exist to assess alignment.

Observational studies in COPD indicate that low body mass index (BMI) is associated with worse outcomes, and overweight/ has a protective effect - the so-called " paradox". We aimed to determine the relationship between BMI and the rate of FEV decline in data from published clinical trials in COPD.We performed a systematic review of the literature, and identified 5 randomized controlled trials reporting the association between BMI and FEV decline. Four of these were included in the meta-analyses. We analyzed BMI in 4 categories: BMI-I (< 18.5 or <  20 kg/m), BMI-II (18.5 or 20 to < 25 kg/m), BMI-III (25 to < 29 or < 30 kg/m) and BMI-IV (≥29 or ≥ 30 kg/m). We then performed a meta-regression of all the estimates against the BMI category.The estimated rate of FEV decline decreased with increasing BMI. Meta-regression of the estimates showed that BMI was significantly associated with the rate of FEV decline (linear trend p = 1.21 × 10).These novel findings support the  paradox in COPD: compared to normal BMI, low BMI is a risk factor for accelerated lung function decline, whilst high BMI has a protective effect. The relationship may be due to common but as-of-yet unknown causative factors; further investigation into which may reveal novel endotypes or targets for therapeutic intervention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654550>Weighting approaches for a genetic risk score and an oxidative stress score for predicting the incidence of .</a></h1><p>We aimed to predict the incidence of  in a Korean population using a genetic risk score (GRS) constructed with -related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) along with an oxidative stress score (OSS).A total of 9,460 Korean subjects and 356,974 SNPs were included.

Eligible patients of Pacific Island ethnicity (Pacific patients) in New Zealand (NZ) follow this wider trend.The present study explored structural barriers contributing to Pacific patients' disproportionately high preoperative attrition rates from publicly-funded bariatric surgery in Auckland, NZ.Publicly-funded bariatric surgery programmes based in the wider Auckland area, NZ.Semi-structured interviews with health sector professionals (n=21) were conducted.Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach.Two primary themes were identified: (1)  which included  and  and ()  which included  and . Clinical environments and an under-representation of Pacific staff were considered to be barriers to developing emotional safety, trust and acceptance of the surgery process with patients and their families. Additionally, economic deprivation and lower health literacy impacted preoperative goals.Health professionals' accounts indicated that Pacific patients face substantial levels of disconnection in bariatric surgery programmes. Increasing representation of Pacific ethnicity by employing more Pacific health professionals in bariatric teams and finding novel solutions to implement preoperative programme components have the potential to reduce this disconnect. Addressing cultural competency of staff, increasing consultancy times and working in community settings may enable staff to better support Pacific patients and their families. Programme structures could be more accommodating to practical barriers of attending appointments, managing patients' preoperative health goals and improving patients' health literacy. Given that Pacific populations, and other patients from minority ethnic backgrounds living globally, also face high rates of  and barriers accessing bariatric surgery, our findings are likely to have broader applicability.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Here, we investigated effects and underlying mechanisms of LiCl on lipid accumulation. LiCl induced dose-dependent lipid accumulation in HepG2 and RAW264.7 cells under normal as well as high glucose conditions. LiCl exposure additionally promoted lipid accumulation in livers of zebrafish. SB216763, a specific GSK-3β inhibitor, did not affect lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Expression of key lipogenic enzymes, such as FAS and aP2, as well as SR-B1 were increased in RAW264.7 cells. LiCl enhanced FAS, ACC and SCD-1 mRNA levels while suppressing CPT-1 in HepG2 cells. LiCl stimulated DNA binding activities of SREBP-1c and ChREBP. LiCl activated AMPK phosphorylation but the AMPK inhibitor, AICAR, did not suppress LiCl-induced lipid accumulation in RAW264.7. LiCl, but not SB216763, induced a significant increase in ROS in RAW264.7 and HepG2 cells. NOX activity was dose-dependently enhanced by LiCl. Furthermore, NOX-1, NOX- and DUOX-1 mRNA levels were upregulated at an early stage of LiCl stimulation. LiCl-induced lipid accumulation was suppressed by the antioxidant, NAC, and inhibitors of NOX, DPI and APO. Phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of CREB were enhanced by LiCl. The cell-permeable cAMP analog, di-butyryl cAMP, not only promoted lipid accumulation itself but also LiCl-induced lipid accumulation in RAW264.7 cells. H-89, a PKA inhibitor, suppressed CREB activation, lipid accumulation and NOX activity in RAW264.7 cells. Our results indicate that LiCl stimulates lipid accumulation in hepatocyte and macrophage cells potentially through increased PKA-dependent ROS production.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this study is to explore GPs' perceptions and experiences of implementing GWG recommendations in GP-led antenatal care.A qualitative exploratory approach recorded GPs' experiences and insights regarding the application of GWG recommendations in practice. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews informed by the revised Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Deductive thematic analysis grouped coded text into TDF domains from which main themes were generated.Twenty GPs (13 female, 7 male) from metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia participated. Codes related to at least one of 11 TDF domains. Five main themes were apparent: 1) Despite low awareness of guidelines, GWG advice is provided; ) 'I should do this more'; 3) Lack of everyday resources; 4) Working 'against the odds' at times; and 5) Optimism and reality. GPs were aware of the importance of optimal GWG however, other pregnancy-related issues are given precedence during consultations. Enablers for the implementation of GWG guidelines were practitioner-based and included GPs' strong sense of their professional role to provide advice, and ongoing and trusting relationships with women throughout pregnancy. Barriers were mostly health system-based with limited time, remuneration, and restrictive referral pathways being limiting factors.There is a need to support GPs to provide GWG advice in accordance with current national guidelines. Solutions potentially lie in strategies that promote the effective dissemination and uptake of guidelines, and changes to policy and funding within the health-system so that longer GP-led antenatal care consultations are remunerated and referrals to allied health are accessible to women who require additional support to optimise GWG.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652915>Quantification of Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation in Metabolic Disease: Application to Type  Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Type  diabetes (T2D) is a growing health concern with nearly 400 million affected worldwide as of 2014. T2D presents with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance resulting in increased risk for blindness, renal failure, nerve damage, and premature death. Skeletal muscle is a major site for insulin resistance and is responsible for up to 80% of glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperglycemic clamps. Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is driven by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and for this reason mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in T2D. In this review we integrate mitochondrial function with physiologic function to present a broader understanding of mitochondrial functional status in T2D utilizing studies from both human and rodent models. Quantification of mitochondrial function is explained both in vitro and in vivo highlighting the use of proper controls and the complications imposed by  and sedentary lifestyle. This review suggests that skeletal muscle mitochondria are not necessarily dysfunctional but limited oxygen supply to working muscle creates this misperception. Finally, we propose changes in experimental design to address this question unequivocally. If mitochondrial function is not impaired it suggests that therapeutic interventions and drug development must move away from the organelle and toward the cardiovascular system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656583>Recent advances in understanding lipodystrophy: a focus on lipodystrophy-associated cardiovascular disease and potential effects of leptin therapy on cardiovascular function.</a></h1><p>Lipodystrophy is a disease characterized by a partial or total absence of adipose tissue leading to severe metabolic derangements including marked insulin resistance, type  diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and steatohepatitis. Lipodystrophy is also a source of major cardiovascular disorders which, in addition to hepatic failure and infection, contribute to a significant reduction in life expectancy.

Plasma VitD levels were measured in the first (T1) and/or second trimester (T2). Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used for evaluating the association of VitD with GDM.Prepregnancy BMI was positively associated with all three time-point glucose of OGTT. 25(OH)D level in T1 (β = -0.003) and T2 (β = -0.004), and its change from T1 to T2 (β = -0.004) were significantly and inversely associated with fasting blood glucose (FBG) of OGTT, but not 1-h and -h postload blood glucose of OGTT, respectively. The negative associations of VitD and FBG were stronger among overweight/obese women. VitD deficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml) in T2 was associated with an increased risk of GDM with increased FBG, GDM subtype 1 (OR: .10) and subtype 3 (OR: .19). Moreover, prepregnancy BMI modified this effect on GDM subtype 1 (BMI < 24: OR = 1.42; BMI ≥ 24: OR = 9.61, P for interaction = 0.002). Lower VitD increment from T1 to T2 was associated with a higher risk for GDM among overweight/obese women. Additionally, GDM prevalence fluctuated with the season, i.e. lower in summer/fall and higher in winter/spring.Maternal VitD deficiency was associated with a higher risk of GDM subtype with increased FBG, and the risk is much greater among overweight/ women. The lower the VitD increment during pregnancy, the greater the risk of GDM, especially in overweight/ women. Furthermore, seasonal variation of GDM may be exhibited as a critical confounder in the association of VitD and GDM.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

However, although there is a need to find a strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional strategies are not effective in weight loss and in long term weight maintenance. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a successful nutritional pattern to manage ; this is due to rapid weight loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in glucose metabolism. Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of data regarding to its management. Therefore, we will provide a useful guide to be used by nutrition experts taking care of subjects with . In particular, we will report recommendations on the correct use of this therapeutic approach for weight loss and management of side effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652691>Ethnic Variations in Nutritional Status among Preschool Children in Northern Vietnam: A Cross-Sectional Study.</a></h1><p>(1) Background: Vietnam is a multiethnic country undergoing rapid economic development, the improvement in nutritional status in preschool children is not equally shared by all ethnic groups; () Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed from September-December 2018 on 16,177 children aged 24-60 months representing Kinh ( = 14421), Muong ( = 1307) and Tay ( = 449) ethnic groups. Prevalence of malnutrition, overweight,  and anthropometric indices were compared across ethnic groups, using WHO 2006 child growth standards; (3) Results: The prevalence of malnutrition among children of Kinh, Muong and Tay origins was 14.7%, 34.3% and 43.%, respectively. The corresponding data for overweight was 5.5%, .7%, .% and for  .8%, 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. The prevalence of stunting remained the highest in three subtypes of malnutrition in all ethnic groups.

The prevalence of these risk factors differ by socioeconomic group in most populations, but this socially stratified distribution may depend on the social and cultural context. Little information on this topic is currently available in the Caribbean. The aim of this study was to describe the distribution of tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking and  by several socioeconomic determinants in the French West Indies (FWI).We used data from a cross-sectional health survey conducted in Guadeloupe and Martinique in 2014 in a representative sample of the population aged 15-75 years (n = 4054). All analyses were stratified by gender, and encompassed sample weights, calculated to account for the sampling design and correct for non-response. For each risk factor, we calculated weighted prevalence by income, educational level, occupational class and having hot water at home. Poisson regression models were used to estimate age-adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Current smoking and harmful chronic alcohol use were more common in men than in women (PR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.55-.09; PR = 4.53, 95% CI = 3.38-6.09 respectively). On the other hand, the prevalence of  was higher in women than in men (PR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.57-0.79). Higher education, higher occupational class and higher income were associated with lower prevalence of harmful alcohol drinking in men (PR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.25-0.72; PR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.53-1.01; PR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.51-1.03 respectively), but not in women. For tobacco smoking, no variation by socioeconomic status was observed in men whereas the prevalence of current smoking was higher among women with higher occupational class (PR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.13-1.91) and higher income (PR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.11-.03). In women, a lower prevalence of  was associated with a higher income (PR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.33-0.56), a higher occupational class (PR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.50-0.80), a higher educational level (PR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.26-0.50) and having hot water at home (PR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.54-0.80).Women of high socio-economic status were significantly more likely to be smokers, whereas alcohol drinking in men and  in women were inversely associated with socioeconomic status.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679370></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667614>Impact of age on morbidity and mortality following bariatric surgery.</a></h1><p>Bariatric surgery is the most effective modality to treat  and -related comorbidities. This study sought to utilize the MBASQIP® Data Registry to analyze the impact of age at time of surgery on outcomes following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures.The MBSAQIP® Data Registry for patients undergoing SG or RYGB procedures between 2015 and 2016 was reviewed. Patients were divided into 4 age groups [18-44; 45-54; 55-64; > 65 years]. Minimal exclusions for revisional and/or emergency surgery were selected and combination variables created to classify complications as major or minor. A comorbidity index was constructed to include diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and prior cardiac surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare age stratifications to the young adult (18-45 years) cohort.Of 301,605 cases, 279,419 cases (71.% SG) remained after applying exclusion criteria (79.% female, mean BMI 45.5 ± 8.1 kg/m, 8.9% insulin-dependent diabetics). Mean age was 44.7 ± 12.0 years (51.3% 18-44 years; 26.9% 45-54 years; 16.3% 55-64 years; 5.5% > 65 years). A univariate analysis demonstrated preoperative differences of lower BMI with increasing age concomitant with increasing frequency of RYGB and a higher comorbidity index (p < 0.0001 vs. 18-45 years). At age > 45 years, major complications and 30-day mortality increased independent of procedure type (p < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis controlling for comorbidity indices demonstrated increasing age (> 45 years) increased risk for major complications and mortality.Overall, bariatric surgery (SG or RYGB) remains a low mortality risk procedure for all age groups. However, all age group classifications > 45 years had higher incidence of major complications and mortality compared to patients 18-45 years (despite older individuals having lower preoperative BMI) indicating delaying surgery is detrimental.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653214>Protein hydrolysate from potato confers hepatic-protection in hamsters against high fat diet induced apoptosis and fibrosis by suppressing Caspase-3 and MMP2/9 and by enhancing Akt-survival pathway.</a></h1><p>A potato protein hydrolysate, APPH is a potential anti- diet ingredient. Since,  leads to deterioration of liver function and associated liver diseases, in this study the effect of APPH on high fat diet (HFD) associated liver damages was investigated.Six week old male hamsters were randomly separated to six groups (n = 8) as control, HFD (HFD fed obese), L-APPH (HFD + 15 mg/kg/day of APPH), M-APPH (HFD + 30 mg/kg/day), H-APPH (HFD + 75 mg/kg/day of APPH) and PB (HFD + 500 mg/kg/day of probucol). HFD fed hamsters were administered with APPH 50 days through oral gavage. The animals were euthanized and the number of apoptotic nuclei in liver tissue was determined by TUNEL staining and the extent of interstitial fibrosis was determined by Masson's trichrome staining. Modulation in the molecular events associated with apoptosis and fibrosis were elucidated from the western blotting analysis of the total protein extracts.Hamsters fed with high fat diet showed symptoms of liver damage as measured from serum markers like alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels. However a 50 day long supplementation of APPH effectively ameliorated the effects of HFD. HFD also modulated the expression of survival and apoptosis proteins in the hamster liver. Further the HFD groups showed elevated levels of fibrosis markers in liver. The increase in fibrosis and apoptosis was correlated with the increase in the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (pERK1/) revealing a potential role of ERK in the HFD mediated liver damage. However APPH treatment reduced the effect of HFD on the apoptosis and fibrosis markers considerably and provided hepato-protection.APPH can therefore be considered as an efficient therapeutic agent to ameliorate high fat diet related liver damages.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676651>Can the Healthy Primary School of the Future offer perspective in the ongoing  epidemic in young children?

The 'Healthy Primary School of the Future' (HPSF) aims to improve children's health and well-being by enhancing school health promotion. The current study aims to assess the effect of HPSF on children's body mass index (BMI) z-score after 1 and  years follow-up and to investigate whether HPSF has different effects within specific subgroups of children.A longitudinal quasi-experimental design.Four intervention and four control schools participated; located in a low socioeconomic status region in the Netherlands.1676 children (aged 4-12 years).HPSF uses a contextual systems approach and includes health-promoting changes in the school. Central to HPSF is the provision of a daily healthy lunch and structured physical activity sessions each day. Two intervention schools implemented both changes (full HPSF), two intervention schools implemented only the physical activity change (partial HPSF).BMI z-score, determined by measurements of children's height and weight at baseline, after 1 and  years follow-up.The intervention effect was significant after 1-year follow-up in the partial HPSF (standardised effect size (ES)=-0.05), not significant in the full HPSF (ES=-0.04). After  years follow-up, BMI z-score had significantly decreased in children of both the full HPSF (ES=-0.08) and the partial HPSF (ES=-0.07) compared with children of the control schools, whose mean BMI z-score increased from baseline to  years. None of the potential effect modifiers (gender, baseline study year, socioeconomic status and baseline weight status) were significant.HPSF was effective after 1 and  years follow-up in lowering children's BMI z-scores.

Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to measure frailty development (n = 7420) and linear regression models to measure frailty progression over 12 years follow-up (n = 8780).Increasing age (HR: 1.08 (CI: 1.08-1.09)), being in the lowest wealth quintile (HR: 1.79 (CI: 1.54-.08)), lack of educational qualifications (HR: 1.19 (CI: 1.09-1.30)),  (HR: 1.33 (CI: 1.18-1.50) and a high waist-hip ratio (HR: 1.25 (CI: 1.13-1.38)), being a current or previous smoker (HR: 1.29 (CI: 1.18-1.41)), pain (HR: 1.39 (CI: 1.34-1.45)), sedentary behaviour (HR: .17 (CI: 1.76-.78) and lower body strength (HR: 1.07 (CI: 1.06-1.08)), were all significant risk factors for frailty progression and incidence after simultaneous adjustment for all examined factors.The findings of this study suggest that there may be scope to reduce both frailty incidence and progression by trialling interventions aimed at reducing  and sedentary behaviour, increasing intensity of physical activity, and improving success of smoking cessation tools. Furthermore, improving educational outcomes and reducing poverty may also reduce inequalities in frailty.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652917>Metabolic Cytokines at Fasting and During Macronutrient Challenges: Influence of , Female Androgen Excess and Sex.</a></h1><p>Cytokines have pleiotropic functions within the organism and their levels may be influenced by , visceral adiposity and sex hormones. Diet composition may also affect their systemic concentrations during fasting and in the postprandial period. Hence, we studied the influence of sex steroids and  on the circulating levels of a panel of metabolic cytokines in the fasting state and after single macronutrient challenges.On alternate days we submitted 17 women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (9 non-obese, 8 obese), 17 non-hyperandrogenic control women (9 non-obese, 8 obese) and 19 control men (10 non-obese, 9 obese) to isocaloric oral glucose, lipid and protein loads. Serum levels of omentin-1, vaspin, lipocalin-, adipsin, PAI-1, chemerin, FGF-21 and FGF-23 were determined by Luminex multiplex technology.During fasting, obese patients presented higher levels of PAI-1, chemerin and adipsin but decreased FGF-23 and omentin-1 compared with non-obese subjects. Vaspin showed sexual dimorphism with lower levels in men than women with PCOS and female controls. Following macronutrient ingestion, most metabolic cytokines presented a similar physiological response consisting of a decrease in circulating concentrations, which was inversely associated with the fasting levels of these molecules. Protein intake caused the major postprandial decrease whereas glucose did not significantly reduce PAI-1, FGF-23 and vaspin, and even increased FGF-21. Regardless of the macronutrient administered, vaspin levels showed a larger reduction in non-obese individuals while the decrease in PAI-1 was particularly noticeable in the obese subgroup. The postprandial reductions of omentin-1 and FGF-23 after glucose and protein loads were influenced by . No major differences were found between patients with PCOS and male and female controls., but not PCOS or sex, markedly influences metabolic cytokine levels at fasting and after macronutrient ingestion. The observed postprandial decrease in their circulating concentrations might represent a physiological compensatory mechanism against food-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. This mechanism is altered by  and is differently modulated by macronutrients, suggesting a larger contribution of glucose to stressful postprandial responses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672147>Luseogliflozin attenuates neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in high-fat diet-fed mice via inhibition of perivascular adipose tissue remodeling.</a></h1><p>Excess fat deposition could induce phenotypic changes of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT remodeling), which may promote the progression of atherosclerosis via modulation of adipocytokine secretion. However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter  (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice.Wilt-type mice fed with low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25 days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed.In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf-b in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio.Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF-B expression in PVAT. Inhibition of PVAT remodeling by luseogliflozin may be a novel therapeutic target for vascular remodeling after angioplasty.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659466>Trends in age- and sex-adjusted body mass index and the prevalence of malnutrition in children with cancer over 42 months after diagnosis: a single-center cohort study.</a></h1><p>The adequate nutritional status of pediatric cancer patients is particularly important to enable them to cope with the demands of the disease and its treatment and to maintain normal growth. Malnutrition and  have both been associated with reduced survival and increased drug toxicity. We investigated trends in the age- and sex-adjusted body mass index (ISO-BMI) and the prevalence of malnutrition in a Finnish cohort of 139 consecutive children receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with a follow-up period of 42 months after diagnosis. In total, 28% (39/139) of the patients experienced malnutrition (ISO-BMI < 17 or > 10% weight loss), and 12% (16/139) had a nasogastric tube or underwent gastrostomy. Patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemia (5/10), central nervous system (CNS) tumors (5/13), or solid tumors (13/31) most frequently suffered from malnutrition. There was a significant increase in the ISO-BMI of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (+ .1 kg/m) and lymphomas (+ .4 kg/m) during the first 6 months, and the ISO-BMI of patients with ALL remained higher at 42 months compared to baseline (+ 1.9 kg/m).Conclusion: The cumulative incidence of malnutrition in Finnish pediatric cancer patients is comparable to that reported in other populations. The nutritional status of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, CNS tumors, or solid tumors should be monitored with extra care to facilitate early intervention in the case of impending malnutrition. What is known: • Both malnutrition and  are associated with reduced survival and increased drug toxicity in pediatric cancer patients. What is new: • Overall, 28 % of Finnish children receiving chemotherapy for cancer suffer from malnutrition during the first 42 months following the initial cancer diagnosis. • ISO-BMI curves from initial diagnosis to 42 months after diagnosis are provided for patients with different types of cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677016>Definitions of Long-Term Weight Regain and Their Associations with Clinical Outcomes.</a></h1><p>The prevalence and clinical significance of weight regain after bariatric surgery remains largely unclear due to the lack of a standardized definition of significant weight regain. The development of a clinically relevant definition of weight regain requires a better understanding of its clinical significance.To assess rates of weight regain 5 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), applying six definitions and investigating their association with clinical outcomes.Patients were followed up until 5 years after surgery and weight regain was calculated. Regression techniques were used to assess the association of weight regain with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the presence of comorbidities.A total of 868 patients participated in the study, with a mean age of 46.6 (± 10.4) years, of which 79% were female. The average preoperative BMI was 44.8 (± 5.9) kg/m and the total maximum weight loss was 32% (± 8%). Eighty-seven percent experienced any regain. Significant weight regain rates ranged from 16 to 37% depending on the definition. Three weight regain definitions were associated with deterioration in physical HRQoL (p < 0.05), while associations between definitions of weight regain and the presence of comorbidities 5 years after surgery were not significant.These results indicate that identifying one single categorical definition of clinically significant weight regain is difficult. Additional research into the clinical significance of weight regain is needed to inform the development of a standardized definition that includes all dimensions of surgery success: weight, HRQoL, and comorbidity remission.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves lipid and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of lipid metabolism in obese patients with no overt type  diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type  diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without diabetes. Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type  diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type  diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

However, the mechanism underlying this association remains poorly understood. In the present study, a gilt  model was developed by exposure to different energy diets and used to investigate the role of NADPH oxidase  (Nox2) in the placenta. Specifically, 99 gilts (Guangdong Small-ear Spotted pig) at day 60 of gestation were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatments: low-energy group (L, DE = 11.50 MJ/kg), medium-energy group (M, DE = 12.41 MJ/kg), and high-energy group (H, DE = 13.42 MJ/kg), with 11 replicate pens per treatment and 3 gilts per pen. At the start of the study, maternal body weight and backfat thickness were not significantly different in the three treatments. After the study, data indicated that the H group had higher body weight and backfat thickness gain for gilts during gestation and lower piglet birth weight compared with the other two groups. Additionally, the H group showed glucolipid metabolic disorders and increased triglyceride and nonesterified fatty acid contents in the placenta of gilts. Compared with the L group, the H group exhibited lower mitochondrial biogenesis and increased oxidative damage in the placenta. Importantly, increased mRNA expression and protein abundance of Nox2 were observed for the first time in H group placentae. Furthermore, compared with the L group, the H group showed a decrease in the density of placental vessels and the protein levels of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  (p-VEGFR2) as well as the immunostaining intensity of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31). Our findings suggest that maternal high-energy diet-induced  increases placental oxidative stress and decreases placental angiogenesis possibly through the upregulation of Nox2.Copyright © 2019 Chengjun Hu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654234>Internalized weight bias and cortisol reactivity to social stress.</a></h1><p>Weight-associated stigmatization and discrimination may induce chronic stress in individuals with . As a consequence, this stressor may cause an imbalance of HPA stress axis leading to increased eating behavior, and ultimately, weight gain. However, the direct link between internalized weight bias and stress response to acute stressors via cortisol secretion has not been investigated so far. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between internalized weight stigma as a stressor and cortisol reactivity in an acute psychosocial stress situation induced by the Trier Socials Stress Test for groups (TSST-G). Participants with BMI >30 kg/m (n = 79) were included in the study. Results reveal that while individuals with low internalized stigma reacted as predicted with an increase in cortisol secretion to acute psychosocial stress, individuals with medium or high internalized stigma did not show a typical cortisol response. However, these findings depend on the several factors, for instance on gender. In sum, acute stress in individuals with internalized weight bias seems to blunt HPA axis reactions to acute psychosocial stress. The study contributes to the understanding of the psychological and endocrinological consequences of internalized weight bias and underlines the importance of interventions to reduce stigmatization.</p></html>
