However, data on breast milk composition and its relation with growth are sparse.We investigated whether short-chain   (SCFAs), known to be present in HM and linked to energy metabolism, are associated with infancy anthropometrics.In a prospective birth cohort, HM hindmilk samples were collected from 619 lactating mothers at 4-8 wk postnatally [median (IQR) age: 33.9 (31.3-36.5) y, body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2): 22.8 (20.9-25.2)]. Their offspring, born at 40.1 (39.1-41.0) wk gestation with weight 3.56 (3.22-3.87) kg and 51% male, were assessed with measurement of weight, length, and skinfold thickness at ages 3, 12, and 24 mo, and transformed to age- and sex-adjusted z scores. HM SCFAs were measured by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and GC-MS. Multivariable linear regression models were conducted to analyze the relations between NMR HM SCFAs and infancy growth parameters with adjustment for potential confounders.NMR peaks for HM butyrate, , and formic acid, but not propionate, were detected. Butyrate peaks were 17.8% higher in HM from exclusively breastfeeding mothers than mixed-feeding mothers (P = 0.003). HM butyrate peak values were negatively associated with changes in infant weight (standardized B  = -0.10, P = 0.019) and BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) between 3 and 12 mo, and negatively associated with BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) and mean skinfold thickness (B = -0.10, P = 0.049) at age 12 mo. HM formic acid peak values showed a consistent negative association with infant BMI at all time points (B < = -0.10, P < = 0.014), whereas HM  was negatively associated with skinfold thickness at 3 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.028) and 24 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.036).These results suggest that HM SCFAs play a beneficial role in weight gain and adiposity during infancy. Further knowledge of HM  function may inform future strategies to support healthy growth.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981485>Assessment of rumen bacteria in dairy cows with varied milk protein yield.</a></h2><p>The present study was conducted to assess rumen bacteria in lactating cows with different milk protein yield, aiming to understand the role of rumen bacteria in this trait. Cows with high milk protein yield (high milk yield and high milk protein content, HH; n = 20) and low milk protein yield (low milk yield and low milk protein content, LL; n = 20) were selected from 374 mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows fed a high-grain diet. Measurement of the rumen fermentation products showed that the concentrations of ruminal total , propionate, butyrate, and valerate and the proportion of isobutyrate were higher in the HH cows than in the LL cows. Amplicon sequencing analysis of the rumen bacterial community revealed that the richness (Chao 1 index) of rumen microbiota was higher in the LL cows than in the HH cows. Among the 10 predominant bacterial phyla (relative abundance being >0.10%, present in >60% of animals within each group), the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was 1.36-fold higher in the HH cows than in the LL cows. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Succinivibrio was significantly higher and that of Clostridium tended to be higher in the LL cows than in the HH cows. Sharpea was 2.28-fold enriched in the HH cows compared with the LL cows. Different relationships between the relative abundances of rumen microbial taxa and   acid concentrations were observed in the HH and the LL animals, respectively. Succinivibrio and Prevotella were positively correlated with , propionate, and valerate in the LL cows, whereas Sharpea was positively correlated with propionate and valerate concentrations in the HH cows. Collectively, our results revealed that rumen bacterial richness and the relative abundances of several bacterial taxa significantly differed between dairy cows with high and low milk protein yields, suggesting the potential roles of rumen microbiota contributing to milk protein yield in dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Developing a highly productive microbial electrosynthesis reactor requires excellent electrical connection between the electrochemical setup, the cathode, and the microbes. Copper is a highly conductive cathode material widely employed in electrochemical apparatuses. However, the antimicrobial properties of copper limit its usage for bioelectrochemistry. Here, biocompatible reduced graphene oxide coated on copper foam is synthesized as a cathode material for the microbial electrosynthesis of  from CO. Dense and electroactive Sporomusa ovata biofilms form on the surface of reduced graphene oxide-coated copper foam electrodes while only scattered and damaged cells cover uncoated copper electrodes. Besides the formation of metabolically-active biofilms,  production rate from CO is 21.3 and 43.5-fold higher with this novel composite cathode compared with an uncoated copper foam cathode and a reversed cathode made of reduced graphene oxide foam coated with copper, respectively. The results demonstrate that reduced graphene oxide can be employed as a biocompatible and conductive buffer between microbes and bactericidal electrode materials with excellent electrochemical property to enable highly performant microbial electrosynthesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Considering that tyrosine production is gradually shifting to microbial production method, its production from  can be attempted to further improve the economic feasibility of its production.Here, we engineered a previously reported strain, SCK1, for efficient production of tyrosine from . Initially, the  uptake and gluconeogenic pathway were amplified to maximize the flux toward tyrosine. As flux distribution between glyoxylate and TCA cycles is critical for efficient precursor supplementation, the activity of the glyoxylate cycle was precisely controlled by expression of isocitrate lyase gene under different-strength promoters. Consequently, the engineered strain with optimal flux distribution produced 0.70 g/L tyrosine with 20% of the theoretical maximum yield which are 1.6-fold and 1.9-fold increased values of the parental strain.Tyrosine production from  requires precise tuning of the glyoxylate cycle and we obtained substantial improvements in production titer and yield by synthetic promoters and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). This is the first demonstration of tyrosine production from . Our strategies would be widely applicable to the production of various chemicals from  in future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650328>Successful elevation of circulating  and propionate by dietary modulation does not alter T-regulatory cell or cytokine profiles in healthy humans: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Increased circulating concentrations of short-chain   () achieved by ingestion of high-fibre diets is associated with anti-inflammatory effects through promotion of FoxP3+ regulatory T(reg) cells in mouse models. This study aimed to determine whether similar increments in blood  levels can be achieved in humans and whether these are associated with similar immune modulatory effects.In a pilot single-blinded, randomised, controlled cross-over study in ten healthy subjects, the effects were determined of high- (39 g/day) and low-fibre (18 g/day) intake (all food provided) on  (gas chromatography), proportions of Treg cells (flow cytometry) and a panel of cytokines (multiplex methodology) measured in peripheral blood at day 5 of each diet.Actual fibre intake differed between the diets by 19 [16-21] g/day (P< 0.001). Median [range] total plasma  levels with high-fibre intake were 174.5 [104.8-249.5] µmol/L, which were greater than those associated with low-fibre intake at 59.0 [26.5-79.9] (P < 0.001). Differences were significantly different for both  and propionate. The frequencies of total CD4 T cells and T-regulatory cells, and concentrations of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were not significantly different between the dietary interventions.Plasma  levels can be modulated by altering dietary fibre consumption in healthy individuals with increments similar to those achieved in murine studies. Five days of diet intervention did not result in changes in regulatory T-cell proportions and cytokine concentrations in peripheral blood, and may require longer duration of dietary change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108132>Gut dysbiosis and lack of short chain   in a Chinese cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Recent studies, mostly conducted in Western countries, showed that gut microbes are involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS).The aim of this study was to investigate whether gut dysbiosis is relevant to the initiation and progression of MS in a Chinese population.Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and gas chromatography (GC) were integrated and used to compare the fecal bacterial communities and the short-chain  acid () levels among relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients (n = 34), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients (n = 34), and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 34). T-cell profile analyses were performed by flow cytometry for MS patients and matched controls (n = 12).(1) The gut microbiome of MS patients was characterized by an increase of Streptococcus and a decrease of Prevotella_9; additionally, compared to NMOSD patients, Prevotella_9 was found to be much more abundant in MS patients. (2) A striking depletion of fecal , propionate, and butyrate was observed in MS patients compared to HCs. (3) The abundance of Streptococcus was negatively correlated with the proportion of pTregs (P < 0.05) and positively correlated with Th17 cells (P < 0.05) in the peripheral blood, while the abundance of Prevotella_9 was negatively correlated with the Th17 cell frequency (P < 0.01), and the fecal  level was positively correlated with pTreg frequency (P < 0.05).Gut dysbiosis and a lack of SCFAs exist in Chinese MS patients, which might be related to an aberrant immune response of MS; this relationship may have a diagnostic and therapeutic value for patients with MS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the problems is that for the polar probe molecules of dichloromethane, acetone, ethyl , tetrahydrofuran, and ethanol, the molecular area of each probe has different values in literature. In this paper, we point out the incorrect molecular area values presented in the literature by comparing these values with those indicated in Smallwood's Handbook of Organic Solvent Properties. The correct molecular area values of 11 polar probes are determined by plotting the molecular areas of the polar probes versus the van der Waals surface areas reported in the handbook. The correct molecular areas for six common polar probes, namely, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, acetone, ethyl , diethyl ether, and tetrahydrofuran, are 38.0, 44.0, 42.5, 48.0, 47.0, and 45.0 Å, respectively. Benzene is a specific molecule with a conjugated π-bond structure, and its molecular area is estimated to be larger than that of other molecules. Therefore, benzene is unsuitable for use as a probe molecule.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This system largely involves two processes: (i) bioconversion of algal residue to VFAs by anaerobic fermentation, and (ii) cultivation of microalgae using the produced VFAs. The carbon balance for each unit process was examined to assess how much carbon in algal residue can be converted to these major VFAs and then assimilated to microalgae biomass. First, the yield and the profile of VFAs from raw algae (RA) and lipid-extracted algae (LEA) at psychrophilic (15 °C), mesophilic (35 °C), and thermophilic conditions (55 °C) were compared. When digesting the LEA under the thermophilic condition, the highest conversion yield, 0.36 (g carbon in VFAs/g carbon in biomass), with a compositional ratio of 6:1:3 (HAc: HPr: HBu) was obtained. Consumption of VFAs for microalgal growth reached a maximum value of 0.66 (g VFAs assimilated to biomass/g VFAs provided) at the compositional ratio of 6:1:3. Consequently, the maximum total carbon recycling ratio was 23.8% when fermenting LEA at the thermophilic condition. Our findings comprehensively revealed that establishing conditions that convert LEA to higher content of  is a decisive factor. It was estimated that around 40% of the total carbon from the LEA can be recovered for the production of algal biomass, when increasing the VFA conversion yield beyond 60% by adopting pretreatment methods.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was to investigate the effects of elevated H produced by elemental Mg on rumen fermentation and methanogenesis in dairy cows. Four nonlactating Chinese Holstein dairy cows were employed for this experiment in a replicated crossover design. The 2 dietary treatments included a basal diet supplemented with Mg(OH) (14.5 g/kg of feed dry matter) or elemental Mg (6.00 g/kg of feed dry matter). When compared with Mg(OH) treatment, cows fed diet with elemental Mg had similar rumen Mg concentration, but higher rumen dissolved H and methane concentrations at 2.5 h after morning feeding. Also, elemental Mg supplementation decreased feed digestibility, rumen   acid concentration, and relative abundance of group Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, genus Bifidobacterium, and group Mollicutes_RF9, increased  to propionate ratio, succinate concentration, and abundance of family Christensenellaceae. Elemental Mg supplementation increased enteric CH emission, altered methanogen community with increased abundance of order Methanomassiliicoccales, 16S ribosomal RNA gene copies of methanogens, and order Methanobacteriales. In summary, the pulse of elevated dissolved H after feeding produced by elemental Mg inhibited rumen fermentation and feed digestibility by decreasing the abundance of carbohydrate-degrading bacteria, promoted H incorporation into succinate by increasing family Christensenellaceae and genus Bacteroidales_BS11, and increased H utilization for methanogenesis by favoring growth of methanogens.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In this study, effects of ferroferric oxide (FeO) on VFAs degradation and methanogenesis in sulfate-containing environment were investigated. Methanogenesis in reactors with or without sulfate were both favored through the addition of FeO. In reactors without sulfate, the dosage of FeO increased the maximum methane production rate by 21.7% accompanied with faster  and propionate degradation. Metagenomic analysis showed that FeO mainly promoted electron exchange between Mesotoga, Syntrophobacter, Smithella and Methanosaeta without altering the syntrophic patterns. However, in the sulfate-containing reactor with low methanogenic efficiency, syntrophic ethanol users and Methanosaeta were replaced by sulfate-reducing bacteria and Methanosarcina, respectively. The supplement of FeO re-enriched the syntrophic partners inhibited by sulfate and rebuilt a new syntrophic interaction with high efficiency similar to that in sulfate-free environment, leading to better methanogenic performance in sulfate-containing environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This review summarizes recent research results for dysregulated glucose metabolism of SCFAs, which could be initiated by gut microbiome of CRC. Moreover, the relationship between  transporters and glycolysis, which may correlate with the initiation and progression of CRC, are also discussed. Additionally, this review explores the linkage of BT to transport of SCFAs expressions between normal and cancerous colonocyte cell growth for tumorigenesis inhibition in CRC. Furthermore, the link between gut microbiota and SCFAs in the metabolism of CRC, in addition, the proteins and genes related to SCFAs-mediated signaling pathways, coupled with their correlation with the initiation and progression of CRC are also discussed. Therefore, targeting the  transporters to regulate lactate generation and export of BT, as well as applying SCFAs or gut microbiota and natural compounds for chemoprevention may be clinically useful for CRCs treatment. Future research should focus on the combination these therapeutic agents with metabolic inhibitors to effectively target the tumor SCFAs and regulate the bacterial ecology for activation of potent anticancer effect, which may provide more effective application prospect for CRC therapy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078978>Biogas upgrading and biochemical production from gas fermentation: Impact of microbial community and gas composition.</a></h2><p>The present study proposes a novel alternative method of the current biogas upgrading techniques by converting CO (in the biogas) into valuable chemicals (e.g., ) using H as energy source and acetogenic mixed culture as biocatalyst.

Xiexin Tang (XXT), a compound recipe composed of Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.), has been reported to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, but its mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study found that Xiexin Tang markedly ameliorated the composition of the gut microbiota, especially for some short chain   (SCFAs) producing bacteria, and then notably increased SCFAs production. However, the mechanism of XXT on the fermentation of gut bacteria and further improvement of obesity is not yet clear.This study aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of XXT on the amelioration of obesity.Here, high-fat diet-induced obese rat model was established to investigate the intervention efficacy following oral administration of XXT. Additionally, the expressions of key enzymes of gut microbe-derived SCFAs biosynthesis and key targets in the signaling pathway of energy metabolism were investigated by ELISA and qPCR analysis.Results showed that XXT could notably correct lipid metabolism disorders, alleviate systematic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Additionally, XXT could increase gut microbiota-derived SCFAs-producing capacity by enhancing mRNA levels and activities of -synthetic key enzymes such as  kinase (ACK), methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD), butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase (BUT) and butyrate kinase (BUK), which markedly decreased the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, elevated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and further lowered the energy charge (EC) in obese rats via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)/uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) signaling pathway. What's more, XXT could notably ameliorate dyslipidemia via increasing the gene expression of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.Taken together, our data provided a novel insight into the role of XXT in losing weight from energy metabolism regulation, which unraveled the molecular mechanism of XXT on the alleviation of dyslipidemia and fat heterotopic accumulation.

Cultivation experiments in a design-of-experiment approach revealed positive effects on methane production rate of increased ammonium levels (up to 0.2 M), temperature (up to 45 °C), and  concentrations (0.15-0.30 M). Molecular analyses and thermodynamic calculations demonstrated close interlinkages between the microorganisms, with available energies of -10 kJ/mol for  oxidation and -20 kJ/mol for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. The estimated generation time varied between 3 and 20 days for all syntrophic microorganisms involved, and the  minimum threshold level was 0.40-0.45 mM.

The charge-state distributions formed by nanoelectrospray ionization and tyrosine fluorescence emission data as a function of temperature from these solutions indicate that the folded form of RA-RNase A in solution is stabilized when ammonium  is replaced by increasing quantities of NaCl and Tris. Ion mobility data for the 7+ charge state of RA-RNase A indicates that the protein conformation in ammonium  changes with increasing concentration of NaCl which stablizes more compact structures. These results are consistent with observations reported 130 years ago by Hofmeister who found that ion identity can affect the stabilities and the structures of proteins in solution.

Twenty-four Holstein cows [130.3 ± 15.4 d in milk, and 30.8 ± 0.543 kg/d of milk yield (mean ± standard error)] were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment to evaluate the following treatments: control diet, without addition of ALG; and increasing levels of ALG [2, 4, and 6 g/kg of dry matter (DM)]. The ALG decreased DM intake and increased total-tract DM apparent digestibility. A tendency was observed for a quadratic effect on total-tract NDF digestibility by ALG inclusion, with peak value of the quadratic response at 4.13 g/kg of DM dose. Moreover, ALG increased ruminal pH and decreased  and total   acid concentrations. Fat-corrected milk and energy-corrected milk were quadratically affected, and a tendency for a milk yield effect was observed when ALG levels increased, whereas maximal yields were observed with intermediate doses. Milk fat, protein, and lactose concentrations were diminished, whereas productive efficiency was improved by the increase of ALG levels. Saturated  acid proportions were decreased, whereas polyunsaturated  acid proportions were increased when ALG was fed. There was low DHA transfer into milk; however, ALG inclusion decreased C18:0, C18:1 cis-9, C18:2 cis-9,12, and C18:3 cis-9,12,15 proportions, and increased C18:2 cis-9,trans-11, C18:1 trans-9, and C18:1 trans-11 proportions. Gross energy intake was decreased, whereas no effect was observed on digestible, metabolizable, or net energy intake. The ALG inclusion quadratically affected the microbial protein synthesis, with maximal enhancement at 3.24 g/kg of DM dose, and also increased serum cholesterol concentration. Under the conditions of this experiment, the inclusion of ALG in diets for mid-lactating dairy cows decreased feed intake and increased nutrient digestibility, improving productive efficiency and modifying milk  acid profile. Estimated intermediate doses (1.22 to 2.90 g/kg of DM) of DHA-rich ALG may be beneficial to milk, fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk yields, and is recommended for dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The cellobiohydrolase from Lentinula edodes (LeCel7A) was produced in Pichia pastoris. The optimal temperature and pH for LeCel7A were 60 °C and 5.0, respectively. The recombinant protein enhanced the hydrolysis of three straws. During in vitro rumen fermentation of three straws, the fiber digestibility, concentration of  and total , and fermentation liquid microbial protein were increased by LeCel7A. High throughput sequencing and real-time PCR data showed that the effects of LeCel7A on ruminal microbial community depended on the fermentation substrates. The relative abundances of Prevotellaceae_UCG_003 and Saccharofermentans were increased by LeCel7A regardless of agricultural straws. With rice straw, LeCel7A increased the relative abundances of Desulfovibrio, Ruminococcaceae and its some genus. With wheat straw, LeCel7A increased the relative abundances of Succiniclasticum, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus. With corn straw, Succiniclasticum, Christensenellaceae_R_7_group and Desulfovibrio were increased by LeCel7A. This study demonstrates that LeCel7A could enhance the hydrolysis and in vitro ruminal fermentation of agricultural straws, showing the potential of LeCel7A for improving the utilization of agricultural straws in ruminants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In in vitro experiment, the effects of different levels of WSB and CMB (0.5, 1, and 1.5% diet dry matter (DM)) on rumen fermentation characteristics were assessed in a completely randomized design with seven treatments and three replicates. Treatments were as follows: basal diet without biochar (control), basal diet with 0.5, 1, and 1.5% WSB, and basal diet with 0.5, 1, and 1.5% CMB. Addition of 1% WSB and 1.5% CMB to the diet linearly decreased methane production and ammonia-N concentrations and increased pH compared to control (P < 0.001). Inclusion of WSB and CMB to the diet did not change volume of gas production and total  (VFA) and proportion of , propionate, and butyrate. In the second experiment, six milking Kermanian ewes were used in a replicated Latin square design with three treatments and three 21-day periods to evaluate the effects of 1% WSB and 1.5% CMB (based on results obtained from in vitro trial) on intake, digestibility, and milk yield and composition. Dietary inclusion of 1% WSB and 1.5% CMB resulted in more milk yield (P < 0.01), milk protein (P < 0.05), and solids not fat (SNF) (P < 0.001). Blood glucose and total protein increased (P < 0.01) in ewes fed 1% WSB and 1.5% CMB in comparison to ewes fed control diet. Apparent digestibility coefficients of DM (P < 0.01) and OM (P < 0.10) were increased with inclusion of 1% WSB and 1.5% CMB in diet. Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility was also increased in WSB-fed ewes (P < 0.01). The lack of negative effects of 1% WSB and 1.5% CMB coupled with the observed reduction in methane emission and ammonia concentration and also improvement in milk production suggested that biochars can be beneficially incorporated in dairy ewes' ration as a low-cost feed additive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544530>The effects of age and dietary resistant starch on digestibility, fermentation end products in faeces and postprandial glucose and insulin responses of dogs.</a></h2><p>The same food formulation processed to obtain two different starch gelatinisations (SG) and resistant starch (RS) contents was evaluated in old and adult dogs, regarding apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients, fermentation products in faeces, and postprandial glucose and insulin responses. A diet with corn was ground and extruded in two different ways, obtaining Low RS (2.2 g/kg DM; 99.9% of SG) and High RS (15.3 g/kg DM; 62.6% of SG). Each diet was fed to adults (4.0 ± 0.7 years) or old beagle dogs (11.5 ± 0.4 years) in a 2 (ages) x 2 (RS amounts) factorial arrangement with 8 dogs per food. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance, and postprandial responses by analysis of variance of repeated measurements over time ( < 0.05). Diet × age interaction was observed for protein ATTD, with lower values for old dogs fed High RS than those for the other treatments ( < 0.05). No age or diet effect was verified for the ATTD of other nutrients and faecal score. Faecal moisture and pH were higher for adults than that for old dogs ( < 0.05). The High RS food increased , propionate and butyrate concentrations in faeces, regardless of age ( < 0.01). Old dogs presented lower  and total short-chain   () and higher lactate and ammonia than adults ( < 0.05). Only for old dogs the intake of the High RS food reduced ammonia and increased faecal lactate ( < 0.05). An age × diet interaction was verified for glucose postprandial response, with lower values for old dogs fed High RS food ( < 0.05), while no differences were found for the other treatments. Old dogs had higher postprandial insulin secretion regardless of the diet ( < 0.05), and lower insulin increment at 180 min after the meal when fed the Low RS than when fed the High RS food ( < 0.05). In conclusion, the diet with lower SG and higher RS improved the intestinal microenvironment, with higher butyrate and total  without altering faeces production or score. Old dogs presented less  and total  and higher lactate and ammonia in faeces than adults. The High RS food increased lactate and reduced ammonia in faeces of old dogs, with possible positive influences for gut health. Old dogs had higher postprandial insulin secretion than that of adults to maintain blood glucose, and the diet with higher RS content reduced the postprandial glucose response of old dogs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661720>Changes of gut microbiota during silybin mediated treatment of high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic  liver diseasein mouse.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota involved in pathogenesis of nonalcoholic  liver disease (NAFLD).

This study applied Ca in various forms (Ca  and CaCl ) and concentrations to reduce cadmium (Cd) concentration in rice and propose a possible mechanism through which Ca acts to control the Cd concentration in rice. The results showed that supplementation of Cd-contaminated soil with Ca  reduced the Cd concentration in rice after exposure for 7 days in both hydroponic and soil conditions. The possible involvement of the auto-inhibited Ca -ATPase gene (ACA) might act to control the primary signal of the Cd stress response. The messages from ACA3 and ACA13 tended to up-regulate the low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) and down-regulate Cd uptake and the Cd translocation transporter, including the genes, natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 5 (Nramp5) and Zn/Cd-transporting ATPase 2 (HMA2), which resulted in a reduction in the Cd concentration in rice. After cultivation for 120 days, the application of Ca  into Cd-contaminated soil inhibited Cd uptake of rice.

Enterococcal infections, mainly caused by Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, include apical periodontitis, endocarditis, and bloodstream infections. Recently, vancomycinresistant Enterococci are considered major pathogens that are common but difficult to treat, especially in nosocomial settings. Moreover, E. faecalis is closely associated with recurrent endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-chain   (SCFAs), , propionate, and butyrate, which are metabolites fermented by gut microbiota, on the growth of Enterococci. Enterococci were cultured in the presence or absence of , propionate, or butyrate, and the optical density at 600 nm was measured to determine bacterial growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration test was conducted. Bacteria were treated with a , together with clinically used endodontic treatment methods such as triple antibiotics (metronidazole, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) to determine the effects of combination treatment. Of the SCFAs, propionate had a bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of E. faecalis in a dose-dependent manner and also that of clinical strains of E. faecalis isolated from dental plaques. Meanwhile,  and butyrate had minimal effects on E. faecalis growth. Moreover, propionate inhibited the growth of other Enterococci including E. faecium. In addition, combination treatment of propionate and triple antibiotics led to further growth inhibition, whereas no cooperative effect was observed at propionate plus CHX. These results indicate that propionate attenuates the growth of Enterococci, suggesting propionate as a potential agent to control Enterococcal infections, especially when combined with triple antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839131>Modified anaerobic digestion model No.1 (ADM1) for modeling anaerobic digestion process at different ammonium concentrations.</a></h2><p>Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an established method for sustainable energy production. Anaerobic digestion model No.1 (ADM1) was used to simulate methane production (MP) and   acid (VFA) concentrations at different ammonium concentrations. In accordance with the incomplete description of several biochemical reactions and the omission of several reaction processes, ADM1 was modified with the consideration of acetic acid inhibition and valeric acid existence. ADM1_ac (ADM1 added acetic acid inhibition) could obtain better simulation accuracy of MP (goodness-of-fit value = 0.945), and VFA concentrations (goodness-of-fit values > 0.39) were all higher than ADM1_original, but cannot explain the valeric acid production.

Several studies have also proposed that subacute ruminal acidosis in mature cows is a risk factor for various metabolic disorders and production diseases. In this study, we examined the effects of forage feeding on ruminal pH, ruminal fermentation, rumen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration, plasma metabolites, and hormonal concentrations in calves during pre- and postweaning periods. Sixteen male Holstein calves were used. At 7 wk of age, calves were randomly assigned to one of two dietary treatments: calves in the HAY group (n = 8) were fed starter with forage, and those in the CON group (n = 8) were fed starter without any forage. All calves were weaned at 8 wk of age. The amounts of starter and mixed hay were gradually increased until the end of the experiment (age, 11 wk). Ruminal pH was measured continuously every 10 min using an indwelling sensor. Rumen fluid and peripheral blood samples were obtained prior to morning feedings at -1, 0, 1, and 3 wk after weaning. Compared with the HAY group, in the CON group, the average daily ruminal pH was lower (P < 0.05) and the duration of ruminal pH values below 5.6 was longer (P < 0.05). Regarding ruminal VFA profiles, compared with the HAY group, the CON group had lower (P < 0.05)  to propionate ratios at 1 and 3 wk after weaning. Rumen LPS concentrations tended to be higher (P < 0.1) in the CON group than in the HAY group; however, concentrations of LPS-binding protein, haptoglobin, and serum amyloid A in the peripheral blood did not differ significantly. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels were markedly higher (P < 0.05) in the CON group than in the HAY group at 1 and 3 wk after weaning. There was a linear decrease in plasma growth hormone (GH) levels in the CON group after the start of the experiment, and its concentrations were lower (P < 0.05) in the CON group than in the HAY group at 0 and 3 wk after weaning. The results indicated that forage provision during pre- and postweaning periods helped prevent decrease in ruminal pH, change in ruminal fermentation, and liver alteration, and helped maintain plasma GH levels, which suggests that calves around the time of weaning need forage intake with starter to maintain proper metabolic and hormonal functions.© The Author(s) 2019.

Dragon fruit (Hylocereus undatus) peel powder (DFPP) contains both CT and SP. The current study aimed to investigate the influence of DFPP and varying levels of concentrate and roughage ratios on gas production kinetics, nutrient degradability, and methane production "using in vitro gas production technique." The dietary treatments were arranged according to a 3 × 5 Factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design. The two experimental factors consisted of the roughage to concentrate (R:C) ratio (100:0, 70:30, and 30:70) and the levels of DFPP supplementation (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4% of the substrate) on DM basis. The results revealed that the R:C ratio at 30:70 had the highest cumulative gas production when compared to other ratios (P < 0.01). The in vitro true dry matter degradability at 12 and 24 h was affected by R:C ratio (P < 0.01). Furthermore,  (VFA) and propionate (C3) were significantly increased by the levels of DFPP, while  (C2) and C2:C3 ratios were decreased (P < 0.05). The rumen protozoal population was significantly decreased by DFPP supplementation (P < 0.05). Rumen methane production was significantly impacted by R:C ratios and decreased when the level of DFPP increased (P < 0.01), while NH-N and ruminal pH were not influenced by the DFPP supplement. It could be summarized that supplementation of DFPP resulted in improved rumen fermentation kinetics and could be used as a dietary source to mitigate rumen methane production, hence reducing greenhouse gas production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339080>African walnut (Tetracarpidium conophorum) modulates hepatic lipid accumulation in obesity via reciprocal actions on HMG-CoA reductase and paraoxonase.</a></h2><p>Obesity is characterized by increased body fat and involves an imbalance between synthesis and degradation of lipids.To investigate the effect of African walnuts (Tetracarpidium conophorum) on storage lipids and the regulatory enzymes of hepatic lipid metabolism in obese rats.The nuts were extracted in ethanol (WE) and further separated to obtain the ethyl- fraction (ET) and the residue (RES). These were administered orally to 3 groups of monosodium glutamate-obese rats (n = 6), respectively, for 6 weeks. Other groups in the study were the normal (NC), obese control (OC) and standard control (SC) which received orlistat. Hepatic total lipids, total phospholipids, triacylglycerol (TG), total cholesterol (TCHOL), 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase and paraoxonase were studied.Total lipids, TG and TCHOL which increased in OC compared to NC group, were decreased. HMG-CoA reductase activity decreased in the 3 study groups relative to OC. Paraoxonase activity which decreased in OC, was up-regulated, while the magnitude of hepatic cholesterol decreased from 94.32 % in OC to 52.19, 65.43 and 47.04 % with WE, ET and RES, respectively. Flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, tannins and saponins were detected in the nut. GC-MS analysis revealed 16, 18 and 10  components in WE, ET and RES, respectively. Unsaturated   (linolenic : 33.33, 47.95 and 50.93 %, and α-linolenic : 25, 19.66 and 26.63 %) in WE, ET and RES, respectively, being most abundant, and likely responsible for the observed activity.African walnuts can prevent hepatic lipid accumulation through reciprocal actions on HMG-CoA reductase and paraoxonase in obesity.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31207344>Lactobacillus sp. improved microbiota and metabolite profiles of aging rats.</a></h2><p>Aging is closely associated with altered gut function and composition, in which elderly were reported with reduced gut microbiota diversity and increased incidence of age-related diseases. Probiotics have been shown to exert beneficial health-promoting effects through modulation of intestinal microflora biodiversity, thus the effects of probiotics administration on D-galactose (D-gal) senescence-induced rat were evaluated based on the changes in gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles. Upon senescence induction, the ratio of Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes was significantly lowered, while treatment with Lactobacillus helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 increased the ratio at the phylum level (P < 0.05). Study on the genus level showed that L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 administration reduced Bacteroides, which are prominently opportunistic pathogens while L. fermentum DR9 treated rats promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus compared to the aged rats (P < 0.05). Probiotics treatment did not alter fecal short-chain  acid () profile, but an increase in  was observed in the D-gal rats. The analysis of fecal water-soluble metabolites showed that D-gal induced senescence caused great impact on amino  metabolism such as urocanic acid, citrulline, cystamine and 5-oxoproline, which could serve as potential aging biomarkers. Treatment with probiotics ameliorated these metabolites in a strain-specific manner, whereby L. fermentum DR9 promoted antioxidative effect through upregulation of oxoproline, whereas both L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 restored the levels of reducing sugars, arabinose and ribose similar to the young rats. D-gal induced senescence did cause significant immunological alteration in the colon of aged rats however, all probiotic strains demonstrated immunomodulatory properties as L. paracasei OFS 0291, L. helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 alleviated proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-1β as well as IL-4 compared to the aged control (P < 0.05).

They are regarded as semi-porous substrates, and yet can be critical to analyze when looking for latent fingermarks due to their thermosensibility. The aim of this study was to investigate a development sequence that would better combine the adequate detection techniques in order to maximize the chances to develop latent fingermarks left on these substrates. Different methods of development have been compared on test substrates: black magnetic powder, Lumicyano™, thermal development, ninhydrin and 1,2-indanedione/ZnCl. Whitening stages and thermal development have been focused on, tested and optimized. The results of these preliminary tests enabled the study of three development sequences.

The effect of particle size on hemicellulose recovery upon pretreatment was studied using 1 and 2 M NaOH. It was observed that particle size significantly influences hemicellulose recovery, as particles below 120 µm resulted in near complete recovery at 2 M NaOH. Enzymatic hydrolysis of hemicellulose was optimised using response surface methodology, to obtain efficient xylooligosaccharides production at low enzyme dose and high substrate concentration. For higher XOS yield, an enzyme dose of 10 U and substrate concentration <2% was optimal. The in-vitro human faecal fermentation study revealed no significant difference in gas and short chain  acid level among substrates evaluated.

The biofilms released increasing amounts of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) with a higher compositional diversity and stronger Cu(II) complexation, compared to the plankton cells, at higher Cu(II) concentrations (up to 80 mg/L) and circuital currents (cathodic potential of -900 mV vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)). Moreover, the biofilms reduced Cu(II) to Cu(0) more effectively than the plankton cells. At Cu(II) concentrations below 80 mg/L, the dehydrogenase activity in the biofilms was higher than in the plankton cells, and increased with circuital current, which was converse to the lower activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and antioxidative glutathione (GSH) in the biofilms than the plankton cells, although all these physiological activities were positively correlated with the concentration of Cu(II). This is the first study that evaluates the EPS constituents and the physiological activities of the biofilms and the plankton cells in the MESs, that favors the production of  from CO sequestration and the simultaneous reduction of Cu(II) from organics-barren waters contaminated with heavy metals.Copyright © 2019.

We investigated the persistence of differences in CH emission between groups of cows categorized as either low or high emitters over a 5-mo period. Two feeding regimens (pasture vs. indoors) were used. Early- to mid-lactation Holstein Friesian cows were categorized as low or high emitters (n = 10 each) retrospectively, using predictions from milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectra, before the start of the experiment. Data from MIR estimates and from measurements with the GreenFeed (GF; C-Lock Technology Inc., Rapid City, SD) system over the 5-mo experiment were combined into 7-, 14-, and 28-d periods. Feed intake, eating and ruminating behavior, and ruminal fluid traits were determined in two 7-d measurement periods in the grazing season. The CH emission data were analyzed using a split-plot ANOVA, and the repeatability of each of the applied methods for determining CH emission was calculated. Traits other than CH emission were analyzed for differences between low and high emitters using a linear mixed model. The initial category-dependent differences in daily CH production persisted over the subsequent 5 mo and across 2 feeding regimens with both methods. The repeatability analysis indicated that the biweekly milk control scheme, and even a monthly scheme as practiced on farms, might be sufficient for confirming category differences. However, the relationship between CH data estimated by MIR and measured with GF for individual cows was weak (R = 0.26). The categorization based on CH production also generated differences in CH emission per kilogram of milk; differentiation between cow categories was not persistent based on milk MIR spectra and GF. Compared with the high emitters, low emitters tended to show a lower -to-propionate ratio in ruminal , whereas feed intake and ruminating time did not differ. Interestingly, the low emitters spent less time eating than the high emitters. In conclusion, the CH estimation from analyzing the milk MIR spectra is an appropriate proxy to form and regularly control categories of cows with different CH production levels. The categorization was also sufficient to secure similar and persistent differences in emission intensity when estimated by MIR spectra of the milk. Further studies are needed to determine whether MIR data from individual cows are sufficiently accurate for breeding.The Authors.

However, low concentrations of VFAs in water have prevented their commercial production, even with modern separation technologies, due to the high operating costs. We have applied newly developed solvents, selected by chemical structure similarity, to the separation of five different VFAs.Since most of the water was separated by extraction using hexyl  and nonyl , the utilities necessary for solvent recovery and product purification were a fraction of those required by the existing VFAs' separation processes. The solvents separated almost all the water in the feed at the extraction stage, consuming no energy. The energy use in this study is only 34% of the lowest case use among various processes of either distillation-only or combined extraction-distillation.The performance evaluation of the proposed VFAs separation process showed that product recovery was 99% and acid purity was 99.5% with eco-scores of 70% lower than those of the current processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570035>Bioengineering of anaerobic digestion for , hydrogen or methane production: A critical review.</a></h2><p>Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a well-established technology used for producing biogas or biomethane alongside the slurry used as biofertilizer. However, using a variety of wastes and residuals as substrate and mixed cultures in the bioreactor makes AD as one of the most complicated biochemical processes employing hydrolytic, acidogenic, hydrogen-producing, -forming bacteria as well as acetoclastic and hydrogenoclastic methanogens. Hydrogen and  (VFAs) including acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, valeric and caproic acid and other carboxylic  such as succinic and lactic  are formed as intermediate products. As these  are important precursors for various industries as mixed or purified chemicals, the AD process can be bioengineered to produce VFAs alongside hydrogen and therefore biogas plants can become biorefineries. The current review paper provides the theory and means to produce and accumulate VFAs and hydrogen, inhibit their conversion to methane and to extract them as the final products. The effects of pretreatment, pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time (HRT), organic loading rate (OLR), chemical methane inhibitions, and heat shocking of the inoculum on VFAs accumulation, hydrogen production, VFAs composition, and the microbial community were discussed. Furthermore, this paper highlights the possible techniques for recovery of VFAs from the fermentation media in order to minimize product inhibition as well as to supply the carboxylates for downstream procedures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30931087>Metabolic activity of intestinal microflora in patients with bronchial asthma.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota plays the important role to support the immunological tolerance.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups that were fed an AIN-93G-based diet that contained 5% fiber provided by cellulose (control), BM or BG. Four weeks after starting the respective diets, the animals were sacrificed and digesta from the cecum, proximal colon and distal colon were collected and the  concentrations were quantified. Microbiota in the cecal and distal colonic digesta were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The concentrations of  and n-butyrate in cecal digesta were significantly higher in the BM and BG groups than in the control group, whereas the concentration of total SCFAs in cecal digesta was significantly higher only in the BM group than in the control group. The concentrations of  and total SCFAs in the distal colonic digesta were significantly higher only in the BM group than in the control group. The abundance of Bacteroidetes in cecal digesta was significantly higher in the BM group than in the control group. In contrast, the abundance of Firmicutes in cecal digesta was significantly lower in the BM and BG groups than in the control group. These results indicated that BM increased the concentration of total SCFAs in the distal colonic digesta. These changes might have been caused by fructan and resistant starch in addition to β-glucan. In conclusion, fermentable fibers in BM reached the distal colon and modified the microbiota, leading to an increase in the concentration of total SCFAs in the distal colonic digesta, more effectively compared with the high-β-glucan barley line (BG).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810289>Short-chain  acid delivery: assessing exogenous administration of the microbiome metabolite  in mice.</a></h2><p>Short-chain   (SCFAs) are fermentation by-products of gut microbes which have been linked to positive effects on host physiology; the most abundant  is .

The objectives of this study were to investigate the antioral cancer ability of ethyl  extract of  (EANV). The preferential killing ability of EANV was determined by MTS-based cell viability assays. The bioactive effects were further screened by flow cytometry for apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. At 24 h treatment, EANV dose dependently decreased six types of oral cancer cells, but the normal oral cells (HGF-1) kept a 90% viability. EANV also showed chronic antiproliferative effects and inhibited 3D sphere formation ability of oral cancer cells. Ca9-22 and CAL 27 oral cancer cells with high response to EANV increased subG1 populations and enhanced Annexin V- and pancaspase-detected apoptosis in these cells. EANV also induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide and the dysfunction of mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, the oxidative DNA damage level such as 8-oxo-2'deoxyguanosine was increased in EANV-treated oral cancer cells. Taken together, EANV has a preferential killing effect against oral cancer cells associated with oxidative stress, apoptosis, and DNA damage, suggesting EANV as a potential antioral cancer agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31196587>Separation of deamidated peptides with mixed-mode chromatography using phospholipid-functionalized monolithic stationary phases.</a></h2><p>Deamidation of asparagine (Asn) residues of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) plays a pivotal role in the in vivo/vitro degradation or efficacy loss of biopharmaceuticals. However, a major challenge for MS analysis of deamidation of Asn-containing peptides in mAbs, is due to the fact that there is only a 1 Da mass shift between the native form (Asn residues) and deamidated forms (n-aspartyl (n-Asp) and isoaspartyl (isoAsp) residues with identical mass). Therefore, a chromatographic separation of the deamidated proteins and/or the peptides derived therefrom is needed prior to MS analysis. In this study, the monolithic column with various stationary phases, including reverse phase (RP), single phospholipid-functionalized and mixed phospholipid-functionalized monoliths, were prepared for the separation of the deamidation-sensitive signature peptide (IYPTNGYTR) of trastuzumab and its two deamidated products, n-Asp55 residue IYPTDGYTR and isoAsp55 residue IYPTisoDGYTR. Compared to the RP monolith, the phospholipid-functionalized monoliths provided mixed-mode interactions and exhibited better peak shape and separation selectivity. The effect of the parameters, including the type and concentration of buffer, temperature and pH value on the separation performance were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the three peptides were fully separated on a mixed phosphocholine (PC) / phosphatidic acid (PA) functionalized monolith (poly (MDPCPA-co-EDMA)) due to the joint contribution of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Therefore, the novel method based on the mixed phospholipids-functionalized monolithic column exhibited good potential for the analysis of deamidated peptides, which will be useful for the in-depth study of post-translational modifications of mAbs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 20 newborn male Holstein calves (3 d of age; 40.3 ± 1.30 kg of body weight; ±SE) were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 treatments, a starter feed containing either 10% dry (AH) or reconstituted alfalfa hay (RAH), each consisting of 10 calves. Alfalfa hay was reconstituted with water 24 h before feeding to achieve a theoretical dry matter content of 20%. Both starter feeds had the same ingredients and nutrient compositions but differed in their dry matter content (91.2 and 83.8% dry matter for AH and RAH, respectively). Calves were weaned on d 50 and remained on the study until d 70. All calves had free access to fresh and clean drinking water and the starter feed at all times. During the study period, the average maximum temperature-humidity index was 73.8 units, indicating no degree of environmental heat load for dairy calves. Starter feed dry matter intake, total dry matter intake, and body weight (at weaning and at the end of the trial) were unaffected by treatment. Nutrient intake (except for total ether extract intake) increased during the postweaning period compared with the preweaning period. Average daily gain and feed efficiency were unchanged between treatments. Calves had higher average daily gain and skeletal growth during the postweaning period; however, feed efficiency was lower during the post- versus preweaning period. Calves fed RAH gained more hip width and body barrel compared with calves fed AH during the preweaning and all studied periods, respectively. Rectal temperature was similar between treatments, but feeding RAH decreased fecal score and general appearance score during the preweaning period. Apparent total-tract nutrient digestibility was not affected by reconstitution of alfalfa hay; however, reconstitution increased total-tract digestibility of neutral detergent fiber during the postweaning period. Ruminal fluid pH, and concentrations and profile of total  were unchanged between treatments. Molar concentration of propionate and  to propionate ratio increased and decreased, respectively, during the postweaning period. Reconstitution of alfalfa hay did not affect concentrations of glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate, blood urea N, and albumin, and albumin to globulin ratio during the studied periods; however, reconstitution increased concentration of blood total protein during the overall period. Calves had higher concentrations of blood glucose and globulin during the preweaning and β-hydroxybutyrate during the postweaning period. Overall, reconstitution of alfalfa hay did not interact with calf phase (pre- vs. postweaning) to affect dry matter intake, growth performance, and metabolic indications of rumen development (measured as ruminal  and selected blood metabolites), but improved health-related variables (fecal score and general appearance score) during the preweaning period.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

A Rusitec experiment was conducted in 2 identical runs using a complete randomized design with 3 replicates per treatment resulting in total of 6 treatment combinations (n = 6). Each run lasted 12 d with sampling occurring in the last 5 d. Diets were a standard dairy ration (60:40; concentrate:forage) supplemented with one of 3 different plant-based combinations (PI, PII, and PIII) at a level of 100 mg/l and a non-supplemented control (basal diet, control). Microbial DNA samples were taken on the last day of each run and the 16S rRNA target gene sequenced using Illumina MiSeq technology. The supplementations had no effect on the pH, methane and carbon dioxide production. However, both total  (P = 0.08) and molar concentrations of  (P = 0.06) tended to be increased in the treatment groups in comparison to control, with PII having the highest overall values (102.7 mmol/L and 43.3 mmol/L, respectively). Alpha diversity indices Shannon, Simpson and Chao1 showed no effect of supplementations or combinations. The addition of PII increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes compared to all other treatments (P = 0.05). Supplementation with plant-based combinations reduced the relative abundance of Pyramidobacter from the family Dethiosulfovibrionaceae in comparison with the control diet (P = 0.05). Evaluation of predicted gene function through PICRUSt analysis showed variation in predicted cellular function and metabolism between bacterial communities supplemented with plant-based combinations compared to the control diet. This shows that the addition of plant-based combinations can have the potential to modulate the metabolic function of rumen microbes, and likely the production of small-sized rumen metabolites, without disrupting the rumen microbial community structure and diversity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In winemaking, it is associated with off-flavours that cause wine spoilage, while in bioethanol production this yeast is linked to a reduction of industrial productivity by competing with Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the substrate. In spite of that, this point of view is gradually changing, mostly because D. bruxellensis is also able to produce important metabolites, such as ethanol, , fusel alcohols, esters and others. This dual role is likely due to the fact that this yeast presents a set of metabolic traits that might be either industrially attractive or detrimental, depending on how they are faced and explored. Therefore, a proper industrial application for D. bruxellensis depends on the correct assembly of its central metabolic puzzle. In this sense, researchers have addressed issues regarding the physiological and genetic aspects of D. bruxellensis, which have brought to light much of our current knowledge on this yeast. In this review, we shall outline what is presently understood about the main metabolic features of D. bruxellensis and how they might be managed to improve its current or future industrial applications (except for winemaking, in which it is solely regarded as a contaminant). Moreover, we will discuss the advantages and challenges that must be overcome in order to take advantage of the full biotechnological potential of this yeast.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31158775>Response of the microbial community to the methanogenic performance of biologically hydrolyzed sewage sludge with variable hydraulic retention times.</a></h2><p>Hyperthermophilic biological hydrolysis of sewage sludge was applied before long-term anaerobic digestion to investigate how shortening hydraulic retention times (HRT, 20-5d) affected methanogenic performances and microbial dynamics. Results indicated that although the three different HRTs provided a stable process with a steady-state of methane production, both methane yield (161 L kg-VS 25% higher) and  solids removal (VS, 50%, 2-fold higher) increased during longer HRTs. Redundancy analysis results indicated that Sporosarcina and Methnosarcina positively correlated to VS removal and methane yield, and negatively correlated to  (VFAs) accumulation. The relative abundance of Coprothermobacter (>60%), syntrophic  oxidation bacteria (SAOB), and Methanospirillum (8-15%), increased during shorter HRTs. A slight shift to two-stage  conversion was observed during shorter HRTs. The results demonstrated that HRTs played a key role in shaping microbial structure, leading to a new steady-state of microbial community profiles and process performances at variable HRTs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We selected studies that provided data on  levels or fecal microbiota abundance in obese and nonobese individuals and then combined the published estimates using a random-effects meta-analysis. Obese individuals had significantly higher fecal concentrations of  (SMD (standardized mean differences) = 0.87, 95% CI (confidence interva) = 0.24-1.50,  (-squared) = 88.5), propionate (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.35-1.36,  = 82.3%), and butyrate (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.29-1.27,  = 81.7%) than nonobese controls. The subgroup analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity among obese individuals with a BMI >30 kg/m ( = 0.0%). At the phylum level, the abundance of fecal microbiota was reduced in obese compared to nonobese individuals, but the difference was not statistically significant (Bacteroidetes phylum, SMD = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.73-0.01; Firmicutes phylum, SMD = -0.10, 95% CI = -0.31-0.10). The currently available human case-control studies show that obesity is associated with high levels of  but not gut microbiota richness at the phylum level. Additional well-designed studies with a considerable sample size are needed to clarify whether this association is causal, but it is also necessary to identify additional contributors to  production, absorption, and excretion in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311119>Early Feeding Regime of Waste Milk, Milk, and Milk Replacer for Calves Has Different Effects on Rumen Fermentation and the Bacterial Community.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effects of different types of early feeding on rumen fermentation parameters and the bacterial community in calves. Fifty-four Holstein calves were assigned to three treatments and fed whole milk (M), pasteurized waste milk (WM), or milk replacer (MR). Male calves were slaughtered at the age of two months to measure the stomach masses. The female calves were followed for six months to determine the body weight, blood indices, rumen fermentation, and ruminal bacterial community. At the age of two months, the average daily gain was lower, but the concentration of total  was greater in the MR group. Starter intake and stomach mass were lower, but the isovalerate molar proportion was greater in the WM group. The blood indices and ruminal bacterial community of the WM group differed from those of the other groups. At the age of six months, the ruminal propionate molar proportion was lower, but the ruminal pH and /propionate ratio were greater in the MR group. In conclusion, calves fed WM had different rumen fermentation and bacterial community during the weaning period, whereas feeding MR produced a long-lasting effect on the rumen environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982063>Screening of single or combined administration of 9 probiotics to reduce ammonia emissions from laying hens.</a></h2><p>The effects of single/combined administration of 9 probiotics on ammonia (NH3) emissions during in vitro fermentation of the caecal contents of laying hens were studied. Not all of the probiotics reduced NH3 emissions. Pichia farinose, Bacillus coagulans, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pichia guilliermondii, and Bacillus subtilis reduced NH3 production by approximately 35.1 to 39%. Compared with the control group, the greatest NH3 inhibition was achieved via the combined application of P. guilliermondii, B. subtilis, and L. plantarum at 1:2:1, resulting in a 46% reduction. Effective probiotics use decreased crude protein digestibility, pH, ammonium nitrogen, valerate levels, and urease and uricase activity, but increased urea, purine trione, nitrate nitrogen, total , and  levels. The relative abundance of the bacteria responsible for fermenting carbohydrates to produce short   was increased. Under different treatments, the KEGG Orthology (KO) metabolic pathways of NH3 production and utilization were diverse. Hence, the application of probiotics to control NH3 emissions is dependent on the types and combined ratio of the organisms involved.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203938>Characteristics of two-phase mesophilic anaerobic digestion of co-substrates consisting of waste activated sludge and corn silage based on modified ADM1.</a></h2><p>Two-phase anaerobic digestion of co-substrates is a promising process to alleviate environmental pollution, product valuable methane gas and renew energy. A modified anaerobic digestion model No. 1 (ADM1) was proposed to characterize the mesophilic two-phase anaerobic digestion at the feedstock ratios of waste activated sludge to corn silage 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, respectively. The sensitivity analysis of the modified ADM1 was operated on the platform AQUASIM 2.0 while the kinetic parameter estimation and simulation was implemented on the platform MATLAB 7.0. The Monod maximum specific uptake rate for  (k) was calibrated to 29.0 d, and the half-saturation value for  (k) 0.40 kgCOD/m in the acidification phase while k 35.0 d, Monod maximum specific uptake rate for hydrogen (k) 23.0 d and k 0.70 kgCOD/m in the methanogenic phase in the modified ADM1. The results from the batch tests showed the optimal feedstock ratio of waste activated sludge to corn silage was 2:1. Under this condition, chemical oxygen demand could reach the largest removal at around 51.0%, while Ammonia-nitrogen and total phosphorous increased by the maximal 192.0% and 71.5%. Besides, volatile fatty acids were lowest at about 0.27 kgCOD/m, and the biogas flow was highest at about 47.6 mL/d. The pH values were always maintained at 6.8-7.2. Good agreements could be achieved between the measured data and the simulation with the modified ADM1. Therefore, the optimal and preferable operating factors during two-phase anaerobic digestion of co-substrates could be obtained from the simulation. The modified model will contribute to further investigating and predicting the characteristics of the process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These individual polysaccharides have previously been shown to favorably alter the gut microbiota composition and activity albeit the effect of the collective brown seaweed fiber component on the microbiota remains to be determined.This study investigated the effect of a crude polysaccharide-rich extract obtained from Laminaria digitata (CE) and a depolymerized CE extract (DE) on the gut microbiota composition and metabolism using an in vitro fecal batch culture model though metagenomic compositional analysis using 16S rRNA FLX amplicon pyrosequencing and short-chain  acid () analysis using GC-FID.Selective culture analysis showed no significant changes in cultured lactobacilli or bifidobacteria between the CE or DE and the cellulose-negative control at any time point measured (0, 5, 10, 24, 36, 48 h). Following metagenomic analysis, the CE and DE significantly altered the relative abundance of several families including Lachnospiraceae and genera including Streptococcus, Ruminococcus and Parabacteroides of human fecal bacterial populations in comparison to cellulose after 24 h. The concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and total  were significantly higher for both the CE and DE compared to cellulose after 10, 24, 36 and 48 h fermentation (p < 0.05).

The majority of studies evaluating mycoprotein focus on the protein content and very few consider the fibre content. Fibre consumption is also associated with decreased energy intake, which is partly attributed to short chain   (SCFAs) from fibre fermentation by colonic bacteria. To study the -producing capability of mycoprotein, in vitro batch fermentations were conducted, and  production compared with that from extracted mycoprotein fibre, oligofructose (OF), rhamnose, and laminarin. Mycoprotein and mycoprotein fibre were both fermentable, resulting in a total  production of 24.9 (1.7) and 61.2 (15.7) mmol/L, respectively. OF led to a significantly higher proportion of  compared to all other substrates tested (92.6 (2.8)%,  < 0.01). Rhamnose generated the highest proportion of propionate (45.3 (2.0)%,  < 0.01), although mycoprotein and mycoprotein fibre yielded a higher proportion of propionate compared with OF and laminarin. Butyrate proportion was the highest with laminarin (28.0 (10.0)although mycoprotein fibre led to a significantly higher proportion than OF ( < 0.01).

Ten Japanese Black fattening steers (aged 26 months) were randomly divided into control and KP groups. The control group (n = 5) was fed concentrate feed without KP, and the KP group (n = 5) was fed concentrate feed containing 10% KP. Both the groups were provided rice straw as roughage. The experiment was conducted over a period of 12 weeks. There was no significant difference in dry matter intake, daily body weight gain, and nutrient digestibility between both groups. No difference was observed in the ruminal concentrations of  among the groups. At weeks 8 and 12 after the onset of the experiment, the -to-propionate ratio in the ruminal fluid of the KP group was significantly higher than that of the control group. The average daily pH of ruminal fluid and activity of ruminal lipopolysaccharide did not differ between the groups. Our results suggested that the growth performance and feed digestibility in the Japanese Black fattening steers were not influenced by replacing concentrate feed with KP.© 2019 The Authors.

Recombinant tissue plasminogen remains the only effective treatment but limited as therapy must commence soon after the onset of symptoms.We investigated whether , which modulates many pathways including inflammation, may attenuate brain injury in stroke. As  has a short blood half-life and high amounts irritate the gastrointestinal tract,  was administered encapsulated in a liposomal nanoparticle (liposomal-encapsulated , LITA).Transient ischemia was induced by 90 mins middle-cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in Sprague-Dawley rats, and LITA or control liposomes given intraperitoneally at occlusion and daily for up to two weeks post-MCAO. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to estimate lesion volume at 24 h, 1 and 2 weeks post-MCAO and anterior lateral ventricular volume (ALVv) at 2 weeks post-MCAO. Locomotive behaviour was tested prior to the final MRI scan. After the final scan, brains were collected, and immunohistochemistry was performed.Lesion volumes were decreased by ~80% from 24 h to one-week post-MCAO, in both control and LITA groups (⩽0.05). However, the lesion was increased by ~50% over the subsequent 1 to 2 weeks after MCAO in the control group (from 24.1±10.0 to 58.7±28.6 mm; ⩽0.05) but remained unchanged in the LITA group. ALVv were also attenuated by LITA treatment at 2 weeks post-MCAO (177.2±11.9% and 135.3±10.9% of contralateral ALVv for control and LITA groups, respectively; ⩽0.05). LITA-treated animals also appeared to have improved motor activity, moving with greater average velocity than control animals. Microglial immunoreactivity was ~40% lower in the LITA group compared to the control group (⩽0.05), but LITA did not modulate neurogenesis, apoptosis, histone acetylation and lipid peroxidation.LITA appears to attenuate the harmful chronic neuroinflammation observed during brain remodeling after a focal ischemic insult.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244078> Production from Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane via Intracellular Storage Compounds.</a></h2><p>There is great interest in microbial conversion of methane, an abundant resource, into valuable liquid chemicals. While aerobic bioconversion of methane to liquid chemicals has been reported, studies of anaerobic methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals are rare. Here we show that a microbial culture dominated by Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens', an anaerobic methanotrophic archaeon, anaerobically oxidizes methane to produce , indirectly via reaction intermediate(s), when nitrate or nitrite is supplied as an electron acceptor under a rate-limiting condition. Isotopic labeling tests showed that  was produced from certain intracellular storage compounds that originated from methane.

Since antibiotic exposure can adversely affect the microbiome, we hypothesized that antibiotic effects on the gut microbiota and host metabolism are sex dependent. In this study, we examined the effects of antibiotic treatments, including vancomycin (Vanc) and ciprofloxacin-metronidazole (CiMe), on the gut microbiome and metabolome in colonic contents and tissues in both male and female mice. We found that the relative abundances and structural composition of  were significantly reduced in female mice after both Vanc and CiMe treatments but in male mice only after treatment with Vanc. However, Vanc exposure considerably altered the relative abundances and structural composition of representatives of the  especially in male mice. The levels of short-chain   (SCFAs; , butyrate, and propionate) in colonic contents and tissues were significantly decreased in female mice after both antibiotic treatments, while these reductions were detected in male mice only after Vanc treatment. However, another , formate, exhibited the opposite tendency in colonic tissues. Both antibiotic exposures significantly decreased the levels of alanine, branched-chain amino  (BCAAs; leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and aromatic amino  (AAAs; phenylalanine and tyrosine) in colonic contents of female mice but not in male mice. Additionally, female mice had much greater correlations between microbe and metabolite than male mice. These findings suggest that sex-dependent effects should be considered for antibiotic-induced modifications of the gut microbiota and host metabolism. Accumulating evidence shows that the gut microbiota regulates host metabolism by producing a series of metabolites, such as amino , bile ,  , and others. These metabolites have a positive or negative effect on host health. Antibiotic exposure can disrupt the gut microbiota and thereby affect host metabolism and physiology. However, there are a limited number of studies addressing whether antibiotic effects on the gut microbiota and host metabolism are sex dependent. In this study, we uncovered a sex-dependent difference in antibiotic effects on the gut microbiota and metabolome in colonic contents and tissues in mice. These findings reveal that sex-dependent effects need to be considered for antibiotic use in scientific research or clinical practice. Moreover, this study will also give an important direction for future use of antibiotics to modify the gut microbiome and host metabolism in a sex-specific manner.Copyright © 2019 Gao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790444>Stimulation of Smithella-dominating propionate oxidation in a sediment enrichment by magnetite and carbon nanotubes.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown that application of conductive materials including magnetite and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can promote the methanogenic decomposition of short-chain   and even more complex organic matter in anaerobic digesters and natural habitats. The linkage to microbial identity and the mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the effects of nanoscale magnetite (nanoFe O ) and multiwalled CNTs on the syntrophic oxidation of propionate in an enrichment obtained from lake sediment. The microbial populations were composed mainly of Smithella, Syntrophomonas, Methanosaeta, Methanosarcina and Methanoregula. In addition to , butyrate was transiently accumulated indicating that propionate was oxidized by Smithella via the dismutation pathway and part of the leaked butyrate was oxidized by Syntrophomonas. Propionate oxidation and CH production were significantly accelerated in the presence of nanoFe O and CNTs. While propionate oxidation was suppressed upon H application and suspended completely upon formate application in the control, this suppressive effect was substantially compromised in the presence of nanoFe O and CNTs. The tests on hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis of a pure culture methanogen and of the enrichment culture without propionate showed negative effect by both materials. The positive effect of nanoFe O disappeared when it was insulated by surface-coating with silica. Observations made with fluorescence in situ hybridization and scanning electron microscope indicated the extensive formation of microbial cell-conductive material mixture aggregates. Our results suggest that direct interspecies electron transfer is likely activated by the conductive materials and operates in concert with H /formate-dependent electron transfer for syntrophic propionate oxidation in the sediment enrichment.© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802715>EtOAc extract of H. attenuatum Choisy inhibits inflammation by suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK pathways and modulating the gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Hypericum attenuatum Choisy, a traditional Chinese herb, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of diseases associated with inflammation and has been used to treat rheumatic arthritis in China for centuries. However, the underlying mechanism of its anti-inflammatory effect is poorly understood.In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of EtOAc fractions of H. attenuatum Choisy (Ha-EtOAc) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophage inflammation and hypothesized that Ha-EtOAc could attenuate inflammation in the colon.LPS was utilized to induce RAW264.7 cells inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effect of Ha-EtOAc in RAW264.7 cells was evaluated by measuring the inhibition ratio of nitric oxide (NO) production. Murine ulcerative colitis (UC) was induced by treatment with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The basic indexes of the mice, including body weight, food intake and hematochezia, were recorded during mice experiments.The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Additionally, the influences of Ha-EtOAc on the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. In addition, the impact of Ha-EtOAc on gut microbiota of mice with UC was detected by 16S rDNA sequencing.Ha-EtOAc inhibited the LPS-induced production of NO and decreased the release of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment with Ha-EtOAc could suppress the nuclear translocation of p65 and the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38 and JNK. Ha-EtOAc treatment ameliorated murine UC, as reflected by a reduced body weight loss, improved colon shortening, alleviated mucosal damage and decreased releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, Ha-EtOAc could modulate the composition of microbial communities.Our results demonstrated that Ha-EtOAc exhibited anti-inflammatory effects mainly by suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, and Ha-EtOAc treatment may be a potent therapy for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

The results showed that OL, S/I ratio and initial pH significantly affected batch anaerobic process. Methane yield was proved to be inversely proportional to OL and S/I ratio. Digester with lowest OL (5 g VS/L) obtained greatest methane yield (551.4 mL/g VS), highest organics removal (94.1%) and good stability. Enhancing OL to 10 g VS/L was recommended for satisfactory stability and higher volumetric methane productivity. When OL was designated as 10 g VS/L, digester with low S/I ratio (1/2) achieved satisfactory methane yield (539.3 mL/g VS), high organics removal (92.3%) and stable performance. When OL was relatively high (20 g VS/L), adjusting initial pH to 7.5 contributed to stable performance via enhancing buffering capacity against  (VFA) disturbance. Strong VFA inhibition occurred under high OL (40 g VS/L) or great S/I ratio (2/1) or acidic initial pH (6.5). In this case,  was dominant VFA, followed by butyrate.

While mechanisms of benefit are poorly understood, most models rely on the viability of transplanted microbes. We hypothesised that protocols commonly used in the preparation of faecal transplants will substantially reduce the number, diversity and functional potential of viable microbes.Stools from eight screened donors were processed under strict anaerobic conditions, in ambient air, and freeze-thawed. Propidium monoazide (PMA) sample treatment was combined with quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and short-chain  acid () analysis to define the viable microbiota composition and functional potential.Approximately 50% of bacterial content of stool processed immediately under strict anaerobic conditions was non-viable. Homogenisation in ambient air or freeze-thaw reduced viability to 19% and 23% respectively. Processing of samples in ambient air resulted in up to 12-fold reductions in the abundance of important commensal taxa, including the highly butyrogenic species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Subdoligranulum variable, and Eubacterium hallii. The adverse impact of atmospheric oxygen exposure on the capacity of the transplanted microbiota to support  biosynthesis was demonstrated by significantly reduced butyrate and  production by faecal slurries processed in ambient air. In contrast, while reducing overall levels of viable bacteria, freeze-thaw did not significantly alter viable microbiota composition.The practice of preparing material for faecal transplantation in ambient air profoundly affects viable microbial content, disproportionately reducing the abundance of anaerobic commensals and the capacity for biosynthesis of important anti-inflammatory metabolites.

In this method, in the synthesizing step, reduced graphene oxide was applied as a support, silver  as a precursor of Ag, and sodium hydroxide as a medium for reducing procedure. Then synthesized particles were characterized by using transmission electron microscopy analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray, and X-ray diffraction. Adsorbent potentials of the prepared nanocomposite were evaluated for sulfamethoxazole removal from polluted aqueous solutions via two different experimental methods, namely, "one-at-a-time" and "central composite design". The given results from the one-at-a-time method confirms that 0.007 g of silver@reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite can remove 88% (188.57 mg/g) of sulfamethoxazole from a 0.05 dm solution (initial concentration 30 mg/dm) at pH = 5 after 3600 s' contact time. However, in the central composite design method, the optimum condition was 95% (79.17 mg/g) uptake of this drug from 0.05 dm of polluted solution with initial concentration of 30 mg/dm and pH = 7.5, using 0.018 g of the adsorbent in 3600 s. The main mechanism for sulfamethoxazole removal can be suggested as a suitable interaction between S atoms in functional groups in the drug and Ag atoms on the surface of nanoparticles. The pseudo-second-order patterns and Freundlich model described the empirical data isotherm and kinetics for the adsorption processes, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity by experimental and theoretical isotherm methods (Langmuir) obtained 250 and 357 mg/g, respectively. Efficiency of the adsorbent in treatment of SMX from real samples displayed less hardness and electrical conductance samples have the maximum uptake percent while existence of nitrate ions in the solutions did not induce any negative effect on the removal of the SMX. All obtained results indicated loading of Ag nanoparticles on rGO nanosheets is an effective strategy for SMX uptake with high proficiency and shows great promise as pollutant adsorbent for environmental applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31157515>Ethyl  extract of Nepenthes adrianii x clipeata induces antiproliferation, apoptosis, and DNA damage against oral cancer cells through oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Nepenthes plants are regarded as a kind of Traditional Chinese Medicine for several diseases but its anticancer activity remain unclear. The subject of this study is to evaluate the antiproliferation effects on oral cancer cells by Nepenthes plants using ethyl  extract of Nepenthes adrianii x clipeata (EANA). Cell viability was detected using MTS assay. Its detailed mechanisms including cell cycle, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage were explored by flow cytometry or western blotting. For 24 hours EANA treatment, five kinds of oral cancer cells (CAL 27, Ca9-22, OECM-1, HSC-3, and SCC9) show IC values of cell viability ranging from 8 to 17 μg/mL but the viability of normal oral cells (HGF-1) remains over 80%. Subsequently, CAL 27 and Ca9-22 cells with high sensitivity to EANA were chosen to investigate the detailed mechanism. EANA displays the time course and concentration effects for inducing apoptosis based on flow cytometry (subG1 and annexin V analyses) and western blotting [cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (c-PARP)]. Oxidative stress and DNA damage were induced by EANA treatments in oral cancer cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, mitochondrial superoxide, and γH2AX. All these changes of EANA treatments in oral cancer cells were reverted by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine pretreatment. Therefore, EANA induces preferential killing, apoptosis, and DNA damage against oral cancer cells through oxidative stress.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295767>Targeting on Gut Microbial Metabolite Trimethylamine-N-Oxide and Short-Chain  Acid to Prevent Maternal High-Fructose-Diet-Induced Developmental Programming of Hypertension in Adult Male Offspring.</a></h2><p>Alterations of gut metabolites, such as SCFAs and trimethylamine (TMA), and microbial composition are associated with the development of hypertension. Whether maternal 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB, an inhibitor for TMA formation) treatment or the predominant   supplementation can prevent programed hypertension induced by a high-fructose diet (HFD) exposure during pregnancy and lactation in adult male offspring is examined.Male offspring are divided into four groups: ND, normal diet; HFD, 60% HFD; ACE, HFD plus 200 mmol L magnesium  in drinking water; and DMB: HFD plus 1% DMB in drinking water. Maternal HFD induces programed hypertension in adult male offspring, which is prevented by maternal  supplementation or DMB treatment. HFD-induced hypertension is relevant to increased plasma levels of TMA and , and alterations of gut microbial composition. The protective effects of  supplementation are associated with decreased plasma TMA level and TMA-to-trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) ratio, and increased renal expression of  receptors.

Forty Holstein male calves (161 ± 5.7 days of age and 192 ± 5.4 kg of body weight) were assigned to one of four groups in a randomized experimental design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Moderate crude protein (130.1 g CP/kg [MCP] or high crude protein (150.2 g CP/kg [HCP]) diets were fed without (RPFA-) or with 3.6 mg FA (RPFA+) as RPFA per kg dietary dry matter (DM). Calves were fed a total mixed ration with a corn silage to concentrate ratio of 50:50 on a DM basis. The CP×RPFA interaction was not significant for any of the studied variables. The unchanged DM intake, higher average daily gain and lower feed conversion ratio were observed for HCP or RPFA+. Ruminal pH was lower, and total  (VFA) concentration was higher for HCP or RPFA+.  proportion was higher, and propionate proportion was lower for HCP or RPFA+. As a result, the higher  to propionate ratio was observed. Ruminal ammonia N was higher for HCP, but was lower with RPFA supplementation. The higher digestibility of DM, OM, CP and NDF was observed. Blood glucose and insulin were unchanged, but albumin, total protein, GH and IGF-1 were higher. Similarly, the higher hepatic expression of GH, IGF-1, GHR, IGF-1R, PI3K, mTOR and P70S6K was observed for HCP or RPFA+. The results indicated that increasing dietary CP content or supplementation with RPFA promoted growth performance of calves by improving nutrient utilization and up-regulating hepatic expression of gene related to protein synthesis.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30976463>Photo-hydrogen and lipid production from lactate, , butyrate, and sugar manufacturing wastewater with an alternative nitrogen source by  sp KKU-PS1.</a></h2><p>Photo-hydrogen and lipid production from individual synthetic  (VFAs) and sugar manufacturing wastewater (SMW) by  sp.

Using individual synthetic VFAs, the maximum hydrogen production was achieved with Aji-L as a nitrogen source rather than sodium glutamate. The maximum hydrogen production was 1,727, 754 and 1,353 mL H/L, respectively, using 25 mM of lactate, 40 mM of  and 15mM of butyrate as substrates. Under these conditions, lipid was produced in the range of 10.6-16.9% (w/w). Subsequently, photo-hydrogen and lipid production from SMW using Aji-L as nitrogen source was conducted. Maximal hydrogen production and hydrogen yields of 1,672 mL H/L and 1.92 mol H/mol substrate, respectively, were obtained.

Here, we present a method for the quantification of SCFAs in fecal samples by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) upon derivatization to 3-nitrophenylhydrazones (3NPH). The method includes , propionate, butyrate, and isobutyrate with a run time of 4 min. The reproducible (coefficients of variation (CV) below 10%) quantification of SCFAs in human fecal samples was achieved by the application of stable isotope labelled internal standards. The specificity was demonstrated by the introduction of a quantifier and qualifier ions. The method was applied to investigate the pre-analytic stability of SCFAs in human feces. Concentrations of  may change substantially within hours; the degree and kinetics of these changes revealed huge differences between the donors. The fecal  level could be preserved by the addition of organic solvents like isopropanol. An analysis of the colon content of mice either treated with antibiotics or fed with a diet containing a non-degradable and -fermentable fiber source showed decreased  concentrations.

Therefore, radioprotective measures, against both acute and chronic biological effects of radiation, require frequent intake of nontoxic natural products, which have practical oral administration. The goal of this study was to characterize the radioprotective, radiomitigative and radiation-induced bystander effect-inhibiting properties of endogenous metabolites: phenylacetate, ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate. Compounds were administered pre- and postirradiation as well as in donor and recipient bystander flasks to analyze whether these might adequately protect against radiation injury as well as facilitate recovery from the exposures. The clonogenic HCT116 p53 wild-type cancer cell line in this study shares characteristics of stem cells, such as high reproductive viability, which is an effective marker to demonstrate compound effectiveness. Clonogenic assays were therefore used to characterize radioprotective, radiomitigative and bystander inhibiting properties of treatment compounds whereby cellular responses to radiation were quantified with macroscopic colony counts to measure cell survival in flasks. The results were statistically significant for phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate when administered preirradiation, conferring radioprotection up to 2 Gy, whereas administration postirradiation and in bystander experiments did not confer radioprotection . These findings suggest that phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate might be effective radioprotectors, although they possess no radiomitigative properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30989448>Herbal feed additives containing essential oil: 1. Impact on the nutritional worth of complete feed in vitro.</a></h2><p>This study was taken up to assess the impact of supplementing herbal feed additives [HFAs; fruit of Myristica fragrans (Jayphall), seeds of Anethum sowa (Suva), fruit of Apium graveolens (Ajmo), fruit of Cuminum cyminum (Jeera), bark of Cinnamonum zeylanicum (Dalchini), or whole plant of Eclipta alba (Bhangro)] containing essential oils as active component on the nutrient utilization and methane production using wheat straw-based total mixed ration (TMR) as a substrate by in vitro gas production technique. The essential oil content was the highest (P < 0.01) in M. fragrans followed by E. alba and A. sowa. In addition to essential oils, these HFAs also contained saponins, tannins, and antioxidants. The HFAs were supplemented at 1-3% of substrate dry matter (DM). The data were analyzed by 6 × 4 factorial design. Irrespective of level of HFA, the net gas production (NGP) and metabolizable energy (ME) availability was the highest (P < 0.01) in TMR supplemented with C. zeylanicum comparable with E. alba, but higher than TMR supplemented with other HFAs. Supplementation of TMR with different HFAs did not affect the digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and true organic matter (TOM) and partitioning factor (PF). The total  (VFAs), , propionate (P < 0.01), and butyrate (P < 0.05) production was the highest in TMR supplemented with A. sowa, and the lowest was observed in TMR supplemented with C. cyminum. The isobutyrate and valerate production was also the highest (P < 0.01) in diet supplemented with A. sowa, but isovalerate production was the highest (P < 0.01) in diet supplemented with C. zeylanicum. The A:P ratio was the best in TMR supplemented with A. sowa. The efficiency of rumen fermentation was the highest, and efficiency of conversion of hexose to methane was the lowest in diet supplemented with A. sowa as compared to all other supplements. The in vitro methane production expressed as either percent of NGP, ml/100 mg DM of substrate/24 h, or as ml/100 mg of digestible OM/24 h was the lowest in TMR supplemented with A. sowa. The ammonia nitrogen production from TMR supplemented with M. fragrans and A. sowa was comparable, but significantly (P < 0.01) lower than TMR supplemented with other HFAs. Irrespective of the nature of HFA, the NGP and ME availability were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in TMR supplemented with HFAs at all levels as compared to un-supplemented TMR. As compared to control, the digestibility of NDF and that of TOM was depressed slightly in all the HFA-supplemented TMRs. The supplementation of HFAs at 2% of substrate DM improved (P < 0.01) the production of total VFAs, , and propionate, and that of isovalerate in comparison to the un-supplemented TMR. The  to propionate ratio increased (P < 0.01) with the increase in the level of supplementation of HFAs containing essential oils. The methane and ammonia productions were depressed significantly when TMR was supplemented at 2% level of HFAs as compared to control TMR. It was concluded that supplementation of TMR with A. sowa at 2% of substrate was fermented better as indicated by the production of total and individual VFA, methane, and ammonia as compared to TMR supplemented with other HFA or un-supplemented TMR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31017520>Spatial distribution of major bacterial species and different  in a two-phase anaerobic biofilm reactor with PVA gel beads as bio-carrier.</a></h2><p>Conventional completely mixed anaerobic treatment systems limit the chances of the different species of bacteria to spatially group together according to their mutual cooperation and as a result, show a lower efficiency and vulnerability towards shock situations.

Dietary intake of high amylose maize starch (HAMS) can promote commensal fermentative bacteria and drive the production of short chain   (SCFAs). By stabilizing commensal gut microbiology, and stimulating the production of anti-inflammatory metabolites, HAMS supplementation might therefore influence enteric health. However, the extent to which the gut microbiota of LMIC infants are capable of fermenting HAMS is unclear. We assessed the capacity of the fecal microbiota from pre-weaning and weaning Malawian infants to ferment HAMS and produce SCFAs using an  fermentation model. Fecal microbiota from both pre-weaning and weaning infants were able to ferment HAMS, as indicated by an increase in bacterial load and total  concentration, and a reduction in pH. All of these changes were more substantial in the weaning group.  production was observed with both pre-weaning and weaning groups, while propionate production was only observed in the weaning group. HAMS fermentation resulted in significant alterations to the fecal microbial community in the weaning group, with significant increases in levels of , and  associated with propionate production.

This study elucidated the effect of transglycosylated starch (TGS) on the retention of digesta in the upper digestive tract, ileal flow and hindgut disappearance of nutrients, and subsequent bacterial profiles in pigs. Fourteen ileal-cannulated growing pigs were fed either the TGS or control (CON) diet in a complete crossover design. Each period consisted of a 10-d adaptation to the diets, followed by 3-d collection of faeces and ileal digesta. Consumption of TGS decreased the retention of digesta in the stomach and small intestine, and increased ileal DM, starch, Ca and P flow, leading to enhanced starch fermentation in the hindgut compared with CON-fed pigs. TGS increased ileal and faecal total , especially ileal and faecal  and faecal butyrate. Gastric retention time positively correlated to Klebsiella, which benefitted together with Selenomonas, Lactobacillus, Mitsuokella and Coriobacteriaceae from TGS feeding and ileal starch flow. Similar relationships existed in faeces with Coriobacteriaceae, Veillonellaceae and Megasphaera benefitting most, either directly or indirectly via cross-feeding, from TGS residuals in faeces.

To solve this issue, anaerobic co-fermentation of cellulose-rich Oyster champost and sewage sludge was tested to enhance the VFA production, and the effect of proportion of mixed substrate was investigated in this study.

In the co-fermentation system, the optimal C/N ratio and features of mixed substrate contributed to the enhancement in hydrolysis and acidification in terms of organic solubilization and VFA production, respectively. But the co-fermentation could not increase VFA/SCOD ratio, probably due to the existence of refractory products such as humic-like and protein-like materials.

Key functional groups at the genus level identified by high-throughput sequencing were evaluated as well. The results showed that anaerobic feeding mode and  promoted the compact AGS formation with excellent total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency (averaging 91.7% ± 4.1%) at various dissolved oxygen conditions. While the aerobic feeding mode led to a loose AGS structure with a vulnerable anaerobic core and poor TN removal efficiency (averaging 58.8% ± 7.4%). Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process played the dominant role in N removal in compact AGS over the alternating nitrification and denitrification process. High-concentration glucose undermined feast-famine condition with filamentous bacteria growth out of granule and decreased TN removal efficiency to 67.3% ± 15.2%. Lower food to microorganism ratio may result in a lower N removal rate attributed to the sharply increased biomass concentration fed by glucose. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, denitrifying bacteria, and denitrifying phosphorus accumulation organisms enriched during AGS granulation also contributed to the efficient N removal. The proposed strategy provided insights into the relationship between various factors and stable AGS formation, and systemic operation methods for various complicated wastewater treatment.Copyright © 2019.

The response of two experimental, continuously stirred tank reactors under mesophilic condition (fed with pig manure) was investigated to analyze the perturbation of organic and hydraulic overloading, and low-temperature shock. The pH was stably maintained in the range of 7.2-7.7, regardless of the presence of most simulated perturbation situations. Monitoring of biogas production and composition is important to reflect the current state of biogas process, but cannot predict the imbalance in the system. Accumulation of total VFAs up to 21,718 mg/L was observed under the organic overloading condition (rapid increase of the organic loading rate of pig manure from 3 g VS/L/d to 9 g VS/L/d), but not for other perturbations. The ratio of propionate to  and that of intermediate alkalinity to partial alkalinity are rapidly altered in response to all perturbations, indicating their potential to function as stability indicators. However, the determination of the ratio of intermediate alkalinity to partial alkalinity can be performed by simple titration methods and be easily applied to actual projects without significant investment in advanced equipment and skilled operators.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Eighteen three-month-old Santa Ines castrated male lambs (16.9 ± 1.43 kg of body weight) were randomly distributed in two experimental treatments: Infected with T. colubriformis (I, n = 9) and Uninfected (U, n = 9). The I lambs received a total of 45,000 L larvae of T. colubriformis (5,000 infective larvae, three times per week for three weeks). Daily feed intake was assessed using the I lambs as a reference for their respective pairs on the U group (pair-fed). Weight, body condition score and faeces (stool) samples were obtained every 15 days for 75 days. In both treatments, faecal egg count (FEC), digesta passage rate, rumen fermentation parameters, protozoa count and short chain   () were evaluated. The lambs presented moderate infection (FEC = 620). The retention time of the digesta in the rumen-reticulum segment was lower (P < 0.05) in I lambs. The I lambs presented no inappetence, however, lower concentrations of total  and butyrate, while higher  concentration were observed in these lambs (P < 0.05). The present findings highlight that T. colubriformis infection decreased the retention time (solid and liquid content) of the digesta in the rumen-reticulum, as well as negatively affected lamb growth.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the long-term impact of O on the microbial communities. In the present study, two biofilters treating gaseous ethyl  were operated continuously for 230 days with inlet loads up to 180 g m∙h. A biofilter operated under continuous O addition (90 ppb) yielded consistently higher removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC) compared to the control system. After 120 days of operation, a lower biomass content accompanied by a pH of 1.5 was observed in the ozonated biofilter, which was 2 units lower compared to the control reactor. Both reactors developed a distinct microbial community composition over the course of 230 days. The bacterial community was dominated in both biofilters by Beijerinckia and Gluconacetobacter, while Rhinocladiella similis, Trichosporon veenhuissi and Exophilia oligosperma were abundant in the fungal community. These findings suggest that ozonation of the biofiltration systems not only reduced clogging, but also contributed to the selection of biomass suitable for degradation of ethyl .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of a large amount of NaOH in order to raise and buffer the low pH, is reported to be inhibitory to methanogens. In order to address this problem, we acclimatized aceticlastic methanogens to low pH. Methanogens were successfully acclimatized to initial low pH down to 3.5 in a lengthy, five months, acclimatization period. The aceticlastic methanogen, Methanothrix soehngenii which was 96.3% of the total methanogenic population at pH 4.5 and 86.75% at pH 3.5, demonstrated that they were the most tolerant aceticlastic methanogens to low pH. After acclimatization, methane yield at pH 4.5 was comparable to neutral pH. Methanosaeta maintained its dominance over Methanosarcina at an elevated level of  (66 mM), and a negative correlation was observed between them.

In a 7-day aerobic batch culture at 30 °C, the biomass and lipid concentrations were maximized using an initial molasses concentration of 80 g/L and ammonium  (nitrogen source) concentration of 2.14 g/L. At a fixed initial molasses concentration of 80 g/L, the concentration of the nitrogen source was further fine-tuned to 2.25 g/L, to maximize the lipid content of the biomass to around 30% by dry mass. This medium was used to test the effects of stressing salts (sodium , magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride) on production of lipids and biomass. A two-step bolus feeding with magnesium sulfate and sodium , enhanced the final biomass concentration to around 19 g/L (a 50% increase relative to control), but the lipid content in the biomass was reduced to around 16% w/w. A 33% enhancement in lipid concentration relative to control, was achieved by feeding magnesium sulfate and sodium .

Coupling of magnetite (FeO) and zero valent iron (ZVI) was firstly used to enhance anaerobic digestion of phenol. The results indicated an obvious synergistic effect was generated with coupling of FeO and ZVI during the whole anaerobic digestion of phenol. The phenol degradation rate and methane production of FeO/ZVI-added group were increased by 8.8-23.1% and 11.9-31.6%, respectively compared with FeO-added group, and enhanced by 5.9-17.1% and 4.4-18.3%, respectively compared with ZVI-added group. ZVI improved the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and FeO enhanced the growth of syntrophic -oxidizing bacteria.

We previously observed that gut microbiome alteration via antibiotics led to attenuated lung inflammatory responses. The rationale for this study was to identify gut microbiome factors that regulate lung immune homeostasis. We first investigated key factors within mouse colonic lumen filtrates (CLF) which could elicit direct inflammatory effects . We identified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and SCFAs as key CLF ingredients whose levels and inflammatory capacity changed after antibiotic exposure in mice. Specifically, the  propionate appeared to be a key regulator of LPS responses . Elevated propionate:  ratios, as seen in CLF after antibiotic exposure, strongly blunted inflammatory responses . , exposure of lungs to high dose propionate, to mimic how prior antibiotic exposure changed  levels, resulted in diminished immune containment of  pneumonia.

Microbes inhabiting in the fermentation pit mud largely determines baijiu's flavour and quality. In order to shed light on the microbial functional groups driving butyrate production in pit mud, clone library analysis was firstly performed and the results demonstrated that Clostridia (relative abundance: 50%) and Bacilli (37%) were major groups possessing butyrate kinase (buk) pathway and Clostridia (98%) dominated butyryl-CoA: CoA-transferase (but) pathway. According to Clostridial specific-16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we found the resilience character of Clostridial community in pit mud. Amongst Clostridial groups, 32.0% of the sequences were grouped into Clostridiales incertae sedis, followed by Heliobacteriaceae (18.3%) and Clostridiaceae 1 (8.4%). Moreover, Hydrogenispora, Sedimentibacter and Clostridium were the top three abundant genera. Relative abundance of Hydrogenispora was higher in the late days of fermentation, while Sedimentibacter exhibited higher proportion in the early days. Different from the previous studies using universal bacterial primer sets, Hydrogenispora was first reported as one dominant genus in pit mud. As for the reported potential butyrate producer Clostridium, nineteen species were obtained and ten of them were first isolated from the pit mud. Amongst them, buk was identified in eleven species by PCR analysis, while but was identified in the other seven, indicating the species-specific butyrate synthesis pathways of Clostridium.

Forty Arabi male lambs with average body weight of 18.90 ± 0.6 kg were randomly divided into five treatments with eight replications. The five experimental treatments consisted of control diet, and 50% and 100% replacement of bean residues with wheat straw or 25% and 50% replacement with maize silage in the control diet respectively. Lambs were slaughtered at the end of the experiment to evaluate carcass traits and meat characteristics. Dry matter intake, blood glucose, urea nitrogen, cholesterol and triglyceride concentration were not affected by the experimental treatments. Apparent digestibility of nutrients; total concentration of ,  and butyrate; and total rumen protozoa population were linearly increased by increasing the levels of bean residues, as replacement with wheat straw (p < .05). Replacement of bean residues in control diets instead of wheat straw or maize silage caused a positive linear incremental trend for average daily gain and total weight gain. There was no significant difference in daily gain, final weight and feed conversion ratio among the treatments. Instead of wheat straw or maize silage, replacement bean residues linearly increased chewing, ruminating and eating activities per neutral detergent fibre intake (p < .05). Carcass traits and physicochemical characteristics of meat were not affected by the treatments. It is advisable to use bean residues in the diet of lambs as an alternative to the wheat straw or maize silage, because no adverse effects were observed on rumen fermentation, blood metabolites and performance; moreover, improvement in average daily gain, total weight gain and digestibility of nutrients, and the fact that bean residue is less expensive than wheat straw and maize silage.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276993>Enhanced production of short-chain   from waste activated sludge by addition of magnetite under suitable alkaline condition.</a></h2><p>Alkaline fermentation technology is an effective method for resource recovery, e.g., short-chain   (SCFAs), but the acidification process needs to be further enhanced.

Among the three VFAs, methanogenic degradation of propionate was the least feasible (57% lower specific methanogenic activity R and three times longer lag time λ than  degradation). At low ammonia concentration, only propionate showed improvement in R (46%) with supplementation of magnetite. In the ammonia-stressed condition without magnetite, R decreased by 38-58% and λ increased 2.2-8.8 times for all VFAs; magnetite supplementation significantly alleviated these effects. These results demonstrate that magnetite supplementation effectively increases methanogenic degradation of the VFAs even under ammonia-stressed conditions. 16S metagenomic sequencing revealed that distinctive methanogenic consortia were active in the different combinations of substrate, ammonia and magnetite. Alkaliphilus, Hyphomonadaceae SWB02 and Clostridia DTU014, Clostridia D8A-2, Christensenellaceae R-7 group and Rikenellaceae DMER64 were identified as potential syntrophic bacteria that can establish magnetite-mediated direct electron transfer with methanogens (Methanosaeta concilii, Methanosaeta harundinacea, Methanolinea tarda, Methanoculleus bourgensis and Methanosarcina spp.) during methanogenic degradation of VFAs.

The co-solvent is most often an alcohol and may contain a third component in small proportions, called an additive (acid, base or salt). In the first part of this series, the effects of mobile phase additives on the polarity and apparent pH of the mobile phase were explored. In the present paper, we examine the effects pertaining to adsorption of additives on the stationary phase. Ammonium  was selected as a representative case, because it is often employed in current practice. To favour its solubility and further improve chromatographic quality, a small portion of water is also advocated. First, the equilibration time is observed to be largely increased in the presence of an additive, especially when mobile phase compositions containing only low proportions of methanol co-solvent are employed. Secondly, the effects of ammonium  are more thoroughly assessed with a modified version of the solvation parameter model (five Abraham descriptors and two descriptors to take account of positive and negative charges on ionizable species). On a hybrid silica stationary phase (ACQUITY UPC BEH), the effects of increasing concentration of ammonium  (0-25 mM in the methanol co-solvent) are investigated. The retention of acidic species is the most strongly affected, with a continuous retention increase when additive concentration increases. The retention of basic and neutral species is also moderately affected. Then thirty-two stationary phases based on sub-2 μm totally porous particles or sub-3 μm superficially porous particles are characterized with and without 20 mM ammonium  and 2% water in the methanol co-solvent. The effects of adsorbed additive on the interaction capabilities are discussed. Finally, the interest of introducing the additive in the dilution solvent, a method that was sometimes recommended to simplify the workflow, is also discussed with a model basic compound.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs , propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

Through site-specific mutagenesis and crystallisation studies, the catalytic mechanism was investigated and found to be dependent on a threonine-histidine dyad. The mutant with additional histidine residues generated the highest kcat values, forming a His-His-Thr triad and matched previously reported metalloenzymes. The highly symmetrical β-propeller artificial enzymes and their protein-metal complexes have potential to be utilised in bioinorganic and supramolecular chemistry, as well as being developed further into 2D/3D catalytic materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30852303>Anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity based on polymorphism of cedrol in mice.</a></h2><p>Alternate forms of drug crystals display different physicochemical properties. These include stability, dissolution rate, bioavailability and solubility, which can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. It is therefore important to compare the crystal forms of cedrol to obtain optimal anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. This study, for the first time, obtained and reports three novel forms (I-III) of cedrol polymorphs. The three forms of cedrol were recrystallized from seven organic solvents by slow cooling or volatilization and identified by thermal analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction analysis. Form I originated from acetone and cyclohexane. Form II was obtained from ethanol, ethyl , acetonitrile and n-hexane. Form III was recrystallized from methanol. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of the three crystalline forms were evaluated by acetic acid induced writhing in mice, the hot plate method, carrageenan induced mouse paw edema models, Xylene-induced mouse ear edema models and cotton pellet-induced mouse granuloma models. Experimental results revealed that the highest performance was achieved from Form I. These findings are of great significance during the early research study of cedrol polymorphs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the gastroprotective potential of the ethyl  extract from the leaves of A. schaueriana (As-AcOEt).Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detection and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS/MS) was performed to identify chemical constituents of the ethyl  extract from the leaves ofA. schaueriana. Total phenols, flavonoids and tannins were determined and antioxidant activity was evaluated using the DPPH and ABTS methods. The acute toxicity of As-AcOEt and gastroprotective activity on HCl/ethanol-induced gastric ulcers were assessed and mechanisms of action involving the role of nitric oxide, sulfhydryl compounds, and prostaglandins were investigated.Terpenes, flavonoids and tannins were detected in the extract. As-AcOEt exhibited antioxidant activity, with an EC of 42.2 ± 4.4 μg/mL (DPPH) and 73.2% inhibition of ABTS radicals. UPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS/MS analysis identified gallic acid, gallic acid derivative, ellagic acid, myricetin pentoside, myricetin deoxyhexose, quercetin pentoside, quercetin deoxyhexose, and other compounds. Gallic acid was isolated in this species for the first time. During the acute toxicity test, no deaths or changes occurred in the variables evaluated. In the ethanol-induced ulcer model, As-AcOEt reduced the ulcerative lesion index, with 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg achieving 83.8, 88.5 and 86.9% inhibition, respectively. MPO levels decreased and the gastric mucosa of the animals treated with the extract was preserved. Pre-treatment with N-omega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; NO blocker) or carbenoxolone (CBXN; NP-SH blocker) reversed the gastroprotective effect of As-AcOEt, but this effect was not reversed with the previous administration of indomethacin.The present findings reveal that the extract from the leaves ofA. schaueriana has gastroprotective effects, suggesting the involvement of nitric oxide and nonprotein sulfhydryl compounds, but not prostaglandin. Therefore, the use of A. schaueriana in Brazilian folk medicine for the treatment of gastric disorders has a scientific basis.Copyright © 2019.

The gut microbiota/gut hormone axis has recently received increasing attention. However, the relationship between the gut microbiota and melatonin receptors has not yet been evaluated. We aimed to determine the effect of the gut microbiota on colonic melatonin receptor expression in germ-free (GF) rats and to further explore the potential mechanism in Caco-2 cells. In this study, GF rats were transplanted with fecal samples from a healthy human donor. Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to analyze the microbial communities. Colon tissue was collected for immunohistochemical analysis. The correlations between melatonin receptor expression and the gut microbiota were assessed. Melatonin receptor expression in Caco-2 cells was detected by Western blot. We found that fecal microbiota transplantation significantly increased the expression of colonic melatonin receptors in GF rats. The amount of fecal Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was significantly higher in fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) rats than in GF rats. SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Alistipes and Blautia, were positively correlated with colonic melatonin receptor expression in FMT rats. Additionally,  and propionate significantly increased melatonin receptor-1 expression in Caco-2 cells. Therefore, the gut microbiota may promote melatonin receptor expression, and the mechanism may involve the action of SCFAs. This finding may facilitate the development of new therapeutic treatments for various gastrointestinal disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797336>Frucooligosaccharides purification: Complexing simple sugars with phenylboronic acid.</a></h2><p>Prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are currently obtained by enzymatic reaction with fructosyltransferases (FTFs) using sucrose as both donor and acceptor. In these reactions glucose results as the most abundant by-product, arising from each fructosyl transfer event and, together with fructose, because of the inherent hydrolytic activity of the FTFs. As FOS are mainly used as prebiotic in nutraceutical foods, the reduction or total elimination of monosaccharides is required. In this work the selective elimination of monosaccharides from a synthetic FOS mixture was achieved through the selective complexation of glucose and fructose with phenyl boronic acid (PBAc) followed by ethyl- extraction. The process was applied to a complex mixture of FOS obtained in an enzymatic synthesis reaction containing 40% glucose, 15.8% fructose and 35% of FOS, elimination of the sugars was achieved through 3:1 molar reactions, resulting in a levan-type FOS product with 97% purity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Four treatments for each diet were evaluated in an  batch culture system over 24 h: (1) control with no addition of substrates; (2) 4 g YSP/l; (3) 5 g IN/l; (4) 4 g YSP/l in combination with 5 g IN/l of faecal culture of dogs fed Diet L or H. Several changes in fermentation metabolites were analysed. Samples incubated with the faecal inocula of dogs fed Diet L produced higher concentrations of total , propionate ( = 0.001),  ( ≤ 0.001), d-lactate ( = 0.041) and indole ( = 0.003), whereas pH ( = 0.004) was decreased. Supplementation of IN increased the content of putrescine, d- and l-lactate, total , , propionate, -butyrate ( ≤ 0.001) and -valerate ( = 0.003), while -valerate, indole and pH ( ≤ 0.001) were reduced. Ammonia was lower ( = 0.013) in samples with faecal inocula from dogs fed Diet H and further reduced by the addition of IN ( ≤ 0.001). Samples with faecal inocula from dogs fed Diet L had a fewer quotient of ammonia and total  ( = 0.040). Supplementation of YSP ( = 0.021), IN ( ≤ 0.001) and YSP in combination with IN ( = 0.047) led to a higher reduction of the quotient of ammonia and total .

Wide range of phytochemicals, including, hydroxybenzoic , hydroxycinnamic , acylquinic , ellagitannins, flavonoids, and triterpenoid saponins were determined using UHPLC-ESI/HRMS technique. The ethyl  and methanol extracts of the studied Rubus species effectively inhibited acetyl and butyryl cholinesterase. On the other hand, R. sanctus water extract showed low inhibition against α-amylase and prominent inhibitory action against α-glucosidase. Data collected from this study reported the radical scavenging and reducing potential of the studied Rubus species. Investigation of the protective effects of the different extracts of R. sanctus and R. ibericus in experimental model of ulcerative colitis was performed. The extracts were also tested on spontaneous migration of human colon cancer cells (HCT116) in wound healing experimental paradigm. Only R. sanctus methanol extract inhibited spontaneous HCT116 migration in the wound healing test. Our results suggested that R. sanctus and R. ibericus may be potential candidates as sources of biologically-active compounds for the development of nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and/or cosmetics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, the syntheses of esters and higher alcohols are considerably influenced by intracellular CoA levels catalyzed by pantothenate kinase. In this work, we examined the effects of cofactor CoA and acetyl-CoA synthesis on the metabolism of esters and higher alcohols. Strains 12α-BAP2 and 12α+ATF1 where generated by deleting and overexpressing BAP2 (encoded branched-chain amino acid permease) and ATF1 (encoded alcohol acetyl transferases), respectively, in the parent 12α strains. Then, 12α-BAP2+CAB1 and 12α-BAP2+CAB3 strains were obtained by overexpressing CAB1 (encoded pantothenate kinase Cab1) and CAB3 (encoded pantothenate kinase Cab3) in the 12α-BAP2 strain, and 12α-BAP2+CAB1+ATF1 and 12α-BAP2+CAB3+ATF1 were generated by overexpressing ATF1 in the pantothenate kinase overexpression strains. The  ester level in 12α-BAP2 was slightly changed relative to that in the control strain 12α, whereas the  ester levels in 12α-BAP2+CAB1, 12α-BAP2+CAB3, 12α-BAP2+CAB1+ATF1, and 12α-BAP2+CAB3+ATF1 were distinctly increased (44-118% for ethyl  and 18-57% for isoamyl ). The levels of n-propanol, methyl-1-butanol, isopentanol, isobutanol, and phenethylol levels were changed and varied among the six engineered strains. The levels of  esters and higher alcohols can be modulated by changing the CoA and acetyl-CoA levels.

They are linked with multiple beneficial effects on the general mammalian health, based on the sophisticated interplay with the host immune response. Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV1) is a major pathogen, which primarily replicates in the respiratory epithelium, and disseminates through the body via a cell-associated viremia in leukocytes, even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Infected monocytic CD172a cells and T-lymphocytes transmit EHV1 to the endothelium of the endometrium or central nervous system (CNS), causing reproductive or neurological disorders. Here, we questioned whether  have a potential role in shaping the pathogenesis of EHV1 during the primary replication in the URT, during the cell-associated viremia, or at the level of the endothelium of the pregnant uterus and/or CNS. First, we demonstrated the expression of  receptors, FFA2 and FFA3, within the epithelium of the equine respiratory tract, at the cell surface of immune cells, and equine endothelium. Subsequently, EHV1 replication was evaluated in the URT, in the presence or absence of SB, SPr, or SAc. In general, we demonstrated that  do not affect the number of viral plaques or virus titer upon primary viral replication. Only SB and SPr were able to reduce the plaque latitudes. Similarly, pretreatment of monocytic CD172a cells and T-lymphocytes with different concentrations of  did not alter the number of infected cells. When endothelial cells were treated with SB, SPr, or SAc, prior to the co-cultivation with EHV1-inoculated mononuclear cells, we observed a reduced number of adherent immune cells to the target endothelium. This was associated with a downregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in the presence of , which ultimately lead to a significant reduction of the EHV1 endothelial plaques. These results indicate that physiological concentrations of  may affect the pathogenesis of EHV1, mainly at the target endothelium, in favor of the fitness of the horse. Our findings may have significant implications to develop innovative therapies, to prevent the devastating clinical outcome of EHV1 infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307374>Time-series transcriptome provides insights into the gene regulation network involved in the  terpenoid metabolism during the flower development of lavender.</a></h2><p>Essential oils (EOs) of Lavandula angustifolia, mainly consist of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, are of great commercial value. The multi-flower spiciform thyrse of lavender not only determines the output of EOs but also reflects an environmental adaption strategy. With the flower development and blossom in turn, the fluctuation of the  terpenoids displayed a regular change at each axis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of  terpenoids during the process of flowering is poorly understood in lavender. Here, we combine metabolite and RNA-Seq analyses of flowers of five developmental stages at first- and second-axis (FFDSFSA) and initial flower bud (FB0) to discover the active terpenoid biosynthesis as well as flowering-related genes.A total of 56 mono- and sesquiterpenoids were identified in the EOs of L. angustifolia 'JX-2'. FB0' EO consists of 55 compounds and the two highest compounds, β-trans-ocimene (20.57%) and (+)-R-limonene (17.00%), can get rid of 74.71 and 78.41% aphids in Y-tube olfactometer experiments, respectively. With sequential and successive blossoms, temporally regulated volatiles were linked to pollinator attraction in field and olfaction bioassays. In three characteristic compounds of FFDSFSA' EOs, linalyl  (72.73%) and lavandulyl  (72.09%) attracted more bees than linalool (45.35%). Many transcripts related to flowering time and  terpenoid metabolism expressed differently during the flower development. Similar metabolic and transcriptomic profiles were observed when florets from the two axes were maintained at the same maturity grade. Besides both compounds and differentially expressed genes were rich in FB0, most  compounds were significantly correlated with FB0-specific gene module. Most key regulators related to flowering and terpenoid metabolism were interconnected in the subnetwork of FB0-specific module, suggesting the cross-talk between the two biological processes to some degree.Characteristic compounds and gene expression profile of FB0 exhibit ecological value in pest control. The precise control of each-axis flowering and regular emissions at transcriptional and metabolic level are important to pollinators attraction for lavender. Our study sheds new light on lavender maximizes its fitness from "gene- terpenoid-insect" three layers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623169>Urolithin Metabotypes Can Determine the Modulation of Gut Microbiota in Healthy Individuals by Tracking Walnuts Consumption over Three Days.</a></h2><p>Walnuts are rich in polyphenols ellagitannins, modulate gut microbiota (GM), and exert health benefits after long-term consumption. The metabolism of ellagitannins to urolithins via GM depends on urolithin metabotypes (UM-A, -B, or -0), which have been reported to predict host responsiveness to a polyphenol-rich intervention. This study aims to assess whether UMs were associated with differential GM modulation after short-term walnut consumption. In this study, 27 healthy individuals consumed 33 g of peeled raw walnuts over three days. GM profiling was determined using 16S rRNA illumina sequencing and specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs), as well as microbial activity using short-chain   analysis in stool samples. UMs stratification of volunteers was assessed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-electro spray ionization-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) analysis of urolithins in urine samples. The gut microbiota associated with UM-B was more sensitive to the walnut intervention. , and members of the Coriobacteriaceae family, including , increased exclusively in UM-B subjects, while some members of the Lachnospiraceae family decreased in UM-A individuals.  and  increased in both UMs and higher  and propionate production resulted after walnuts intake.

The CSC apparatus was reinforced the planet axis to maintain the stable satellite motion, which was completed by combining the rotation of three axes including the sun axis (the angular velocity, ω), the planet axis (ω) and the satellite axis (ω) under the relation at ω = ω + ω. In the present study, four different rotation speed combination types were used for the separation at the ratio (ω, ω, ω) = I. (300, 150, 150), II. (300, 100, 200), III. (300, 147, 153) and IV. (300, 200, 100 rpm) under different revolution speeds of ω = 300, 400 and 500 rpm. In the conventional multilayer coiled column with the upper mobile phase, the rotation speed combination type II yielded the best peak resolution while the rotation speed combination types III and IV had extremely low stationary phase retention even at higher revolution speeds. This inconvenience was eliminated by using the eccentric and the toroidal coiled column. The rotation speed combination type II for the eccentric coiled column and the type IV for the toroidal coiled column produced the best separation in both the upper and the lower mobile phases among four different rotation speed combination types. The overall results indicated that better peak resolution was obtained by the eccentric coiled column than by the toroidal coiled column except for the separation with the upper mobile phase at the low revolution speed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We used a total of thirty-two Nellore steers (initial BW of 197 ± 15.3 kg), 12 of which were fitted with rumen cannulas. For 13 months, the animals were maintained in 12 paddocks and fed a concentrate of ground corn, soybean meals, mineral supplements, and urea (URS) or encapsulated nitrate (EN) containing 70 g of EN/100 kg of BW (corresponding to 47 g NO /100 kg BW). Encapsulated nitrate supplementation resulted in similar forage, supplement and total DMI values as URS ( > 0.05), but ENS tended to increase (+48 g/d;  = 0.055) average daily weight gain. Daily reductions in methane emissions (-9.54 g or 18.5%) were observed with ENS when expressed as g of CH/kg of forage dry matter intake (fDMI) ( = 0.037). Lower concentrations of NH-N and a higher ruminal pH were observed in ENS groups 6 h after supplementation ( < 0.05). Total VFA rumen concentration 6 h ( = 0.009) and 12 h after supplementation with EN resulted in lower  concentrations in the rumen ( = 0.041). Steers supplemented with EN had a greater ruminal abundance of , , and  sp. ( < 0.05), but a lower abundance of  sp. ( = 0.007). Strong negative correlations were found between daily methane emissions and Proteobacteria, Erysipelotrichaceae, Prevotellaceae, and , , , , and  sp. ( < 0.05) in the rumen of ENS steers. Encapsulated nitrate is a feed additive that persistently affects enteric methane emission in grazing steers, thereby decreasing  abundance in the rumen.

We recently showed that replacing corn with molassed sugar beet pulp (Bp) improved fiber degradation in high-producing dairy cattle, possibly because of an improvement of rumen and hindgut conditions for microbes by Bp feeding. However, little is known about the effects of high inclusion rates of Bp on hindgut microbes and fermentation. Thus fecal grab samples were taken from 18 high-yielding Simmental cows after 28 d of feeding 3 different levels of Bp (n = 6) for bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. In addition, the reticular pH was continuously monitored with indwelling sensors and eating and ruminating behavior was evaluated with noseband sensors. The Bp inclusion rates were 0 g/kg (i.e., no Bp inclusion as control, CON), 120 g/kg (12Bp), or 240 g/kg (24Bp) replacing corn grain and limestone on a dry matter basis. The amount of time spent eating and ruminating was unaffected by Bp level, and the daily fluctuation in the reticular pH was reduced by 25% with Bp inclusion from 0.8 in the CON diet to 0.6 in 24Bp fed animals. Also, the fecal pH tended to increase with dietary Bp inclusion. Fecal  production showed a quadratic tendency with the lowest concentration (58.9%) of the total short-chain  acid in the 12Bp treatment. Inclusion of Bp up to 24% of the diet decreased the fecal butyrate proportion by 27%. The Shannon diversity index was increased from 5.50 to 8.09 with dietary Bp inclusion indicating increased species diversity. Of the 200 most abundant operational taxonomic units, 25 were increased by dietary Bp inclusion, whereas 15 were decreased and 7 were quadratically affected. The second most abundant group was proposed taxon "CF231" of the family Paraprevotellaceae. Although it accounted for only 2.52% of the operational taxonomic units in the CON diet, it was increased by 64% with dietary Bp inclusion. The largest relative change in the abundance was found for the genus Fibrobacter that increased more than 14-fold from 0.04% (CON) to 0.66% (24Bp). In conclusion, feeding molassed sugar beet pulp as partial substitution of corn up to 240 g/kg is a viable alternative that promotes ruminal and hindgut fermentation by supporting physiological pH and bacterial diversity.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of supplementing SFA in the form of triglycerides (TSFA), as compared to CSFA, on yields, efficiency and diet digestibility in high-yielding dairy cows. Twenty-eight (14 cows in each group) multiparous cows were fed a basal diet supplemented (on DM basis) with either 12 g/kg TSFA (~350 g/cow per day - contained 980 g/kg fat; 882.3 g/kg SFAs) or 14 g/kg CSFA (~440 g/cow per day - contained 800 g/kg fat; 566.4 g/kg SFAs). The supplement amounts in the diet were balanced according to fat content. Rumen samples were taken for measurements of ammonia and  concentrations, and fecal samples were taken for digestibility measurements. The CSFA cows produced 3% higher milk yields (47.6 v. 46.2 kg/day; P < 0.0001) and 4.7% higher 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM; 44.7 v. 42.7 kg/day; P = 0.02) than the TSFA cows. No difference in milk-fat content was observed, but milk-protein content was higher in the TSFA than CSFA cows. Yields of fat and protein were similar, but lactose yields were higher in TSFA cows. There were no differences in dry matter intake or efficiency calculations between groups. The ruminal ammonia concentrations were similar between groups, whereas  concentrations and  : propionate ratio were greater for CSFA than TSFA cows. The apparent total-tract digestibility of dry (P < 0.0007) and organic matters (P < 0.0003), fat (P < 0.0001), NDF and ADF (P = 0.02) were lower in the TSFA v. CSFA cows. In conclusion, the CSFA-supplemented cows produced 3% higher milk and 4.7% higher 4% FCM than the TSFA cows. However, TSFA supplementation did not depress milk-protein content. The apparent total-tract digestibility was lower for all dietary components in the TSFA cows, which was probably due to the effects of both degree of saturation and triglyceride form of the TSFA supplement. Considering that diets were balanced according to the fat content of the supplements, the lower yields of milk and FCM observed in the TSFA than CSFA cows were likely due to the lower digestibility of the fat and other nutrients in the TSFA cows, which might have negatively influenced the dietary energy content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075175>Effects of Weight-Loss Interventions on Short-Chain  Acid Concentrations in Blood and Feces of Adults: A Systematic Review.</a></h2><p>Short-chain   (SCFAs, mainly , propionate, and butyrate), which are primarily derived from the gut microbiome, may exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and regulate energy homeostasis. It has been suggested that weight loss may affect  metabolism, but a systematic review of intervention studies is lacking. We aimed to systematically assess the effects of dietary, physical activity-based, and surgical weight-loss interventions among overweight [body mass index (BMI) 25-29.9 kg/m2)] or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) adults (≥18 y) on concentrations of , propionate, butyrate, and total SCFAs in blood, urine, or feces.

Three of the dietary interventions that resulted in decreased  concentrations were low (≤5% of energy) in total carbohydrates. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias. Decreases in  concentrations may accompany weight loss induced by bariatric surgery or dietary restriction among overweight or obese adults, particularly when carbohydrate intake is reduced. However, findings were inconsistent and based on studies with high to unclear risk of bias, and small sample sizes. Because measurements of fecal SCFAs may not be ideal due to limited sample standardization, well-powered trials with repeated blood measurements of SCFAs are required.

In piglets, this strategy could result in a reduction of post-weaning-associated disorders and the use of antibiotics. To date, mainly purified fractions have been tested for their prebiotic effects at weaning while trials of potential health-promoting effects of products and corresponding by-products remain rare. In this study, fructan- and pectin-based ingredients have been tested in a two-step in vitro model for their fermentation kinetics as well as for their short-chain  acid production and microbiota profiles in fermentation broth as indicators for their prebiotic activity.Chicory root, in contrast to chicory pulp, exhibited an extensive and rapid fermentation similar to inulin and oligofructose, although butyrate levels of root and pulp did not reach those of the purified fractions. Chicory pulp showed higher relative levels of Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium cluster IV and butyryl-CoA:-CoA transferase gene abundance compared to chicory root. Sugar beet pulp, orange and citrus by-products displayed extensive gas fermentation patterns, equivalent to those of purified pectin, and revealed an elevated butyrate production compared to purified pectin. Moreover, several orange and citrus by-products displayed significantly higher relative levels of Bifidobacterium spp. in comparison to purified pectin.Chicory root and pulp as well as orange and citrus by-products appear to be promising ingredients for piglet diets for modulating intestinal fermentation for health purposes. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796767><i>In vitro </i>Antioxidant Activity and Profile of Polyphenol Compounds Extracts and their Fractions on Cacao Beans.</a></h2><p>The content of polyphenols in cacao beans can be modified during the processing of cacao. This study aimed to obtain the fraction of cacao bean extract polyphenols with the highest antioxidant activity and bioactive compounds profile of extracts and their fractions on cacao beans.The cacao beans (fermented for 5 days and unfermented) were blanched (5 min; 95°C), followed with defatted, freeze-dried and extracted uses 80% ethanol solvent. The extract obtained was then fractionated using n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl , n-butanol and aqueous. Extracts and fractions obtained are calculated for yield, total polyphenol uses Folin-ciocalteu reagent, total flavonoid uses AlCl3, antioxidant activity uses DPPH and FRAP methods, functional group uses fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and polyphenol compound profiles uses UHPLC-MS/MS.The results showed that the aqueous fraction had the highest yield but lowest chemical content and antioxidant activity. The unfermented cacao beans extract undergoing fractionation using ethyl  showed polyphenol content, flavonoids, DPPH free radical scavenging activity and highest ferric reducing activity. The FTIR analysis showed that the cacao bean extract and its fractions had O-H, C-H, C=O, C=C and C-O-C functional groups. Cacao beans extracts and ethyl  fractions were dominated by procyanidin compounds, especially dimer B2. Cacao bean fermentation caused a decrease in procyanidin compounds (monomer to nonamer) and alkaloids (theobromine and caffeine).Unfermented cacao bean extraction is then followed by fractionation with ethyl  solvent, obtained the fraction with highest chemical and antioxidant activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292453>Decreased maternal serum  and impaired fetal thymic and regulatory T cell development in preeclampsia.</a></h2><p>Maternal immune dysregulation seems to affect fetal or postnatal immune development. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-associated disorder with an immune basis and is linked to atopic disorders in offspring. Here we show reduction of fetal thymic size, altered thymic architecture and reduced fetal thymic regulatory T (Treg) cell output in preeclamptic pregnancies, which persists up to 4 years of age in human offspring. In germ-free mice, fetal thymic CD4 T cell and Treg cell development are compromised, but rescued by maternal supplementation with the intestinal bacterial metabolite short chain  acid () , which induces upregulation of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), known to contribute to Treg cell generation. In our human cohorts, low maternal serum  is associated with subsequent preeclampsia, and correlates with serum  in the fetus.

These microorganisms play a very important part in the development, functioning, and modulation of the immune system from the moment of birth. In recent years, owing to the use of modern sequencing techniques, the microbiome composition in healthy people has been identified based on bacterial 16S rRNA analysis. Currently, more and more attention is being given to the influence of microorganisms on the host's cellular metabolism. Analysis of microbial metabolites, among them short-chain   (SCFAs), and disruption of intestinal microbiota homeostasis in terms of their effects on molecular regulatory mechanisms of immune reactions will surely improve the understanding of the etiology of many common diseases. SCFAs, mainly butyrate, propionate, and , occur in specific amounts, and their proportions can change, depending on the diet, age and diseases. The levels of SCFAs are substantially influenced by the ratio of commensal intestinal bacteria, the disturbance of which (dysbiosis) can lead to a disproportion between the SCFAs produced. SCFAs are regarded as mediators in the communication between the intestinal microbiome and the immune system. The signal they produce is transferred, among others, in immune cells via free  acid receptors (FFARs), which belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It has been also confirmed that SCFAs inhibit the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) - an enzyme involved in post-translational modifications, namely the process of deacetylation and, what is new, the process of histone crotonylation. These properties of SCFAs have an effect on their immunomodulatory potential i.e. maintaining the anti/pro-inflammatory balance. SCFAs act not only locally in the intestines colonized by commensal bacteria, but also influence the intestinal immune cells, and modulate immune response by multi-protein inflammasome complexes. SCFAs have been confirmed to contribute to the maintenance of the immune homeostasis of the urinary system (kidneys), respiratory system (lungs), central nervous system, and the sight organ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176369>Esterification of geraniol as a strategy for increasing product titre and specificity in engineered Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Geraniol, an acyclic monoterpene alcohol, is found as a primary constituent in the essential oils of plants such as geranium, lemongrass and rose. The floral-like scent of geraniol has made it a popular constituent of flavour and fragrance products. Over recent decades biotechnology has made significant progress towards the development of industrial platforms for the production of commercially valuable monoterpenoids, such as geraniol, through expression of recombinant terpene biosynthetic pathways in microbial hosts. Titres, however, have been hindered due to the inherent toxicity of these compounds-which are often utilised for anti-microbial and anti-fungal functions in their host plant.In this study we modified an Escherichia coli strain, engineered to express a heterologous mevalonate pathway, by replacement of the terpene synthase with a geraniol synthase from Ocimum basilicum for the production of geraniol, and co-expressed an alcohol acyltransferase (AAT) from Rosa hybrida for the specific acetylation of geraniol. The low water solubility of geranyl  facilitated its partition into the organic phase of a two-phase system, relieving the cellular toxicity attributed to the build-up of geraniol in the aqueous phase. In a partially optimised system this strain produced 4.8 g/L geranyl  (based on the aqueous volume) which, on a molar equivalent basis, represents the highest monoterpene titre achieved from microbial culture to date. It was also found that esterification of geraniol prevented bioconversion into other monoterpenoids, leading to a significant improvement in product specificity, with geranyl  being the sole product observed.In this study we have shown that it is possible to both overcome the toxicity limit impeding the production of the monoterpene alcohol geraniol and mitigate product loss in culture through endogenous metabolism by using an in vivo esterification strategy. This strategy has resulted in the highest geraniol (equivalent) titres achieved from a microbial host, and presents esterification as a viable approach to increasing the titres obtained in microbial monoterpenoid production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31193871>Effect of traditional Chinese medicine compounds on rumen fermentation, methanogenesis and microbial flora .</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to investigate the effects of traditional Chinese medicine compounds (TCMC) on rumen fermentation, methane emission and populations of ruminal microbes using an  gas production technique. Cablin patchouli herb (CPH), Atractylodes rhizome (AR), Amur Cork-tree (AC) and Cypsum were mixed with the weight ratios of 1:1:1:0.5 and 1:1:1:1 to make up TCMC1 and TCMC2, respectively. Both TCMC were added at level of 25 g/kg of substrate dry matter.  gas production was recorded and methane concentration was determined at 12 and 24 h of incubation. After 24 h, the incubation was terminated and the inoculants were measured for pH, ammonia nitrogen,  (VFA). Total deoxyribonucleic acid of ruminal microbes was extracted from the inocula, and populations were determined by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Populations of total rumen methanogens, protozoa, total fungi, ,  and  were expressed as a proportion of total rumen bacterial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid. Compared with the control, the 2 TCMC decreased ( ≤ 0.05) total VFA concentration,  molar proportion,  to propionate ratio, gas and methane productions at 12 and 24 h, hydrogen (H) produced and consumed, and methanogens and total fungi populations, while the 2 TCMC increased ( ≤ 0.05) propionate molar proportion. Traditional Chinese medicine compound 1 also decreased ( ≤ 0.05)  population. From the present study, it is inferred that there is an effect of the TCMC in suppressing methanogenesis, probably mediated via indirect mode by channeling H utilized for methanogenesis to synthesis of propionate and direct action against the rumen microbes involved in methane formation. In addition, the relative methane reduction potential (RMRP) of TCMC2 was superior to that of TCMC1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174754>Alcohol acyltransferase gene and ester precursors differentiate composition of  esters in three interspecific hybrids of Vitis labrusca × V.

Twenty-four Holstein calves (2 d old) in hutches were used in a 12-wk randomized complete block design study. Calves were blocked by birth date and sex. Treatments were (1) control (CON) with no supplement and (2) 50 g/d of CWS. Preweaning CWS was fed with milk and postweaning CWS was top-dressed on starter pellets. Calves were fed 2.83 L of pasteurized milk 2×/d during wk 1 to 5, 1×/d in wk 6, and weaned at d 42. Calves had ad libitum access to starter pellets and water. Individual intakes of milk and starter pellets were measured daily. Fecal scores (0 = firm, 3 = watery) and respiratory scores (healthy ≤3, sick ≥5), calculated from the sum of scores for rectal temperature, cough, ocular, and nasal discharge, were recorded daily. Body weights (BW), frame growth, and jugular blood samples were taken once every week at 3 h after the morning feeding. Fecal grab samples were collected in wk 12 for analysis of apparent total-tract digestibility. Data were analyzed using MIXED procedures of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with repeated measures. Total dry matter intake was greater in calves fed CWS compared with CON. Calves fed CWS tended to have greater BW during the postweaning period. Gain:feed, average daily gains, withers heights, and concentrations of plasma urea nitrogen were not different. Concentrations of plasma β-hydroxybutyrate were greater in calves fed CWS compared with CON. Serum glucose concentrations were greater in calves fed CON during the preweaning stage, but similar concentrations were found between treatments during the postweaning stage. Rumen pH, ammonia-N, and total  were similar between treatments. The :propionate ratio was greater in calves fed CWS. The apparent total-tract digestion of nutrients was similar; however, CON tended to have greater digestion of neutral detergent fiber. Fecal scores were not different, but a treatment by week interaction was observed. Supplementing CWS improved starter intake, postweaning BW, β-hydroxybutyrate, fecal scores, and maintained frame growth.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This lack of specificity limits applications in which biosensors may be deployed, such as those where an unknown feed substrate must be determined. The application of genomic data and well-developed data mining technologies can overcome these limitations and advance engineering development. In the present study, 69 samples with three different substrate types (, carbohydrates and wastewater) collected from various laboratory environments were evaluated to determine the ability to identify feed substrates from the resultant microbial communities. Six machine learning algorithms with four different input variables were trained and evaluated on their ability to predict feed substrate from genomic datasets. The highest accuracies of 93 ± 6% and 92 ± 5% were obtained using NNET trained on datasets classified at the phylum and family taxonomic level, respectively. These accuracies corresponded to kappa values of 0.87 ± 0.10, 0.86 ± 0.09, respectively. Four out of six of the algorithms used maintained accuracies above 80% and kappa values higher than 0.66. Different sequencing method (Roche 454 or Illumina sequencing) did not affect the accuracies of all algorithms, except SVM at the phylum level. All algorithms trained on NMDS-compressed datasets obtained accuracies over 80%, while models trained on PCoA-compressed datasets presented a 10-30% reduction in accuracy. These results suggest that incorporating microbial community data with machine learning algorithms can be used for the prediction of feed substrate and for the potential improvement of MFC-based biosensor signal specificity, providing a new use of machine learning techniques that has substantial practical applications in biotechnological fields.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Samples were collected at both of 14 and 35 D. Neither growth performance nor ileal parameters (length, weight, and pH) at both of 14 and 35 D was affected by dietary RPS. However, the mucosal thickness (14 D), villus height (except for 18% RPS at 14 D), and the villus height: crypt depth ratio (14 and 35 D) of the ileum were increased in the 12 and 18% RPS diets when compared to 0% RPS diet. Meanwhile, proinflammatory factors such as plasma interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 (14 D) reduced in 12% RPS diet and tumor necrosis factor α decreased in 12% (except for 14 D) and 18% RPS groups. When compared with the control group, diets with 18% RPS significantly increased mucin 2 gene expression at 14 D, and 12% RPS elevated the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins including Zonula occludens-1 and Claudin 1 (except for 14 D) in the ileal mucosa of birds. Furthermore, ducks fed 12% RPS diet had higher concentrations of , propionate, and butyrate in cecal digesta than other groups.

A week after parturition, cows were grouped into three treatments of 10 cows each and fed a control treatment containing corn silage at 300 g/kg DM. In the other treated diets, 50% or 100% of the control corn silage was substituted with beet tops silage treated with LAB included at 150 g or 300 g per kg diet. Ensiling of beet tops with LAB decreased its contents of oxalic acid and neutral detergent and acid detergent fibers but increased its contents of non-structural carbohydrate and calcium. Without affecting daily milk production and feed efficiency, beet tops silage treated with LAB diets decreased ( < 0.05) feed intake, total ruminal ,  and propionate concentrations, energy-corrected milk yield and concentrations of milk total solids, fat, protein and energy. In conclusion, beet tops silage treated with LAB can replace corn silage in diets of lactating cows.

Fermentation of carbohydrates in the rumen results in the formation of VFA with hydrogen (H2) as a byproduct that is used for CH4 formation. Generally, fermentation pathways leading to  are associated with the most H2 production, less H2 formation is associated with butyrate production, and propionate and valerate production are associated with reduced H2 production. Therefore, VFA may constitute a potential correlated proxy for CH4 emissions to enable high-throughput animal screening. The objective of the present study was to determine the genetic parameters for ruminal and plasma VFA concentrations in sheep fed alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) pellets and their genetic (rg) and phenotypic (rp) correlations with CH4 emissions. Measurements of CH4 emissions in respiration chambers and ruminal (stomach tubing 18 h from last meal) and blood plasma (3 h post-feeding) VFA concentrations were made on 1,538 lambs from 5 birth years (2007 and 2009 to 2012) aged between 5 and 10 mo, while the animals were fed alfalfa pellets at 2.0 times maintenance requirements in 2 equal size meals (0900 and 1500 h). These measurements were repeated twice (rounds) 14 d apart. Mean (± SD) CH4 production was 24.4 ± 3.08 g/d, and the mean CH4 yield was 15.8 ± 1.51 g/kg DMI. Mean concentration of total ruminal VFA was 52.2 mM, with concentrations of , propionate and butyrate of 35.97, 8.83, and 4.02 mM, respectively. Ruminal total VFA concentration had heritability (h2) and repeatability estimates (± SE) of 0.24 ± 0.05 and 0.35 ± 0.03, respectively, and similar estimates were found for , propionate, and butyrate. Blood plasma concentrations of VFA had much lower estimates of h2 and repeatability than ruminal VFA. Genetic correlations with CH4 yield were greatest for total concentrations of ruminal VFA and , with 0.54 ± 0.12 and 0.56 ± 0.12, respectively, which were much greater than their corresponding rp. The rp and rg of ruminal VFA proportions and blood VFAs with CH4 emissions were in general lower than for ruminal VFA concentrations.

In the first of three trials, whole-crop maize silage was supplemented with different concentrations of EA and EL and then vacuum-stored before use. Forages sampled during the preference trial showed a good recovery of EL with a high accordance of target (naturally formed + supplemented) and analysed concentrations. Supplemented EA was not recovered, making transient storage of substrates before use in feeding trials equivocal. However, four treatments with different concentrations of EL (approximately 330, 560, 920 and 1300 mg/kg dry matter (DM)) were used for the preference trial. In Trials 2 and 3, EA and EL (with and without ethanol, respectively) were added to grass hay directly before offering the feed, each in concentrations of 0, 600 and 1200 mg/kg DM to have six treatments each. In all trials, each possible combination of treatments was offered to Saanen-type wethers (n = 10, Trial 1; n = 5, Trials 2 and 3) as free choice in preference trials. In Trial 1, there was only a weak impact of EL on preference behaviour as goats avoided medium EL concentrations, but did not avoid silages with higher concentrations. In Trials 2 and 3, there was no influence of added volatiles on short-term DM intake and preference at all. It can be concluded that it is unlikely that ethyl esters as single substance or in combination with ethanol affect preference behaviour and feed intake of ruminants. Possibly a combination or still unidentified fermentation products cause avoidance instead of a single compound.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954891>Regulating role of ethyl  fraction of Tephrosia tinctoria pers. in carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative stress in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Traditionally, Tephrosia tinctoria (TT) is used as antimicrobial, larvicidal, antidiabetic and antioxidant agents. In the present study, the diabetes was induced in male albino - rats using alloxan (140 mg/kg b.w.) and treated with ethyl  extract (100 and 200 mg/kg b.w.) of T. tinctoria (TTEA) orally for 28 days. The effects of TTEA on biochemical paramets were studied. The results of this comprehensive study revealed that the TTEA significantly restored the altered parameters in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The diabetes-induced elevated levels of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis metabolism were significantly controlled by TTEA. In the same, the decreased glycogenesis, glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolisms were significantly increased by TTEA. The enzymatic and non- enzymatic antioxidant levels were significantly elevated in TTEA treated diabetic rats and also the total non-enzymatic antioxidants capacity of serum and liver homogenate were calculated though DPPH inhibition. To conclude, this study demonstrates the anti-diabetic effect of TTEA possibly mediated through regulating carbohydrate metabolism and antioxidant status.Copyright © 2019.

II: Impact on   acid absorption.</a></h2><p>Diet is known to affect rumen growth and development. Calves fed an all-liquid diet have smaller and less developed rumens and a decreased ability to absorb  (VFA) compared to calves fed both liquid and dry feed. However, it is unknown how rumens respond when challenged with a defined concentration of VFA. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of 2 different feeding programs on VFA absorption in preweaned calves. Neonatal Holstein bull calves were individually housed and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 diets. The diets were milk replacer only (MRO; n = 5) or milk replacer with starter (MRS; n = 6). Diets were isoenergetic (3.87 ± 0.06 Mcal of metabolizable energy per day) and isonitrogenous (0.17 ± 0.003 kg/d of apparent digestible protein). Milk replacer was 22% crude protein, 21.5% fat (dry matter basis). The textured calf starter was 21.5% crude protein (dry matter basis). Feed and ad libitum water intakes were recorded daily. Calves were exposed to a defined concentration of VFA buffer ( 143 mM, propionate 100 mM, butyrate 40.5 mM) 6 h before euthanasia on d 43 ± 1. Rumen fluid samples were obtained every 15 to 30 min for 6 h to measure the rate of VFA absorption. Rumen tissues were obtained from the ventral sac region and processed for morphological and immunohistochemical analyses of the VFA transporters monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and 4 (MCT4). Body growth did not differ between diets, but empty reticulorumens were heavier in MRS than MRO calves (0.67 vs. 0.39 ± 0.04 kg) and MRS calves had larger papillae areas (0.76 vs. 15 ± 0.08 mm). We observed no differences between diets in terms of the abundance of MCT1 and MCT4 per unit area. These results indicate that the extrapolated increase in total abundance of MCT1 or MCT4 in MRS calves was not due to increased transporter density per unit area. Modeled VFA absorption metrics (flux, mmol/h, or 6 h absorbed VFA in mmol) were not different across diets. These results demonstrate that the form of calfhood diet, whether solely MR or MR and starter, does not alter VFA absorption capacity when the rumen is exposed to a defined concentration of VFA at 6 wk of age.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Small-tailed Han sheep were introduced to the plateau and are raised mainly in feedlots. Based on their different backgrounds, we hypothesized that the ability to cope with poor diets would be better in Tibetan than in Han sheep. To test our prediction, we examined the effect of dietary energy on apparent digestibilities, rumen fermentation, urinary purine derivatives and serum metabolites by using a 4 × 4 Latin square design in each sheep breed. Four diets were formulated to be low in crude protein (~7%) but to differ in metabolizable energy concentration. Average daily gain was greater in Tibetan than in Han sheep (p < 0.01) and increased linearly with an increase in energy intake (p < 0.001). The digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, gross energy, and neutral and acid detergent fibres were greater in Tibetan than in Han sheep (p < 0.05). Ruminal pH was lower (p < 0.05), while  (VFAs), urea-N, ammonia-N and soluble protein-N concentrations were higher (p < 0.05) in Tibetan than in Han sheep. As a molar proportion of total VFA,  decreased (p < 0.001) with an increase in dietary energy whereas propionate and butyrate increased (p < 0.05). Urinary purine derivative excretion was greater in Tibetan than in Han sheep (p < 0.01), as was microbial nitrogen production; both parameters increased with dietary energy (p < 0.01). Serum concentrations of glucose, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 increased (p < 0.05) as energy level increased, while non-esterified   and growth hormone decreased (p < 0.05). It was concluded that Tibetan sheep were better able to cope with low-protein, low-energy diets and, consequently, our prediction was supported.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30786698>Ammonium  Supplement Strategy for Enhancement of Chaetominine Production in Liquid Culture of Marine-Derived  CY018.</a></h2><p>Pharmacological research on (CHA), a marine-derived quinazolinone alkaloid with significant cytotoxic activity, is restricted by low yields and is a problem that needs to be settled urgently. In this work, the selection of additional nitrogen sources and the optimization of additional concentrations and longer fermentation times using ammonium , were investigated. CHA production was optimized to 62.1 mg/l with the addition of 50 mM ammonium  at 120 h of the fermentation in the shaker flask. This feeding strategy significantly increased 3- deoxy-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase activity and transcript levels of critical genes (,  and ) in the shikimate pathway compared with the non-treatment group. In addition, the selection of the feeding rate (0.01 and 0.03 g/l/h) was investigated in a 5-L bioreactor. As a result, CHA production was increased by 57.9 mg/l with a 0.01 g/l/h ammonium  feeding rate. This work shows that the strategy of ammonium  supplementation had an effective role in improving CHA production by  CY018. It also shows that this strategy could serve as an important example of large-scale fermentation of a marine fungus in submerged culture.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195972>Changes in the gut microbiome and fermentation products concurrent with enhanced longevity in acarbose-treated mice.</a></h2><p>Treatment with the α-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose increases median lifespan by approximately 20% in male mice and 5% in females. This longevity extension differs from dietary restriction based on a number of features, including the relatively small effects on weight and the sex-specificity of the lifespan effect. By inhibiting host digestion, acarbose increases the flux of starch to the lower digestive system, resulting in changes to the gut microbiota and their fermentation products. Given the documented health benefits of short-chain   (SCFAs), the dominant products of starch fermentation by gut bacteria, this secondary effect of acarbose could contribute to increased longevity in mice. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the fecal microbiome of mice treated with acarbose to control mice at three independent study sites.Microbial communities and the concentrations of SCFAs in the feces of mice treated with acarbose were notably different from those of control mice. At all three study sites, the bloom of a single bacterial taxon was the most obvious response to acarbose treatment. The blooming populations were classified to the largely uncultured Bacteroidales family Muribaculaceae and were the same taxonomic unit at two of the three sites. Propionate concentrations in feces were consistently elevated in treated mice, while the concentrations of  and butyrate reflected a dependence on study site. Across all samples, Muribaculaceae abundance was strongly correlated with propionate and community composition was an important predictor of  concentrations. Cox proportional hazards regression showed that the fecal concentrations of , butyrate, and propionate were, together, predictive of mouse longevity even while controlling for sex, site, and acarbose.We observed a correlation between fecal SCFAs and lifespan in mice, suggesting a role of the gut microbiota in the longevity-enhancing properties of acarbose. Treatment modulated the taxonomic composition and fermentation products of the gut microbiome, while the site-dependence of the responses illustrate the challenges facing reproducibility and interpretation in microbiome studies. These results motivate future studies exploring manipulation of the gut microbial community and its fermentation products for increased longevity, testing causal roles of SCFAs in the observed effects of acarbose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618992>Effect of Native and Acetylated Dietary Resistant Starches on Intestinal Fermentative Capacity of Normal and Stunted Children in Southern India.</a></h2><p>The health benefits of dietary amylase resistant starch (RS) arise from intestinal microbial fermentation and generation of short chain   (). We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged 2 to 5 years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a 2-week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for 2 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and  analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower  concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal  and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both  and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS. Stunted children have impaired capacity to ferment certain types of RS which has implications for choice of RS in formulations aimed at improving microbial function in stunted children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30816043>Fed-Batch and Sequential-Batch Approaches To Enhance the Bioproduction of 2-Phenylethanol and 2-Phenethyl  in Solid-State Fermentation Residue-Based Systems.</a></h2><p>This study describes the use of alternative operational strategies in the solid-state fermentation of the agro-industrial leftover sugar cane bagasse (SCB) supplemented with l-phenylalanine, for bioproducing natural 2-phenylethanol (2-PE) and 2-phenethyl  (2-PEA) using K. marxianus. Here, fed-batch and sequential-batch have been assessed at two scales (1.6 and 22 L) as tools to increase the production, as well as to enhance the sustainability of this residue-based process. While in the reference batch strategy a maximum of 17 mg of 2-PE+2-PEA per gram of added SCB was reached at both scales, the implementation of fed-batch mode induced a production increase of 11.6% and 12.5%, respectively. Also, the production was increased by 16.9% and 2.4% as compared to the batch when a sequential-batch mode was used. Furthermore, the use of these strategies was accompanied by lower consumption of key resources like the inoculum, air, and time, promoting savings between 22% and 76% at both scales.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498864>Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Short-Chain  Acid Characterization in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Alterations in gut microbiota and short-chain   (SCFAs) have been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the results are conflicting. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to explore the characterization of SCFAs in IBD patients and their potential role in the occurrence and development of IBD.Case-control studies investigating SCFAs in IBD patients were identified from several English databases. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the random-effects model.The SMDs of , valerate, and total SCFAs in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were -0.51 (95% CI, -0.90 to -0.13), -0.65 (95% CI, -1.02 to -0.28), and -0.51 (95% CI, -0.95 to -0.07), respectively.

These vectors occur mainly in tropical countries where more than 2 billion people live in endemic regions with about one million deaths been claimed yearly from malaria and filariasis. The study is aimed at evaluating the larvicidal activity of Pistia stratiotes fractions on Anopheles mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae). The ethyl  extract of P. stratiotes was obtained through percolation process and was chromatographed to yield nine fractions. The larvicidal activity of each of the nine fractions was tested in triplicates by exposing the larvae to 500, 250, 125, 62.5 and 31.3 µg/ml, respectively. Phytochemical screening of the nine fractions revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides and phlobatannins in varying quantities. The result obtained shows that fraction E has the highest lethal effect on the Anopheles larvae at LC =14.81 µg/ml and was weakly effective at 602.03 µg/ml on brine shrimp larvae. The gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of fraction E revealed the presence of 35 pre-cursor compounds. Hence, ethyl  fractions of P. stratiotes could be an effective larvicide against Anopheles mosquito larvae as it has been found to be harmless to other aquatic organisms. Further work should be done on other aquatic weeds that have larvicidal potential to isolate the bioactive compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972704>Response of Propionate-Degrading Methanogenic Microbial Communities to Inhibitory Conditions.</a></h2><p>Propionate is a crucial intermediate during methane fermentation.

In the present study, under inhibitory conditions (, propionate, sulfide, and ammonium addition), the dynamic changes of the propionate-degrading microbial community from a mesophilic chemostat fed with propionate as the sole carbon source were investigated using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA. Sulfide and/or ammonia inhibited specific species in the microbial community. Compared with Syntrophobacter, Smithella was more resistant to inhibition by sulfide and/or ammonia. However, Syntrophobacter demonstrated greater tolerance than Smithella under acid inhibition conditions. Some genera that had close phylogenetic relationships and similar functions showed similar responses to different inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31073613>Effects of thermally oxidized canola oil and tannic acid supplementation on nutrient digestibility and microbial metabolites in finishing pigs1.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated the effects of oxidized canola oil and tannic acid (TA) supplementation on nutrient digestibility and microbial metabolites in finishing pigs. Four experimental diets were formulated to include 5% of either fresh canola oil (0 mEq/kg of peroxide value) or oxidized canola oil (180 mEq/kg of peroxide value). An equal portion of each diet was supplemented with 0.1% TA. Eight pigs (initial body weight of 82.89 ± 2.26 kg) were surgically fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum. At the beginning of the experiments, all pigs were fed a nitrogen-free diet for 7 d. Then, they were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to an incomplete replicated 4 × 3 Latin square design with 3 periods to give 6 replicates per treatment. Each experimental period lasted for 9 d, starting with a 5-d adaptation period followed by 2 consecutive 2-d periods for fecal (day 6 and day 7) and ileal digesta (day 8 and day 9) collection. The inclusion of oxidized oil reduced (P < 0.05) the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Pro and the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of NDF. Also, pigs fed the oxidized oil tended to have lower (P ≤ 0.10) lactate and ammonia-nitrogen concentrations in the ileum and lower (P ≤ 0.10)  and propionate concentrations in the feces than those fed the fresh oil. The supplementation of 0.1% TA reduced (P < 0.05) the AID of NDF and the ATTD of gross energy, crude protein, and NDF. Additionally, the TA-supplemented diet tended to have a lower (P ≤ 0.10) digestible energy content than the nonsupplemented diet. Pigs fed the TA-supplemented diet showed reduced (P < 0.05) AID and SID of His, Cys, and Pro compared with those fed the nonsupplemented diet. There were interactive effects (P < 0.05) of oxidized oil and TA supplementation on , isovalerate, total short chain  , and pH level in the ileum. In conclusion, the results indicated that the effects of oxidized oil are greater on microbial activities rather than nutrient digestibility. Although negative effects of dietary TA supplementation were observed in relation to nutrient digestibility, TA supplementation was found to ameliorate these negative effects of oxidized oil on microbial metabolites. Therefore, further studies are required to investigate the interaction between dietary oxidized oil and TA in relation with the gut microbiota in pigs.© The Author(s) 2019.

Four dietary supplementation treatments were imposed; non-supplementation (control, T1); supplementation of RP fed at 2% of DMI (low, T2); supplementation of RP fed at 4% of DMI (medium, T3) and supplementation of RP fed at 6% of DMI (high, T4). All cattle were given a concentrate supplement at 1 % of body weight while Napier grass was provided as a free choice.The findings revealed that RP supplementation did not negatively affect (P>0.05) DM intake of Napier grass, while RP intake and total DMI were the greatest in the RP supplementation at 4 and 6%DMI. Nevertheless, the nutrients (DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF) digestibilities were not changed in the RP supplementation groups.

Colorectal adenomatous polyps are at high risk for the development of CRC. In this report, we described the metabolic changes in the sera from patients with colorectal polyps and CRC by using the NMR-based metabolomics. 110 serum samples were collected from patients and healthy controls, including 40 CRC patients, 32 colorectal polyp patients, and 38 healthy controls. The metabolic profiles and differential metabolites of sera were analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis (MSA), including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) methods. A total of 23 differential metabolites were identified from MSA. According to the pathway analysis and multivariate ROC curve-based exploratory analysis by using the relative concentrations of differential metabolites, we found abnormal metabolic pathways and potential biomarkers involved with the colorectal polyp and CRC. The results showed that the pyruvate metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism were activated in colorectal polyps. And the glycolysis and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were activated in CRC. The changed metabolism may promote cellular proliferation. In addition, we found that the rates of /glycerol and lactate/citrate could be the potential biomarkers in colorectal polyp and CRC, respectively.

Yaks do not receive supplementary feed whereas cattle require supplementary feed during harsh winter. We hypothesized that yaks would cope with the severe conditions of the QTP better than cattle and utilize the pasture more efficiently.

Concentrations of total VFA, , propionate and butyrate decreased linearly (p < 0.05), whereas concentrations of isobutyrate and isovalerate increased linearly for yak and C × Y with sampling time (p < 0.05) in summer. In summer, concentrations of isobutyrate and isovalerate were greater in yaks than in cattle (p < 0.05). In conclusion, rumen fermentation characteristics of yaks showed that they coped better than cattle or C × Y in the harsh climate as we hypothesized. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, this emerged only in summer, when pasture was plentiful and not in winter, when pasture was scarce.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31013911>Comparison of Two Process Schemes Combining Hydrothermal Treatment and Acidogenic Fermentation of Source-Separated Organics.</a></h2><p>This study compares the effects of pre- and post-hydrothermal treatment of source- separated organics (SSO) on solubilization of particulate organics and acidogenic fermentation for  (VFAs) production. The overall COD solubilization and solids removal efficiencies from both schemes were comparable. However, the pre-hydrolysis of SSO followed by acidogenic fermentation resulted in a relatively higher VFA yield of 433 mg/g VSS, which was 18% higher than that of a process scheme with a post-hydrolysis of dewatered solids from the fermentation process. Regarding the composition of VFA, the dominance of  and butyrate was comparable in both process schemes, while propionate concentration considerably increased in the process with pre-hydrolysis of SSO. The microbial community results showed that the relative abundance of  increased substantially in the fermentation of pretreated SSO, indicating that there might be different metabolic pathways for production of VFAs in fermentation process operated with pre-treated SSO. The possible reason might be that the abundance of soluble organic matters due to pre-hydrolysis might stimulate the growth of more kinetically efficient fermentative bacteria as indicated by the increase in  percentage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30778768>Dietary supplementation with fermented Mao-tai lees beneficially affects gut microbiota structure and function in pigs.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota positively contribute to livestock nutrition and metabolism. The manipulation of these microbes may improve animal health. Some feed additives improve livestock health and metabolism by regulating gut microbiota composition and activity. We fed hybrid pigs diets supplemented with 0% (control), 5% (treat 1), 10% (treat 2), or 15% (treat 3) fermented Mao-tai lees (FML) for 90 days. Short-chain   (SCFAs), bioamines, and microbial communities found in colonic contents were analyzed to investigate microbiota composition and metabolic profiles. Concentrations of straight-chain   (e.g., , propionate, and butyrate) and tyramine increased with FML supplementation content. Contrary to the minor effects of 5% and 10% FML on gut microbiota, 15% FML influenced beta diversity (Jaccard or Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) but not alpha diversity (number of operational taxonomic units and Shannon diversity) of pig gut microbial communities compared to the control group. Notably, 15% FML animals were characterized by a higher abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus and Akkermansia) but lower abundances of potential pathogens (Escherichia). Numerous genes associated with metabolism (e.g., starch, sucrose, and sulfur-compounds metabolism) showed a higher relative abundance in the 15% FML than in the control group. Additionally, most Phascolarctobacterium, Treponema, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium bacterial markers in the 15% FML group were positively correlated with straight-chain  acid concentrations, suggesting that these bacteria are likely associated with  production. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the beneficial effects of 15% FML on fermentation of undigested compounds and gut microbiota composition in the colon. Thus, 15% FML supplementation in pig feed may possibly represent a way to optimize pig colon health for livestock farming.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376665>Concentrating lactate-carbon flow on medium chain carboxylic  production by hydrogen supply.</a></h2><p>Upgrading lactate/carbohydrate-rich waste biomass into medium-chain carboxylic  (MCCAs) by chain elongation (CE) technology exhibits economic and environmental benefits. However, the largely dispersive lactate-carbon-flow decreases MCCAs yield. This work discovered appropriate H supply could significantly reduce lactate-carbon-flow loss and improve MCCAs production (∼1.65 times) when the system is not operated according to well-defined operating conditions, and revealed corresponding mechanism. Hydrogen (H) supply largely enhanced electron efficiency and electron transfer capacity, and H could reduce propionate (from competing acrylate pathway, which should be prevented, but when not possible, the carbon recovery from propionate is possible) to propanol, which was used as electron donor to elongate  and propionate. Moreover, H could react with CO (from CE process) to sequentially generate  and ethanol, which further contributed to caproate/caprylate generation. Comparing with non-H-supplemented test, the lactate-carbon-flow used for MCCAs production was enhanced by ∼28.4% after H supply, and Clostridium spp. were the key discriminative microorganisms.Copyright © 2019.

A total of 324 1-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly assigned to three treatments with six cages of 18 chicks. Treatments were: (a) Control, 80 mg/kg Zn from ZnSO ; (b) POS, 80 mg/kg Zn from ZnSO + 482 mg/kg POS (the same amount of POS as treatment 3); and (c) Zn-POS, 80 mg/kg zinc from Zn-POS. Compared to the Control, both POS and Zn-POS supplementation increased average daily gain and reduced the mortality during day 22-42, and only Zn-POS supplementation decreased the ratio of feed to gain during day 22-42 and 1-42. Moreover, both POS and Zn-POS supplementation improved Zn status and gut function as evidenced by increased metallothionein concentrations in the pancreas, villus height in the duodenum and isobutyrate concentrations in the caecal digesta. Additionally, Zn-POS supplementation increased gene expressions of metallothionein, Zn transporter 1, Zn transporter 2 in the pancreas, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 in the liver, the concentrations of , propionate, butyrate and total  in the caecal digesta and the villus height to crypt depth ratio in the duodenum and jejunum, whereas decreased the crypt depth in these two tissues. Altogether, our results revealed that dietary POS or Zn-POS supplementation benefited growth performance, Zn status, antioxidant ability and gut function of broilers. Supplementing Zn-POS in the form of chelate was more effective than feeding POS or ZnSO separately.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30904293>Invited review: Plant polyphenols and rumen microbiota responsible for  acid biohydrogenation, fiber digestion, and methane emission: Experimental evidence and methodological approaches.</a></h2><p>The interest of the scientific community in the effects of plant polyphenols on animal nutrition is increasing. These compounds, in fact, are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, especially in some spontaneous plants exploited as feeding resources alternative to cultivated crops and in several agro-industry by-products. Polyphenols interact with rumen microbiota, affecting carbohydrate fermentation, protein degradation, and lipid metabolism. Some of these aspects have been largely reviewed, especially for tannins; however, less information is available about the direct effect of polyphenols on the composition of rumen microbiota. In the present paper, we review the most recent literature about the effect of plant polyphenols on rumen microbiota responsible for unsaturated  acid biohydrogenation, fiber digestion, and methane production, taking into consideration the advances in microbiota analysis achieved in the last 10 yr. Key aspects, such as sample collection, sample storage, DNA extraction, and the main phylogenetic markers used in the reconstruction of microbial community structure, are examined. Furthermore, a summary of the new high-throughput methods based on next generation sequencing is reviewed. Several effects can be associated with dietary polyphenols. Polyphenols are able to depress or modulate the biohydrogenation of unsaturated   by a perturbation of ruminal microbiota composition. In particular, condensed tannins have an inhibitory effect on biohydrogenation, whereas hydrolyzable tannins seem to have a modulatory effect on biohydrogenation. With regard to fiber digestion, data from literature are quite consistent about a general depressive effect of polyphenols on gram-positive fibrolytic bacteria and ciliate protozoa, resulting in a reduction of   acid production (mostly  molar production). Methane production is also usually reduced when tannins are included in the diet of ruminants, probably as a consequence of the inhibition of fiber digestion. However, some evidence suggests that hydrolyzable tannins may reduce methane emission by directly interacting with rumen microbiota without affecting fiber digestion.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Botanical air filtration is a promising technology for reducing indoor air contaminants, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study assessed active botanical biofilters for their single-pass removal efficiency (SPRE) for benzene, ethyl  and ambient total  organic compounds (TVOCs), at concentrations of in situ relevance. Biofilters containing four plant species (Chlorophytum orchidastrum, Nematanthus glabra, Nephrolepis cordifolia 'duffii' and Schefflera arboricola) were compared to discern whether plant selection influenced VOC SPRE. Amongst all tested plant species, benzene SPREs were between 45.54 and 59.50%, with N. glabra the most efficient. The botanical biofilters removed 32.36-91.19% of ethyl , with C. orchidastrum and S. arboricola recording significantly higher ethyl  SPREs than N. glabra and N. cordifolia. These findings thus indicate that plant type influences botanical biofilter VOC removal. It is proposed that ethyl  SPREs were dependent on hydrophilic adsorbent sites, with increasing root surface area, root diameter and root mass all associated with increasing ethyl  SPRE. The high benzene SPRE of N. glabra is likely due to the high wax content in its leaf cuticles. The SPREs for the relatively low levels of ambient TVOCs were consistent amongst plant species, providing no evidence to suggest that in situ TVOC removal is influenced by plant choice. Nonetheless, as inter-species differences do exist for some VOCs, botanical biofilters using a mixture of plants is proposed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30892391>Effect of ethyl  extract of usnea longissima on esophagogastric adenocarcinoma in rats1.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of the EtOAc extract of U. longissima which is uninvestigated previously on esophagogastric cancer induced in rats with N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidin (MNNG).The anticancer activity of EtOAc extract of U. longissima was examined in the esophagogastric adenocarcinoma models induced in rats with MNNG.

Hence, this study was conducted to determine the effects of Enterococcus faecium SROD on in vitro rumen fermentation, methane concentration, and microbial population structure. Ruminal samples were collected from ruminally cannulated Holstein-Friesian cattle, and 40:60 rice straw to concentrate ratio was used as substrate. Fresh culture of E. faecium SROD at different inclusion rates (0, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%) were investigated using in vitro rumen fermentation system. Addition of E. faecium SROD had a significant effect on total gas production with the greatest effect observed with 0.1% supplementation; however, there was no significant influence on pH. Supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest propionate (P = 0.005) but the lowest methane concentration (P = 0.001). In addition, , butyrate, and total VFA concentrations in treatments were comparatively higher than control. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the predominance of the bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the archaeal phylum Euryarchaeota. At the genus level, Prevotella (15-17%) and Methanobrevibacter (96%) dominated the bacterial and archaeal communities of the in vitro rumen fermenta, respectively. Supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest quantities of total bacteria and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, whereas 1.0% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest contents of total fungi and Fibrobacter succinogenes. Overall, supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD significantly increased the propionate and total  concentrations but decreased the methane concentration while changing the microbial community abundance and composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30965280>Dynamic changes in fermentation profiles and bacterial community composition during sugarcane top silage fermentation: A preliminary study.</a></h2><p>Investigating the dynamic changes in bacterial community composition during sugarcane top silage production starting in late March and finishing in late June (storage temperature: 20 to 35 °C) will advance our understanding of ensilage in hot ambient temperatures. The results showed that, the fermentation process was dominated by Leuconostocaceae (until d 5), followed by Lactobacillaceae (from d 5 to d 30), and finally Lactobacillaceae and Clostridium (from d 60 to d 90). As the fermentation process progressed, there was a significant increase in Lactobacillaceae abundance, and on d 60 there was a sharp increase in Clostridiaceae abundance. Spearman's correlation showed that, Lactococcus and Leuconostoc abundance were negatively correlated with , propionate, butyrate, and ammonia-N levels. Clostridiaceae and Lactobacillaceae abundance were positively correlated with , propionate, butyrate, and ammonia-N levels.

We recently reported a linear increase in milk fat yield and greater than a 30% net apparent transfer of  to milk fat with ruminal infusion of neutralized . Additionally, ruminal  infusion linearly increases plasma β-hydroxybutyrate. The objective of the current study was to investigate the ability of  and butyrate fed in a diet to increase milk fat synthesis. Twelve multiparous lactating Holstein cows were randomly assigned to treatments in a 3 × 3 Latin square design with 14-d periods that included a 7-d washout followed by 7 d of treatment. Cows were fed ad libitum a basal diet with a low risk for biohydrogenation-induced milk fat depression, and treatments were mixed into the basal diet. Treatments were 3.2% NaHCO (control), 2.9% sodium , and 2.5% calcium butyrate (carbon equivalent to  treatment) as a percent of diet dry matter. Feeding sodium  increased dry matter intake by 2.7 kg, had no effect on milk yield, and increased milk fat yield by 90 g/d and concentration by 0.2 percentage units, compared with control. Calcium butyrate decreased dry matter intake by 2.6 kg/d, milk yield by 1.65 kg/d, and milk fat yield by 60 g/d, compared with control. Sodium  increased concentration and yield of 16 carbon mixed source   (FA) and myristic acid, while decreasing the concentration of preformed FA, compared with control. Calcium butyrate had no effect on concentration of milk FA by source, but increased concentration of trans-10 C18:1 in milk by 18%, indicating a shift in rumen biohydrogenation pathways. Our data demonstrate that milk fat yield and concentration can be increased by feeding sodium  at 2.9% of diet dry matter, but not by feeding calcium butyrate at an equivalent carbon mass.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In this study, we aimed to examine the ability of , which can be easily generated from various resources by acetogenic microorganisms, as a substrate of Aurantiochytrium limacinum SR21. As a result of flask-scale analysis, specific growth rates (µ) of the strain SR21 grown in 3% - or glucose-based medium were 0.55 and 0.98 h, respectively. The maximum yield of total  acid in  medium was 4.8 g/L at 48 h while that in glucose medium was 6.8 g/L at 30 h, indicating that  has potential as substrate. Metabolome analysis was performed to comprehensively elucidate characteristic metabolic fluctuations caused by  assimilation and identify targets to improve the  acid productivity from . It was found that the use of glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses release of energy molecules such as NADH and GTP, and the inhibition of utilization of compounds from TCA cycle for anabolic reactions, may cause the slow growth in  which has an effect also in lipid productivity.

Short-chain   (SCFAs) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and are produced in large quantities by colonic bacteria that produce SCFAs by fermenting fiber. We assessed whether there was an association between fecal  concentrations and the presence of colonic adenomas or carcinomas in a cohort of individuals using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic shotgun sequence data. We measured the fecal concentrations of , propionate, and butyrate within the cohort and found that there were no significant associations between  concentration and tumor status. When we incorporated these concentrations into random forest classification models trained to differentiate between people with healthy colons and those with adenomas or carcinomas, we found that they did not significantly improve the ability of 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence-based models to classify individuals. Finally, we generated random forest regression models trained to predict the concentration of each  based on 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence data from the same samples. These models performed poorly and were able to explain at most 14% of the observed variation in the  concentrations. These results support the broader epidemiological data that questions the value of fiber consumption for reducing the risks of colorectal cancer. Although other bacterial metabolites may serve as biomarkers to detect adenomas or carcinomas, fecal  concentrations have limited predictive power. Considering that colorectal cancer is the third leading cancer-related cause of death within the United States, it is important to detect colorectal tumors early and to prevent the formation of tumors. Short-chain   (SCFAs) are often used as a surrogate for measuring gut health and for being anticarcinogenic because of their anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated the fecal  concentrations of a cohort of individuals with different colonic tumor burdens who were previously analyzed to identify microbiome-based biomarkers of tumors. We were unable to find an association between  concentration and tumor burden or use SCFAs to improve our microbiome-based models of classifying people based on their tumor status. Furthermore, we were unable to find an association between the fecal community structure and  concentrations. Our results indicate that the association between fecal SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and tumor burden is weak.Copyright © 2019 Sze et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332541>High efficiency transformation by electroporation of the freshwater alga Nannochloropsis limnetica.</a></h2><p>The microalgal genus of Nannochloropsis is considered one of the most promising organisms for the production of biofuels due to their high lipid content.

EAEC-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HCT116 and SW620 cells was detected using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG). The photo- and dark toxicities of EAEC were estimated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cellular uptake and localization of EAEC were detected by confocal laser fluorescence microscopy. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess apoptosis and autophagy. The antitumor activity of EAEC was confirmed in a xenograft model. Finally, effects on the PERK pathway were verified using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. EAEC displayed absorption and fluorescence emission peaks at 660 nm and 678 nm, respectively. EAEC induced ROS production in CRC cells. Assessment of dark toxicity showed that treatment with EAEC alone induced little cytotoxicity in CRC or normal cells but that EAEC-PDT induced significant photocytotoxicity in CRC cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After cellular uptake, EAEC was located in the mitochondria. Treatment with EAEC-PDT reduced xenograft tumor size. Further evaluation suggested that activation of the PERK pathway mediates these effects, as the apoptotic rate and autophagy flux increased markedly after EAEC-PDT.

The results contribute for deeper knowledge of the technological procedure, analytical characteristics, and  compounds of blueberry wines, reinforcing the interest in this beverage and opening perspectives for further studies on the production of new blueberry-based products with differential characteristics that value its nutraceutical and functional properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30964014>Investigative evaluation of  for antibacterial capacity and biomimetic synthesis of silver nanoparticles.</a></h2><p> is used for medicinal purposes for a long time all over the world. In this study, the authors report the antimicrobial potential of  extracts obtained with different solvents. The extract(s) obtained with ethyl  yielded the best antibacterial effects because of a rich supply of oxalates and alkaloids in it. The same extract was also exploited for reducing Ag ions (to metallic Ag) for the synthesis of nanoparticles. Electron microscopy revealed that the silver nanoparticles were ∼18-25 nm in diameter. The Fourier-transform infrared evaluation pointed towards the fact that flavonoids present in the plant extract were acting as reductants while amino groups were the bound stabilisation agents to the synthesised nanoparticles limiting the diameter to a certain threshold and avoiding aggregation naturally. A comparative antibacterial assay of  versus Ag nanoparticles showed that the nanoparticles as well as organic (ethyl ) extract of the plant checked the growth of selected (MDR) superbugs. However, the biosynthesised Ag nanoparticles returned better antibacterial efficacies than ethyl  extract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426593>The Short-Chain  Acid  in Body Weight Control and Insulin Sensitivity.</a></h2><p>The interplay of gut microbiota, host metabolism, and metabolic health has gained increased attention. Gut microbiota may play a regulatory role in gastrointestinal health, substrate metabolism, and peripheral tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas via its metabolites short-chain   (). Animal and human data demonstrated that, in particular,  beneficially affects host energy and substrate metabolism via secretion of the gut hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, which, thereby, affects appetite, via a reduction in whole-body lipolysis, systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and via an increase in energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Thus, potential therapies to increase gut microbial fermentation and  production have been under vigorous scientific scrutiny. In this review, the relevance of the colonically and systemically most abundant   and its effects on the previously mentioned tissues will be discussed in relation to body weight control and glucose homeostasis. We discuss in detail the differential effects of oral  administration (vinegar intake), colonic  infusions, acetogenic fiber, and acetogenic probiotic administrations as approaches to combat obesity and comorbidities. Notably, human data are scarce, which highlights the necessity for further human research to investigate 's role in host physiology, metabolic, and cardiovascular health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094471>Markers of dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to study the taxonomic and functional composition of the gut microbiota in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients to identify key markers of dysbiosis in IBD.Fecal samples obtained from 95 IBD patients (78 UC and 17 CD) as well as 96 healthy volunteers were used for whole-genome sequencing carried out on the SOLiD 5500 W platform. Taxonomic profiling was performed by aligning the reeds, not maped on hg19, on MetaPhlAn2 reference database. Reeds were mapped using the HUNAnN2 algorithm to the ChocoPhlAn database to assess the representation of microbial metabolic pathways. Short-chain   () level were measured in fecal samples by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis.Changes in IBD patients gut microbiota were characterized by an increase in the representation of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla bacteria and decrease in the number of Firmicutes phylum bacteria and Euryarchaeota phylum archaea; a decrease in the alpha-diversity index, relative representation of butyrate-producing, hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, and Methanobrevibacter smithii; increase in the relative representation of Ruminococcus gnavus in UC and CD patients and Akkermansia muciniphila in CD patients. Reduction of Butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase gene relative representation in CD patients, decrease of absolute content of  total number as well as particular SCFAs and main SCFAs ratio in IBD patients may indicate inhibition of functional activity and number of anaerobic microflora and/or an change in  utilization by colonocytes.the revealed changes can be considered as typical signs of dysbiosis in IBD patients and can be used as potential targets for IBD patients personalized treatment development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30860879>Microbiome potentiates endurance exercise through intestinal  production.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microbiome produces short-chain   (SCFAs) from dietary fiber and has specific effects on other organs. During endurance exercise,  , glucose, and amino  are major energy substrates. However, little is known about the role of SCFAs during exercise. To investigate this, mice were administered either multiple antibiotics or a low microbiome-accessible carbohydrate (LMC) diet, before endurance testing on a treadmill. Two-week antibiotic treatment significantly reduced endurance capacity versus the untreated group. In the cecum , propionate, and butyrate became almost undetectable in the antibiotic-treated group, plasma  concentrations were lower, and the microbiome was disrupted. Similarly, 6-wk LMC treatment significantly reduced exercise capacity, and fecal and plasma  concentrations. Continuous  but not saline infusion in antibiotic-treated mice restored their exercise capacity ( < 0.05), suggesting that plasma  may be an important energy substrate during endurance exercise. In addition, running time was significantly improved in LMC-fed mice by fecal microbiome transplantation from others fed a high microbiome-accessible carbohydrate diet and administered a single portion of fermentable fiber ( < 0.05). In conclusion, the microbiome can contribute to endurance exercise by producing SCFAs. Our findings provide new insight into the effects of the microbiome on systemic metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30989981>[Effects of Euphorbiae Pekinensis Radix before and after processing with vinegar on liver and gastrointestinal toxicity of zebrafish embryos].</a></h2><p>To study the effects of different fraction of Euphorbiae Pekinensis Radix before and after processing with vinegar on liver and gastrointestinal toxicity of zebrafish embryos,the zebrafish embryos after fertilized 12 h(12 hpf) were exposed to different concentrations of solution until 96 h(96 hpf),for observation of the toxicity response of the liver and gastrointestinal of individual zebrafish embryos. The results showed that toxicity increased in a dose-dependent manner. The liver and gastrointestinal toxicity of the zebrafish embryos in various polar fractions of Euphorbiae Pekinensis Radix before and after processing with vinegar was mainly manifested as slow liver development,smaller liver area,edema of yolk sac,delayed absorption,slowing of gastrointestinal motility,abnormal function of gastrointestinal goblet cell secretion. In addition,the toxicity of different polarity was followed by petroleum ether,dichloromethane,ethyl . The above results indicated that the toxicity was reduced after processing with vinegar,and the fractions of petroleum ether and methylene chloride were the main sites responsible for liver and gastrointestinal toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233266>Not-XOR (NXOR) Logic Gate Realized with Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions: Optical and Electrochemical Signal Transduction.</a></h2><p>The studied enzyme-based biocatalytic system mimics NXOR Boolean logic gate, which is a logical operator that corresponds to equality in Boolean algebra. It gives the functional value true (1) if both functional arguments (input signals) have the same logical value (0,0 or 1,1), and false (0) if they are different (0,1 or 1,0). The output signal producing reaction is catalyzed by pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH), which is inhibited at acidic and basic pH values. Two other reactions catalyzed by esterase and urease produce acetic acid and ammonium hydroxide, respectively, shifting solution pH from the optimum pH for PQQ-GDH to acidic and basic values (1,0 and 0,1 input combinations, respectively), thus switching the enzyme activity off (output 0). When the input signals are not applied (0,0 combination) or both applied compensating each other (1,1 combination) the optimum pH is preserved, thus keeping PQQ-GDH running at the high rate (output 1). The biocatalytic cascade mimicking the NXOR gate was characterized optically and electrochemically. In the electrochemical experiments the PQQ-GDH enzyme communicated electronically with a conducting electrode support, thus resulting in the electrocatalytic current when signal combinations 0,0 and 1,1 were applied. The logic gate operation, when it was realized electrochemically, was also extended to the biomolecular release controlled by the gate. The release system included two electrodes, one performing the NXOR gate and another one activated for the release upon electrochemically stimulated alginate hydrogel dissolution. The studied system represents a general approach to the biocatalytic realization of the NXOR logic gate, which can be included in different catalytic cascades mimicking operation of concatenated gates in sophisticated logic circuitries.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the current study, hydrogenotrophic Methanoculleus bourgensis was bioaugmented in an ammonia-inhibited continuous reactor fed mainly with microalgae (a protein-rich biomass), at extreme ammonia levels (i.e. 11 g NH-N L). The results showed 28% increase in methane production immediately after bioaugmentation. Moreover,  decreased rapidly from more than 5 g L to around 1 g L, with a fast reduction in propionate concentration. High throughput 16s rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the bioaugmented M. bourgensis doubled its relative abundance after bioaugmentation. "Microbiological domino effect", triggered by the bioaugmented M. bourgensis establishing a newly efficient community, was proposed as the working mechanism of the successful bioaugmentation. Additionally, a strong aceticlastic methanogenesis was found at the end of the experiment evidenced by the dominant presence of Methanosarcina soligelidi and the low abundance of syntrophic  oxidising bacteria at the final period. Overall, for the first time, this study proved the positive effect of bioaugmentation on ammonia inhibition alleviation of the microalgae-dominating fed reactor, paving the way of efficient utilization of other protein-rich substrates in the future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicated that methane yield increased as well as active syntrophic relationships for interspecies hydrogen/formate (Anaerolinaceae-Methanobacterium beijingense) and  (Anaerolinaceae-Methanosaeta concilii) transfers at 8 g-COD l  day . However, methane yield was negatively affected at 16 g-COD l  day due to the competition for  by active Desulfovibrio marrakechensis and  inhibition.Microbial scenarios obtained by PCA correlations indicated that methane production from acid hydrolysates of ATAB was feasible at 8 g-COD l  day . The digester operation at higher OLR only favoured methanogenesis by the hydrogenotrophic pathway.Only cDNA analysis showed Archaea population dynamics, exhibiting high correlation with physicochemical variables towards the understanding of the methanogenic digester performance during OLR disturbances.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p></html>
