Currently, the major topical treatments have many side effects, making their continued use in patients difficult. Microalgae have emerged as a source of bio-active molecules such as glycolipids with potent anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to investigate the effects of a glycolipid () and a glycolipid fraction () obtained from the microalga  on a TPA-induced epidermal hyperplasia murine model. In a first set of experiments, we examined the preventive effects of  and  dissolved in acetone on TPA-induced hyperplasia model in mice. In a second step, we performed an in vivo permeability study by using rhodamine-containing cream, ointment, or gel to determinate the formulation that preserves the skin architecture and reaches deeper. The selected formulation was assayed to ensure the stability and enhanced permeation properties of the samples in an ex vivo experiment. Finally, -containing cream was assessed in the hyperplasia murine model. The results showed that pre-treatment with acetone-dissolved glycolipids reduced skin edema, epidermal thickness, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17) in epidermal tissue. The in vivo and ex vivo permeation studies showed that the cream formulation had the best permeability profile. In the same way, -cream formulation showed better permeation than acetone-dissolved preparation. -cream application attenuated TPA-induced skin edema, improved histopathological features, and showed a reduction of the inflammatory cell infiltrate. In addition, this formulation inhibited epidermal expression of COX-2 in a similar way to dexamethasone. Our results suggest that an -containing cream could be an emerging therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflammatory skin pathologies such as .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29315742>Depression- and anxiety-like behaviour is related to BDNF/TrkB signalling in a mouse model of .</a></h2><p>The prevalence of anxiety and depression is significantly higher in individuals with  than in the general population.

Anxiety-like behaviours in the elevated-plus maze test and changes in BDNF/TrkB that have been implicated in depression and anxiety behaviours were measured. Skin lesions induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13- (TPA) were also measured when the mice were administered fluoxetine and K252a, an antagonist of TrkB.The antidepression and anti-anxiety drug fluoxetine reduced TPA-induced skin lesions and increased expression of BDNF and TrkB in K5.Stat3C mice.

Transcriptomic analysis performed on ≈100 genes related to skin biological functions firstly revealed that the crude  extract was able to significantly negatively modulate specific genes involved in pro-inflammation (interleukin 1α encoding gene, IL1A) and pain detection related to tissue inflammation (nerve growth factor NGF and its receptor NGFR). An in vitro model of normal human keratinocytes was then used to evaluate the ability of the  extract to control the release of neuro-inflammation mediators under phorbol myristate  (PMA)-induced inflammatory conditions. The extract incorporated at 1% and 3% significantly inhibited the release of IL-1α and NGF secretion. These results were confirmed in a co-culture system of reconstructed human epithelium and normal human epidermal keratinocytes on which a cream formulated with the  extract at 1% and 3% was topically applied after systemic induction of neuro-inflammation. Finally, an in vitro model of normal human astrocytes was developed for the evaluation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor modulation, mimicking pain sensing related to neuro-inflammation as observed in sensitive skins. Treatment with the  extract at 1% and 3% significantly decreased PMA-mediated TRPV1 over-expression. In parallel with these biological experiments, the crude  extract was fractionated by centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) and chemically profiled by a recently developed C NMR-based dereplication method. The CPC-generated fractions as well as pure metabolites were tested again in vitro in an attempt to identify the biologically active constituents involved in the neuro-soothing activity of the  extract. Two active molecules, namely, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its structural derivative GABA-alanine, demonstrated a strong capacity to positively regulate skin sensitization mechanisms related to the TRPV1 receptors under PMA-induced inflammatory conditions, therefore providing interesting perspectives for the treatment of sensitive skins, atopia, dermatitis, or .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29272319>Rottlerin as a therapeutic approach in : Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies.</a></h2><p>Rottlerin is a natural polyphenolic compound that was initially indicated as a PKCδ inhibitor. However, it was recently revealed that it may target a number of molecules and have biological effects on various cell types and is considered as a possible agent for tumor and cell proliferative diseases.  is a chronic inflammatory cutaneous disorder with undefined etiology and is characterized by abnormal cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Therefore, this paper investigates the regulatory effects of rottlerin on normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasiform (IPI) lesions. In vitro results showed that rottlerin inhibited cell proliferation in NHEKs through growth arrest and NFκB inhibition. It may also induce apoptosis in an autophagy-dependent pathway. We found that rottlerin inhibited human microvascular endothelial cells tube formation on matrigel. Rottlerin also decreased the cell senescence of keratinocytes and intracellular ROS generation, which indicated its antioxidant effect. We also showed that rottlerin affects the expression of keratinocyte proliferation biomarkers. In 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol13- (TPA)-induced keratinocytes, rottlerin significantly inhibited the expression of the induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in keratinocytes. An animal experiment provided the corresponding evidence based on this evidence in vitro, by using IPI model, we found that rottlerin could relieve the psoriasiform of BALB/c mice by inhibiting keratinocyte proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and vascular proliferation. In conclusion, our results suggest that rottlerin may prove useful in the development of therapeutic agents against .

There is growing evidence that the IL-23/Th17 axis plays a critical role in development of the disease. It was recently shown that in addition to CD4 Th17 cells, various IL-17-producing cell subsets such as CD8 Tc17 cells, dermal γδ T cells, and innate lymphoid cells are also involved in the development of psoriatic inflammation in humans.To investigate which subsets of IL-17-producing cells are involved in -like skin inflammation in a TPA (tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-)-induced K14.Stat3C mouse model.Skin-infiltrating cells were isolated from inflamed lesions of TPA-treated K14.Stat3C transgenic mice, and analyzed for IL-17 producing cell subsets by flow cytometry.We observed significantly increased numbers of IL-17-producing CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and dermal γδ T cells in TPA-induced skin lesions of K14.Stat3C mice. Additionally, we found that another IL-17-producing T cell subset, αβ-TCR CD4CD8 double negative T cells (DN αβ T cells), was also increased in lesional skin. These IL-17-producing DN αβ T cells are NK1.1 negative, suggesting they are not natural killer T cells or mucosal associated invariant T cells. As well as other IL-17-producing cells, DN αβ T cells in the inflamed skin can also respond to IL-23 stimulation to produce IL-17. It is also suggested that DN αβ T cells may express retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t and CC chemokine receptor 6.In TPA-induced lesional skin of K14.Stat3C mice, IL-17-producing CD4 Th17 cells, CD8 Tc17 cells, dermal γδ T cells and TCR cells probably containing ILCs all participated in skin inflammation, which is similar to human clinical psoriatic features. Furthermore, we showed for the first time the possibility that an IL-17-producing DN αβ T cell subset is also involved in psoriatic inflammation.Copyright © 2016 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

Limits of detection and quantitation were recorded as 32.06 and 85.33 ng/spot and 74.055 and 243.72 ng/spot for quercetin and kaempferol, respectively.We concluded that this method employing HPTLC in the quantitative determination of quercetin and kaempferol is efficient, simple, accurate, and validated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26096886>Fumaric acid esters prevent the NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated and ATP-triggered pyroptosis of differentiated THP-1 cells.</a></h2><p>Fumaric acid esters (FAEs) exert therapeutic effects in patients with  and multiple sclerosis, however their mode of action remains elusive. Pyroptosis is a caspase-1-dependent pro-inflammatory form of programmed cell death, mediated by the activation of inflammasomes. To understand the pharmacological basis of the therapeutic effects of FAEs, the anti-pyroptotic activity of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and its hydrolysis metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF) was studied in a model of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis of human macrophages. Phorbol myristate -differentiated THP-1 cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (5 μg/ml; 4h), then pulsed with ATP (5mM; 1h). MMF, DMF, or parthenolide (positive control) were added 1h before the ATP pulse. The pyroptotic cell death was evaluated by morphological examination and quantified by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase leakage. The ATP-triggered death of THP-1 cells (60.4 ± 4.0%) was significantly (P<0.01) prevented by DMF, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (pIC50 and maximal effect were 6.6 and 67.6 ± 1.2%, respectively). MMF was less efficacious than DMF. These effects were accompanied by a decreased intracellular activation of caspase-1 and interleukin-1β release from ATP-treated cells, thus suggesting that FAEs antagonise the effects of ATP by preventing the activation of the pyroptotic molecular cascade leading to cell death. These results indicate that FAEs are endowed with anti-pyroptotic activity, which may contribute to their therapeutic effects.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, the medicinal properties of some species still need to be scientifically validated. The present study was designed to investigate into the biological properties of various solvent extracts (ethyl , methanol, and aqueous) of the roots and aerial parts of Scrophularia lucida based on its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and enzyme inhibitory activities together with phytochemical screening. Our results revealed that the solvent extracts differed in their biological effectiveness. The root ethyl  extract showed the highest ABTS scavenging, FRAP, CUPRAC, and inhibitory activity against AChE and α-glucosidase. The ethyl  extract of the aerial parts displayed the highest BChE and α-amylase inhibition and antioxidant effect in the phosphomolybdenum assay, while the methanol extracts of both parts were the most effective DPPH scavengers and tyrosinase inhibitors. The methanol extracts of the root and aerial parts also inhibited NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine leukemic monocyte-macrophage cell (4.99% and 10.77%, respectively), at 31.25 μg/mL concentration. The highest TPC (34.98 mg GAE/g extract) and TFC (48.33 mg RE/g extract) were observed in the ethyl  extract of the root and aerial parts, respectively. The most abundant compounds in the root ethyl  extract were luteolin (852 μg/g extract), rosmarinic acid (522 μg/g extract), and hesperidin (394 μg/g extract) while kaempferol was most abundant in the ethyl  extract of the aerial parts (628 μg/g extract). In silico experiments were conducted on tyrosinase and the higher docking values were observed for rosmarinic acid and hesperidin.

In this study, a daily rhythm of skin vitamin D receptor (VDR) and chronotherapeutic profiles of maxacalcitol, a vitamin D analogue, were evaluated using mice with skin inflammation induced by topical 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA).

Recent studies have found that PGRN has dual roles in inflammation and exerts anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory function in different diseases. However, the role of PGRN in  has not been fully elucidated. Here, we detected preferential expression of PGRN in human psoriatic lesions and serum. Moreover, serum PGRN/tumour necrosis factor-α ratio was negatively correlated with disease severity. To investigate the role of PGRN in the pathogenesis of , we used wild-type (WT) and PGRN(-/-) mice in a model of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA) -induced -like inflammation. We demonstrated that PGRN expression was dramatically enhanced in the -like lesions of TPA-treated WT mice, in accordance with human psoriatic lesions. Surprisingly, PGRN(-/-) mice were more sensitive to the development of TPA-induced -like inflammation. The mechanism underlying this increased sensitivity of PGRN(-/-) mice to TPA-induced -like inflammation was impaired differentiation of regulatory T cells in lymph nodes and decreased recruitment of these cells in the affected skin, which results in more severe inflammation. Hence, in WT mice, PGRN promotes differentiation and recruitment of regulatory T cells at the site of inflammation, which protects the skin from an exaggerated -like inflammatory response.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905492>A novel RORγt inhibitor is a potential therapeutic agent for the topical treatment of  with low risk of thymic aberrations.</a></h2><p>Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) has critical roles in the development, maintenance and function of interleukin (IL)-17-producing cells and is a highly attractive target for the treatment of IL-17-mediated autoimmune disease, particularly .

Reports on the clinical efficacy of GMA in patients with skin lesions have appeared in the published work. Dermatological diseases, which are known to respond to GMA, include pyoderma gangrenosum, skin lesions of Behçet's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, pustular , psoriatic arthritis, adult-onset Still's disease, Sweet's syndrome, cutaneous allergic vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus rashes. In association with clinical studies, efforts to understand the mechanisms of GMA have made significant progress. GMA selectively depletes elevated myeloid lineage leukocytes through binding between blood immunoglobulin G or complement iC3b, which form on the surface of CA beads and the Fcγ receptors or complement receptors expressed on the myeloid lineage cells. However, GMA has immunomodulatory effects including down-modulation of inflammatory cytokine profile, changes in leukocyte surface receptors and induction of regulatory T cells. These actions render GMA a unique non-pharmacological treatment option for patients with chronic dermatoid conditions, which are difficult to treat with pharmacological preparations.© 2018 Japanese Dermatological Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25268586>Psoriatic inflammation facilitates the onset of arthritis in a mouse model.</a></h2><p>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a seronegative, inflammatory joint disease associated with . In most patients with PsA, skin lesions precede arthritis; however, the causality of skin inflammation for the development of arthritis remains unclear.

Nitidine chloride also significantly downregulated bcl-2 and upregulated bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3. Mechanistic studies revealed that nitidine chloride-induced apoptosis involved the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. More importantly, in 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13- (TPA)- and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation models, nitidine chloride inhibited topical edema in mouse ear and back skin, substantially reducing tissue thickness and weight. In some cases, nitidine chloride also ameliorated conditions caused by TPA and IMQ, such as angiogenesis and infiltration of large numbers of inflammatory cells around blood vessels. Additionally, nitidine chloride inhibited the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines in the two animal models. In conclusion, our results are the first to demonstrate that nitidine chloride inhibits the proliferation of HaCaT cells, induces apoptosis partly via the JNK signaling pathway in vitro and ameliorates skin lesions and inflammation in vivo, making it an appropriate candidate for  treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Considering the side effects and drug resistance of the current therapy, it is urgent to discover more effective and safer anti-psoriatic drugs. In the present study, we screened over 250 traditional Chinese medicine compounds for their ability to inhibit the cell viability of cultured human HaCaT keratinocytes, a -relevant in vitro model, and found that periplogenin was highly effective. Mechanistic studies revealed that apoptosis and autophagy were not induced by periplogenin in HaCaT cells. However, periplogenin caused PI to permeate into cells, increased lactate LDH release and rapidly increased the number of necrotic cells. Additionally, the typical characteristics of necrosis were observed in the periplogenin-treated HaCaT cells. Notably, the necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1 and NSA were able to rescue the cells from necrotic cell death, supporting that necroptosis was involved in periplogenin-induced cell death. Furthermore, the ROS levels were elevated in the periplogenin-treated cells, NAC (an antioxidant) and Nec-1 could inhibit the ROS levels, and NAC could attenuate necroptotic cell death, indicating that the periplogenin-induced necroptotic cell death was mediated by oxidative stress. More importantly, in the murine models of TPA-induced epidermal hyperplasia and IMQ-induced skin inflammation, topical administration of periplogenin ameliorated skin lesions and inflammation. In sum, our results indicate, for the first time, that periplogenin is a naturally occurring compound with potent anti-psoriatic effects in vitro and in vivo, making it a promising candidate for future drug research.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Fumaderm , a fumaric acid ester (FAE) formulation consisting of different FAE salts, has been successfully used to treat  for decades. Most recently, FAE treatment was reported to inhibit NET formation in murine epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.To elucidate the effect of FAE treatment on human  and healthy donor NET formation.Among the compounds present in the FAE formulation, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) pretreatment of human  and healthy donor PMN resulted in a consistent inhibitory effect on NET formation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13- but not to platelet activating factor and ionomycin. This effect was l-glutathione (GSH) dependent and involved a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, a key event in NET formation. In contrast, G-protein-coupled signalling and protein synthesis were not involved. Monomethyl fumarate (MMF) was found to slightly reduce ROS production without affecting NET formation.We report DMF as a potent, stimulus-specific, GSH- and ROS-dependent modulator of NET formation. Our results support the notion that modulation of NET formation contributes to the beneficial effects of FAEs in a variety of inflammatory conditions.© 2017 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30348839>A Tumor-Promoting Phorbol Ester Causes a Large Increase in APOBEC3A Expression and a Moderate Increase in APOBEC3B Expression in a Normal Human Keratinocyte Cell Line without Increasing Genomic Uracils.</a></h2><p>Phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) promotes skin cancer in rodents. The mutations found in murine tumors are similar to those found in human skin cancers, and PMA promotes proliferation of human skin cells. PMA treatment of human keratinocytes increases the synthesis of APOBEC3A, an enzyme that converts cytosines in single-stranded DNA to uracil, and mutations in a variety of human cancers are attributed to APOBEC3A or APOBEC3B expression. We tested here the possibility that induction of APOBEC3A by PMA causes genomic accumulation of uracils that may lead to such mutations. When a human keratinocyte cell line was treated with PMA, both APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B gene expression increased, anti-APOBEC3A/APOBEC3B antibody bound a protein(s) in the nucleus, and nuclear extracts displayed cytosine deamination activity. Surprisingly, there was little increase in genomic uracils in PMA-treated wild-type or uracil repair-defective cells. In contrast, cells transfected with a plasmid expressing APOBEC3A acquired more genomic uracils. Unexpectedly, PMA treatment, but not APOBEC3A plasmid transfection, caused a cessation in cell growth. Hence, a reduction in single-stranded DNA at replication forks may explain the inability of PMA-induced APOBEC3A/APOBEC3B to increase genomic uracils. These results suggest that the proinflammatory PMA is unlikely to promote extensive APOBEC3A/APOBEC3B-mediated cytosine deaminations in human keratinocytes.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28359820>Development of medicated foams that combine incompatible hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs for  treatment.</a></h2><p>The focus was on the development of medicated foam for incorporation of two incompatible active agents for  treatment; i.e., lipophilic cholecalciferol, and hydrophilic salicylic acid. Emphasis was given to formulation of a propellant-free foam, with sufficient foaming properties, physical and chemical stability, and low irritancy potential to maintain relevance for later translation into clinical practice. Various excipients and concentrations were examined to achieve suitable foam stability parameters, viscoelasticity, and bubble-size, which relate to foamability and spreadability. The major positive impact on these properties was through a combination of surfactants, and by inclusion of a viscosity-modifying polymer. Incorporation of the incompatible drugs was then examined, noting the instability of cholecalciferol in an acidic environment, with the design aim to separate the drug distributions among the different foam phases. Cholecalciferol was stabilized in the emulsion-based foam, with at least a 30-fold lower degradation rate constant compared to its aqueous solution. The composition of the emulsion-based foam itself protected cholecalciferol from degradation, as well as the addition of the radical-scavenging antioxidant tocopheryl  to the oil phase. With the patient in mind, the irritancy potential was also examined, which was below the set limit that defines a non-irritant dermal product.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species in cell-free systems were measured using a multi-well fluorometer or a spectrophotometer. A -like skin inflammation was induced in mice using the IMQ cream.KLHTT suppressed superoxide anion generation, ROS production, CD11b expression, and adhesion in activated human neutrophils. In contrast, KLHTT failed to alter elastase release in activated human neutrophils. Additionally, KLHTT had an ROS-scavenging effect in the AAPH assay, but it did not scavenge superoxide anions directly in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay. Protein kinase C (PKC)-induced NET formation most commonly occurs through ROS-dependent mechanisms. KLHTT significantly inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-, a PKC activator, inducing NET formation. Furthermore, topical KLHTT treatment reduced the area affected by  area and severity index (PASI) score and ameliorated neutrophil infiltration in IMQ-induced -like skin inflammation in mice.Our data show that KLHTT has anti-neutrophilic inflammatory effects in inhibiting ROS generation and cell adhesion. KLHTT also mitigated NET formation, mainly via an ROS-dependent pathway. In addition, KLHTT reduced neutrophil infiltration and improved the severity of IMQ-induced -like skin inflammation in mice. Therefore, KLHTT may prove to be a safe and effective  therapy in the future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Retinoids have multiple actions and play important roles in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, vision, bone growth, tumor suppression and immunity. The effects of retinoids are thought to be mediated by their binding to and activation of the retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors which regulate gene expression, important in normal growth and differentiation. Vitamin A in doses that have medical effects was found to be toxic, particularly when given long term. Modification of the vitamin A structure led to retinoid molecules that had many of its beneficial, but fewer of its adverse effects. Oral retinoids in use in the United States include acitretin for  and isotretinoin for severe nodular acne. Tretinoin is used topically and several other retinoids have been developed for therapy of uncommon forms of cancer (alitretinoin, bexarotene). The commonly used retinoids have many of the side effects of vitamin A including dry skin, cheilosis and nosebleeds and hair loss, but are not stored in the liver and do not cause the typical form of chronic liver disease associated with excessive vitamin A intake. Both acitretin and isotretinoin are teratogenic and embryotoxic and are contraindicated in women who are or intend to become pregnant. Retinoids have been implicated in causing mild-to-moderate elevations in routine liver tests, but these elevations are usually asymptomatic and transient, resolving spontaneously even with continued therapy. Marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during retinoid therapy are uncommon, and dose adjustment or drug discontinuation are rarely required for liver test abnormalities. Nevertheless, laboratory monitoring is recommended with routine liver tests at baseline and one month later, and testing thereafter only if abnormalities were found or symptoms arise. Several retinoids (acitretin, etretinate, retinal ) have been associated with a clinically apparent acute liver injury which typically arises during the first 3 months of therapy, has many features of hypersensitivity and can be severe and even fatal. Interestingly, isotretinoin often causes mild serum aminotransferase elevations and is commonly listed as having frequent adverse effects on the liver, but it has not been convincingly linked to instances of severe clinically apparent, acute liver injury with jaundice. Two retinoids used in dermatology, acitretin and isotretinoin, are discussed in this record and their combined references of retinoids are provided at the end of this introductory section.

We also searched five trials registers and handsearched the conference proceedings of eight dermatology meetings. We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant trials.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of all interventions for hidradenitis suppurativa.Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality and performed data extraction. Our primary outcomes were quality of life, measured by a validated dermatology-specific scale, and adverse effects of the interventions.Twelve trials, with 615 participants, met our inclusion criteria. The median number of participants in each trial was 27, and median trial duration was 16 weeks. The included studies were conducted over a 32-year time period, from 1983 to 2015. A single RCT that was underpowered to detect clinically meaningful differences investigated most interventions.There were four trials of anti-TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor-alpha) therapies, which included etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab. Adalimumab 40 mg weekly improved the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score in participants with moderate to severe HS by 4.0 points relative to placebo (95% confidence interval (CI) -6.5 to -1.5 points), an effect size approximately equal to the DLQI minimal clinically important difference. We reduced the evidence quality to 'moderate' because the effect size was based on the results of only one study. In a meta-analysis of two studies with 124 participants, standard dose adalimumab 40 mg every other week was ineffective compared with placebo (moderate quality evidence). In a smaller study of 38 participants, of whom only 33 provided efficacy data, infliximab 5 mg/kg treatment improved DLQI by 8.4 DLQI points after eight weeks. Etanercept 50 mg twice weekly was well tolerated but ineffective.In a RCT of 200 participants, no difference was found in surgical complications (week one: risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.05, moderate quality evidence) or risk of recurrence (after three months: RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.34, moderate quality evidence) in those randomised to receive a gentamicin-collagen sponge prior to primary closure compared with primary closure alone.RCTs of other interventions, including topical clindamycin 1% solution; oral tetracycline; oral ethinylestradiol 50 mcg with either cyproterone  50 mg or norgestrel 500 mcg; intense pulsed light; neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser; methylene blue gel photodynamic therapy; and staphage lysate, were relatively small studies, preventing firm conclusions due to imprecision.Many knowledge gaps exist in RCT evidence for HS. Moderate quality evidence exists for adalimumab, which improves DLQI score when 40 mg is given weekly, twice the standard  dose. However, the 95% confidence interval includes an effect size of only 1.5 DLQI points, which may not be clinically relevant, and the safety profile of weekly dosing has not been fully established. Infliximab also improves quality of life, based on moderate quality evidence.More RCTs are needed in most areas of HS care, particularly oral treatments and the type and timing of surgical procedures. Outcomes should be validated, ideally, including a minimal clinically important difference for HS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30544700>Three Constituents of  Seeds Regulate Expression of Th17-Relevant Cytokines and Ameliorate TPA-Induced -Like Skin Lesions in Mice.</a></h2><p>As a folk medicine,  L. is used effectively to treat inflammatory conditions and skin diseases.

It was suggested that the interleukin-23 (IL-23)/IL-17A cytokine axis played a critical role in the pathogenesis of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 12-myristate 13- (TPA)-induced K14-VEGF transgenic -like mice model. Here, we report that topical use of a curcumin gel formulation inhibited TPA-induced Th1 inflammation in K14-VEGF transgenic mice ears but not Th17 inflammation as expected. Real-time PCR showed that mRNA levels of IL-23, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-6 and TNFα cytokines failed to increase after TPA-induction in K14-VEGF transgenic mice ear skin; but the mRNA level of IFNγ increased significantly at the same time. Furthermore, TPA-induction up-regulated the TCRγδ protein but failed to impact the CCR6 protein, which means that the proliferation of γδ T cells is incapable of IL-17A production. We find that curcumin is capable of relieving TPA-induced inflammation by directly down-regulating IFNγ production. In conclusion, curcumin inhibits TPA-induced Th1 inflammation in K14-VEGF transgenic mice which has not been previously described.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Psoriatic lesions are characterized by hyperproliferation, aberrant differentiation, and inflammation, with the psoriatic cytokine network maintained by communication between immune cells and keratinocytes. Recently, there is increasing evidence regarding the pivotal role of keratinocytes in mediating the disease process, and these cells can be regarded as safe therapeutic targets. From the data available on human subjects treated with Fumaderm, MMF is an effective antipsoriatic agent with known effects on immune cells. However, little is known about its direct effects on keratinocytes. We hypothesized that MMF has direct antiproliferative, prodifferentiative, and anti-inflammatory effects on keratinocytes. Indeed, MMF dose-dependently inhibited [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, indicating a direct antiproliferative action on keratinocytes. MMF significantly increased the protein level of keratin 10, the early keratinocyte differentiation marker, and the activity of transglutaminase, a late differentiation marker. These results are consistent with an ability of MMF to promote keratinocyte differentiation and inhibit proliferation, thereby improving psoriatic lesions. In 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA)-induced keratinocytes, MMF significantly inhibited the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-6, and interleukin-1α as well as the production of TNFα.

Previously, we reported that the EtOAc fraction of J. communis (EAJC) contained tyrosinase inhibition properties in vitro non-cellular experiment. The aim of this study was to evaluate anti-melanogenic effect of standardized EAJC on a hyperpigmentation animal model. Therapeutic effects of EAJC toward skin hyperpigmentation were confirmed by both in vivo experiment and in vitro cell-based assay. Skin depigmenting effect was detected by topical treatment of EAJC for 11 d to HRM-2 melanin-possessing hairless mice. Histologic findings including significantly decreased melanin depositions could be observed in dorsal skin samples of EAJC-treated group. In addition, the EAJC (50 µg/mL) attenuated melanin production through down-regulation of tyrosinase activity and protein expression in B16 murine melanoma cells. According to the phytochemical analysis, EAJC was found to contain hypolaetin-7-O-β-D-xylopyranoside and isoscutellarein-7-O-β-D-xylopyranoside as main components. Hypolaetin-7-O-β-D-xylopyranoside was responsible for the skin-lightening effect of EAJC by reducing the number of melanocytes in dorsal skins of HRM-2 mice.

Th17 cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritides (SpA). Here, we compared the expression of CD146 on CD4(+) T cells between healthy donors (HD) and patients with RA and SpA [ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA)] and examined correlations with surface markers and cytokine secretion. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from patients and controls, and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) from patients. Cytokine production [elicited by phorbol myristate  (PMA)/ionomycin] and surface phenotypes were evaluated by flow cytometry. CD146(+) CD4(+) and interleukin (IL)-17(+) CD4(+) T cell frequencies were increased in PBMC of PsA patients, compared with HD, and in SFMC compared with PBMC. CD146(+) CD4(+) T cells were enriched for secretion of IL-17 [alone or with IL-22 or interferon (IFN)-γ] and for some putative Th17-associated surface markers (CD161 and CCR6), but not others (CD26 and IL-23 receptor). CD4(+) T cells producing IL-22 or IFN-γ without IL-17 were also present in the CD146(+) subset, although their enrichment was less marked. Moreover, a majority of cells secreting these cytokines lacked CD146. Thus, CD146 is not a sensitive or specific marker of Th17 cells, but rather correlates with heterogeneous cytokine secretion by subsets of CD4(+) helper T cells.© 2014 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27307108>Interindividual variation of NETosis in healthy donors: introduction and application of a refined method for extracellular trap quantification.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is a mechanism of innate immune defence by which neutrophil (polymorphonuclear) granulocytes (PMN) produce net-like structures of decondensed chromatin decorated with antimicrobial peptides for trapping and possibly killing microorganisms. If this process leads to cell death, it is termed NETosis. Alterations of this particular mechanism have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases including  and lupus erythematosus. Still, quantification of NETosis poses a considerable challenge. We report and test a refined protocol for morphological NET quantification in healthy human donors that encompasses isolation, stimulation, DNA staining, live imaging and semi-automated offline analysis. The results were highly reproducible and in good agreement with manual counting. The average intra-donor coefficient of variation of NETosis rates to phorbol myristate  (PMA) stimulation was low compared to the respective interdonor coefficient of variation (10% vs 82%, n=4, respectively, if experiments were repeated on the same day, and 38% vs 74%, n=6, respectively, if experiments were repeated on average 42±34 days apart). Overall, the interdonor coefficient of variation was 67% (n=10). These findings altogether support the existence of a distinct predisposition of PMN from different donors for undergoing NETosis. Picogreen fluorescence correlated stronger to cell death than to morphological NETosis (r =.89, P<.001, n=8, and r =.68, P=.012, n=8, respectively). This indicates that cytotoxicity may confound Picogreen fluorescence.

Additionally, the lead compounds significantly improved imiquimod-induced -like inflammation in mice. Moreover, the expression levels of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-22, IL-23, nuclear factor-κB subunit p65, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ, were dramatically inhibited in the dorsal skin of 5i- and 5l-treated mice.

Here, we characterize benzoxaborole phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 inhibitors, a new topical class that has demonstrated therapeutic benefit for  and atopic dermatitis in phase 2 or phase 3 studies. Crisaborole [AN2728, 4-((1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-5-yl)oxy)benzonitrile], compd2 [2-ethoxy-6-((1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-5-yl)oxy)nicotinonitrile], compd3 [6-((1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-5-yl)oxy)-2-(2-isopropoxyethoxy)nicotinonitrile], and compd4 [5-chloro-6-((1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-5-yl)oxy)-2-((4-oxopentyl)oxy)nicotinonitrile] are potent PDE4 inhibitors with similar affinity for PDE4 isoforms and equivalent inhibition on the catalytic domain and the full-length enzyme. These benzoxaboroles are less active on other PDE isozymes. Compd4 binds to the catalytic domain of PDE4B2 with the oxaborole group chelating the catalytic bimetal and overlapping with the phosphate in cAMP during substrate hydrolysis, and the interaction extends into the adenine pocket. In cell culture, benzoxaborole PDE4 inhibitors suppress the release of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-23, IL-17, interferon-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-22, and these cytokines contribute to the pathologic changes in skin structure and barrier functions as well as immune dysregulation in atopic dermatitis and . Treatment with compd3 or N(6),2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate increases cAMP response element binding protein phosphorylation in human monocytes and decreases extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in human T cells; these changes lead to reduced cytokine production and are among the mechanisms by which compd3 blocks cytokine release. Topical compd3 penetrates the skin and suppresses phorbol myristate -induced IL-13, IL-22, IL-17F, and IL-23 transcription and calcipotriol-induced thymic stromal lymphopoietin expression in mouse skin. Skin thinning is a major dose-limiting side effect of glucocorticoids. By contrast, repeated application of compd3 did not thin mouse skin. These findings show the potential benefits and safety of benzoxaborole PDE4 inhibitors for the treatment of  and atopic dermatitis.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28186503>A novel DLX3-PKC integrated signaling network drives keratinocyte differentiation.</a></h2><p>Epidermal homeostasis relies on a well-defined transcriptional control of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, which is critical to prevent skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis,  or cancer. We have recently shown that the homeobox transcription factor DLX3 and the tumor suppressor p53 co-regulate cell cycle-related signaling and that this mechanism is functionally involved in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma development. Here we show that DLX3 expression and its downstream signaling depend on protein kinase C α (PKCα) activity in skin. We found that following 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13- (TPA) topical treatment, DLX3 expression is significantly upregulated in the epidermis and keratinocytes from mice overexpressing PKCα by transgenic targeting (K5-PKCα), resulting in cell cycle block and terminal differentiation. Epidermis lacking DLX3 (DLX3cKO), which is linked to the development of a DLX3-dependent epidermal hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis and dermal leukocyte recruitment, displays enhanced PKCα activation, suggesting a feedback regulation of DLX3 and PKCα. Of particular significance, transcriptional activation of epidermal barrier, antimicrobial peptide and cytokine genes is significantly increased in DLX3cKO skin and further increased by TPA-dependent PKC activation. Furthermore, when inhibiting PKC activity, we show that epidermal thickness, keratinocyte proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration are reduced and the PKC-DLX3-dependent gene expression signature is normalized. Independently of PKC, DLX3 expression specifically modulates regulatory networks such as Wnt signaling, phosphatase activity and cell adhesion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis of primary suprabasal keratinocytes showed binding of DLX3 to the proximal promoter regions of genes associated with cell cycle regulation, and of structural proteins and transcription factors involved in epidermal differentiation. These results indicate that Dlx3 potentially regulates a set of crucial genes necessary during the epidermal differentiation process. Altogether, we demonstrate the existence of a robust DLX3-PKCα signaling pathway in keratinocytes that is crucial to epidermal differentiation control and cutaneous homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212864>GPR43 activation enhances -like inflammation through epidermal upregulation of IL-6 and dual oxidase 2 signaling in a murine model.</a></h2><p>The gut is densely inhabited by commensal bacteria, which metabolize dietary fibers/undigested carbohydrates and produce short-chain fatty acids such as . GPR43 is one of the receptors to sense short-chain fatty acids, and expressed in various immune and non-immune cells. /GPR43 signaling has been shown to affect various inflammatory diseases through Th17 responses and NADPH oxidase (NOX)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. However, no study has previously explored the effects of GPR43 activation during -like inflammation. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of /phenylacetamide (GPR43 agonists) on imiquimod induced skin inflammation in mice. Mice were administered phenylacetamide/ followed by assessment of skin inflammation, NOXs (NOX-2, NOX-4, dual oxidases), and Th17 related signaling. Our study showed induction of epidermal GPR43 after imiquimod treatment, i.e. -like inflammation.  administration in psoriatic mice led to further increase in skin inflammation (ear thickness/myeloperoxidase activity) with concurrent increase in Th17 immune responses and epidermal dual oxidase-2 signaling. Further, topical application of GPR43 agonist, phenylacetamide led to enhanced ear thickness with concomitant epidermal IL-6 signaling as well as dual oxidase-2 upregulation which may be responsible for increased -like inflammation. Taken together, dual oxidase-2 and IL-6 play important roles in GPR43-mediated skin inflammation. The current study suggests that GPR43 activation in psoriatic patients may lead to aggravation of psoriatic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this context, earlier studies showed that Malva sylvestris L. has anti-inflammatory activity demonstrated by acute animal models of skin inflammation, becoming a promising target for further studies. The present investigation aimed to verify the effect of hydroalcoholic extract of M. sylvestris (HEMS) on the chronic inflammatory and hyperproliferative response caused by multiple applications of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) on mouse ears. Topical application of HEMS reduced oedema, leukocyte migration (mono- and polymorphonuclear cells) and keratinocyte hyperproliferation, confirmed by histology and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining. It was found that the anti-inflammatory effects of the extract did not involve the glucocorticoid system, and its incubation with HaCaT keratinocytes caused low toxicity and reduced cell proliferation by apoptosis. Thus, HEMS proved to be effective as an anti-psoriatic therapy, with the ability to prevent keratinocyte hyperproliferation and with low toxicity by topical application.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Because the available treatments for  have significant limitations, dietary products are potential natural sources of therapeutic molecules, which can repair the molecular defects associated with  and could possibly be developed for its management. Fisetin (3,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone), a phytochemical naturally found in pigmented fruits and vegetables, has demonstrated proapoptotic and antioxidant effects in several malignancies. This study utilized biochemical, cellular, pharmacological, and tissue engineering tools to characterize the effects of fisetin on normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and CD4+ T lymphocytes in 2D and 3D -like disease models. Fisetin treatment of NHEKs dose- and time-dependently induced differentiation and inhibited interleukin-22-induced proliferation, as well as activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Fisetin treatment of TNF-α stimulated NHEKs also significantly inhibited the activation of p38 and JNK, but had enhanced effect on ERK1/2 (MAPK). In addition, fisetin treatment significantly decreased the secretion of Th1/Th-17 pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN-γ and IL-17A by 12--tetradecanolylphorbol 13- (TPA)-stimulated NHEKs and anti-CD3/CD28-activated human PBMCs. Furthermore, we established the in vivo relevance of fisetin functions, using a 3D full-thickness human skin model of  (FTRHSP) that closely mimics in vivo human psoriatic skin lesions. Herein, fisetin significantly ameliorated -like disease features, and decreased the production of IL-17 by CD4+ T lymphocytes co-cultured with FTRHSP. Collectively, our data identify the prodifferentiative, antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory effects of fisetin, via modulation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and p38/JNK pathways and the production of cytokines in 2D and 3D human skin models of . These results suggest that fisetin has a great potential to be developed as an effective and inexpensive agent for the treatment of  and other related inflammatory skin disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28455829>A Novel Apremilast Nail Lacquer Formulation for the Treatment of Nail .</a></h2><p>The objective was to prepare a novel nail lacquer formulation to improve the ungual and trans-ungual delivery of apremilast for the potential treatment of nail . Nail lacquer formulation was prepared using Eudragit® S 100 as a film-forming polymer and the mixture of ethanol, ethyl , and water as a solvent system. As a result of high-throughput screening studies, dexpanthenol and salicylic acid were found to be the potential penetration enhancers. After 7 days of in vitro studies, the cumulative amount of apremilast delivered by the nail lacquer formulation across the nail plate was found to be ~3-fold (0.52 ± 0.07 μg/cm) more compared to control (nail lacquer formulation without enhancers) (0.19 ± 0.02 μg/cm). The cumulative amount of apremilast retained in the nail plate in the case of nail lacquer formulation was 1.26 ± 0.18 μg/mg which was found to be ~2-fold more compared to control (0.57 ± 0.07 μg/mg). Human subject studies were performed on the nails of thumb and index finger of six volunteers for 15 days. As a result, the cumulative amount of apremilast retained in the free distal edge of the nail plate in the case of nail lacquer was found to be ~2-fold (0.93 ± 0.14 μg/mg) more related to control (0.41 ± 0.04 μg/mg).

TNF-α is processed from a membrane-bound form by TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) to soluble form, which exerts a number of biological activities. EGF receptor (EGFR) ligands, including heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), amphiregulin and transforming growth factor (TGF)-α are also TACE substrates and are -associated growth factors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), one of the downstream molecules of EGFR and TNF signaling, plays a key role in angiogenesis for developing . In the present study, to assess the possible role of TACE in the pathogenesis of , we investigated the involvement of TACE in TPA-induced -like lesions in K5.Stat3C mice, which represent a mouse model of . In this mouse model, TNF-α, amphiregulin, HB-EGF and TGF-α were significantly up-regulated in the skin lesions, similar to human . Treatment of K5.Stat3C mice with TNF-α or EGFR inhibitors attenuated the skin lesions, suggesting the roles of TACE substrates in . Furthermore, the skin lesions of K5.Stat3C mice showed down-regulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3, an endogenous inhibitor of TACE, and an increase in soluble TNF-α. A TACE inhibitor abrogated EGFR ligand-dependent keratinocyte proliferation and VEGF production in vitro, suggesting that TACE was involved in both epidermal hyperplasia and angiogenesis during  development. These results strongly suggest that TACE contributes to the development of psoriatic lesions through releasing two kinds of  mediators, TNF-α and EGFR ligands.

It is involved in more than 300 enzyme systems and is an indispensable participant in many biochemical processes. Zinc deficiency causes a number of disorders in the human body, the main ones being the delay of growth and puberty, immune disorders, and cognitive dysfunctions. There are over two billion people in the world suffering from zinc deficiency conditions. Acyzol, a zinc-containing medicine, developed as an antidote against carbon monoxide poisoning, demonstrates a wide range of pharmacological activities: Anti-inflammatory, reparative, detoxifying, immunomodulatory, bacteriostatic, hepatoprotective, adaptogenic, antioxidant, antihypoxic, and cardioprotective. The presence of zinc in the composition of Acyzol suggests the potential of the drug in the treatment and prevention of zinc deficiency conditions, such as Prasad's disease, immune system pathology, alopecia, allergodermatoses, prostate dysfunction, , stomatitis, periodontitis, and delayed mental and physical development in children. Currently, the efficiency of Acyzol in the cases of zinc deficiency is shown in a large number of experimental studies.

In particular, soy PG, a PG mixture with a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, is efficacious at inhibiting these proliferating keratinocytes.  is a skin disorder characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and inflammation. Data in the lung suggest that PG in pulmonary surfactant inhibits inflammation. To investigate the possibility of using PG containing polyunsaturated fatty acids for the treatment of , we examined the effect of soy PG on inflammation induced by the application of 12--tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA), a contact irritant, to mouse ears in vivo. We monitored ear thickness and weight as a measure of ear edema, as well as CD45-positive immune cell infiltration. Our results indicate that soy PG when applied together with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D), an agent known to acutely disrupt the skin barrier, suppressed ear edema and inhibited the infiltration of CD45-positive immune cells. On the other hand, neither PG nor vitamin D alone was effective. The combination also decreased tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) levels. This result suggested the possibility that PG was not permeating the skin barrier efficiently. Therefore, in a further study we applied PG in a penetration-enhancing vehicle and found that it inhibited inflammation induced by the phorbol ester and decreased CD45-positive immune cell infiltration.

Despite the broad-spectrum therapeutic use of GC, the biochemical rationale for locally treating inflammatory skin conditions is poorly understood, as systemic GC production remains largely functional in these patients. GC synthesis has been well characterized in healthy skin, but the pathological consequence has not been examined. Here we show de novo GC synthesis, and GC receptor expression is dysfunctional in both nonlesional and lesional psoriatic skin. Use of GC receptor epidermal knockout mice with adrenalectomy allowed for the distinction between local (keratinocyte) and systemic GC activity. Compensation exhibited by adult GC receptor epidermal knockout mice demonstrated that keratinocyte-derived GC synthesis protected skin from topical phorbol 12-myristate 13--induced inflammatory assault. Thus, localized de novo GC synthesis in skin is essential for controlling inflammation, and loss of the GC pathway in psoriatic skin represents an additional pathological process in this complex inflammatory skin disease.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Lack of appropriate animal models has hampered generation of new knowledge in this area of research and we therefore sought to develop an animal model with combined atherosclerosis and -like skin inflammation.Topical 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) was applied to the ears twice per week for 8 weeks in atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice.TPA led to localized skin inflammation with increased epidermal thickness, infiltration of inflammatory-like cells and augmented tissue interleukin-17F levels.

Recent data indicate that peripheral immune stimulation can significantly affect the CNS. But the mechanisms underpinning this relationship remain unclear. The standard approach to understanding this relationship has relied on systemic immune activation using bacterial components, finding that immune mediators, such as cytokines, can have a significant effect on brain function and behaviour. More rarely have studies used disease models that are representative of human disorders.Here we use a well-characterised animal model of -like skin inflammation-imiquimod-to investigate the effects of tissue-specific peripheral inflammation on the brain. We used full genome array, flow cytometry analysis of immune cell infiltration, doublecortin staining for neural precursor cells and a behavioural read-out exploiting natural burrowing behaviour.We found that a number of genes are upregulated in the brain following treatment, amongst which is a subset of inflammatory chemokines (CCL3, CCL5, CCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, CXCL16 and CCR5). Strikingly, this model induced the infiltration of a number of immune cell subsets into the brain parenchyma, including T cells, NK cells and myeloid cells, along with a reduction in neurogenesis and a suppression of burrowing activity.These findings demonstrate that cutaneous, peripheral immune stimulation is associated with significant leukocyte infiltration into the brain and suggest that chemokines may be amongst the key mediators driving this response.</p></html>
