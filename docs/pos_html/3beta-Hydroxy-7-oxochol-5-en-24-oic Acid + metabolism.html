We used a metabolomic approach to identify urine  markers before cardiac surgery, aiming to define the physiology of patients with complex CHD and to contribute to predict their neurodevelopmental outcome.In a prospective, observational, single-center study we enrolled 28 patients with complex biventricular and univentricular CHD aged less than 5 years, on stable hemodynamic conditions, and with no genetic anomalies. We analyzed urine samples, collected at the induction of anesthesia, by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Profiles of 1H NMR spectra were submitted to unsupervised (principal component) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant) multivariate analysis. Neurodevelopment was assessed by neuropsychological and adaptive functioning testing.Principal components analysis divided CHD patients  profiles in two distinct clusters (RED and BLACK).  profiles belonging to the RED cluster showed higher levels of accumulation of citric  cycle intermediates and glucose compared to the profiles in the BLACK cluster, indicating a possible switching to anaerobic . Patients belonging to the RED cluster were significantly more prone to show an adverse neurodevelopment pattern (p = 0.01).The application of metabolomic analysis to CHD children permitted a deeper insight on their  status that could help to obtain a better understanding of the physiological implications and to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcome.© 2019 The Authors.

A sensitive and rapid method has been developed and validated as per regulatory guideline for the simultaneous quantitation of enasidenib and its active metabolite, AGI-16903 in mice plasma using an LC-MS/MS. Enasidenib and AGI-16903 along with internal standard were extracted from mice plasma using simple protein precipitation method. Chromatographic resolution of enasidenib, AGI-16903 and the internal standard (close analogue of AGI-16903) was achieved on a Chromolith RP-18e column using 0.2% formic :acetonitrile (15:85, v/v) as an eluent, which was delivered at a flow-rate of 1.2 mL/min. The MS/MS ion transitions monitored were m/z 474.1→267.2, 402.1→188.1 and 421.0→146.1 for enasidenib, AGI-16903 and the internal standard, respectively. The linearity range was 1.01-3023 ng/mL for both enasidenib and AGI-16903. The within-run and between-run accuracy and within-run and between-run precision were in the range of - 2.29 to 2.72 (as one value is in negative side). and 4.65-9.82%, respectively for enasidenib; 0.19-10.3 and 3.22-9.22%, respectively for AGI-16903. Both enasidenib and AGI-16903 were found to be stable in stability (up to three freeze-thaw cycles and for long-term at -80°C for 30 days) and processed (bench-top for 6 h and in in-injector for 24 h) samples. Application of the validated method was shown in a pharmacokinetic study in mice.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661916>Comparative Physiological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Mechanisms of Improved Osmotic Stress Tolerance in Annual Ryegrass by Exogenous Chitosan.</a></h2><p>Water deficit adversely affects the growth and productivity of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). The exogenous application of chitosan (CTS) has gained extensive interests due to its effect on improving drought resistance. This research aimed to determine the role of exogenous CTS on annual ryegrass in response to water stress. Here, we investigated the impact of exogenous CTS on the physiological responses and transcriptome changes of annual ryegrass variety "Tetragold" under osmotic stress induced by exposing them to 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG)-6000. Our experimental results demonstrated that 50 mg/L exogenous CTS had the optimal effect on promoting seed germination under osmotic stress. Pre-treatment of annual ryegrass seedlings with 500 mg/L CTS solution reduced the level of electrolyte leakage (EL) as well as the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbic  peroxidase (APX) under osmotic stress. In addition, CTS increased soluble sugars and chlorophyll (Chl) content, net photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), water use efficiency (WUE), and transpiration rate (E) in annual ryegrass seedlings in response to three and six days of osmotic stress. Transcriptome analysis further provided a comprehensive understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms of CTS impact. To be more specific, in contrast of non-treated seedlings, the distinct changes of gene expressions of CTS-treated seedlings were shown to be tightly related to carbon , photosynthesis, and plant hormone. Altogether, exogenous CTS could elicit drought-related genes in annual ryegrass, leading to resistance to osmotic stress via producing antioxidant enzymes and maintaining intact cell membranes and photosynthetic rates. This robust evidence supports the potential of the application of exogenous CTS, which will be helpful for determining the suitability and productivity of agricultural crops.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655133>β-Klotho gene variation is associated with liver damage in children with NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in adults and children. Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile   and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty  caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the liver-gut axis and especially the role of bile  in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease inflammation and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile   and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials. With the complexity of the issue, we did not aim at giving a complete review, rather highlighting important targets and potential treatments that could be approved for NAFLD/NASH treatment within the next few years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661889>Combined Exposure to Fructose and Bisphenol A Exacerbates Abnormal Lipid  in Liver of Developmental Male Rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal lipid  in the liver of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid  include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty  synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid  in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666664>LC-MS based metabolomic profiling for renal cell carcinoma histologic subtypes.</a></h2><p>Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are classified according to their histological features. Accurate classification of RCC and comprehensive understanding of their  dysregulation are of critical importance. Here we investigate the use of metabolomic analyses to classify the main RCC subtypes and to describe the  variation for each subtype. To this end, we performed metabolomic profiling of 65 RCC frozen samples (40 clear cell, 14 papillary and 11 chromophobe) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. OPLS-DA multivariate analysis based on metabolomic data showed clear discrimination of all three main subtypes of RCC (R = 75.0%, Q = 59.7%). The prognostic performance was evaluated using an independent cohort and showed an AUROC of 0.924, 0.991 and 1 for clear cell, papillary and chromophobe RCC, respectively. Further pathway analysis using the 21 top metabolites showed significant differences in amino  and fatty   between three RCC subtypes. In conclusion, this study shows that metabolomic profiling could serve as a tool that is complementary to histology for RCC subtype classification. An overview of  dysregulation in RCC subtypes was established giving new insights into the understanding of their clinical behaviour and for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655278>1-Methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline - The toxicological research on an exo/endogenous amine with antidepressant-like activity - In vivo, in vitro and in silico studies.</a></h2><p>1-Methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1MeTIQ) demonstrates significant neuroprotective activity. It can interact with agonistic conformation of dopamine (DA) receptors. 1MeTIQ inhibits the formation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic  as well as production of free radicals and shifts DA catabolism toward COMT-dependent O-methylation. 1MeTIQ inhibits both MAO-A and B enzymes activity and increases neurotransmitters levels in the brain. It shows significant antidepressant-like effect in forced swim test (FST) in rats. This compound might be effective for depression therapy in a clinical setting but its success is determined not only by good efficacy, but also by an acceptable its ADMET profile. The use of combination in silico prediction with in vivoand in vitro studies greatly simplifies the search for new, safer and effectively acting drugs.The aim of this study was to investigate the degree of histopathological changes in different rats tissues after acute and chronic administration of 1MeTIQ. Additionally, prediction of its properties in terms of absorption, distribution, , elimination and toxicity in the human body was performed.The obtained data did not show extensive and significant toxic effects of tested substance in in vivoand in vitrostudies in rats, and in silico ADMET prediction.These results can help to discover a new effective and safe antidepressant substance and have important significance in the treatment of depression in clinic. Additionally, the use in the treatment of depression substance with neuroprotective, antioxidant and antidepressant-like effects in the CNS and existing endogenously might be also beneficial in controlling the adverse CNS inflammatory processes accompanying depression.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

It secretes unusually shaped nanotubular outer membrane vesicles (OMV) loaded with a number of virulence factors and immunoreactive proteins. In the present study, the vesicles were purified from a clinical isolate of subsp.  strain FSC200. We here provide a comprehensive proteomic characterization of OMV using a novel approach in which a comparison of OMV and membrane fraction is performed in order to find proteins selectively enriched in OMV vs. membrane. Only these proteins were further considered to be really involved in the OMV function and/or their exceptional structure. OMV were also isolated from bacteria cultured under various cultivation conditions simulating the diverse environments of  life cycle. These included conditions mimicking the milieu inside the mammalian host during inflammation: oxidative stress, low pH, and high temperature (42°C); and in contrast, low temperature (25°C). We observed several-fold increase in vesiculation rate and significant protein cargo changes for high temperature and low pH. Further proteomic characterization of stress-derived OMV gave us an insight how the bacterium responds to the hostile environment of a mammalian host through the release of differentially loaded OMV. Among the proteins preferentially and selectively packed into OMV during stressful cultivations, the previously described virulence factors connected to the unique intracellular trafficking of  were detected.

Imaging inflammation provides information on disease prognosis and may guide therapy, but the cellular basis of the signal remains equivocal. We evaluated leukocyte subtype specificity of characterized clinically relevant inflammation-targeted radiotracers.Leukocyte populations were purified from blood- and THP-1-derived macrophages were polarized into M1-, reparative M2a-, or M2c-macrophages. In vitro uptake assays were conducted using tracers of enhanced glucose or amino   and molecular markers of inflammatory cells. Both F-deoxyglucose (F-FDG) and the labeled amino  C-methionine (C-MET) displayed higher uptake in neutrophils and monocytes compared to other leukocytes (P = 0.005), and markedly higher accumulation in pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages compared to reparative M2a-macrophages (P < 0.001). Molecular tracers Ga-DOTATATE targeting the somatostatin receptor type 2 and Ga-pentixafor targeting the chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) exhibited broad uptake by leukocyte subpopulations and polarized macrophages with highest uptake in T-cells/natural killer cells and B-cells compared to neutrophils. Mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO)-targeted F-flutriciclamide selectively accumulated in monocytes and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (P < 0.001). Uptake by myocytes and fibroblasts tended to be higher for  radiotracers.The different in vitro cellular uptake profiles may allow isolation of distinct phases of the inflammatory pathway with specific inflammation-targeted radiotracers.

Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty  concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS.

SIRT1 is a  sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy , oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy  involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty  utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy  is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac energy  and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657241>Transcerebral exchange kinetics of large neutral amino  during acute inspiratory hypoxia in humans.</a></h2><p>Hypoxaemia is present in many critically ill patients, and may contribute to encephalopathy. Changes in the passage of large neutral amino  (LNAAs) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with an increased cerebral influx of aromatic amino  into the brain may concurrently be present and also contribute to encephalopathy, but it has not been established whether hypoxaemia  may trigger such changes. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 11 healthy men using the Kety-Schmidt technique and obtained paired arterial and jugular-venous blood samples for the determination of LNAAs by high performance liquid chromatography at baseline and after 9 hours of poikilocapnic normobaric hypoxia (12% O). Transcerebral net exchange was determined by the Fick principle, and transport of LNAAs across the BBB was determined mathematically. Hypoxia increased both the systemic and corresponding cerebral delivery of the aromatic amino  phenylalanine, and the branched-chain amino  leucine and isoleucine. Despite this, the transcerebral net exchange values and mathematically derived brain extracellular concentrations for all LNAAs were unaffected. In conclusion, the observed changes in circulating LNAAs triggered by hypoxaemia do not affect the transcerebral exchange kinetics of LNAAs to such an extent that their brain extracellular concentrations are affected.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672943>TFEB activation in macrophages attenuates postmyocardial infarction ventricular dysfunction independently of ATG5-mediated autophagy.</a></h2><p>Lysosomes are at the epicenter of cellular processes critical for inflammasome activation in macrophages. Inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion are implicated in myocardial infarction (MI) and resultant heart failure; however, little is known about how macrophage lysosomes regulate these processes. In mice subjected to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and humans with ischemic cardiomyopathy, we observed evidence of lysosomal impairment in macrophages. Inducible macrophage-specific overexpression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis (Mϕ-TFEB), attenuated postinfarction remodeling, decreased abundance of proinflammatory macrophages, and reduced levels of myocardial IL-1β compared with controls. Surprisingly, neither inflammasome suppression nor Mϕ-TFEB-mediated attenuation of postinfarction myocardial dysfunction required intact ATG5-dependent macroautophagy (hereafter termed "autophagy"). RNA-seq of flow-sorted macrophages postinfarction revealed that Mϕ-TFEB upregulated key targets involved in lysosomal lipid . Specifically, inhibition of the TFEB target, lysosomal  lipase, in vivo abrogated the beneficial effect of Mϕ-TFEB on postinfarction ventricular function. Thus, TFEB reprograms macrophage lysosomal lipid  to attenuate remodeling after IR, suggesting an alternative paradigm whereby lysosome function affects inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655859>Deletion of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 knocks mitochondria down triggering  rewiring in yeast.</a></h2><p>The Voltage-Dependent Anion-selective Channel (VDAC) is the pore-forming protein of mitochondrial outer membrane, allowing metabolites and ions exchanges. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete  rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the glycolysis-derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate lipid droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol. Such unexpected re-arrangement of whole  suggests a regulatory role of VDAC1 in cell bioenergetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669636>RNA-Seq comparative analysis reveals the response of Enterococcus faecalis TV4 under fluoride exposure.</a></h2><p>Enterococcus faecalis is one of the main components of symbiotic bacteria in the intestine of silkworm (Bombyx mori L.). The abundance of E. faecalis in the intestine of silkworm is affected by fluoride exposure. However, the response mechanism of E. faecalis toward fluoride remains largely unknown. In this study, a strain of E. faecalis (named TV4), which is a symbiotic bacteria of silkworm, was isolated and characterized. Inhibition assay showed that fluoride could significantly inhibit the growth of the TV4 strain (P<0.05) after culture for 4 h. Finally, Illumina X-Ten platform was used to investigate the response mechanism of E. faecalis TV4 under fluoride exposure. We found that the TV4 strain demonstrated significant changes in its carbohydrate transport and  and energy . The transcriptome sequencing results revealed that 237 genes were differentially expressed for TV4 grown after fluoride exposure, i.e., 92 genes were differentially up-regulated and 145 genes were differentially down-regulated. Many of the down-regulated genes were involved in cell carbohydrate transport and  and energy production, whereas the up-regulated genes were mostly related to ethanolamine utilization and amino  synthesis and . Our results revealed that strain TV4 reduced its carbohydrate  and energy  and increased ethanolamine utilization and amino   to adapt and survive under fluoride exposure. This study enhances our understanding about the response mechanism of E. faecalis after fluoride exposure and has important implications for investigations on the three-way interaction among fluoride, symbiotic bacteria and silkworm.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Due to its robust properties, it is also increasingly considered for use as a cell factory. It produces several industrially important compounds such as 1,3-propanediol and reuterin natively, but for cell factory purposes, developing improved strategies for engineering and fermentation optimization is crucial. Genome-scale  models can be highly beneficial in guiding rational  engineering. Reconstructing a reliable and a quantitatively accurate  model requires extensive manual curation and incorporation of experimental data.A genome-scale  model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 was reconstructed and the resulting model, Lreuteri_530, was validated and tested with experimental data. Several knowledge gaps in the  were identified and resolved during this process, including presence/absence of glycolytic genes. Flux distribution between the two glycolytic , the phosphoketolase and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas , varies considerably between LAB species and strains. As these  result in different energy yields, it is important to include strain-specific utilization of these  in the model. We determined experimentally that the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway carried at most 7% of the total glycolytic flux. Predicted growth rates from Lreuteri_530 were in good agreement with experimentally determined values. To further validate the prediction accuracy of Lreuteri_530, the predicted effects of glycerol addition and adhE gene knock-out, which results in impaired ethanol production, were compared to in vivo data. Examination of both growth rates and uptake- and secretion rates of the main metabolites in central  demonstrated that the model was able to accurately predict the experimentally observed effects. Lastly, the potential of L. reuteri as a cell factory was investigated, resulting in a number of general  engineering strategies.We have constructed a manually curated genome-scale  model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 that has been experimentally parameterized and validated and can accurately predict  behavior of this important platform cell factory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659118>Promoter demethylation of the asparagine synthetase gene is required for an ATF4-dependent adaptation to asparagine depletion.</a></h2><p>Tumor cells adapt to nutrient-limiting environments by inducing gene expression that ensures adequate nutrients to sustain  demands. For example, during amino  limitations, ATF4 in the amino  response induces expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), which provides for asparagine biosynthesis. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are sensitive to asparagine depletion, and administration of the asparagine-depletion enzyme L-asparaginase is an important therapy option. ASNS expression can counterbalance L-asparaginase treatment by mitigating nutrient stress. Therefore understanding the mechanisms regulating ASNS expression is important to define the adaptive processes underlying tumor progression and treatment. Here, we show that DNA hypermethylation at the ASNS promoter prevents its transcriptional expression following asparagine depletion. Insufficient expression of ASNS leads to asparagine deficiency, which facilitates an ATF4-independent induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) that triggers apoptosis. We conclude that chromatin accessibility is critical for ATF4 activity at the ASNS promoter, which can switch ALL cells from an ATF4-dependent adaptive response to ATF4-independent apoptosis during asparagine depletion.  This work may also help explain why ALL cells are most sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment when compared to other cancers.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650666>GATA-type transcriptional factor Gat1 regulates nitrogen uptake and polymalic  biosynthesis in polyextremotolerant fungus Aureobasidium pullulans.</a></h2><p>Polymalic  (PMA) is a novel biopolymer produced by the polyextremotolerant fungus Aureobasidium pullulans. In this study, a GATA-family transcriptional factor, Gat1, which regulates nitrogen uptake and PMA biosynthesis, was investigated. PMA production increased to 11.2% in the mutant overexpressing gat1, but decreased to 49.1% of the PMA titer when gat1 was knocked out from the genome of A. pullulans. Comparative transcriptome analysis of wide-type and mutant strains (∆gat1 and OE::gat1) revealed that 23 common differentially expressed genes were related to oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome biogenesis, and nitrogen . Under nitrogen-limited stress, regardless of the preferred nitrogen (glutamine, Gln) or non-preferred nitrogen (proline, Pro), 70% of Gat1 in the cells was located in the nucleus-cytoplasm, which resulted in an increase in nitrogen uptake and PMA biosynthesis regulation. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that glucosekinase (GLK) in the glycolytic pathway and malate synthase (MLS) in the glyoxylate shunt pathway may be cross-regulated by Gat1 and nitrogen concentration (Gln or Pro), Therefore, glk was overexpressed in mutant strain (OE::gat1), which resulted in an increased PMA titer and yield of 12.6% and 13.0%, respectively.

We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and other  factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino  and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.2% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve  of phospholipid , carnitine , and development of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652267>Comparative characterization of bacterial communities in geese consuming of different proportions of ryegrass.</a></h2><p>Geese are extremely well-adapted to utilizing plant-derived roughage in their diet, so the grass must be added to commercial diets under intensive rearing systems. However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.5:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut microbiota of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading microbiota such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut microbiota were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate  and amino   were dominant  . Lipid  was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading microbiota (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid  pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649646>Microbial  Capacity for Intestinal Folate Production and Modulation of Host Folate Receptors.</a></h2><p>Microbial metabolites, including B complex vitamins contribute to diverse aspects of human health. Folate, or vitamin B, refers to a broad category of biomolecules that include pterin, para-aminobenzoic  (pABA), and glutamate subunits. Folates are required for DNA synthesis and epigenetic regulation. In addition to dietary nutrients, the gut microbiota has been recognized as a source of B complex vitamins, including folate. This study evaluated the predicted folate synthesis capabilities in the genomes of human commensal microbes identified in the Human Microbiome Project and folate production by representative strains of six human intestinal bacterial phyla. Bacterial folate synthesis genes were ubiquitous across 512 gastrointestinal reference genomes with 13% of the genomes containing all genes required for complete  folate synthesis. An additional 39% of the genomes had the genetic capacity to synthesize folates in the presence of pABA, an upstream intermediate that can be obtained through diet or from other intestinal microbes. Bacterial folate synthesis was assessed during exponential and stationary phase growth through the evaluation of expression of select folate synthesis genes, quantification of total folate production, and analysis of folate polyglutamylation. Increased expression of key folate synthesis genes was apparent in exponential phase, and increased folate polyglutamylation occurred during late stationary phase. Of the folate producers, we focused on the commensal  to examine host-microbe interactions in relation to folate and examined folate receptors in the physiologically relevant human enteroid model. RNAseq data revealed segment-specific folate receptor distribution. Treatment of human colonoid monolayers with conditioned media (CM) from wild-type  did not influence the expression of key folate transporters proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) or reduced folate carrier (RFC). However, CM from  containing a site-specific inactivation of the  gene, which prevents the bacteria from synthesizing a polyglutamate tail on folate, significantly upregulated RFC expression. No effects were observed using  with a site inactivation of , which results in no folate production. This work sheds light on the contributions of microbial folate to overall folate status and mammalian host .Copyright © 2019 Engevik, Morra, Röth, Engevik, Spinler, Devaraj, Crawford, Estes, Kalkum and Versalovic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668688>Metabolomics of Aerobic Exercise in Chronic Stroke Survivors: A Pilot Study.</a></h2><p>Understanding the  response to exercise may aid in optimizing stroke management. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate plasma metabolomic profiles in chronic stroke survivors following aerobic exercise training.Participants (age: 62 ± 1 years, body mass index: 31 ± 1 kg/m, mean ± standard error of the mean) were randomized to 6 months of treadmill exercise (N = 17) or whole-body stretching (N = 8) with preintervention and postintervention measurement of aerobic capacity (VOpeak). Linear models for microarray data expression analysis was performed to determine  changes over time, and Mummichog was used for pathway enrichment analysis following analysis of plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry.VOpeak change was greater following exercise than stretching (18.9% versus -.2%; P < .01). Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites results showed significant enrichment in 4  following treadmill exercise, 3 of which (heparan-, chondroitin-, keratan-sulfate degradation) involved connective tissue  and the fourth involve lipid signaling (linoleate ). More  were altered in pre and post comparisons of stretching, including branched-chain amino , tryptophan, tyrosine, and urea cycle, which could indicate loss of lean body mass.These preliminary data show different  changes due to treadmill training and stretching in chronic stroke survivors and suggest that in addition to improved aerobic capacity, weight-bearing activity, like walking, could protect against loss of lean body mass. Future studies are needed to examine the relationship between changes in metabolomic profiles to reductions in cardiometabolic risk after treadmill rehabilitation.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654213>Protein secretion in wild-type and Othac1 mutant strains of thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Ogataea thermomethanolica TBRC656.</a></h2><p>In yeasts, Hac1 transcription factor of the unfolded protein response (UPR) regulates many genes involved in secretory .

In a recent study, we suggested a third pathway for SA biosynthesis from mandelonitrile (MD) in peach plants. This pathway is alternative to the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase pathway and links SA biosynthesis and cyanogenesis. In the present work, by biochemical approaches, we studied the effect of salt stress and Plum pox virus (PPV) infection on this proposed SA biosynthetic pathway from MD. Peach plants were submitted to salt stress and Plum pox virus (PPV) infection. We studied the levels of SA and its intermediates/precursors (Phe, MD, amygdalin and benzoic ) in in vitro shoots. Moreover, in peach seedlings we analyzed the content of H2O2-related enzymes, SA and the stress-related hormones abscisic  and jasmonic . We showed that the contribution of this SA biosynthetic pathway from MD to the total SA pool does not seem to be important under the stress conditions assayed. Nevertheless, MD treatment not only affected the SA content, but it also had a pleiotropic effect on abscisic  and jasmonic  levels. Furthermore, MD modulates the antioxidative  via SA-dependent or -independent redox-related signaling . Even thought that the proposed SA biosynthetic pathway seems to be functional under stress conditions, MD, and hence CNglcs, may be operating more broadly than by influencing SA  and signaling. Thus, the physiological function of the proposed SA biosynthetic pathway remains to be elucidated.© 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670366>Collaborative effects of chlorogenic  and caffeine on lipid  via the AMPKα-LXRα/SREBP-1c pathway in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>To investigate the mechanism of the combined effects of chlorogenic  (CGA) and caffeine on lipid  in high-fat diet-induced obese mice, eighty female ICR mice were randomly divided into eight groups and fed with a high-fat diet with/without CGA and/or caffeine for 14 weeks. The combination of CGA and caffeine effectively decreased body weight gain, intraperitoneal adipose tissue weight, serum LDL-c, FFA, TC, TG, leptin, IL-6 concentrations, and hepatic TG and TC levels and increased the serum adiponectin level. The CGA and caffeine combination also promoted the phosphorylation of AMPKα, inhibited the expressions of transcriptional regulators (SREBP-1c and LXRα), and decreased the expressions of FAS and HMGR. Besides, the expressions of ACO, ATGL and HSL were increased by the CGA and caffeine combinations. The results indicated that the combination of CGA and caffeine had anti-obesity effects and regulated lipid  in high-fat diet-induced obese mice via the AMPKα-LXRα/SREBP-1c signaling pathway.

Novel disease biomarkers and curative treatment options are strongly needed.To apply untargeted metabolomic profiling to identify pathogenic mechanisms and candidate disease biomarkers in FA.Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on serum samples of children with either FA alone, asthma alone or both FA and asthma as well as healthy pediatric controls.In this pilot study FA subjects exhibited a disease-specific metabolomic signature as compared to both control subjects and asthmatics. In particular, FA was uniquely associated with a marked decrease in sphingolipids, as well as a number of other lipid metabolites, in the face of normal frequencies of circulating natural killer T (NKT) cells. Specific comparison of FA and asthmatic subjects revealed differences in the microbiota-sensitive aromatic amino  and secondary bile  . Children with both FA and asthma exhibited a metabolomic profile that aligned with that of FA alone but not asthma. Among children with FA, history of severe systemic reactions and presence of multiple FA were associated with changes in tryptophan metabolites, eicosanoids, plasmalogens, and fatty .Children with FA display a disease-specific metabolomic profile that is informative of disease mechanisms and severity, and which dominates in the presence of asthma. Lower levels of sphingolipids and ceramides and other metabolomic alterations observed in FA children may reflect the interplay between an altered microbiota and immune cell subsets in the gut.Copyright © 2019.

However, the effects on nutrient absorption and rumen function induced by excessive iron have not been well understood. Therefore, the purpose of present study was to investigate the impact of over-load iron on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood biochemistry, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep. Twenty-four German Mutton Merino cross-bred sheep with weight (42.66 ± 2.34 kg BW) were randomly divided into 4 groups, each with 6 replicates and 1 sheep per replicate. The basal diet consisted of 60% Leymus chinensis hay and 40% concentrate. The sheep in 4 groups were fed the basal diets supplemented with 50 (Control), 500 (T1), 1,000 (T2) and 1,500 (T3) mg Fe/kg as ferrous sulphate monohydrate (FeSO ·H O) respectively. And the actual contents of iron in the diet were determined to be 457.68 (control), 816.42 (T1), 1,256.78 (T2) and 1,725.63 (T3) mg/kg respectively. The experiment lasted 62 days including a 7-day  trial. During the whole experiment, the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fibre and  detergent fibre showed a quadratic increase with increasing over-load iron levels (p < .05), and maximum responses were found with 500 mg/kg supplementation. However, the response of total VFA concentration showed a quadratic decrease, as did the concentrations of propionate, butyrate and valerate (p < .05). Serum total iron-binding capacity on day 30 showed a quadratic decrease with the increase in high-dose iron, while the serum iron content increased linearly at day 60 (p < .05). Excessive iron resulted in the change in bacterial communities. An increase in over-load iron linearly decreased the abundance of bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes (p < .05), but linearly increased the Firmicutes (p = .037) and Proteobacteria (p = .018). In addition, there was a quadratic effect (p = .003) on the Fibrobacteres, which was higher in the 500 and 1,000 mg/kg Fe-supplemented groups. At the genus level, there were quadratic effects on the abundances of Selenomonas_1 (p = .023) and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 (p = .016). Furthermore, feeding of iron linearly increased the relative abundances of Succiniclasticum and Succinivibrionaceae_UCG-002 (p < .05). These results indicate that increasing ferrous sulphate monohydrate in diets had no negative impact on the growth performance, but it changed nutrient digestibility, blood iron parameters, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672987>Rewiring carbon  in yeast for high level production of aromatic chemicals.</a></h2><p>The production of bioactive plant compounds using microbial hosts is considered a safe, cost-competitive and scalable approach to their production.

In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty  uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto  decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic  cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino  catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino  transaminase, branched-chain α-keto  dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino , thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino  in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino , as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino , alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino  catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino  catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric , increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric  concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs , adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of diabetes and how exercise improves diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661482>[Identification of the Molecular Partners of Lymphocyte Phosphatase-Associated Phosphoprotein (LPAP) That Are Involved in Human Lymphocyte Activation].</a></h2><p>Lymphocyte phosphatase-associated phosphoprotein (LPAP) is a small transmembrane protein that is found in lymphocytes and is tightly associated with the phosphatase CD45. The function of LPAP is still unknown. Studies of the LPAP interactome may reveal new details of how C45 and lymphocyte signaling in general are regulated. LPAP binding partners were sought using coimmunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, stabilization of protein complexes with chemical crosslinkers, and Blue Native electrophoresis. In addition to CD45, several proteins were identified as LPAP partners, including CD71, CD98, cytoskeletal proteins, the amino  transporter SLC1A4, and the cell signaling component HS1. It was confirmed that more than 70% of LPAP molecules were bound with CD45 in a 1 : 1 complex. The effect of CD45 on LPAP was studied in CEM and Jurkat cells with a CD45 knockout. The LPAP levels in the cells were 10% of the level in wild-type cells. In the absence of CD45, LPAP phosphorylation at Ser-153 and Ser-163 was not affected, whereas phosphorylation at Ser-99 and Ser-172 decreased significantly. Based on the results, CD45 was assumed to play a role in regulating LPAP expression and phosphorylation status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661119>Glutamine affects T24 bladder cancer cell proliferation by activating STAT3 through ROS and glutaminolysis.</a></h2><p>Changes in  are common phenomena in tumors. Glutamine (Gln) has been documented to play a critical role in tumor growth. In this study, we aimed to to explore the mechanisms through which bladder cancer cells utilize Gln to fulfill their biosynthetic needs during proliferation. In addition, the roles of Gln in the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression were examined in vitro in the T24 bladder cancer cell line. The results revealed that the T24 cell line was markedly Gln‑dependent and that Gln supplementation promoted T24 proliferation through the actions of Gln as a ROS moderator and as a  fuel in the TCA cycle. Importantly, extracellular Gln deprivation deregulated the production of the transcription factor, STAT3. Additionally, STAT3 expression was affected by the degree of Gln , as regulated by Gln intermediates and ROS. Thus, on the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that Gln promotes the proliferation of the Gln‑dependent bladder cancer cell line, T24, by supplementing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and neutralizing ROS to activate the STAT3 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high-fat and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut microbiota regulation.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high fat and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related  abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related  indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid , transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid  including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658997>Inflammation triggers liver X receptor-dependent lipogenesis.</a></h2><p>Immune cell function can be modulated by changes in lipid . Our studies indicate that cholesterol and fatty  synthesis increases in macrophages between 12 and 18 hours after the activation of toll-like receptors with pro-inflammatory stimuli and that up-regulation of lipogenesis may contribute to the resolution of inflammation. The inflammation-dependent increase in lipogenesis requires induction of the liver X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for liver X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that liver X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, liver X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Liver X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as inflammation subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649131>EVI1 triggers  reprogramming associated with leukemogenesis and increases sensitivity to L-asparaginase.</a></h2><p> reprogramming of leukemia cells is important for survival, proliferation, and drug resistance under conditions of  stress in the bone marrow. Deregulation of cellular , leading to development of leukemia, occurs through abnormally high expression of transcription factors such as MYC and Ecotropic Virus Integration site 1 protein homolog (EVI1). Overexpression of EVI1 in adults and children with mixed lineage leukemia-rearrangement acute myeloid leukemia (MLL-r AML) has a very poor prognosis. To identify a  inhibitor for EVI1-induced  reprogramming in MLL-r AML, we used an XFp extracellular flux analyzer to examine  changes during leukemia development in mouse models of AML expressing MLL-AF9 and Evi1 (Evi1/MF9). Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in Evi1/MF9 AML cells accelerated prior to activation of glycolysis, with a higher dependency on glutamine as an energy source. Furthermore, EVI1 played a role in glycolysis as well as driving production of metabolites in the tricarboxylic  cycle. L-asparaginase (L-asp) exacerbated growth inhibition induced by glutamine starvation and suppressed OXPHOS and proliferation of Evi1/MF9 both in vitro and in vivo; high sensitivity to L-asp was caused by low expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and L-asp-induced suppression of glutamine . Also, samples from patients with EVI1+MF9 showed low ASNS expression, suggesting that it is a sensitive marker of L-asp treatment. Clarification of  reprogramming in EVI1+ leukemia cells may aid development of treatments for EVI1+MF9 refractory leukemia.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652707>Exploring the Phytochemical Landscape of the Early-Diverging Flowering Plant  Baill.</a></h2><p>Although the evolutionary significance of the early-diverging flowering plant  ( Baill.) is widely recognized, its  landscape, particularly specialized metabolites, is currently underexplored. In this work, we analyzed the metabolomes of  tissues using liquid chromatography high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-HR-ESI-MS). By matching the mass spectra of  metabolites with those of authentic phytochemical standards in the publicly accessible libraries, 63, 39, and 21 compounds were tentatively identified in leaves, stems, and roots, respectively. Free amino , organic , simple sugars, cofactors, as well as abundant glycosylated and/or methylated phenolic specialized metabolites were observed in  leaves.

We tested how a graded reduction in insulin impacts the source of FA used by cardiomyocytes and the cardiac adaptations required to process these FA. Methods and Results Rats injected with 55 (D55) or 100 (D100) mg/kg streptozotocin were terminated after 4 days. Although D55 and D100 were equally hyperglycemic, D100 showed markedly lower pancreatic and plasma insulin and loss of lipoprotein lipase, which in D55 hearts had expanded. There was minimal change in plasma FA in D55. However, D100 exhibited a 2- to 3-fold increase in various saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA in the plasma. D100 demonstrated dramatic cardiac transcriptomic changes with 1574 genes differentially expressed compared with only 49 in D55. Augmented mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation in D100 was not matched by elevated tricarboxylic  or oxidative phosphorylation. With increasing FA, although control myocytes responded by augmenting basal respiration, this was minimized in D55 and reversed in D100. Metabolomic profiling identified significant lipid accumulation in D100 hearts, which also exhibited sizeable change in genes related to apoptosis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells. Conclusions With increasing severity of diabetes mellitus, when the diabetic heart is unable to control its own FA supply using lipoprotein lipase, it undergoes dramatic reprogramming that is linked to handling of excess FA that arise from adipose tissue. This transition results in a cardiac  signature that embraces mitochondrial FA overload, oxidative stress, triglyceride storage, and cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654570>Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction via regulation of AMPK signaling and lipid .</a></h2><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is known as a potent  regulator but its protective mechanisms against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory  whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid  in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic  (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq.

Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty  (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

However, the molecular mechanisms have not been clarified.In our study, the relative expression level of PRRX1 was detected, its relationship with free fatty  (FFA) and PPARG2 was analysed in 85 SACC tissues and 15 salivary glands from the benign salivary tumours. We also compared the FFAs composition and levels in these SACC cells. PPARG2 was detected in PRRX1-induced FFAs treatment as well as Src and MMP-9 were detected in FFAs treatment-induced invasion and migration of SACC cells, and ChIP test was performed to identify the target interactions.Our data showed that overexpression of PRRX1 induced EMT and facilitated the invasion and migration of SACC cells, and PRRX1 expression was closely associated with high FFAs level and poor prognosis of SACC patients. Furthermore, PRRX1 silence led to the increase of PPARG2 and the reduction of FFAs level and the migration and invasion of SACC cells. And inhibition of PPARG2 rescued FFAs level and migration and invasion capabilities of SACC cells. Free fatty  treatment induced an increase of Stat5-DNA binding activity via Src- and MMP-9-dependent pathway.Collectively, our findings showed that the PRRX1/PPARG2/FFAs signalling in SACC was important for accelerating tumour metastasis through the induction of EMT and the  reprogramming of FFAs.© 2019 The Authors.

SCFAs are known to improve host  but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL, 2 mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid  related stearic  and glycerol-2-phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic , fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic ; and decreased levels of the amino   products aspartic  and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited fatty  synthesis and promoted lipid  process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased glycolysis. Taken together, these data support a role of the SCFA propionate on host lipid and glucose .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654214>Molecular cloning and functional analysis of lotus salt-induced NnDREB2C, NnPIP1-2 and NnPIP2-1 in Arabidopsis thaliana.</a></h2><p>Dehydration-responsive element bindings transcription factor (DREBs) and plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) have been characterized multi-functions in plant growth and , as well as in the adaptation to various stresses. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of NnDREB2C from a salt-tolerated lotus species with RT-PCR methods. Analysis of qRT-PCR demonstrated that NnDREB2C mRNA in the leaf dramatically increased after the treatments of NaCl, abscisic , low temperature and mannitol. Next, NnDREB2C was cloned into constitutive expression vector pSN1301, which in turn transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate its function in plants. NnDREB2C overexpression significantly elevated Arabidopsis tolerance against salt and drought stresses, showing higher survival rates, lower conductivity and more chlorophyll content than those of wild-type plants. Moreover, higher germination rates were observed in the NnDREB2C overproducing plants when subjected into the stresses of NaCl and mannitol. Furthermore, we investigate the potential down-stream genes regulated by NnDREB2C and observed a significant increase in expressions of several genes belonging to PIPs family, including PIP1-1, PIP1-2, PIP1-3, PIP1-4 and PIP1-5. Consistently, overexpressed NnPIP1-2 and NnPIP2-1 conferred Arabidopsis the tolerance to stresses. Taken together, we concluded that overexpression of NnDREB2C enhanced the tolerance of salt and drought stresses in plants, which might probably be derived from the increased expression of the genes belonging to PIPs family.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673536>Perioperative characteristics and management of liver transplantation for isolated methylmalonic acidemia-the largest experience in China.</a></h2><p>There are few detailed consensus and guidelines on perioperative clinical characteristics of liver transplantation (LT) in patients with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA). This retrospective study investigated details of the clinical course and individualized treatment plan of the center with largest experience in China.A total of 7 MMA patients undergoing LT in Beijing Friendship Hospital from June 2013 to December 2017 were enrolled in the study, whose clinical data (clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chronological changes in urine MMA levels, treatment, etc.) during perioperative period were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients received strict postoperative management.All the 7 cases were confirmed to have isolated MMA, among which, 3 cases received living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), 4 cases received deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). A wild fluctuate of  condition was observed within the first few days after surgery and two weeks after LT, the mean base excess of blood value (BE-B) restored to normal whereas plasma bicarbonate (HCO ) was still below normal value even with intermittent sodium bicarbonate correction. It also showed marked reduction in propionylcarnitine (C3) and C3/C2 level and the mean urine MMA by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was reduced by 81.7% (P<0.01) but remained >72× higher than upper limit of normal. The -correcting medications were administered as before. The renal function of one case with renal insufficiency before LT (serum creatinine rising) maintained stable by adjusting the immunosuppressive regimen during the observation period. All patients survive to date.LT is an effective treatment to prevent  crisis, but patients with MMA tend to be metabolically fragile even after surgery. During perioperative period, close monitoring should be given for acidosis episodes so as to implement sodium bicarbonate correction. -correcting medications are still needed.

Previous studies demonstrated hydrogen bonds between amino  side chains and DNA bases play major roles in specific protein-DNA interactions. In this paper, we investigated the roles of individual DNA strands and protein secondary structure types in specific protein-DNA recognition based on side chain-base hydrogen bonds. By comparing the contribution of each DNA strand to the overall binding specificity between DNA-binding proteins with different degrees of binding specificity, we found that highly specific DNA-binding proteins show balanced hydrogen bonding with each of the two DNA strands while multi-specific DNA binding proteins are generally biased towards one strand. Protein-base pair hydrogen bonds, in which both bases of a base pair are involved in forming hydrogen bonds with amino  side chains, are more prevalent in the highly specific protein-DNA complexes than those in the multi-specific group. Amino  involved in side chain-base hydrogen bonds favor strand and coil secondary structure types in highly specific DNA-binding proteins while multi-specific DNA-binding proteins prefer helices.© The Author(s) 2019.

The growth status of abdominal fat during postnatal late development ultimately affects meat yield and quality in chickens. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Studies have shown that miRNAs play an important role in the biological processes involved in adipose tissue development. However, few studies have investigated miRNA expression profiles and their interaction  associated with the postnatal late development of abdominal adipose tissue in chickens.We constructed four small RNA libraries from abdominal adipose tissue obtained from Chinese domestic Gushi chickens at 6, 14, 22, and 30 weeks. A total of 507 known miRNAs and 53 novel miRNAs were identified based on the four small RNA libraries. Fifty-one significant differentially expressed (SDE) miRNAs were identified from six combinations by comparative analysis, and the expression patterns of these SDE miRNAs were divided into six subclusters by cluster analysis. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the SDE miRNAs were primarily involved in the regulation of fat cell differentiation, regulation of lipid , regulation of fatty  , and unsaturated fatty   in the lipid - or deposition-related biological process categories. In addition, we constructed differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA interaction  related to abdominal adipose development. The results showed that miRNA families, such as mir-30, mir-34, mir-199, mir-8, and mir-146, may have key roles in lipid , adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and cell junctions during abdominal adipose tissue development in chickens.This study determined the dynamic miRNA transcriptome and characterized the miRNA-mRNA interaction  in Gushi chicken abdominal adipose tissue for the first time. The results expanded the number of known miRNAs in abdominal adipose tissue and provide novel insights and a valuable resource to elucidate post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms during postnatal late development of abdominal adipose tissue in chicken.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649873>ACAT1 and -Related  Are Essential for the Progression of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC), as Determined by Co-expression Network Analysis.</a></h2><p>Kidney cancer ranks as one of the top 10 causes of cancer death; this cancer is difficult to detect, difficult to treat, and poorly understood. The most common subtype of kidney cancer is clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and its progression is influenced by complex gene interactions. Few clinical studies have investigated the molecular markers associated with the progression of ccRCC. In this study, we collected microarray profiles of 72 ccRCCs and matched normal samples to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to identify co-expressed gene modules. By relating all co-expressed modules to clinical features, we found that the brown module and Fuhrman grade had the highest correlation ( = -0.8,  = 1e-09). Thus, the brown module was regarded as a clinically significant module and subsequently analyzed. Functional annotation showed that the brown module focused on -related biological processes and , such as fatty  oxidation and amino  . We then performed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to identify the hub nodes in the brown module. It is worth noting that only one candidate, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT1), was considered to be the final target most relevant to the Fuhrman grade of ccRCC, by applying the intersection of hub genes in the co-expressed network and the PPI network. ACAT1 was subsequently validated using another two external microarray datasets and the TCGA dataset. Intriguingly, validation results indicated that ACAT1 was negatively correlated with four grades of ccRCC, which was also consistent with our results from qRT-PCR analysis and immunohistochemistry staining of clinical samples. Overexpression of ACAT1 inhibited the proliferation and migration of human ccRCC cells . In addition, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that patients with a lower expression of ACAT1 showed a significantly lower overall survival rate and disease-free survival rate, indicating that ACAT1 could act as a prognostic and recurrence/progression biomarker of ccRCC. In summary, we found and confirmed that ACAT1 might help to identify the progression of ccRCC, which might have important clinical implications for enhancing risk stratification, therapeutic decision, and prognosis prediction in ccRCC patients.Copyright © 2019 Chen, Peng, Luo, Zhou, Wang, Qian, Xiao and Wang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673279>Metabolomics profiling of Polygoni Multiflori Radix and Polygoni Multiflori Radix Preparata extracts using UPLC-Q/TOF-MS.</a></h2><p>The side effects caused by Polygoni Multiflori Radix (PMR) and Polygoni Multiflori Radix Praeparata (PMRP) have often appeared globally.

Screening a panel of field Leptosphaeria isolates from B. napus for the presence of mycoviruses revealed the presence of a novel dsRNA quadrivirus in L. biglobosa and no viruses in L. maculans. Following elimination of the mycovirus, virus-infected and virus-free isogenic lines of L. biglobosa were created. A direct comparison of the growth and virulence of these isogenic lines illustrated that virus infection caused hypervirulence and resulted in induced systemic resistance towards L. maculans in B. napus following lower leaf pre-inoculation with the virus-infected isolate. Analysis of the plant transcriptome suggests that the presence of the virus leads to subtle alterations in  and plant defences. For instance, transcripts involved in carbohydrate and amino   are enriched in plants treated with the virus-infected isolate, while pathogenesis-related proteins, chitinases and WRKY transcription factors are differentially expressed.

These two enantiomers behave differently in the environment due to enantioselective catabolism by microorganisms. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this enantioselective catabolism remain largely unknown. In this study, the genes (snaH and snpd) involved in the catabolism of NAP were cloned from Sphingobium sp. B2, which was capable of catabolizing both NAP enantiomers. Compared to (R)-NAP, (S)-NAP was much more rapidly transformed by the amidase SnaH, which initially cleaved the amide bonds of (S)/(R)-NAP to form (S)/(R)-2-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-propanoic  ((S)/(R)-NP) and diethylamine. The α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase Snpd, showing strict stereoselectivity for (S)-NP, further transformed (S)-NP to 1-naphthol and pyruvate. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis analyses revealed that when the (S)-enantiomers of NAP and NP occupied the active sites, the distance between the ligand molecule and the coordination atom was shorter than that when the (R)-enantiomers occupied the active sites, which facilitated formation of the transition state complex.

The cells were able to reduce nitrate under aerobic conditions, which is the first report in the genus Salicibibacter. The genome size and genomic G + C content of strain NKC3-5 were 3,754,174 bp and 45.9 mol%, respectively; it contained 3,630 coding sequences, 16S rRNA genes (six 16S, five 5S, and five 23S), and 59 tRNA genes.

Native oysters are routinely exposed to a complex mixture of contaminants that increasingly includes pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Unfortunately, the biological effects of chemical mixtures on oysters are poorly understood. Untargeted GC-MS metabolomics was utilized to quantify the response of oysters exposed to fluoxetine, N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), diphenhydramine, and their mixture. Oysters were exposed to 1 µg/L of each chemical or mixture for ten days, followed by an eight-day depuration period. Adductor muscle (n = 14/treatment) was sampled at days 0, 1, 5, 10 and 18. Trajectory analysis illustrated that  effects and class separation of the treatments varied at each time point and that overall, the oysters were only able to partially recover from these exposures post-depuration. Altered metabolites were associated with cellular energetics (i.e., Krebs cycle intermediates), as well as amino   and the urea cycle. Exposure to these PPCPs also affected   associated with anaerobic , osmotic stress, and oxidative stress, in addition to the physiological effects of each chemical's postulated mechanism of action. Following depuration, there were fewer metabolites altered, but none of the treatments returned to their initial control values, indicating that  disruptions were long-lasting.

Its major enzymatic function is incision of AP sites. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) modifies itself and target proteins with poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), contributing to regulation of many processes. To understand molecular basis of functional cooperation between APE1 and PARP1 in BER, we examined PAR-binding activity and ADP-ribosylation of human APE1 in comparison with known targets of PARP1, using the full-length, N-terminally truncated and catalytically inactive forms of APE1. The protein binds preferentially large ADP-ribose polymers, being very similar to DNA polymerase β (Polβ) but contrasting with the scaffold XRCC1 protein. The interaction with PAR involves the universally conserved catalytic portion and the eukaryote-specific extension of APE1. The ADP-ribosylation of APE1 depends on the structure of PARP1-activating DNA, contrasting APE1 with Polβ and XRCC1. Relative levels of APE1 modification in the presence of different DNA substrates were found to correlate with affinities of the DNAs for APE1 and substrate activities in the enzymatic incision, suggesting the ADP-ribosylation to occur within the DNA-mediated ternary complex. This conclusion was confirmed by importance of the length of DNA region 3' to the AP site for the modification. Deletion of the N-terminal extension of APE1 produced no significant influence on both the ADP-ribosylation efficiency and hydrolytic stability of the modified protein, suggesting localization of target amino  in the conserved catalytic portion. The most efficient ADP-ribosylation of the catalytically inactive APE1 mutant was shown to reduce the level of PARP1 automodification, suggesting possible role of APE1 in modulating PARP1 activity. Our data on primary role of DNA in controlling the PARP-catalysed modification provide new insights into mechanisms of protein targeting for ADP-ribosylation.Copyright © 2019.

There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular lipid  contributes to malignant transformation and progression. Lipid  is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic colonization and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of mitochondria were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of mitochondria, which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of mitochondria causing deficits in the respiration/energy-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and energy balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer. The study may open the way to the development of rational therapeutic combinations based on the use of ATRA and anti-tumor agents targeting the mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666203>1-O-alkyl glycerophosphate-induced CD36 expression drives oxidative stress in microglial cells.</a></h2><p>Microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages in the central nervous system, are important for the initiation and perpetuation of neuroinflammation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a ligand-inducible transcription factor and plays an important role in fatty  . Our previous study found that 1-O-alkyl glycerophosphate (AGP), a naturally occurring ether analog of lysophosphatidic , is a high-affinity, partial agonist of PPARγ. In this study, we investigated the role of AGP in microglial activation and illustrated the underlying molecular mechanism. We found that AGP treatment increased the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and induced PPARγ activation in microglial cells. Interestingly, AGP also up-regulated the expression levels of the cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) scavenger receptor, a high-affinity receptor for oxidized low-density lipoproteins. The findings suggest that AGP induces PPARγ activation, enhances CD36 expression and increases the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in microglial cells.Copyright © 2019.

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid  in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis. This is consistent with the recent suggestion that PGC-1α might not be a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650389>Hypouricemia: what the practicing rheumatologist should know about this condition.</a></h2><p>We presented an update in the field of hypouricemia, which is defined as a serum urate concentration of < 2 mg/dL (119 μmol/L), for the practicing rheumatologist, who usually is the consulting physician in cases of disorders of urate . We performed a narrative review through a literature search for original and review articles in the field of human hypouricemia published between January 1950 and July 2018. We divided the etiology of hypouricemia into two main categories: those associated with a decrease in urate production and those promoting the elimination of urate via the kidneys. The most common conditions associated with these categories are discussed. Furthermore, the etiology of hypouricemia may be associated with certain medications prescribed by the practicing rheumatologists, such as the following: urate-lowering drugs (allopurinol and febuxostat); recombinant uricase (pegloticase); uricosuric agents (probenecid, benzbromarone); urate transporter URAT1 inhibitor (lesinurad); angiotensin II receptor blocker (losartan); fenofibrate; high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; some NSAID; and high-dose salicylate therapy. The rheumatologist is considered an expert in the  of urate and its associated pathological conditions. Therefore, specialists must recognize hypouricemia as a biomarker of various pathological and potentially harmful conditions, highlighting the importance of conducting a deeper clinical investigation to reach a more accurate diagnosis and treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667519>Short-term dietary reduction of branched-chain amino  reduces meal-induced insulin secretion and modifies microbiome composition in type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled crossover trial.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies have shown that increased circulating branched-chain amino  (BCAAs) are associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This may result from altered energy  or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived insulin secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue expression of the mechanistic target of rapamycin was 13% lower, whereas the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was 1.7-fold higher (both P < 0.05). The fecal microbiome was enriched in Bacteroidetes but depleted of Firmicutes.Short-term dietary reduction of BCAAs decreases postprandial insulin secretion and improves white adipose tissue  and gut microbiome composition.

Accumulating data implicate a potential role of disturbed tryptophan  in IBD. Kynurenic  (KYNA), a derivative of tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, displays cytoprotective and immunomodulating properties, whereas 3-OH-KYN is a cytotoxic compound, generating free radicals.The expression of lymphocytic mRNA encoding enzymes synthesizing KYNA (KAT I-III) and serum levels of TRP and its metabolites were evaluated in 55 patients with IBD, during remission or relapse [27 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with Crohn's disease (CD)] and in 50 control individuals.The increased expression of KAT1 and KAT3 mRNA characterized the entire cohorts of patients with UC and CD, as well as relapse-remission subsets. Expression of KAT2 mRNA was enhanced in patients with UC and in patients with CD in remission. In the entire cohorts of UC or CD, TRP levels were lower, whereas KYN, KYNA and 3-OH-KYN were not altered. When analysed in subsets of patients with UC and CD (active phase-remission), KYNA level was significantly lower during remission than relapse, yet not  control. Functionally, in the whole groups of patients with UC or CD, the TRP/KYN ratio has been lower than control, whereas KYN/KYNA and KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratios were not altered. The ratio KYN/3-OH-KYN increased approximately two-fold among all patients with CD; furthermore, patients with CD with relapse, manifested a significantly higher KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratio than patients in remission.The presented data indicate that IBD is associated with an enhanced expression of genes encoding KYNA biosynthetic enzymes in lymphocytes; however, additional mechanisms appear to influence KYNA levels. Higher  conversion of serum TRP in IBD seems to be followed by the functional shift of KYN pathway towards the arm producing KYNA during exacerbation. We propose that KYNA, possibly  interaction with aryl hydrocarbon receptor or G-protein-coupled orphan receptor 35, may serve as a counter-regulatory mechanism, decreasing cytotoxicity and inflammation in IBD. Further longitudinal studies evaluating the individual dynamics of TRP and KYN pathway in patients with IBD, as well as the nature of precise mechanisms regulating KYNA synthesis, should be helpful in better understanding the processes underlying the observed changes.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655025>Novel highly potent OXE receptor antagonists with prolonged plasma lifetimes that are converted to active metabolites in vivo in monkeys.</a></h2><p>The 5-lipoxygenase product 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic  (5-oxo-ETE), acting through the OXE receptor, is a potent eosinophil chemoattractant that may be an important proinflammatory mediator in eosinophilic diseases such as asthma. We previously identified a series of indole-based OXE receptor antagonists that rapidly appear in the blood following oral administration but have limited lifetimes. The objective of this study was to increase the potency and plasma half-lives of these compounds and thereby identify the optimal candidate for future preclinical studies in monkeys, since rodents do not have an OXE receptor ortholog.We synthesized a series of substituted phenylalkyl indoles and compared their antagonist potencies, pharmacokinetics, and  to those of our earlier compounds. The potencies of some of their metabolites were also investigated.Among the compounds tested, the S-enantiomer of the m-chlorophenyl compound (S-Y048) was the most potent, with an pIC of about 10.8 for inhibition of 5-oxo-ETE-induced calcium mobilization in human neutrophils. When administered orally to cynomolgus monkeys, S-Y048 rapidly appeared in the blood and had a half-life in plasma of over 7 h, considerably longer than any of the other OXE analogs tested. A major hydroxylated metabolite, with a potency close to that of its precursor, was identified in plasma.Because of its highly potent antagonist activity and its long lifetime in vivo, S-Y048 may be a useful anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of eosinophilic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.This article is protected by copyright.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino  availability, and its  actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino  supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle , particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Ginseng berries were harvested every week during five different ripening stages of three-year-old and four-year-old ginseng. Using identified metabolites, a random forest machine learning approach was applied to obtain predictive models for the classification of cultivation age or ripening stage. Principal component analysis (PCA) score plot showed a clear separation by ripening stage, indicating that continuous  changes occurred until the fifth ripening stage. Three-year-old ginseng berries had higher levels of valine, glutamic , and tryptophan, but lower levels of lactic  and galactose than four-year-old ginseng berries at fully ripened stage.   affected by different cultivation age were involved in amino   .

The mechanisms by which maternal obesity can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal  are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational obesity. The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational obesity and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal weight and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal obesity. High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal obesity lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational obesity enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino  transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational obesity, focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.Copyright © 2019.

The identification of new effective biological markers for AMI is a prerequisite for treatment. Most proteomic studies have focused on atherosclerotic plaques, vascular cells, monocytes and platelets in the blood; however, the concentration of these factors in plasma is low, making it difficult to measure the complexity of plasma components. Moreover, some studies have examined the plasma protein of patients with acute coronary syndrome with histochemistry; however, the results are not consistent. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the differential proteins in the plasma of patients with AMI via proteomics to identify new biomarkers of AMI.In this study, immunodepletion of high-abundance plasma proteins followed by an isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyze plasma samples from 5 control individuals and 10 AMI patients.Four hundred sixty-eight proteins were identified from two samples, and 33 proteins were differentially expressed in AMI patients compared to the controls. Among the 33 proteins, 12 proteins showed a ≥1.5-fold change between AMI and control samples. These proteins included fatty  binding protein 3 (FABP3, ratio =6.36), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB ratio =4.89), adenylate kinase1 (AK1 ratio =4.16), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP ratio =3.29), creatine kinase (CK ratio =2.88), platelet factor 4 (PF4 ratio =2.62), peptidyl prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A (PPIA ratio =2.05), Cofilin-1 (CFL1 ratio =1.81), coronin1A (CORO1A ratio =1.71), protein kinase M (PKM ratio =1.63), ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1, ratio =1.67), and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI1 ratio =1.56). By contrast, there was a decrease of 19 proteins, such as adiponectin (ADIPOQ ratio =0.70), insulin-like growth factor binding protein6 (IGFBP6 ratio =0.70), Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3 ratio =0.70) and complement 4B (C4B ratio =0.68). The most over-represented term was regulation of cell proliferation in the cellular component category of Gene Ontology (GO). The top 3 biological process terms were regulation of cell proliferation, response to wounding and wound healing. These proteins included immune proteins, blood coagulation proteins, lipid  proteins, cytoskeleton proteins, energy  proteins, gene regulation proteins, myocutaneous proteins, and myocardial remodeling proteins and were highly connected with each other, which indicates that the functional network of these processes contribute to the pathophysiology of AMI.In conclusion, the present quantitative proteomic study identified novel AMI biomarker candidates and might provide fundamental information for the development of an AMI biomarker.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

To determine maternal and fetal contributions to  flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid  were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid  alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves  deficits in fetal carbohydrate  by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid  in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient  in mediating maternal-fetal  communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Weaned pigs were fed a basal diet (CON) or the basal diet supplemented with 5 × 1010 cfu kg-1 L. reuteri LR1 (LR1) for a 14 d period. Untargeted metabolomic analysis of the liver showed that LR1 up-regulated 33 metabolites and most of them were related to AA . Quantitative proteomics found that differential proteins were mainly involved in a  process in the ileal mucosa of LR1 vs. CON. Integrated metabolomic and proteomics analysis showed that the LR1's enhancement of AA  in the gut-liver axis is mediated by the up-regulated intestinal AA transporters in the pathway of protein digestion and absorption. Moreover, qPCR results confirmed that LR1 increased (p < 0.05) mRNA abundances of AA transporters (PepT1, EAAT3, rBAT, B0AT1, and b0,+AT) in the ileal mucosa compared with CON. Furthermore, western blot analysis showed that LR1 activated the mammalian target of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of S6 and 70S6K1 in the gut-liver axis of weaned pigs. Together, these data indicated that dietary supplemented LR1 enhanced AA  by up-regulating intestinal AA transporter expression and activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway in the gut-liver axis of weaned pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671345>Overexpression of lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1 Induces  Reprogramming in Trophoblast Cells and Placenta Tissue of Miscarriage.</a></h2><p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be crucial regulators in numerous human diseases. However, little is known about their effects on early recurrent miscarriage (RM). Here we aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1 on placental trophoblast cell  reprogramming, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of RM. After microarray and GEO database analyses, we found that EPB41L4A-AS1 was significantly increased in early RM placental tissue, and this increase may relate to estradiol-mediated upregulation of PGC-1α. EPB41L4A-AS1 overexpression inhibits glycolysis but increases the dependence on fatty  oxidation in mitochondrion  and suppresses the Warburg effect, which is necessary for rapid growth of the placental villus, leading to miscarriage. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that EPB41L4A-AS1 functions as a lncRNA in the regulation of VDAC1 and HIF-1α expression through enhancement of H3K4me3 levels in the promoters of VDAC1 and HIF1A-AS1, a natural antisense transcript (NAT) lncRNA of HIF-1α. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that aberrant expression of EPB41L4A-AS1 is involved in the etiology of early RM, and it may be a candidate diagnostic hallmark and a potential therapeutic target for early RM treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Supporting this notion, aKG supplementation can restore growth/survival of glutamine-deprived cells. However, pancreatic cancers are often poorly vascularized and limited in glutamine supply, in alignment with recent concerns on the significance of glutaminolysis in pancreatic cancer. Here, we show that aKG-mediated rescue of glutamine-deprived pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC) cells requires glutamate ammonia ligase (GLUL), the enzyme responsible for de novo glutamine synthesis. GLUL-deficient PDAC cells are capable of the TCA cycle but defective in aKG-coupled glutamine biosynthesis and subsequent nitrogen anabolic processes. Importantly, GLUL expression is elevated in pancreatic cancer patient samples and in mouse PDAC models. GLUL ablation suppresses the development of Kras-driven murine PDAC. Therefore, GLUL-mediated glutamine biosynthesis couples the TCA cycle with nitrogen anabolism and plays a critical role in PDAC.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We studied sialidase activity in several E. tarda strains and found that the pathogenic strains exhibited higher sialidase activity and greater up-regulation of the NanA mRNA level than non-pathogenic strain. Pathogenic strains also showed higher rates of infection in GAKS cells, and the infection was drastically suppressed by sialidase inhibitor. Additionally, NanA gene over-expression significantly increased infection and treatment of E. tarda with free sialic  enhanced the rate of infection in GAKS cells. Sialic  treatment enhanced mRNA levels of two N-acetylneuraminate lyases and one N-acetylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase. E. tarda uses sialic  as a carbon source for growth via N-acetylneuraminate lyases. The strains with high N-acetylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase level showed greater sialylation of the lipopolysaccharides and glycoproteins. Our study establishes the significance of desialylation by E. tarda sialidase in the regulation of its invasiveness.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652359>Impacts of sex and exposure duration on gene expression in zebrafish following perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure.</a></h2><p>Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a member of the anthropogenic class of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs), and is one of the most frequently detected PFAS in water, humans, mammals, and fish around the world. The zebrafish (Danio rerio), is a small freshwater fish considered an appropriate vertebrate model for investigating the toxicity of compounds. Previous investigations showed tissue-specific bioaccumulation and alterations in the expression of fatty  binding proteins (fabps) in male and female zebrafish, potentially due to interactions between PFAS and fatty  transporters. In addition, a number of neurological impacts have been reported as a result of human and animal exposure to PFAS. Therefore, this comprehensive study was designed to investigate whether PFOS exposure affects the expression of genes associated with fatty   (fabp1a, fabp2, and fabp10a) in zebrafish liver, intestine, heart, and ovary and genes involved in the nervous system (ChAT, ngf, bdnf, AChE, and hdac6) in brain and muscle. Results indicate alterations in expression of genes associated with fatty   and neural function that vary with both exposure concentration and sex. Additionally, our findings highlight that the expression of these genes differ according to exposure duration. Our results extend the knowledge base on PFOS effects to other tissues less often studied than the liver. The findings of this investigation provide a basis for future studies on the potential risks of PFOS as one of the most abundant PFAS in the environment. This article is protected by copyright.

Planktonically grown  is known to prioritize the consumption of organic  including lactic  over catabolism of glucose using a CCR strategy termed "reverse diauxie."  is an opportunistic pathogen with well-documented biofilm phenotypes that are distinct from its planktonic phenotypes. Reverse diauxie has been described in planktonic cultures, but it has not been documented explicitly in  biofilms. Here a combination of exometabolomics and label-free proteomics was used to analyze planktonic and biofilm phenotypes for reverse diauxie.  biofilm cultures preferentially consumed lactic  over glucose, and in addition, the cultures catabolized the substrates completely and did not exhibit the acetate secreting "overflow"  that is typical of many model microorganisms. The biofilm phenotype was enabled by changes in protein abundances, including lactate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, GTP cyclohydrolase, L-ornithine N(5)-monooxygenase, and superoxide dismutase. These results are noteworthy because reverse diauxie-mediated catabolism of organic  necessitates a terminal electron acceptor like O, which is typically in low supply in biofilms due to diffusion limitation. Label-free proteomics identified dozens of proteins associated with biofilm formation including 16 that have not been previously reported, highlighting both the advantages of the methodology utilized here and the complexity of the proteomic adaptation for  biofilms. Documenting the reverse diauxic phenotype in  biofilms is foundational for understanding cellular nutrient and energy fluxes, which ultimately control growth and virulence.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658664>Association Between Fatty  Profile and Cerebral Blood Flow: An Exploratory fNIRS Study on Children with and without ADHD.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) biostatus has been proposed as possible attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis biomarker. The present exploratory study aimed to investigate the association between PUFAs biostatus and cerebral cortex  measured by functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) in a sample of children with and without ADHD. 24 children with ADHD and 22 typically developing (TD) peers, aged 8-14, were recruited. Linoleic, arachidonic, docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic  levels were evaluated in whole blood. All children underwent fNIRS while performing an n-back working memory task. Between groups comparisons revealed lower levels of arachidonic  in children with ADHD and stronger NIRS signal in TD participants, especially when completing more difficult tasks. Correlations conducted between fNIRS activation and PUFA biostatus revealed several associations between hemodynamic changes in the frontoparietal regions and fatty  profile across participants. This result was also confirmed by the multiple hierarchical regression analyses that remarked an inverse effect of eicosapentaenoic  levels on oxyhemoglobin values in right frontoparietal region. Such preliminary findings, if confirmed, would suggest that PUFAs could play a role in atypical neurodevelopment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670467>Cycles, Waves, and Pulses: Retinoic  and the Organization of Spermatogenesis.</a></h2><p>Spermatogenesis in mammals is organized in a manner that maximizes sperm production. The central aspect of this organization is the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium that is characterized by an asynchronous repeating series of germ cell associations. These cell associations are the result of a fixed point of entry into the cycle at regular short time intervals and the longer time required for cells to fully differentiate and exit the cycle.This review will examine the current information on the action and  of retinoic  in the testis, the interaction of retinoic  (RA) with the cycle and the spermatogenic wave, and the mechanisms that can lead to synchronous spermatogenesis. Finally, the unique applications of synchronous spermatogenesis to the study of the cycle and the mass isolation of specific germ cell populations are described.Retinoic   and spermatogonial differentiation have been examined by gene deletions, immunocytochemistry, chemical inhibitors, and mass spectrometry.Both the Sertoli cells and the germ cells have the capacity to synthesize retinoic  from retinol and in the mouse the entry into the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium and the subsequent conversion of undifferentiated spermatogonia into differentiating spermatogonia is governed by a peak of RA synthesis occurring at stages VIII-IX of the cycle. Normal asynchronous spermatogenesis can be modified by altering RA levels and as a result the entire testis will consist of a few closely related stages of the cycle.© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670473>Bain type of X-linked syndromic mental retardation in a male with a pathogenic variant in HNRNPH2.</a></h2><p>Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are RNA binding proteins, which aid in maturation, stabilization, and transport of mRNA.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) primarily regulates the expression of target genes involved in energy control as well as lipid and glucose . Although the pivotal roles of these receptors on female fertility have been reported, there are limited studies addressing PPARs role(s) in the male. This study was designed to determine and compare  and  mRNA expression in sperm cells of normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic men.

We have also assessed in a sub-group of seven normozoospermic and eight asthenozoospermic samples, PPARγ protein levels by western blotting. Relative expression of PPARγ mRNA in normozoospermic men was found to be significantly higher (P = 0.004) than in asthenozoospermic men while  and  relative expression was similar in the two groups. Likewise,  showed a positive correlation with motility (r = 0.34; P < 0.05), sperm concentration (r = 0.33) and the percentage of progressive motile spermatozoa (r = 0.31).

However, lower productivity and high saline medium seriously hinder its wide applications.The entire ectoine , including  for ectoine synthesis and catabolism, was identified in the genome of an ectoine-excreting strain Halomonas hydrothermalis Y2. By in-frame deletion of genes encoding ectoine hydroxylase (EctD) and (or) ectoine hydrolase (DoeA) that responsible for ectoine catabolism, the  for ectoine utilization were disrupted and resulted in an obviously enhanced productivity. Using an optimized medium containing 100 g L NaCl in a 500-mL flask, the double mutant of Y2/ΔectD/ΔdoeA synthesized 3.13 g L ectoine after 30 h cultivation. This is much higher than that of the wild type strain (1.91 g L), and also exceeds the production of Y2/ΔectD (2.21 g L). The remarkably enhanced accumulation of ectoine by Y2/ΔectD/ΔdoeA implied a critical function of Doe pathway in the ectoine catabolism. Furthermore, to reduce the salinity of fermentation medium and overcome the wastewater treatment difficulty, mutants that lacking key Na/H antiporter, Mrp and (or) NhaD2, were constructed based on strain Y2/ΔectD/ΔdoeA. As a result, the Mrp-deficient strain could synthesize equal amount of ectoine (around 7 g L or 500 mg (g DCW) ) in the medium containing lower concentration of NaCl. During a fed-batch fermentation process with 60 g L NaCl stress, a maximum 10.5 g L ectoine was accumulated by the Mrp-deficient strain, with a specific production of 765 mg (g DCW) and a yield of 0.21 g g monosodium glutamate.The remarkably enhanced production of ectoine by Y2/ΔectD/ΔdoeA implied the critical function of Doe pathway in the ectoine catabolism.

Mitochondrial proteins have been discovered to modulate these signaling pathway , and multiple biological behaviors to adapt to various internal environments or signaling events of human pathogenesis. Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction that alters the bioenergetic and biosynthetic state might contribute to multiple diseases, including cell transformation and tumor. Multiomics studies have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cell cycle dysregulation signaling  operate in human pituitary adenomas, which suggest mitochondria play critical roles in pituitary adenomas. Some drugs targeting mitochondria are found as a therapeutic strategy for pituitary adenomas, including melatonin, melatonin inhibitors, temozolomide, pyrimethamine, 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic , gossypol acetate, Yougui pill, T-2 toxin, grifolic , cyclosporine A, dopamine agonists, and paeoniflorin.

Their varied functions are based on the phosphorylation pattern of their inositol ring, which can be recognized by selective binding domains in their effector proteins and be modified by a series of specific PIPn kinases and phosphatases, which control their interconversion in a spatial and temporal manner. Yet, a unique feature of PIPns remains largely unexplored: their unusually uniform acyl chain composition. Indeed, while most phospholipids present a range of molecular species comprising acyl chains of diverse length and saturation, PIPns in several organisms and tissues show the predominance of a single hydrophobic backbone, which in mammals is composed of arachidonoyl and stearoyl chains. Despite evolution having favoured this specific PIPn configuration, little is known regarding the mechanisms and functions behind it. In this review, we explore the   that could control the acyl chain composition of PIPns as well as the potential roles of this selective enrichment. While our understanding of this phenomenon has been constrained largely by the technical limitations in the methods traditionally employed in the PIPn field, we believe that the latest developments in PIPn analysis should shed light onto this old question.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654895>Protective properties of milk sphingomyelin against dysfunctional lipid , gut dysbiosis, and inflammation.</a></h2><p>The identification of natural bioactive compounds aimed at promoting optimal gut health and improving lipid  is paramount in the prevention of chronic disease. In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid , gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty  in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut microbiota in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid , gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller. More research is warranted to clearly define how dietary milk SM influences lipid , gut microbiota, and inflammation in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies indicated an emerging role of these eicosanoids in  diseases and the EET signaling pathway was shown to be involved in hepatic insulin sensitivity. However, compared to vascular tissues, there is only limited knowledge about the underlying signaling  in the liver. Therefore, we employed an LC-MS/MS-based time-resolved phosphoproteomics approach to characterize 11,12-EET-mediated signaling events in the liver cell line Hepa 1-6. 11,12-EET treatment resulted in the time-dependent regulation of phosphopeptides involved in processes as yet unknown to be affected by EETs, including RNA processing, splicing and translation regulation. Pathway analysis combined with western blot-based validation revealed enhanced AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signaling as demonstrated by increased acute phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and p70S6K (Thr389). In addition, 11,12-EET treatment led to differential regulation of phosphopeptides including important mediators of the DNA damage response and we observed a prolonged induction of the etoposide-induced DNA damage marker γH2AX in response to 11,12-EET. In summary, our findings extend current knowledge of 11,12-EET signaling events and emphasize the importance of the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway in hepatic 11,12-EET signaling.

Upon 7-day separate exposure to the four target compounds at 1 µmol/L, significant hepatic steatosis in exposed larvae was evidenced by pathological micro/macro vacuolation, which was presumably attributed to the excess accumulation of lipid, especially the overloaded triglyceride (TG) level. Disruption on gene transcription was subjected to a structure-dependent manner. In general, PFOS, Cl-PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA of the identical carbon chain length (i.e. C8), despite with different substituents, displayed a similar activation mode and comparable disruptive potency on lipid  responsive genes, which particularly promoted fatty  synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acacb) and β-oxidation (cytochrome P450 enzymes-1A, cyp1a; peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1, acox1; and acyl-CoA dehy-drogenase, acadm). However, 8:2 Cl-PFESA with a prolonged carbon chain length (i.e. C10), preferentially disturbed fatty  exportation (apolipoprotein-B100, apob) and triggered a different modulation pattern on fatty  β-oxidation against the other three compounds. Molecular docking analysis indicated that 8:2 Cl-PFESA exhibited considerably higher peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) antagonism than others, corresponding to its unique suppression effect on fatty  β-oxidation responsive genes. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study reporting hepatotoxicity of Cl-PFOS and Cl-PFESAs to aquatic organisms.

Lack of a good mammalian model has impeded studies of pathogenesis and development of rational therapeutics. We took a new approach to investigating an existing mouse mutant of Pank2 and found that isolating the disease-vulnerable brain revealed regional perturbations in CoA , iron homeostasis, and dopamine  and functional defects in complex I and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Feeding mice a CoA pathway intermediate, 4'-phosphopantetheine, normalized levels of the CoA-, iron-, and dopamine-related biomarkers as well as activities of mitochondrial enzymes. Human cell changes also were recovered by 4'-phosphopantetheine. We can mechanistically link a defect in CoA  to these secondary effects via the activation of mitochondrial acyl carrier protein, which is essential to oxidative phosphorylation, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, and mitochondrial fatty  synthesis. We demonstrate the fidelity of our model in recapitulating features of the human disease.

Alteration in energy  has been suggested to contribute to radiation-induced heart pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction being a hallmark of this disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the regulatory role of acetylation in heart mitochondria in the long-term response to chronic radiation. ApoE-deficient C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to low-dose-rate (20 mGy/day) gamma radiation for 300 days, resulting in a cumulative total body dose of 6.0 Gy. Heart mitochondria were isolated and analyzed using quantitative proteomics. Radiation-induced proteome and acetylome alterations were further validated using immunoblotting, enzyme activity assays, and ELISA. In total, 71 proteins showed peptides with a changed acetylation status following irradiation. The great majority (94%) of the hyperacetylated proteins were involved in the TCA cycle, fatty  oxidation, oxidative stress response and sirtuin pathway. The elevated acetylation patterns coincided with reduced activity of mitochondrial sirtuins, increased the level of Acetyl-CoA, and were accompanied by inactivation of major cardiac  regulators PGC-1 alpha and PPAR alpha. These observations suggest that the changes in mitochondrial acetylation after irradiation is associated with impairment of heart .

We hypothesized that total fermentation but not the source (type) of FM would be the main factor in determining cellular /molecular outcomes in the healthy colon epithelia. The main aim of this study was to elucidate the role of two different sources of FM, fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and wheat bran (WB), on the expression of genes involved in short chain fatty  (SCFA) transport, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, cell proliferation and oncogenesis in colon epithelia of healthy rats. Male Fischer 344 rats (n = 10/group) were fed AIN-93G control (0% FM) or experimental diets containing WB (~1%, 2%, or 5% FM) or FOS (~2%, 5%, or 8% FM). Rats were killed after 6 weeks and the colon mucosa was assessed for the expression of target genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. By comparison to the control, dose-related changes of mRNA levels were found in rats fed FOS-based diets, including: (a) upregulation of three SCFA transporters (Smct2, Mct1 and Mct4) but downregulation of Mct2, (b) upregulation of Gpr109a and downregulation of Gpr120, Gpr43, Gprc5a, Rgs2 and Rgs16, (c) upregulation of apoptosis-related genes including Bcl2, Bcl2-like 1, Bak1, Caspase 3, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9, (d) downregulation of the oncogenes and metastasis genes Ros1, Fos, Cd44, Fn1 and Plau, and (e) downregulation of several genes involved in cellular proliferation including Hbegf, Hoxb13, Cgref1, Wfdc1, Tgm3, Fgf7, Nov and Lumican. In contrast, rats fed WB-based diets resulted in dose-related upregulation of mRNA levels of Smct2, Rgs16, Gprc5a, Gpr109a, Bcl2-like 1, Caspase 8, and Fos. Additionally, different gene expression responses were observed in rats fed FOS and WB at 2% and 5% FM. Over all, these gene changes elicited by FOS and WB were independent of the expression of the tumor suppressor Tp53. These results suggest that fermentation alone is not the sole determinant of gene responses in the healthy rat colon.Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C),  deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic  (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated , neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on , viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue  and inflammation, liver steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658881>Anti-hyperlipidemic effects of Campomanesia xanthocarpa aqueous extract and its modulation on oxidative stress and genomic instability in Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>The use of natural products from herbs may be a therapeutic option in dyslipidemia treatment.  (Mart.) O. Berg (Myrtaceae) leaves have been used to decrease cholesterol levels. However, studies to determine activities of this plant on triglycerides  have received little attention. The aim of this study was to examine anti-hyperlipidemic effects of a  aqueous leaf extract (CxAE) and assess protective actions against oxidative stress and DNA damage. The tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia model was used in Wistar rats. Rats were treated orally with CxAE either 250 or 500 mg/kg/day for 7 days prior to tyloxapol administration. Biochemical parameters, oxidative stress levels, and genomic instability were assessed in several tissues. CxAE decreased cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum and hepatic and renal DNA damage in tyloxapol-treated rats. There was no marked effect on the micronucleus frequency in bone marrow. The extract increased catalase activity and decreased glutathione S-transferase activity in kidney tissue. CxAE showed anti-hyperlipidemic effects, improved oxidative parameters, and protected DNA against damage induced by tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia, suggesting  leaves may be useful in preventing dyslipidemias.

Human MD2, an indispensable accessory protein in TLR4 signaling pathway, specifically recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS), thereby leading to the activation of TLR4 signaling pathway to produce many effectors that participate in inflammatory and immune responses against Gram-negative bacteria. Toll and immune deficiency (IMD)  are first characterized in Drosophila and are reportedly present in crustaceans, but the recognition and activation mechanism of these signaling  in crustaceans remains unclear. In the present study, a novel ML protein was characterized in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) and designated as SpMD2. The complete SpMD2 cDNA sequence is 1114 bp long with a 465 bp open reading frame; it encodes a protein that contains 154 amino  (aa). In the deduced protein, a signal peptide (1-21 aa residues) and a ML domain (43-151 aa residues) were predicted. SpMD2 shared a similar three-dimensional structure and a close evolutionary relationship with human MD2. SpMD2 was highly expressed in gills, hemocytes, intestine, and hepatopancreas and was upregulated in gills and hemocytes after challenges with bacteria, thereby suggesting its involvement in antibacterial defense. Western blot assay showed that SpMD2 possesses strong binding activities to different bacteria and two fungi. ELISA demonstrated that SpMD2 exhibits binding abilities to LPS, lipid A, peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipoteichoic  (LTA). Its binding ability to LPS and lipid A were stronger than to PGN or LTA, implying that SpMD2 was an important LPS-binding protein in mud crab. Bacterial clearance assay revealed that the pre-incubation of Vibrio parahemolyticus with SpMD2 facilitates bacterial clearance in vivo and that knockdown of SpMD2 dramatically suppresses the bacterial clearance and decreases the expression of several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Furthermore, SpMD2 overexpression could enhance the promoter activity of SpALF2. These results revealed that SpMD2 affects bacterial clearance by regulating AMPs. Thus, by binding to LPS and by regulating AMPs, SpMD2 may function as a potential receptor, which is involved in the recognition and activation of a certain immune signaling pathway against Gram-negative bacteria. This study provides new insights into the diverse functions of ML proteins and into the antibacterial mechanisms of crustaceans.Copyright © 2019.

Also, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including cecropins, histatins, defensins, and cathelicidins, have recently become an antimicrobial research hotspot for their broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activities. In addition, defensins play important roles in plant growth, development, and physiological , and demonstrate tissue specificity and regulation in response to pathogen attack or abiotic stress. In this study, we performed molecular cloning, characterization, expression profiling, and functional analysis of a defensin from Populus trichocarpa. The PtDef protein was highly expressed in the prokaryotic Escherichia coli system as a fusion protein (TrxA-PtDef). The purified protein exhibited strong antibacterial and antifungal functions. We then applied PtDef to rooting culture medium as an alternative exogenous additive to cefotaxime. PtDef expression levels increased significantly following both biotic and abiotic treatment. The degree of leaf damage observed in wild-type (WT) and transgenic poplars indicates that transgenic poplars that overexpress the PtDef gene gain enhanced disease resistance to Septotis populiperda. To further study the salicylic  (SA) and jasmonic  (JA) signal transduction , SA- and JA-related and pathogenesis-related genes were analyzed using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; there were significant differences in these  between transgenic and WT poplars. The defensin from Populus trichocarpa showed significant activity of anti-bacteria and anti-fungi. According to the results of qRT-PCR and physiological relevant indicators, the applied PtDef to rooting culture medium was chosen as an alternative exogenous additive to cefotaxime.

Exogenous administration of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs have also been implicated in the modulation of cardiovascular functions. This brief review summarizes the role of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in vascular relaxation through the modulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). The effects of taurine on vascular health are controversial. However, in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors, it has been proposed that taurine can increase vascular NO levels by increasing eNOS expression, eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177, NO bioavailability, the level of antioxidative defense, and the l-arginine/NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio. The taurine-conjugated BA-mediated activation of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), G protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5) and/or muscarinic 3 receptor (M3) was also reported to increase vascular NO production. FXR activation increases eNOS expression and may reduce ADMA formation, while TGR5 increases mobilization of Ca and phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt in endothelial cells. Furthermore, taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs might regulate NO synthesis and activity by enhancing HS generation. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in reversing the endothelial dysfunction associated with diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, obesity, malnutrition, and smoking. In addition, taurine-conjugated BAs have emerged as a potential treatment for portal hypertension. Despite these favorable findings, there is a need to further explore the mechanisms and signaling  underlying the endothelial effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs. Here, we summarize the main findings regarding the effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs on the endothelial dysfunction associated with altered NO  in cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

In , there are 14 members of the ABA receptor family, which are key positive regulators involved in ABA signaling. Besides reduced drought stress tolerance, the quadruple and sextuple mutants ( (1124) and  (112458) show abnormal growth phenotypes, such as decreases in yield and height, under non-stress conditions. However, it remains unknown whether ABA receptors mediate ABA signaling to regulate plant growth and development. Here, we showed the primary metabolite profiles of 1124, 112458 and wild-type (WT) plants grown under normal conditions. The  changes were significantly different between ABA receptor mutants and WT. Guanosine, for the biosynthesis of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP), is an important second messenger that acts to regulate the level of ABA. In addition, other amino  were increased in the 112458 mutant, including proline.

In response to primary  alteration, plants can produce also small molecules such as methylglyoxal (MG), a cytotoxic aldehyde. MG is mostly detoxified by the combined actions of the enzymes glyoxalase I (GLYI) and glyoxalase II (GLYII) that make up the glyoxalase system. Recently, by a genome-wide association study performed in Arabidopsis, we identified GLYI4 as a novel player in the crosstalk between jasmonate (JA) and salicylic  (SA) hormone . Here, we investigated the impact of  knock-down on MG scavenging and on JA pathway. In  mutant plants, we observed a general stress phenotype, characterized by compromised MG scavenging, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), stomatal closure, and reduced fitness. Accumulation of MG in  plants led to lower efficiency of the JA pathway, as highlighted by the increased susceptibility of the plants to the pathogenic fungus . Moreover, MG accumulation brought about a localization of GLYI4 to the plasma membrane, while MeJA stimulus induced a translocation of the protein into the cytoplasmic compartment. Collectively, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that GLYI4 is a hub in the MG and JA .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652968>Molecular Cloning and Exploration of the Biochemical and Functional Analysis of Recombinant Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase from  PAL5.</a></h2><p> PAL5 (GDI) is an endophytic bacterium with potential biotechnological applications in industry and agronomy. The recent description of its complete genome and its principal  enzymes suggests that glucose  is accomplished through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP); however, the enzymes participating in this pathway have not yet been characterized in detail. The objective of the present work was to clone, purify, and biochemically and physicochemically characterize glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) from GDI. The gene was cloned and expressed as a tagged protein in .  to be purified by affinity chromatography. The native state of the G6PD protein in the solution was found to be a tetramer with optimal activity at pH 8.8 and a temperature between 37 and 50 °C. The apparent  values for G6P and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) were 63 and 7.2 μM, respectively.

This study aims to establish  factors in obesity-related IDD independent of mechanical loading. In clinical study, we retrospectively reviewed 128 volunteers (73 males, 55 females, aged 29-88 years) and compared their grades of disk degeneration with obesity-related factors such as body weight, BMI, and serum lipid levels. Clinically, the IDD group showed increased age, BMI and serum triglyceride. Triglyceride was a significant risk factor for IDD even after correction for BMI and age (P = 0.007). In obesity animal model, rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) in order to study its effects on disk  and apoptosis. HFD rats had significantly higher serum levels of lipids, including triglyceride and non-esterified fatty , and showed significantly decreased markers of anabolism, increased catabolism and apoptosis in disk. Finally, rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were stimulated  with a fatty  (palmitic , PA) to gauge its effects on cell  and apoptosis. Cell culture studies showed that NP cells exposed to PA showed increased apoptosis for activation of caspase 3, 7, 9, and PARP, which was primarily via the MAPK signal pathway, especially ERK pathway. In conclusion, hypertriglyceridemia can lead to IDD, independently of age and BMI. Hypertriglyceridemia appears to mediate disk cell apoptosis and matrix catabolism primarily via the ERK pathway.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Chen, Huang, Wang, Shan, Liu, Chen, Li, Fan and Zhao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675464>Molybdate Toxicity in Chinese Cabbage is not the direct Consequence of Changes in Sulfur .</a></h2><p>In polluted areas, plants may be exposed to supra-optimal levels of the micronutrient molybdenum. The physiological basis of molybdenum phytotoxicity is poorly understood. Plants take up molybdenum as molybdate, which is a structural analogue of sulfate. Therefore, it is presumed that elevated molybdate concentrations may hamper the uptake and subsequent  of sulfate, which may induce sulfur deficiency. In the current research, Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis) seedlings were exposed to 50, 100, 150 and 200 μM Na MoO for nine days. Leaf chlorosis and a decreased plant growth occurred at concentrations ≥ 100 μM. Root growth was more affected than shoot growth. At ≥ 100 μM Na MoO , the sulfate uptake rate and capacity were increased, though only when expressed on a root fresh weight basis. When expressed on a whole plant fresh weight basis, which corrects for the impact of molybdate on the shoot-to-root ratio, the sulfate uptake rate and capacity remained unaffected. Molybdate concentrations ≥ 100 μM altered the mineral nutrient composition of plant tissues, although the levels of sulfur metabolites (sulfate, water-soluble non-protein thiols and total sulfur) were not altered. Moreover, the levels of nitrogen metabolites (nitrate, amino , proteins and total nitrogen), which are generally strongly affected by sulfate deprivation, were not affected. The root water-soluble non-protein thiol content was increased and the tissue nitrate levels decreased, only at 200 μM Na MoO . Evidently, molybdenum toxicity in Chinese cabbage was not due to the direct interference of molybdate with the uptake and subsequent  of sulfate.© 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665663>Differential protein analysis of Heracleum moellendorffii Hance seeds during stratification.</a></h2><p>Heracleum moellendorffii Hance is a medicinal vegetable species, and the seed dormancy of this species has caused many agricultural problems. One stratification technique involves alternating layers of seeds and substrate to allow post-ripening of dormant seeds under appropriate environmental conditions and to release dormancy. Non-stratified seeds (NS), cotyledon-stage-embryo seeds (CS) and germinated seeds (GS) represent key stages of H. moellendorffii seeds during stratification. To better understand the breaking of dormancy caused by stratification, tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry (MS)/MS was used to detect proteins among NS, CS and GS. A total of 876 proteins were identified, which were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. The results showed that carbohydrate  processes, responses to stress and ribosome biogenesis were the main biological processes. The changes in protein accumulation were validated by qRT-PCR. The results showed that starch, sucrose, pyruvate and fatty   played significant roles and that the contents of stored substances were gradually degraded during stratification.

In recent years, ITC has emerged as a powerful tool to characterise enzyme kinetics. In this study, we have adapted a single-injection method (SIM) to study the kinetics of human soluble epoxide hydrolase (hsEH), an enzyme involved in cardiovascular homeostasis, hypertension, nociception and insulin sensitivity through the  of epoxy-fatty  (EpFAs). In the SIM method, the rate of reaction is determined by monitoring the thermal power while the substrate is being depleted, overcoming the need for synthetic substrates, and reducing postreaction processing. Our results show that ITC enables the detailed, rapid and reproducible characterisation of the hsEH-mediated hydrolysis of several natural EpFA substrates. Furthermore, we have applied a variant of the single-injection ITC method for the detailed description of enzyme inhibition, proving the power of this approach in the rapid screening and discovery of new hsEH inhibitors using the enzyme's physiological substrates. The methods described herein will enable further studies on EpFAs  and biology, as well as drug discovery investigations to identify and characterise hsEH inhibitors.

Moreover, innovative therapeutic strategies are needed for the treatment of neurological outcomes that are usually resistant to conventional treatments. Our previous findings suggest a link between SIRT1, cellular stress and RNA binding proteins (RBP) mislocalization in the pathological mechanisms triggered by impaired vitamin B12 .The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of the pharmacological activation of SIRT1 using SRT1720 on the molecular mechanisms triggered by impaired methionine synthase activity. Experiments were performed in vitro with fibroblasts from patients with the cblG and cblC inherited defects of vitamin B12  and in vivo with an original transgenic mouse model of methionine synthase deficiency specific to neuronal cells. Subcellular localization of the RBPs HuR, HnRNPA1, RBM10, SRSF1 and Y14 was investigated by immunostaining and confocal microscopy in patient fibroblasts. RBPs methylation and phosphorylation were studied by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. Cognitive performance of the transgenic mice treated with SRT1720 was measured with an aquatic maze.Patient fibroblasts with cblC and cblG defects of vitamin B12  presented with endoplasmic reticulum stress, altered methylation, phosphorylation and subcellular localization of HuR, HnRNPA1 and RBM10, global mRNA mislocalization and increased HnRNPA1-dependent skipping of IRF3 exons. Incubation of fibroblasts with cobalamin, S-adenosyl methionine and okadaic  rescued the localization of the RBPs and mRNA. The SIRT1 activating compound SRT1720 inhibited ER stress and rescued RBP and mRNA mislocalization and IRF3 splicing. Treatment with this SIRT1 agonist prevented all these hallmarks in patient fibroblasts but it also improved the deficient hippocampo-dependent learning ability of methionine synthase conditional knock-out mice.By unraveling the molecular mechanisms triggered by inborn errors of cbl  associating ER stress, RBP mislocalization and mRNA trafficking, our study opens novel therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of inborn errors of vitamin B12 .Copyright © 2019.

Although previous studies have reported the negative effects of AgNMs on various microorganisms, little is known about the response of bacteria under the exposure of AgNMs at the cellular level. Here, we report the multiple responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (PAO1) under the exposure of two types of AgNMs, including spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and fibrous silver nanorods (AgNRs), by physiological experiments, microscopy, synchrotron-based X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), flow cytometry and genome-wide RNA sequencing. Our results demonstrated that the exposure to both types of AgNMs could inhibit the growth of PAO1, accompanied by the overproduction of oxidative stress and inducing cell membrane damage. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the roughened cell membrane under both AgNMs treatment. In addition, both AgNMs repressed the expression of quorum sensing and metal efflux-related genes in PAO1, but stimulated denitrification, glycerol and amino  metabolisms, SOS response and pyocin overproduction of PAO1. Compared to AgNRs, AgNPs exposure showed a much lower threshold concentration to trigger the inhibitory effect and induced greater transcriptional responses of PAO1. This study suggested that AgNMs could cause multiple effects on the proliferation, , virulence and pathogenesis of PAO1, which might further affect the corresponding environmental microbial communities.

The role of this  pathway in macrophage response and function is unknown. We show that the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is induced in macrophages infected with pathogenic bacteria through signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/MTOR and the transcription factor SP1. This results in the synthesis of cystathionine, which facilitates the survival of pathogens within myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of CTH leads to defective macrophage activation by (i) dysregulation of polyamine  by depletion of -adenosylmethionine, resulting in immunosuppressive putrescine accumulation and inhibition of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and (ii) increased histone H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 di/trimethylation, which is associated with gene expression silencing. Thus, CTH is a pivotal enzyme of the innate immune response that disrupts host defense. The induction of the reverse transsulfuration pathway by bacterial pathogens can be considered an unrecognized mechanism for immune escape. Macrophages are professional immune cells that ingest and kill microbes. In this study, we show that different pathogenic bacteria induce the expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) in macrophages. This enzyme is involved in a  pathway called the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which leads to the production of numerous metabolites, including cystathionine. Phagocytized bacteria use cystathionine to better survive in macrophages. In addition, the induction of CTH results in dysregulation of the  of polyamines, which in turn dampens the proinflammatory response of macrophages.

In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the liver of NAFLD/NASH patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly, NASH therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing fatty  β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for NASH treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of   and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain.

CSF levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and interferon (IFN)-γ were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and results were statistically compared between PD patients and controls.Median CSF levels of KYN and 3-HK were 49.0 nM and 4.25 nM in PD and 30.5 nM and 1.55 nM in controls, respectively, showing significantly higher levels in PD (p < 0.05). CSF levels of measured cytokines showed that TNF-α and IL-1β were significantly higher in PD patients than in controls. No positive correlation between 3-HK and TNF-α was seen in PD.Dysfunction of the KYN pathway may induce oxidative stress in the CNS in PD, and may also induce cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation. Functional amelioration of the KYN pathway may facilitate modification of neurodegenerative processes in PD.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this systematic review is to compare the effects of mesh coatings reducing the tissue-to-mesh adhesion in animal studies.Pubmed and Embase were systematically searched. Animal experiments comparing intraperitoneally placed meshes with coatings were eligible for inclusion. Only studies with comparable follow-up, measurements, and species were included for data pooling and subsequent meta-analysis.A total of 131 articles met inclusion criteria, with four studies integrated into one comparison and five studies integrated into another comparison. Compared to uncoated polypropylene (PP) mesh, PP mesh coated with hyaluronic /carboxymethyl cellulose (HA/CMC) showed significantly reduced adhesion formation at follow-up of 4 weeks measured with adhesion score of extent (random effects model, mean difference,-  0.96, 95% CI - 1.32 to - 0.61, P < 0.001, I = 23%; fixed effects model, mean difference,- 0.94, 95% CI - 1.25 to - 0.63, P < 0.001, I = 23%). Compared to PP mesh, polyester mesh coated with collagen (PC mesh) showed no significant difference at follow-up of 4 weeks regarding percentage of adhesion-area on a mesh, using random effects model (mean difference - 11.69, 95% CI - 44.14 to 20.76, P = 0.48, I = 92%). However, this result differed using fixed effects model (mean difference - 25.55, 95% CI - 33.70 to - 7.40, P < 0.001, I = 92%).HA/CMC coating reduces adhesion formation to PP mesh effectively at a follow-up of 4 weeks, while the anti-adhesive properties of PC mesh are inclusive comparing all study data.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664805>The Role of Lipids in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with few treatment options and a 70% recurrence rate. This trend is driven largely by the recent surge in incidence of  syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Given the central role of the liver in lipid homeostasis, altered hepatic lipid  has been identified as a contributing factor to hepatocellular carcinoma. Neoplastic cells are highly dependent on lipid  as a source of energy and to support rapid cell division, and fatty  derivatives play key roles in cell signaling. Aberrant expression of liver fatty –binding protein and changes in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated triacylglycerols have been shown to be associated with disease severity and subtype. This chapter focuses on  reprogramming and dysregulation of lipid  as hallmarks of hepatocellular carcinoma.Copyright: The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670119>Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal antibacterial mechanism of astringent persimmon tannin against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from pork.</a></h2><p>Persimmon tannin (PT) exhibits antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from retail pork. The involved molecular mechanisms were investigated for the first time using transcriptome and metabolome in this study. Results showed that subinhibitory concentration of PT (0.5 mg/ml) induced significant changes in MRSA at both transcriptional and  levels, as 370 genes and 19 metabolites were differentially expressed. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the varying genes and metabolites were mainly involved in  of membrane transport, amino , carbohydrate, and energy . The highlighted changes were those related to osmotic regulation, intracellular pH regulation, amino  synthesis and , glycolysis, TCA cycle and iron , suggesting the multifaceted effects including cell membrane damage, amino  limitation, energy  disorder and iron deprivation induced by PT. The results provided insight into the anti-MRSA mechanism of PT, which is useful for PT's development and application in food safety.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, for the production of valuable secondary metabolites by genetic engineering, the species is considered a clean host, enabling easy purification from cultured cells. A. oryzae has been evaluated for secondary metabolite production utilizing strong constitutive promoters of genes responsible for primary . However, secondary metabolites are typically produced by residual nutrition after microbial cells grow to the stationary phase and primary  slows. We focused on a promoter of the secondary  gene kojA, a component of the kojic  biosynthetic gene cluster, for the production of other secondary metabolites by A. oryzae.A kojA disruptant that does not produce kojic  was utilized as a host strain for production. Using this host strain, a mutant that expressed a polyketide synthase gene involved in polyketide secondary metabolite production under the kojA gene promoter was constructed. Then, polyketide production and polyketide synthase gene expression were observed every 24 h in liquid culture. From days 0 to 10 of culture, the polyketide was continuously produced, and the synthase gene expression was maintained. Therefore, the kojA promoter was activated, and it enabled the continuous production of polyketide for 10 days.The combined use of the kojA gene promoter and a kojA disruptant proved useful for the continuous production of a polyketide secondary metabolite in A. oryzae. These findings suggest that this combination can be applied to other secondary metabolites for long-term production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666195>Circulating amino  signature in older people with Parkinson's disease: A  complement to the EXosomes in PArkiNson Disease (EXPAND) study.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in old age. Neurotoxicity of dopaminergic neurons triggered by aggregation of misfolded α-synuclein is a major pathogenic trait of PD. However, growing evidence indicates that peripheral processes, including  changes, may precede and contribute to neurodegeneration. The present study was undertaken to identify a  signature of PD through the quantification of serum amino  and derivatives.Twenty older adults with PD (11 men and 9 women; mean age 73.1 ± 10.2 years) and 30 age-matched controls (14 men and 16 women; mean age 74.6 ± 4.3 years) were enrolled. A panel of 37 serum amino  and derivatives was assessed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Partial least squares - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) followed by double cross-validation was used to characterize the relationship between amino  profiles and PD.The optimal complexity of the PLS-DA model was found to be three latent variables. The proportion of correct classifications was 99.3 ± 2.5% for participants with PD and 94.7 ± 3.0% for non-PD controls. Higher levels of β-amino butyric , cystine, ornithine, phosphoethanolamine, and proline defined the circulating amino  profile of older people with PD. Controls were characterized by higher concentrations of 3-methyl-histidine, citrulline, and serine.Our findings indicate the existence of a distinct metabotype in older persons with PD. Future studies will have to establish whether changes in amino   are involved in the pathogenesis of PD. This knowledge may be harnessed to identify novel disease biomarkers as well as new targets for interventions.Copyright © 2019.

We hypothesize that the utilization of metabolomic techniques will allow for an improved understanding of the biochemical basis for the pharmacological activity of MTX, and can promote the identification and evaluation of novel molecular biomarkers of MTX response. In this work, erythroblastoid cells were exposed to MTX at the physiologic concentration of 1,000 nM and analyzed using three metabolomic platforms to give a broad spectrum of cellular metabolites. MTX pharmacological activity, defined as cellular growth inhibition, was associated with an altered cellular metabolomic profile based on the analysis of 724 identified metabolites. By discriminant analysis, MTX treatment was associated with increases in ketoisovaleric , fructose, galactose, and 2-deoxycytidine, and corresponding reductions in 2-deoxyuridine, phosphatidylinositol 32:0, orotic , and inosine monophosphate. Inclusion of data from analysis of folate  in combination with chemometric and  network analysis demonstrated that MTX treatment is associated with dysregulated folate  and nucleotide biosynthesis, which is in line with its known mechanism of action. However, MTX treatment was also associated with alterations in a diversity of metabolites, including intermediates of amino , carbohydrate, and lipid . Collectively, these findings support a robust  response following exposure to physiologic concentrations of MTX. They also identify various  intermediates that are associated with the pharmacological activity of MTX, and are, therefore, potential molecular biomarker candidates in future preclinical and clinical studies of MTX efficacy in autoimmune arthritis.© 2019 The Authors.

Mutations in MFN2 cause the neurodegenerative disease Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A (CMT2A). The molecular basis underlying the physiological and pathological relevance of MFN2 is unclear. Here, we present crystal structures of truncated human MFN2 in different nucleotide-loading states. Unlike other dynamin superfamily members including MFN1, MFN2 forms sustained dimers even after GTP hydrolysis via the GTPase domain (G) interface, which accounts for its high membrane-tethering efficiency. The biochemical discrepancy between human MFN2 and MFN1 largely derives from a primate-only single amino  variance. MFN2 and MFN1 can form heterodimers via the G interface in a nucleotide-dependent manner. CMT2A-related mutations, mapping to different functional zones of MFN2, lead to changes in GTP hydrolysis and homo/hetero-association ability. Our study provides fundamental insight into how mitofusins mediate mitochondrial fusion and the ways their disruptions cause disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669517>Untargeted Multi-Omic Analysis of Colorectal Cancer-Specific Exosomes Reveals Joint  of Colorectal Cancer in both Clinical Samples and Cell Culture.</a></h2><p>Exosomes are naturally secreted nano-vesicles consisting of biochemical molecules including RNAs, metabolites, lipids, and proteins, that emerge as diagnostic tools and disease-specific reporters. Here we offer a systematic and integrative approach for the simultaneous analysis of altered molecules namely metabolites, lipids, and proteins. These components tend to augment the discovery of low abundance signature components, and assist in explanation of molecular basis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In order to investigate CRC-derived exosomes, we selected mi-R19a, miR-21, miR-92a, and miR-1246 positive exosomes for downstream experiments. The overall multi-omic changes were investigated comparatively in cell culture and serum samples. Following a systematic multi-omic study, 37 (cell culture) and 31 (serum) metabolites; 130 (cell culture) and 56 (serum) lipids; 9 (cell culture) and 13 (serum) proteins were seen to be differentially expressed (p<0.05), enabling discrimination between CRC and control. By using these enriched components, we demonstrated that the joint  mainly involving fatty  and amino   related  changed in CRC significantly. We conclude that this study increases our understanding of molecular basis of CRC, and provides potential exosomal biomarkers for the non-invasive detection, and discrimination of CRC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

After surface sterilization, the seeds were sown on seedling trays. Forty-day-old plants were then transferred to hydroponic cultures with Cd (40 μM) or without Cd (control). Some biochemical and physiological parameters were assayed on the sixth day after Cd treatment. Based on the results, the plants showed an increase in leaf soluble carbohydrates, total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity at the end of the exposure period. However, length, fresh weight, chlorophyll (Chl) b, total Chl, stomatal conductance and starch content decreased under Cd treatment. There was no significant difference between the plants exposed to Cd and the control group for Chl a, SPAD index, carotenoids, and anthocyanins as well as the HO content six days after treatment. The Cd content in the roots was considerably higher than that in the shoots. In assessing the antioxidant capacity of plant extracts, different results were observed using 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) test and beta-carotene/linoleic  bleaching assay. According to the results of this study, it seems that increased activity of PAL enzyme leads to an increase in biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in M. parviflora. This mechanism probably increases the antioxidant capacity of the plant to suppress Cd-induced toxicity and oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We report a new high-resolution system to measure the stable carbon isotopic composition of carboxyl atoms within amino . The automated system used HPLC to separate amino  followed by addition of ninhydrin for decarboxylation and transfer of the evolved CO2 to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer for δ13CCARBOXYL measurement. The ninhydrin reaction was conducted at acidic pH (1.5) and elevated temperature (160 oC) giving yields close to 100% for most common amino . Eight mammalian keratin samples from herbivores (kudu and caribou), omnivores (humans) and carnivores (bowhead and humpback zooplanktivorous whales) were analysed with this new system. The data provide an initial calibration of reference materials to be used in studies of this type and is the first report of carboxyl carbon isotope distributions in mammals. Results showed widespread 13C enrichments in both essential and non-essential amino  carboxyl groups, likely linked to decarboxylation of amino  during normal . Analyses of non-essential amino  isotope profiles showed (1) consistent and general taxon-level  differences between the herbivore, human and whale samples, (2) marked differences among individual humans, ruminants and whales (3) evidence for gluconeogenesis in the wildlife samples, and (4) extensive 13C enrichment likely associated with fasting in the humpback whale sample. Future mammalian research related to the  of growth, reproduction, aging and disease may benefit from using this technique.

Recent Advances: Excessive production of RNS triggers nitric oxide (NO)-mediated posttranslational modifications of proteins, such as S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues and nitration of tyrosine residues. Proteins thus affected impair mitochondrial , mitochondrial dynamics, and mitophagy in the nervous system.Identification and better characterization of underlying molecular mechanisms for NO-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction will provide important insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries concerning S-nitrosylation of the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle enzymes, mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1, and mitophagy-related proteins Parkin and PINK1. We delineate signaling cascades affected by pathologically S-nitrosylated proteins that diminish mitochondrial function in neurodegenerative diseases.Further elucidation of the pathological events resulting from aberrant S-nitrosothiol or nitrotyrosine formation may lead to new therapeutic approaches to ameliorate neurodegenerative disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659239>Uncarboxylated osteocalcin ameliorates hepatic glucose and lipid  in KKAy mice via activating insulin signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Osteocalcin, expressed in osteoblasts of the bone marrow, undergoes post-translational carboxylation and deposits in mineralized bone matrix. A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with  syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid  in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose , hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty- β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating  syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664147>Leucine-rich diet induces a shift in tumour  from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, reducing glucose consumption and metastasis in Walker-256 tumour-bearing rats.</a></h2><p>Leucine can stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, and recent studies have shown an increase in leucine-related mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation capacity in muscle cells. However, leucine-related effects in tumour tissues are still poorly understood. Thus, we described the effects of leucine in both in vivo and in vitro models of a Walker-256 tumour. Tumour-bearing Wistar rats were randomly distributed into a control group (W; normoprotein diet) and leucine group (LW; leucine-rich diet [normoprotein + 3% leucine]). After 20 days of tumour evolution, the animals underwent -fludeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (F-FDG PET-CT) imaging, and after euthanasia, fresh tumour biopsy samples were taken for oxygen consumption rate measurements (Oroboros Oxygraph), electron microscopy analysis and RNA and protein extraction. Our main results from the LW group showed no tumour size change, lower tumour glucose (F-FDG) uptake, and reduced metastatic sites. Furthermore, leucine stimulated a shift in tumour  from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, higher mRNA and protein expression of oxidative phosphorylation components, and enhanced mitochondrial density/area even though the leucine-treated tumour had a higher number of apoptotic nuclei with increased oxidative stress. In summary, a leucine-rich diet directed Walker-256 tumour  to a less glycolytic phenotype profile in which these  alterations were associated with a decrease in tumour aggressiveness and reduction in the number of metastatic sites in rats fed a diet supplemented with this branched-chain amino .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659573>A transcriptomic study of selenium against liver injury induced by beta-cypermethrin in mice by RNA-seq.</a></h2><p>Evidence from biochemical liver function index and histopathology analysis suggested that selenium could effectively repair the liver injury caused by beta-cypermethrin (β-CYP). However, the molecular mechanism of selenium against liver injury induced by β-CYP remains unclear. In the present study, dynamic changes in gene expression profiles before and after the treatment of NaSeO in liver injury mice were analyzed by using RNA sequencing. As a result, several essential genes and  were identified to be significantly associated with this process. In particular, ten genes including Cyp2j11, Cyp2b10, Cyp3a13, Dhrs9, Socs2, Stat4, Gm13305, Cyp3a44, Retsat, and Cyp26b1 were significantly enriched in the functional categories related to retinol , linoleic  , and Jak-STAT signaling pathway. Among them, the expression patterns of nine genes were validated by qRT-PCR, except for Cyp3a44. Furthermore, we have constructed the associated regulatory network based on the identified targets revealed by high throughput screening.

Its biological conversion into a stable form can be obtained through urea hydrolysis, subsequent nitrification, and organics removal, to recover a nitrate-enriched stream, free of oxygen demand. In this study, the utilization of a microbial community for urine nitrification was optimized with the focus for space application. To assess the role of selected parameters that can impact ureolysis in urine, the activity of six ureolytic heterotrophs ( and ) was tested at different salinities, urea, and amino  concentrations. The interaction of the ureolytic heterotrophs with a nitrifying consortium ( ATCC 19718 and  ATCC 25931) was also tested. Lastly, microgravity was simulated in a clinostat utilizing hardware for in-flight experiments with active microbial cultures. The results indicate salt inhibition of the ureolysis at 30 mS cm, while amino  nitrogen inhibits ureolysis in a strain-dependent manner. The combination of the nitrifiers with  and  resulted in a complete halt of the urea hydrolysis process, while in the case of  incomplete nitrification was observed, and nitrite was not oxidized further to nitrate. Nitrate production was confirmed in all the other communities; however, the other heterotrophic strains most likely induced oxygen competition in the test setup, and nitrite accumulation was observed. Samples exposed to low-shear modeled microgravity through clinorotation behaved similarly to the static controls. Overall, nitrate production from urea was successfully demonstrated with synthetic microbial communities under terrestrial and simulated space gravity conditions, corroborating the application of this process in space.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656522>The effects of post-partum drops in body condition on indices of energy  in mid-lactation Holstein cows.</a></h2><p>Evaluation of energy  indices in mid-lactation Holstein cows is critical to monitor health status.  The objective of this study was to assess the effects of low (≤0.75) . high (>0.75) drops in body condition score (BCS) until day 60 post-partum on energy  indices during mid-lactation in Holstein cows.Twenty-eight Holstein cows were included in the study from the day of calving to day 120 of lactation. Whole blood samples were taken on 60, 90, and 120 days in milk (DIM). Serum was analyzed for insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels.In cows with low BCS drop (LoD group), insulin did not change significantly through days 60 to 120 of lactation, but increased in high drop cows (HiD group) (P<0.001). Glucose concentrations decreased linearly in the LoD cows (P=0.039) and showed a quadratic increase in the HiD group on day 90 (P=0.028). Concentrations of non-esterified fatty  showed both linear (P=0.04) and quadratic (P=0.002) changes in the HiD group. The HiD cows had significantly higher concentrations of insulin on day 120 (P=0.017) compared to the LoD group. Glucose concentration was lower (P<0.01) in HiD cows on 60 DIM. The concentration of non-esterified fatty  was higher in HiD cows on day 90 (P<0.01). Surrogate indices of insulin resistance (calculated based on the concentrations of the measured metabolites) were different between the groups on day 90, indicating decreased insulin sensitivity in the HiD cows.Greater depletion of body reserves during early lactation may result in some inconsistencies in energy  during mid-lactation periods. Controlling BCS loss during early lactation may help alleviate such alterations possibly through modifying insulin sensitivity of the tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668396>PAR2 controls cholesterol homeostasis and lipid  in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Increases in hepatic and plasma cholesterol occur in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although the reason for this is not well understood. We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in NAFLD.Human liver biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by liver fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of liver biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and liver assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total liver cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile  output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced fatty  β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in liver glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/2 as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in liver.These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related  conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal microbiota were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate " were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty  (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic microbiota to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the activities of these  in hepatomas in vivo have not been distinguished. Here we examined pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle through PDH versus PC in vivo using hepatoma-bearing rats.Hepatoma-bearing rats were generated by intrahepatic injection of H4IIE cells.  of C-labeled glycerol, a physiological substrate for both gluconeogenesis and energy production, was measured with C NMR analysis. The concentration of key metabolites and the expression of relevant enzymes were measured in hepatoma, surrounding liver, and normal liver.In orthotopic hepatomas, pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle occurred exclusively through PDH and the excess PDH activity compared to normal liver was attributed to downregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 2/4. However, pyruvate carboxylation via PC and gluconeogenesis were minimal, which was linked to downregulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by Akt activity. In contrast to many studies of cancer , lactate production in hepatomas was not increased which corresponded to reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase. The production of serine and glycine in hepatomas was enhanced, but glycine decarboxylase was downregulated.The combination of [U-C]glycerol and NMR analysis enabled investigation of multiple biochemical processes in hepatomas and surrounding liver. We demonstrated active PDH and other related  alterations in orthotopic hepatomas that differed substantially not only from the host organ but also from many earlier studies with cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Amongst these toxins, the most frequent and most studied have been alcohol and tobacco consumption, with a proven increased rate of overall cancer risk within the aero-digestive tract.The review was realized utilizing available studies on the subject of genetic polymorphisms analysis of deoxyribonucleic  (DNA) samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and laryngeal cancer published in the PubMed database.Statistical analysis of 262 polymorphisms shows a predominantly positive association between two genetic variants of the human genome (mutant homozygote and heterozygote) and cancer risk with significant influence on patient outcome and survival. Genotype combinations were divided into two categories depending on the individual 'at risk' and 'protective' allele within the loci of each inherited gene block. Amongst the genes involved with aero-digestive cancers, the most studied were those belonging to the xenobiotic , nucleotide excision repair (NER) and DNA repair . The presence of toxins has a distinct cumulative effect within the genotype-phenotype relationship, which further influences the presence of malignancy depending on the adaptability of each individual genome.Laryngeal cancer evolution is linked to inherited risk factors found within the genetic code. Most studied were the genes belonging to NER , DNA repair and xenobiotic , which all favored mutant homozygote and heterozygote variants, as high risk factors. Only five articles focused on overall survival rates with insufficient results to undisputedly predict the risk variants. The consumption of external toxins has a positive effect on the overall cancer risk in consumers. Most articles affirmed further evaluation or replication was needed in a larger scale population to conclusively validate their results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669116>The association of short-chain fatty  and leptin : a systematic review.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this systematic review is to analyze the available evidence linking short-chain fatty  (SCFA) to leptin's levels and production. We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty  receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These patients receive low-toxicity disease-stabilizing treatment. The combination of all-trans retinoic  (ATRA) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic  can stabilize the disease for a subset of such patients. We performed untargeted serum metabolomic profiling for 44 AML patients receiving treatment based on ATRA and valproic  combined with low-dose cytotoxic drugs (cytarabine, hydroxyurea, 6-mercaptopurin) which identified 886 metabolites. When comparing pretreatment samples from responders and non-responders, metabolites mainly belonging to amino  and lipid (i.e., fatty )  were altered. Furthermore, patients with rapidly progressive disease showed an extensively altered lipid . Both ATRA and valproic  monotherapy also altered the amino  and lipid metabolite profiles; however, these changes were only highly significant for valproic  treatment. Twenty-three metabolites were significantly altered by seven-day valproic  treatment ( < 0.05,  < 0.05), where the majority of altered metabolites belonged to lipid (especially fatty  ) and amino  , including several carnitines. These metabolomic effects, and especially the effects on lipid , may be important for the antileukemic and epigenetic effects of this treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652380>Prognostic significance of serum tyrosine concentration in patients with primary biliary cholangitis under ursodeoxycholic  therapy.</a></h2><p>Chronic liver insufficiency is often associated with alteration in amino  . We evaluated the prognostic value of changes in serum amino  concentrations in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) METHODS: Seventy-five PBC patients who started urusodeoxycholic  (UDCA) therapy were retrospectively enrolled. Baseline serum concentrations of branched-chain amino  (BCAAs) and tyrosine, and BCAA-to-tyrosine ratio (BTR) were determined. The hazard ratios (HRs) of factors associated with liver-related events were analyzed by Cox proportional hazard analysis.Of the 75 patients enrolled, 12 showed a decrease in serum BCAA levels and 15 showed an increase in serum tyrosine levels. The BTR decreased in 16 patients. During a median 5.6-year follow-up, liver-related events occurred in 11 patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that high serum tyrosine levels at baseline and high alkaline phosphatase levels 48 weeks after starting UDCA therapy were independent risk factors for event occurrence. From the receiver operator characteristics curve analysis, serum tyrosine concentration >110 μmol/L was identified as a cutoff value with an adjusted HR 20.9 (95% confidence interval: 4.3-101.5, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the 5-year cumulative incidences of event occurrence in patients with high and low serum tyrosine concentration were 56.5% and 5.5%, respectively (P < 0.001). The 10-year survival probabilities also showed significant differences between patients with high and low serum tyrosine concentration (44.9% vs. 92.0%, P < 0.001).Elevation of serum tyrosine concentration indicates high risk of liver-related events in PBC patients under UDCA therapy.This article is protected by copyright.

As a consequence, Poldip2 deficiency induces  reprograming with repressed mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolytic activity. Though homozygous deletion of Poldip2 is lethal, heterozygous mice are viable and show protection against aneurysm and injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia, diseases linked to loss of VSMC differentiation. Thus, we hypothesize that the  reprograming induced by Poldip2 deficiency controls VSMC differentiation.  To determine the role of Poldip2-mediated  reprograming in phenotypic modulation of VSMC.  We show that Poldip2 deficiency in vascular smooth muscle in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of the serum response factor (SRF), Myocardin, and MRTFA and dramatically represses KLF4. Consequently, Poldip2-deficient VSMC and mouse aorta express high levels of contractile proteins and, more significantly, these cells do not dedifferentiate nor acquire macrophage-like characteristics when exposed to Cholesterol or PDGF. Regarding the mechanism, we found that Poldip2 deficiency upregulates the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and OGT-mediated protein O-GlcNAcylation. Increased protein glycosylation causes the inhibition of a nuclear UPS responsible for SRF stabilization and KLF4 repression and is required for the establishment of the differentiated phenotype in Poldip2-deficient cells.  Our data show that Poldip2 deficiency induces a highly differentiated phenotype in VSMCs through a mechanism that involves regulation of  and proteostasis. Additionally, our study positions mitochondria-initiated signaling as key element of the VSMC differentiation programs that can be targeted to modulate VSMC phenotype during vascular diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660859>Genomic characteristics and comparative genomics analysis of the endophytic fungus Sarocladium brachiariae.</a></h2><p>Sarocladium brachiariae is a newly identified endophytic fungus isolated from Brachiaria brizantha. A previous study indicated that S. brachiariae had antifungal activity; however, limited genomic information restrains further study. Therefore, we sequenced the genome of S. brachiariae and compared it with the genome of S. oryzae to identify differences between a Sarocladium plant pathogen and an endophyte.In this study, we reported a gapless genome sequence of a newly identified endophytic fungus Sarocladium brachiariae isolated from Brachiaria brizantha. The genome of S. brachiariae is 31.86 Mb, with a contig N50 of 3.27 Mb and 9903 protein coding genes. Phylogenomic analysis based on single copy orthologous genes provided insights into the evolutionary relationships of S. brachiariae and its closest species was identified as S. oryzae. Comparative genomics analysis revealed that S. brachiaria has 14.9% more plant cell wall degradation related CAZymes to S. oryzae, and 33.3% more fungal cell wall degradation related CAZymes, which could explain the antifungal activity of S. brachiaria. Based on Antibiotics & Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) analysis, we identified a contact helvolic  biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for the first time in S. oryzae. However, S. brachiaria had seven fewer terpene gene clusters, including helvolic  BGC, compared with S. oryzae and this may be associated with adaptation to an endophytic lifestyle. Synteny analysis of polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), and hybrid (PKS-NRPS) gene clusters between S. brachiariae and S. oryzae revealed that just 37.5% of tested clusters have good synteny, while 63.5% have no or poor synteny. This indicated that the S. brachiariae could potentially synthesize a variety of unknown-function secondary metabolites, which may play an important role in adaptation to its endophytic lifestyle and antifungal activity.The data provided a better understanding of the Sarocladium brachiariae genome. Further comparative genomic analysis provided insight into the genomic basis of its endophytic lifestyle and antifungal activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671820>Vitamin C in Plants: From Functions to Biofortification.</a></h2><p>Vitamin C (l-ascorbic ) is an excellent free radical scavenger, not only for its capability to donate reducing equivalents but also for the relative stability of the derived monodehydroascorbate radical. However, vitamin C is not only an antioxidant, since it is also a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in plant and human . In humans, vitamin C takes part in various physiological processes, such as iron absorption, collagen synthesis, immune stimulation, and epigenetic regulation. Due to the functional loss of the gene coding for l-gulonolactone oxidase, humans cannot synthesize vitamin C; thus, they principally utilize plant-based foods for their needs. For this reason, increasing the vitamin C content of crops could have helpful effects on human health. To achieve this objective, exhaustive knowledge of the  and functions of vitamin C in plants is needed. In this review, the multiple roles of vitamin C in plant physiology as well as the regulation of its content, through biosynthetic or recycling , are analyzed. Finally, attention is paid to the strategies that have been used to increase the content of vitamin C in crops, emphasizing not only the improvement of nutritional value of the crops but also the acquisition of plant stress resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657414>Roles of different n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios in ovarian cell development and steroidogenesis in PCOS rats.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and common endocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, which is accompanied by follicle growth arrest at the small antral stage, minimal granulosa cell proliferation, and chronic anovulation. Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) are necessary for the body's , growth and development. Although PUFAs play an important role in the regulation of female reproduction, their role in ovarian development in PCOS is still unclear. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of different ratios of n-3/n-6 PUFAs (omega-3/omega-6) on ovary development in PCOS rats. Serum levels of reproductive hormones and enzymes related to steroidogenesis were assessed. The results indicated that PUFAs (n-3/n-6: 1/15) significantly increased ovarian weight and improved the ovarian structure although they had no significant effect on body weight in PCOS rats. Meanwhile, apoptosis was attenuated accompanied by increased cell proliferation by PUFAs (n-3/n-6: 1/15). Moreover, serum levels of hormones (FSH and E2) were also significantly increased by PUFAs (n-3/n-6: 1/15) accompanied by decreased T levels. To investigate whether PUFAs regulate the expression of enzymes related to hormone synthesis, western blotting was used to determine the protein levels of CYP51, CYP19, StAR and 3β-HSD. The results showed that PUFAs significantly increased the protein levels of all of these enzymes. These results indicate that PUFAs enhance the reproductive performance of PCOS by increasing the expression of steroidogenesis enzymes, which are related to hormone secretion and ovarian functions. These findings provide evidence that a balanced n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio is beneficial for PCOS reproduction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661818>Melatonin-Induced Transcriptome Variation of Rapeseed Seedlings under Salt Stress.</a></h2><p>Salt stress inhibits the production of all crop species, including rapeseed ( L.), the second most widely planted oil crop species. Although melatonin was confirmed to alleviate salt stress in rapeseed seedlings recently, the mechanism governing the expression levels remains unknown. Therefore, the melatonin-induced transcriptome variation of salt-stressed seedlings was explored. In this study, the transcriptomes of leaves and roots under control (CK), salt (125 mM NaCl, ST) and melatonin (125 mM NaCl plus 50 µM melatonin, MS) treatments were evaluated by using next-generation sequencing techniques. After conducting comparisons of gene expression in the roots and leaves between MS and ST, the differentially expressed gene (DEG) pools were screened. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses highlighted the significant , which were mainly related to plant hormone synthesis and signal transduction, lignin and fatty  . The functional genes in the objective KEGG  were identified. Furthermore, members of several transcription factor (TF) families participated in the response process. Combined with the hormone (campesterol (CS), jasmonic  (JA), and gibberellic  3 (GA3)) contents measured in the seedlings, it could be concluded that melatonin induced changes in the intrinsic hormone  network, which promoted seedling growth. Thus, this study identified new candidate genes and  active during the interactions between melatonin and salt stress, which provide clues for disclosing melatonin's function in resistance to salt injury.

The accurate quantification of steroid hormones is needed for both research into clinical conditions as well as for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. The improved analytical method for 39 steroid profiling in urine was developed using LC-MS/MS. As a pre-treatment procedure prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, hydrolysis using β-glucuronidase and solid-phase extraction for purifying the samples were performed. Steroids were separated using Waters ACQUITY @ BEH C column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 μm) and a mobile phase consisting of eluent A (0.01% formic  and 1 mM ammonium formate in water) and eluent B (0.01% formic  and 1 mM ammonium formate in methanol) with a gradient program at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. Under the optimized method, the linearity of calibration curves was higher than 0.992. The limits of detection (LOD) at signal to noise (S/N) ratio of 3 were 0.03-90 ng/mL. The developed novel LC-MS/MS method can quantitatively profile 39 steroids in a single analytical run. Steroid profiling based on quantitative results could improve the diagnosis and monitoring of hormone-dependent diseases.This article is protected by copyright.

During hibernation, serum levels of cortisol, glycerol, and triglycerides were elevated, and protein expression and activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue were reduced. mRNA expression of the co-activator PGC-1α was reduced in all tissues in hibernation whereas mRNA expression of the transcription factor PPAR-α was reduced in the vastus lateralis muscle and adipose tissue only. During hibernation, gene expression of ATGL and CD36 was not altered; however, HSL gene expression was reduced in adipose tissue. During hibernation gene expression of the lipogenic enzyme DGAT in all tissues and the expression of the FA oxidative enzyme LCAD in the vastus lateralis muscle were reduced. Gene and protein expression of the glucose transporter GLUT4 was decreased in adipose tissue in hibernation. Our data suggest that high cortisol levels are a key adaptation during hibernation and link cortisol to a reduced activation of the AMPK/PGC-1α/PPAR-α axis in the regulation of  in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Moreover, our results indicate that during this phase of hibernation at a time when  rate is significantly reduced  adaptations in peripheral tissues seek to limit the detrimental effects of unduly large energy dissipation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Protein phosphorylation carries out an important regulatory function in plant defense responses, while the global phosphoproteome changes in rice response to SA-mediated defense response has not been reported. In this study, a comparative phosphoproteomic profiling was conducted by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, with two near-isogenic rice cultivars after SA treatment.Thirty-seven phosphoprotein spots were differentially expressed after SA treatment, twenty-nine of which were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, belonging to nine functional categories. Phosphoproteins involved in photosynthesis, antioxidative enzymes, molecular chaperones were similarly expressed in the two cultivars, suggesting SA might alleviate decreases in plant photosynthesis, regulate the antioxidant defense activities, thus improving basal resistance response in both cultivars. Meanwhile, phosphoproteins related to defense, carbohydrate , protein synthesis and degradation were differentially expressed, suggesting phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may coordinate complex cellular activities in the two cultivars. Furthermore, the phosphorylation sites of four identified phosphoproteins were verified by NanoLC-MS/MS, and phosphorylated regulation of three enzymes (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, phosphoglycerate mutase and ascorbate peroxidase) was validated by activity determination.Our study suggested that phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may contribute to the different resistance response of the two cultivars. To our knowledge, this is the first report to measure rice phosphoproteomic changes in response to SA, which provides new insights into molecular mechanisms of SA-induced rice defense.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657789>A Fluorescence-based Assay for Characterization and Quantification of Lipid Droplet Formation in Human Intestinal Organoids.</a></h2><p>Dietary lipids are taken up as free fatty  (FAs) by the intestinal epithelium. These FAs are intracellularly converted into triglyceride (TG) molecules, before they are packaged into chylomicrons for transport to the lymph or into cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) for intracellular storage. A crucial step for the formation of LDs is the catalytic activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) in the final step of TG synthesis. LDs are important to buffer toxic lipid species and regulate cellular  in different cell types. Since the human intestinal epithelium is regularly confronted with high concentrations of lipids, LD formation is of great importance to regulate homeostasis. Here we describe a simple assay for the characterization and quantification of LD formation (LDF) upon stimulation with the most common unsaturated fatty , oleic , in human intestinal organoids. The LDF assay is based on the LD-specific fluorescent dye LD540, which allows for quantification of LDs by confocal microscopy, fluorescent plate reader, or flow cytometry. The LDF assay can be used to characterize LD formation in human intestinal epithelial cells, or to study human (genetic) disorders that affect LD , such as DGAT1 deficiency. Furthermore, this assay can also be used in a high-throughput pipeline to test novel therapeutic compounds, which restore defects in LD formation in intestinal or other types of organoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666959>Non-aqueous fractionation revealed changing subcellular metabolite distribution during apple fruit development.</a></h2><p>In developing apple fruit,  compartmentation is poorly understood due to the lack of experimental data. Distinguishing subcellular compartments in fruit using non-aqueous fractionation has been technically difficult due to the excess amount of sugars present in the different subcellular compartments limiting the resolution of the technique. The work described in this study represents the first attempt to apply non-aqueous fractionation to developing apple fruit, covering the major events occurring during fruit development (cell division, cell expansion, and maturation). Here we describe the non-aqueous fractionation method to study the subcellular compartmentation of metabolites during apple fruit development considering three main cellular compartments (cytosol, plastids, and vacuole). Evidence is presented that most of the sugars and organic  were predominantly located in the vacuole, whereas some of the amino  were distributed between the cytosol and the vacuole. The results showed a shift in the plastid marker from the lightest fractions in the early growth stage to the dense fractions in the later fruit growth stages. This implies that the accumulation of starch content with progressing fruit development substantially influenced the distribution of plastidial fragments within the non-aqueous density gradient applied. Results from this study provide substantial baseline information on assessing the subcellular compartmentation of metabolites in apple fruit in general and during fruit growth in particular.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661763>Polyphenol Effects on Cholesterol  via Bile  Biosynthesis, CYP7A1: A Review.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis, the main contributor to coronary heart disease, is characterised by an accumulation of lipids such as cholesterol in the arterial wall. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) reduces cholesterol via its conversion into bile  (BAs). During RCT in non-hepatic peripheral tissues, cholesterol is transferred to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and returned to the liver for conversion into BAs predominantly via the rate-limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Numerous reports have described that polyphenol induced increases in BA excretion and corresponding reductions in total and LDL cholesterol in animal and in-vitro studies, but the process whereby this occurs has not been extensively reviewed. There are three main mechanisms by which BA excretion can be augmented: (1) increased expression of CYP7A1; (2) reduced expression of intestinal BA transporters; and (3) changes in the gut microbiota. Here we summarise the BA   focusing on CYP7A1, how its gene is regulated via transcription factors, diurnal rhythms, and microRNAs. Importantly, we will address the following questions: (1) Can polyphenols enhance BA secretion by modulating the CYP7A1 biosynthetic pathway? (2) Can polyphenols alter the BA pool via changes in the gut microbiota? (3) Which polyphenols are the most promising candidates for future research? We conclude that while in rodents some polyphenols induce CYP7A1 expression predominantly by the LXRα pathway, in human cells, this may occur through FXR, NF-KB, and ERK signalling. Additionally, gut microbiota is important for the de-conjugation and excretion of BAs. Puerarin, resveratrol, and quercetin are promising candidates for further research in this area.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665416>IMG-ABC v.5.0: an update to the IMG/Atlas of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters Knowledgebase.</a></h2><p>Microbial secondary  is a reservoir of bioactive compounds of immense biotechnological and biomedical potential.

This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice. Energy  was determined based on the energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty , leptin, and glucose were assessed using the respective kits. Insulin resistance in the whole body was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test. mRNA associated with energy  expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in body weight, fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in energy ; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of insulin resistance, which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice.

However, it remains to be determined if these alterations associated with AET persist when measured in energy balance (EB) in the days following the last bout of training. . The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that improvements in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function induced by AET observed in previous literature would persist when measured after restoring EB conditions 72 hours removed from the last exercise bout.Participants were 14 premenopausal women (age = 31.2 ± 6.7 years, BMI = 26.6 ± 5.1 kg/m). The AET program required 3 monitored training sessions per week for 8-16 weeks. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and following 8-16 weeks of AET (≥72 hrs after the last exercise bout). All food was provided for 72 hours prior to biopsies and EB was managed 24 hours prior to testing within ±100 kcal of measured energy requirements using a whole-room calorimeter. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity was quantified in permeabilized muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis.We found that AET increased coupled respiration (154%) and uncoupled respiration (90%) rates using a fatty  substrate (palmitoyl carnitine) (P<0.05). However, when rates were normalized to complex IV activity (a marker of mitochondrial content), no significant differences were observed. Additionally, there were no changes in proteins known to mediate mitochondrial biogenesis or lipid transport and  following AET.8-16 weeks of AET improved mitochondrial capacity under fatty  substrate when assessed in EB, which appears to be due to mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668641>Amino  License Kinase mTORC1 Activity and Treg Cell Function via Small G Proteins Rag and Rheb.</a></h2><p>Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical mediators of immune tolerance whose activity depends upon T cell receptor (TCR) and mTORC1 kinase signaling, but the mechanisms that dictate functional activation of these  are incompletely understood. Here, we showed that amino  license Treg cell function by priming and sustaining TCR-induced mTORC1 activity. mTORC1 activation was induced by amino , especially arginine and leucine, accompanied by the dynamic lysosomal localization of the mTOR and Tsc complexes. Rag and Rheb GTPases were central regulators of amino -dependent mTORC1 activation in effector Treg (eTreg) cells. Mice bearing RagA-RagB- or Rheb1-Rheb2-deficient Treg cells developed a fatal autoimmune disease and had reduced eTreg cell accumulation and function.

Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is one of the widespread anthocyanins in plants, and cyanidin (Cy) is the aglycone of C3G that can be generated in intestine under gut microorganism . To explore the anti-inflammatory activity of single anthocyanins compound and show the potential mechanism, the protective effects of C3G and its aglycone Cy on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco-2 cellular monolayer inflammation were studied. The results showed that both C3G and Cy significantly improved the clinical symptoms and relieved the histological damage in TNBS-challenged mice. The activity of myeloperoxidase and the excretion of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interferon- were also significantly inhibited at the administration dosage of 200 mol/kg.  studies showed that when LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were pretreated with C3G and Cy, the destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier was ameliorated due to the improvement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux values, while there were no significant difference between C3G and Cy groups at the same dosage. Similarly, both C3G and Cy suppressed nitric oxide production and inflammatory cytokines secretion of LPS-induced Caco-2 cells. C3G and its aglycone Cy had similar anti-inflammatory activity in both colitis mice and Caco-2 cells. The results suggest that C3G and Cy may exert anti-inflammatory effects by protecting the intestinal barrier as well as by suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion. Thus, C3G or Cy could be potential preventive agents or supplementary medicines for inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666452>Identification and Validation of Plasma Metabolomics Reveal Potential Biomarkers for Coronary Heart Disease.</a></h2><p>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a prevalent and chronic life-threatening disease. However, there is no reliable way for early diagnosis and prevention of CHD so far. The precise molecular pathological mechanism of CHD remains obscure. Therefore, developing novel biomarkers is urgently needed.In order to evaluate the potential of untargeted plasma metabolomics in biomarker discovery for characterizing CHD, plasma metabolites from patients newly diagnosed with CHD and controls were profiled using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Differential metabolites were identified using both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Metabolites with significant changes were subjected to binary logistic regression analysis, and a CHD prediction model was established. A total of 28 differential plasma metabolites were identified, of which the concentrations of 11 increased significantly and those of 17 decreased significantly in patients with CHD compared with controls. The altered   included reduced phospholipid , increased monoglyceride , and abnormal fatty  . Furthermore, binary logistic regression showed that nine metabolites could be used as potential plasma biomarkers for the diagnosis of CHD. The prediction model based on these nine metabolites was then tested with an independent cohort of samples (area under the curve = 0.929).Our plasma metabolomics study not only yielded fundamental insights into dysregulated  in CHD but also presented a combinatorial biomarker that might support the clinical diagnosis of CHD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671884>Haplotype Networking of GWAS Hits for Citrulline Variation Associated with the Domestication of Watermelon.</a></h2><p>Watermelon is a good source of citrulline, a non-protein amino . Citrulline has several therapeutic and clinical implications as it produces nitric oxide via arginine. In plants, citrulline plays a pivotal role in nitrogen transport and osmoprotection. The purpose of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with citrulline  using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and understand the role of citrulline in watermelon domestication. A watermelon collection consisting of 187 wild, landraces, and cultivated accessions was used to estimate citrulline content. An association analysis involved a total of 12,125 SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.05 in understanding the population structure and phylogeny in light of citrulline accumulation. Wild egusi types and landraces contained low to medium citrulline content, whereas cultivars had higher content, which suggests that obtaining higher content of citrulline is a domesticated trait. GWAS analysis identified candidate genes ( and  ) showing a significant association of SNPs with citrulline content. Haplotype networking indicated positive selection from wild to domesticated watermelon. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing genetic regulation of citrulline variation in plants by using a GWAS strategy. These results provide new insights into the citrulline  in plants and the possibility of incorporating high citrulline as a trait in watermelon breeding programs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669173>Acetylome profiling of Vibrio alginolyticus reveals its role in bacterial virulence.</a></h2><p>It is well known that lysine acetylation (Kace) modification is a common post-translational modification (PTM) that plays an important role in multiple biological and pathological functions in bacteria. However, few studies have focused on lysine acetylation modification in aquatic pathogens to date. In this study, the acetylome profiling of fish pathogen, Vibrio alginolyticus was investigated by combining affinity enrichment with LC MS/MS. A total of 2883 acetylation modification sites on 1178 proteins in this pathogen were identified. The Kace modification of several selected proteins were further validated by Co-immunocoprecipitation combined with Western blotting. Bioinformatics analysis showed that seven conserved motifs can be enriched among Kace peptides, and many of them were significantly enriched in  processes such as biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, microbial  in diverse environments, and biosynthesis of amino , which was similar to data previously published for V. parahaemolyticus. Moreover, we found at least 102 acetylation modified proteins predicted as virulence factors, which indicate the important role of PTM on bacterial virulence. In general, our results provide a promising starting point for further investigations of the biological role of lysine acetylation on bacterial virulence in V. alginolyticus.

PUFA levels are influenced by nutrition and genetic factors. The relationship between PUFA composition in red blood cells (RBCs) and genetic variations involved in PUFA  has not been investigated in children with obesity. This study evaluated the association between several genetic variations and PUFA levels in RBCs in children with obesity. One hundred ninety-six children with obesity (101 females, 95 males) were evaluated using anthropometric measurements, dietary intakes, plasma and RBC PUFA quantification, blood biochemistry, and 55 single nucleotide polymorphisms within 14 genes. phosphatidylethanolamine -methyltransferase () rs1109859 and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene () rs4846052 genotypes were associated with PUFA levels in RBCs. PUFA intake did not influence the RBC eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) levels. Higher RBC DHA and EPA levels were observed for  rs1109859 GG and GA genotypes versus the AA genotype. Higher levels of RBC DHA, EPA, arachidonic  (ARA), and linoleic  (LA) and were observed for  rs4846052 TT genotype versus TC and CC genotypes. Genetic variations in  rs1109859 and  rs4846052 were associated with different PUFA levels in RBC membranes and are estimators for PUFA species in RBCs.

To investigate the underlying systems biology of Allo action in AD models in vivo, we assessed the regulation of Allo on the bioenergetic system of the brain. Outcomes of these analysis indicated that Allo significantly reversed deficits in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis and key mitochondrial enzyme activity and reduced lipid peroxidation in the 3xTgAD mice in vivo. To explore the mechanisms by which Allo regulates the brain , we conducted targeted transcriptome analysis. These data further confirmed that Allo upregulated genes involved in glucose , mitochondrial bioenergetics, and signaling  while simultaneously downregulating genes involved in Alzheimer's pathology, fatty  , and mitochondrial uncoupling and dynamics. Upstream regulatory pathway analysis predicted that Allo induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A)  while simultaneously inhibiting the presenilin 1 (PSEN 1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)  to reduce AD pathology. Collectively, these data indicate that Allo functions as a systems biology regulator of bioenergetics, cholesterol homeostasis, and β-amyloid reduction in the brain. These systems are critical to neurological health, thus providing a plausible mechanistic rationale for Allo as a therapeutic to promote neural cell function and reduce the burden of AD pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655313>Metabolomic evidence for the therapeutic effect of gentiopicroside in a corticosterone-induced model of depression.</a></h2><p>Depression is a disease that seriously threatens the quality of human life. To explore the effect of gentiopicroside on depression, this study investigated the therapeutic effect of gentiopicroside on corticosterone-induced depressionin vivo and in vitro by using metabolomic methods.A total of 36 rats were randomly assigned to three groups: a normal group, model group (depression), and treatment group (depression + gentiopicroside). Corticosterone was administrated to induce depression-like model rats. Morris water maze test was used to validated the behavior performance. The hippocampus of rats was obtained for metabolomic detection. Metabolites that were differentially expressed between the groups were extracted for Heatmap, Go, and pathway enrichment analyses. Finally, neuronal cells were cultured and examined to validated the effect of gentiopicroside.Corticosterone injured rats learning capacity, and decreased the levels of 5-HT, and reversed by gentiopicroside delivery. Metabolites obtained from the hippocampus of rats in the three groups were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA). Go and pathway enrichment analyses revealed the involvement of sphingolipid  et al. Gentiopicroside could inhibit apoptosis caused by corticosterone, and also decrease neuronal cell proliferation and BDNF levels in vitro. Arachidonic  (ARA) reversed the protective effect of gentiopicroside on neuronal cells.These findings suggest that gentiopicroside reduces apoptosis and increases the proliferation of hippocampus cells in depressed animals by regulating metabolites. Moreover, our study provides a new basis for the clinical treatment of depression and demonstrates the potential efficacy of gentiopicroside in this area of pathology.Copyright © 2019.

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty  (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major  controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like  condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed to compare the endophytic bacterial community in the four crucial Allium species in China, Chinese leek (CL), garlic (GA), onion (ON,) and Welsh onion (WO), using sequences of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. A total of 1,036,637 high-quality sequences and 719 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained across all libraries. A total of 20 phyla, 50 classes, 80 orders, 134 families, and 234 genera were identified. Among them, 18 OTUs and 19 genera were shared among the four Allium species. Proteobacteria (42.68%) and Bacteroidetes (20.18%) were the dominant phyla in CL, while one unclassified (>70%) was the dominant phyla in the other three Allium species. The alpha-diversity analysis showed the bacterial richness and diversity in CL were significantly higher than those in the other three Allium species. Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) showed endophytic bacterial communities in GA, WO, and ON were more similar than those in CL. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis revealed endophytic bacteria mostly enriched in Membrane Transport, Amino   and Carbohydrate  pathway. 17 of the 23 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) categories and 159 of the 206 lower-level KEGG  in CL were significantly higher than those in the other three Allium species. Pearson's correlation indicated that KEGG  with significant differences among the Allium species were closely related to the bacterial genera with significant differences between the Allium species.

Nutritional constituents strongly influence composition and functional properties of the intestinal microbial communities. Here, we report that omission of a single essential amino  - tryptophan - from the diet abrogates CNS autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Dietary tryptophan restriction results in impaired encephalitogenic T cell responses and is accompanied by a mild intestinal inflammatory response and a profound phenotypic shift of gut microbiota. Protective effects of dietary tryptophan restriction are abrogated in germ-free mice, but are independent of canonical host sensors of intracellular tryptophan metabolites. We conclude that dietary tryptophan restriction alters  properties of gut microbiota, which in turn have an impact on encephalitogenic T cell responses. This link between gut microbiota, dietary tryptophan and adaptive immunity may help to develop therapeutic strategies for protection from autoimmune neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660551>Study of gastrointestinal tract viability and motility via modulation of serotonin in a zebrafish model by probiotics.</a></h2><p>The relationship between bacterial strains and serotonin regulation was studied via the in vitro screening of the strains.

Several kinases use PPi as a substrate and these kinases have recently been suggested to have evolved from ATP-dependent functional homologs, which have significant amino  sequence similarity to PPi-utilizing enzymes. In contrast, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) can be divided into three types according to the phosphate donor (ATP, GTP, or PPi), and the amino  sequence similarity of these PEPCKs is too low to confirm that they share a common ancestor. Here, we solved the crystal structure of a PPi-PEPCK homolog from the bacterium Actinomyces israelii (AiPEPCK) at 2.6 Å resolution and compared it with previously reported structures from ATP- and GTP-specific PEPCKs to assess the degrees of similarities and divergences among these PEPCKs and to determine the structural basis for the PPi specificity of PPi-type PEPCKs. These comparisons revealed that the amino  residues directly contributing to substrate recognition, except for those that recognize purine moieties, are conserved. Furthermore, the order of secondary structure elements between PPi-, ATP- and GTP-specific PEPCKs was strictly conserved. The structure-based comparisons of the three PEPCK types provide key insights into the structural basis for PPi specificity and suggest that all of these PEPCKs are derived from a common ancestor.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650134>Regulation effects of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis Linn.) on hepatic lipid  in OA induced NAFLD rats.</a></h2><p>Rosmarinus officinalis Linn. is a kind of medicinal and edible homologous plant, which is popular in the Mediterranean region with a significant effect on mind tranquilization, anti-oxidation, and  improvement.

The present study used rats fed high-cholesterol (Chol) diets supplemented with or without 0.5% Dio for 6 wk to investigate the effects of dietary Dio on lipid . Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile  content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile . A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral fat was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Dio may not only induce myoblast fusion and enhance skeletal muscle as an energy expenditure organ, but may also activate the catabolic pathway via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, these effects of Dio on skeletal muscles may contribute to inhibition of visceral fat accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655474>The role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in reactive oxygen species  in apple exocarp induced by acibenzolar-S-methyl.</a></h2><p>Apple exocarp was used to investigate the effect of acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) treatments on reaction oxygen species (ROS) . The results indicated that ASM enhanced the hydrogen peroxide (HO) content, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), glutathione reductase (GR) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). ASM also increased the contents of ascorbic  (AsA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and nicotinamide ademine dinucleotidephosphate (NADPH), MdSOD and MdAPX expression, but decreased MdMDHAR and dehydroascorbate reductase (MdDHAR) expression. DHEA suppressed HO accumulation and POD, APX, MDHAR, G6PDH activities, but increased SOD, CAT and GR activities compared to the control. ASM and DHEA treatments suppressed the contents of AsA, GSH and NADPH, and expression of MdSOD, MdAPX and MdMDHAR.

Therefore, targeting these processes using localized delivery of a minimally toxic drug combination may be a promising strategy. Here, we present engineering of a biocompatible self-assembled lithocholic -dipeptide derived hydrogel (TRI-Gel) that can maintain sustained delivery of antiproliferating doxorubicin, antiangiogenic combretastatin-A4 and anti-inflammatory dexamethasone. Application of TRI-Gel therapy to a murine tumor model promotes enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent reduction in angiogenesis and inflammation, leading to effective abrogation of tumor proliferation and increased median survival with reduced drug resistance. In-depth RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TRI-Gel therapy induced transcriptome-wide alternative splicing of many genes responsible for oncogenic transformation including sphingolipid genes. We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in β-glucocerebrosidase 1 (), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, TRI-Gel therapy provides a unique system that affects the TME via post-transcriptional modulations of sphingolipid  genes, thereby opening a new and rational approach to cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664444>Effect of Combination l-Citrulline and Metformin Treatment on Motor Function in Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Nitric oxide precursors, such as the amino  l-arginine and the biguanide antidiabetic drug metformin, have been associated with  and muscle function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The treatment of DMD remains an unmet medical need.To evaluate the benefits and harms of a combination of l-citrulline and metformin treatment among patients with DMD.A single-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group clinical trial was conducted between December 12, 2013, and March 30, 2016, at the University Children's Hospital Basel in Switzerland. A total of 47 ambulant male patients aged 6.5 to 10 years with genetically confirmed DMD were recruited locally and from the patient registries of Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and France. Data were analyzed from April 6, 2016, to September 5, 2019.Patients in the treatment group received 2500 mg of l-citrulline and 250 mg of metformin (combination therapy) 3 times a day for 26 weeks compared with patients in the control group, who received placebo.The primary end point was the change in transfer and standing posture, as assessed by the first dimension of the Motor Function Measure, version 32, from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included assessments of timed function, quantitative muscle force, biomarkers for muscle necrosis, and adverse events. The 2 prespecified subgroups comprised patients who were able to walk 350 m or more in 6 minutes (stable subgroup) and patients who were not able to walk 350 m in 6 minutes (unstable subgroup) at baseline.Among 49 ambulant male children with DMD who were screened for eligibility, 47 patients with a mean (SD) age of 8.2 (1.1) years were randomized to a treatment group receiving combination therapy (n = 23) or a control group receiving placebo (n = 24), and 45 patients completed the study. No significant differences between groups were found in the results of timed function and muscle force tests for overall, proximal and axial, and distal motor function. Among patients receiving combination therapy, the Motor Function Measure first dimension subscore decrease was 5.5% greater than that of patients receiving placebo (95% CI, -1.0% to 12.1%; P = .09). The administration of combination therapy had significantly favorable effects on the first dimension subscore decrease among the 29 patients in the stable subgroup (6.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-12.6%; P = .03) but not among the 15 patients in the unstable subgroup (3.9%; 95% CI, -13.2% to 20.9%; P = .63). Overall, the treatment was well tolerated with only mild adverse effects.Treatment with combination therapy was not associated with an overall reduction in motor function decline among ambulant patients with DMD; however, a reduction in motor function decline was observed among the stable subgroup of patients treated with combination therapy. The statistically nonsignificant difference of distal motor function in favor of combination therapy and the reduced degeneration of muscle tissue appear to support the treatment concept, but the study may have lacked sufficient statistical power. Further research exploring this treatment option with a greater number of patients is warranted.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670380>Metabolomics study of fasudil on cisplatin-induced kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Fasudil is a derivative of 5-isoquinoline sulfonamide, which is a Rho kinase inhibitor, a wide range of pharmacological effects.

In their lifespan, cardiomyocytes undergo a dynamic maturation process from the fetal to adult stage, radically changing their , morphology, contractile and electrical properties. Before employing cells of human origin, in vitro models often use neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) to obtain key proof-of-principles. Nevertheless, NRCM monolayers de-differentiate when maintained under standard culture conditions, significantly decreasing the expression of mature hallmark-proteins. Supplementation of free fatty  (FFA), the main energy source for mature cardiomyocytes, and co-culture with fibroblasts are each by itself known to promote the shift from fetal to adult cardiomyocytes. Using a co-culture system, our study investigates the effects of FFA on the cardiomyocyte phenotype in comparison to glucose as typical fetal energy source, and to 10% serum used as standard control condition. Compared to the control condition, FFA- and glucose-supplementation both preserved cardiomyocyte differentiation and functionality with a higher expression of specific (troponin-I) and mature (myosin-light-chain-2v) cardiac markers at the protein- and mRNA-levels. FFA caused a significant increase in the cardiomyocyte contractility compared to the glucose-condition. Moreover, only FFA-supplementation enhanced beta-oxidation-based , typical of mature cardiomyocytes. Our findings indicate that cardiomyocytes in co-culture with fibroblasts benefit from FFA-supplementation by better maintaining their differentiated state in vitro.Copyright © 2019.

In addition, the differential and tissue specific proteolytic processing of the glucagon precursor and the presence in of several glucagon-like sequences, not only in the precursor of glucagon, but also in a number of other peptides of the glucagon-secretin family of peptides, put special demands on the specificity of the assays. Finally, experience has shown that unspecific interference of plasma components has presented additional problems. All of these problems have resulted in a lot of diverging results concerning measured and reported glucagon responses in both humans and experimental animals that have and still are causing considerable debate and controversy. There is very solid evidence that glucagon is an important hormone in human and mammalian , but its precise physiological role in glucose and lipid  and in  disease has been difficult to establish, not least because of these difficulties. It was our purpose with this review to discuss the methods of glucagon quantification and discuss pitfalls and sources of error.

Fruits of bitter melon () contain various cucurbitacins possessing an unusual ether bridge between C5 and C19, not observed in other Cucurbitaceae members. Using a combination of next-generation sequencing and RNA-seq analysis and gene-to-gene co-expression analysis with the ConfeitoGUIplus software, we identified three P450 genes, , , and , expected to be involved in cucurbitacin biosynthesis. CYP81AQ19 co-expression with cucurbitadienol synthase in yeast resulted in the production of cucurbita-5,24-diene-3β,23α-diol. A mild  treatment of this compound resulted in an isomerization of the C23-OH group to C25-OH with the concomitant migration of a double bond, suggesting that a non-enzymatic transformation may account for the observed C25-OH in the majority of cucurbitacins found in plants. The functional expression of CYP88L7 resulted in the production of hydroxylated C19, as well as C5-C19 ether-bridged products. A plausible mechanism for the formation of the C5-C19 ether bridge involves C7 and C19 hydroxylations, indicating a multifunctional nature of this P450. On the other hand, functional CYP88L8 expression gave a single product, a triterpene diol, indicating a monofunctional P450 catalyzing the C7 hydroxylation. Our findings of the roles of several plant P450s in cucurbitacin biosynthesis reveal that an allylic hydroxylation is a key enzymatic transformation that triggers subsequent processes to produce structurally diverse products.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673919>The actinobacterium Tsukamurella paurometabola has a functionally divergent arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) homolog.</a></h2><p>Actinobacteria in the Tsukamurella genus are aerobic, high-GC, Gram-positive mycolata, considered as opportunistic pathogens and isolated from various environmental sources, including sites contaminated with oil, urban or industrial waste and pesticides. Although studies look into xenobiotic biotransformation by Tsukamurella isolates, the relevant enzymes remain uncharacterized. We investigated the arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzyme family, known for its role in the xenobiotic  of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Xenobiotic sensitivity of Tsukamurella paurometabola type strain DSM 20162 was assessed, followed by cloning, recombinant expression and functional characterization of its single NAT homolog (TSUPD)NAT1. The bacterium appeared quite robust against chloroanilines, but more sensitive to 4-anisidine and 2-aminophenol. However,  activity was not evident towards those compounds, presumably due to mechanisms protecting cells from xenobiotic entry. Of the pharmaceutical arylhydrazines tested, hydralazine was toxic, but the bacterium was less sensitive to isoniazid, a drug targeting mycolic  biosynthesis in mycobacteria. Although (TSUPD)NAT1 protein has an atypical Cys-His-Glu (instead of the expected Cys-His-Asp) catalytic triad, it is enzymatically active, suggesting that this deviation is likely due to evolutionary adaptation potentially serving a different function. The protein was indeed found to use malonyl-CoA, instead of the archetypal acetyl-CoA, as its preferred donor substrate. Malonyl-CoA is important for microbial biosynthesis of fatty  (including mycolic ) and polyketide chains, and the corresponding enzymatic systems have common evolutionary histories, also linked to xenobiotic . This study adds to accummulating evidence suggesting broad phylogenetic and functional divergence of microbial NAT enzymes that goes beyond xenobiotic  and merits investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668874>Lipids in the Bone Marrow: An Evolving Perspective.</a></h2><p>Because of heavy energy demands to maintain bone homeostasis, the skeletal system is closely tied to whole-body  via neuronal and hormonal mediators. Glucose, amino , and fatty  are the chief fuel sources for bone resident cells during its remodeling. Lipids, which can be mobilized from intracellular depots in the bone marrow, can be a potent source of fatty . Thus, while it has been suggested that adipocytes in the bone marrow act as "filler" and are detrimental to skeletal homeostasis, we propose that marrow lipids are, in fact, essential for proper bone functioning. As such, we examine the prevailing evidence regarding the storage, use, and export of lipids within the skeletal niche, including from both in vitro and in vivo model systems. We also highlight the numerous challenges that remain to fully appreciate the relationship of lipid turnover to skeletal homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To better understand the  of  on a systematic level, we manually constructed a genome-scale  model of the  type strain UA159. The model, called iSMU, contains 675 reactions involving 429 metabolites and the products of 493 genes. We validated iSMU by comparing simulations with growth experiments in defined medium. The model simulations matched experimental results for 17 of 18 carbon source utilization assays and 47 of 49 nutrient depletion assays. We also simulated the effects of single gene deletions. The model's predictions agreed with 78.1% and 84.4% of the gene essentiality predictions from two experimental data sets. Our manually curated model is more accurate than  models generated from automated reconstruction pipelines and more complete than other manually curated models. We used iSMU to generate hypotheses about the   network. Subsequent genetic experiments confirmed that (i)  catabolizes sorbitol via a sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase (SMU_308) and (ii) the Leloir pathway is required for growth on complex carbohydrates such as raffinose.

Mammals have three GGAs (GGA1-3) that work not only at the trans-Golgi network, but also in endosomes to sort transmembrane cargo proteins such as mannose 6-phosphate receptors, sortilin, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, and epidermal growth factor receptor. The cytoplasmic regions of these cargoes possess motifs of acidic amino  cluster-dileucine and/or ubiquitination sites, which can be recognized by GGAs. Despite seminal investigations of the three molecules, their in vivo roles and functional redundancies, as well as relationships with a heterotetrameric adaptor protein, AP-1, which is functionally similar to GGAs were still poorly understood. Studies over the past two decades, however, discovered several new GGA cargoes, their interaction modes, and accessory proteins. These findings collectively suggest distinct and more fundamental roles of each GGA in regulating neuronal survival, lipid , and cell proliferation. This review aims to provide an update to the GGA research focusing on how GGAs became considered not only as players in the context of the TGN-endosome transport, but also as key regulators for physiologically and pathologically important phenomena.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652726>Transcriptomic Revelation of Phenolic Compounds Involved in Aluminum Toxicity Responses in Roots of Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.</a></h2><p> Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) is one of the most important coniferous evergreen tree species in South China due to its desirable attributes of fast growth and production of strong and hardy wood. However, the yield of Chinese fir is often inhibited by aluminum (Al) toxicity in acidic soils of South China. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of Chinese fir root responses to Al toxicity might help to further increase its productivity. Here we used the Illumina Hiseq4000 platform to carry out transcriptome analysis of Chinese fir roots subjected to Al toxicity conditions. A total of 88.88 Gb of clean data was generated from 12 samples and assembled into 105,732 distinct unigenes. The average length and N50 length of these unigenes were 839 bp and 1411 bp, respectively. Among them, 58362 unigenes were annotated through searches of five public databases (Nr: NCBI non-redundant protein sequences, Swiss-Prot: A manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database, GO: Gene Ontology, KOG/COG: Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins, and KEGG: the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database), which led to association of unigenes with 44 GO terms. Plus, 1615 transcription factors (TFs) were functionally classified. Then, differentially expressed genes (DEGs, |log(fold change)| ≥ 1 and FDR ≤ 0.05) were identified in comparisons labelled TC1 (CK-72 h/CK-1 h) and TC2 (Al-72 h/Al-1 h). A large number of TC2 DEGs group were identified, with most being down-regulated under Al stress, while TC1 DEGs were primarily up-regulated. Combining GO, KEGG, and MapMan pathway analysis indicated that many DEGs are involved in primary , including cell wall  and lipid , while other DEGs are associated with signaling  and secondary , including flavonoids and phenylpropanoids . Furthermore, TFs identified in TC1 and TC2 DEGs represented 21 and 40 transcription factor families, respectively. Among them, expression of bHLH, C2H2, ERF, bZIP, GRAS, and MYB TFs changed considerably under Al stress, which suggests that these TFs might play crucial roles in Chinese fir root responses to Al toxicity. These differentially expressed TFs might act in concert with flavonoid and phenylpropanoid pathway genes in fulfilling of key roles in Chinese fir roots responding to Al toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673703>Glucagon-Receptor Signaling Reverses Hepatic Steatosis Independent of Leptin Receptor Expression.</a></h2><p>Glucagon (GCG) is an essential regulator of glucose and lipid  that also promotes weight loss. We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases fatty  oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces liver triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression. Liver leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease liver triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and liver-specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔliver) were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days. Liver triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in liver tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔliver mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in body weight or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔliver mice reduced liver triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar liver lipid targets, these appear to be two distinct .© Endocrine Society 2019.

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile  (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic , activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654382>A Synthetic Snake-Venom-Based Tripeptide Protects PC12 Cells from the Neurotoxicity of Acrolein by Improving Axonal Plasticity and Bioenergetics.</a></h2><p>The synthetic peptide p-BTX-I is based on the native peptide (formed by glutamic , valine and tryptophan) isolated from Bothrops atrox venom. We have previously demonstrated its neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties in PC12 cells treated with the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). Now, we have investigated the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of p-BTX-I against the toxicity of acrolein in PC12 cells. Studies have demonstrated that acrolein might play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by neuronal and synaptic loss. Our results showed that not only acrolein reduced cell differentiation and cell viability, but also altered the expression of markers of synaptic communication (synapsin I), energy  (AMPK-α, Sirt I and glucose uptake), and cytoskeleton (β-III-tubulin). Treatment with p-BTX-I increased the percentage of differentiation in cells treated with acrolein and significantly attenuated cell viability loss, besides counteracting the negative effects of acrolein on synapsin I, AMPK-α, Sirt I, glucose uptake, and β-III-tubulin. Additionally, p-BTX-I alone increased the expression of apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene, associated with the proteolytic degradation of β-amyloid peptide aggregates, a hallmark of AD.

Mitochondria are important mediators of  flexibility and dysfunction is associated with  inflexibility and pathology. Foodborne toxins are often overlooked as potential factors contributing to  toxicity. Fusaric  (FA), a neglected mycotoxin, is known to disrupt mitochondrial function. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying a  switch in response to FA. This study investigated the effects of FA on energy homeostasis in cultured human liver (HepG2) cells. HepG2 cells poised to undergo oxidative and glycolytic  were exposed to a range of FA concentrations (4, 63 and 250 µg/mL) for 6 hours. We determined mitochondrial toxicity, acetyl CoA levels and cell viability using luminometric, fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods. Expression of  proteins (PDK1, PKM2, phosphorylated-PDH E1α and HIF-1α) and mRNAs (HIF-1α, PKM2, LDHa and PDK1) were determined using western blot and qPCR respectively. Our data connects a constitutive expression of HIF-1α in response to FA, to the inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylation through up-regulation of PDK-1 and phosphorylation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1α subunit. Moreover, we highlight the potential of FA to induce a glucose "addiction" and phenotype reminiscent of the Warburg effect.

While the protective mechanisms are not fully understood in mammals, they are presumably mediated through  regulation and suppression of protein translation by reduced phosphorylation of 4EBP1, a target of mTORC1. Using transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and Gαq overexpression-induced heart failure models, we examined the effect of cardiac-specific heterozygous deletion (het) of Raptor, a component of mTORC1, and cardiac-specific transgenic overexpression of wild type or phosphorylation site mutant 4EBP1. In wild-type mice with TAC-induced heart failure, quantitative shotgun proteomics revealed decreased abundance of proteins of mitochondrial  and increased abundance of proteins in oxidative stress response, ubiquitin, and other . The Raptor het ameliorated both TAC- and Gαq overexpression-induced heart failure and the associated proteomic remodeling, especially those  involved in mitochondrial function, citric  cycle, and ubiquitination. In contrast, transgenic overexpression of either wild type or mutant 4EBP1 aggravated TAC and Gαq, consistent with reduced adaptive hypertrophy by suppression of protein translation, in parallel with adverse remodeling of left ventricular proteomes. Partial mTORC1 inhibition by Raptor heterozygous deletion ameliorates heart failure and is associated with better preservation of the mitochondrial proteome; however, this effect does not appear to be mediated through suppression of protein translation by increased 4EBP1.

Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) has been reported to decrease dietary protein levels, promote intestinal health in piglets and reduce environmental pollution. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKG are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low-protein diet supplementation of AKG on the growth performance, nitrogen , relative expression of amino  transporter genes and mTOR signalling pathway of skeletal muscle in piglets. Forty-eight piglets with an initial weight of 11.53 ± 0.04 kg were randomly divided into four groups. Each group had four replicates, and each replicate had three pigs. A low-protein (LP) diet (crude protein was 14.96%) served as the control without AKG, while 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% AKG were added to the LP diet for the other experimental groups. The trial period lasted for 28 days. Compared with the LP group, the LP + 1.0%A and LP + 1.5%A groups increased the growth performance (p < .05);increased the mRNA levels of amino  transporters in the duodenum, anterior jejunum and posterior jejunum (p < .05); and reduced faecal nitrogen and urine nitrogen emissions (p < .05). They also showed greater mRNA levels and phosphorylated protein levels for S6 kinase beta (S6K) (p < .05), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (p < .05) and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) (p < .05) in skeletal muscle. An LP diet supplemented with AKG activated the mTOR signalling and promoted the ability of the small intestine to absorb protein, thereby increasing protein deposition. Taken together, an LP diet supplemented with AKG provides a theoretical basis for the promotion and application of AKG in piglet production.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674709>Evolutionary adaptation of Aspergillus niger for increased ferulic  tolerance.</a></h2><p>To create an Aspergillus niger mutant with increased tolerance against ferulic  using evolutionary adaptation.Evolutionary adaptation of Aspergillus niger N402 was performed by consecutive growth on increasing concentrations of ferulic  in the presence of 25 mmol l D-fructose, starting from 0·5 mmol l and ending with 5 mmol l ferulic .

Here, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model in rats and humans for the propyl  series including propyl acetate, 1-propanol, propionaldehyde, and propionic . Manufacturers use these compounds as organic solvents and intermediates during chemical synthesis. Public exposures can occur through using consumer products containing propyl compounds like cosmetics, aerosol sprays, or foods, and occupational exposures can occur at manufacturing facilities. To develop the PBPK model, we measured in vitro  of propyl acetate in blood and liver S9 fractions. We measured concentrations of propyl compounds in blood following intravenous (iv) infusion of C-propanol or C-propionic  and closed chamber inhalation exposures to propyl acetate or propanol in rats. Using these studies and other published data, we modified an existing PBPK model for the butyl  series to simulate time course concentrations of propyl compounds in rats and humans. Consistent with measured in vitro and in vivo data, the optimized propyl series model predicts rapid clearance of propyl acetate, higher concentrations of propanol in blood from propyl acetate inhalation compared to propanol inhalation in rats but not in humans, and low concentrations of propionic  in blood from exposures to propyl acetate or propanol. Regulators can use this model as a tool for propyl compound risk assessment by linking internal dosimetries under various exposure scenarios.Copyright © 2019.

Studies on TBBPA toxicity have been conducted using various target cells; however, few studies have investigated TBBPA toxicity in bone cells. Therefore, this study investigated the in vitro effects of TBBPA on osteoclasts, a cell type involved in bone .RAW264.7 cells were cultured in medium containing 50 ng/mL receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and varying concentrations of TBBPA. To evaluate the effects of TBBPA on the differentiation and function of osteoclasts, osteoclast-specific gene expression, tartrate-resistant  phosphatase (TRAP) activity, bone resorbing activity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial superoxide were measured.The presence of 20 μ TBBPA significantly increased TRAP activity in RANKL-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, the bone resorbing activity of osteoclasts, and the gene expression of Akt2, nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1, and chloride channel voltage-sensitive 7. However, TBBPA treatment caused no change in the expression of carbonic anhydrase II, cathepsin K, osteopetrosis-associated transmembrane protein 1, , extracellular signal-related kinase, , , or matrix metalloproteinase 9. Furthermore, 20 μ TBBPA caused a significant decrease in MMP and a significant increase in mitochondrial superoxide production.This study suggests that TBBPA promotes osteoclast differentiation and activity. The mechanism of TBBPA-stimulated osteoclastogenesis might include increased expression of several genes involved in osteoclast differentiation and reactive oxygen species production.© 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657926>Digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-enriched phosphoethanolamine plasmalogens based on gastrointestinal functions in healthy mice.</a></h2><p>EPA-enriched phosphoethanolamine plasmalogens (EPA-pPE), widely present in marine creatures, is a unique glycerophospholipid with EPA at the sn-2 position of glycerol backbone. EPA-pPE has been reported to exhibit numerous distinctive bioactivities. However, the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE in vivo are not clear, which restrict the molecular mechanism analysis related to its distinctive activities. The aim of the present study was to illustrate the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE by lipid analysis in serum, intestinal wall and content after oral administration of EPA-pPE emulsion. Results showed the EPA percentage of total fatty  in serum was increasing over time, with two peaks at 5 and 10 h by 1.89±0.2 and 2.58±0.27, respectively, then fell from 1.89±0.17 at 10h to 1.35±0.16 at16h. In small intestinal content, EPA-pPE was hydrolyzed to lyso-phospholipids and EPA by phospholipases A2, the vinyl ether bond was retained at the sn-1 position. The released EPA could be quickly taken up into the enterocytes and enter circulation. The comparison of simulated digestion in vitro showed that the distinct digestion and absorption process of EPA-pPE was a unique phenomenon. EPA could be retained in serum at high level for a substantial period of time, which suggested us that EPA-pPE was not just a short-lived circulating molecular.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657265> Remodeling in the Pressure-Loaded Right Ventricle: Shifts in Glucose and Fatty  -A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Background Right ventricular (RV) failure because of chronic pressure load is an important determinant of outcome in pulmonary hypertension. Progression towards RV failure is characterized by diastolic dysfunction, fibrosis and  dysregulation.  modulation has been suggested as therapeutic option, yet,  dysregulation may have various faces in different experimental models and disease severity. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify  changes in the pressure loaded RV and formulate recommendations required to optimize translation between animal models and human disease. Methods and Results Medline and EMBASE were searched to identify original studies describing cardiac  variables in the pressure loaded RV. We identified mostly rat-models, inducing pressure load by hypoxia, Sugen-hypoxia, monocrotaline (MCT), pulmonary artery banding (PAB) or strain (fawn hooded rats, FHR), and human studies. Meta-analysis revealed increased Hedges' g (effect size) of the gene expression of GLUT1 and HK1 and glycolytic flux. The expression of MCAD was uniformly decreased. Mitochondrial respiratory capacity and fatty  uptake varied considerably between studies, yet there was a model effect in carbohydrate respiratory capacity in MCT-rats. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis on  remodeling in the pressure-loaded RV showed a consistent increase in glucose uptake and glycolysis, strongly suggest a downregulation of beta-oxidation, and showed divergent and model-specific changes regarding fatty  uptake and oxidative . To translate  results from animal models to human disease, more extensive characterization, including function, and uniformity in methodology and studied variables, will be required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661927>A Shifty Target: Tumor-Initiating Cells and Their .</a></h2><p>Tumor-initiating cells (TICs), or cancer stem cells, constitute highly chemoresistant, asymmetrically dividing, and tumor-initiating populations in cancer and are thought to play a key role in metastatic and chemoresistant disease. Tumor-initiating cells are isolated from cell lines and clinical samples based on features such as sphere formation in stem cell medium and expression of TIC markers, typically a set of outer membrane proteins and certain transcription factors. Although both bulk tumor cells and TICs show an adaptive  plasticity, TIC  is thought to differ and likely in a tumor-specific and growth condition-dependent pattern. In the context of some common solid tumor diseases, we here review reports on how TIC isolation methods and markers associate with  features, with some focus on oxidative , including fatty  and lipid . These have emerged as significant factors in TIC phenotypes, and in tumor biology as a whole. Other sections address mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in TICs, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment. Further elucidation of the complex biology of TICs and their  will require advanced methodologies.</p></html>
