<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16773534>Modulation of Pgp function by boswellic acids.</a></h2><p>Boswellic acids, the main active ingredients of Boswellia serrata, are gaining more and more importance in the treatment of peritumoural oedema and chronic  . They may be even considered as alternative drugs to corticosteroids in reducing cerebral peritumoural oedema. An important focus for drugs acting in the central nervous system is achieving a high extent of brain penetration. Today there is increasing evidence for the importance of transporters, especially P-glycoprotein (Pgp), for drug disposition and resulting clinical response. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the concentrations of the potent keto derivatives, the  (KBA) and the acetyl- (AKBA), in proportion to boswellic acids lacking a keto group, like the beta-boswellic acid, are much lower in plasma than in the orally administered extract. Moreover the brain/plasma ratio for KBA and AKBA determined in preliminary experiments on rats was only about 0.51 and 0.81, respectively, in spite of their lipophilicity. Until now little is known about the cerebral pharmacokinetics of boswellic acids and how it may be influenced. Since many drugs are known to interact with Pgp at the level of the intestine and the blood-brain barrier the modulatory potencies of the Boswellia serrata extract of H15(R) and the major boswellic acids on the transport activity of Pgp have been determined in two in vitro assays. A human lymphocytic leukaemia cell line (VLB cells) expressing Pgp was chosen as model for human Pgp, and porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC cells) were taken as model for the blood-brain barrier using calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM) as Pgp substrate. It was found that the Boswellia extract, as well as the keto-boswellic acids inhibit the transport activity of Pgp in the micromolecular range in both cell types. No modulation was observed using those boswellic acids which have no keto group in their structure. The inhibition of Pgp at the blood-brain barrier by Boswellia extract is probably not relevant for the brain availability of other Pgp substrates, because of the low plasma levels determined for KBA and AKBA. However the presented data could not exclude the possibility of drug interactions caused by modulation of Pgp by extracts of Boswellia serrata on the gastrointestinal level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172516>Improvement of Human-Oral-Epithelial-  and of Tight Junctions by Micronutrients.</a></h2><p>The oral epithelium represents a major interface between an organism and its external environment. Improving this  at the molecular level can provide an organism added protection from microbial-based diseases.   of the Gie-3B11-human-gingival-epithelial-cell-culture model is enhanced by the micronutrients zinc, quercetin, retinoic acid, and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid, as observed by a concentration-dependent increase in transepithelial electrical resistance and a decrease in transepithelial C-d-mannitol permeability. With this improvement of tight-junction (TJ)-  (reduced leak) comes a pattern of micronutrient-induced changes in TJ claudin abundance that is specific to each individual micronutrient, along with changes in claudin subcellular localization. These micronutrients were effective not only when administered to both cell surfaces simultaneously but also when administered to the apical surface alone, the surface to which the micronutrients would be presented in routine clinical use. The biomedical implications of micronutrient enhancement of the oral-epithelial  are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25955295>Boswellia serrata Preserves Intestinal Epithelial Barrier from Oxidative and  Damage.</a></h2><p>Aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are currently the therapeutic choices in  (IBD), however, with limited remission and often serious side effects. Meanwhile complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is increasing, particularly herbal medicine. Boswellia serrata is a traditional Ayurvedic remedy with anti- properties, of interest for its usefulness in IBDs. The mechanism of this pharmacological potential of Boswellia serrata was investigated in colonic epithelial cell monolayers exposed to H2O2 or INF-γ+TNF-α, chosen as in vitro experimental model of intestinal inflammation. The barrier function was evaluated by the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and paracellular permeability assay, and by the tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, ZO-1 and occludin) immunofluorescence. The expression of phosphorylated NF-κB and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were determined by immunoblot and cytofluorimetric assay, respectively. Boswellia serrata oleo-gum extract (BSE) and its pure derivative acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), were tested at 0.1-10 μg/ml and 0.027 μg/ml, respectively. BSE and AKBA safety was demonstrated by no alteration of intestinal cell viability and barrier function and integrity biomarkers. H2O2 or INF-γ+TNF-α treatment of Caco-2 cell monolayers significantly reduced TEER, increased paracellular permeability and caused the disassembly of tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1. BSE and AKBA pretreatment significantly prevented functional and morphological alterations and also the NF-κB phosphorylation induced by the  stimuli. At the same concentrations BSE and AKBA counteracted the increase of ROS caused by H2O2 exposure. Data showed the positive correlation of the antioxidant activity with the mechanism involved in the physiologic maintenance of the integrity and function of the intestinal epithelium. This study elucidates the pharmacological mechanisms mediated by BSE, in protecting intestinal epithelial barrier from  damage and supports its use as safe adjuvant in patients affected by IBD.</p></html>
