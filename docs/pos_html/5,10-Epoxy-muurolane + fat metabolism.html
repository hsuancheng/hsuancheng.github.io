High- diet (HFD) is known to induce inflammatory changes in both scAT and PBMCs. However, the time course of the effect of HFD on these systems is still unknown. The aim of the current study was to determine the time course of the effect of high  diet (HFD) on PBMCs and scAT. New Zealand white rabbits were fed HFD for  or 10 weeks (i.e., HFD- and HFD-10), or regular chow (i.e., CNT- and CNT-10). Thereafter, metabolic and inflammatory parameters of PBMCs and scAT were quantitated. HFD induced hyperfattyacidemia in HFD- and HFD-10 groups, with the development of insulin resistance (IR) in HFD-10, while no changes were observed in scAT  and inflammatory status. HFD activated the inflammatory pathways in PBMCs of HFD- group, and induced modified autophagy in that of HFD-10. The rate of  oxidation in PBMCs was directly associated with the expression of inflammatory markers; and tended to inversely associate with autophagosome formation markers in PBMCs. HFD affected systemic substrate , and the metabolic, inflammatory, and autophagy pathways in PBMCs in the absence of metabolic and inflammatory changes in scAT. Dietary approaches or interventions to avert HFD-induced changes in PBMCs could be essential in prevention of metabolic and inflammatory complications of obesity, and promote healthier living.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565869>The Impact of Timing of Exercise Initiation on Weight Loss: An 18-Month Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the impact of timing of exercise initiation on weight loss within a behavioral weight loss program.Adults with overweight or obesity (N = 170; age 18-55 years; BMI 25-42 kg/m ; 83.% women) were enrolled in an 18-month behavioral weight loss program consisting of a reduced-calorie diet, exercise, and group-based support. The standard group (STD) received a supervised exercise program (progressing to 300 min/wk of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise) during months 0 to 6. The sequential group (SEQ) was asked to refrain from changing exercise during months 0 to 6 and received the supervised exercise program during months 7 to 12. On completion of supervised exercise, both groups were instructed to continue 300 min/wk of moderate-intensity exercise for the study duration.At 6 months, the STD group exhibited greater reductions in body weight (-8.7 ± 0.7 kg) compared with the SEQ group (-6.9 ± 0.6 kg; P = 0.047). Between 6 and 18 months, the STD group regained more weight (2. ± 0.8 kg vs. 0.0 ± 0.8 kg; P = 0.02). At 18 months, there were no between-group differences in changes in weight (STD: -6.9 ± 1.2 kg; SEQ: -7.9 ± 1.2 kg),  mass, lean mass, physical activity, or attrition.Both immediate and delayed exercise initiation within a behavioral weight loss program resulted in clinically meaningful weight loss at 18 months. Thus, timing of exercise initiation can be personalized based on patient preference.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587813>Peripartum Management of Gestational Diabetes Using a Digital Health Care Service: A Pilot, Randomized Controlled Study.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing, and multifaceted interventions are effective in the management of GDM. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a model for the management of GDM with the use of mobile health care.This was a prospective, randomized controlled pilot study. A total of 21 patients who were diagnosed with GDM during 24-28 weeks of gestation were randomly divided into a conventional management (CM) group (n = 10) and a mobile management (MM) group (n = 11). The CM group received conventional GDM management and could freely use the mobile health care application. The MM group received mobile health care services, including tailored mobile coaching. After delivery, obstetric outcomes were collected, and 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed at -12 weeks postpartum.Baseline characteristics, including glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA), were not significantly different between the 2 groups. No statistically significant differences were found in rates between the 2 groups for (1) neonate large for gestational age and (2) cesarean section at the time of delivery. No significant difference was found in HbA between the 2 groups after delivery. However, postpartum homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance, body mass index, weight, and percentage of body  were significantly lower in the MM group.The MM group had no significant difference in glycemic index compared with the CM group. However, the MM group had effective weight control and improved insulin resistance after delivery. This study indicated that mobile health care services could be an efficient GDM management tool.

We evaluated the role of purine , functionally associated lipoperoxidation processes of membrane structures, and the antioxidant system in the development of surgical sepsis in dogs.Dogs with a provisional exclusion of sepsis were included in the study. The control group (Group 1) included clinically healthy dogs (n=), and medium-breed dogs with systemic inflammation response syndrome (n=30) were categorized in the experimental group (Group 2). Along with hemogram and biochemical analysis, we determined the amount of malondialdehyde, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase on the 1 and 14 day of the study. Treatment included a thorough reorganization of the septic focus, followed by antibacterial therapy. Sick animals were injected with a drug (dexamethasone) that suppresses the synthesis and inhibits the action of inflammatory mediators. Decompensation of the functions of organs and systems was carried out using symptomatic therapy.We found that enhanced  peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids of membrane structures stimulates the generalization of inflammatory process, as evidenced by the significant deviation from the physiologically normal values of  peroxidation, C-reactive protein, blood cell count, etc. The course of systemic inflammation associated with surgical sepsis in animals can be attributed to several consistently developing processes that function as a result of increased purine mononucleotide catabolism, peroxide compound formation, and their excessive breakdown in reactions associated with the consumption of glutathione due to the insufficient recovery of glutathione disulfide.The amount of uric acid, glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronic acid in blood plasma, and the content of malondialdehyde, glutathione, and glutathione reductase in erythrocytes should be considered when assessing the severity of the systemic inflammatory process. The increased glutathione requirement in dogs with surgical sepsis requires intervention with pharmacological agents, and further research is needed in this aspect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631099>Empagliflozin's Ameliorating Effect on Plasma Triglycerides: Association with Endothelial Function Recovery in Diabetic Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.</a></h2><p>So far, the mechanisms behind the cardiovascular benefits of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have not been fully clarified.In order to evaluate the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on systemic hemodynamics, glucose ,  profile, and endothelial function, 50 diabetic patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) were included in this analysis and were given empagliflozin 10 mg/d. Cookie meal testing (carbohydrates: 75 g, fats: 28. g), endothelial function testing using flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and body composition evaluation were performed before and after six months of treatment. Changes in %FMD between the treatment periods and its association with metabolic biomarkers were evaluated.After six months of treatment, the body weight and body  percentage decreased significantly, while the body muscle percentage increased significantly. The hemoglobin A1c level and fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels were significantly decreased with treatment. Postprandial insulin secretion was also significantly suppressed and the insulin resistance index was significantly decreased. Furthermore, the fasting and postprandial triglyceride (TG) levels decreased significantly, while total ketone bodies increased significantly after the six-month treatment. While the plasma brain natriuretic peptide level was not changed, the C-reactive protein level was decreased and FMD was significantly improved after the six-month treatment. Multiple regression analysis showed that the strongest predictive factor of FMD improvement is change in the plasma TG levels.SGLT2 inhibitors improve multiple metabolic parameters. Of these, a reduction in plasma TGs was strongly associated with endothelial function recovery in diabetic patients with CAD, and this reduction may be related to the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640107>Low Appendicular Lean Mass and Associations with Metabolic and Demographic Parameters in Wheelchair Athletes with Spinal Cord Injury.</a></h2><p>People suffering from spinal cord injury (SCI) undergo metabolic and physical disturbances that target the skeletal muscle, causing a progressive loss of muscle mass.To estimate the appendicular lean mass (ALM) in athletes with traumatic (T-group) and non-traumatic (NT-group) SCI, and its association with metabolic and demographic parameters.Wheelchair athletes with SCI aged 18 to 52 years old were included (n = 62). From DEXA assessment, we estimated the ALM index (ALMI = appendicular lean mass/height2) and classified participants according to the degree of muscle loss (ALMI <  2 SD from the reference populations). Fasting blood was assayed for glycaemia, insulin, cortisol, and IGF-1 serum levels. Data were compared by T-test and Fisher's Exact Test; predictors of ALMI were investigated by linear regression models.The frequency of low ALM was 63% in overall sample, 55% T-group and 71% NT-group. Low ALM had no significant association with the origin of injury (X2 = 1.1, p = 0.29). Linear regression analyses showed significant association, in the whole sample, between ALMI and serum levels of IGF-1 (Beta = 0.69; p <  0.001), age (Beta=-.8; p <  0.001), percentage  mass (Beta=-0.26; p = 0.001), and energy intake (Beta = 0.32; p = 0.02). These significances were not maintained in the NT-group sub-analyses.Low ALM was very frequent in our SCI participants, despite exercising and independently of the type of injury. Metabolic and demographic variables associated with low ALM were different according to the origin of injury, which possibly relies on physiopathology particularities. More studies are necessary to clarify our findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547820>Elevated CO improves both  accumulation and growth rate in the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase engineered Phaeodactylum tricornutum.</a></h2><p>Numerous studies have shown that stress induction and genetic engineering can effectively increase  accumulation, but lead to a decrease of growth in the majority of microalgae. We previously found that elevated CO concentration increased  productivity as well as growth in Phaeodactylum tricornutum, along with an enhancement of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) activity. The purpose of this work directed toward the verification of the critical role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the OPPP, in  accumulation in P. tricornutum and its simultaneous rapid growth rate under high-CO (0.15%) cultivation.In this study, G6PDH was identified as a target for algal strain improvement, wherein G6PDH gene was successfully overexpressed and antisense knockdown in P. tricornutum, and systematic comparisons of the photosynthesis performance, algal growth,  content, fatty acid profiles, NADPH production, G6PDH activity and transcriptional abundance were performed. The results showed that, due to the enhanced G6PDH activity, transcriptional abundance and NAPDH production, overexpression of G6PDH accompanied by high-CO cultivation resulted in a much higher of both  content and growth in P. tricornutum, while knockdown of G6PDH greatly decreased algal growth as well as  accumulation. In addition, the total proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid, especially the polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:, n-3), were highly increased in high-CO cultivated G6PDH overexpressed strains.The successful of overexpression and antisense knockdown of G6PDH well demonstrated the positive influence of G6PDH on algal growth and  accumulation in P. tricornutum. The improvement of algal growth,  content as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids in high-CO cultivated G6PDH overexpressed P. tricornutum suggested this G6PDH overexpression-high CO cultivation pattern provides an efficient and economical route for algal strain improvement to develop algal-based biodiesel production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555571>Association Between Trp64arg Polymorphism of the β3 adrenoreceptor Gene and Female Sex in Obese Turkish Children and Adolescents.</a></h2><p>The β3-adrenergic receptor () is expressed in visceral adipose tissue and has been speculated to contribute to lipolysis, energy , and regulation of the metabolic rate. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of polymorphism of the  gene with the sex of children with obesity and related pathologies. gene trp64arg genotyping was conducted in 441 children aged 6-18 years. Among these subjects, 264 were obese (103 boys; 161 girls) and 179 were of normal weight (81 boys; 98 girls). In the obese group, fasting lipids, glucose and insulin levels, and blood pressure were measured. Metabolic syndrome (MS) was defined according to the modified World Health Organization criteria adapted for children.The frequency of trp64arg genotype was similar in obese and normal weight children. In obese children, serum , glucose, and insulin levels; homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores; and MS were not different between arg allele carriers (trp64arg) and noncarriers (trp64trp). In 264 obese children, genetic analysis results revealed that the arg allele carriers were significantly higher in girls than in boys (=0.001). In the normal weight group, no statistically significant difference was found between genotypes of boys and girls (=0.771).Trp64arg polymorphism of the  gene was not associated with obesity and MS in Turkish children and adolescents. Although no relationships were observed between the genotypes and lipids, glucose/insulin levels, or HOMA-IR, the presence of trp64arg variant was frequent in obese girls, which can lead to weight gain as well as difficulty in losing weight in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572455>Low expression of brown and beige  genes in subcutaneous tissues in obese patients.</a></h2><p>The molecular mechanisms behind obesity pathogenesis remain largely undefined. Impairment in the browning process of subcutaneous tissues proposed to contribute to obesity pathogenesis. In the current study, we aimed to assess whether the expression of brown  genes in subcutaneous tissues in obese patients is altered as compared to non-obese patients.Participants were recruited from patients undergoing general surgeries. At the same site of surgery, biopsies were taken from the abdominal subcutaneous tissues from each participant, along with a venous blood sample. The expression of BAT genes was measured using a real-time PCR method. Serum FGF21 was measured using an ELISA kit, and the serum blood  profile was measured using the Dimension VistaTM 1500 System.A total of 58 surgical patients was involved. A low expression of BAT genes was observed in the groups with higher body mass index (BMI) (< 30 kg/m) as compared to the groups with lower BMI (> 30 kg/m). The expression of CIDEA and CITED1 was significantly higher in the patients with normal weight as compared to obese ( = 0.01 and  = 0.02, respectively). A significant negative correlation was found between the expression of BAT genes and BMI in patients with BMI < 35 kg/m. However, the strongest negative correlation was observed in the expression of CIDEA ( = -0.,  = 0.004), followed by TBX1 ( = -0.4,  = 0.01), CITED1, and ZIC1 ( = -0.4,  = 0.03). Whereas the correlation of UCP1 with BMI remained insignificant ( = -0.29,  = 0.08). When including patients with BMI > 35 kg/m, the correlation decreased and became insignificant ( = 0.08). No significant correlation was found between the expression of BAT genes and blood  profiles ( > 0.05). Serum FGF21 was positively and significantly correlated to the expression of UCP1 ( = 0.56,  = 0.02) and TBX1 ( = 0.62,  = 0.01), however, this correlation was missing in patients with severe obesity.Our data suggested that brown and beige genes expression in abdominal subcutaneous tissues is dysregulated in patients with obesity.

Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular  content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic  fraction (HFF) and visceral  were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral  (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular  content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty acids and liver  were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for -targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661297>Cardiac overexpression of perilipin 2 induces atrial steatosis, connexin 43 remodeling, and atrial fibrillation in aged mice.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent in patients with obesity and diabetes, and such patients often exhibit cardiac steatosis. Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small  droplets around mitochondrial chains, and - to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (> min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially beneficial against AF in patients with obesity or diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602526>Hepatic FATP5 expression is associated with histological progression and loss of hepatic  in NAFLD patients.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are characterized by the accumulation of excess hepatic . However, in the progression from NASH to cirrhosis, hepatic  is often lost. Our aim was to elucidate the mechanism underlying hepatic  loss during NASH progression.Liver biopsies were performed at The University of Tokyo Hospital between November 2011 and March 2016 on 146 patients with NAFLD and 14 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis who were not being treated with any diabetes or dyslipidemia drugs. Among them, 70 patients underwent liver biopsy after an overnight fast, and 90 patients were biopsied  h after an oral glucose tolerance test. Expression differences in genes encoding several fatty acid -related factors were examined and correlated with hepatic histological changes based on NAFLD activity scores. Prospective patient follow-up continued until June 2018.The level of fatty acid transport protein  (FATP5), which is associated with free fatty acid intake, was significantly and inversely correlated with features of histological progression, including ballooning and fibrosis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Transcript levels of genes encoding fatty acid -related proteins were comparable between NASH with severe fibrosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Furthermore, a prospective cohort study demonstrated that low FATP5 expression was the most significant risk factor for hepatic  loss.Decreased hepatic FATP5 expression in NAFLD is linked to histological progression, and may be associated with hepatic  loss during NASH progression to cirrhosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609315>A Clinical Trial Assessing the Safety, Efficacy, and Delivery of Olive-Oil-Based Three-Chamber Bags for Parenteral Nutrition.</a></h2><p>Limited evidence exists to precisely estimate efficacy and safety differences between parenteral nutrition (PN) prepared using olive-oil-based three-chamber bags (3CBs) and soybean-oil-based compounded bags (CoBs) in hospitalized adult patients. We designed a multicenter, randomized, prospective, open-label, noninferiority protocol to compare the efficacy, safety, and distribution of olive-oil-based 3CBs and soybean-oil-based CoB formulations in adult Chinese patients requiring PN during surgical intervention. Subjects were randomized to receive either one of the study treatments using an interactive voice or web-based recognition system in accordance with the randomization code. Randomization was further stratified based on the study site and surgical category. Both treatment groups received similar amounts of calories and protein. In addition, the two study treatments contained a similar composition of the amino-acid component. The only difference between the two PN formulations was the  constitution. The duration of administration of study treatments was a minimum of  days up to a maximum of 14 days after the surgical procedure. The primary efficacy endpoint was serum prealbumin levels on day  of the study. Noninferiority was proved if the anti-log of the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the treatment difference was at least 0.80. Other efficacy measures included treatment preparation time; duration to achieve tolerability of oral nutrition; associated infectious complications; length of hospitalization; and laboratory assessment of markers of nutrition, inflammation, , and oxidative stress. A total of 458 patients were enrolled in the study. The results showed that olive-oil-based 3CBs were non-inferior to soybean-based CoBs, besides being well tolerated. The infection rate was found to be significantly lower in the olive-oil-based 3CB group. Thus, this study may be used as a reference for future research on  emulsion and 3CBs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620022>Central Treatment of Ketone Body in Rainbow Trout Alters Liver  Without Apparently Altering the Regulation of Food Intake.</a></h2><p>We hypothesize that the presence in fish brain of a ketone body (KB) like β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) alters energy homeostasis through effects on food intake and peripheral energy . Using rainbow trout () as a model, we intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered 1 μl 100 g body mass of saline solution alone (control) or containing 0. μmol of BHB. In a fist set of experiments, BHB did not affect food intake 6 and 24 h after treatment. In a second set of experiments, we evaluated 6 h after ICV BHB treatment changes in parameters putatively related to food intake control in brain areas (hypothalamus and hindbrain) involved in nutrient sensing and changes in energy  in liver. The absence of changes in food intake might relate to the absence of major changes in the cascade of events from the detection of KB through ketone-sensing mechanisms, changes in transcription factors, and changes in the mRNA abundance of neuropeptides regulating food intake. This response is different than that of mammals. In contrast, central administration of BHB induced changes in liver energy  suggesting a decreased use of glucose and probably an enhanced use of amino acid and . These responses in liver are different to those of mammals under similar treatments but comparable to those occurring in fish under food deprivation conditions.Copyright © 2019 Comesaña, Velasco, Conde-Sieira, Otero-Rodiño, Míguez and Soengas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561944>Efficacy of l-carnitine supplementation for management of blood lipids: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h2><p>l-carnitine has an important role in fatty acid  and could therefore act as an adjuvant agent in the improvement of dyslipidemia. The purpose of present systematic review and meta-analysis was to critically assess the efficacy of l-carnitine supplementation on  profiles.We performed a systematic search of all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, The Cochrane Library. Mean difference (MD) of any effect was calculated using a random-effects model. In total, there were 55 eligible RCTs included with 58 arms, and meta-analysis revealed that l-carnitine supplementation significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) (56 arms-MD: -8.53 mg/dl, 95% CI: -13.46, -3.6, I: 93%), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (47 arms-MD: -.48 mg/dl, 95% CI: -8.49, -2.47, I: 94.) and triglyceride (TG) (56 arms-MD: -9.44 mg/dl, 95% CI: -16.02, -2.87, I: 91.8). It also increased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (51 arms-MD:1.64 mg/dl, 95% CI:0.54, 2.75, I: 92.2). l-carnitine supplementation reduced TC in non-linear fashion based on dosage (r = 21.11). Meta-regression analysis indicated a linear relationship between dose of l-carnitine and absolute change in TC (p = 0.029) and LDL-C (p = 0.013). Subgroup analyses showed that l-carnitine supplementation did not change TC, LDL-C and TG in patients under hemodialysis treatment. Intravenous l-carnitine and lower doses (>2 g/day) had no effect on TC, LDL-C and triglycerides.l-carnitine supplementation at doses above 2 g/d has favorable effects on patients'  profiles, but is modulated on participant health and route of administration.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Untreated OSA might accelerate atherosclerosis, potentially increasing the cardiovascular disease burden in patients. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between objectively measured OSA severity and the presence of subclinical systemic atherosclerosis using non-invasive measurements, including tomographic quantification of the calcium burden.A total of 2157 participants of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, who were free of structural heart disease and underwent both in-home polysomnography and chest computed tomography, were cross-sectionally analysed. Participants were divided into three groups based on the severity of OSA: no OSA (apnoea-hypopnea index [AHI]<, n=1096), mild OSA (≤AHI<15, n=700), and moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI≥15, n=361). Calcium deposits in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries were measured by the Agatston score.Participants with moderate-to-severe OSA were 1.6 times (95% CI=1.18-2.15, p=0.002) more likely to have ascending thoracic aorta calcification (aTAC≥100 units) than those without OSA, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the association between moderate-to-severe OSA and aTAC of subjects with higher epicardial  volume (EFV) was slightly stronger than that in patients without OSA and lower EFV tertile (OR=2.11; 95% CI=1.30-3.43).Severity of OSA in the general population was independently associated with subclinical systemic atherosclerosis. These findings highlight the potential importance of severe OSA, especially in subjects with higher epicardial , as a possible predictive factor for systemic atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577671>Randomized Sirolimus-based early calcineurin inhibitor reduction in liver transplantation: impact on renal function.</a></h2><p>The long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) after liver transplantation (LT) is associated with nephrotoxicity.-year follow-up data was retrieved from the randomized controlled multicenter SiLVER trial. Standard CNI-based mTOR-free immunosuppression (group A, n=264) was compared to a 50 % reduction of CNI and introduction of the mTOR inhibitor Sirolimus within 4 to 6 weeks after LT (group B, n=261).Median MELD at LT was low with 10 (7 - 15) (group A) and 11 (8 - 15) (group B) in the intention-to-treat approach. CNI dose and CNI trough were reduced by 20% and 8% (group A) versus 55% and 56% (group B) at 3 months post transplantation. Renal function was preserved at 3 months after LT in the Sirolimus arm [eGFR 74 (57-95) versus 67 (55-85) ml/min/1.73m, p=0.004] but was similarly impaired thereafter compared to group A. The per protocol analysis identified LT recipients in group B with concomitant early CNI minimization and Sirolimus treatment ≥ year 1 with significantly superior eGFR and lowest rate of chronic kidney disease (≥ stage 3) from year 1 onwards until study end. Competing risk factors for renal disease (arterial hypertension,  disorder and hyperglycemia) were not associated with worse kidney function.Prevention of CNI nephrotoxicity by Sirolimus-based early CNI minimization protects renal function only short-term after LT in the intention-to-treat analysis of this low MELD cohort.

Lauric acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and alpha-linoleic acid (ALA) were higher in AN than in controls (lauric acid: 15,081.6 ± 14,970.2 vs. 8257.4 ± 4740.2 pmol/mL; ALA at fasting: 2217.7 ± 1587.6 vs. 1087.9 ± 821.2 pmol/mL; ALA at postprandial: 1830.9 ± 1115.6 vs. 1159.4 ± 664.7 pmol/mL. EPA: 33,788.3 ± 17,487. vs. 22,860.6 ± 12,642.4 pmol/mL; DPA: 32,664.8 ± 16,215.0 vs. 20,969.0 ± 12,350.0 pmol/mL. FDR-adjusted -values < 0.05). Food intake and AN status modified the correlations of FAs with body mass index (BMI), depression, and anxiety. Desaturases SCD-18 and D6D showed lower activities in AN compared to controls. Altered FA signature, specifically correlations between elevated -3 FAs and worsened symptoms, illustrate metabolic underpinnings in AN. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms by which FA dysregulation, specifically elevated -3 FAs, affects AN risk and outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579462>Association of low-carbohydrate diet score with overweight, obesity and cardiovascular disease risk factors: a cross-sectional study in Iranian women.</a></h2><p> This study aimed to determine the association of low-carbohydrate-diet score with overweight, obesity and cardiovascular risk factors among Iranian women.  In healthy Iranian women 20-50 years, demographics, anthropometrics, physical activity, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, blood lipids, and dietary intake (using a validated food frequency questionnaire) were assessed. Participants were divided into deciles of macronutrient intakes. Women in the lowest decile of carbohydrate intake received a score of 9 and women in the highest decile received a score of 0. For protein and  intakes, women in the lowest decile received a score of 0 for that macronutrient and those in the highest decile received the score of 9. Macronutrient scores were summed to create the low-carbohydrate diet score and women were grouped into tertiles based on these scores. Continuous and qualitative variables were compared among the low-carbohydrate-diet score by one-way ANOVA and chi-square test, respectively. Logistic regression was used to determine the association of low-carbohydrate-diet score and cardiovascular risk factors.  A total of 209 women were included in the study. Socioeconomic status significantly increased from tertile 1 to 3 of the low-carbohydrate diet score ( = 0.02). Total dietary glycemic index (GI) significantly differed among tertiles (tertile 1 GI: 63.1 ±0.50, tertile 2 GI: 61.9 ± 0., tertile 3 GI: 59. ± 0.;  < 0.001). The odds ratios for overweight, obesity and cardiovascular risk factors were not significantly different among the tertiles of low-carbohydrate diet score.  In Iranian women, diets lower in carbohydrate and higher in protein and  were not associated with overweight, obesity and cardiovascular risk factors.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581520>Low Levels of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Mortality Outcomes in Non-Statin Users.</a></h2><p>We aimed to test the association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and all-cause mortality in non-statin users. A total of 347,971 subjects in Kangbuk Samsung Health Study (KSHS.57.4% men, mean follow up: .64 ± 3.27 years) were tested. To validate these associations, we analyzed data from another cohort (Korean genome and epidemiology study, KoGES, 182,943 subjects). All subjects treated with any -lowering therapy and who died during the first 3 years of follow up were excluded. Five groups were defined according to baseline LDL-C concentration (<70, 70-99, 100-129, 130-159, ≥160 mg/dL). A total of 2028 deaths occurred during follow-up in KSHS. The lowest LDL-C group (LDL < 70 mg/dL) had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.95, 1.55-2.47), CVD mortality (HR 2.02, 1.11-3.64), and cancer mortality (HR 2.06, 1.46-2.90) compared to the reference group (LDL 120-139 mg/dL). In the validation cohort, 2338 deaths occurred during follow-up. The lowest LDL-C group (LDL < 70 mg/dL) had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.81, 1.44-2.28) compared to the reference group. Low levels of LDL-C concentration are strongly and independently associated with increased risk of cancer, CVD, and all-cause mortality. These findings suggest that more attention is needed for subjects with no statin-induced decrease in LDL-C concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565881>Current Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care Clinics in Korea.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the overall status of diabetes control and screening for diabetic microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus attending primary care clinics in Korea.In this cross-sectional observational study, 191 primary care clinics were randomly selected across Korea from 2015 to 2016. In total, 3,227 subjects were enrolled in the study.The patients followed at the primary care clinics were relatively young, with a mean age of 61.4±11.7 years, and had a relatively short duration of diabetes (mean duration, 7.6±6. years). Approximately 14% of subjects had diabetic microvascular complications. However, the patients treated at the primary care clinics had suboptimal control of hemoglobin A1c levels, blood pressure, and serum  levels, along with a metabolic target achievement rate of .9% according to the Korean Diabetes Association guidelines. The screening rates for diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy within the past 12 months were 28.4%, 23.3%, and 13.3%, respectively.The overall status of diabetes management, including the frequency of screening for microvascular complications, was suboptimal in the primary care clinics. More efforts should be made and more resources need to be allocated for primary care physicians to promote adequate healthcare delivery, which would result in stricter diabetes control and improved management of diabetic complications.Copyright © 2019 Korean Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572457>Up-regulation of FTO gene expression was associated with increase in skeletal muscle mass in overweight male adolescents.</a></h2><p>The modifying effect of FTO gene expression level on change in body mass index and body composition has not been studied before. This study aimed to investigate the association between change in the expression level of the FTO gene and changes in anthropometric measurements in obese and overweight adolescent boys.Eighty-four boys aged 12 to 16 years participated in this longitudinal study. A Bio Impedance Analyzer (BIA) was used to estimate percentage of body  (%BF) and percentage of skeletal muscle (%SM). The FTO gene expression level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). All measurements were performed at baseline and after 18 weeks.After 18 weeks, mean weight was reduced by 2.39 kg, body mass index by 0.09 kg/m, %BF by 0.82% and %SM increased by 0.44%. Moreover, the level of FTO gene expression increased 0.42-fold higher than baseline. The change in expression level of the FTO gene was positively associated with change in %SM (β = 0.31,  = 0.02).FTO gene expression change was associated with change in %SM in male adolescents.

The generation of cortisol from this reaction may increase intra-abdominal cortisol levels and contribute to the physiopathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The relationship of  rs45487298 and  rs6688832 polymorphisms with obesity and MetS was studied. We also studied how  abdominal subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) gene expression is related to body  distribution.Rates of obesity and MetS features were cross-sectionally analyzed according to these polymorphisms in 1006 Brazilian white patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Additionally,  expression was analyzed in VAT and SAT in a different cohort of 28 participants with and without obesity who underwent elective abdominal operations.Although polymorphisms of the two genes were not individually associated with MetS features, a synergistic effect was observed between both. Carriers of at least three minor alleles exhibited lower BMI compared to those with two or fewer minor alleles adjusting for gender and age (27.4 ± 4.9 vs. 29.3 ± .3 kg/m; P = 0.005; mean ± SD). Obesity frequency was also lower in the first group (24.4% vs. 41.6%, OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.87; P = 0.019). In the second cohort of 28 subjects,  gene expression in VAT was inversely correlated with BMI (r = - 0.435, P = 0.034), waist circumference (r = - 0.584, P = 0.003) and waist-to-height ratio (r = - 0.526, P = 0.010).These polymorphisms might interact in the protection against obesity in T2DM individuals.

The control group (CONT) received the same volume of placebo injection (NaCl 0.9%).4-OHA treatment induced a significant accumulation of intraprostatic cholesterol (138.90 ± 17.64 vs 85.12 ± 2.87, p = 0.01); against an insignificant diminution of malondialdehyde (412.6 ± 54.35 vs 842.70 ± 336.50, p > 0.05) and glutathione (2.40 ± 0.23 vs 3.65 ± 0.88, p > 0.05). This was associated with a significant decrease of nitric oxide (31.76 ± 7.07 vs 179.40 ± 58.35, p = 0.024). Additionally, 4-OHA significantly increased the intraprostatic production of PSA-like (11.12 ± 2.78 vs 3.91 ± 0.43, p = 0.043). The prostatic histology revealed an amyloid deposition, in all prostatic lobes and a smooth muscle layer growth (p < 0.05); especially significant in the dorsal and lateral lobes. Theses lobes manifested a basal cells proliferation, with a 3-fold increase of p63 expression (p < 0.001). The ventral lobe presented epithelial atrophy (37.80 ± 16.20 vs 167.60 ± .16, p < 0.05); with occasional and significant proliferative foci (247.00 ± 9.573 vs 167.60 ± .16 p < 0.05).Aromatase inhibition, in the adult male rat, alters the prostatic function by reducing nitric oxide availability and inducing amyloid deposition along with limiting the differentiation of basal cells, through a lobe-specific p63-overexpression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut microbiota of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading microbiota such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut microbiota were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate  and amino acid  were dominant  . Lipid  was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading microbiota (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid  pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648564>Prednisone and Its Active Metabolite Prednisolone Attenuate Lipid Accumulation in Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Synthetic forms of glucocorticoids (GCs; eg, prednisone, prednisolone) are anti-inflammatory drugs that are widely used in clinical practice. The role of GCs in cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, is highly controversial, and their impact on macrophage foam cell formation is still unknown. We investigated the effects of prednisone and prednisolone on macrophage oxidative stress and lipid .C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with prednisone or prednisolone ( mg/kg) for 4 weeks, followed by lipid  analyses in the aorta and peritoneal macrophages. We also analyzed the effect of serum samples obtained from 9 healthy human volunteers before and after oral administration of prednisone (20 mg for  days) on J774A.1 macrophage atherogenicity. Finally, J774A.1 macrophages, human monocyte-derived macrophages, and fibroblasts were incubated with increasing concentrations (0-200 ng/mL) of prednisone or prednisolone, followed by determination of cellular oxidative status, and triglyceride and cholesterol . Prednisone and prednisolone treatment resulted in a significant reduction in triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, as observed in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. These effects were associated with GCs' inhibitory effect on triglyceride- and cholesterol-biosynthesis rates, through downregulation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and HMG-CoA reductase expression. Glucocorticoid-induced reduction of cellular lipid accumulation was mediated by the GC receptors on the macrophages, because the GC-receptor antagonist (RU486) abolished these effects. In fibroblasts, unlike macrophages, GCs showed no effects.Prednisone and prednisolone exhibit antiatherogenic activity by protecting macrophages from lipid accumulation and foam cell formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553895>The effects of a pre-exercise meal on post-exercise  following a session of sprint interval training.</a></h2><p>Sprint interval training (SIT) has demonstrated reductions in  mass through potential alterations in post-exercise . This study examined whether exercising in the fasted or fed state affects post-exercise  following acute SIT. Ten active males performed a bout of modified SIT (8 x 15 s sprints; 120 s recovery) in both a fasted (FAST) and fed (FED) state. Gas exchange was collected through 3 h post-exercise, appetite perceptions were measured using a visual analog scale, and energy intake was recorded using dietary food logs. There was no difference in energy expenditure between conditions at any time point (p>0.329) or in total session energy expenditure (FED: 514.8±54.9 kcal, FAST: 504.0±74.3 kcal; p=0.982).  oxidation 3 h post-exercise was higher in FED (0.110±0.04 g·min-1) versus FAST (0.069±0.02 g·min-1; p=0.013) though not different between conditions across time (p>0.340), or in total post-exercise  oxidation (FED: 0.125±0.04 g·min-1>, FAST: 0.105±0.02 g·min-1; p=0.154).

The antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX) exerts its effect by inhibiting serotonin (-HT) reuptake at the presynaptic membrane, thus increasing brain serotonergic activity. In vertebrates, there is a clear inverse relationship between hypothalamic -HT levels and food intake, therefore we hypothesized that FLX would inhibit food intake, and in consequence alter energy  in freshwater fish. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of FLX on feeding behavior and energy storage of the cichlid fish Cichlasoma dimerus. Adult fish were intraperitoneally injected daily with 2 or 20 μg.g FLX or saline for a -day period, during which the 20 μg.g FLX-injected fish exhibited a marked reduction in food intake, consistent with a decrease in total body weight and total hepatocyte area observed at the end of the experiment. Although not statistically significant, a marked 50% decrease in glycogen and  content and an increase in protein levels in liver was observed for the 20 μg.g FLX dose. This was evidenced histochemically by a weak PAS positive reaction and an intense Coomasie Blue stain. Taken together, these results suggest that the SSRI antidepressant FLX produces an anorectic effect in adults of C. dimerus, which could alter normal physiological function and, in consequence, have a negative impact on fish growth, reproduction, and population success.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the current studies, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to blue-enriched LED light at day (bLAD), compared with CWF, promotes the circadian regulation of neuroendocrine, metabolic, and physiologic parameters that are associated with optimizing homeostatic regulation of health and wellbeing in 3 mouse strains commonly used in biomedical research (C3H [melatonin-producing], C57BL/6, and BALB/c [melatonin-non-producing]). Compared with male and female mice housed for 12 wk under 12:12-h light:dark (LD) cycles in CWF light, C3H mice in bLAD evinced 6-fold higher peak plasma melatonin levels at the middark phase; in addition, high melatonin levels were prolonged 2 to 3 h into the light phase. C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains did not produce nighttime pineal melatonin. Body growth rates; dietary and water intakes; circadian rhythms of arterial blood corticosterone, insulin, leptin, glucose, and lactic acid; pO₂ and pCO₂; fatty acids; and metabolic indicators (cAMP, DNA, tissue DNA H-thymidine incorporation,  content) in major organ systems were significantly lower and activation of major metabolic signaling pathways (mTOR, GSK3β, and SIRT1) in skeletal muscle and liver were higher only in C3H mice in bLAD compared with CWF. These data show that exposure of C3H mice to bLAD compared with CWF has a marked positive effect on the circadian regulation of neuroendocrine, metabolic, and physiologic parameters associated with the promotion of animal health and wellbeing that may influence scientific outcomes.

REE by indirect calorimetry; skeletal muscle (SM), trunk organs, and brain volumes by MRI; and FFM by DXA were measured at post-surgery visits and compared with CON (N = 84) using linear regression models that adjusted for relevant covariates. Ns in RYGB were 50, 42, and 30 for anthropometry and 39, 27, 17 for MRI body composition at years 1, 2, and  after surgery, respectively.Regression models adjusted for age, weight, height, ethnicity, and sex showed REE differences (RYGB minus CON; mean ± s.e.): year 1 (43.2 ± 34 kcal/day, p = 0.20); year 2 (- 27.9 ± 37.3 kcal/day, p = 0.46); year  (114.6 ± 42.3 kcal/day, p = 0.008). Analysis of FFM components showed that RYGB had greater trunk organ mass (~ 0.4 kg) and less SM (~ 1.34 kg) than CON at each visit. REE models adjusted for FFM, SM, trunk organs, and brain mass showed no between-group differences in REE (- 15.9 ± 54.8 kcal/day, p = 0.8; - 46.9 ± 64.9 kcal/day, p = 0.47; 47.7 ± 83.0 kcal/day, p = 0.57, at years 1, 2, and , respectively).Post bariatric surgery patients maintain a larger mass of high-metabolic rate trunk organs than non-operated controls of similar anthropometrics.

The outer adrenal cortex produces steroid hormones, including glucocorticoids such as cortisol, and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone, and the androgen dehydroepiandrosterone. The glucocorticoids play a role in carbohydrate, protein, and . The mineralocorticoids are essential for the sodium (Na) and potassium (K) balance and the maintenance of fluid homeostasis. Glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are critical for survival. The inner adrenal medulla produces catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine ). Occasionally one does encounter adrenal masses during a routine study.[1] These lesions can categorize as either functional (hormone-secreting) or silent (either benign or malignant). Overall, less than 1% of these tumors are cancerous.[2] The Fourth Edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of endocrine tumors published in 2017 has classified adrenal cancer in two groups. The first includes tumors of the adrenal cortex, and the second group includes tumors of the adrenal medulla and extra-adrenal paraganglia.[3] The key feature of the WHO classification is the role of genetics that may be involved in adrenal cortical carcinoma and pheochromocytoma/ paraganglioma as well as the inclusion of a few rare malignancies of the adrenal cortex and medulla. The following are tumors of the adrenal cortex: 1. Cortical carcinoma. 2. Cortical adenoma. 3. Sex cord-stromal tumors:   Granulosa cell tumor. Leydig cell tumor.
 4. Adenomatoid tumor. . Mesenchymal and stromal tumors:   Myelolipoma. Schwannoma.
 6. Hematological tumors. 7. Secondary tumors. Adrenocortical adenoma (ACA), Adrenal myelolipoma (mesenchymal and stromal tumors) and adrenal adenomatoid tumor are benign neoplasms of the adrenal cortex. Sex cord-stromal tumor of the adrenal gland is rare, and there are only six reports in the literature.[3] Primary hematological tumors are mostly lymphomas and rarely plasmacytoma. Secondary tumors of the adrenal cortex are usually metastatic lesions due to direct infiltration by adjacent cancer or more commonly via hematogenous spread from a distant site. Adrenal metastases are common in patients with advanced cancer.[3] Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) are very uncommon; these lesions are less common than cortical adenomas and pheochromocytoma. The worldwide incidence of ACC is of 0. to 2 per 1 million people annually.[4] However, this neoplasia accounts for 0.02 to 0.2% of all cancer-related deaths.[] Adrenocortical carcinomas are very aggressive lesions and in some cases may be functional and present with Cushing syndrome and/or virilization. In most cases, ACC is non-functional and present as an abdominal mass or an incidental finding. As with all adrenal tumors, the presence of local or distant spread defines their malignancy. No absolute criteria of malignancy exist for lesions confined to the adrenal gland, but a Weiss score of 3 or higher, which is determined by histopathological features, is generally an indicator of malignancy.[6]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529091>Dietary Choline or Trimethylamine N-oxide Supplementation Does Not Influence Atherosclerosis Development in Ldlr-/- and Apoe-/- Male Mice.</a></h2><p>Choline, an essential nutrient, is required for cell membranes, lipoprotein secretion, and methyl-group .

Furthermore, some studies have shown an association between excess dietary choline, plasma TMAO concentrations, and atherosclerotic lesion size in apoE knockout (Apoe-/-) mice.The aim of this study was to further investigate the relation between dietary choline and atherosclerosis in 2 atherogenic mouse models, the LDL receptor knockout (Ldlr-/-) and Apoe-/- mice.Six feeding trials were performed in Ldlr-/- (40% high- diet) and Apoe-/- (unpurified diet) male mice, aged 8-10 wk. Mice randomly received control diet (0.1% choline), or choline- (1% choline), betaine- (0.1% choline and 0.9% betaine), or TMAO- (0.1% choline and 0.12% or 0.2% TMAO) supplemented diet for ≤28 wk. After the dietary intervention, the animals were killed and tissues and blood collected. Aortic atherosclerotic plaque area, plasma lipids, and choline metabolites were quantified.In Ldlr-/- mice, dietary supplementation for 8 wk with choline or TMAO increased plasma TMAO concentrations by 1.6- and 4-fold, respectively. After 16 wk, there was a 2-fold increase in plasma TMAO after dietary TMAO supplementation. In Apoe-/- mice, dietary supplementation with choline, betaine, or TMAO for 12 wk did not increase plasma TMAO concentrations. However, choline and TMAO supplementation for 28 wk significantly increased plasma TMAO concentrations by 1.8- and 1.-fold, respectively. Contrary to predictions, atherosclerotic lesion size was not altered by any of the dietary interventions, irrespective of mouse model.In our study, high intakes of dietary choline or TMAO supplementation did not influence atherosclerosis development in Ldlr-/- or Apoe-/- male mice.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618431>Amyotrophy Induced by a High- Diet Is Closely Related to Inflammation and Protein Degradation Determined by Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Analysis in Skeletal Muscle of C57BL/6 J Mice.</a></h2><p>Ectopic  accumulation in skeletal muscle results in dysfunction and atrophy, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a high- diet (HFD) in modulating the structure and energy  of skeletal muscle and the underlying mechanisms in mice.Four-week-old male C57BL/6 J mice (n = 30) were allowed 1 wk for acclimatization. After 6 mice with low body weight were removed from the study, the remaining 24 mice were fed with a normal- diet (NFD; 10% energy from , n = 12) or an HFD (60% energy from , n = 12) for 24 wk. At the end of the experiment, serum glucose and  concentrations were measured, and skeletal muscle was collected for atrophy analysis, inflammation measurements, and phosphoproteomic analysis.Compared with the NFD, the HFD increased (P < 0.05) body weight (35.8%), serum glucose (64.%), and  (27.3%) concentrations, along with elevated (P < 0.05) expressions of the atrophy-related proteins muscle ring finger 1 (MURF1; 27.6%) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFBX; 44.%) in skeletal muscle. Phosphoproteomic analysis illustrated 64 proteins with differential degrees of phosphorylation between the HFD and NFD groups. These proteins were mainly involved in modulating cytoskeleton [adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 2 (CAP2) and actin-α skeletal muscle (ACTA1)], inflammation [NF-κB-activating protein (NKAP) and serine/threonine-protein kinase RIO3 (RIOK3)], glucose  [Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (TRIP10); protein kinase C, and casein kinase II substrate protein 3 (PACSIN3)], and protein degradation [heat shock protein 90 kDa (HSP90AA1)]. The HFD-induced inhibitions of the insulin signaling pathway and activations of inflammation in skeletal muscle were verified by Western blot analysis.Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis in C57BL/6 J mice fed an NFD or HFD for 24 wk revealed that the phosphorylation of inflammatory proteins and proteins associated with glucose  at specific serine residues may play critical roles in the regulation of skeletal muscle atrophy induced by an HFD.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of perinatal exposure to BPA on NAFLD and its mechanisms. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats had access to drinking water containing 1 or 10 μg/ml BPA from gestational day 6 to post-natal day 21. For  weeks after weaning, offspring drank normal water without BPA. Body weight,  profile and the expression of genes or proteins involved in mTOR mediated  and autophagy, as well as inflammatory response were investigated in the 8-wk-old offspring of different genders. The results showed that body weight was increased only in females, however, males, and females from dams treated with BPA had significantly excess visceral adipose tissue, which was consistent with adipocyte hypertrophy. Elevated TG levels and up-regulation of lipogenic genes or proteins in liver, such as sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were consistent with increased liver  droplets in offspring exposed to BPA. Compared with controls, the protein levels of InsR, p-IRS-1, IRS-1, TSC1, and TSC2 were decreased, p-PI3K, p-Akt (S473), p-Akt (T308), p-mTOR, and mTOR were increased, and the impaired autophagic degradation was evidenced by increased protein levels of p62, although the levels of p-ULK1, Beclin1, and LC3B proteins were increased in liver of BPA-exposed offspring. The levels of TLR4 and NF-κB proteins were also significantly increased, and ERα protein was significantly decreased in BPA-exposed offspring. Our findings indicate that perinatal exposure to BPA causes the development of NAFLD in both female and male offspring, which is associated with up-regulation of lipogenic genes, dysregulated autophagy and activated inflammatory response involving the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and TLR4/NF-κB pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607935>A Network Pharmacology Study of the Multi-Targeting Profile of an Antiarrhythmic Chinese Medicine Xin Su Ning.</a></h2><p>Xin Su Ning (XSN) is a China patented and certified traditional Chinese herbal medicine used to treat premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) since 2005. XSN is formulated with 11 herbs, designed to treat arrhythmia with phlegm-heat heart-disturbed syndrome (PHHD) according to Chinese medicine theory. The rational compatibility of the 11 herbs decides the therapeutic outcome of XSN. Due to the multicomponent nature of traditional Chinese medicine, it is difficult to use conventional pharmacology to interpret the therapeutic mechanism of XSN in terms of clear-cut drug molecule and target interactions. Network pharmacology/systematic pharmacology usually consider all the components in a formula with the same weight; therefore, the proportion of the weight of the components has been ignored. In the present study, we introduced a novel coefficient to mimic the relative amount of all the components in relation with the weight of the corresponding herb in the formula. The coefficient is also used to weigh the pharmacological effect of XSN on all relative biological pathways. We also used the cellular electrophysiological data generated in our lab, such as the effect of liensinine and isoliquiritigenin on Na1. channels; we therefore set sodium channel as one of the targets of these two components, which would support the clinical efficacy of XSN in treating tachyarrhythmia. Combining the collected data and our discovery, a panoramagram of the pharmacological mechanism of XSN was established. Pathway enrichment and analysis showed that XSN treated PHHD arrhythmia through multiple ion channels regulation, protecting the heart from I/R injury, inhibiting the apoptosis of cardiomyocyte, and improving glucose and .Copyright © 2019 Wang, Streeter, Wang, Purnama, Lyu, Carr and Ma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611038>Effects of tesamorelin on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in HIV: a randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a substantial cause of comorbidity in people with HIV and there are no proven pharmacological treatments for the disease in this population. We assessed the effects of tesamorelin on liver  and histology in people with HIV and NAFLD.This randomised, double-blind, multicentre study with identical placebo as a comparator was done in a hospital and a medical research centre in the USA. People with HIV infection and a hepatic  fraction (HFF) of % or more by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either tesamorelin 2 mg once daily or placebo once daily for 12 months, followed by a 6-month open-label phase during which all participants received tesamorelin 2 mg daily. The randomisation list was prepared by the study statistician using a permuted block algorithm within each stratum with randomly varying block sizes. The primary endpoint was change in HFF between baseline and 12 months. The primary safety endpoint was glucose. Analysis was by intention to treat using all available data. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .61 patients were enrolled between Aug 20, 2015, and Jan 16, 2019, of whom 30 received tesamorelin and 30 received placebo. Patients receiving tesamorelin had a greater reduction of HFF than did patients receiving placebo, with an absolute effect size of -4·1% (95% CI -7·6 to -0·7, p=0·018), corresponding to a -37% (95% CI -67 to -7, p=0·016) relative reduction from baseline. After 12 months, 35% of individuals receiving tesamorelin and 4% receiving placebo had a HFF of less than % (p=0·0069). Changes in fasting glucose and glycated haemoglobin were not different between groups at 12 months. Individuals in the tesamorelin group experienced more localised injection site complaints than those in the placebo group, though none were judged to be serious.Tesamorelin might be beneficial in people with HIV and NAFLD.

Recent studies indicate that  transfer from plants is essential for AM fungal colonization; however, the role of  transfer in arbuscule formation and the dynamics of  accumulation in arbuscules under low pH stress are far from well understood. In the symbiosis of tomato and Rhizophagus intraradices under contrasting pH conditions (pH 4. vs. pH 6.), we investigated arbuscule formation, nutrient uptake, alkaline phosphatase activity and  accumulation; examined the gene expression involved in phosphate transport,  biosynthesis and transfer and sugar ; and visualized the  dynamics in arbuscules. Low pH greatly inhibited arbuscule formation, in parallel with reduced phospholipid fatty acids accumulation in AM fungus and decreased P uptake. This reduction was supported by the decreased expression of plant genes encoding  biosynthesis and transfer. More degenerating arbuscules were observed under low pH conditions, and neutral  fatty acids accumulated only in degenerating arbuscules. These data reveal that, under low pH stress, reduced  transfer from hosts to AM fungi is responsible for the inhibited arbuscule formation.© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583253>Antidiabetic Effect of Fenugreek Seed Powder Solution (.) on Hyperlipidemia in Diabetic Patients.</a></h2><p>Many drugs are commercially available for use in the management of diabetes.

Methods L02 cells were infected with lentivirus expressing SIRT1 shRNA to knockdown SIRT1 expression. Wild-type and SIRT1-knockdown L02 cells were treated with 250 mol/L palmitate for  days, and then administrated with 1 g/ml FGF21 for 72 hours. Triglycerides in the cells were detected with the infinity triglycerides reagent. Malondialdehyde (MDA) in the cells was assessed by MDA detection assay. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in supernatant were measured by ELISA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were tested by the specific Amplex red ROS detection assay kit from Thermo Fisher Company. The gene expression of SIRT1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase (CAT) were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. The protein levels of SIRT1, PGC1α, SOD2 and CAT were detected by Western blot analysis. Mitochondrial membrane potentials were detected by the JC-1staining kit. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was detected with the Seahorse XF Mito stress test kit. Results Palmitate increased the triglycerides level, induced the oxidative stress in both the cells and the mitochondria, decreased the gene expression and protein levels of SIRT1, PGC1α, SOD2 and CAT, increased the levels of TNF-α and IL-6, decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, and impaired the mitochondrial function. FGF21 treatment could attenuate all of these effects caused by palmitate, while SIRT1 knockdown blocked most of the FGF21 effects on the L02 hepatocytes. Conclusion FGF21 activates SIRT1 pathway and inhibites the  accumulation, improves the mitochondrial function, and decreases the oxidative stress as well as inflammation in palmitate-treated L02 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667423>High  diet modulates the protein content of nutrient transporters in the small intestine of mice: possible involvement of PKA and PKC activity.</a></h2><p>Chronic high  consumption has been shown to modulate nutrient transporter content in the intestine of obese mice; however it is unclear if this regulation occurs before or after the establishment of obesity, and the underlying molecular mechanism requires elucidation.Towards this goal C57BL/6 mice were fed a low  diet (LFD) or high  diet (HFD), and specific protein and gene expression levels were assessed for up to 12 weeks. Similar experiments were also performed with leptin-deficient (Ob/Ob) mice.The results showed that the HFD group presented decreased GLUT2, PEPT1, /CD36 and NPC1L1, and increased NHE3, MTTP and L-FABP content. Animals fed an HFD also presented enhanced  transporter gene expression of , , ,  and . Additionally, /CD36 and NPC1L1 protein levels were reduced in both HFD-induced obese and Ob/Ob mice. Ob/Ob mice also exhibited increased  and  mRNAs expression, but the protein expression levels remained unchanged. The HFD also attenuated PKA and PKC activities. The inhibition of PKA was associated with decreased /CD36 content, whereas increased L-FABP levels likely depend on CREB activation, independent of PKA. It is plausible that the HFD-induced changes in NPC1L1, MTTP and L-FABP protein content involve regulation at the level of transcription. Moreover, the changes in GLUT2 and PEPT1 content might be associated with low PKC activity.The results indicated that an HFD is capable of reducing nutrient transporter content, possibly attenuating nutrient uptake into the intestine, and may represent a feedback mechanism for regulating body weight. Furthermore, the elevated levels of NHE3, L-FABP and MTTP may account for the increased prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia in obese individuals. All of these changes are potentially linked to reduced PKA or PKC activities.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624042>Design, synthesis and evaluation of -(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione-Based fibrates as potential hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective agents.</a></h2><p>Six novel target compounds -(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (ADT) based fibrates were synthesized and evaluated.

In our previous study, we showed that alcohol-induced increase in serum ghrelin levels impair insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. The consequent reduction in the circulating insulin levels promote adipose-derived fatty acid mobilization to ultimately contribute to hepatic steatosis. In this study, we determined whether inhibition of ghrelin activity in chronic alcohol-fed rats could improve hepatic  homeostasis at the pancreas-adipose-liver axis. Adult Wistar rats were fed Lieber-DeCarli control or an ethanol liquid diet for 7 weeks. At 6 weeks, a subset of rats in each group were injected with either saline or ghrelin receptor antagonist, [d-Lys-3] GHRP-6 (DLys; 9 mg/kg body weight) for  days and all rats were sacrificed 2 days later. DLys treatment of ethanol rats improved pancreatic insulin secretion, normalized serum insulin levels, and the adipose , as evidenced by the decreased serum free fatty acids (FFA). DLys treatment of ethanol rats also significantly decreased the circulating FFA uptake, de novo hepatic fatty acid synthesis ultimately attenuating alcoholic steatosis. To summarize, inhibition of ghrelin activity reduced alcoholic steatosis by improving insulin secretion, normalizing serum insulin levels, inhibiting adipose lipolysis, and preventing fatty acid uptake and synthesis in the liver. Our studies provided new insights on the important role of ghrelin in modulating the pancreas-adipose-liver, and promoting adipocyte lipolysis and hepatic steatosis.

Extensive NEB, as common in high-yielding transitioning ruminants, drives significant metabolic disturbance and pathologies such as pregnancy toxemia and ketosis. Strategies to minimize the severity of NEB include the use of energy-dense feed supplements, like glycerol and propylene glycol (PG), or IV glucose infusion during severe hypoglycemia. PG and glycerol have been studied mainly by oral or ruminal administration, which exposes them to substantial  in the digestive system. To investigate their direct benefits to mitigating NEB, we intravenously infused them into sheep induced into NEB by feed restriction. Sixteen -month-old ewe lambs at NEB were IV-treated with 170 mL isotonic saline containing 15% glycerol or 15% PG. Both PG and glycerol effectively reduced hyperketonemia by 57% and 61%, and inhibited adipose lipolysis by 73.6% and 73.3%, respectively. Surprisingly, only glycerol was glucogenic (p < 0.0001) and insulinotropic (p < 0.0075), while PG was primarily utilized for production of lactate (p < 0.0001). Tissue-damage biomarkers indicated hemolytic activity for PG. This study revealed glycerol as a superior IV treatment for effective relief of NEB. Since it carries no risk of glucose overloading, glycerol IV infusion may also have clinical advantages over glucose for treatment of pregnancy toxemia and ketosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646566>STAT5A reprograms fatty acid  and promotes tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine the underlying effect of STAT5A-mediated fatty acid  on the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells.The expression patterns of STAT5A and FASN in gastric cancer were investigated based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and compared between 40 pairs of cancer samples and adjacent tissues. The pathological significance of STAT5A in gastric cancer was explored by GESA assay, and the molecular mechanism of STAT5A-mediated FASN expression was investigated by Luciferase assay and ChIP-qPCR. Fatty acid metabolic change was explored by detecting the content of neutral , triglycerides, and phospholipids in STAT5A silenced MKN28 and AGS cells.

These osteoporotic conditions are associated with oxidative stress and hyperglycemia which are both considered as critical factors underlying bone fragility. Glucose excess and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to favor adipogenesis over osteoblastogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether high glucose exposure could determine dysfunction of mature BMAds, specifically through ROS production. The effects of low (LG,  mM) or high glucose (HG, 25 mM) concentrations were examined using human bone mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) in the time course of differentiation, and, up to 21 days once adipocytes were mature. HG did not alter the adipocyte differentiation process of hBMSCs. Yet, after 21 days under HG exposure, , and adiponectin mRNA expressions were decreased. These alterations were also observed following adipogenic inducer withdrawal as well as in adipocytes fully differentiated in LG then cultured in HG for the last 11 days. Without inducers, HG condition also led to decreased leptin mRNA level. Importantly, intracellular and extracellular ROS concentrations measured using Amplex Red were significantly raised by 50% under HG exposure. This rise was observed once adipocytes ended differentiation and was reproduced within the different cell culture settings without any cytotoxicity. Among genes involved in ROS , the mRNA level of the HO generating enzyme NOX4 was found upregulated in the presence of HG. Following cell separation, mature BMAds were shown to overproduce ROS and to display the gene alterations in contrast to non--laden cells. Finally, a non-lethal treatment with a pro-oxidant agent under LG condition reduces the mRNA levels of , adiponectin, and leptin as the HG condition does in the absence of inducers, and amplifies the effect of glucose excess on gene expression. HG concentration drives mature BMAds toward altered expression of the main adipokines and transcriptional factors. These perturbations are associated with a rise in ROS generation likely mediated through enhanced expression of . Mature BMAds are thus responsive to changes in glucose and ROS concentrations, which is relevant regarding with their phenotype and function in age- or metabolic disease-related osteoporosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609072>Avocatin B Protects Against Lipotoxicity and Improves Insulin Sensitivity in Diet-Induced Obesity.</a></h2><p>The effects of an avocado-derived fatty acid oxidation (FAO) inhibitor, avocatin B (AvoB), on glucose and  in models of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and in vitro models of lipotoxicity are evaluated.

Fibroblast growth factors, FGF19 and FGF21, are involved in  and carbohydrate . The aim of the study was to examine the concentrations of FGF19 and FGF21 in patients with CKD, as well as the correlation between FGF19 and FGF21 and selected biochemical parameters.The study included 178 subjects: 52 patients with CKD in stages 2-4, without haemodialysis (CKD), 47 haemodialysed patients with CKD (HD), 56 patients with CKD after a renal transplantation (Tx) and 23 healthy subjects as the control group (C).The highest FGF19 serum concentrations were observed in CKD patients and the lowest were observed in the Tx group. Patients in the CKD group had significantly higher serum FGF21 concentrations. There were negative correlations between FGF19 and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as well as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients after kidney transplantation. Negative correlations were also found between serum FGF21 concentrations and GFR in patients after Tx, while positive correlations were observed between FGF21 concentrations and lean body mass in the CKD group, body mass index and total cholesterol in the HD group.Our results suggest that increased concentrations of FGF19 and FGF21 in patients with CKD may be associated with the  of lipids and carbohydrates. Our results also indicate that haemodialysis and transplantation results in the reduction of FGF19 and FGF21 concentrations in patients with CKD.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

It is a progesterone receptor agonist, and as such, can act primarily in the brain and reproductive organs of fish. In order to better understand and predict its effects, this work evaluates the lipidomic changes induced in PLHC-1 cells after exposure to drospirenone at concentrations below the EC (1 and 10 μM) by direct injection of the  extracts into a ESI(+/-) Orbitrap mass spectrometer. A significant accumulation of triacylglycerides, particularly long chain ones with unsaturated fatty acid moieties (TGs 46:2, 56:4-7; 58:-8) and a concomitant decrease of diacylglycerides (DGs 32:1, 34:1-2, 36:1-2, 38:2-4) was observed after 48 h exposure to 10 μM DRO, which corresponded to an intracellular concentration of 8.3 ng·mg protein. No significant alteration of PLHC-1 cell lipids was observed following exposure to 1 μM DRO. EC for the cytotoxicity of DRO ranged from 105 to 119 μM (24 h exposure) to 51-58 μM (48 h exposure). The study evidences a dysregulation of neutral  and increased TG/DG ratio in fish hepatic cells exposed to DRO.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Fish (initial body weight 13.38 ± 0.11 g) were fed three isonitrogenous semi-purified diets containing %, 10%, and 20% , respectively. The results indicated that fish fed 10%  diet showed significantly better final body weight, specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared with that fed %  diet. Meanwhile, fish fed 20%  diet had a significantly higher viscera ratio (VR), hepatosomatic index (HSI), intraperitoneal  ratio (IPF), and liver  content than those fed the other diets. Higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) activities, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), free fatty acids (FFA), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) contents, and LDL-C/HDL-C value in plasma were recorded in fish fed 20%  diet, while higher insulin contents were obtained in fish fed %  diet. In addition, the highest carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activities in the liver were also observed in fish fed 20%  diet. However, fish fed 20%  diet had a significantly lower superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and higher MDA contents in liver than those fed the other diets. The higher nitric oxide (NO) contents and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity in liver were recorded in fish fed 10%  diet. Moreover, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and lysozyme activities, and nitric oxide (NO) contents in plasma were higher in fish fed the 10% diets than the other groups.

HFD was administrated for 2 weeks for the rats in advance and SiNPs were supplied every 3 d for 48 d subsequently. The present study illustrated that both HFD and SiNPs could decrease sperm concentration, mobility rates, increase abnormality rates, damage testicular structure, reduce spermatogonium numbers and spermatoblast numbers, reduce ATP levels, and affect expression of regulatory factors for meiosis in testis. HFD and SiNPs further damaged the sperm and lowered the ATP level and expression of factors associated with meiotic signaling pathway compared with the HFD without SiNPs in testicular tissue of Wistar rats. These results suggested that SiNPs significantly promoted reproductive toxicity induced by HFD in Wistar rats, which provides novel experimental evidence and an explanation for magnified reproductive toxicity triggered by SiNPs in HFD rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

NEGT4 contained 7 mg of drug in 10% w/w distilled water, 30% w/w surfactant (Labrafil M) and cosurfactant (Transcutol P) mixture in ratio 1:4 and 60 % Capryol 90 as oily phase thickened with 98.9 mg ethyl cellulose (20 cps). In vivo studies were carried out on male Wistar rats following standard guidelines. Scopolamine was used to induce amnesia in rats which is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Various formulations were compared by performing pharmacokinetic, histopathological, behavioural and biochemical studies on rats. Stability studies on nanoemulsion gels were carried out in accordance with The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines.Pharmacokinetic studies exhibited significantly greater extent of absorption from NEGT4 in comparison to capsule and hydrogel with a 2.18 & .26-fold increase respectively. Significant improvement in neurobehavioral parameters was observed with NEGT4 in scopolamine-induced amnesic rats. Biochemical assessment showed superior anti-amnesic activity of NEGT4 through augmentation of antioxidant enzymes, decreased  peroxidation & acetylcholinesterase activity. Low value of serum aminotransferase in rats treated with NEGT4 indicated absence of hepatotoxicity. NEGT4 was found to be non-irritant and possessed a shelf life of 4.11 years.Developed nanoemulsion gel of tacrine hydrochloride was found to be safe, stable, and efficacious and has immense potential to be used in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663569>Daily consumption of fruit-flavored yoghurt enriched with vitamins B contributes to lower energy intake and body weight reduction, in type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Yoghurt naturally contains vitamins of B-complex which play a central role in energy . This study investigates the effects of consumption of yoghurt enriched with vitamins B, in comparison with conventional yoghurt, on body weight management and glycemic control of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Thirty-three overweight/obese patients (BMI 27-36 kg m-2) were randomized into two groups receiving two servings of non- yoghurt per day, either strawberry-flavored enriched with vitamins B1, B5 and B6 (VY) or conventional (CY) for 12 weeks. At the beginning and the end of the dietary intervention, anthropometric characteristics, biochemical parameters, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b), vitamins B and homocysteine concentrations were determined.

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects  in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis.

The aim of this study was to examine the associations of short- and long-term regional ambient and near-roadway air pollution (NRAP) exposures on adiposity and cardiometabolic health in young adults aged 17-22 years.From 2014 to 2018, a subset of participants (n = 158) were recruited from the Children's Health Study to participate in the Meta-AIR (Metabolic and Asthma Incidence Research) study to assess obesity (body composition and abdominal adiposity) and cardiometabolic health (fasting glucose, fasting insulin and  profiles) measures. Prior 1-month and 1-year average air pollution exposures were calculated from residential addresses. This included nitrogen dioxide (NO), ozone (O), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 μm (PM), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2. μm (PM) and NRAP (freeway, non-freeway, and total nitrogen oxides (NO)) exposures. Linear regression models examined associations of prior 1-month (short-term) and 1-year (long-term) air pollution exposures on obesity and cardiometabolic factors adjusting for covariates and past childhood air pollution exposures.In the Meta-AIR study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis with short- and long-term regional ambient and NRAP exposures (in both single- and multi-pollutant models) and obesity- and cardiometabolic-related outcomes and found associations with a few outcomes. A 1 standard deviation (SD) change in long-term NO exposure was associated with a 11.3 mg/dL higher level of total cholesterol (p = 0.04) and 9.4 mg/dL higher level of low-density lipoproteins (LDL)-cholesterol (p = 0.04). Amongst obese participants, associations between long-term NO and total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were 4. and 9 times larger than the associations in non-obese participants (p = 0.008 and 0.03, respectively). Additionally, we observed a statistically significant association with increased short-term O exposure and higher triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels (p = 0.04), lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (p = 0.03), and higher hepatic  levels (p = 0.02). Amongst glucose-related factors, long-term PM exposure was associated with higher levels of insulin area under the curve (p = 0.03). There were no other statistically significant associations with short- or long-term air pollutants and BMI, other measures of adiposity, and cardiometabolic outcomes.Higher exposure to regional air pollutants, namely prior 1-year average NO, was associated with higher fasting serum  measures. These associations were more pronounced in obese participants, suggesting obesity may exacerbate the effects of air pollution exposure on  levels in young adults. This study did not find any other associations between short- and long-term ambient and NRAP exposures across a range of other obesity and cardiometabolic indicators.

We previously identified a series of indole-based OXE receptor antagonists that rapidly appear in the blood following oral administration but have limited lifetimes. The objective of this study was to increase the potency and plasma half-lives of these compounds and thereby identify the optimal candidate for future preclinical studies in monkeys, since rodents do not have an OXE receptor ortholog.We synthesized a series of substituted phenylalkyl indoles and compared their antagonist potencies, pharmacokinetics, and  to those of our earlier compounds. The potencies of some of their metabolites were also investigated.Among the compounds tested, the S-enantiomer of the m-chlorophenyl compound (S-Y048) was the most potent, with an pIC of about 10.8 for inhibition of -oxo-ETE-induced calcium mobilization in human neutrophils. When administered orally to cynomolgus monkeys, S-Y048 rapidly appeared in the blood and had a half-life in plasma of over 7 h, considerably longer than any of the other OXE analogs tested. A major hydroxylated metabolite, with a potency close to that of its precursor, was identified in plasma.Because of its highly potent antagonist activity and its long lifetime in vivo, S-Y048 may be a useful anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of eosinophilic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.This article is protected by copyright.

Given that approximately 50% of pregnancies are unplanned, alcohol has the potential to affect fetal development and program chronic disease in offspring. We examined the effect of an acute but moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on glucose ,  levels and dietary preference in adolescent and/or adult rat offspring. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received an oral gavage of ethanol (1 g kg maternal body weight, n = 9 dams) or an equivalent volume of saline (control, n = 8 dams) at embryonic days 13. and 14.. PAE resulted in a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05-0.06% 1 h post-gavage in dams. Fasting blood glucose concentration was not affected by PAE in offspring at any age, nor were blood glucose levels during a glucose tolerance test (GTT) in 6-month old offspring (P > 0.). However, there was evidence of insulin resistance in PAE male offspring at 6 months of age, with significantly elevated fasting plasma insulin (P = 0.001), a tendency for increased first phase insulin secretion during the GTT and impaired glucose clearance following an insulin challenge (P = 0.007). This was accompanied by modest alterations in protein kinase B (AKT) signalling in adipose tissue. PAE also resulted in reduced calorie consumption by offspring compared to controls (P = 0.04). These data suggest that a relatively low-level, acute PAE programs metabolic dysfunction in offspring in a sex-specific manner. These results highlight that alcohol consumption during pregnancy has the potential to affect the long-term health of offspring. This article is protected by copyright.

The kinase RIPK4 and the transcription factor IRF6 are mutated in severe developmental syndromes in humans, and mice lacking these genes display epidermal hyperproliferation and soft-tissue fusions that result in neonatal lethality. Our understanding of how these genes control epidermal differentiation is incomplete. Here we show that the role of RIPK4 in mouse development requires its kinase activity; that RIPK4 and IRF6 expressed in the epidermis regulate the same biological processes; and that the phosphorylation of IRF6 at Ser413 and Ser424 primes IRF6 for activation. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), histone chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of skin in wild-type and IRF6-deficient mouse embryos, we define the transcriptional programs that are regulated by IRF6 during epidermal differentiation. IRF6 was enriched at bivalent promoters, and IRF6 deficiency caused defective expression of genes that are involved in the  of lipids and the formation of tight junctions. Accordingly, the  composition of the stratum corneum of Irf6 skin was abnormal, culminating in a severe defect in the function of the epidermal barrier. Collectively, our results explain how RIPK4 and IRF6 function to ensure the integrity of the epidermis and provide mechanistic insights into why developmental syndromes that are characterized by orofacial, skin and genital abnormalities result when this axis goes awry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576242>Effects of  strain JMC-01 on the physiology, biochemistry, and mortality of  Q-biotype nymphs.</a></h2><p> is an entomopathogenic fungi, which was isolated from insects suffering from disease.

The identification of new effective biological markers for AMI is a prerequisite for treatment. Most proteomic studies have focused on atherosclerotic plaques, vascular cells, monocytes and platelets in the blood; however, the concentration of these factors in plasma is low, making it difficult to measure the complexity of plasma components. Moreover, some studies have examined the plasma protein of patients with acute coronary syndrome with histochemistry; however, the results are not consistent. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the differential proteins in the plasma of patients with AMI via proteomics to identify new biomarkers of AMI.In this study, immunodepletion of high-abundance plasma proteins followed by an isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyze plasma samples from  control individuals and 10 AMI patients.Four hundred sixty-eight proteins were identified from two samples, and 33 proteins were differentially expressed in AMI patients compared to the controls. Among the 33 proteins, 12 proteins showed a ≥1.-fold change between AMI and control samples. These proteins included fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3, ratio =6.36), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB ratio =4.89), adenylate kinase1 (AK1 ratio =4.16), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP ratio =3.29), creatine kinase (CK ratio =2.88), platelet factor 4 (PF4 ratio =2.62), peptidyl prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A (PPIA ratio =2.05), Cofilin-1 (CFL1 ratio =1.81), coronin1A (CORO1A ratio =1.71), protein kinase M (PKM ratio =1.63), ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1, ratio =1.67), and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI1 ratio =1.56). By contrast, there was a decrease of 19 proteins, such as adiponectin (ADIPOQ ratio =0.70), insulin-like growth factor binding protein6 (IGFBP6 ratio =0.70), Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3 ratio =0.70) and complement 4B (C4B ratio =0.68). The most over-represented term was regulation of cell proliferation in the cellular component category of Gene Ontology (GO). The top 3 biological process terms were regulation of cell proliferation, response to wounding and wound healing. These proteins included immune proteins, blood coagulation proteins, lipid  proteins, cytoskeleton proteins, energy  proteins, gene regulation proteins, myocutaneous proteins, and myocardial remodeling proteins and were highly connected with each other, which indicates that the functional network of these processes contribute to the pathophysiology of AMI.In conclusion, the present quantitative proteomic study identified novel AMI biomarker candidates and might provide fundamental information for the development of an AMI biomarker.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg.  segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow ) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±.9yrs, BMI: 29.±.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle  was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily energy expenditure, hypertension and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis.  from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone  and mesenchymal cell commitment to  within patients with osteoporosis. This article is protected by copyright.

To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or  were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of - and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal  alters circulating  metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate  by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and  in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient  in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

We analyzed the clinical data from 1421 T2DM inpatients at Wuhan Union Hospital. Subjects were divided into early-onset T2DM group (diagnostic age <40 years) and late-onset T2DM group (diagnostic age >40 years). All subjects underwent a standardized assessment of microvascular complications. Data were compared with independent-samples t test or Chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors of microvascular complications. Patients with early-onset T2DM were more inclined to have a lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), a longer duration of diabetes and higher levels of body mass index (BMI), uric acid (UA), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC)- triglyceride (TG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) than those with late-onset T2DM (P<0.05). The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) was significantly higher and that of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was significantly lower in early-onset group than in late-onset group (P<0.05). For DN, UA was an independent risk factor in early-onset T2DM. SBP and TG were independent risk factors in late-onset T2DM. For DR, duration of diabetes and SBP were independent risk factors in early-onset T2DM. Duration of diabetes, SBP and HbA1c were independent risk factors in late-onset T2DM. This study demonstrated that the clinical characteristics of early-onset T2DM were metabolic disorders, including glucose ,  and amino acid . Early-onset T2DM was more likely to be associated with DR. The potential pathogenesis of early and late-onset T2DM might be different. The management of metabolic risk factors especially HbA1c, SBP, TG and UA is advised to be performed in the early stage of diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666412>[Protective effect of uridine on metabolic processes in rat myocardum during its ischemia/reperfusion damage].</a></h2><p>The experimental study of the cardioprotective effect of uridine, the metabolic precursor of the endogenous activator of mitochondrial ATP-dependent K+-channels (mitoKATP-channels), was performed using the model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/RP) in rats. Ischemia for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 120 min resulted in a significant decrease in ATP and phosphocreatine (PC) content, intensification of  peroxidation (LPO), and inhibition of the antioxidant system (AOS) in cardiomyocytes. Uridine in a dose of 30 mg/kg, administered intravenously prior to reperfusion, had a protective effect on myocardial  in the I/RP zone. It prevented the decrease of ATP and PC, limited the LPO processes, evaluated by the content of  hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes, and improved the AOS state by, preventing the decrease of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and increasing the content of reduced glutathione (GSH). The mitoKATP-channel blocker -hydroxydecanoate (-HD,  mg/kg) eliminated the ability of uridine to maintain the ATP level and to exhibit its positive effect on the intensity of the LPO and activity of AOS. The obtained data allow us to conclude that activation of mitoKATP-channels play an important role in the mechanism of the cardioprotective effect of uridine in I/RP damage of myocardium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594827>Distinct Gut Microbiota Induced by Different -to-Sugar-Ratio High-Energy Diets Share Similar Pro-obesity Genetic and Metabolite Profiles in Prediabetic Mice.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota play important roles in host , especially in diabetes. However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different -to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic acid, cholestan-3-ol (β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different -to-sugar ratios can both cause obesity and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions. The microbial metabolites in common between the diets modulate  accumulation and macrophage inflammation  and  This work suggests that studies that only use 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine how the microbes respond to diet and associate with diabetic state are missing vital information.Copyright © 2019 Shan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611881>The Metabolic Requirements of Th2 Cell Differentiation.</a></h2><p>Upon activation, naïve CD4 T cells differentiate into a number of specialized T helper (Th) cell subsets. Th2 cells are central players in immunity to helminths and are implicated in mediating the inflammatory pathology associated with allergies. The differentiation of Th2 cells is dependent on transcription factors such as GATA3 and STAT6, which prime Th2 cells for the secretion of interleukin- (IL-) 4, IL-, and IL-13. Several lines of work now suggest that differentiating Th2 cells in the lymph node are potent IL-4 cytokine producers, but do not become competent IL-- and IL-13-producing cells until after receiving cues from non-lymphoid tissue. It is evident that Th2 cells that enter tissues undergo considerable changes in chromatin architecture and gene expression, and that over this time, the metabolic requirements of these cells change considerably. Herein, we discuss the metabolic requirements of Th2 cells during their early and late differentiation, focusing on the impact of glucose and , mTOR activation, the nuclear receptor PPAR-γ and several metabolites.Copyright © 2019 Stark, Tibbitt and Coquet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535025>Mitochondrial protein import is regulated by p17/PERMIT to mediate  and cellular stress.</a></h2><p>How  is regulated at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) for transducing stress signaling remains largely unknown. We show here that this process is controlled by trafficking of ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the OMM by a previously uncharacterized p17, which is now renamed protein that mediates ER-mitochondria trafficking (PERMIT). Data revealed that p17/PERMIT associates with newly translated CerS1 on the ER surface to mediate its trafficking to the OMM. Cellular stress induces Drp1 nitrosylation/activation, releasing p17/PERMIT to retrieve CerS1 for its OMM trafficking, resulting in mitochondrial ceramide generation, mitophagy and cell death. In vivo, CRISPR-Cas9-dependent genetic ablation of p17/PERMIT prevents acute stress-mediated CerS1 trafficking to OMM, attenuating mitophagy in p17/PERMIT mice, compared to controls, in various metabolically active tissues, including brain, muscle, and pancreas. Thus, these data have implications in diseases associated with accumulation of damaged mitochondria such as cancer and/or neurodegeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615167>Are Circulating Mg Levels Associated with Glucose Tolerance Profiles and Incident Type 2 Diabetes?</a></h2><p>Magnesium (Mg) is an enzyme co-factor that plays a key role in many biochemical reactions, as well as in glucose . Clinical evidences have demonstrated that depletion of serum Mg increases exponentially with the duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Diabetes is associated with low Mg, and hypomagnesemia is associated with insulin resistance, inflammation, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. In subjects at high risk of inflammation and insulin resistance, supplementation of Mg alone ameliorates both phenotypes, slowing the development and progression of hepatic steatosis. We analyze the relationship between serum Mg levels and the onset of T2DM in a large cohort of well-characterized adult white individuals participating in the CATAMERI study, who were reexamined after a mean follow-up of .6 ± 0.9 years. In our analysis we acquired a significant negative correlation between Mg levels, fasting glucose, and 2h-post load glucose in subjects who underwent an OGTT. Moreover, Mg levels correlated negatively with fasting insulin levels, and positively with the  profile. As for the detrimental effect of lower circulating Mg levels, our data revealed a significant reduction of T2DM risk of about 20% for each 1 mg/dL increase of circulating Mg. The present results are consistent with the theory that Mg supplementation could ameliorate insulin sensitivity reducing the risk to develop T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623832>The saturated fatty acid palmitate induces insulin resistance through Smad3-mediated down-regulation of FNDC5 in myotubes.</a></h2><p>Elevated plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels are associated with insulin resistance and can cause lipotoxicity in skeletal muscles. In response to FFAs, skeletal muscle can secrete a variety of cytokines. Irisin, one such muscle-secreted cytokine, can improve glucose tolerance, glucose uptake, and . It is produced by the transmembrane protein fibronectin type Ⅲ domain containing  (FNDC5) by specific proteases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the FNDC5 response to palmitate and their relationships with insulin resistance in C2C12 myotubes. RNA sequencing analysis results from C2C12 myotubes treated with palmitate showed that palmitate could activate the TGF-β signaling pathway. Palmitate directly affected the expression of Smad3, but not its phosphorylation level, in C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, knockdown and knockout of Smad3 alleviated the inhibitory effect of palmitate on the expression of FNDC5. In contrast, overexpression of Smad3 aggravated the inhibition of FNDC5 expression. There is a Smad3 binding motif in the -660 bp to -649 bp region of the Fndc5 promoter. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of this region also alleviated the inhibition of FNDC5 expression in response to palmitate. More importantly, inhibition of FNDC5 expression mediated by Smad3 led to a decrease in insulin sensitivity in C2C12 myotubes. Collectively, these findings suggest that palmitate could induce insulin resistance through Smad3-mediated down-regulation of the Fndc5 gene.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

After year 1, patients could enter the all-evolocumab period and receive evolocumab + SOC for an additional 4 years. The authors analyzed the persistence of lipid effects and exposure-dependent safety focusing on yearly rates of adverse events (AEs) and anti-drug antibodies over 4.951 patient-years of observation.A total of 1,255 patients (safety analysis population) randomized into the year 1 SOC-controlled period and received ≥1 evolocumab dose (mean ± SD age 57 ± 12 years; 53% female). A total of 1,151 patients (efficacy analysis population) progressed to the all-evolocumab period (year 2 and beyond).

The present analysis uses a summative multisystem index of biologic risk, known as allostatic load (AL), to evaluate whether the overall balance of alcohol-associated positive and negative cardiovascular risk factors may be favorable or unfavorable.This analysis included 1255 adults from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) biomarker substudy. Participants, average age 54. (±11) years, were divided into 6 alcohol-use categories based on self-reported drinking habits. Current non-drinkers were classified as lifelong abstainers and former light drinkers, former moderate drinkers, or former heavy drinkers. Current alcohol users were classified as light, moderate, or heavy drinkers. A total AL score was calculated using 24 biomarkers grouped into 7 physiologic systems including cardiovascular, inflammation, glucose , , sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Mixed-effects regression models were fit to determine the relationship between alcohol use categories and AL with controls for covariates that may influence the relationship between alcohol use and AL.468 (37.6%) individuals were current non-drinkers while 776 (62.4%) were current drinkers. In adjusted mixed-effects regression models, all 3 groups of current drinkers had significantly lower average AL scores than the lifelong abstainer/former light drinker group (light: -0.23, 95% CI -0.40, -0.07, p < 0.01; moderate: -0.20, 95% CI -0.38, -0.02, p < 0.05; heavy: -0.30, 95% CI -0.57, -0.04, p < 0.05), while the average AL scores of former moderate and former heavy drinkers did not differ from the lifelong abstainer/former light drinker group.Current alcohol use is associated cross-sectionally with a favorable multisystem physiologic score known to be associated with better long-term health outcomes, providing evidence in support of long-term health benefits related to alcohol consumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614330>Impact of Polarized Versus Threshold Training on  and Neuromuscular Variables in Ultrarunners.</a></h2><p>To compare the effects of 2 different intensity distribution training programs (threshold [THR] and polarized [POL]) on  and neuromuscular variables.Twenty ultrarunners were allocated to POL (n = 11; age 40.6 [9.7] y, weight 73.

Both groups performed similar total training duration and load but with different intensity distribution during running sessions. Resting metabolic rate, , isometric rate of force development (RFD; N·s-1) and maximal voluntary contraction in the knee extensor, and electromyographic amplitude were measured before and after each program.A significant decrease in RFD0-100 ms (Δ -13.4%; P ≤ .001; effect size [ES] = 1.00), RFD0-200 ms (Δ -11.7%; P ≤ .001; ES = 1.4), and RFDpeak (Δ -18%; P ≤ .001; ES = 1.4) were observed in the POL group. In THR group, a significant increase in mean electromyographic amplitude (Δ 24.4%; P = .02; ES = 1.4) was observed. There were no significant differences between groups in any of the variables.Similar adaptations in  and neuromuscular performance can be achieved after 12 weeks of POL or THR intensity distribution. However, THR distribution appears to better maintain strength (RFD) and improve mean electromyographic amplitude. Nevertheless, the combination of both running and maximum strength training could influence on results because of the residual fatigue thus inducing suboptimal adaptations in the POL group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551808>Cardiotonic Pills Plus Recombinant Human Prourokinase Ameliorates Atherosclerotic Lesions in LDLR Mice.</a></h2><p>This study was to explore the protective effects of cardiotonic pills (CP) or/and recombinant human prourokinase (proUK)on the atherosclerosis and the potential underlying mechanism.Atherosclerosis was induced in LDLR/ mice by high  diet contained 20% lard and 0.% cholesterol.

We hypothesize that HDLs functional heterogeneity is comprised of metabolically distinct proteins, each on distinct HDL sizes and that are affected by diet. Approach and Results: Twelve participants were placed on 2 healthful diets high in monounsaturated  or carbohydrate. After 4 weeks on each diet, participants completed a metabolic tracer study. HDL was isolated by Apo (apolipoprotein) A1 immunopurification and separated into  sizes. Tracer enrichment and metabolic rates for 8 HDL proteins-ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC3, ApoE, ApoJ, ApoL1, ApoM, and LCAT (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase)-were determined by parallel reaction monitoring and compartmental modeling, respectively. Each protein had a unique, size-specific distribution that was not altered by diet. However, carbohydrate, when replacing , increased the fractional catabolic rate of ApoA1 and ApoA2 on alpha3 HDL; ApoE on alpha3 and alpha1 HDL; and ApoM on alpha2 HDL. Additionally, carbohydrate increased the production of ApoC3 on alpha3 HDL and ApoJ and ApoL1 on the largest alpha0 HDL. LCAT was the only protein studied that diet did not affect. Finally, global proteomics showed that diet did not alter the distribution of the HDL proteome across HDL sizes.This study demonstrates that HDL in humans is composed of a complex system of proteins, each with its own unique size distribution, , and diet regulation. The carbohydrate-induced hypercatabolic state of HDL proteins may represent mechanisms by which carbohydrate alters the cardioprotective properties of HDL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657437>How is the acyl chain composition of phosphoinositides created and does it matter?</a></h2><p>The phosphoinositide (PIPn) family of signalling phospholipids are central regulators in membrane cell biology. Their varied functions are based on the phosphorylation pattern of their inositol ring, which can be recognized by selective binding domains in their effector proteins and be modified by a series of specific PIPn kinases and phosphatases, which control their interconversion in a spatial and temporal manner. Yet, a unique feature of PIPns remains largely unexplored: their unusually uniform acyl chain composition. Indeed, while most phospholipids present a range of molecular species comprising acyl chains of diverse length and saturation, PIPns in several organisms and tissues show the predominance of a single hydrophobic backbone, which in mammals is composed of arachidonoyl and stearoyl chains. Despite evolution having favoured this specific PIPn configuration, little is known regarding the mechanisms and functions behind it. In this review, we explore the   that could control the acyl chain composition of PIPns as well as the potential roles of this selective enrichment. While our understanding of this phenomenon has been constrained largely by the technical limitations in the methods traditionally employed in the PIPn field, we believe that the latest developments in PIPn analysis should shed light onto this old question.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603067>Effects of dietary  level on growth, fatty acid profiles, antioxidant capacity and expression of genes involved in  in juvenile swimming crab, .</a></h2><p>The regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis mechanisms related to consumption of  has not been studied in swimming crab.

Three isonitrogenous diets were formulated to contain crude  levels at .8 %, 9.9 % and 15.1 %, respectively. Crabs fed the diet containing 15.1 %  had significantly lower weight gain, specific growth rate and survival, and higher feed conversion ratio than those fed the .8 % and 9.9 %  diets. Crabs fed .8 %  had lower malondialdehyde concentrations in the hemolymph and hepatopancreas than those fed the other diets. Highest glutathione peroxidase in hemolymph and superoxide dismutase in hepatopancreas were observed in crabs fed .8 % . The lowest fatty acid synthase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities in hepatopancreas were observed in crabs fed 15.1 % , whereas crabs fed .8 %  had lower carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 activity than those fed the other diets.

Because of the diversity of clinical symptoms and onset age, the diagnosis of this disease is difficult. Therefore, biomarker tests have attracted significant attention for earlier diagnostics. In this study, we developed a simultaneous analysis method for five urinary conjugated cholesterol metabolites, which are potential diagnostic biomarkers for a rapid, convenient, and noninvasive chemical diagnosis, using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). By the method, their urinary concentrations were quantified and the NPC diagnostic performances were evaluated. The developed LC/MS/MS method showed high accuracy and and satisfied all analytical method validation criteria. Analyzing the urine of healthy controls and patients with NPC, three of five urinary conjugated cholesterol metabolites concentrations corrected by urinary creatinine were significantly higher in the patients with NPC. As a result of receiver operating characteristics analysis, the urinary metabolites might have excellent diagnostic marker performance. 3β-sulfooxy-7β-hydroxy--cholenoic acid showed particularly excellent diagnostic performance with both 100% clinical sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that it is a useful NPC diagnostic marker. The urinary conjugated cholesterol metabolites exhibited high NPC diagnostic marker performance and could be used for NPC diagnosis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611846>Shared Autonomic Pathways Connect Bone Marrow and Peripheral Adipose Tissues Across the Central Neuraxis.</a></h2><p>Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is increased in both obesity and anorexia. This is unique relative to white adipose tissue (WAT), which is generally more attuned to metabolic demand. It suggests that there may be regulatory pathways that are common to both BMAT and WAT and also those that are specific to BMAT alone. The central nervous system (CNS) is a key mediator of adipose tissue function through sympathetic adrenergic neurons. Thus, we hypothesized that central autonomic pathways may be involved in BMAT regulation. To test this, we first quantified the innervation of BMAT by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive nerves within the metaphysis and diaphysis of the tibia of B6 and C3H mice. We found that many of the TH+ axons were concentrated around central blood vessels in the bone marrow. However, there were also areas of free nerve endings which terminated in regions of BMAT adipocytes. Overall, the proportion of nerve-associated BMAT adipocytes increased from proximal to distal along the length of the tibia (from ~3- to ~14-24%), regardless of mouse strain. To identify the central pathways involved in BMAT innervation and compare to peripheral WAT, we then performed retrograde viral tract tracing with an attenuated pseudorabies virus (PRV) to infect efferent nerves from the tibial metaphysis (inclusive of BMAT) and inguinal WAT (iWAT) of C3H mice. PRV positive neurons were identified consistently from both injection sites in the intermediolateral horn of the spinal cord, reticular formation, rostroventral medulla, solitary tract, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, subcoeruleus, Barrington's nucleus, and hypothalamus. We also observed dual-PRV infected neurons within the majority of these regions. Similar tracings were observed in pons, midbrain, and hypothalamic regions from B6 femur and tibia, demonstrating that these results persist across mouse strains and between skeletal sites. Altogether, this is the first quantitative report of BMAT autonomic innervation and reveals common central neuroanatomic pathways, including putative "command" neurons, involved in coordinating multiple aspects of sympathetic output and facilitation of parallel processing between bone marrow/BMAT and peripheral adipose tissue.Copyright © 2019 Wee, Lorenz, Bekirov, Jacquin and Scheller.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520202>Inhibition of intestinal lipases alleviates the adverse effects caused by high- diet in Nile tilapia.</a></h2><p>Intestinal lipases are -digesting enzymes, which play vital roles in  absorption in the intestine. To study the regulation of intestinal lipase activity in systemic  in fish, especially in the metabolic diseases caused by high- diet (HFD) feeding, we inhibited intestinal lipases in Nile tilapia to investigate the physiological consequences. In the present study, Nile tilapia were firstly fed with HFD (12% ) for 6 weeks to establish a fatty fish model. Afterwards, Orlistat as a potent intestinal lipase inhibitor was added into the HFD for the following -week feeding trial, with two dietary doses (Orlistat16 group, 16 mg/kg body weight; Orlistat32 group, 32 mg/kg body weight). After the trial, both doses of Orlistat treatment significantly reduced intestinal lipase activity,  absorption, hepatic  accumulation, and gene expression of lipogenesis, whereas increased gene expression of  catabolism. Moreover, intestinal lipase inhibition increased immune enzyme activities, antioxidant capacity, and gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, whereas lowered gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Besides, Orlistat could also improve the structure of the intestine and increase expression of intestinal tight-coupling protein. Taken together, intestinal lipase inhibition alleviated the adverse effects caused by HFD in Nile tilapia.

Thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic drugs, which activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) nuclear receptor, are potent stimuli for adipocyte browning yet fail to induce  expression in mouse adipocytes. In contrast,  is one of the most strongly TZD-induced transcripts in human adipocytes, although not in cells from all individuals. Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +2. kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human fat as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS. These  low-expression variants may account for human genetic associations in this region with obesity as well as neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632669>Histology and molecular biology studies on the expression and localization of angiopoietin-like protein 8 in human tissues.</a></h2><p>Angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL) 8 regulates the partitioning of triglycerides by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase in muscle and adipose tissues. ANGPTL8 is expressed in the liver and adipose tissue and secreted into the blood. However, the precise localization of ANGPTL8-expressing cells in these tissues remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the localization of ANGPTL8-expressing cells in human tissues. Using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tissue specimens, the expression of ANGPTL8 was investigated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and  hybridization (ISH). The expression level of ANGPTL8 mRNA was the highest in the liver, followed by lipoma, hibernoma and normal adipose tissue. In the liver, wild type (KF809856) and two splice variants of ANGPTL8 mRNA (KF809857 and KF809858) were found to be expressed. The expression level of the splice variant KF809858, which produces a short form of ANGPTL8, accounted for <1% of ANGPTL8 in the liver. IHC revealed that ANGPTL8 was expressed in hepatocytes in zone 1 of the hepatic acinus in the liver. In the adipose tissue, mature adipocytes weakly expressed ANGPTL8, while immature adipocytes strongly expressed it. ISH confirmed ANGPTL8 mRNA expression in portal hepatocytes and immature adipocytes. ANGPTL8 was expressed in the cells, which actively uptake and metabolize triglycerides. In hibernoma, the ANGPTL8 protein and mRNA were homogeneously expressed in tumor cells. The expression of ANGPTL8 was associated with the differentiation state and activity of  in a subpopulation of cells in the liver and adipose tissue.

This assay functions well with multiple adipose depots, a previously unattained analysis. To delipidate and facilitate recovery, tissues were homogenized in acetonitrile and the homogenate was frozen. The supernatant was evaporated, resuspended in an aqueous acetate buffer, and extracted with hexane to separate free (unconjugated) from sulfated steroids. Sulfated steroids in the aqueous medium were then hydrolyzed with sulfatase and extracted with hexane. Each extract was analyzed separately. HPLC resolution combined with the sensitivity and specificity of MS/MS allowed quantification of DHEA, E2, and T with 10, 10 and  fmol lower limits of quantification and linear ranges to 1 pmol. Application of the method to mouse serum and tissues reveals ranges of DHEA, E2, and T and their sulfates, and tissue-specific differences in steroid profile, especially white vs brown adipose. In addition, marginal decreases of T in all tissues and considerable increases in DHEA in male iWAT and eWAT in response to high- diet further strengthen the inference regarding role of steroid  in adipogenesis. This assay permits detailed studies of interactions between adiposity and sex steroids in serum and tissues, including adipose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614337>Metabolic impact of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma: Targeted metabolomics in patients before and after tumor removal.</a></h2><p>Excess catecholamine release by pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) leads to characteristic clinical features and increased morbidity and mortality. The influence of PPGLs on  is ill described but may impact diagnosis and management. The objective of this study was to systematically and quantitatively study PPGL induced metabolic changes at a systems level.Targeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of plasma specimens in a clinically well characterized prospective cohort study.Analyses of metabolic profiles of plasma specimens from 56 prospectively enrolled and clinically well characterized patients (23 males, 33 females) with catecholamine-producing PPGL before and after surgery, as well as measurement of 24h-urinary catecholamine using LC-MS/MS.From 127 analyzed metabolites, 15 were identified with significant changes before and after surgery:  amino acids/biogenic amines (creatinine, histidine, ornithine, sarcosine, tyrosine) and 1 glycerophospholipid (PCaeC34:2) with increased concentrations and 6 glycerophospholipids (PCaaC38:1, PCaaC42:0, PCaeC40:2, PCaeC42:, PCaeC44:, PCaeC44:6), 2 sphingomyelins (SMC24:1, SMC26:1) and hexose with decreased levels after surgery. Patients with a noradrenergic tumor phenotype had more pronounced alterations compared to those with an adrenergic tumor phenotype. Weak, but significant correlations for 8 of these 15 metabolites with total urine catecholamine levels were identified.This first large prospective metabolomics analysis of PPGL patients demonstrates broad metabolic consequences of catecholamine excess.

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) are the ideal source to study  formation as they are the progenitors of adipocytes. In this work, we used human MSCs, received from surgery waste, and differentiated them into  adipocytes. The combination of several layers of information coming from lipidomics, metabolomics and proteomics enabled network analysis of the biochemical pathways in adipogenesis. Simultaneous analysis of metabolites, lipids, and proteins in cell culture is challenging due to the compound's chemical difference, so most studies involve separate analysis with unimolecular strategies. In this study, we employed a multimolecular approach using a two-phase extraction to monitor the crosstalk between  and protein-based signaling in a single sample (~10 cells). We developed an innovative analytical workflow including standardization with in-house produced C isotopically labeled compounds, hyphenated high-end mass spectrometry (high-resolution Orbitrap MS), and chromatography (HILIC, RP) for simultaneous untargeted screening and targeted quantification. Metabolite and  concentrations ranged over three to four orders of magnitude and were detected down to the low fmol (absolute on column) level. Biological validation and data interpretation of the multiomics workflow was performed based on proteomics network reconstruction, metabolic modelling (MetaboAnalyst 4.0), and pathway analysis (OmicsNet). Comparing MSCs and adipocytes, we observed significant regulation of different metabolites and lipids such as triglycerides, gangliosides, and carnitine with 113 fully reprogrammed pathways. The observed changes are in accordance with literature findings dealing with adipogenic differentiation of MSC. These results are a proof of principle for the power of multimolecular extraction combined with orthogonal LC-MS assays and network construction. Considering the analytical and biological validation performed in this study, we conclude that the proposed multiomics workflow is ideally suited for comprehensive follow-up studies on adipogenesis and is fit for purpose for different applications with a high potential to understand the complex pathophysiology of diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557856>Increased Expression of  Genes in Early Stages of Wooden Breast Links Myopathy of Broilers to Metabolic Syndrome in Humans.</a></h2><p>Wooden breast is a muscle disorder affecting modern commercial broiler chickens that causes a palpably firm pectoralis major muscle and severe reduction in meat quality. Most studies have focused on advanced stages of wooden breast apparent at market age, resulting in limited insights into the etiology and early pathogenesis of the myopathy. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify early molecular signals in the wooden breast transcriptional cascade by performing gene expression analysis on the pectoralis major muscle of two-week-old birds that may later exhibit the wooden breast phenotype by market age at 7 weeks. Biopsy samples of the left pectoralis major muscle were collected from 101 birds at 14 days of age. Birds were subsequently raised to 7 weeks of age to allow sample selection based on the wooden breast phenotype at market age. RNA-sequencing was performed on  unaffected and 8 affected female chicken samples, selected based on wooden breast scores (0 to 4) assigned at necropsy where affected birds had scores of 2 or 3 (mildly or moderately affected) while unaffected birds had scores of 0 (no apparent gross lesions). Differential expression analysis identified 60 genes found to be significant at an FDR-adjusted -value of 0.05. Of these, 26 were previously demonstrated to exhibit altered expression or genetic polymorphisms related to glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus in mammals. Additionally, 9 genes have functions directly related to  and 11 genes are associated with adiposity traits such as intramuscular  and body mass index.

In this study, the effects of different processing techniques on the quality of rapeseed oil and animal  were evaluated. Results showed that rapeseed oil obtained by the aqueous enzymatic extraction (AEE) method had the highest polyphenol (152.08 ± 11.44 mg GAE per kg), α-tocopherol (208.97 ± 15.84 mg kg-1), and β-carotene (.40 mg kg-1) contents and a better oxidation resistance. It was noted in an experiment on rats fed with diets containing rapeseed oils that AEE rapeseed oil reduces total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), aspartate transaminase (ALT) and alanine transaminase (AST) in high- diet rats by 27.09%, 11.81%, 35.52%, 31.02% and 27.61%, respectively, and the body and liver weights of rats were decreased. mRNA expression indicated that AEE could significantly down-regulate fatty acid synthase (FAS) and up-regulate acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) gene expression levels (P < 0.05).

However, the effects of fucoidans on MetS were still not clear. In this study, we evaluated the activity of fucoidan from  (FvF) on attenuating MetS and first elucidated the underlying mechanism. In vitro, FvF treatment remarkably lowered the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with the sodium palmitate (PA)-induced insulin resistance (IR) group. The phosphorylation level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was significantly decreased, while phosphorylation of protein kinase B (pAkt) level increased, compared with that of the HepG2 cells treated with PA. Thus, FvF increased glucose consumption and relieved IR via ROS-mediated JNK and Akt signaling pathways. In addition, these changes were accompanied by the activation of adenosine '-monophosphate-ativated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream targets (e.g., HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1C)), which improved  in IR HepG2 cells. In vivo, FvF improved hyperglycemia and decreased serum insulin level in mice with MetS. Furthermore, we evaluated the inhibition of glucose transport by in vitro (Caco-2 monolayer model), semi-in vivo (everted gut sac model) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which indicated that FvF could significantly reduce the absorption of glucose into the blood stream, thus it could improve blood-glucose levels and IR in mice with MetS. Moreover, FvF decreased serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and liver  accumulation, while increased the serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level in mice with MetS. Therefore, FvF could be considered as a potential candidate for the treatment of MetS by alleviating IR, inhibiting glucose transportation, and regulating .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540318>The Anti-Obesity Effect of Polysaccharide-Rich Red Algae () Hot-Water Extracts in High- Diet-Induced Obese Hamsters.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the anti-obesity effect of a polysaccharide-rich red algae  hot-water extract (GHE) in high- (HF) diet-induced obese hamsters. GHE contained 68.54% water-soluble indigestible carbohydrate polymers. Hamsters were fed with a HF diet for  weeks to induce obesity, and then randomly divided into: HF group, HF with 3% guar gum diet group, HF with 3% GHE diet group, and HF with orlistat (200 mg/kg diet) group for 9 weeks. The increased weights of body, liver, and adipose in the HF group were significantly reversed by GHE supplementation. Lower plasma leptin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 levels were observed in the GHE+HF group compared to the HF group. GHE also increased the lipolysis rate and decreased the lipoprotein lipase activity in adipose tissues. GHE induced an increase in the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the protein expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 in the livers. The decreased triglyceride and total cholesterol in the plasma and liver were also observed in obese hamsters fed a diet with GHE.

To identify the insertion/deletion (InDel) variations of the  gene and evaluate their effects on -tail measurements and growth traits, 166 healthy individuals from Tong sheep were identified and analyzed. Herein, 10 novel InDel polymorphisms were founded in the Tong sheep  gene, which displayed intermediate polymorphism (0.25 < PIC < 0.) and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( > .05). Correlation analysis of 78 Tong sheep phenotypic traits data and InDel polymorphisms showed that eight InDel loci were significantly associated with partial growth traits ( < .05), four InDel loci were significantly correlated with -tail measurements ( < .05). In particular, individuals with genotype DD showed better phenotypic traits than individuals with other genotypes at male sheep InDel  and InDel 8 loci, which had small tail- dimensions while having good growth traits.

Besides, this CYP protein also involves in the  of -10% clinical medicines. Some peripheral mutations in CYP1A2 (P42R, I386F, R431W, and R456H) significantly decrease the enzyme activities, resulting in a vital reduction in substrate . To explore the effects of these peripheral mutations, we constructed a membrane-binding model for the full-length human CYP1A2 and studied their dynamic behaviors on lipid membranes. Free energy calculations indicate that the peripheral mutations do not influence substrate binding. P42R is located in the N-terminal anchor, and its positive charged sidechain is adverse to membrane binding. I386F enhances the van der Waals contacts of the water channel bottleneck and R456H breaks the hydrogen bonding interactions that function to position the BC loop, both of which result in a significant inhibition on the water channel. R431W causes a sidechain conformational rearrangement for aromatic residues around the substrate channel, making it in a closed state in most cases. Our computational simulations demonstrate that pi-pi stacking interactions are essential for substrate binding and channel opening. It is hoped that these findings may be of general relevance to the mutation-induced activity changes for CYP proteins, providing useful information for understanding the CYP-mediated drug .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636603>Luteal Lipids Regulate Progesterone Production and May Modulate Immune Cell Function During the Estrous Cycle and Pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Although the corpus luteum (CL) contains high concentrations of  in the form of steroid hormone precursors and prostaglandins, little is known about the abundance or function of other luteal  mediators. To address this, 79  mediators were measured in bovine CL, using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. CL from estrous cycle days 4, 11, and 18 were compared and, separately, CL from days 18 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy were compared. Twenty-three lipids increased as the estrous cycle progressed ( < 0.05), with nine increasing between days 4 and 11 and fourteen increasing between days 4 and 18. Overall, this indicated a general upregulation of  mediator synthesis as the estrous cycle progressed, including increases in oxylipins and endocannabinoids. Only 15-KETE was less abundant in the CL of early pregnancy ( < 0.05), with a tendency ( < 0.10) for four others to be less abundant. Notably, 15-KETE also increased between estrous cycle days 4 and 18. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen) indicated that functions associated with differentially abundant lipids during the estrous cycle included leukocyte activation, cell migration, and cell proliferation. To investigate changes in CL during maternal recognition of pregnancy, this  dataset was integrated with a published dataset from mRNA profiling during maternal recognition of pregnancy. This analysis indicated that lipids and mRNA that changed during maternal recognition of pregnancy may regulate some of the same functions, including immune cell chemotaxis and cell-cell communication. To assess effects of these  mediators, luteal cells were cultured with -KETE or 15-KETE. One ng/mL -KETE reduced luteal progesterone on day 1 of culture, only in the absence of luteinizing hormone (LH), while 1 ng/mL 15-KETE induced progesterone only in the presence of LH (10 ng/mL). On day 7 of culture, 0.1 ng/mL 15-KETE reduced prostaglandin (PG)F2A-induced inhibition of LH-stimulated progesterone production, while 1 ng/mL 15-KETE did not have this effect. Overall, these data suggest a role for  mediators during luteal development and early pregnancy, as regulators of steroidogenesis, immune cell activation and function, intracellular signaling, and cell survival and death.Copyright © 2019 Hughes, Bosviel, Newman and Pate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627083>Exogenous glycine betaine treatment alleviates low temperature-induced pericarp browning of 'Nanguo' pears by regulating antioxidant enzymes and proline .</a></h2><p>The effect of glycine betaine (GB) on chilling injury (CI)-induced pericarp browning in 'Nanguo' pears was investigated during shelf life at 20 °C after storage at 0 °C for 120 d.

A control group was fed a basal diet, while five experimental groups were supplemented with 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and .0g BLE per kg feed in their basal diets. The result indicated that BLE supplementation linearly improved eviscerated yield and decreased abdominal  ( < 0.05). A significant decrease of serum triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) content was observed with BLE supplementation ( < 0.05). BLE supplementation linearly improved the total antioxidant capacity and catalase activity in both serum and liver ( < 0.05). Glutathione peroxidase was quadratically increased in serum and linearly increased in the liver with BLE supplementation ( < 0.05). The malonaldehyde content in liver showed a linear and quadratic decrease with BLE supplementation ( < 0.05). BLE supplementation up-regulated the mRNA expression of cholesterol 7- alpha hydroxylase and low-density lipoprotein receptor and downregulated 3-hydroxy3-methyl glutamates coenzyme A reductase mRNA expression in the liver.

The Processed pattern was directly associated with LDL-c (T3: OR 6.08; 95%CI 1.80-20.58; P-trend = 0.004), while the Prudent pattern was inversely associated with LDL-c (T3: OR 0.26; 95%CI 0.08-0.87; P-trend = 0.029) and LDL-c/HDL-c ratio (T3: OR 0.28; 95%CI 0.08-0.97; P-trend = 0.046).Early feeding could be a protective factor against insulin resistance development, while current DP were associated with  profile. This evidence indicates that from early life until early adulthood, dietary habits might influence women's cardiometabolic risk profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528731>Influence of dietary hydrogenated palm oil supplementation on serum biochemistry and progesterone levels in dairy goats.</a></h2><p>The aim of this research was to investigate the influence of hydrogenated palm oil (HPO) added to a dairy goat diet on serum biochemistry and progesterone levels. Thirty pregnant Cilentana dairy goats were equally divided into 2 groups (control [CTR] and HPO groups). After kidding, concentrated feed for both groups was gradually increased up to 400 g/(animal·d), and the HPO group received 50 g/(animal·d) of HPO. Supplementation with HPO significantly increased cholesterol levels (mg/dL, 63.80 vs. 54.68 at 30 d,  ≤ 0.05; 78.20 vs. 58.00 at 60 d,  ≤ 0.05; 83.80 vs. 57.83 at 120 d,  ≤ 0.01) compared with the CTR group although no significant differences were detected for liver and kidney function indicators. Moreover, other biochemical parameters were not affected by HPO supplementation thus suggesting no change occurred in  and protein . Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between progesterone levels and serum cholesterol ( = 0.65,  ≤ 0.01) although these were not significantly higher in HPO supplemented goats. The dose and time of HPO supplementation appears critical as regards assessing the limits between the risks and benefits of HPO supplementation in dairy goats. At the tested dose, HPO was well tolerated by the animals and may represent a useful tool to increase energy availability during highly demanding periods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583405>Liver transcriptome profiling of beef steers with divergent growth rate, feed intake or metabolic body weight phenotypes.</a></h2><p>Average daily gain (ADG) and daily dry matter intake (DMI) are key determinants of beef industry profitability. These traits together with metabolic body weight (MWT) are combined as component traits to calculate residual feed intake (RFI), a common measure of feed efficiency in beef cattle. Recently, there have been significant efforts towards molecular genetic characterization of RFI through transcriptomic studies in different breeds and tissues. However, molecular mechanisms of RFI component traits still remain predominately unexplored. Therefore, in the current study we investigated the hepatic transcriptomic profiles and their associations with ADG, DMI and MWT in Angus, Charolais, and Kinsella Composite (KC) populations through global RNAseq analyses. In each population and for each trait, 12 steers with extreme phenotypes (n = 6 low and n = 6 high) were analyzed for differential gene expression. These animals were from 20 beef steers of each Angus, Charolais and KC breed population that were initially selected for a transcriptome study of residual feed intake (RFI). At a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and fold change ≥ 1., we identified 123, 102 and 78 differentially expressed (DE) genes between high and low-ADG animals of Angus, Charolais and KC populations, respectively. For DMI, 108, 180 and 156 DE genes were identified between high and low-DMI from Angus, Charolais and KC populations, respectively, while for MWT, 80, 82 and 84 genes were differentially expressed between high and low-MWT animals in Angus, Charolais and KC populations, respectively. The identified DE genes were largely breed-specific (81.7% for ADG, 82.7% for DMI, and 83% for MWT), but were largely involved in the same biological functions across the breeds. Among the most enriched biological functions included  of major nutrients (, carbohydrates, amino acids, vitamins and minerals), small molecule biochemistry, cellular movement, cell morphology and cell-to-cell signalling and interaction. Notably, we identified multiple DE genes that are involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, and immune response pathways for the three studied traits. Thus, our findings present potential molecular genetic mechanisms and candidate genes that influence feed intake, growth, and metabolic body weight of beef cattle.© Crown copyright 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552710>Endothelial function following interval exercise plus low-calorie diet treatment in obese females.</a></h2><p>We determined if interval exercise plus a low-calorie diet (LCD + INT) increases endothelial function more than an energy-matched LCD. Obese women (47.2 ± 2.6y, 37. ± 1.3kg/m ) were randomized to 13 days of a LCD (n = 12; mixed meals of ~ 1200kcal/d) or LCD + INT (n = 13; 12 supervised 60-min INT bouts of 3 min at 90% and 50% HR ). LCD + INT subjects received 350kcal postexercise to equate energy availability with LCD. Fitness (VO peak) and body composition (BodPod) were determined and a 120 min, 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was performed to examine fasting and postprandial flow-mediated dilation (FMD, endothelial function), respiratory exchange ratio (RER) via indirect calorimetry as well as glucose and insulin incremental area under the curve (iAUC ). LCD + INT increased VO peak (P = 0.02) compared with LCD, and both treatments decreased  mass (P < 0.001) and insulin iAUC (P = 0.03). There was no overall treatment effect on fasting or iAUC FMD. However, in participants who increased fasting endothelial function after each treatment (Δ > 50%; LCD n = , LCD + INT n = 7), LCD + INT increased fasted (P = 0.005) and decreased iAUC (P = 0.003) FMD compared with LCD. Enhanced fitness correlated with increased fasting FMD (r = 0.43, P = 0.03) and diminished FMD iAUC (r = -0.44, P = 0.03). Decreased FMD iAUC correlated with reduced glucose iAUC (r = 0.64, P = 0.001) as well as increased 60-min RER (r = -0.42, P = 0.04). Low baseline fasting and iAUC FMD was also linked to enhanced fasting and iAUC FMD post-treatment (r = -0.71, P < 0.001; r = -0.89, P < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, increasing fitness via INT may increase the effect of LCD on lowering cardiovascular disease risk in obese women.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the impact of hyperthermia on the hepatic metabolome has hitherto not been investigated.In this study, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics was applied to assess the in vitro metabolic response of primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH,  = 10) to a heat stress stimulus, i.e., after 24 h exposure to 40. °C. Metabolomic profiling of both intracellular metabolites and volatile metabolites in the extracellular medium of PMH was performed.Multivariate analysis showed alterations in levels of 22 intra- and 59 extracellular metabolites, unveiling the capability of the metabolic pattern to discriminate cells exposed to heat stress from cells incubated at normothermic conditions (37 °C). Hyperthermia caused a considerable loss of cell viability that was accompanied by significant alterations in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acids , urea cycle, glutamate , pentose phosphate pathway, and in the volatile signature associated with the  peroxidation process.These results provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying hyperthermia-induced hepatocellular damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626149>Impact of metabolic syndrome-related factors on the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms in Asian population.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the metabolic syndrome-related risk factors for the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in healthy men.A total of 4880 healthy men who underwent transrectal ultrasonography at our hospital during routine health examinations were included in this study. Those who had undergone a prior biopsy or surgery for prostate disease, were suspected of having urinary tract infection, or were taking BPH/LUTS or metabolic syndrome medications were excluded. BPH/LUTS was defined as an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of ≥8 and a prostate volume (PV) of ≥30 cm.The subjects had a mean age of 54.1 years, PV of 29.2 cm, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 1.20 ng/mL, and IPSS of 9.2. The annual PV growth rate was 0.48 cm/year. Age, body mass index (BMI), PSA, basal metabolic rate, apolipoprotein A-1, fasting blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were significant predictive factors for PV. Age, PSA, apolipoprotein B, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, HDL, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were predictors of BPH/LUTS at the initial health examination. A decreased  mass and LDL level were a significant risk factor for the development of BPH/LUTS within  years in men without a BPH/LUTS diagnosis at the initial examination.Metabolic syndrome-related variables were strongly associated with BPH/LUTS and by decreasing  mass and LDL levels, development of BPH/LUTS could be prevented within  years in healthy Korean men.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551806>Multi-Day Prolonged Low- to Moderate-Intensity Endurance Exercise Mimics Training Improvements in Metabolic and Oxidative Profiles Without Concurrent Chromosomal Changes in Healthy Adults.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress results in , protein, and DNA oxidation, resulting in telomere erosion, chromosomal damage, and accelerated cellular aging. Training promotes healthy metabolic and oxidative profiles whereas the effects of multi-day, prolonged, and continuous exercise are unknown. This study investigated the effects of multi-day prolonged exercise on metabolic and oxidative stress as well as telomere integrity in healthy adults.Fifteen participants performed a 14-day, 260-km, wilderness canoeing expedition (12 males) (EXP) (24 ± 7 years, 72 ± 6 kg, 178 ± 8.0 cm, 18.4 ± 8.4% BF, 47. ± 9.3 mlO kg min), requiring 6-9 h of low- to moderate-intensity exercise daily. Ten controls participated locally (seven males) (CON) (31 ± 11 years, 72 ± 15 kg, 174 ± 10 cm, 22.8 ± 10.0% BF, 47.1 ± 9.0 mlO kg min). Blood plasma, serum, and mononuclear cells were sampled before and after the expedition to assess hormonal, metabolic, and oxidative changes.Serum cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein, testosterone, insulin, sodium, potassium, urea, and chloride concentrations were not different between groups, whereas triglycerides, glucose, and creatinine levels were lower following the expedition ( < 0.001). Malondialdehyde and relative telomere length (TL) were unaffected (EXP: 4.2 ± 1.3 vs. CON: 4.1 ± 0.7 μM;  > 0.05; EXP: 1.00 ± 0.48 vs. CON: 0.89 ± 0.28 TS ratio;  = 0.77, respectively); however, superoxidase dismutase activity was greater in the expedition group (3.1 ± 0.4 vs. 0.8 ± 0. U ml;  < 0.001).These results indicate a modest improvement in metabolic and oxidative profiles with increased superoxidase dismutase levels, suggesting an antioxidative response to counteract the exercise-associated production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species during prolonged exercise, mimicking the effects from long-term training. Although improved antioxidant activity may lead to increased TL, the present exercise stimulus was insufficient to promote a positive cellular aging profile with concordant chromosomal changes in our healthy and young participants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580898>Diiodothyronines regulate metabolic homeostasis in primary human hepatocytes by modulating mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity.</a></h2><p>Until three decades, ago 3,-diiodothyronine (3,-T) and 3,3'-diiodothyronine (3,3'-T) were considered products of thyroid hormone catabolism without biological activity. Some metabolic effects have been described in rodents, but the physiological relevance in humans and the mechanisms of action are unknown. Aim of this work was to investigate the role and the mechanisms of action of 3,-T and 3,3'-T in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis in human liver. We used primary human hepatocytes freshly isolated from donors and grown on Matrigel as the golden standard in vitro model to study human hepatic . Results show that diiodothyronines in the range of plasma physiological concentrations reduced hepatic  accumulation, by modulating the activity of the mTORC1/Raptor complex through an AMPK-mediated mechanism, and stimulated the mTORC2/Rictor complex-activated pathway, leading to the down regulation of the expression of key gluconeogenic genes. Hence, we propose that diiodothyronines act as key regulators of hepatic metabolic homeostasis in humans.Copyright © 2019.

Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence of positive islet autoimmunity in T2DM community patients.495 community patients with T2DM were recruited totally using the method of Cluster sampling in this cross-sectional study. Three islet autoantibodies including GADA, IAA and ICA were measured, and clinical characteristics involved in those individuals were evaluated.The positive rate of islet autoantibodies was 28.% in total. Compared with GADA negative group, positive counterparts significantly tended to have lower levels of BMI, WHR, and mALB. Adjusted for confounding factors, WHR, Triglycerides (TG), mALB seemed to be negative independent predictors of GADA. Patients with positive IAA tended to receive insulin treatment (P<0.0001). Besides, FBG, HDL-CH, AST, and GGT were more likely to be higher in IAA positive subgroup in comparison with the negative counterparts. While after AST was adjusted by unconditional logistic regression analysis, history of insulin treatment, FBG, HDL-CH, and GGT were confirmed as positive predictors of IAA. Furthermore, in patients with IAA positive, those treated with exogenous insulin tended to have longer duration of diabetes than non-insulin treatment counterparts. With regard to ICA, however, there were no significant differences between the two subgroups, except that serum level of AST/ALT seemed to be slightly different (P=0.064).These data suggested thatT2DM community patients with positive GADA tended to be lean and were able to maintain normal , while patients with positivity of IAA were frequently accompanied with insulin treatment and more closely associated with diabetic liver damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668386>Fibroblast growth factor 21 is required for the therapeutic effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG against fructose-induced fatty liver in mice.</a></h2><p>High fructose feeding changes fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) regulation. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation reduces fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to determine the role of FGF21 and underlying mechanisms in the protective effects of LGG.FGF21 knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were fed 30% fructose for 12 weeks. LGG was administered to the mice in the last 4 weeks during fructose feeding. FGF21-adiponectin (ADPN)-mediated hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation were investigated.FGF21 expression was robustly increased after -weeks of feeding and significantly decreased after 12-weeks of feeding in fructose-induced NAFLD mice. LGG administration reversed the depressed FGF21 expression, increased adipose production of ADPN, and reduced hepatic  accumulation and inflammation in the WT mice but not in the KO mice. Hepatic nuclear carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) was increased by fructose and reduced by LGG, resulting in a reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes. The methylated form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) C, which dephosphorylates and activates ChREBP, was upregulated by fructose and normalized by LGG. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1, which methylates PP2AC, was also increased by fructose and decreased by LGG. However, those beneficial effects of LGG were blunted in the KO mice. Hepatic dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, which inhibits PP2A, was markedly increased by LGG in the WT mice but attenuated in the KO mice. LGG decreased adipose hypertrophy and increased serum levels of ADPN, which regulates sphingosine . This beneficial effect was decreased in the KO mice.LGG administration increases hepatic FGF21 expression and serum ADPN concentration, resulting in a reduced ChREBP activation through dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated PP2A deactivation, and subsequently reversed fructose-induced NAFLD. Thus, our data suggest that FGF21 is required for the beneficial effects of LGG in reversal of fructose-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Methyl ferulic acid (MFA) is a biologically active monomer isolated from the root of  Hasskarl. It has been reported that MFA has a hepatoprotective effect against alcohol-induced liver injury  and . However, the effect of MFA on ethanol-induced insulin resistance in ALD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether MFA could exert protective effects against hepatic insulin resistance in ethanol-induced L-02 cells and ALD rats. ALD was induced in vivo by feeding Lieber-DeCarli diet containing % (w/v) alcohol for 16 weeks to Sprague-Dawley rats. Insulin resistance was induced  in human hepatocyte L-02 cells with 200 mM ethanol for 24 h followed by 10-7 nM insulin for 30 min. MFA exhibited the effects of inhibited insulin resistance, reduced enzymatic capacity for hepatic gluconeogenesis, and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis both  and . In addition, the results of transcriptome sequencing of liver tissues in the ethanol- and MFA-treated groups indicated that "pyruvate ," "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis," and "fatty acid " were significantly different between ethanol- and MFA-treated groups. Further studies suggested that MFA activated the hepatic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway  and . Taken together, these findings suggested that MFA effectively ameliorated hepatic insulin resistance in ALD at least partially by acting on the PI3K/AKT pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632117>A Novel Indicator Of  Accumulation Product Associated With Metabolic Syndrome In Chinese Children And Adolescents.</a></h2><p>The  accumulation product (LAP) is a powerful marker for predicting metabolic syndrome (MS) in adults.

The presence of MS was defined according to the NCEP-ATP III criteria. The effects of BMI, WHtR and the CLAP for predicting MS were compared using logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.The prevalence of MS was .1% (6.6% and 3.% among boys and girls, respectively). Overall obesity (based on BMI), abdominal obesity (based on WHtR) and CLAP≥P75 were significantly associated with an increased risk of MS (ORs (95% CIs) were 143.79 (18.78-1101.22), 86.83 (27.19-277.27), 150.75 (20.11-1130.19), respectively). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the CLAP was higher than that for BMI and WHtR for predicting MS, with AUC (95% CI) values of 0.944 (0.913-0.975), 0.895 (0.864-0.927), and 0.928 (0.903-0.953), respectively.The children's  accumulation product (CLAP) was an effective indicator associated with MS in Chinese children and adolescents and was better than BMI and WHtR for predicting MS.© 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565961>Unravelling fatty liver haemorrhagic syndrome: 1.

In this study, a refined laying hen model was employed to permit further investigations. Intramuscular (i.m.) injections of exogenous oestrogen as β-estradiol-17-dipropionate (E) ( mg/kg BW) were given every 4 days for 20 days to 30-week-old hens fed either  or with restricted feed intake. Elevated (< 0.01) plasma oestrogen concentrations produced significant macroscopic and microscopic hepatic alterations. Hens in the E-treated  fed (EAL) group experienced a higher incidence of FLHS than hens in the E-treated restricted feed intake group, showing that birds with a higher feed intake are more at risk of developing FLHS. Histological examination of livers revealed that hens in the E-treated  fed group had consistent and severe  infiltration in the liver, and  vacuolization within hepatocytes.  accumulation and  droplets were found not only in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes but also in liver sinusoids. White blood cell counts and fibrinogen concentrations were altered (< 0.01) in hens treated with E when compared with controls. Plasma fibrinogen concentrations were altered over time, and correlated with white blood cell counts (Pearson's correlation  = 0.96; 0.001). Hens treated with E had increased (0.01) levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, confirming that E induced hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia.

Inactivating mutations on either the ABCG5 or ABCG8 subunit cause Sitosterolemia, a rare genetic disorder. In 2016, a crystal structure of human ABCG5/G8 in an apo state showed the first structural information on ATP-binding cassette (ABC) sterol transporters and revealed several structural features that were observed for the first time.

In the present study, we aimed to determine the multivariate triaxial PA intensity signature related to metabolic health in children, by investigating associations of the whole spectra of PA intensities from all axes using multivariate pattern analysis.We included 841 children (age, 10.2 ± 0.3 yr; body mass index, 18.0 ± 3.0; 50% boys) from the Active Smarter Kids study conducted in Norway 2014 to 2015 providing valid data on accelerometry (ActiGraph GT3X+) and several indices of metabolic health (aerobic fitness, abdominal fatness, insulin sensitivity, , blood pressure) that were used to create a composite metabolic health score. We created intensity spectra from 0 to 100 to ≥10,000 counts per minute for separate axes and used multivariate pattern analysis to analyze the data.The explained variance of metabolic health was 3.2% for counts per minute from the vertical axis, 17.0% for the vertical axis intensity spectrum, and 29.% for the full model including all axes. Thus, including full triaxial intensity spectra improved the model for metabolic health tenfold compared with using overall PA (counts per minute) from the vertical axis only. The intensity signature associated with metabolic health differed across the axes.Our findings show that the three different axes carry distinct information about children's PA and the relation of PA to their health and demonstrate a great potential for triaxial accelerometry and a multivariate analytic approach to advance the field of PA epidemiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610611>Tissue Distribution, Growth Dilution and Species-specific Bioaccumulation of Organic Ultraviolet Absorbents in Wildlife Freshwater Fish in the Pearl River Catchment, China.</a></h2><p>Tissue distributions, body-size dependent and species-specific bioaccumulation of 12 organic ultraviolet absorbents (UVAs) were investigated in 9 species of wildlife freshwater fish from the Pearl River (PR) catchment, South China. The concentration of 12 UVAs summed from 109 to 2320 ng/g  weight (lw) in the fish tissue samples. 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (BP-3), octocrylene (OCR), UV531, and  benzotriazole UV stabilizers (UVP, UV329, UV234, UV328, and UV327) were detected in more than half of the fish tissue samples. UV531 showed obvious potential of bioaccumulation in the wild freshwater fish with an estimated bioaccumulation factor (LogBAF) and a bio-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) of 4.54 ± 0.55 and 4.88 ± 6.78, respectively. Generally, liver (989±464 ng/g lw) contained the highest level of the UVAs, followed in decreasing order by belly  (599±318 ng/g lw), swimming bladder (494±282 ng/g lw), dorsal muscle (470±240 ng/g lw), and egg (442±238 ng/g lw). The UVAs bioaccumulation in the freshwater wild fish showed species-specific and compound - dependent. Bottom-dwelling detritus ingesting omnivorous fish contained obviously higher UVA concentrations, suggesting detritus/sediment ingestion a significant pathway for exposure of the wild freshwater fish to the UVAs.

Cachexia is a common problem in LAHNSCC. Yet changes in body composition and muscle weakness during CRT/BRT are underexplored. Strong evidence on the effect of TF on body composition during treatment is lacking. The aim of this cohort study was to assess (i) the relationship of -free mass index (FFMI) and handgrip strength (HGS) with CRT/BRT toxicity and outcome, (ii) body composition in patients treated with chemoradiation (cisplatin) vs. bioradiation (cetuximab), and (iii) the effect of the current TF regime on body composition and muscle strength.Locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with CRT/BRT between January 2013 and December 2016 were included (n = 137). Baseline measurements of body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis) and HGS were performed. Toxicity grades (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) were scored. In a subset of 69 patients, weight loss, body composition, and HGS were additionally assessed during and after CRT/BRT. TF was initiated according to the Dutch guidelines for malnutrition.In this cohort (68% male, mean age 59 ± 8 years), the incidence of baseline muscle wasting, defined as FFMI < P , was 29%. Muscle wasting was present in 23 of 100 (23%) chemoradiation patients and 17 of 37 (46%) bioradiation patients (P = 0.009). Muscle-wasted patients required more unplanned hospitalizations during CRT (P = 0.035). In the chemoradiation subset, dose-limiting toxicity was significantly higher in wasted vs. non-wasted patients (57% vs. 25%, P = 0.004). Median follow-up was 32 months. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified muscle wasting as independent unfavourable prognostic factor for overall survival [hazard ratio 2.1 (95% CI 1.1-4.1), P = 0.022] and cisplatin as favourable prognostic factor [hazard ratio 0.3 (95% CI 0.2-0.6), P = 0.001]. Weight and HGS significantly decreased during CRT/BRT, -3.7 ± 3. kg (P < 0.001) and -3.1 ± 6.0 kg (P < 0.001), respectively. Sixty-four per cent of the patients required TF 21 days (range 0-59) after CRT/BRT initiation. Total weight loss during CRT/BRT was significantly (P = 0.007) higher in the total oral diet group (. ± 3.7 kg) compared with the TF group (3.0 ± 3.2 kg). Loss of FFM and HGS was similar in both groups.In LAHNSCC patients undergoing CRT/BRT, FFMI < P is an unfavourable prognostic factor for overall survival, treatment toxicity, and tolerance. Patients experience significant weight and FFM loss during treatment. Current TF regime attenuates weight loss but does not overcome loss of muscle mass and function during therapy. Future interventions should consider nutritional intake and additional strategies specifically targeting , loss of muscle mass, and function.© 2019 The Authors.

Idebenone is a coenzyme Q10 synthetic quinone analog and an antioxidant that has been used in humans to treat diverse diseases where mitochondrial function is impaired. This study assessed if idebenone ameliorates murine lupus.Idebenone was administered orally to MRL/lpr mice at two different doses (either 1 or 1. g/kg diet) for 8 weeks. At peak disease activity, clinical, immunologic and metabolic parameters were analyzed and compared to untreated mice. Results were confirmed in the lupus-prone NZM2328 mouse model.In MRL/lpr mice, idebenone-treated mice showed significant attenuation in mortality (p<0.01) and in several features including glomerular inflammation and fibrosis (p<0.05) and renal function, in association with decreases in renal IL-17A and mature IL-18 expression. Levels of splenic proinflammatory cytokines and inflammasome-related genes were significantly decreased by idebenone, while no obvious toxicity was observed. Idebenone inhibited neutrophil extracellular trap formation in lupus mouse and human neutrophils. Idebenone also improved mitochondrial  (30% increase in basal respiration and ATP production), reduced heart  peroxidation in half , and significantly improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. NZM2328 mice exposed to idebenone also displayed improvements in renal and systemic inflammation.Idebenone ameliorates murine lupus disease activity and organ damage severity supporting the hypothesis that agents that modulate mitochondrial biology may have a therapeutic role in SLE.© 2019, American College of Rheumatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519474>Bone Health Following Bariatric Surgery: An Update.</a></h2><p>Obesity rates are increasing rapidly, and bariatric surgery is currently the most effective tool for weight loss. Recently, bariatric surgery induced bone loss has gained attention. Such detrimental effect on bone is multifactorial and causes may include nutrient deficiencies, gut and gonadal hormonal changes, mechanical unloading, loss of lean mass, increased bone marrow , and increased risk of fall. This review describes the available evidence on bone loss and fracture risk following bariatric surgery and summarizes the guidelines on the topic. Increased bone resorption starts early postsurgery, and bone markers peak at 1-2 yr. Across studies, the drop in areal bone mineral density is inconsistent at the lumbar spine, while a 2%-% drop at 6 mo and a 6%-10.% at 9-12 mo are observed at the total hip. Conversely, studies using quantitative CT showed a 6%-7% decrease in volumetric bone mineral density at the lumbar spine at 6-12 mo postsurgery. These studies also report significant bone loss at the radius and tibia, in addition to alteration in bone microarchitecture. Fracture risk increases 2 yr after surgery, more so following malabsorptive procedures. Fractures were reported at axial, weight bearing sites and at appendicular sites. The available evidence is very heterogeneous, and mostly derived from studies on Roux-en-y gastric bypass in premenopausal women. Data on restrictive procedures is scarce. Our findings suggest that the early postoperative phase represents the "golden window" to intervene and promote bone health. More research is needed to determine the effect of different bariatric procedures on bone, to identify optimal interventions to prevent bone loss and to characterize high risk individuals who should be targeted.Copyright © 2019 The International Society for Clinical Densitometry.

The patients were diagnosed between January 2009 and December 2018 at the Department of Ophthalmology and Pathology, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital. The main outcome measures included postoperative IgG4-ROD recurrence rate and differences between patients with and without recurrent disease.Fifteen patients (six male, 9 female; 61.8±16.2 years) were included. Twelve patients (80.0%) had dacryoadenitis disease and three patients (20.0%) had orbital  tissue disease. About 70%-100% of the lesion was resected in the debulking surgery and the pathological diagnosis was rendered. A definitive diagnosis was made in 13 cases (86.7%) and a probable diagnosis in 2 cases (13.3%). Patients were followed up for 39.0±25. months following operation. All patients had lesion volume reduction and patients with dacryoadenitis had eyelid swelling improvement after surgery. Two patients (13.3%) had disease recurrence and six patients (40.0%) had extraophthalmic lesions. There was no statistically significant difference in clinical features between relapsed and non-recurring cases.We observed a 13.3% relapse rate following debulking surgery in patients with IgG4-ROD who did not undergo further treatment. This rate is lower than the documented relapse rate of 30%-70% following oral prednisolone therapy. Therefore, debulking surgery may be a treatment option for IgG4-ROD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589891>Change in hepatic  content measured by MRI does not predict treatment-induced histological improvement of steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Proof-of-concept studies frequently assess changes in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content by magnetic resonance-based techniques as a surrogate marker of histology. The aim of this study was to establish how reliable this strategy is to predict changes in liver histology in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Patients with NASH who had participated in our prior randomized controlled trials of pioglitazone with complete paired data for IHTG content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liver histology were included in the study.A total of 121 patients were included. Changes in IHTG were assessed in several ways: as a continuous variable (correlations), as categorical groups (IHTG change ≥0%; or IHTG reduction of 1-30%; 31-50%; 51-70%; or >70%), and in a binomial way as steatosis resolution or not (defined as achieving IHTG <.56%). Changes in IHTG correlated with steatosis on histology (r = 0.54; p <0.01). However, the magnitude of IHTG reduction was not associated with the rate of response of the primary histological outcome (2-point improvement in the NAFLD activity score from 2 different parameters, without worsening of fibrosis) or resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis, neither in patients receiving pioglitazone nor placebo. Changes in lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, or liver fibrosis were also independent of changes in IHTG, irrespective of treatment arm. Steatosis resolution was not associated with better histological outcomes either.Changes in IHTG predict changes in steatosis but not of other liver histological parameters. This implies that IHTG response to treatment should be interpreted with caution, as it may not be as reliable as previously believed to predict a treatment's overall clinical efficacy in patients with NASH.Quantification of liver  by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used to assess treatment responses in patients with fatty liver, with the assumption that improvements in liver  translate into less inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis in the liver. However, in this article, we showed that changes in liver  do not necessarily translate into changes in these parameters. This means that MRI may not be as useful to assess treatment response in patients with fatty liver as previously believed.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4 n-6) is elevated in obesity and postulated to stimulate bone resorption. This study aimed to determine the effect of AA on bone mass, quality, and adiposity in diet-induced obesity during growth. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=42, 4-week) were randomized into groups fed a control diet (CTRL, AIN-93G), high- diet (HFD, 35% kcal ) or HFD + AA (1% w/w diet) for 6 weeks. Body composition, bone mineral density and microarchitecture were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and micro-computed tomography. Red blood cell fatty acid profile was measured with gas chromatography. Group differences were evaluated using repeated measures two-way analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Total energy intake did not differ among diet groups. At week 6, HFD + AA had significantly greater body  % (12%), body weight (6%) and serum leptin concentrations (125%) than CTRL, whereas visceral  (mass and %, assessed with micro-computed tomography) was increased in both HFD and HFD + AA groups. HFD + AA showed reduced whole body bone mineral content and femur mid-diaphyseal cortical bone cross-sectional area than HFD and CTRL, without impairment in bone strength. Contrarily, HFD + AA had greater femur metaphyseal trabecular vBMD (35%) and bone volume fraction (%) compared to controls. Inclusion of AA elevated leptin concentrations in male rats. The early manifestations of diet-induced obesity on bone mass were accelerated with AA. Studies of longer duration are needed to clarify the effect of AA on peak bone mass following growth cessation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Such experiments require many laboratory animals and are time-consuming and costly. An alternative test set-up for organic, neutral compounds using the amphipod Hyalella azteca was recently suggested, resulting in BCF values, which show a strong correlation with fish BCF data. In the present study, the bioconcentration potential of the ionic compound laurate was elucidated in H. Azteca. The sodium salt of 1- C laurate was applied to H. azteca in a flow-through and a semi-static approach. Due to rapid biodegradation, a semi-static approach with frequent media replacements was required to ensure stable media concentration. Laurate was also rapidly metabolised by H. azteca. A large proportion of the total radioactivity measured in the amphipod tissue was not extractable suggesting that mineralised laurate was accumulated in the calcified exoskeleton of H. azteca. This was confirmed in a further study using carbonate [ C]. A  normalised (.0 %) Hyalella BCF of 8.9 was calculated for laurate, measured as free fatty acids. The results of the bioconcentration studies with H. azteca confirm the low bioaccumulation potential of the test item previously observed in fish. However, more organic ionic compounds with various properties need to be tested to assess whether a general correlation between fish and Hyalella BCF data exists.

The correlation between the levels of miRNA expression and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the specificity and sensitivity of each individual miRNA. MiRNAs expression were further measured by PCR from exosomes, which were isolated from urine samples. LX2 cells were transfected with miRNA inhibitor and accumulation of cytoplasmic  droplets was analyzed by Oil Red O staining.miRNA expression profile analysis showed that 22 miRNAs were upregulated and 55 miRNAs were downregulated in CHB patients compared with Ctrl subjects (fold-change>1. and P < .05). miR-92b-3p, miR-770-5p, miR-5196-5p, and miR-7855-5p were significantly higher (P < .0001) in CHB subjects than in Ctrl subjects. ROC curve analysis showed that these four miRNAs were sensitive and specific enough to distinguish CHB and Ctrl subjects. The levels of miR-92b-3p expression were negatively correlated with total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and APOA-1. Moreover, in vitro experiments indicated that inhibition of miR-92b-3p increased  droplet formation in LX2 cells.Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been observed in urine of CHB patients.

A total of 20 six-week-old male rats were arranged randomly to two groups ( = 10/group), including a high- diet (HFD) group and a high- supplemented with arabinoxylan diet (AXD) group. Results showed that feeding AXD reduced serum lipopolysaccharide in rats after  weeks. In colonic digesta,  population was reduced, while ,  and  populations were increased in AXD group. Metabolomics assay found that the different abundances of 84 metabolites were observed, involving , carbohydrate, and nitrogenous  in colonic digesta. In colonic mucosa, AXD up-regulated gene level of tight-junction-related proteins. Meanwhile, lower TNF-α and IL-1β levels were related to TLR4/NF-κB/MyD88 pathway in AXD group. In conclusion, arabinoxylan could change colonic microbial  and improve the colonic mucosal barrier via modulating intestinal microflora and tight junction proteins.© 2019 The Authors.

To extend these findings, associations between perception of hunger and satiety with endocannabinoids, and with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and polypeptide YY (PYY) were assessed. At approximately 34 months after weight loss, 22 female and 16 male participants (mean age 64. ± .9 years; body mass index (BMI) 28.9 ± 3.9 kg/m) completed a 48 h respiration chamber study. Participants were fed in energy balance with a HP/MCHO diet with 25%:45%:30% or a moderate-protein/high-carbohydrate (MP/HCHO) diet with 15%:55%:30% of energy from protein:carbohydrate:. Endocannabinoids and related compounds, relevant postprandial hormones (GLP-1, PYY), hunger, satiety, and ad libitum food intake were assessed. HP/MCHO versus MP/HCHO reduced hunger perception. The lower decremental area under the curve (dAUC) for hunger in the HP/MCHO diet (-56.6% compared to MP,  < 0.05) was associated with the higher AUC for 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) concentrations ( < 0.05). Hunger was inversely associated with PYY in the HP/MCHO group (r = -0.7,  < 0.01). Ad libitum food intake, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and incremental AUCs for gut peptides were not different between conditions. HP/MCHO versus MP/HCHO diet-induced reduction in hunger was present after 34 months weight maintenance in the post-obese state. HP/MCHO diet-induced decrease of hunger is suggested to interact with increased 2-AG and PYY concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614841>Protein Isolate from  Seeds Improves Dyslipidaemia and Cardiac Oxidative Stress in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>Reports from previous studies now provide evidence that dyslipidaemia and oxidative stress play crucial roles in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetes and its related complications. This research is aimed to investigate the potential effects of protein isolate from  seeds (PBPI) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats by measuring blood glucose levels, changes in  and biomarkers of oxidative stress. Diabetic rats were treated orally with graded doses of PBPI, 200 mg/kg bw and 400 mg/kg bw, and  U/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.) of insulin once daily for 28 days with the fasting blood glucose (FBG) monitored weekly. The effect of PBPI on the serum  profile was measured while the extent of  peroxidation (LPO), as well as antioxidant parameters (superoxide dismutase; SOD, catalase; CAT, glutathione-S-transferase; GST and total glutathione; total GSH), was determined in the cardiac homogenates of diabetic rats. At the tested doses, treatment with PBPI was significantly effective in lowering FBG, serum triglyceride, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-c), while concurrently increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). PBPI also significantly decreased the elevations witnessed in LPO levels and restored the biomarkers of oxidative stress in the cardiac homogenate of experimental rats. The results from this study demonstrate that PBPI could improve dyslipidaemia and cardiac oxidative stress in the experimental diabetic animal model possibly by reducing and effectively scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as well as by increasing antioxidant capacity in combating oxidative stress. Therefore, it can be concluded that PBPI could be explored in the development of a potent cardioprotective supplement or adjuvant therapy towards the management of diabetes and its related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561490>Acute Impact of Dietary Pattern and Walking on Postprandial Attention, Mood, and Satiety in Older Adults: A Randomized Crossover Trial.</a></h2><p>Research suggests that attention, mood, and satiety can be influenced by meal composition and postprandial activity. The present study examined whether this hypothesis applies to persons with a risk phenotype for the development of cardiovascular/neurodegenerative diseases. A randomized crossover trial was conducted in subjects with metabolic syndrome traits ( = 26, 8 female, age 70 ± , BMI 30.3 ± 2.3 kg/m). Each subject participated in four interventions: iso-energetic (4300 kJ) meals (Western diet high-, WD, and Mediterranean-type diet, MD) followed by either 30 min of moderate walking (4.6 ± 0.1 km/h) or rest. Attention, mood, satiety and plasma cortisol concentrations were measured at fasting and 1., 3.0, 4. h postprandially. Data were analyzed by linear mixed models. In all interventions, attention increased continuously in the postprandial period (time effect,  < 0.001). After WD, attention was lower after walking compared to resting (meal × activity effect,  < 0.05). Postprandial mood was generally "good" with no intervention effects. Postprandial satiety increased reaching maximum at 1. h after meal (time effect,  < 0.001) and was higher after MD compared to WD (meal effect,  < 0.001). In all interventions, plasma cortisol decreased similar to its diurnal variation (time effect,  < 0.001). In our subjects, meal composition had no relevant impact on attention and mood. After typical WD, resting instead of walking seems to have a more beneficial effect on postprandial attention. MD leads to a strong and long-lasting feeling of satiety, possibly resulting in reduced energy intake in the further course of the day and, thus, long-term effect on weight control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547319>Relationships of Trait Anxiety and Loss of Control Eating with Serum Leptin Concentrations among Youth.</a></h2><p>Loss of control (LOC) eating in youth is associated with elevated fasting serum leptin, even after accounting for adiposity. Anxiety is closely linked to, and may exacerbate, LOC eating. Yet, it remains unclear how anxiety relates to leptin, or if the relationship is moderated by the presence of LOC eating. We examined whether self-reported trait anxiety interacted with LOC eating in relation to leptin in a convenience sample of youths ( = 592; 13.1 ± 2.7 years; body mass index -score (BMI) = 0.9 ± 1.1; 61.8% girls; 53.% non-Hispanic White; 36.6% with LOC eating). LOC eating was assessed by interview. Leptin was measured after an overnight fast. Exploratory analyses were conducted to examine anxiety and LOC eating in relation to laboratory intake patterns in three sub-samples. In a generalized linear model adjusting for relevant covariates, anxiety significantly interacted with LOC eating in relation to leptin ( = 0.02), such that greater trait anxiety related to higher concentrations of leptin only among youth with LOC eating. Trait anxiety was not significantly related to fasting serum leptin independently in a generalized linear model adjusting for age, race, height, sex, study type, and  mass (kg). Exploratory mechanistic analyses of food intake patterns did not identify consistent results for participants with both anxiety and LOC eating. Among youth with LOC eating, anxiety may be associated with higher serum leptin. Prospective data are required to elucidate the directionality and mechanisms of these relationships.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546588>Unique Features of  Sulfur ; Compartmentalization, Physiological Roles of Terminal Products, Evolution and Pharmaceutical Exploitation.</a></h2><p>Sulfur  is essential for all living organisms.

Two major interventions purported to offset sarcopenia are anabolic steroid therapies and resistance exercise training (RET). Nonetheless, the efficacy and physiological and molecular impacts of T therapy adjuvant to short-term RET remain poorly defined.Eighteen non-hypogonadal healthy older men, 65-75 years, were assigned in a random double-blinded fashion to receive, biweekly, either placebo (P, saline, n = 9) or T (Sustanon 250 mg, n = 9) injections over 6 week whole-body RET (three sets of 8-10 repetitions at 80% one-repetition maximum). Subjects underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, ultrasound of vastus lateralis (VL) muscle architecture, and knee extensor isometric muscle force tests; VL muscle biopsies were taken to quantify myogenic/anabolic gene expression, anabolic signalling, muscle protein synthesis (D O), and breakdown (extrapolated).Testosterone adjuvant to RET augmented total -free mass (P=0.007), legs -free mass (P=0.02), and appendicular -free mass (P=0.001) gains while decreasing total  mass (P=0.02). Augmentations in VL muscle thickness, fascicle length, and quadriceps cross-section area with RET occured to a greater extent in T (P < 0.05). Sum strength (P=0.0009) and maximal voluntary contract (e.g. knee extension at 70°) (P=0.002) increased significantly more in the T group. Mechanistically, both muscle protein synthesis rates (T: 2.13 ± 0.21%·day vs. P: 1.34 ± 0.13%·day , P=0.0009) and absolute breakdown rates (T: 140.2 ± 15.8 g·day vs. P: 90.2 ± 11.7 g·day , P=0.02) were elevated with T therapy, which led to higher net turnover and protein accretion in the T group (T: 8.3 ± 1.4 g·day vs. P: 1.9 ± 1.2 g·day , P=0.004). Increases in ribosomal biogenesis (RNA:DNA ratio); mRNA expression relating to T  (androgen receptor: 1.4-fold; Srd5a1: 1.6-fold; AKR1C3: 2.1-fold; and HSD17β3: two-fold); insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signalling [IGF-1Ea (3.-fold) and IGF-1Ec (three-fold)] and myogenic regulatory factors; and the activity of anabolic signalling (e.g. mTOR, AKT, and RPS6; P < 0.05) were all up-regulated with T therapy. Only T up-regulated mitochondrial citrate synthase activity (P=0.03) and transcription factor A (1.41 ± 0.2-fold, P=0.0002), in addition to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1-α mRNA (1.19 ± 0.21-fold, P=0.037).Administration of T adjuvant to RET enhanced skeletal muscle mass and performance, while up-regulating myogenic gene programming, myocellular translational efficiency and capacity, collectively resulting in higher protein turnover, and net protein accretion. T coupled with RET is an effective short-term intervention to improve muscle mass/function in older non-hypogonadal men.© 2019 The Authors.

Melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), contributes to appetite control in hypothalamic neurons and is a target for future anti-obesity treatments (such as setmelanotide) or novel drug development effort. Proper MC4R trafficking regulation in hypothalamic neurons is crucial for normal neural control of homeostasis and is altered in obesity and in presence of lipids. The mechanisms underlying altered MC4R trafficking in the context of obesity is still unclear. Here, we discovered that C2CD5 expressed in the hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of MC4R endocytosis. This study unmasked a novel trafficking protein nutritionally regulated in the hypothalamus providing a novel target for MC4R dependent pathways involved in bodyweight homeostasis and Obesity.To evaluate the expression of C2cd5, we first used in situ hybridization and RNAscope technology in combination with electronic microscopy. For in vivo, we characterized the energy balance of wild type (WT) and C2CD5 whole-body knockout (C2CD5KO) mice fed normal chow (NC) and/or western-diet (high-/high-sucrose/cholesterol) (WD). To this end, we performed comprehensive longitudinal assessment of bodyweight, energy balance (food intake, energy expenditure, locomotor activity using TSE metabolic cages), and glucose homeostasis. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of loss of C2CD5 on feeding behavior changes normally induced by MC4R agonist (Melanotan, MTII) injection in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). For in vitro approach, we tease out the role of C2CD5 and its calcium sensing domain C2 in MC4R trafficking. We focused on endocytosis of MC4R using an antibody feeding experiment (in a neuronal cell line - Neuro2A (N2A) stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP; against HA-tag and analyzed by flux cytometry).We found that 1) the expression of hypothalamic C2CD5 is decreased in diet-induced obesity models compared to controls, 2) mice lacking C2CD5 exhibit an increase in food intake compared to WT mice, 3) C2CD5 interacts with endocytosis machinery in hypothalamus, 4) loss of functional C2CD5 (lacking C2 domain) blunts MC4R endocytosis in vitro and increases MC4R at the surface that fails to respond to MC4R ligand, and, ) C2CD5KO mice exhibit decreased acute responses to MTII injection into the PVH.Based on these, we conclude that hypothalamic C2CD5 is involved in MC4R endocytosis and regulate bodyweight homeostasis. These studies suggest that C2CD5 represents a new protein regulated by metabolic cues and involved in metabolic receptor endocytosis. C2CD5 represent a new target and pathway that could be targeted in Obesity.Copyright © 2019.

At present, the early diagnosis and postoperative recurrence monitoring are still more difficult due to the lack of effective biomarkers in GCT. As an effective tool, metabolomics has played an essential role in the biomarkers research of many tumors. However, there has been no related study of the metabolomics of GCT up to now. The purpose of this study was to identify several key metabolites as potential biomarkers for GCT by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolic profiles.Patients with GCT in our hospital were recruited in this study and their plasma was collected as the research sample, and plasma collected from healthy subjects was considered as the control. NMR was then utilized to detect all samples. Furthermore, based on correlation coefficients, variable importance for the projection values and P values of metabolites obtained from multidimensional statistical analysis, the most critical metabolites were selected as potential biomarkers of GCT. Finally, relevant metabolic pathways involved in these potential biomarkers were determined by database retrieval, based on which the metabolic pathways were plotted.Finally, 28 GCT patients and 26 healthy volunteers agreed to participate in the study. In the multidimensional statistical analysis, all results showed that there was obvious difference between the GCT group and the control group. Ultimately, 18 metabolites with significant differences met the selection condition, which were identified as potential biomarkers. Through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Human Metabolome Database (HMD) database searching and literature review, these metabolites were found to be mainly correlated with glucose , , amino acid , and intestinal microbial . These metabolic disorders might, in turn, reflect important pathological processes such as proliferation and migration of tumor cells and immune escape in GCT.Our work showed that these potential biomarkers identified appeared to have early diagnostic and relapse monitoring values for GCT, which deserve to be further investigated. In addition, it also suggested that metabolomics profiling approach is a promising screening tool for the diagnosis and relapse monitoring of GCT patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530423>Lipoprotein(a) as a key target in combined therapeutic approaches for cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent cardiovascular risk factor but is closely associated with other similar risk factors that are manageable with appropriate treatment and guidance. We aimed to study the impact of using combined therapy for managing Lp(a) levels in patients at high cardiovascular risk but without major adverse cardiovascular events, in primary prevention.We conducted a retrospective observational study in 516 patients randomly selected from a group of 1677 patients who attended cardiovascular risk and  consultations between 1995 and 2015.

Cardiovascular risk was calculated based on the Framingham risk score, the European Society of Cardiology's SCORE and the American College of Cardiology's ASCVD Risk Estimator, and changes in patients' lifestyle were assessed.Significant differences (p<0.001) were found in almost all metabolic variables, except fasting insulin and C-peptide. Lp(a) levels were also significantly reduced (p<0.001). Carotid intima-media thickness improved, decreasing from 2.90 mm to 1.40 mm; however, there was no reduction in the number of cases of vascular stenosis. Of patients with hepatic steatosis (85.%), 40.7% presented hepatomegaly, but liver function was only altered in a few patients (14.%). -lowering therapy, especially statins, significantly decreased Lp(a), benefiting from synergy with other treatments.Lp(a) is a key overall indicator of vascular risk and should be considered a therapeutic target. Besides a healthy lifestyle, primary prevention should include combined drug therapies to address all cardiovascular risk factors and to delay the atherosclerotic process.Copyright © 2019 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

In the present study, the effects of DADS on  and its potential role in the modulation of the gut microbiome were determined. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil‑red O staining were used to assess the liver and intestinal tissues of mice treated with DADS. The expression of ‑associated genes was measured using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR). The effects of DADS on the gut microbiome were measured using 16S recombinant (r)DNA gene analysis. The results revealed that the serum non‑esterified free fatty acids, high density lipoprotein‑cholesterol, low density lipoprotein‑cholesterol, serum total cholesterol, liver triglyceride and total cholesterol levels of the mice fed with a low‑dose of DADS was significantly higher when compared with the control. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil‑red O staining demonstrated that DADS induced fatty liver in mice. The results of the RT‑qPCR revealed that the expression levels of a number of ‑associated genes were altered in the livers of mice treated with DADS. The 16S rDNA gene analysis demonstrated that the mice fed on a normal diet treated with a low‑dose of DADS had decreased levels of bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phyla and increased levels of bacteria from the Firmicutes phyla. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed the top 20 pathways enriched in the low‑dose DADS group of mice fed with a normal diet. In the present study, low‑dose DADS induced fatty liver and altered the gut microbiota, similar to the phenotype induced by a high  diet, by regulating the expression of  associated genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541782>Influence of cAMP modulator supplementation of in vitro culture medium on Bos taurus indicus embryos.</a></h2><p>The effectiveness of the use of natriuretic peptide C (NPPC) in the blocking of meiosis has already been proven in several species. However, there are no reports on the use of NPPC in the activation of metabolic processes in embryos. Whereas modulations of cAMP concentrations alter the  of bovine oocytes, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of NPPC on the development,  content and transcript levels of genes related to  of IVP bovine embryos. For this purpose, ovaries were obtained from a slaughterhouse, and oocytes were fertilized in vitro (D0). From D5 of in vitro culture, embryos were treated with 100 nM NPPC (NPPC group) or with no NPPC (Control group) and evaluated in terms of Blastocyst (D7) and hatching rates (D10). For the assessment of the cytoplasmatic  amounts, blastocysts were stained with Sudan Black B dye. The embryonic  profile was investigated by electrospray ionization desorption-mass spectrometry (DESI-MS). The abundance of nine transcripts related to  were assessed using the Biomark HD system. For statistical analysis, blastocyst and hatching rates,  content by the Sudan Black B and variation of gene expression between groups were compared by Student t-test. For  profile analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and fold-change were performed. The embryo  content was similar between NPPC (881 ± 3.7) and Control (883 ± .2) groups (p > 0.05). However, cholesteryl esters and TAGs were downregulated by NPPC at multiple levels according to the DESI-MS profiles. Of the analyzed genes, ELOVL6 and SREBF1 showed an up-regulation in the control group (p < 0.05), while CPT2 was observed to be up-regulated in the NPPC-treated embryos. There was no significant difference in the blastocyst production rate between NPPC (44.4%) and Control (42.4%), however the hatching rate at D10 was higher (p < 0.05) in the NPPC group (69.77%) when compared to the Control group (48.33%). These findings demonstrate that NPPC alters the mRNA expression of genes related to  and that it exerts a positive effect on the hatching rates of IVP Bos taurus indicus embryos.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genotyped for the SNPs APOE rs429358 and rs7412; CTEP rs3764261; LIPC rs10468017 and rs493258; LPL rs12678919; ABCA1 rs1883025; ABCA4 rs76157638, rs3112831 and rs1800555; and SCARB1 rs5888, using TaqMan probes. An additional association study of ε2, ε3 and ε4 major isoforms of APOE gene with AMD has been carried out.The allele and genotype frequencies for each of the eleven sequence variants in the lipid  genes did not show significant differences when comparing AMD cases and controls. Statistical analysis revealed that APOE-ε2 carrier genotypes were less frequently observed in patients with wet AMD compared to controls (.8% versus 13.7%, respectively: p = 3.28 × 10 ; OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.19-0.95).

The randomized, double-blind, controlled intervention study aimed to evaluate the effects of an energy-reduced diet containing isomaltulose (ISO, Palatinose™) versus sucrose (SUC) on body weight loss. Sixty-four healthy overweight/obese adults were allocated to consume either 40g/d ISO or SUC added to an energy-reduced diet for 12 weeks. Anthropometric measurements, body composition, and energy  were assessed at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Fifty participants (age: 40.7 ± 11.7 y; BMI: 29.4 ± 2.7 kg/m²) completed the study. During the 12 weeks, both groups significantly lost weight ( < 0.001), which was more pronounced following ISO (-3.2 ± 2.9 vs. -2.1 ± 2.6 kg;  = 0.258). Moreover, for participants in the ISO group, this was accompanied by a significant reduction in  mass (ISO: -1.9 ± 2.,  = 0.005; SUC: -0.9 ± 2.6%,  = 0.224). The overall decrease in energy intake was significantly higher in the ISO compared to that in the SUC group ( = 0.022). In addition, breakfast containing ISO induced a significantly lower increase in postprandial respiratory quotient (RQ) (mean incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for ISO vs. SUC: 4.8 ± 4.1 vs. 6.9 ± 3.1,  = 0.047). The results suggest that ISO in exchange for SUC may help to facilitate body weight reduction, lower postprandial RQ associated with higher  oxidation, and reduce energy intake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599289>Altered triglyceride and phospholipid  predates the diagnosis of gestational diabetes in obese pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes (GDM), a common pregnancy complication associated with obesity and long-term health risks, is usually diagnosed at approximately 28 weeks of gestation. An understanding of  in women at risk of GDM could contribute to earlier diagnosis and treatment. We tested the hypothesis that altered  at the beginning of the second trimester in obese pregnant women is associated with a diagnosis of GDM. Plasma samples from 831 participants (16-45 years, 15-18 weeks gestation, BMI ≥ 30) from the UPBEAT study of obese pregnant women were used. The , sterol and glyceride fraction was isolated and analysed in a semi-quantitative fashion using direct infusion mass spectrometry. A combination of uni-, multi-variate and multi-variable statistical analyses was used to identify candidate biomarkers in plasma associated with a diagnosis of GDM (early third trimester; IADPSG criteria). Multivariable adjusted analyses showed that participants who later developed GDM had a greater abundance of several triglycerides (48:0, 50:1, 50:2, 51:, 53:4) and phosphatidylcholine (38:). In contrast sphingomyelins (32:1, 41:2, 42:3), lyso-phosphatidylcholine (16:0, 18:1), phosphatidylcholines (35:2, 40:7, 40:10), two polyunsaturated triglycerides (46:, 48:6) and several oxidised triglycerides (48:6, 54:4, 56:4, 58:6) were less abundant.

This trial aimed to determine the effect of dietary fibre (DB) (mix of wheat, soy and sugar beet pulp fibres) and aleurone supplementation and their interaction on energy and nitrogen balances in growing pigs with ad libitum access to feed. Forty pigs (BW: 35 kg) were fed diets differing by fibre concentration (NDF concentration: 10% or 14% DM) and aleurone supplementation (0, 2 or 4 g/kg) during 3 weeks. Pigs were housed individually in a respiration chamber during the last week to record feeding behaviour and measure energy and nitrogen balances (n = 36). Glucose oxidation was studied on the 6th day with an injection of [U-13C] glucose and measurement of 13CO2 production. There was no significant interaction between DB inclusion and aleurone supplementation on any variables characterizing feeding behaviour. Pigs had less but longer meals with high level of DB, with an increased interval between two meals without effect on daily feed intake. The meal frequency significantly decreased when aleurone supplementation increased. Total tract apparent digestibility coefficient of DM, organic matter, ash, nitrogen and gross energy decreased when pigs received high DB level. Dietary fibre level increased significantly faecal excreted nitrogen. Aleurone supplementation decreased nitrogen retention. Free access to the feed induced a great individual variability not only in feed intake level (from 784 to 2290 g/day) but also in feeding behaviour (from . to 21. meals per day). This variability can be linked with the importance of underlying feed intake regulation pathways and difference in energy balance and  efficiency. Several profiles of  efficiency can be discriminate, thanks to a clustering based on feeding behaviour and pre-prandial concentrations of metabolites and hormones. In conclusion, DB inclusion decreased meal frequency, increased average meal size, decreased total tract apparent faecal digestibility coefficient of nitrogen and gross energy. Supplementation of aleurone decreased average daily feed intake with a reduction of the meal number per day, without modification of average meal size. Aleurone supplementation decreased nitrogen retention and nutrient deposition. Independently of experimental diets, the high individual variability permitted discriminating different profiles with different metabolic strategies. Efficient pigs with a high energy retention as protein and  seem to be able to adapt their  according to energy sources.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638831>Inhibition of dengue virus infection by 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylinositol .</a></h2><p>Dengue fever is an acute febrile infectious disease caused by dengue virus (DENV). Despite the significant public health concerns posed by DENV, there are currently no effective anti-DENV therapeutic agents. To develop such drugs, a better understanding of the detailed mechanisms of DENV infection is needed. Both  and  synthesis are activated in DENV-infected cells, so we used  screening to identify potential antiviral  molecules. We identified 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylinositol (SAPI), which is the most abundant endogenous phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecular species, as an anti-DENV  molecule. SAPI suppressed the cytopathic effects induced by DENV2 infection as well as the replication of all DENV serotypes without inhibiting the entry of DENV2 into host cells. However, no other PI molecular species or PI metabolites, including lysophosphatidylinositols and phosphoinositides, displayed anti-DENV2 activity. Furthermore, SAPI suppressed the production of DENV2 infection-induced cytokines and chemokines, including C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL), CCL20, C-X-C chemokine ligand 8, IL-6, and IFN-β. SAPI also suppressed the TNF-α production induced by LPS stimulation in macrophage cells differentiated from THP-1 cells.

We optimized codons of all the genes involved in isoprene synthesis by the mevalonate pathway and manipulated the promoter regions using pLac and pJ5 elements. Our results showed that isoprene productivity was higher using the J5 promoter (1.9 ± 0.24 µg/l) than when using the lac promoter (1. ± 0.2 µg/l). Additionally, the use of three J5 promoters was more efficient (3.8 ± 0.18 µg/l) for isoprene production than a one-promoter system, and could be scaled up to a -L batch-cultivation from a T-flask culture.

The insufficient level of carbohydrates forces the body to primarily use  instead of sugar as a fuel source. Due to its characteristic, KD has often been used to treat metabolic disorders, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Skeletal muscle constitutes 40% of total body mass and is one of the major sites of glucose disposal. KD is a well-defined approach to induce weight loss, with its role in muscle adaptation and muscle hypertrophy less understood. Considering this lack of knowledge, the aim of this review was to examine the scientific evidence about the effects of KD on muscle hypertrophy. We first described the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy per se, and secondly, we discussed the characteristics and the metabolic function of KD. Ultimately, we provided the potential mechanism that could explain the influence of KD on skeletal muscle hypertrophy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525129>Effects of Consuming Almonds on Insulin Sensitivity and Other Cardiometabolic Health Markers in Adults With Prediabetes.</a></h2><p> This study was designed to assess the effects of replacing high-carbohydrate (CHO) foods with raw almonds on insulin sensitivity and cardiometabolic health markers in overweight or obese adults with prediabetes.  This randomized crossover study consisted of two 6-week dietary intervention periods, separated by a ≥ 4-week washout. Subjects incorporated 1. oz of raw almonds twice daily or isocaloric CHO-based foods into their diets, with instructions to maintain body weight. Dietary intakes as well as insulin sensitivity, CHO  indices, lipoprotein lipids and particles, and inflammatory markers were assessed.  Thirty-three subjects (17 male, 16 female), mean age 48.3 ± 2.2 years and body mass index 30. ± 0.7 kg/m, provided evaluable data. Compared to CHO, almonds resulted in significantly ( < 0.01) higher intakes of protein,  (unsaturated fatty acids), fiber, and magnesium and significantly ( < 0.001) lower intakes of CHO and sugars. No differences were observed between diet conditions for changes from baseline in the insulin sensitivity index from a short intravenous glucose tolerance test or other indices of glucose homeostasis. No significant differences were observed in biomarkers of cardiovascular risk except that the CHO intervention led to a shift toward a higher concentration of cholesterol in small, dense low-density lipoprotein subfraction 3+4 (LDL3 + 4) particles ( = 0.024 vs almonds).

The demographic data, anthropometric parameters, and laboratory results were collected from 24 512 type 2 diabetes patients. The BP goal was a systolic BP <130 mm Hg and a diastolic BP <80 mm Hg regardless of a history of hypertension or current antihypertensive treatment. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 59.9% with geographical differences. Among the diabetes patients with hypertension, 76.9% received antihypertensive medicines. Calcium channel blockers (39.3%), angiotensin II receptor antagonists (26.6%), and then β-blockers (14.0%) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (13.6%) were frequently used for BP control. Only 17.% (n = 2658) of diabetes patients with hypertension reached the recommended target BP. Body mass index <24 kg/m , urban resident, frequent physical activity, good adherence to medication, comorbidity with cardiovascular disease, achieving glycemic goal (HbA1c <7.0%), achieving  goal (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <2.59 mmol/L) were independent factors that predicted achievement of target BP goal. On the contrary, comorbidity with chronic kidney disease predicted failure to achieve target BP goal. Patients who were treated in a cardiology department or lived in the North were more likely to achieve BP goals. A considerable proportion of diabetic patients failed to achieve guideline-recommended BP targets. More aggressive efforts should be made to overcome the diverse barriers and facilitate the optimization of diabetes management.©2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540955>The Parkinson's disease gene  activates Akt via PINK1 kinase-dependent regulation of the phospholipid PI(3,4,)P.</a></h2><p>Akt signalling is central to cell survival, , protein and  homeostasis, and is impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD). Akt activation is reduced in the brain in PD, and by many PD-causing genes, including  This study investigated the mechanisms by which PINK1 regulates Akt signalling. Our results reveal for the first time that PINK1 constitutively activates Akt in a PINK1-kinase dependent manner in the absence of growth factors, and enhances Akt activation in normal growth medium. In PINK1-modified MEFs, agonist-induced Akt signalling failed in the absence of PINK1, due to PINK1 kinase-dependent increases in PI(3,4,)P at both plasma membrane and Golgi being significantly impaired. In the absence of PINK1, PI(3,4,)P levels did not increase in the Golgi, and there was significant Golgi fragmentation, a recognised characteristic of PD neuropathology. PINK1 kinase activity protected the Golgi from fragmentation in an Akt-dependent fashion. This study demonstrates a new role for PINK1 as a primary upstream activator of Akt via PINK1 kinase-dependent regulation of its primary activator PI(3,4,)P, providing novel mechanistic information on how loss of PINK1 impairs Akt signalling in PD.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.© 2019.

These phenotypic changes have arisen from alterations in the genome/transcriptome, as well as the influence of many external factors on growth performance including nutrition, environment, and management. To investigate the phenotypic changes resulting from genetic selection for increased body weight, The Ohio State University maintains 2 unique genetic turkey lines: the randombred control (RBC2) line, which is comprised of genetics from 1960 era commercial turkeys and has been maintained without conscious selection for any trait; and the F line, which was originally selected from the RBC2 line and has been selected for increased 16 wk body weight for over 50 generations. This study used broad-spectrum mass-spectrometry profiling techniques to identify and quantify differences in the metabolome of the serum of F and RBC2 turkey lines. Serum samples from both F and RBC2 turkeys were subject to quantitative time of flight liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analyses. Principle component analyses showed distinct populations of metabolites in the F vs. RBC2 serum, suggesting that increased body weight is associated with the accumulation of several metabolites. Comparing the spectral features to online databases resulted in the selection of 104 features with potentially identifiable chemical structures. Of these 104 features, 25 were found at higher levels in the serum of the RBC2 line turkeys, while 79 were found at a greater abundance in the F line turkeys. A more detailed analysis of these 104 features allowed for the putative identification of 49 compounds, which were clustered into 6 functional groups: 1) energy ; 2) vitamins; 3) hormones and signaling molecules; 4)  derivatives, fatty acid metabolites, and membrane components; ) amino acid/protein ; and 6) microbial metabolites.

Participants were interviewed for lifestyle habits and medical history. Anthropometrics and biochemical markers were taken. Logistic regression was used to assess CVD morbidity and Cox proportional-hazard model for mortality.The most common genotype in the cohort was ApoE E3 (76.3%), with the other two almost equally distributed (ApoE E2 11.2% and ApoE E4 12.%). In men only, ApoE E4 associated with CVD (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.46, 95%CI 0.76, 2.80) and with 18-year mortality (adjusted HR (aHR) =1.47, 95%CI 0.95, 2.26), adjusting for age, ethnicity, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and -lowering medications. Low levels of HDL cholesterol, adjusted for ApoE and the above mentioned variables, associated with higher prevalence of CVD (aOR=1.35, 95%CI 1.00, 1.83) and all-cause mortality (aHR=1.42, 95%CI 1.14, 1.78).

Here, we used proteomics to identify proteins associated with Kv2/VAP-containing ER-PM junctions. We found that the VAP-interacting membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) transfer proteins PYK2 N-terminal domain-interacting receptor 2 (Nir2) and Nir3 specifically associate with Kv2.1 complexes. When co-expressed with Kv2.1 and VAPA in HEK293T cells, Nir2 co-localized with cell-surface conducting and nonconducting Kv2.1 isoforms, enhanced by muscarinic-mediated PtdIns(4,)P2 hydrolysis, leading to dynamic recruitment of Nir2 to Kv2.1 clusters. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, exogenously expressed Nir2 did not strongly co-localize with Kv2.1, unless exogenous VAPA was also expressed, supporting the notion that VAPA mediates between Kv2.1 and Nir2. Immunolabeling signals of endogenous Kv2.1, Nir2, and VAP puncta were spatially correlated in cultured neurons. Fluorescence-recovery-after-photobleaching experiments revealed that Kv2.1, VAPA, and Nir2 have comparable turnover rates at ER-PM junctions, suggesting that they form complexes at these sites. Exogenous Kv2.1 expression in HEK293T cells resulted in significant differences in the kinetics of PtdIns(4,)P2 recovery following repetitive muscarinic stimulation, with no apparent impact on resting PtdIns(4,)P2 or PtdIns4P levels. Finally, the brains of Kv2.1-knockout mice had altered composition of PtdIns lipids, suggesting a crucial role for native Kv2.1-containing ER-PM junctions in regulating PtdIns  in brain neurons. These results suggest that ER-PM junctions formed by Kv2 channel-VAP pairing regulate PtdIns  homeostasis via VAP-associated PtdIns transfer proteins.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534622>Antiobesity, Regulation of , and Attenuation of Liver Oxidative Stress Effects of Hydroxy--sanshool Isolated from  on High- Diet-Induced Hyperlipidemic Rats.</a></h2><p> is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used to relieve pain, dispel dampness, stop diarrhea, and prevent itching. The aim of this study was to investigate the antiobesity and hypolipidemic effects of hydroxy--sanshool (HAS) isolated from  on hyperlipidemic rats. Wistar rats ( = 48) were randomly divided into six groups: (1) normal diet rats (ND), (2) high- diet- (HFD-) treated rats, (3) HFD+fenofibrate-treated rats (HFD+FNB), (4) HFD+low dose of HAS-treated rats (HFD+LD, 9 mg/kg), () HFD+middle dose of HAS-treated rats (HFD+MD, 18 mg/kg), and (6) HFD+high dose of HAS-treated rats (HFD+HD, 36 mg/kg). The body weight and food intake of the rats were recorded during the treatment period. After 4 weeks of HAS treatment, abdominal adipose tissues were observed and total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) of serum and liver tissues were determined. Furthermore, histochemical examinations using oil red O and hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E) were carried out and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver were determined. After HFD feeding, the body weight gain and food efficiency ratio of HFD rats were significantly enhanced ( < 0.05 ND rats) and HAS treatment (18 and 36 mg/kg) significantly decreased the body weight gain and food efficiency ratio ( < 0.05 HFD rats). In addition, HAS treatment could decrease the abdominal adipose tissues and liver adipocytes. Furthermore, HAS treatment significantly decreased the T-CHO, TG, and LDL-C, whereas it increased HDL-C ( < 0.05 HFD rats) in serum and the liver. HAS treatment increased the GSH level and SOD activity in the liver ( < 0.05 HFD rats), whereas it decreased the levels of MDA ( < 0.05 HFD rats). mRNA analyses suggested that HAS treatment increases the expression of  (proliferator-activated receptor ) and  (peroxisome apolipoprotein E). Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting indicated that HAS stimulation increased the levels of PPAR and APOE in the liver, as a stress response of the body defense system. These results revealed that HAS exerts antiobesity and hypolipidemic activities in HFD rats by reducing liver oxidative stress and thus could be considered as a potential candidate drug to cure or prevent obesity and hyperlipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652245>Exercise Effects on Mitochondrial Function and Lipid  during Energy Balance.</a></h2><p>Aerobic exercise training (AET) has been shown to improve mitochondrial bioenergetics and upregulate proteins related to lipid . However, it remains to be determined if these alterations associated with AET persist when measured in energy balance (EB) in the days following the last bout of training. . The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that improvements in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function induced by AET observed in previous literature would persist when measured after restoring EB conditions 72 hours removed from the last exercise bout.Participants were 14 premenopausal women (age = 31.2 ± 6.7 years, BMI = 26.6 ± .1 kg/m). The AET program required 3 monitored training sessions per week for 8-16 weeks. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and following 8-16 weeks of AET (≥72 hrs after the last exercise bout). All food was provided for 72 hours prior to biopsies and EB was managed 24 hours prior to testing within ±100 kcal of measured energy requirements using a whole-room calorimeter. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity was quantified in permeabilized muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis.We found that AET increased coupled respiration (154%) and uncoupled respiration (90%) rates using a fatty acid substrate (palmitoyl carnitine) (P<0.05). However, when rates were normalized to complex IV activity (a marker of mitochondrial content), no significant differences were observed. Additionally, there were no changes in proteins known to mediate mitochondrial biogenesis or lipid transport and  following AET.8-16 weeks of AET improved mitochondrial capacity under fatty acid substrate when assessed in EB, which appears to be due to mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548065>Associations between body condition score at parturition and microRNA profile in colostrum of dairy cows as evaluated by paired mapping programs.</a></h2><p>MicroRNA (miRNA) are abundant in milk, and likely have regulatory activity involving lactation and immunity. The objective of this study was to determine the miRNA profile in colostrum of overconditioned cows compared with cows of more moderate body condition score (BCS) at calving. Multiparous cows with either high (≥4.0 on a scale of 1 to ; n = 7) or moderate BCS (2.75 to 3.50; n = 9) in the week before parturition were selected from a commercial dairy herd. Blood and colostrum were sampled within 24 h after calving. Blood serum was analyzed for free fatty acid (FFA) concentration. MicroRNA was isolated from colostrum samples after removing milk  and cells. MicroRNA were sequenced, and reads were mapped to the bovine genome and to the existing database of miRNA at miRBase.org. Two programs, Oasis 2.0 and miRDeep2, were employed in parallel for read alignment, and analysis of miRNA count data was performed using DESeq2. Identification of differentially expressed miRNA from DESeq2 was not affected by the differences in miRNA detected by the 2 mapping programs. Most abundant miRNA included miR-30a, miR-148a, miR-181a, let-7f, miR-26a, miR-21, miR-22, and miR-92a. Large-scale shifts in miRNA profile were not observed; however, colostrum of cows with high BCS contained less miR-486, which has been linked with altered glucose . Colostrum from cows with elevated serum FFA contained less miR-885, which may be connected to hepatic function during the transition period. Potential functions of abundant miRNA suggest involvement in development and maintenance of cellular function in the mammary gland, with the additional possibility of influencing neonatal tissue and immune system development.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The mechanisms by which hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gasotransmitter, regulates  remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate if the protective effects of H2S during high glucose (HG)‑induced  accumulation in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes may be mediated by AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK). Triglyceride (TG) content and the production of H2S were determined using adipogenesis colorimetric assay kits and H2S synthesis methods. The levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 and adiponectin were evaluated by ELISA. Total AMPK and phosphorylated AMPK levels were assessed by western blot analysis. HG increased the cellular level of TG and decreased H2S production in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. The H2S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) protected against the HG‑induced accumulation of TG in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, NaHS suppressed HG‑induced TG accumulation by activating AMPK. Collectively, the findings of the present study suggested that HG induced  accumulation in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes, and AMPK activation may underlie the ‑lowering effects of H2S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615047>Upregulated microRNA-106a Promotes Porcine Preadipocyte Proliferation and Differentiation by Targeting Different Genes.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue is one of the main organs for the energy storage and supply of organisms.

We took a three-pronged approach-evaluating human type 2 diabetes (T2D), high- diet (HFD)-fed mice, and in vitro cultured myotubes-to address this. Blood samples were collected from both T2D patients and control subjects; skeletal muscle and blood samples were collected from HFD-fed mice with or without VK supplementation (1, 3, and  µg/kg BW, 8 weeks); and the molecular mechanism of cGas6 was dissected using GGCX, Gas6, AXL, or IR siRNA-transfected cultured myotubes. Plasma cGas6 and VK were significantly lower in T2D patients compared with control; and cGas6 and the cGas6/Gas6 ratio were positively correlated with VK and inversely correlated with fasting glucose in T2D patients, suggesting an important role for plasma VK and cGas6 in maintaining glucose homeostasis in T2D. Animal studies revealed that VK supplementation dose-dependently upregulated plasma cGas6; stimulated the protein expression of cGas6, PI3K, pAKT, and GLUT4 in skeletal muscle; and reduced hyperglycemia in HFD-fed T2D mice. And in vitro mRNA knockdown studies demonstrated the requirement of cGas6 in mediating the positive effect of VK on glucose  via stimulating the PI3K/pAKT/GLUT4 signaling pathway in high glucose-treated myotubes. These results demonstrate a significant involvement of cGas6 in mediating the beneficial effect of VK on regulating glucose homeostasis in T2D.© 2019 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628477> links nutrient-exercise timing to insulin sensitivity in men classified as overweight or obese.</a></h2><p>Pre-exercise nutrient availability alters acute metabolic responses to exercise, which could modulate training responsiveness.To assess acute and chronic effects of exercise performed before versus after nutrient ingestion on whole-body and intramuscular  utilization, and postprandial glucose .1) Acute, randomised, crossover design (Acute Study); 2) 6-week, randomised, controlled design (Training Study).General community.Men with overweight/obesity (mean±SD, BMI: 30.2±3. kg.m-2 for Acute Study, 30.9±4. kg.m-2 for Training Study).Moderate-intensity cycling performed before versus after mixed-macronutrient breakfast (Acute Study) or carbohydrate (Training Study) ingestion.Acute Study - exercise before versus after breakfast consumption increased net intramuscular  utilization in type I (net change: -3.44±2.63% versus 1.44±4.18% area  staining, p < 0.01) and type II fibres (-1.89±2.48% versus 1.83±1.92% area  staining, p < 0.05). Training Study - postprandial glycemia was not differentially affected by 6-weeks of exercise training performed before versus after carbohydrate intake (p>0.05). However, postprandial insulinemia was reduced with exercise training performed before, but not after carbohydrate ingestion (p=0.03). This resulted in increased oral glucose insulin sensitivity (25±38 vs -21±32 mL.min-1.m-2; p=0.01), associated with increased  utilization during exercise (r=0.50, p=0.02). Regular exercise before nutrient provision also augmented remodelling of skeletal muscle phospholipids and protein content of the glucose transport protein GLUT4 (p<0.05).Experiments investigating exercise training and metabolic health should consider nutrient-exercise timing, and exercise performed before versus after nutrient intake (i.e., in the fasted state) may exert beneficial effects on  utilisation and reduce postprandial insulinemia.© Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514491>The Effect of the Pubertal Stage on Irisin Levels in Male Adolescents: A Novel Myokine</a></h2><p>Irisin is a recently discovered protein and is defined as adipomyokine. The relation of irisin with carbohydrate  and other hormone parameters have been investigated; however, studies evaluating the relationship between irisin and puberty are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the levels of circulating irisin during different pubertal stages in male adolescents.The study included pubertal male adolescents between the ages of 13 -14   with normal weight, who had entered puberty. Fasting serum irisin levels were evaluated, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was used to measure body  ratio (BFR) and -free mass (FFM). BFR was also calculated by measuring the thickness of the triceps subcutaneous  with a caliper.Sixty-eight adolescents were enrolled. The number of adolescents in pubertal stage 2, 3, 4 and  were n = 17 (25%), n = 13 (19.1%), n = 21 (30.1%) and n = 17 (25%), respectively. The levels of circulating irisin did not differ according to the pubertal stage. Additionally, there was no significant relationship between irisin levels and body  percentage or FFM.Irisin levels do not differ after the onset of puberty thereafter with the progressing pubertal maturation.

However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects on body composition.To compare the long-term effects of weight loss via severe vs moderate energy restriction on lean mass and other aspects of body composition.The Type of Energy Manipulation for Promoting Optimum Metabolic Health and Body Composition in Obesity (TEMPO) Diet Trial was a 12-month, single-center, randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least  years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%) energy restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%) energy restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate energy restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual body weight per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole-body lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were body weight, thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and  mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.2] years; mean [SD] weight, 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.4 [2.]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more weight (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8.2 to -.1 kg), lost more whole-body lean mass (effect size, -1.2 kg; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4.2 cm2; 95% CI, -6. to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total weight loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole-body  mass (effect size, -. kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe energy restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole-body lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate energy restriction and was associated with 2-fold greater weight and  loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate energy restriction.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of phosSNPs on  levels and RA.We examined the association of phosSNPs with  levels and RA in large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and performed random sampling and fgwas analyses to determine whether the phosSNPs associated with  levels and RA were significantly enriched. Furthermore, we performed QTL analysis and Mendelian randomization analysis to obtain additional evidence to be associated with the identified phosSNPs and genes.We found 483 phosSNPs for  levels and 243 phosSNPs for RA in the GWAS loci (P < 1.0 × 10-). SNPs associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Total cholesterol (TC) and RA were significantly enriched with phosSNPs. Almost all of the identified phosSNPs showed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) effects. A total of 48 protein QTLs and 9 metabolite QTLs were found. The phosSNP rs3184504 (p.Trp262Arg) at SH2B3 was significantly associated with RA, SH2B3 expression level, and plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TC, hypoxanthine and 80 proteins, including beta-2-microglobulin. SH2B3 was differentially expressed between RA cases and controls in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and synovial tissues. Mendelian randomization analysis showed that SH2B3 expression level was significantly associated with TC level and RA. Plasma beta-2-microglobulin level was causally associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TC levels and RA.The findings suggested that phosSNPs may play important roles in  and the pathological mechanisms of RA.

Serum and hepatic  profiles, and glucose tolerance were measured. Fecal BA composition was determined through ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The gene expression of BA synthase in the liver and farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated BA negative feedback regulation pathway in the liver and ileum were analyzed via RNA analysis.HFCCD resulted in abnormal cholesterol levels in the serum and liver. LF intervention significantly increased the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 24.9% and decreased the hepatic total cholesterol content by 26%. LF treatment significantly increased the BA content per gram by 109.8%, the total amount of BA excretion by 153.% and conjugated BAs by 87.6% in the feces. Furthermore, LF upregulated the expression of the hepatic sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) gene, which expresses important enzymes in the classical pathway of BA synthesis, and the bile acid-CoA amino acid N-acetyltransferase (BAAT) gene, which is responsible for the formation of conjugated BAs.

Determining the optimal levels of nutrient supplies to cultures can eliminate feeding of excess nutrients, lowering production costs and reducing nutrient pollution into the environment. With the advent of omics and bioinformatics methods, it is now possible to construct genome-scale models that accurately describe the  of microorganisms. In this study, a genome-scale model of the green alga  (CZ946) was applied to predict feeding of multiple nutrients, including nitrate and glucose, under both autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. The objective function was changed from optimizing growth to instead minimizing nitrate and glucose uptake rates, enabling predictions of feed rates for these nutrients. The metabolic model control (MMC) algorithm was validated for autotrophic growth, saving 18% nitrate while sustaining algal growth. Additionally, we obtained similar growth profiles by simultaneously controlling glucose and nitrate supplies under heterotrophic conditions for both high and low levels of glucose and nitrate. Finally, the nitrate supply was controlled in order to retain protein and chlorophyll synthesis, albeit at a lower rate, under nitrogen-limiting conditions. This model-driven cultivation strategy doubled the total volumetric yield of biomass, increased fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield by 61%, and enhanced lutein yield nearly 3 fold compared to nitrogen starvation. This study introduces a control methodology that integrates omics data and genome-scale models in order to optimize nutrient supplies based on the metabolic state of algal cells in different nutrient environments. This approach could transform bioprocessing control into a systems biology-based paradigm suitable for a wide range of species in order to limit nutrient inputs, reduce processing costs, and optimize biomanufacturing for the next generation of desirable biotechnology products.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554665>Metabolic Disturbances of a High- Diet Are Dependent on APOE Genotype and Sex.</a></h2><p>Apolipoprotein E4 () is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD).  is also associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome.

The mechanism and related  of RO and its main metabolites against lipid disorder were related to the up-regulation of the phosphorylation of adenosine '-monophosphate(AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the inhibition of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) cracking into the nucleus, following the down-regulation of fatty acid synthesis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that RA and CA are active substances of RO, and provides scientific evidence to support functional food product development for improving NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666479>Diosgenin Supplementation Prevents  Accumulation and Induces Skeletal Muscle-Fiber Hypertrophy in Rats.</a></h2><p>Diosgenin (Dio) is a steroid sapogenin found in plants such as Dioscorea species, and is recognized as a phytochemical against various disorders as well as a natural precursor of steroidal drugs. The present study used rats fed high-cholesterol (Chol) diets supplemented with or without 0.% Dio for 6 wk to investigate the effects of dietary Dio on . Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile acid content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile acids. A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral  was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Dio may not only induce myoblast fusion and enhance skeletal muscle as an energy expenditure organ, but may also activate the catabolic pathway via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, these effects of Dio on skeletal muscles may contribute to inhibition of visceral  accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527489>A Discovery of Relevant Hepatoprotective Effects and Underlying Mechanisms of Dietary  Against Corticosterone-Induced Liver Injury in Pekin Ducks.</a></h2><p> () can attenuate oxidative stress, inflammation, and hepatic fatty deposition in poultry, however, the underlying mechanisms for this in Pekin ducks remain unclear. This study evaluated these hepatoprotective effects and the underlying mechanisms in a corticosterone (CORT)-induced liver injury model in Pekin ducks fed a  intervention diet. A total of 500 Pekin ducks were randomly divided into five groups: one group (CON group) was only provided with a basal diet, three groups were provided a basal diet with 200 mg/kg (LCB group), 400 mg/kg (MCB group), or 600 mg/kg (HCB group) , respectively, and one group was provided a basal diet with 150 mg/kg aureomycin (ANT group) for 42 d. At 37 days-old, all ducks received daily intraperitoneal injections of CORT for five days to establish a liver injury model.  intervention alleviated liver injury by decreasing the liver organ indices, hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte necrosis, and improving liver function, antioxidant capacity, and inflammatory factors. Hepatic RNA-seq revealed 365 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the MCB and CON groups, with 229 up- and 136 down-regulated DEGs in the MCB group. Between the MCB and ANT groups, 407 DEGs were identified, including 299 up- and 108 down-regulated genes in MCB group. Some DEGs in the MCB group related to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses such as Sod3, , and  which were up-regulated, while , , , , , and , which are involved in , were down-regulated, indicating that these genes were responsive to dietary  for the alleviation of corticosterone-induced hepatic injury. Toll-like receptor signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, adipocytokine and glycerophospholipid  signaling pathway were significantly enriched in the MCB group. These findings indicate that  intervention can protect Pekin ducks from corticosterone-induced liver injury by the modulation of immunoregulatory- and -related genes and pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601019>The Effectiveness of Intermittent Fasting to Reduce Body Mass Index and Glucose : A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>The effects of an intermittent fasting diet (IFD) in the general population are still controversial. In this study, we aimed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of an IFD to reduce body mass index and glucose  in the general population without diabetes mellitus. Cochrane, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared an IFD with a regular diet or a continuous calorie restriction diet. The effectiveness of an IFD was estimated by the weighted mean difference (WMD) for several variables associated with glucometabolic parameters including body mass index (BMI) and fasting glucose. The pooled mean differences of outcomes were calculated using a random effects model. From 2814 studies identified through a literature search, we finally selected 12 articles (545 participants). Compared with a control diet, an IFD was associated with a significant decline in BMI (WMD, -0.75 kg/m; 95% CI, -1.44 to -0.06), fasting glucose level (WMD, -4.16 mg/dL; 95% CI, -6.92 to -1.40), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (WMD, -0.54; 95% CI, -1.05 to -0.03).  mass (WMD, -0.98 kg; 95% CI, -2.32 to 0.36) tended to decrease in the IFD group with a significant increase in adiponectin (WMD, 1008.9 ng/mL; 95% CI, 140. to 1877.3) and a decrease in leptin (WMD, -0.51 ng/mL; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.24) levels.

In this study, we compared the difference in prevalence of elevated and hypertensive BP values defined by the 2017 AAP guideline and the 2004 Fourth Report and estimated the cardiovascular risk associated with the reclassification of BP status defined by the AAP guideline. A total of 47 200 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years from 6 countries (China, India, Iran, Korea, Poland, and Tunisia) were included in this study. Elevated BP and hypertension were defined according to 2 guidelines. In addition, 1606 children from China, Iran, and Korea who were reclassified upward by the AAP guideline compared with the Fourth Report and for whom laboratory data were available were 1:1 matched with children from the same countries who were normotensive by both guidelines. Compared with the Fourth Report, the prevalence of elevated BP defined by the AAP guideline was lower (14.9% versus 8.6%), whereas the prevalence of stages 1 and 2 hypertension was higher (stage 1, 6.6% versus 14.%; stage 2, 0.4% versus 1.7%). Additionally, comparison of laboratory data in the case-control study showed that children who were reclassified upward were more likely to have adverse  profiles and high fasting blood glucose compared with normotensive children. In conclusion, the prevalence of elevated BP and hypertension varied significantly between both guidelines. Applying the new AAP guideline could identify more children with hypertension who are at increased cardiovascular risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544710>Targeting Ceramide  in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: New Points for Therapeutic Intervention.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the greatest global health burdens because of its uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation, aggressive nature as well as inherited chemoresistance. In spite of different treatment options currently available for HCC, the -year relative survival rates for HCC patients with regional and distant stages of disease are still low, which points to the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies for HCC. Recent findings strongly suggest that specific  species, such as sphingolipids, play a prominent role in tumorigenesis.We will give an overview of recent literature findings on the role of ceramide  in the pathogenesis and treatment of HCC.HCC is characterised by dysregulation of ceramide , which could be ascribed to altered activity and expression of ceramide synthases 2, 4 and 6, and acid and alkaline ceramidases 2 and 3, as well as to deregulation of sphingosine kinases (SphK) 1 and 2 and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors, in particular S1PR1. Among these, SphK2 has emerged as a clinically relevant drug target in HCC whose inhibition by ABC294640 is currently being investigated in a clinical trial in patients with advanced HCC. Another promising strategy includes restoration of ceramide levels in HCC tissues, whereby nanoliposomal ceramides, in particular C6-ceramide, has emerged as an effective therapeutic agent against HCC whose safety and recommended dosing is currently being clinically investigated.Development of novel drugs specifically targeting ceramide  could provide an enhanced therapeutic response and improved survival outcome in HCC patients.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670380>Metabolomics study of fasudil on cisplatin-induced kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Fasudil is a derivative of -isoquinoline sulfonamide, which is a Rho kinase inhibitor, a wide range of pharmacological effects. Fasudil has been shown to attenuate kidney injury caused by certain substances. In the present study, metabolomic analysis of mouse kidney tissues ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to determine the metabolomic changes in cisplatin-induced kidney injury and the fasudil-induced attenuation of cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Metabolomic profiling of kidney tissues revealed significant differences in metabolites between the control group and the cisplatin group and between the cisplatin group and the fasudil-intervention group. With metabolomic approach, 68 endogenous differential metabolites were found, and multivariate statistical analysis, accurate molecular weights, isotope tracers, mass-spectrometry secondary-fragment information, and standard-reference comparisons were used to identify these substances. Based on these differential metabolites, a metabolic-pathway network was constructed and revealed that fasudil primarily attenuated cisplatin-induced renal injury by modulating  and amino-acid . These results further demonstrate that kidney injury can be induced by cisplatin and, moreover, suggest that fasudil can be used to reduce kidney injury at early stages in patients treated with cisplatin.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649313>Improving obesity and blood pressure.</a></h2><p>Obesity-associated hypertension is a serious public health concern. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to  disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or  kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related  disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572329>Dramatic Remodeling of the Gut Microbiome Around Parturition and Its Relationship With Host Serum Metabolic Changes in Sows.</a></h2><p>Perinatal care is important in mammals due to its contribution to fetal growth, maternal health, and lactation. Substantial changes in host hormones, , and immunity around the parturition period may be accompanied by alterations in the gut microbiome. However, to our knowledge, changes in the gut microbiome and their contribution to the shifts in host  around parturition have not been investigated in pigs. Furthermore, pigs are an ideal biomedical model for studying the interactions of the gut microbiota with host , due to the ease of controlling feeding conditions. Here we report dramatic remodeling of the gut microbiota and the potential functional capacity during the late stages of pregnancy ( days before parturition, LP) to postpartum (within 6 h after delivery, PO) in both experimental and validated populations of sows ( = 107). The richness of bacteria in the gut of both pregnant and delivery sows significantly decreased, whilst the β-diversity dramatically expanded. The ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes, and the relative abundance of Prevotella significantly decreased, whilst the relative abundance of the predominant genus  significantly increased from LP to PO state. The predicted functional capacities of the gut microbiome related to amino acid , the  of cofactors and vitamins, and glycan biosynthesis were significantly decreased from LP to PO state. However, the abundance of the functional capacities associated with carbohydrate and  were increased. Consistent with these changes, serum metabolites enriched at the LP stage were associated with the  of amino acids and vitamins. In contrast, metabolites enriched at the PO stage were related to .

Here, we induced chronic low-grade ER stress in lean mice to levels similar to those in high- diet (HFD)-fed obese mice and found that it promoted hyperglycemia due to enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis. Mechanistically, sustained ER stress up-regulated the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 (USP14), which increased the stability and levels of 3','-cyclic monophosphate-responsive element binding (CREB) protein (CBP) to enhance glucagon action and hepatic gluconeogenesis. Exogenous overexpression of USP14 in the liver significantly increased hepatic glucose output. Consistent with this, liver-specific knockdown of USP14 abrogated the effects of ER stress on glucose , and also improved hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in obese mice. In conclusion, our findings show a mechanism underlying ER stress-induced disruption of glucose homeostasis, and present USP14 as a potential therapeutic target against T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604978>Plasmodium Infection Induces Dyslipidemia and a Hepatic Lipogenic State in the Host through the Inhibition of the AMPK-ACC Pathway.</a></h2><p>Malaria is a major parasitic disease of humans and is a health public problem that affects more than 100 countries. In 2017, it caused nearly half a million deaths out of 219 million infections. Malaria is caused by the protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium and is transmitted by female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. Once in the bloodstream, Plasmodium merozoites invade erythrocytes and proliferate until the cells lyses and release new parasites that invade other erythrocytes. Remarkably, they can manipulate the vertebrate host's  pathways, since they cannot synthesize  classes that are essential for their development and replication. In this study, we show that mice infected with Plasmodium chabaudi present a completely different plasma profile from control mice, with marked hyperproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypoglycemia, and hypocholesterolemia. In addition, white adipose and hepatic tissue and analyses from infected animals revealed the accumulation of triacylglycerol in both tissues and free fatty acids and free cholesterol in the liver. Hepatic mRNA and protein expression of key enzymes and transcription factors involved in  were also altered by P. chabaudi infection, leading to a lipogenic state. The enzyme ' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cell energetic , was also modulated by the parasite, which reduced AMPK phosphorylation levels upon infection. Pretreatment with metformin for 21 days followed by infection with P. chabaudi was effective in preventing infection of mice and also lowered the hepatic accumulation of lipids while activating AMPK. Together, these results provide new and important information on the specific molecular mechanisms induced by the malaria parasite to regulate hepatic  in order to facilitate its development, proliferation, and lifespan in its vertebrate host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666643>Empagliflozin and Dulaglutide are Effective against Obesity-induced Airway Hyperresponsiveness and Fibrosis in A Murine Model.</a></h2><p>Patients with asthma with obesity experience severe symptoms, are unresponsive to conventional asthma treatment, and lack proper pharmacotherapy. Empagliflozin and dulaglutide, developed for diabetes, reduce weight, decrease insulin resistance, and exert additive effects. We evaluated the efficacy of empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination on obesity-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung fibrosis using a murine model. We assigned C57BL/6J mice to five groups: control, high- diet (HFD), and HFD with empagliflozin, dulaglutide, or both. Mice received a 12-week HFD, empagliflozin ( days/week, oral gavage), and dulaglutide (once weekly, intraperitoneally). Both drugs significantly attenuated HFD-induced weight increase, abnormal glucose , and abnormal serum levels of leptin and insulin, and co-treatment was more effective. Both drugs significantly alleviated HFD-induced AHR, increased macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and co-treatment was more effective on AHR. HFD-induced lung fibrosis was decreased by both drugs alone and combined. HFD induced interleukin (IL)-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-1β mRNA and protein expression, which was significantly reduced by empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 showed similar patterns without significant differences. HFD-enhanced T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell differentiation was improved by both drugs.

The extraction yield of betacyanins was optimized by response surface methodology. The optimal PHWE conditions were attained and the actual yields of betacyanins under optimal conditions were well matched with the predicted yields. In addition, betacyanin pigment compositions as well as superoxide anion scavenging activity of individual betacyanins extract (BE) produced in optimal PHWE conditions were characterized by HPLC-ESI/MS and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of three BEs on oleic acid-induced steatohepatitis in cellular model was comparatively investigated. The results showed that unlike PFP, RBS, and CPP presented excellent efficacy in decreasing intracellular triglyceride and reactive oxygen species, inhibiting the release of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase as well as regulating fatty acid synthase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 mRNAs expression. Practical applications In this study, PHWE, is firstly proposed for the enhancement of the extraction of betacyanins from three agricultural by-products.

We analyzed the contribution of gluten on obesity and the effects of prebiotics -arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)- that can be extracted from gluten-containing cereals.Mice were fed a control diet, Western diet (WD, consisting of high /high sucrose), or WD with % gluten. Prebiotics were tested in the WD with gluten. Gluten did not increase body weight or intestinal permeability and had a minor effect on ileal inflammation. Gluten decreased the expression of browning markers in the , and increased the triglycerides synthesis in the muscle. AXOS decreased body weight and adiposity in  pads muscle and liver compared to the WD plus gluten. AXOS promoted gluten cleavage by the induction of prolyl endopeptidase that was translated into a reduction of gluten immunogenic peptides. Gluten had minor effects on cecal microbiota composition, whereas prebiotics increased Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Prevotella and Parasutterella, all negatively correlated to the cecal content of gluten peptides.While gluten may affect metabolic homeostasis, these effects are lessened when gluten is consumed along with cereal-derived fibers.

We screened targeted sequencing data of 632 patients with severe HTG and identified partial deletions of the  gene, encoding the central enzyme involved in the  of TG-rich lipoproteins, in four individuals (0.63%). We confirmed the genomic breakpoints in each patient with Sanger sequencing. Three patients carried an identical heterozygous deletion spanning the ' untranslated region (UTR) to  exon 2, and one patient carried a heterozygous deletion spanning the 'UTR to  exon 1. All four heterozygous CNV carriers were determined to have multifactorial severe HTG. The predicted null nature of our identified  deletions may contribute to relatively higher TG levels and a more severe clinical phenotype than other forms of genetic variation associated with the disease, particularly in the polygenic state. The identification of novel CNVs in patients with severe HTG suggests that methods for CNV detection should be included in the diagnostic workup and molecular genetic evaluation of patients with high TG levels.Copyright © 2019 Dron et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves  and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of  in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without diabetes. Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term ( weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites,  and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for  weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, -lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total  concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in -lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

Unlike other angiosperm plants such as  and rice that have physical barriers between their photosynthetic organs and soils, the photosynthetic organs of duckweeds face directly to their nutrient suppliers (waters), therefore, their responses to salinity may be distinct. In this research, we found that the duckweed  L. accumulated high content of sodium and reduced potassium and calcium contents in large amounts under salt stress. Fresh weight, Rubisco and AGPase activities, and starch content were significantly decreaseded in the first day but recovered gradually in the following days and accumulated more starch than control from Day 3 to Day  when treated with 100 mM and 150 mM NaCl. A total of 2156 differentially expressed genes were identified. Overall, the genes related to ethylene , major CHO degradation,  degradation, N-, secondary  of flavonoids, and abiotic stress were significantly increased, while those involved in cell cycle and organization, cell wall, mitochondrial electron transport of ATP synthesis, light reaction of photosynthesis, auxin , and tetrapyrrole synthesis were greatly inhibited. Moreover, salt stress also significantly influenced the expression of transcription factors that are mainly involved in abiotic stress and cell differentiation. However, most of the osmosensing calcium antiporters (OSCA) and the potassium inward channels were downregulated, Na/H antiporters (SOS1 and NHX) and a Na/Ca exchanger were slightly upregulated, but most of them did not respond significantly to salt stress. These results indicated that the ion homeostasis was strongly disturbed. Finally, the shared and distinct regulatory networks of salt stress responses between duckweeds and other plants were intensively discussed. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of salt stress response in duckweeds, and can be served as a useful foundation for salt tolerance improvement of duckweeds for the application in salinity conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520525>No effect of triheptanoin on exercise performance in McArdle disease.</a></h2><p>To study if treatment with triheptanoin, a 7-carbon triglyceride, improves exercise tolerance in patients with McArdle disease. McArdle patients have a complete block in glycogenolysis and glycogen-dependent expansion of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), which may restrict  oxidation. We hypothesized that triheptanoin  generates substrates for the TCA, which potentially boosts  oxidation and improves exercise tolerance in McArdle disease.Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in patients with McArdle disease completing two treatment periods of 14 days each with a triheptanoin or placebo diet (1 g/kg/day). Primary outcome was change in mean heart rate during 20 min submaximal exercise on a cycle ergometer. Secondary outcomes were change in peak workload and oxygen uptake along with changes in blood metabolites and respiratory quotients.Nineteen of 22 patients completed the trial. Malate levels rose on triheptanoin treatment versus placebo (8.0 ± SD2.3 vs. . ± SD1.8 µmol/L, P < 0.001), but dropped from rest to exercise (P < 0.001). There was no difference in exercise heart rates between triheptanoin (120 ± SD16 bpm) and placebo (121 ± SD16 bpm) treatments. Compared with placebo, triheptanoin did not change the submaximal respiratory quotient (0.82 ± SD0.05 vs. 0.84 ± SD0.03), peak workload (105 ± SD38 vs. 102 ± SD31 Watts), or peak oxygen uptake (1938 ± SD499 vs. 1977 ± SD380 mL/min).Despite increased resting plasma malate with triheptanoin, the increase was insufficient to generate a normal TCA turnover during exercise and the treatment has no effect on exercise capacity or oxidative  in patients with McArdle disease.© 2019 The Authors.

The liver is the principal site for the 25(OH)VD biosynthesis. This study investigated whether GSH deficiency induces epigenetic alterations that impair Vitamin D (VD)  genes in the livers of HFD-fed mice. The expression of the VD  genes CYP2R1 and CYP27A1 (25-hydroxylase), CYP27B1 (1-α-hydroxylase), and vitamin D receptor (VDR) were downregulated in the livers of mice fed an HFD (GSH- deficient) compared with control diet-fed group. The expression of CYP24A1 (24-hydroxylase) was significantly increased, which catabolizes both 25(OH)VD and 1α,25-hydroxyvitaminD. Gene-specific hypermethylation of 25-hydroxylase, 1-α-hydroxylase, and VDR, and hypomethylation of CYP24A1 was observed in HFD-fed mice. GSH deficiency induced in cultured hepatocytes caused an increase in oxidative stress and alterations in VD regulatory genes. Similarly, elevated global DNA methylation, Dnmt activity, and -methylcytosine but decreased Tet activity and -hydroxymethylcytosine were observed in the GSH-deficient hepatocytes and the liver of HFD-fed mice. Replenishment of GSH by its prodrugs treatment beneficially altered epigenetic enzymes, and VD- genes in hepatocytes. HFD-induces GSH deficiency and epigenetically alters VD-biosynthesis pathway genes. This provides a biochemical mechanism for the VD-deficiency and potential benefits of GSH treatment in reducing 25(OH)VD-deficiency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657926>Digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-enriched phosphoethanolamine plasmalogens based on gastrointestinal functions in healthy mice.</a></h2><p>EPA-enriched phosphoethanolamine plasmalogens (EPA-pPE), widely present in marine creatures, is a unique glycerophospholipid with EPA at the sn-2 position of glycerol backbone. EPA-pPE has been reported to exhibit numerous distinctive bioactivities. However, the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE in vivo are not clear, which restrict the molecular mechanism analysis related to its distinctive activities. The aim of the present study was to illustrate the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE by lipid analysis in serum, intestinal wall and content after oral administration of EPA-pPE emulsion. Results showed the EPA percentage of total fatty acids in serum was increasing over time, with two peaks at  and 10 h by 1.89±0.2 and 2.58±0.27, respectively, then fell from 1.89±0.17 at 10h to 1.35±0.16 at16h. In small intestinal content, EPA-pPE was hydrolyzed to lyso-phospholipids and EPA by phospholipases A2, the vinyl ether bond was retained at the sn-1 position. The released EPA could be quickly taken up into the enterocytes and enter circulation. The comparison of simulated digestion in vitro showed that the distinct digestion and absorption process of EPA-pPE was a unique phenomenon. EPA could be retained in serum at high level for a substantial period of time, which suggested us that EPA-pPE was not just a short-lived circulating molecular.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529298>Lipolytic Activity and the Utilization of Fatty Acids Associated with Bat Sebum by Pseudogymnoascus destructans.</a></h2><p>Pseudogymnoascus destructans is the causative agent of a fungal infection of bats known as white-nose syndrome (WNS). Since its discovery in 2006, it has been responsible for precipitous declines of several species of cave-dwelling North American bats. While numerous advancements in the understanding of the disease processes underlying WNS have been made in recent years, there are still many aspects of WNS, particularly with respect to pathogen virulence, that remain unknown. In this preliminary investigation, we sought to further elucidate the disease cycle by concentrating on the pathogen, with specific focus on its ability to utilize lipids that compose bat wing sebum and are found in wing membranes, as a substrate for energy and growth. In vitro growth experiments were conducted with the three most common fatty acids that comprise bat sebum: oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids. None of the fatty acids were observed to contribute a significant difference in mean growth from controls grown on SDA, although morphological differences were observed in several instances. Additionally, as an accompaniment to the growth experiments, bat wing explants from Perimyotis subflavus and Eptesicus fuscus were fluorescently stained to visualize the difference in distribution of 16- and 18-carbon chain fatty acids in the wing membrane. Which substrates contribute to the growth of P. destructans is important to understanding the progressive impact P. destructans has on bat health through the course of the disease cycle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608013>Sex-Based Differences in Diabetes Prevalence and Risk Factors: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study Among Low-Income Adults in China.</a></h2><p> The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) among adults has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, including China. In China, sex-based differences in the prevalence and risk factors of DM may exist, particularly among low-income individuals. Thus, we assessed these differences in the prevalence of DM and its risk factors in a low-income Chinese population.  Residents aged ≥45 years without histories of strokes or cardiovascular disease were recruited for this study. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association of risk factors with DM prevalence.  This study included 3,725 participants (41.2%, men; 58.8%, women). The mean age of the women (61.12 years) was higher than that of the men (59.14 years,  < 0.001). There was no significant sex-based difference in DM prevalence (men, 14.1%; women, 14.%). Overweight, obesity, high triglyceride levels, and hypertension were independent risk factors for DM in both sexes. However, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were negatively associated with DM risk among men [odds ratio (OR), 0.544; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.355-0.833;  = 0.005]. Among women, advanced age and high low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were independent risk factors for DM; there was a higher DM risk for women aged 55-74 years than for those aged 45-54 years; however, physical activity was associated with an increased risk of DM (OR, 1.705; 95% CI, 1.195-2.432;  = 0.003).  These findings suggest a crucial need to implement individualized blood pressure, weight, and  managements in low-income populations in China to reduce the burden of DM, especially among older women.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Ni, Yu, Wu, Li, Liu, Tu, Ning, He and Wang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569469>Transcriptome Sequencing and Metabolome Analysis Reveal Genes Involved in Pigmentation of Green-Colored Cotton Fibers.</a></h2><p>Green-colored fiber (GCF) is the unique raw material for naturally colored cotton textile but we know little about the pigmentation process in GCF. Here we compared transcriptomes and metabolomes of 12, 18 and 24 days post-anthesis (DPA) fibers from a green fiber cotton accession and its white-colored fiber (WCF) near-isogenic line. We found a total of 2047 non-redundant metabolites in GCF and WCF that were enriched in 80 pathways, including those of biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid, cutin, suberin, and wax. Most metabolites, particularly sinapaldehyde, of the phenylpropanoid pathway had a higher level in GCF than in WCF, consistent with the significant up-regulation of the genes responsible for biosynthesis of those metabolites. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of genes differentially expressed between GCF and WCF was used to uncover gene-modules co-expressed or associated with the accumulation of green pigments. Of the 16 gene-modules co-expressed with fiber color or time points, the blue module associated with G24 (i.e., GCF at 24 DPA) was of particular importance because a large proportion of its genes were significantly up-regulated at 24 DPA when fiber color was visually distinguishable between GCF and WCF. A total of 56 hub genes, including the two homoeologous Gh4CL4 that could act in green pigment biosynthesis, were identified among the genes of the blue module that are mainly involved in , phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, RNA transcription, signaling, and transport. Our results provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying pigmentation of green fibers and clues for developing cottons with stable green colored fibers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516524>The Effect of Nutritional Education Based on Health Belief Model on Nutritional Knowledge, Health Belief Model Constructs, and Dietary Intake in Hemodialysis Patients.</a></h2><p>Based on the results of many studies on the relationship between nutritional status and clinical implications in dialysis patients, malnutrition is one of the most important factors associated with mortality in these patients. The current study examined the effect of nutritional education based on Health Belief Model (HBM) on nutritional knowledge, HBM constructs, and dietary intake in Hemodialysis (HD) patients.One-hundred chronic HD patients entered to this randomized clinical trial in 2017 in Iran; 41 in control group and 45 in intervention group completed the study. Demographic data and four 24-h recalls were collected. To evaluate the nutritional knowledge and HBM constructs, a researcher-made questionnaire was used. Patients were evaluated before, immediately after, and 3 months after intervention. Eight 1-h education sessions in 4 weeks were considered for intervention group. Independent samples -test, Chi-square test, and repeated measures ANOVA were used to analyze the data.Repeated measures ANOVA test showed significant increases in scores of the nutritional knowledge test, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barriers ( = < 0.001), perceived benefits ( = 0.010), and self-efficacy ( = 0.019) after the study in the intervention group. There were no significant differences between two groups in energy, protein, High Biologic Value (HBV) protein, carbohydrate, , cholesterol, fiber, vitamin B2, B3, B6, B12, E, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium intake.It seems that education based on HBM can improve nutritional knowledge but in order to influence on dietary intake, longer interventions that are more comprehensive are needed.</p></html>
