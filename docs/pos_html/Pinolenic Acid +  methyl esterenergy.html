<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19318230>Discrimination among geometrical isomers of alpha- using low  electron ionization mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>There is a consensus that electron impact ionization mass spectrometry is not capable of discriminating among geometrical isomers of unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (and in general olefinic compounds). In this paper, we report the identification of all eight geometrical isomers of alpha-linolenic acid, one of the few essential omega-3 fatty acids that has attracted great attention, using low- electron ionization mass spectrometry. Three electron energies 70, 50, and 30 eV were studied and the mass spectrum of each isomer was obtained from the analysis of different concentrations of a standard mixture of alpha- geometrical isomers to ensure the robustness of the method. Principal component analysis was employed to model the complex variation of m/z intensities across the isomers. Only using the data of 30 eV  was complete differentiation among geometrical isomers observed. The unique cleavage pattern of the alpha- isomers leading to a benzenium ion structure is discussed and general fragmentation rules are derived using the mass spectra of over 300 compounds with different kinds and levels of unsaturation. Application of the proposed method is not limited to alpha-linolenic acid. It can potentially be used to identify the geometrical isomers of any compounds with an olefinic chain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1263777>Nutritional effects of the cyclic monomers of  in the rat.</a></h2><p>Low levels (0.0075, 0.0225, and 0.15%) of cyclic fatty acid methyl esters (greater than 98% pure) were incorporated into diets of weanling rats fed different levels of protein. Animals on low protein diets (8-10% casein) exhibited decreased wt gains and feed consumption with increasing levels of cyclic esters in their diets after 6 weeks. Liver enlargements due to a significant (P less than 0.01) accumulation of liver lipid were noted in animals receiving 0.15% cyclic fatty acid esters in their diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820744>Chemical composition, in vitro gas production, methane production and fatty acid profile of canola silage (Brassica napus) with four levels of molasses.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of four levels of molasses on chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, methane production and fatty acid profile of canola silages. A canola (Brassica napus var. Monty) crop was established in a small-scale agricultural farm and harvested 148 days after sowing. Four levels of molasses were tested with respect to the fresh weight (1.5 kg); these were 1% (CS-1), 2% (CS-2), 3% (CS-3) and 4% (CS-4) molasses, and 0% molasses (CS-0) was included as a control. A total of 45 microsilages were prepared using PVC pipes (4 in. of diameter × 20 cm of length), and the forage was compressed using a manual press. The effects of control and treatments were tested using the general linear model Y = μ + T + E. The linolenic acid (C18:3n3), palmitic acid (C16:0) and linoleic acid methyl ester (C18:2n6c) accounted for 30%, 21% and 10.5% of total fatty acids, respectively; the fermentation parameters and in vitro methane production were not affected (P > 0.05) by treatments; in vitro digestibility decreased significantly (P < 0.05) as the level of molasses increased. It was concluded that CS-4 improved the DM content by 9% and showed high content of . The gross  of canola silages could favour the oleic acid methyl ester.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19146461>Determination of the composition of fatty acid mixtures using GC x FI-MS: a comprehensive two-dimensional separation approach.</a></h2><p>Gas chromatography using a highly polar column combined with field ionization mass spectrometry (FI-MS) is used as a comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) separation approach to analyze mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). A unique ordered pattern and classification of FAMEs is obtained in a 2D GC x FI-MS separation plot based on the number of carbons, the degree of unsaturation, and a combination of both by which the geometrical, positional, and structural isomers group together. FAMEs with different chain length but identical geometry, position, and degree of unsaturation follow linear patterns. These subclassifications (linear functions) can provide information about the geometry, position, and structure of unsaturation of an unknown FAME. Non-FAMEs and FAMEs with different functional groups are identified using the ordered separation pattern of the FAMEs in the GC x FI-MS plot and the exact mass data from the FI-MS mode. Measurement of exact mass also acts as a high-resolution separation technique to separate overlapping peaks. The method is illustrated by application to samples of fish, canola, and biodiesel oils and standard mixtures of 37 FAMEs and of alpha- geometrical isomers. A great wealth of information is achieved in a single run.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29414745>Characteristics and performance of aerobic algae-bacteria granular consortia in a photo-sequencing batch reactor.</a></h2><p>The characteristics and performance of algae-bacteria granular consortia which cultivated with aerobic granules and targeted algae (Chlorella and Scenedesmus), and the essential difference between granular consortia and aerobic granules were investigated in this experiment. The result indicated that algae-bacteria granular consortia could be successfully developed, and the algae present in the granular consortia were mainly Chlorella and Scenedesmus. Although the change of chlorophyll composition revealed the occurrence of light limitation for algal growth, the granular consortia could maintain stable granular structure, and even showed better settling property than aerobic granules. Total nitrogen and phosphate in the algal-bacterial granular system showed better removal efficiencies (50.2% and 35.7%) than those in the aerobic granular system (32.8% and 25.6%) within one cycle (6 h). The biodiesel yield of aerobic granules could be significantly improved by algal coupled process, yet  and methyl palmitoleate were the dominant composition of biodiesel obtained from granular consortia and aerobic granules, respectively. Meanwhile, the difference of dominant bacterial communities in the both granules was found at the order level and family level, and alpha diversity indexes revealed the granular consortia had a higher microbial diversity.Copyright © 2018.

The key advantages of its use are the fact that it is a non-toxic renewable resource, which leads to lower emissions of polluting gases. European governments are targeting the incorporation of 20% of biofuels in the general fuels until 2020. Chemically, biodiesel is a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters, derived from vegetable oils or animal fats, which is usually produced by a transesterification reaction, where the oils/fats react with an alcohol, in the presence of a catalyst. The European Standard (EN 14214) establishes 25 parameters that have to be analysed to certify biodiesel quality and the analytical methods that should be used to determine those properties. This work reports the use of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to determine the esters content in biodiesel as well as the content in linolenic acid methyl esters (C18:3) in industrial and laboratory-scale biodiesel samples. Furthermore, calibration models for myristic (C14:0), palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2) acid methyl esters were also obtained. Principal component analysis was used for the qualitative analysis of the spectra, while partial least squares regression was used to develop the calibration models between analytical and spectral data. The results confirm that NIR spectroscopy, in combination with multivariate calibration, is a promising technique to assess the biodiesel quality control in both laboratory-scale and industrial scale samples.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19692237>Solid phase extraction and enrichment of essential fatty acid methyl esters from soy-derived biodiesel by novel pi-complexing sorbents.</a></h2><p>The essential fatty acid (EFA) methyl esters,  (18:3) and methyl linoleate (18:2), were extracted and enriched from soy-derived biodiesel using novel pi-complexing sorbents. These pi-complexing sorbents were prepared by covalently immobilizing ionic liquids (ILs) onto silica and then coating these silica-supported ILs with silver salts. The silica-supported hydrophobic ILs enhanced the retention of silver salts on the solid sorbents. After the extraction of the polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (PUFAMEs) 18:3 and 18:2 from biodiesel using the sorbents, a decrease in NO(x) emissions and an enhancement of the oxidation stability of biodiesel can be obtained. Solid phase extraction was investigated using a simple three-step procedure consisting of (1) sorbent pre-treatment, (2) sample extraction onto the sorbent and (3) stripping the sorbent by desorption solvent. The factors influencing extraction capacity and selectivity were also studied. 10.5 Mg of sorbent AgBF(4)/SiO(2) x Im(+) x PF(6)(-) could completely adsorb the 18:3 (0.66 mg) from standard biodiesel hexane solution in 5 min. After a consecutive two-step stripping by diethyl ether and 1-hexene, the 18:3 concentration (wt.%) was increased from around 8.5% in the original biodiesel hexane solution to approximately 90% in the 1-hexene stripping solvent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27191950>Benchmark Calculations for Bond Dissociation Enthalpies of Unsaturated Methyl Esters and the Bond Dissociation Enthalpies of .</a></h2><p>It is important to determine an appropriate computational method for obtaining accurate thermochemical properties of large biodiesel molecules such as . In this study, we use Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) and coupled cluster theory to calculate bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) of seven fragment molecules of , in particular, propene, methyl formate, cis-3-hexene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1-pentene, butane, and methyl butanoate. The results are compared to BDEs obtained from experiments and to Oyeyemi et al.'s multireference averaged coupled pair functional (MRACPF2) calculations. We found that with extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit, the BDEs derived from coupled cluster calculations with single, double, and triple excitations (CCSDT) and from CCSDT with a perturbative treatment of connected quadruple excitations, CCSDT(2)Q/CBS, are closer to the available experimental values than those obtained by MRACPF2 for propene and methyl formate. The CCSDT/CBS calculations were chosen as the reference for validating the DFT methods. Among the density functionals, we found that M08-HX has the best performance with a mean unsigned deviation (MUD) from CCSDT/CBS of only 1.0 kcal/mol, whereas the much more expensive MRACPF2 has an MUD of 1.1 kcal/mol. We then used the most successfully validated density functionals to calculate the BDEs of  and compared the results with the MRACPF2 BDEs. The present study identifies several Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation functionals that should be useful for modeling ester combustion, especially the M08-HX, M06-2X, M05-2X, M08-SO, and MPWB1K global-hybrid meta functionals, the M11 and MN12-SX range-separated-hybrid meta functionals, the ωB97 range-separated hybrid gradient approximation functional, and the SOGGA11-X global-hybrid gradient approximation functional.</p></html>
