Epidemiological studies show that chronic treatment with low levels of cyclooxygenase inhibitors (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) lowers the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) by as much as 50%. Unfortunately, inhibiting cyclooxygenases with NSAIDs blocks the synthesis of downstream neuroprotective and neurotoxic PGs, thus producing adverse side effects. We focus on prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) because it is highly neurotoxic compared to , D2, and E2. Unlike other PGs, PGJ2 and its metabolites have a cyclopentenone ring with reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups that form covalent Michael adducts with key cysteines in proteins and GSH. Cysteine-binding electrophiles such as PGJ2 are considered to play an important role in determining whether neurons will live or die. We discuss in vitro and in vivo studies showing that PGJ2 induces pathological processes relevant to neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and PD. Further, we discuss our work showing that increasing intracellular cAMP with the lipophilic peptide PACAP27 counteracts some of the PGJ2-induced detrimental effects. New therapeutic strategies that neutralize the effects of specific neurotoxic PGs downstream from cyclooxygenases could have a significant impact on the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative disorders with fewer adverse side effects.© 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623164>Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy and Its Emerging Role in Hematological Malignancies.</a></h2><p>Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) ensures the selective degradation of cellular proteins endowed with a KFERQ-like motif by lysosomes. It is estimated that 30% of all cellular proteins can be directed to the lysosome for CMA degradation, but only a few substrates have been formally identified so far. Mechanistically, the KFERQ-like motifs present in substrate proteins are recognized by the molecular chaperone Hsc70c (Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein cytosolic), also known as HSPA8, and directed to LAMP2A, which acts as the CMA receptor at the lysosomal surface. Following linearization, the protein substrate is next transported to the lumen of the lysosomes, where it is degraded by resident proteases, mainly cathepsins and eventually recycled to sustain cellular homeostasis. CMA is induced by different stress conditions, including  deprivation that also activates macro-autophagy (MA), that may make it difficult to decipher the relative impact of both pathways on cellular homeostasis. Besides common inducing triggers, CMA and MA might be induced as compensatory mechanisms when either mechanism is altered, as it is the often the case in different pathological settings. Therefore, CMA activation can compensate for alterations of MA and vice versa. In this context, these compensatory mechanisms, when occurring, may be targeted for therapeutic purposes. Both processes have received particular attention from scientists and clinicians, since modulation of MA and CMA may have a profound impact on cellular proteostasis, metabolism, death, differentiation, and survival and, as such, could be targeted for therapeutic intervention in degenerative and immune diseases, as well as in cancer, including hematopoietic malignancies. The role of MA in cancer initiation and progression is now well established, but whether and how CMA is involved in tumorigenesis has been only sparsely explored. In the present review, we encompass the description of the mechanisms involved in CMA, its function in the physiology and pathogenesis of hematopoietic cells, its emerging role in cancer initiation and development, and, finally, the potential therapeutic opportunity to target CMA or CMA-mediated compensatory mechanisms in hematological malignancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27307258>Two Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenases Catalyze Early Hydroxylation Steps in the Potato Steroid Glycoalkaloid Biosynthetic Pathway.</a></h2><p>α-Solanine and α-chaconine, steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) found in potato (Solanum tuberosum), are among the best-known secondary metabolites in food crops. At low concentrations in potato tubers, SGAs are distasteful; however, at high concentrations, SGAs are harmful to humans and animals. Here, we show that POTATO GLYCOALKALOID BIOSYNTHESIS1 () and PGA2, two genes that encode cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP72A208 and CYP72A188), are involved in the SGA biosynthetic pathway, respectively. The knockdown plants of either  or PGA2 contained very little SGA, yet vegetative growth and tuber production were not affected. Analyzing metabolites that accumulated in the plants and produced by in vitro enzyme assays revealed that  and PGA2 catalyzed the 26- and 22-hydroxylation steps, respectively, in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. The PGA-knockdown plants had two unique phenotypic characteristics: The plants were sterile and tubers of these knockdown plants did not sprout during storage. Functional analyses of  and PGA2 have provided clues for controlling both potato glycoalkaloid biosynthesis and tuber sprouting, two traits that can significantly impact potato breeding and the industry.© 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Microalgae are promising and potential alternate  resources for biodiesel production. Thus, our efforts were focused on surveying the natural diversity of microalgae for the production of biodiesel. The present study aimed at identification, isolation, and characterization of oleaginous microalgae from shola forests of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR), the biodiversity hot spot of India, where the microalgal diversity has not yet been systematically investigated.Overall the higher biomass yield, higher lipid accumulation and thermotolerance observed in the isolated microalgal strains have been found to be the desirable traits for the efficient biodiesel production. Species composition and diversity analysis yielded ten potential microalgal isolates belonging to Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae classes. The chlorophytes exhibited higher growth rate, maximum biomass yield, and higher lipid accumulation than Cyanophyceae. Among the chlorophytes, the best performing strains were identified and represented by Acutodesmus dissociatus (TGA1), Chlorella sp. (TGA2), Chlamydomonadales sp. (TGA3) and Hindakia tetrachotoma (). The Chlamydomonadales sp. recorded with the highest growth rate, lipid accumulation and biomass yield of 0.28 ± 0.03 day (μ), 29.7 ± 0.69% and 134.17 ± 16.87 mg L day, respectively. It was also found to grow well at various temperatures, viz., 25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C, indicating its suitability for open pond cultivation. The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis of stationary phase cultures of selected four algal strains by tandem mass spectrograph showed C16:0, C18:1 and C18:3 as dominant fatty acids suitable for biodiesel production. All the three strains except for Hindakia tetrachotoma () recorded higher carbohydrate content and were considered as potential feed stocks for biodiesel production through hydrothermal liquefaction technology (HTL).In conclusion, the present investigation is a first systematic study on the microalgal diversity of soil and water samples from selected sites of NBR. The study resulted in isolation and characterization of ten potent oleaginous microalgae and found four cultures as promising feed stocks for biodiesel production. Of the four microalgae, Chlamydomonadales sp. (TGA3) was found to be significantly thermo-tolerant and can be considered as promising feedstock for biodiesel production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27716202>Proteomic analysis of the signaling pathway mediated by the heterotrimeric Gα protein  of Penicillium chrysogenum.</a></h2><p>The heterotrimeric Gα protein -mediated signaling pathway regulates the entire developmental program in Penicillium chrysogenum, from spore germination to the formation of conidia. In addition it participates in the regulation of penicillin biosynthesis. We aimed to advance the understanding of this key signaling pathway using a proteomics approach, a powerful tool to identify effectors participating in signal transduction pathways.Penicillium chrysogenum mutants with different levels of activity of the -mediated signaling pathway were used to perform comparative proteomic analyses by 2D-DIGE and LC-MS/MS. Thirty proteins were identified which showed differences in abundance dependent on  activity level. By modifying the intracellular levels of cAMP we could establish cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent pathways in -mediated signaling.  was shown to regulate abundance of enzymes in primary metabolic pathways involved in ATP, NADPH and cysteine biosynthesis, compounds that are needed for high levels of penicillin production. An in vivo phosphorylated protein containing a pleckstrin homology domain was identified; this protein is a candidate for signal transduction activity. Proteins with possible roles in purine metabolism, protein folding, stress response and morphogenesis were also identified whose abundance was regulated by  signaling.Thirty proteins whose abundance was regulated by the -mediated signaling pathway were identified. These proteins are involved in primary metabolism, stress response, development and signal transduction. A model describing the pathways through which  signaling regulates different cellular processes is proposed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25666760>A new role for  in inhibiting hepatitis C virus-IRES-mediated translation by targeting viral translation factors.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPGs) inhibit the replication of a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses in different mammalian cell types. We investigated a new role for  () in the inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-IRES-mediated translation.  exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory effects on HCV translation in HCV replicon cells. Furthermore, repetitive  treatment demonstrated the potential to safely induce the suppression of HCV translation.

In pull-down assays, biotinylated  co-precipitated with the entire HCV IRES RNA/eIF3-40S subunit complex. Moreover, the interactions between  and the elongation factors and ribosomal subunit were dependent upon HCV IRES RNA binding, and the /HCV IRES RNA/eIF3-40S subunit complex inhibited HCV-IRES-mediated translation. The novel mechanism revealed in this study may aid in the search for more effective anti-HCV drugs.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, to date, development of clinically useful inhibitors has been largely unsuccessful. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPGs) are reactive lipid mediators that bind covalently to proteins and exert anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects in numerous settings. By pursuing targets for modification by cyPGs we have found that the cyPG  binds to and inactivates AKR1B1. A -AKR1B1 adduct was observed, both by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and by SDS-PAGE using biotinylated  (-B). Insight into the molecular interactions between AKR1B1 and  was advanced by molecular modeling. This anticipated the addition of  to active site Cys298 and the potential reversibility of the adduct, which was supported experimentally. Indeed, loss of biotin label from the AKR1B1--B adduct was favored by glutathione, indicating a retro-Michael reaction, which unveils new implications of cyPG-protein interaction.  elicited only marginal inhibition of aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1), considered responsible for the severe adverse effects of many AKR1B1 inhibitors. Interestingly, other prostaglandins (PGs) inhibited the enzyme, including non-electrophilic PGE1 and PGE2, currently used in clinical practice. Moreover, both  and PGE1 reduced the formation of sorbitol in an ex-vivo model of diabetic cataract to an extent comparable to that attained by the known AKR inhibitor epalrestat. Taken together, these results highlight the role of PGs as AKR1B1 inhibitors and the interest in PG-related molecules as leads for the development of novel pharmacological tools.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268055>Effective and safe in vivo gene delivery based on polyglutamic acid complexes with heterocyclic amine modified-polyethylenimine.</a></h2><p>Polyethylenimine (PEI) has been extensively used for non-viral gene delivery. Increasing the molecular weight of PEI often improves transfection efficiency, but enhances cytotoxicity and non-specific interaction with plasma proteins, limiting its use in clinical applications. In this study, poly-l-glutamic acid (L-PGA) as an anionic polymer, was introduced to piperazine-modified PEI to improve its in vivo properties. The physicochemical properties, cytotoxicity, in vitro and in vivo tranfection efficiency of these carriers were evaluated. Conjugation of 50% of primary amines of PEI 25 kDa with piperazine in the presence of PGA (PEIPip/PGA) could significantly increase transfection efficiency even in the presence of serum compared to PEI 25 kDa. Increasing the PGA content led to lower cytotoxicity of DNA/PEIPip/PGA triplexes. Systemic administration of triplexes in Balb/c mice resulted in significant enhancement of luciferase gene expression in brain, spleen, and liver compared to PEI 25 kDa. In a 30-day survival study, no significant changes were observed in mice body weights in DNA/PEIPip/PGA group. Moreover, this group exhibited a survival rate of 100% compared to 0% in mice receiving PEI 25 kDa. This novel PEIPip/PGA carrier could be used to overcome the serum inhibitory effects on gene expression in vivo, providing a promising gene delivery system for tissue-specific targeting.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These receptors and their agonists might be involved in development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We investigated whether polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites, which activate TRPs, are present in colon tissues from patients with IBS and act as endogenous agonists to induce hypersensitivity.We analyzed colon biopsy samples from 40 patients with IBS (IBS biopsies) and 11 healthy individuals undergoing colorectal cancer screening (controls), collected during colonoscopy at the University of Bologna, Italy. Levels of the PUFA metabolites that activate TRPV1 (12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and leukotriene B4), TRPV4 (5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid [EET] and 8,9-EET), and TRPA1 (, 8-iso-prostaglandin A2, and 15-deoxy-Δ-prostaglandin J2) were measured in biopsies and their supernatants using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry; we also measured levels of the PUFA metabolites prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and resolvins. C57Bl6 mice were given intrathecal injections of small interfering RNAs to reduce levels of TRPV4, or control small interfering RNAs, along with colonic injections of biopsy supernatants; visceral hypersensitivity was measured based on response to colorectal distension. Mouse sensory neurons were cultured and incubated with biopsy supernatants and lipids extracted from biopsies or colons of mice. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect TRPV4 in human dorsal root ganglia samples (from the National Disease Research Interchange).Levels of the TRPV4 agonist 5,6-EET, but not levels of TRPV1 or TRPA1 agonists, were increased in IBS biopsies compared with controls; increases correlated with pain and bloating scores. Supernatants from IBS biopsies, but not from controls, induced visceral hypersensitivity in mice. Small interfering RNA knockdown of TRPV4 in mouse primary afferent neurons inhibited the hypersensitivity caused by supernatants from IBS biopsies. Levels of 5,6-EET and 15-HETE were increased in colons of mice with, but not without, visceral hypersensitivity. PUFA metabolites extracted from IBS biopsies or colons of mice with visceral hypersensitivity activated mouse sensory neurons in vitro, by activating TRPV4. Mouse sensory neurons exposed to supernatants from IBS biopsies produced 5,6-EET via a mechanism that involved the proteinase-activated receptor-2 and cytochrome epoxygenase. In human dorsal root ganglia, TPV4 was expressed by 35% of neurons.Colon tissues from patients with IBS have increased levels of specific PUFA metabolites. These stimulate sensory neurons from mice and generate visceral hypersensitivity via activation of TRPV4.Copyright © 2015 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the pathways leading to the activation of defense reactions related to abiotic or biotic stress as a function of RES formation, accumulation or treatment are poorly understood in plants. Here, the thiol-modification of proteins, including the RES-activated basic region/leucine zipper transcription factor TGA2, was studied. TGA2 contains a single cysteine residue (Cys186) that was covalently modified by reactive cyclopentenones but not required for induction of detoxification genes in response to OPDA or . Activation of the glutathione-S-transferase 6 (GST6) promoter was responsive to cyclopentenones but not to unreactive cyclopentanones, including jasmonic acid suggesting that thiol reactivity of RES is important to activate the TGA2-dependent signaling pathway resulting in GST6 activation We show that RES modify thiols in numerous proteins in vivo, however, thiol reactivity alone appears not to be sufficient for biological activity as demonstrated by the failure of several membrane permeable thiol reactive reagents to activate the GST6 promoter.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30627958> Inhibits the Cognitive Decline of APP/PS1 Transgenic Mice via PPARγ/ABCA1-dependent Cholesterol Efflux Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandins (PGs) are early and key contributors to chronic neurodegenerative diseases. As one important member of classical PGs,  has been reported to exert potential neuroprotective effects. However, the mechanisms remain unknown. To this end, we are prompted to investigate whether  is a useful neurological treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) or not. Using high-throughput sequencing, we found that  potentially regulates cholesterol metabolism and lipid transport. Interestingly, we further found that short-term administration of  decreased the levels of the monomeric and oligomeric β-amyloid protein (oAβ) in a cholesterol-dependent manner. In detail,  activated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) signalling pathways, promoting the efflux of cholesterol and decreasing the intracellular cholesterol levels. Through PPARγ/ABCA1/cholesterol-dependent pathway,  decreased the expression of presenilin enhancer protein 2 (PEN-2), which is responsible for the production of Aβ.

However, the mechanism that initiates this cytotoxic response remains elusive. Here we report that  triggers apoptosis by a process that entails the specific activation of H- and N-Ras isoforms, leading to caspase activation. Cells without H- and N-Ras did not undergo apoptosis upon  treatment; in these cells, the cellular demise was rescued by overexpression of either H-Ras or N-Ras. Consistently, the mutant H-Ras-C118S, defective for binding , did not produce cell death. Molecular analysis revealed a key role for the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway in the apoptotic process through the induction of calpain activity and caspase-12 cleavage. We propose that  evokes a specific physiological cell death program, through H- and N-Ras, but not K-Ras, activation at endomembranes.

In recent years, the emergence of new avian strains able to infect humans represents a serious threat to global human health. The increase in drug-resistant IAV strains underscores the need for novel approaches to anti-influenza chemotherapy. Herein we show that  () possesses antiviral activity against avian IAV, including H5N9, H7N1 and H1N1 strains, acting at a level different from the currently available anti-influenza drugs.  acts at postentry level, causing dysregulation of viral protein synthesis and preventing virus-induced disassembly of host microtubular network and activation of pro-inflammatory factor NF-κB. The antiviral activity is dependent on the presence of a cyclopentenone ring structure and is associated with activation of a cytoprotective heat shock response in infected cells. The results suggest that cyclopentenone prostanoids or prostanoids-derived molecules may represent a new tool to combat avian influenza virus infection.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We reported that PGs influence protein expression in insect cell lines, which prompted the question: do PGs influence cell proliferation or viability in insect cell lines? Here, we report on the outcomes of experiments designed to address the question in cell lines from three insect orders: Hemiptera (squash bug, Anasa tristis, BCIRL-AtE-CLG15A), Coleoptera (red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, BCIRL-TcA-CLG1), and Lepidoptera (tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens, BCIRL-HvAM1). Treating the insect cell lines with PGA, PGA, or PGD led to dose-dependent reductions in cell numbers. All three cell lines were sensitive to PGA and PGA (ICs = 9.9 to 26.9 μM) and were less sensitive to PGD (ICs = 31.6 to 104.7 μM). PG treatments also led to cell death at higher concentrations, as seen in mammalian cell lines. PGE, PGE, and PGF treatments did not influence AtE-CLG15A or HvAM1 cell numbers at lower concentrations, but led to dose-related reductions in TcA-CLG1 cells at higher concentrations. Similar treatments with pharmaceutical inhibitors of PG biosynthesis also led to reduced cell numbers: MAFP (inhibits phospholipase A), indomethacin (inhibits PG biosynthesis), and esculetin (inhibits lipoxygenase). Because these pharmaceuticals are used to relieve  and other medical issues in human medicine, they are not toxic to animal cells. We infer PGs are necessary in optimal quantities for ongoing homeostatic functions in established cell lines; in quantities outside the optimal concentrations, PGs are deleterious.</p></html>
