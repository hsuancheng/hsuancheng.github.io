The comparative efficacy of various bariatric procedures for the remission of type   has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to compare the effects of the two most common bariatric procedures, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, on remission of  and β-cell function.We conducted a single-centre, triple-blind, randomised trial at Vestfold Hospital Trust (Tønsberg, Norway), in which patients (aged ≥18 years) with type   and obesity were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy (the Oseberg study). Randomisation was performed with a computerised random number generator and a block size of 10. Treatment allocation was masked from participants, study personnel, and outcome assessors and was concealed with sealed opaque envelopes. Surgeons used identical skin incisions during both surgeries and were not involved in patient follow-up. The primary clinical outcome was the proportion of participants with complete remission of type   (HbA of ≤6·0% [42 mmol/mol] without the use of glucose-lowering medication) at 1 year after surgery. The primary physiological outcome was disposition index (a measure of β-cell function) at 1 year after surgery, as assessed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Primary outcomes were analysed in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. This trial is ongoing and closed to recruitment, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, .Between Oct 15, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017, 1305 patients who were preparing for bariatric surgery were screened, of whom 319 consecutive patients with type   were assessed for eligibility. 109 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to gastric bypass (n=54) or sleeve gastrectomy (n=55). 107 (98%) of 109 patients completed 1-year follow-up, with one patient in each group withdrawing after surgery (per-protocol population). In the intention-to-treat population,  remission rates were higher in the gastric bypass group than in the sleeve gastrectomy group (risk difference 27% [95% CI 10 to 44]; relative risk [RR] 1·57 [1·14 to ·16], p=0·0054); results were similar in the per-protocol population (risk difference 27% [95% CI 10 to 45]; RR 1·57 [1·14 to ·15], p=0·0036). In the intention-to-treat population, disposition index increased in both groups (between-group difference 55 [-111 to 220], p=0·52); results were similar in the per-protocol population (between-group difference 21 [-214 to 256], p=0.86). In the gastric bypass group, ten of 54 participants had early complications and 17 of 53 had late side-effects. In the sleeve gastrectomy group, eight of 55 participants had early complications and 22 of 54 had late side-effects. No deaths occurred in either group.Gastric bypass was found to be superior to sleeve gastrectomy for remission of type   at 1 year after surgery, and the two procedures had a similar beneficial effect on β-cell function. The use of gastric bypass as the preferred bariatric procedure for patients with obesity and type   could improve  care and reduce related societal costs.Morbid Obesity Centre, Vestfold Hospital Trust.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The loss or dysfunction of insulin-producing β-cells, in patients with type 1 and type   respectively, put these cells at the center of the disease initiation and progression. Therefore, major efforts have been taken to restore the β-cell mass by cell-replacement or regeneration approaches. Implementing novel therapies requires deciphering the developmental mechanisms that generate β-cells and determine the acquisition of their physiological phenotype. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate the postnatal maturation of β-cells and define their functional identity. Furthermore, we discuss different routes by which β-cells lose their features and functionality in type 1 and  diabetic conditions. We then focus on potential mechanisms to restore the functionality of those β-cell populations that have lost their functional phenotype. Finally, we discuss the recent progress and remaining challenges facing the generation of functional mature β-cells from stem cells for cell-replacement therapy for  treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669219>Benzimidazole-based dual dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Multiple-targeting compounds might reduce complex polypharmacy of multifactorial diseases, such as , and contribute to the greater therapeutic success. Targeting reactive oxygen species-producing enzymes, as xanthine oxidase (XO), might suppress progression of -associated vascular complications. In this study a small series of benzimidazole derivatives (1-9) was evaluated for inhibitory activity against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and XO. One 1,3-disubstituted-benzimidazole--imine (5) and 1,3-thiazolo[3,-a]benzimidazolone derivative (8) were shown as effective dual DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, with IC values lower than 200 μM, and predicted binding modes with both target enzymes. Both selected dual inhibitors (compounds 5 and 8) did not show cytotoxicity to a greater extent on Caco- cells even at concentration of 250 μM. These structures represent new non-purine scaffolds bearing two therapeutic functionalities, being DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, more favorable in comparison to DPP-4 inhibitors with DPP-4 as a single target due to pleiotropic effects of XO inhibition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Patients who received contrast were compared with unexposed controls before and after propensity score (PS) matching derived from baseline characteristics, admission diagnoses, comorbidities and severity of illness. AKI, defined as initial onset (stage 1) or increased severity, was determined from serum creatinine according to KDIGO guidelines.Based on ,306 PS-matched pairs obtained from ,557 cases that received intravenous contrast and 4,776 unexposed controls, the increase in AKI attributable to contrast was 1.3% (19.3 vs. 18.0%, p=0.273) and no association was found between contrast and the pattern of onset and recovery. Hospital mortality increased by 14.3% subsequent to AKI (18.0 vs. 3.6, p<0.001) but the risk ratio in relation to patients with stable AKI did not vary when stratified by contrast. Multivariable regression identified sepsis, metabolic disorders, , history of renal disease, and severity of illness as factors more strongly associated with AKI.In critically ill adults with normal kidney function, low osmolar radiocontrast media did not substantively increase AKI. Rather than limiting the use of contrast in ICU patients, efforts to prevent AKI should focus on the susceptibility of patients with sepsis,  complications, high APACHE score, or a history of renal disease.Copyright © 2019 American College of Chest Physicians.

Previous studies have found that high-glucose environments can aggravate BP-induced DNA damage in nerve cells. Ku70 is subunit of the DNA damage repair enzyme DNA-PK. This study was designed to determine whether high-glucose conditions enhance BP neurotoxicity and DNA damage by inhibiting Ku70 expression.We examined the effect of BP on apoptosis and DNA damage in murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons under hyperglycaemic conditions. Untreated DRG cells and DRG cells pretreated with NU7441, a DNA-PK inhibitor, were cultured for 3 days under normal culture conditions or with 50 mM glucose, and the cells were then treated with BP for 3 h. DNA damage was investigated via comet assays, the ratio of early to late apoptotic cells was assessed by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, and cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assays. The protein expression levels of DNA-PK, Ku70, Bax, Bcl- and γH2ax were measured by immunofluorescence or Western blotting.Compared to its effect under normal culture conditions, BP treatment led to decreased cell viability and increased DNA damage in DRG cells grown under high-glucose conditions. The rate of DRG cell apoptosis and the expression of γH2ax, the ratio of Bax to Bcl- also increased under the high-glucose conditions. Furthermore, Ku70 expression was inhibited. The DNA-PK inhibitor, NU7441, could significantly inhibit DNA-PK and Ku70 expression, simultaneously further aggravating BP-induced apoptosis and DNA damage under high-glucose conditions.These data indicate that hyperglycaemia may enhance BP-induced neurotoxicity and DNA damage by inhibiting the DNA repair protein Ku70.Copyright © 2019.

Accumulating data suggest excessive oxidative stress contributes to an exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in cardiovascular-related diseases. Excessive oxidative stress is also a primary underlying mechanism for the development and progression of T2DM. However, whether oxidative stress plays a role in mediating the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in T2DM is not known. Therefore, this review explores the potential role of oxidative stress leading to increased activation of the afferent arm of the exercise pressor reflex. Several lines of evidence support direct and indirect effects of oxidative stress on the exercise pressor reflex. For example, intramuscular ROS may directly and indirectly (by attenuating contracting muscle blood flow) increase group III and IV afferent activity. Oxidative stress is a primary underlying mechanism for the development of neuropathic pain, which in turn is associated with increased group III and IV afferent activity. These are the same type of afferents that evoke muscle pain and the exercise pressor reflex. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced release of inflammatory mediators may modulate afferent activity. Collectively, these alterations may result in a positive feedback loop that further amplifies the exercise pressor reflex. An exaggerated reflex increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Thus, identifying the contribution of oxidative stress could provide a potential therapeutic target to reduce this risk in T2DM.Copyright © 2019.

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signaling may reverse this effect. However, whether angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation improve oxidative damage and albuminuria through different mechanisms is not known. Using insulin resistant Otsuka Long Evan Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneous blockade of AT1 and activation of GLP-1r additively decrease oxidative damage and urinary albumin excretion (U V) in the following groups: (1) untreated, lean LETO (n=7), () untreated, obese OLETF (n=9), (3) OLETF + angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; 10 mg olmesartan /kg/d; n=9), (4) OLETF + GLP-1 mimetic (EXE; 10 ug exenatide/kg/d; n=7), and (5) OLETF + ARB + exenatide (Combo; n=6). Mean kidney Nox4 protein expression and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were 30% and 46% greater, respectively, in OLETF compared to LETO. Conversely, Nox4 protein expression and NT were reduced to LETO levels in ARB and EXE, and Combo reduced Nox4, NT, and 4-hydroxy--nonenal levels by 21%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. At baseline, U V was nearly double in OLETF compared to LETO, and increased to nearly 10-fold greater levels by the end of the study. While ARB (45%) and EXE (55%) individually reduced U V, the combination completely ameliorated the albuminuria. Collectively, these data suggest that AT1 blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation reduce renal oxidative damage similarly during insulin resistance, while targeting both signaling pathways provides added benefit in restoring and/or further ameliorating albuminuria in a model of diet-induced obesity.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675427>Effect of Metabolic Traits on the Risk of Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Cancer in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common liver condition. Predicting its progression could help clinicians manage and potentially prevent complications. We evaluated the independent and joint effects of metabolic traits on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with NAFLD. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008 with follow-up through 12/31/2015. We performed competing risk, adjusted cause-specific Cox models to evaluate the effects of metabolic traits (, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity) as additive or combined indicators on time to develop cirrhosis or HCC or a composite endpoint of both. Of the 271,906 patients, 22,794 developed cirrhosis, and 253 developed HCC during a mean of 9 years follow up. At baseline, the mean BMI was 31.6 (SD, 5.6), 28.7% had , 70.3% hypertension, and 62.3% had dyslipidemia with substantial overlap among the these traits. The risk of progression was the lowest in patients with only one or no metabolic trait. There was a stepwise increase in risk with each additional metabolic trait. Compared to patients with no metabolic trait, patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia had 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis/HCC (hazard ratio (HR) =1.8, 95% CI=1.59-.06); the risk was .6-fold higher in patients with , obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension (HR=.6, 95% CI=.3,.9).

Metabolic challenges such as the one posed by high fructose intake are important determinants of disease mechanisms. We embarked on studies to determine how fructose affects differential metabolic dysfunctions across genetically dissimilar mice, namely, C57BL/6 J (B6), DBA/ J (DBA) and FVB/NJ (FVB), by integrating physiological and gene regulatory mechanisms. We report that fructose has strain-specific effects, involving tissue-specific gene regulatory cascades in hypothalamus, liver, and white adipose tissues. DBA mice showed the largest numbers of genes associated with adiposity, congruent with their highest susceptibility to adiposity gain and glucose intolerance across the three tissues. In contrast, B6 and FVB mainly exhibited cholesterol phenotypes, accompanying the largest number of adipose genes correlating with total cholesterol in B6, and liver genes correlating with LDL in FVB mice. Tissue-specific network modeling predicted strain-and tissue-specific regulators such as Fgf21 (DBA) and Lss (B6), which were subsequently validated in primary hepatocytes. Strain-specific fructose-responsive genes revealed susceptibility for human diseases such that genes in liver and adipose tissue in DBA showed strong enrichment for human type   and obesity traits. Liver and adipose tissues genes in FVB were mostly related to lipid traits, and liver and adipose genes in B6 showed relevance to most cardiometabolic traits tested. Our results show that fructose induces gene regulatory pathways that are tissue specific and dependent on the genetic make-up, which may underlie interindividual variability in cardiometabolic responses to high fructose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

The 3 ×  two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was used to examine the main effects of speeds and durations and their interaction.The walking speed significantly affected skin blood flow responses (p < 0.01). Walking at 9 km/h significantly increased plantar skin blood flow (5.71 ± 1.89) compared to walking at 6 km/h (.1 ± 0.29) and 3 km/h (1.16 ± 0.14), especially at 20-minute walking duration (p < 0.01). The walking duration showed a trend of significance on affecting skin blood flow responses (p = 0.06). There was no significant interaction between walking speeds and durations (p > 0.05).Our results provide the first evidence that walking speeds affect plantar skin blood flow and a fast walking speed (9 km/h) significantly increases plantar skin blood flow compared to moderate (6 km/h) and slow (3 km/h) walking speeds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Despite greater intramuscular lipids, athletes are highly insulin sensitive, which could result from higher rates of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis or glucose transport/phosphorylation and oxidation. Thus, we examined the time course of muscle glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations during low and high systemic lipid availability.METHODSEight endurance-trained and 9 sedentary humans (VO2 peak: 56 ±  vs. 33 ±  mL/kg/min, P < 0.05) underwent 6-hour hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp tests with infusions of triglycerides or saline in a randomized crossover design. Glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations were monitored in vastus lateralis muscles using 13C/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.RESULTSAthletes displayed a 25% greater (P < 0.05) insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate (Rd) than sedentary participants. During Intralipid infusion, insulin sensitivity remained higher in the athletes (ΔRd: 25 ± 3 vs. 17 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05), supported by higher glucose transporter type 4 protein expression than in sedentary humans. Compared to saline infusion, AUC of glucose-6-phosphate remained unchanged during Intralipid infusion in athletes (1.6 ± 0. mmol/L vs. 1.4 ± 0. [mmol/L] × h, P = n.s.) but tended to decrease by 36% in sedentary humans (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1 [mmol/L] × h, P < 0.059). This drop was accompanied by a 72% higher rate of net glycogen synthesis in the athletes upon Intralipid infusion (47 ± 9 vs. 13 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONAthletes feature higher skeletal muscle glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis during increased lipid availability, which primarily results from maintained insulin-stimulated glucose transport with increased myocellular glucose-6-phosphate levels for subsequent glycogen synthesis.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov .FUNDINGGerman Federal Ministry of Health (BMG).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680269></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678061>Bariatric surgery and type  : a step closer to defining an optimal approach.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669187>A Longitudinal Study on the Association Between Diabetic Foot Disease and Health-Related Quality of Life in Adults With Type  .</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to assess the association between diabetic foot disease and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during a -year follow up among people with type   in Alberta.A type   cohort was established (2011‒2013); those with self-reported diabetic foot disease were identified.

Data were collected between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2000. One thousand nine hundred eighty-one individuals were classified based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) into group I (>90 mL/min/1.73 m), group II (60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m) and group III (<60 mL/min/1.73 m; chronic kidney disease [CKD]). Age/sex-adjusted baseline characteristics, tertiles of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and their interactions with eGFR were examined. Outcomes measured included incident myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure, stroke, and all-cause mortality.Eight hundred nineteen patients were classified as group I, 1036 as group II, and 126 of 1981 (6.4%) as group III or CKD. Subjects in group III were older and had a higher incidence of hypertension, , and MI at baseline. Over a 10.-year follow-up period, CKD was associated with an increased risk of MI (hazard ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.-3.14; P=.006) and composite cardiovascular outcomes including MI, congestive heart failure, stroke, and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.05-1.83 ;P=.02). Subjects with NT-proBNP or hs-TnT in the third tertile were at greater risk of cardiovascular events without significant interactions between eGFR and levels of NT-proBNP and hs-TnT.Subjects with CKD had significantly elevated cardiac biomarkers and were at an increased risk of MI and adverse cardiovascular events. This warrants future studies to investigate whether these cardiac biomarkers could identify high-risk CKD patients for aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors.Copyright © 2019 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Microvascular endothelial dysfunction can predict future cardiovascular adverse events, but the predictive value of microvascular endothelial dysfunction for future risk of solid-tumor cancer has not been characterized.A total of 488 patients who underwent microvascular endothelial function assessment using reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry were included in this study. Microvascular endothelial dysfunction was defined as a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index ≤.0.Of 221 patients with a baseline reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index ≤.0, 21 patients (9.5%) were diagnosed with incident solid-tumor cancer during follow-up, whereas of 267 patients with a baseline reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index >.0, 10 patients (3.7%) were diagnosed with incident solid-tumor cancer during follow-up ( = 0.009). Patients with a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index ≤.0 had lower solid-tumor cancer-free survival compared to patients with a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index >.0 (log-rank  = 0.017) (median follow-up 6.0 (3.0-9.1) years). Cox proportional hazard analyses showed that a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index ≤.0 predicted the incidence of solid-tumor cancer, with a hazard ratio of .52 (95% confidence interval 1.17-5.45;  = 0.019) after adjusting for age, sex, and coronary artery disease, .83 (95% confidence interval 1.30-6.17;  = 0.009) after adjusting for , hypertension, smoking status, and body mass index >30 kg/m, .79 (95% confidence interval 1.21-6.41;  = 0.016) after adjusting for fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, smoking status (current or former), and body mass index, and .43 (95% confidence interval 1.10-5.34;  = 0.028) after adjusting for Framingham risk score.Microvascular endothelial dysfunction, as defined by a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index ≤.0, was associated with a greater than two-fold increased risk of solid-tumor cancer.

Certain cellular pathways modification and also some transcription factors activation may protect cells from hyperglycemia condition induced damages. This study purpose was to determine the vitamin D supplementation effect on some key factors [advanced glycation end products (AGEs) signaling pathway] that were involved in the diabetic complications occurrence and progression for type-  participants.48 type- diabetic patients (T2DM) randomly divided into two groups (n = 24 per group), receiving: 100-µg vitamin D or placebo for 3 months. At this study beginning and the end, the receptor expression for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and glyoxalase I (GLO1) enzyme from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and AGEs and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) serum levels were measured by the use of real-time PCR and ELISA methods, respectively.This study results demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation could down-regulate RAGE mRNA [fold change = 0.72 in vitamin D vs. 0.95 in placebo) P = 0.001)]. In addition, no significant changes were observed for GLO1 enzyme expression (P = 0.06). This study results also indicated that vitamin D serum level significantly increased in vitamin D group (P < 0.001). Moreover, AGES and TNF-α serum levels significantly reduced in vitamin D group, but they were remained unchanged in the placebo group.In conclusion, vascular complications are more frequent in diabetic patients, and vitamin D treatment may prevent or delay the complications onset in these patients by AGEs serum level and RAGE gene expression reducing. .

The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of MetS and its associated risk factors among adult Palestinians using the International  Federation definition.A total of 1348 subjects ages 18-65 y were recruited in a cross-sectional study that was conducted in 2018-2019 in the northern West Bank.A total of 1082 subjects participated; 51.7% were men. The prevalence of MetS was high (44.9%), and higher among women (46.1%) than men (44.%) (p<0.001). The prevalence increased significantly with increasing age and body mass index (BMI) in both genders (p<0.001). However, metabolically obese but normal weight individuals (MONW) (8.4%) were also identified, with a slight increase among women (9.4%) compared with men (7.5%) (p=0.56). MetS was more likely to be prevalent among participants with increased fasting blood sugar (5.8 times), increased triglyceride (7.4 times), increased blood pressure (4.5 times) and BMI ≥25 (19.9 times) (p<0.001). The prevalence of MetS was higher among rural (50.3%) vs urban (39.3%) residents and refugees (33.8%).With increasing age and obesity, clustering of MetS components increased remarkably in both genders. Effective prevention and treatment strategies for MetS and its risk factors should be developed targeting different ages and genders.© The Author(s) 2019.

The goal of this case-control study was to identify circulating miRNAs for the diagnosis of DR. The miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit was used to extract serum miRNAs. The μParaflo™ MicroRNA microarray was used to detect the expression levels of the miRNAs. The miRWalk algorithm was applied to predict the target genes of the miRNAs, which were further confirmed by the dual luciferase reporter gene system in HEK293T cells. A microarray was performed between 5 DR cases and 5 age-, sex-, body mass index-, and duration of -matched type  diabetic (T2DM) controls. The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique was used to validate the differentially expressed circulating miRNAs in 45 DR cases and 45 well-matched controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the circulating miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for DR. Our microarray analysis screened out miR-2116-5p and miR-3197 as significantly up-regulated in DR cases compared with the controls. Furthermore, two miRNAs were validated in the 45 DR cases and 45 controls. The ROC analysis suggested that both miR-3197 and miR-2116-5p distinguished DR cases from controls. An additional dual-luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that notch homolog  (NOTCH2) was the target gene of miR-2116-5p. Both miR-3197 and miR-2116-5p were identified as promising diagnostic biomarkers for DR.

Although diabetic polyneuropathy is the most important risk factor in cases of diabetic foot, given its poor prognosis, the criteria for diagnosis and staging of diabetic polyneuropathy has not been established; consequently, no disease-modifying treatment is available. Most criteria and scoring systems which were previously proposed consist of clinical signs, symptoms, and quantitative examinations including sensory function tests and nerve conduction study. However, in diabetic polyneuropathy, clinical symptoms, including numbness, pain, and allodynia, demonstrate no significant correlation with the development of pathophysiological changes in the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, these proposed criteria and scoring systems have failed to become a universal clinical endpoint for large-scale clinical trials evaluating the prognosis in diabetic patients. We should use quantitative examinations of which validity has been proven. Nerve conduction study, for example, has been proven effective to evaluate dysfunctions of large nerve fibers. Baba's classification, which uses a nerve conduction study, is one of the most promising diagnostic methods. Loss of small nerve fibers can be determined using corneal confocal microscopy and intraepidermal nerve fiber density. However, no staging criteria have been proposed using these quantitative evaluations for small fiber neuropathy. To establish a novel diagnostic and staging criteria of diabetic polyneuropathy, we propose three principles to be considered: (1) include only generalizable objective quantitative tests, () exclude clinical symptoms and signs, (3) do not restrictively exclude other causes of polyneuropathy.© 2019 The Authors.

A risk indicator () is calculated as a linear combination of the hazard ratios for the following predictors: age, male gender, , albuminuria, and either CKD, CVD or both. We developed a linear and two exponential expressions to predict the probability of the outcome of -year mortality and compared to actual outcome in the target dataset from NHANES. The risk indicator demonstrated good performance with area under ROC curve of 0.84. The linear and two exponential expressions generated similar predictions in the lower categories of risk indicator ( ≤ 6). However, in the groups with higher  value, the linear expression tends to predict lower, and the exponential expressions higher, probabilities than the observed outcome. A Combined model which averaged the linear and logistic expressions was shown to approximate the actual outcome data the best. A simple technique (named Woodpecker™) allows derivation functional prediction models and risk stratification tools from reports of clinical outcome studies and their application to new populations by using only summary statistics of the new population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678919>Isolated leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and possible fungal meningitis as late sequelae of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>We describe a case of a 67-year-old man with known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type  , hypertension, osteoarthritis, previous history of excess alcohol intake, and oesophagectomy 3 years earlier for T3N0 adenocarcinoma, referred by his general practitioner with confusion, weight loss and several recent falls.

Multivariable analyses were used to assess the joint effects of biomarkers that mediated most strongly in univariable analyses.Early changes after randomization in levels of 3 biomarkers (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, serum bicarbonate, and serum urate) were identified as mediating the effect of canagliflozin on heart failure. Average post-randomization levels of 14 biomarkers (systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, weight, body mass index, gamma glutamyltransferase, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, serum albumin, erythrocyte concentration, serum bicarbonate, and serum urate) were identified as significant mediators. Individually, the 3 biomarkers with the largest mediating effect were erythrocyte concentration (45%), hemoglobin concentration (43%), and serum urate (40%). In a parsimonious multivariable model, erythrocyte concentration, serum urate, and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio were the 3 biomarkers that maximized cumulative mediation (102%).A diverse set of potential mediators of the effect of canagliflozin on heart failure were identified. Some mediating effects were anticipated, whereas others were not. The mediators that were identified support existing and novel hypothesized mechanisms for the prevention of heart failure with sodium glucose cotransporter  inhibitors.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Unsurprisingly, disruptions of the circadian rhythms through sleep curtailment or shift work have been connected through numerous studies to positive associations with obesity, insulin resistance, and . Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measures oscillation in messenger RNA expression, an essential foundation for the study of the physiological circadian regulatory network. Primarily, measured oscillations have involved the use of reference gene normalization. However, the validation and identification of suitable reference genes is a significant challenge across different biological systems. This study focuses on adipose tissue of premenopausal, otherwise healthy, morbidly obese women voluntarily enrolled after being scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Acquisition of tissue was accomplished by aspiratory needle biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue 1 to  weeks prior to surgery and 12 to 13 weeks following surgery and an in-surgery scalpel-assisted excision of mesenteric adipose tissue. Each biopsy was sterile cultured ex vivo and serially collected every 4 h over approximately 36 h. The candidate reference genes that were tested were 18S rRNA, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPII, RPL13α, and YWHAZ. Three analytic tools were used to test suitability, and the candidate reference genes were used to measure oscillation in expression of a known circadian clock element (Dbp). No gene was deemed suitable as an individual reference gene control, which indicated that the optimal reference gene set was the geometrically averaged 3-gene panel composed of YWHAZ, RPL13α, and GAPDH. These methods can be employed to identify optimal reference genes in other systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665380>Plasma Ceramide Species Are Associated with  Risk in Participants of the Strong Heart Study.</a></h2><p>Few studies have assessed the associations of ceramides and sphingomyelins (SMs) with  in humans.We assessed associations of 15 circulating ceramides and SM species with incident  in  studies.The analysis included 435 American-Indian participants from the Strong Heart Study (nested case-control design for analyses; mean age: 57 y; 34% male; median time until  4.3 y for cases) and 1902 participants from the Strong Heart Family Study (prospective design for analyses; mean age: 37 y; 39% male; median 12.5 y of follow-up). Sphingolipid species were measured using stored plasma samples by sequential LC and MS. Using logistic regression and parametric survival models within studies, and an inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis across studies, we examined associations of 15 ceramides and SM species with incident .There were 446 cases of incident  across the studies. Higher circulating concentrations of ceramides containing stearic acid (Cer-18), arachidic acid (Cer-20), and behenic acid (Cer-22) were each associated with a higher risk of . The RRs for incident  per 1 SD of each log ceramide species (μM) were 1.22 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.37) for Cer-18, 1.18 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.31) for Cer-20, and 1.20 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.32) for Cer-22. Although the magnitude of the risk estimates for the association of ceramides containing lignoceric acid (Cer-24) with  was similar to those for Cer-18, Cer-20, and Cer-22 (RR = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.26), the association was not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing (P = 0.007). Ceramides carrying palmitic acid (Cer-16), SMs, glucosyl-ceramides, or a lactosyl-ceramide were not associated with  risk.Higher concentrations of circulating Cer-18, Cer-20, and Cer-22 were associated with a higher risk of developing  in  studies of American-Indian adults.

IGF activity is partly controlled by pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), an enzyme which enhances IGF-action by cleavage of IGF-binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4). To study the role of PAPP-A and the IGF system in diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), we measured immunoreactive (total) concentrations of IGF-I and IGF-II, bioactive IGF by cell-based bioassay, PAPP-A, as well as intact and PAPP-A-cleaved IGFBP-4 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum from patients with type   (T2D) with and without DPN.Twenty-three patients with T2D were included. Based on clinical examination, vibratory perception thresholds and nerve conduction studies, patients were diagnosed with (n = 9) or without (n = 14) DPN.In CSF, PAPP-A activity, as estimated by IGFBP-4 fragment levels, was higher in patients with than without DPN (34.57 vs 13.79 μg/L, p = .003) and concentrations correlated with peripheral nerve impairment measures (r = 0.73, p < .01). Furthermore, serum bioactive IGF was lower in patients with than without DPN (0.8 vs 1.3 μg/L, p = .006) and correlated inversely to the severity of DPN (r = -0.67, p < .01).In both CSF and serum, members of the IGF system correlated with measures of peripheral nerve impairment in patients with T2D. This supports a relationship between the IGF system and the development of DPN. Further studies are needed to clarify if these changes are causally linked to the pathogenesis of DPN.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Individuals completed the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) prior to and immediately after DESMOND participation.Patient Activation significantly increased by 9.7 points from pre to post DESMOND intervention (p < 0.001, z = -7.94). Of all participants who exhibited an increase in patient activation, 87% (n = 142) experienced a clinically significant (>5 point) increase. Post-DESMOND participation, an 86% reduction (from 6% -0.9%) in the proportion of participants scoring in the lowest PAM level (Level 1) was observed (p < 0.01).DESMOND, a structured  self-management education (DSME) program aimed at strengthening the role of people living with type   in self-managing their healthcare, significantly increased patient activation in a real-world setting.In line with international  guidelines it is recommended that people living with T2D, particularly those with lower levels of activation, attend an evidence based DSME such as DESMOND to increase their capacity to effectively self-manage their condition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We tested how a graded reduction in insulin impacts the source of FA used by cardiomyocytes and the cardiac adaptations required to process these FA. Methods and Results Rats injected with 55 (D55) or 100 (D100) mg/kg streptozotocin were terminated after 4 days. Although D55 and D100 were equally hyperglycemic, D100 showed markedly lower pancreatic and plasma insulin and loss of lipoprotein lipase, which in D55 hearts had expanded. There was minimal change in plasma FA in D55. However, D100 exhibited a - to 3-fold increase in various saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA in the plasma. D100 demonstrated dramatic cardiac transcriptomic changes with 1574 genes differentially expressed compared with only 49 in D55. Augmented mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation in D100 was not matched by elevated tricarboxylic acid or oxidative phosphorylation. With increasing FA, although control myocytes responded by augmenting basal respiration, this was minimized in D55 and reversed in D100. Metabolomic profiling identified significant lipid accumulation in D100 hearts, which also exhibited sizeable change in genes related to apoptosis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells. Conclusions With increasing severity of , when the diabetic heart is unable to control its own FA supply using lipoprotein lipase, it undergoes dramatic reprogramming that is linked to handling of excess FA that arise from adipose tissue. This transition results in a cardiac metabolic signature that embraces mitochondrial FA overload, oxidative stress, triglyceride storage, and cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665975>Associations of accelerometer-measured sedentary time, sedentary bouts, and physical activity with adiposity and fitness in children.</a></h2><p>Sedentary time (ST) has been inconsistently associated with adiposity and cardiorespiratory fitness in children in previous studies. We studied cross-sectional associations of ST, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with fat mass index (FMI) and cardiorespiratory fitness (estimated VOmax). Associations were evaluated with and without considering pattern of ST by bout length. We measured ST and activity by a wrist-worn accelerometer, FMI by bioelectrical impedance, and VOmax by Pacer test in 443 children (51.% girls, 10. ± 0.6 years). Isotemporal substitution regression models estimated the effects of substituting ST, LPA, and MVPA on FMI and VOmax. Further models repeated analyses separating ST into short (<10 min) and long (≥10 min) bouts. Only replacing ST or LPA with MVPA was consistently associated with lower FMI and greater VOmax. When separated by bout length, only one unique association was found where replacing long ST bouts with short ST bouts was associated with lower FMI in girls only. In conclusion, activity pattern is associated with adiposity in girls and fitness in boys and girls. Separating ST into long and short ST bouts may be of minimal importance when assessing associations with adiposity and fitness using wrist-worn accelerometry in children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667151>Management of malperfusion syndrome in acute type A aortic intramural hematoma.</a></h2><p>We report the outcomes of acute type A aortic intramural hematoma (ATAAIMH) with malperfusion treated with endovascular intervention and delayed open aortic repair.Between April 1998 and April 2018, 644 patients were treated at our institution with an acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) or ATAAIMH, 82 (13%) had intramural hematomas (IMHs) including 12 (15%) with malperfusion syndrome (MPS) and 70 (85%) without MPS (no MPS). Data was obtained through medical record review, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons data elements, and the National Death Index database.Both MPS and No MPS groups had similar comorbidities including coronary artery disease, hypertension, , and peripheral vascular disease; however, those with MPS were sicker on admission with higher rates of acute renal failure (50% . 1%, P<0.0001) and acute paralysis (17% . 0%, P=0.02). Patients with MPS amenable to endovascular reperfusion (n=10) underwent endovascular fenestration/stenting and delayed aortic repair. Those with cerebral or coronary MPS (n=) and those without MPS (n=70) underwent emergent open aortic repair. Of the ten patients undergoing fenestration/stenting, seven went on to aortic repair, one survived to discharge without aortic repair, one died from aortic rupture on hospital day 34, and one died from organ failure prior to aortic repair. Following endovascular fenestration/stenting or aortic repair, all patients with MPS had higher in-hospital mortality (17% . 0%), P=0.02. Following aortic repair, patients with MPS had more postoperative sepsis and longer postoperative length of stay (all P<0.05). However, both groups had a 0% operative mortality (including in-hospital and 30-day mortality following aortic repair). The 5-year survival of all ATAAIMH patients was 79%. The -year survival was significantly better in the No MPS group (94% . 62%, P=0.006).ATAAIMH with MPS can be effectively managed with upfront endovascular fenestration/stenting followed by delayed aortic repair.2019 Annals of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

However, none have grouped participants into non-diabetics (ND), undiagnosed diabetics (UDD), controlled diabetics (CD) and uncontrolled diabetics (UCD) or investigated what glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) are associated with low NMS (dynapenia) by sex.We analyzed the association between UDD, CD and UCD and dynapenia, the extent to which the different groupings of these individuals modifies this association and the association between HbA1c levels and NMS, by sex, in a cross-sectional study involving 5,290 participants ≥ 50 years from the ELSA study. In the first two analyses, logistic regression models were used with dynapenia (grip strength < 26kg in men and < 16kg in women) as outcome and  [ND, UDD, CD and UCD] as exposure. Next, linear regression was performed with grip strength as outcome and the participants classified based on HbA1c level as exposure. The models were adjusted by sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical characteristics.Compared to ND only UCD was associated with dynapenia (men OR=.37 95% CI 1.36-4.14; women OR=1.67 95% CI 1.01-.79). This association was less clear, particularly in women, when CD and UCD groups were merged. HbA1c ≥ 6.5% in men and ≥ 8.0% in women were associated with lower NMS.UCD increases the chance of dynapenia in both sexes. The different groupings based on  status modify the association between UCD and dynapenia. The threshold of HbA1c associated with reduced NMS is lower in men compared to women.© The Author(s) 2019.

We evaluated SC function by assessing IB and AMH levels at baseline and after three months of each treatment in ten dysmetabolic obese subjects with low T levels. In all subjects,the influence of the clinical characteristics, metabolic and hormonal baseline parameters on SC and Leydig (LC) function, evaluated respectively with AMH, IB, FSH and T levels, were tested.No significant changes were observed for IB and AMH concentrations after each treatment period. Whereas T and estradiol (E2) levels were shown to be significantly higher in the CC plus metformin phase (CC/Met) only. No clinical, metabolic or hormonal parameters showed significant effects on serum AMH at baseline or after treatments.

However, some patients with RTH show thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression due to thyrotoxicosis. We report a case of painless thyroiditis in a patient with RTH that was misdiagnosed as Graves' disease because of TSH-suppressed thyrotoxicosis.A sixteen-year-old boy consulted a local general physician for fatigue. He had a goiter, and biochemical analysis showed TSH < 0.1 μIU/mL, free triiodothyronine (FT3) of .70 pg/mL, and free thyroxine (FT4) of 3.6 ng/dL. He was diagnosed with Graves' disease and was treated with 20 mg thiamazole. One year later, he was referred to the department of endocrinology because of SITSH. He was finally diagnosed with RTH due to the finding of a heterozygous missense mutation (methionine 334 threonine) in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene. Three years after cessation of thiamazole, his hyperthyroxinemia showed marked exacerbation with TSH suppression. We diagnosed him with painless destructive thyroiditis because of low technetium-99 m (Tc-99 m) uptake in the thyroid. Extreme hyperthyroxinemia was ameliorated, with a return to the usual SITSH levels, within 1 month without any treatment.The present case demonstrates that diagnosing RTH is difficult when patients show hyperthyroxinemia with complete suppression of TSH to undetectable levels, and the data lead to misdiagnosis of RTH as Graves' disease. The initial diagnosis is important, and Tc-99 m scintigraphy is useful for the differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis accompanying RTH.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677037>Isoquercetin regulates SREBP-1C via AMPK pathway in skeletal muscle to exert antihyperlipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects in STZ induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p> (DM) is a cluster of metabolic diseases that exhibits high blood glucose levels accompanied by hyperlipidemia and inflammation. DM is the primary risk factor contributes majorly to cardiovascular disease (CVD) mediated morbidity and mortality. The incidence of dyslipidemia seems to attribute considerably to the initiation of CVDs. The beneficial action of isoquercetin on hyperlipidemia and related signaling pathways are not documented yet, hence we decide to carry out this study. The experimental rats were divided into five groups: Group 1, control rats; group , isoquercetin control (40 mg/kg b.w); group 3, diabetic rats (STZ-40 mg/kg b.w); group 4, diabetic + isoquercetin (40 mg/kg b.w); and group 5, diabetic + glibenclamide (600 µg/kg b.w).

Our recent study showed crucial role of adiponectin in the regulation of testicular functions, and the circulating level of adiponectin declines in . The current study thus aimed to examine the efficacy of adiponectin in improving testicular dysfunction in high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced T2D mice. T2D was induced in pre-pubertal mice fed with high-fat diet for ∼10 weeks followed by single treatment of streptozotocin. T2D mice showed presence of increased body mass, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, increased oxidative stress, and declined serum testosterone compared to vehicle-treated control mice. The spermatogenic, steroidogenic, metabolic, and antioxidative parameters were evaluated in T2D mice treated with adiponectin for both two and four weeks. The exogenous administration of adiponectin to T2D mice showed enhanced serum testosterone and expression of testicular steroidogenic markers proteins, insulin receptor and GLUT8 proteins, increase in intra-testicular concentrations of glucose and lactate and activity of LDH and antioxidant enzymes compared to the levels in untreated T2D mice. This suggests that treatment of adiponectin effectively improves testicular functions by increasing expression of insulin receptor-mediated increased transport of energy substrate (glucose and lactate) and a marked reduction in oxidative stress are the possible mechanism by which adiponectin effectively improves testicular function in T2D mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

We hypothesized that hydroxyethyl starch 6% (130/0.4) has a more distinct effect on coagulation and glycocalyx shedding than albumin 5%.Presented data derive from an exploratory subgroup analysis of a prospective randomized, single-blinded trial comparing albumin 5% versus balanced hydroxyethyl starch 6% (130/0.4). Patients between 46 and 85 years undergoing cystectomy were included. Prothrombin time, plasma fibrinogen concentration, partial thromboplastin time, thrombelastometry and platelet function were analyzed before and after surgery. Glycocalyx components were assessed before and after surgery,  to 4 h after surgery and at 1st and 3rd postoperative day. Primary outcome parameter was the change of thrombelastometric variables at the end of surgery. Further variables included calculated blood loss, infusion amount and transfusion rate.55 patients (albumin group n = 28; hydroxyethyl starch group n = 27) were included. Thrombelastometric variables were significantly more compromised in the hydroxyethyl starch than in the albumin group whereas platelet function, glycocalyx shedding, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and fibrinogen were not different between groups. Mean intraoperative calculated blood loss was higher in the hydroxyethyl starch group (1557 ± 825 ml versus 1245 ± 709 ml; p = 0.042). Transfusion requirements did not differ.Rotational thrombelastometric variables were significantly more reduced when hydroxyethyl starch was used compared to albumin 5%. This effect was independent from a shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx. However, results presented here are from a subgroup analysis and must be considered with caution.

Not only that organizations, such as the world health organization (WHO) have identified high blood pressure as one of the main risk factors of the cardiometabolic syndrome, but there is also a link between the occurrence of insulin resistance/impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension that would consequently lead to type-  (T2D). Hypertension is medicated by various classes of synthetic drugs; however, severe or mild adverse effects have been repeatedly reported. To avoid and reduce these adverse effects, natural alternatives, such as bioactive peptides derived from different sources have drawn the attention of researchers. Among all types of biologically active peptides inclusive of marine-derived ones, this paper's focus would solely be on fish and fishery by-processes' extracted peptides and products. Isolation and fractionation processes of these products alongside their structural, compositional and digestion stability characteristics have likewise been briefly discussed to better address the structure-activity relationship, expanding the reader's knowledge on research and discovery trend of fish antihypertensive biopeptides. Furthermore, drug-likeness of selected biopeptides was predicted by Lipinski's rules to differentiate a drug-like biopeptide from nondrug-like one.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669625>Effects of anagliptin on plasma glucagon levels and gastric emptying in patients with type  : an exploratory randomized controlled trial versus metformin.</a></h2><p>Glucagon has an important role in glucose homeostasis. Recently, a new plasma glucagon assay based on liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry was developed. We evaluated the influence of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (anagliptin) on plasma glucagon levels in Japanese patients with type   by using this new assay.Twenty-four patients with type   were enrolled in a prospective, single-center, randomized, open-label study and were randomly allocated to 4 weeks of treatment with metformin (1000 mg/day) or anagliptin (200 mg/day). A liquid test meal labeled with sodium [C] acetate was ingested before and after the treatment period. Samples of blood and expired air were collected over 3 hours. Plasma levels of glucose, glucagon, C-peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) were measured, and gastric emptying was also evaluated.Twenty-two patients completed the study (metformin group: n=10; anagliptin group: n=12). Glycemic control showed similar improvement in both groups. In the anagliptin group, there was a slight decrease of the incremental area under the plasma concentration versus time curve for glucagon after the test meal (P=0.048). In addition, the plasma level of active GLP-1 and GIP was increased, and plasma C-peptide was also increased versus baseline. Neither anagliptin nor metformin delayed gastric emptying.In patients with type   maintained endogenous insulin secretion, anagliptin increased the plasma level of active GLP-1 and GIP in association with a slight stimulation of insulin secretion and slight inhibition of glucagon secretion, but did not delay gastric emptying.Copyright © 2019.

Yet the extent of this improvement and whether it impacts multiple risk factors together is uncertain. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to investigate the effects of text-messaging interventions for CVD prevention.Electronic databases were searched to identify trials investigating a text-messaging intervention focusing on CVD prevention with the potential to modify at least two CVD risk factors in adults. The main outcome was blood pressure (BP). We conducted standard and IPD meta-analysis on pooled data. We accounted for clustering of patients within studies and the primary analysis used random-effects models. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed.Nine trials were included in the systematic review involving 3779 participants and 5 (n=2612) contributed data to the IPD meta-analysis. Standard meta-analysis showed that the weighted mean differences are as follows: systolic blood pressure (SBP), -4.13 mm Hg (95% CI -11.07 to .81, p<0.0001); diastolic blood pressure (DBP), -1.11 mm Hg (-1.91 to -0.31, p=0.002); and body mass index (BMI), -0.32 (-0.49 to -0.16, p=0.000). In the IPD meta-analysis, the mean difference are as follows: SBP, -1.3 mm Hg (-5.4 to .7, p=0.5236); DBP, -0.8 mm Hg (-.5 to 1.0, p=0.3912); and BMI, -0. (-0.8 to 0.4, p=0.5200) in the random-effects model. The impact on other risk factors is described, but there were insufficient data to conduct meta-analyses.Mobile phone text-messaging interventions have modest impacts on BP and BMI. Simultaneous but small impacts on multiple risk factors are likely to be clinically relevant and improve outcome, but there are currently insufficient data in pooled analyses to examine the extent to which simultaneous reduction in multiple risk factors occurs.CRD42016033236.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The target population included individuals with type   (T2D) aged 40 years, without retinopathy, followed over a 40-year time horizon. A Markov model was developed with five health states and a 1-year cycle. Model parameters were based on literature and country databases. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess model parameters' uncertainty. WHO willingness-to-pay (WHO-WTP) thresholds were used as reference (i.e. one and three times the Brazilian per capita Gross Domestic Product of R$32747 in 2018).Compared to usual practice, the systematic teleophthalmology-based screening was associated with an incremental cost of R$21445/QALY gained ($9792/QALY gained). The systematic ophthalmology referral-based screening was more expensive (incremental costs = R$4) and less effective (incremental QALY = -0.012) compared to the systematic teleophthalmology-based screening. The probability of systematic teleophthalmology-based screening being cost-effective compared to usual practice was 0.46 and 0.67 at the minimum and the maximum WHO-WTP thresholds, respectively.Systematic teleophthalmology-based DR screening for the Brazilian population with T2D would be considered very cost effective compared to the opportunistic ophthalmology referral-based screening according to the WHO-WTP threshold.

Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake.

Here, we used a -step approach based on Bayesian transmission reconstruction to (1) identify likely index and missing cases, () determine risk factors associated with transmitters, and (3) estimate when transmission happened.We developed our transmission reconstruction method using genomic and epidemiological data from a population-based study from Valencia Region, Spain. Tuberculosis (TB) incidence during the study period was 8.4 cases per 100,000 people. While the study is ongoing, the sampling frame for this work includes notified TB cases between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016. We identified a total of 21 transmission clusters that fulfilled the criteria for analysis. These contained a total of 117 individuals diagnosed with active TB (109 with epidemiological data). Demographic characteristics of the study population were as follows: 80/109 (73%) individuals were Spanish-born, 76/109 (70%) individuals were men, and the mean age was 42.51 years (SD 18.46). We found that 66/109 (61%) TB patients were sputum positive at diagnosis, and 10/109 (9%) were HIV positive. We used the data to reveal individual transmission links, and to identify index cases, missing cases, likely transmitters, and associated transmission risk factors. Our Bayesian inference approach suggests that at least 60% of index cases are likely misidentified by local public health. Our data also suggest that factors associated with likely transmitters are different to those of simply being in a transmission cluster, highlighting the importance of differentiating between these  phenomena. Our data suggest that type   is a risk factor associated with being a transmitter (odds ratio 0.19 [95% CI 0.02-1.10], p < 0.003). Finally, we used the most likely timing for transmission events to study when TB transmission occurred; we identified that 5/14 (35.7%) cases likely transmitted TB well before symptom onset, and these were largely sputum negative at diagnosis. Limited within-cluster diversity does not allow us to extrapolate our findings to the whole TB population in Valencia Region.In this study, we found that index cases are often misidentified, with downstream consequences for epidemiological investigations because likely transmitters can be missed. Our findings regarding inferred transmission timing suggest that TB transmission can occur before patient symptom onset, suggesting also that TB transmits during sub-clinical disease. This result has direct implications for diagnosing TB and reducing transmission. Overall, we show that a transition to individual-based genomic epidemiology will likely close some of the knowledge gaps in TB transmission and may redirect efforts towards cost-effective contact investigations for improved TB control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669079>Vitamin D Supplementation during Pregnancy: An Evidence Analysis Center Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Given the high rates of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women and possible effects on offspring health, a systematic review on this topic was conducted to help inform future practice guidelines.To evaluate associations between maternal vitamin D supplementation, maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, and health outcomes.A PubMed literature search was conducted to identify studies that examined the health effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and infant health outcomes published from 2000 to 2016. Among 976 identified publications, 20 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The initial search was extended to include five studies published between July 2016 and September 2018.Maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations, gestational , preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, cesarean section, maternal parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations, and infant gestational age, birth weight, and birth length.Mean differences, odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, only for the initial search, using separate random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome.Evidence was good or strong that maternal vitamin D supplementation significantly increased maternal (13 studies, n=18, mean difference, 14.1 ng/mL [35. nmol/L]; 95% CI=9.6-18.6 ng/mL [24.0-46.4 nmol/L]) and infant (nine studies, n=12; 9.7, 5., 14. ng/mL [24., 12.9, 35.5 nmol/L]) 25(OH)D concentrations, although heterogeneity was significant (I=95.9% and I=97.4, respectively, P<0.001). Evidence was fair that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases maternal homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (five studies, n=7; -1.1, -1.5, -0.7) and increases infant birth weight (nine studies, n=11, 114., 63.4, 165.1 g), both had insignificant heterogeneity. A null effect of maternal supplementation on other maternal (preeclampsia, cesarean section) and infant (gestational age, birth length) outcomes was found.Results show vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations and may play a role in maternal insulin resistance and fetal growth. To further inform practice and policies on the amount of vitamin D, which supports a healthy pregnancy, high quality dose-response randomized clinical trials, which assess pregnancy-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, and appropriately powered clinical outcomes are needed.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Tg6 mice with chronic erythropoietin overexpression have a high hematocrit, reduced trabecular and cortical bone and bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein  driven ectopic bone and adipocyte formation. Erythropoietin treatment (1 200 IU·kg) for 10 days similarly exhibit increased hematocrit, reduced bone and bone marrow adipocytes without increased osteoclasts, and reduced bone morphogenic protein signaling in the bone marrow. Interestingly, endogenous erythropoietin is required for normal differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells to osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes. ΔEpoR mice with erythroid restricted erythropoietin receptor exhibit reduced trabecular bone, increased bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein  ectopic bone formation. Erythropoietin treated ΔEpoR mice achieved hematocrit similar to wild-type mice without reduced bone, suggesting that bone reduction with erythropoietin treatment is associated with non-erythropoietic erythropoietin response. Bone marrow stromal cells from wild-type, Tg6, and ΔEpoR-mice were transplanted into immunodeficient mice to assess development into a bone/marrow organ. Like endogenous bone formation, Tg6 bone marrow cells exhibited reduced differentiation to bone and adipocytes indicating that high erythropoietin inhibits osteogenesis and adipogenesis, while ΔEpoR bone marrow cells formed ectopic bones with reduced trabecular regions and increased adipocytes, indicating that loss of erythropoietin signaling favors adipogenesis at the expense of osteogenesis. In summary, endogenous erythropoietin signaling regulates bone marrow stromal cell fate and aberrant erythropoietin levels result in their impaired differentiation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679650></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675081>Association Between Switching to a High-Deductible Health Plan and Discontinuation of Type   Treatment.</a></h2><p>High-deductible health plans (HDHPs) are a common cost-savings option for employers but may lead to underuse of necessary treatments because beneficiaries bear the full cost of health care, including medications, until a deductible is met.To evaluate the association between switching from a non-HDHP to an HDHP and discontinuation of antihyperglycemic medication and to assess whether the association differs in patients using branded vs generic antihyperglycemic medications.This retrospective matched cohort study used administrative claims from MarketScan databases to identify commercially insured adult patients with type   who used at least 1 antihyperglycemic medication in 2013. Patients in the HDHP cohort (n = 1490) were matched by propensity scores to a non-HDPH control cohort (n = 1490). Data were collected and analyzed from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2014.Switching from a non-HDHP in 2013 to a full replacement HDHP in 2014 (no non-HDHP option offered) vs staying on a non-HDHP.Difference-in-differences models estimated discontinuation of branded and generic antihyperglycemic medications.Among the 2980 patients included in the analysis (1932 men [64.8%]; mean [SD] age, HDHP cohort: 52.6 [6.9] years; non-HDHP cohort: 52.7 [7.3] years), no difference between the HDHP and non-HDHP cohorts was found in unadjusted follow-up discontinuation rates for all antihyperglycemic medications (255 [22.7%] vs 255 [23.3%]; P = .72); however, among patients using branded medication, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the HDHP group did not refill branded medications (81 of 396 [20.5%] vs 61 of 437 [14.0%]; P = .009). Difference-in-differences models were not statistically significant.These findings suggest switching to an HDHP is associated with discontinuation specifically of branded medications. Unintended health consequences may result and should be considered by employers making health care benefit decisions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675917>Optimizing microbiome sequencing for small intestinal aspirates: validation of novel techniques through the REIMAGINE study.</a></h2><p>The human small intestine plays a central role in the processes of digestion and nutrient absorption. However, characterizations of the human gut microbiome have largely relied on stool samples, and the associated methodologies are ill-suited for the viscosity and low microbial biomass of small intestine samples. As part of the REIMAGINE study to examine the specific roles of the small bowel microbiome in human health and disease, this study aimed to develop and validate methodologies to optimize microbial analysis of the small intestine.Subjects undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy without colon preparation for standard of care were prospectively recruited, and ~  ml samples of luminal fluid were obtained from the duodenum using a custom sterile aspiration catheter. Samples of duodenal aspirates were either untreated (DA-U, N = 127) or pretreated with dithiothreitol (DA-DTT, N = 101), then cultured on MacConkey agar for quantitation of aerobic gram-negative bacteria, typically from the class Gammaproteobacteria, and on blood agar for quantitation of anaerobic microorganisms. DA-DTT exhibited .86-fold greater anaerobic bacterial counts compared to DA-U (P = 0.0101), but were not statistically different on MacConkey agar. DNA isolation from DA-U (N = 112) and DA-DTT (N = 43) samples and library preparation for 16S rRNA gene sequencing were also performed using modified protocols. DA-DTT samples exhibited 3.81-fold higher DNA concentrations (P = 0.0014) and 4.18-fold higher 16S library concentrations (P < 0.0001) then DA-U samples. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed increases in the detected relative abundances of obligate and facultative anaerobes in DA-DTT samples, including increases in the genera Clostridium (false discovery rate (FDR) P = 4.38E-6), Enterococcus (FDR P = .57E-8), Fusobacterium (FDR P = 0.02) and Bacteroides (FDR P = 5.43E-9). Detected levels of Gram-negative enteropathogens from the phylum Proteobacteria, such as Klebsiella (FDR P = .73E-6) and Providencia (FDR P < 0.0001) (family Enterobacteriaceae) and Pseudomonas (family Pseudomonadaceae) (FDR P = 0.04), were also increased in DA-DTT samples.This study validates novel DTT-based methodology which optimizes microbial culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing for the study of the small bowel microbiome. The microbial analyses indicate increased isolation of facultative and obligate anaerobes from the mucus layer using these novel techniques.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675254>A new index of clinical utility for diagnostic tests.</a></h2><p>Clinical utility of a diagnostic test depends on its diagnostic accuracy, the pretest probability of disease and the clinical consequences of the test results. Tools for evaluating clinical utility are scarce. We propose a new clinical utility index (CUI), which is the expected gain in utility (EGU) of the test divided by the EGU of an ideal test, both adjusted for EGU of the optimal clinical action without testing. The index expresses the relative benefit of using the test compared to using an optimal test when making a clinical decision. To illustrate how the index may be used, we estimated CUI for fasting glucose, both as a continuous and as a dichotomous test, at several values of pretest probability of  and at two levels of cost/benefit-ratio. In the same clinical situations we also estimated CUI for the  h glucose tolerance test. Hemoglobin A1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol was used as a reference standard for . In this model, fasting glucose was clinically more useful as a continuous test than as a dichotomous one, based on CUIs. At pretest probability above the treatment threshold, fasting glucose as a continuous test was even more useful than the complete glucose tolerance test. These results are not necessarily generalizable; however, they show how the CUI can be used to select the most useful test in certain clinical situations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662728>Written Examinations in Swedish Medical Schools: Minds Molded to Medicate?</a></h2><p>Lifestyle medicine (LM) is part of official educational goals in Swedish medical schools.

This study was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. The combined intervention consisted of 10 sessions of HBOT before the intrapancreatic infusion of ASC and 10 sessions afterwards. ASCs were infused into the main arterial supply of the pancreas to maximize the presence of the stem cells where the therapeutic effect is most desired. A total of 23 patients were included (control group = 10, intervention group = 13). Age, gender,  duration, number of medications taken, body weight and height, and insulin requirements were recorded at baseline and every three months. Also, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, C-peptide, and HbA1c, C-peptide/glucose ratio (CPGR) were measured every three months for one year. HbA1c was significantly lower in the intervention group compared with control throughout follow-up. Overall, 77% of patients in the intervention group and 30% of patients in the control group demonstrated a decrease of HbA1c at 180 days (compared with baseline) of at least 1 unit. Glucose levels were significantly lower in the intervention group at all timepoints during follow-up. C-peptide levels were significantly higher in the intervention group during follow-up and at one year: 1.9 ± 1.0 ng/mL versus 0.7 ± 0.4 ng/mL in intervention versus control groups, respectively,  = 0.0021. CPGR was higher in the intervention group at all controls during follow-up. The requirement for insulin was significantly lower in the intervention group at 90, 180, 270, and 365 days. Combined therapy of intrapancreatic ASC infusion and HBOT showed increased metabolic control and reduced insulin requirements in patients with T2DM compared with standard treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668588>Achievement of cardiovascular risk factor targets according to sex and previous history of cardiovascular disease in type  : A population-based study.</a></h2><p>The main objective was to assess, using real-practice primary care records, the degree of control of cardiovascular risk factor targets. Records were stratified by the presence of previous history or cardiovascular disease (CVD), and sex differences in the fulfillment profile were analyzed.This is a cross-sectional population-based study conducted in Spain. Type   patients over 20 years old (n = 32,638) were identified from primary care electronic health records, and the following information was extracted: glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, triglycerides, BMI and smoking history.Patients with CVD had worse control of HbA1c than patients without it, (HbA1c < 7% 56.9% vs. 61.%) but better control of BP (<130/80: 43.5% vs 38.%) and lipids. In the group without prior CVD history, women had worse control of HbA1c, LDL, HDL, BMI and triglycerides and better control of blood pressure and smoking. These differences were maintained or accentuated in the group with previous CVD.Women had poorer control of CV risk factors in both groups, and the sex-gap is accentuated in patients with previous CVD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<5%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±5.9yrs, BMI: 29.5±5.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily energy expenditure, hypertension and . Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and . More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat metabolism and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis.

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. This study was designed to investigate the influences of tanshinone IIA, an active compound extracted from Chinese herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, on the proliferation and migration of human aortic VSMCs (HASMCs). cultured in a high glucose medium and the underlying mechanisms related miRNAs. Using a miRNA microarray method, we profiled the miRNA expression signature in human aortic VSMCs (HASMCs) exposed to normal glucose, high glucose with and without Tanshinone IIA. Cell proliferation was measured with 5-bromo-'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. Cell migration was evaluated using transwell migration assay and wound scratch assay. Western blot was used to examine the expression of tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) and miRNA level was quantified by real-time PCR. The results showed that several miRNAs that were highly expressed in the high glucose group were significantly decreased in the high glucose with Tanshinone IIA group compared with the normal glucose group (P < 0.05). Among these miRNAs, miR-21-5p was significantly upregulated in the high glucose group and downregulated after Tanshinone IIA treatment (P < 0.05). The depletion of miR-21-5p in HASMCs resulted in decreased cell proliferation and migration (P < 0.05). Moreover, we found that Tanshinone ⅡA inhibited proliferation and migration partly through miR-21-5p-mediated TPM1 downregulation (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that Tanshinone IIA is able to protect HASMCs from high glucose-induced proliferation and migration through regulating expression of miRNAs.Copyright © 2019.

Helminth infection has both nutritional and immunological impact on their definitive hosts. Thus, a cross-sectional study was performed to see the effects of OV infection on glucose and lipid profiles. For this purpose, 200 each of OV infected and uninfected residents were recruited and their glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, triglycerides, low- and high-density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL) levels and anthropometric measurements, including BMI were examined. Then, as the prospective follow- up study, changes of those metabolic parameters of OV positive subjects (n = 120) before and after Praziquantel (PZQ) treatment were monitored for six months. The results showed that OV infection has a protective effect against hyperglycemia (OR 0.482 and p = .04) and metabolic disease risk group (OR 0.478 and p = .03).

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of , hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (.%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR .5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

T2DM model in C57BL/6J mice was established by high fat diet (HFD) and single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Both HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice and normal mice received 6 h isoflurane exposure. Blood glucose level and serum insulin concentration were detected and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated to estimate peripheral IR. Relative levels of genes and proteins in the insulin-dependent signaling pathway in mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined to measure central IR. Results indicated that 6 h isoflurane exposure induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and raised HOMA-IR index. Meanwhile, phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) (Ser639) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate- (pIRS2) (Ser731) were upregulated, while phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) (Ser473) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (pGSK3β) (Ser9) were downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of anesthetized mice. Notably, isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravated the degree of central IR in the aspects of gene transcriptions and protein expressions in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice with pre-existing IR. This study suggested that isoflurane anesthesia induced peripheral and central IR and aggravated pre-existing insulin resistance in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019.

It has been shown that dexamethasone promotes t-tubule development in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and that cardiomyocyte-specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) knockout (GRKO) leads to heart failure. Here, we studied if the t-system is altered in GRKO hearts and if GR signalling is required for t-system preservation in adult cardiomyocytes. Confocal and 3D STED microscopy of myocardium from cardiomyocyte-specific GRKO mice revealed decreased t-system density and increased distances between ryanodine receptors (RyR) and L-type Ca channels (LTCC). Because t-system remodelling and heart failure are intertwined, we investigated the underlying mechanisms in vitro. Ventricular cardiomyocytes from failing human and healthy adult rat hearts cultured in the absence of glucocorticoids (CTRL) showed distinctively lower t-system density than cells treated with dexamethasone (EC 1.1 nM) or corticosterone. The GR antagonist mifepristone abrogated the effect of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone improved RyR-LTCC coupling and synchrony of intracellular Ca release, but did not alter expression levels of t-system-associated proteins junctophilin- (JPH2), bridging integrator-1 (BIN1) or caveolin-3 (CAV3). Rather, dexamethasone upregulated LC3B and increased autophagic flux. The broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine prevented dexamethasone-induced upregulation of autophagy and t-system preservation, and autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A and chloroquine accelerated t-system loss. Conversely, induction of autophagy by rapamycin or amino acid starvation preserved the t-system. These findings suggest that GR signalling and autophagy are critically involved in t-system preservation and remodelling in the heart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676984>Glucose-Responsive Microspheres as a Smart Drug Delivery System for Controlled Release of Insulin.</a></h2><p>, a disease of glucose regulation, has become one of the most common medical problems in the world. At present, alternative therapy for  has, to a large extent, been widely concerned with the improvement of treatment efficacy. The aims of this study were to characterize and evaluate the surface morphology of the novel glucose-responsive injectable microspheres containing insulin, along with their in vitro release and in vivo efficacy.In this study, glucose-responsive microspheres as an emerging smart drug delivery system for controlled release of insulin were developed by an improved water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double emulsion preparation method. Here, methoxypolyethylene glycol-hydrazone-4-methoxypolyethylene glycol benzoate (mPEG-Hz-mPEG4AB) was synthesized as a pH-responsive carrier.The microspheres had a good spherical structure with a particle size of 5 ~ 10 μm. Approximately 61% of insulin was released in 15 h under a high glucose environment but was barely released within the normal glucose range in in vitro studies. After a subcutaneous injection of insulin microspheres in rats, blood glucose levels rapidly decreased within  h and could be maintained for  days in the normal range. Histopathological evaluation indicated that the microspheres were almost non-irritating.The pH-responsive mPEG-Hz-mPEG4AB could be used as an efficient insulin microsphere carrier, and the optimized microspheres had good morphology and sustained hypoglycemic effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675725>Endoscopic endonasal cyst fenestration into the sphenoid sinus using the mucosa coupling method for symptomatic Rathke's cleft cyst: a novel method for maintaining cyst drainage to prevent recurrence.</a></h2><p>Rathke's cleft cyst (RCC) is a benign cystic lesion with a relatively high incidence of local recurrence that occasionally requires repeat surgery. To prevent recurrence, simple cyst fenestration and drainage of the cyst contents to the sphenoid sinus is recommended, but it occasionally recurs. The authors postulated that obstruction of fenestration is a main cause of recurrence, and they developed a method, named the "mucosa coupling method (MC method)," that maintains persistent drainage. In this method, the RCC epithelium and the mucosa of the sphenoid sinus are connected, which promotes re-epithelialization between the two epithelia, maintaining persistent drainage. The outcome of this method was compared with that of conventional cyst fenestration.In a consecutive series of 40 patients with RCC, the surgical strategy was changed during the study period: from December 2009 to September 2014 (the conventional period), 24 patients were scheduled to be treated using the conventional fenestration method, whereas from September 2014 to September 2017 (the MC period), 16 patients were scheduled to be treated using the MC method. However, because of an intraoperative CSF leak, the fenestration was closed during surgery in 3 patients in the conventional period and  in the MC period; therefore, these 5 patients were excluded from the analysis. Twenty-one patients treated with the conventional fenestration method (conventional group) and 14 patients treated with the MC method (MC group) were analyzed. All patients regularly underwent MRI after surgery to detect reaccumulation of cyst contents. The rate of reaccumulation with and without reoperation, visual outcomes, endocrinological outcomes, and postoperative complications were compared between these two groups.The median follow-up period in all 35 patients was 48.0 months (range 1-96 months), 54.0 months (range 1-96 months) in the conventional group and 35.5 months (range 12-51 months) in the MC group. No reaccumulation was detected on MRI in the 14 patients in the MC group, whereas it was noted in 9 (42.9%) of 21 patients in the conventional group, and  of these 9 patients required repeat surgery. There were no significant differences in visual and endocrinological outcomes and complications between these two groups.The MC method for RCC is effective for preventing obstruction of cyst fenestration, which contributes to preventing cyst reaccumulation. Furthermore, this method is equivalent to the conventional fenestration method in terms of visual and endocrinological outcomes and the complication rate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665268>Combinations of Cardiac and Non-cardiac Predictors for Prognoses in Patients with Acute Heart Failure.</a></h2><p>In contemporary heart failure (HF) practice, prognostic value for combinations of cardiac and non-cardiac predictors remains poorly understood. We analyzed combinatorial predictors of outcomes in acute HF patients.This longitudinal cohort study included consecutive patients admitted for acute decompensated HF between April 2015 and March 2018 in an urban hospital. The main outcomes are HF readmission within 6 months after discharge or all-cause death. A total of 451 patients with 662 admissions were enrolled and the data including frailty and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed by multivariate and matched cohort analyses.The mean age of patients was 76.8 years. We constructed a Multi-frailty Index (MFI) ranging from 0 to 3 points as a composite of non-cardiac comorbidities and biopsychosocial frailty. In matched cohort of patients with EF ≧50% (HFpEF), MFI ≧1, pulmonary hypertension (peak flow velocity of tricuspid regurgitation ≧.9 m/s by echocardiography), and pancytopenia at discharge were strong predictors of HF readmission (Odds ratios, 4.33, .5, and .86; p = 0.02, 0.05, and 0.02, respectively), and MFI ≧ was the only predictor for all-cause death. For EF < 40%, age, BNP ≧800 pg/ml, increase in estimated GFR during hospitalization, and lymphocytopenia plus anemia predicted HF readmission (Odds ratios, 1.77, .72, 0.73, and .89; p = 0.001, 0.05, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively). In contrast,  was the only specific predictor found in patients over 80 years old.These data identified multi-frailty and pulmonary hypertension or mild pancytopenia as synergistic predictors of HF readmission in HFpEF patients.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between muscle fatigability and micro and macrovascular complications in patients with T2DM.One-hundred and forty-six patients with T2DM (80 males, 66 females, aged 66.9 ± 7.9 years) were recruited. Maximal voluntary contraction (MCV) and endurance time (ET, 50% of the MVC) were assessed at the knee extensor muscles with an isometric dynamometer. Univariate and multivariate correlations of ET values with diabetic complications, a wide range of surrogate measures of these sequelae, and cardiovascular risk factors were examined.A higher muscle fatigability was detected in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN, ET: -32.4%), cardiovascular disease (CVD, ET: -32.1%), retinopathy (ET: -35.8%), and nephropathy (ET: -30.4%). At univariate analysis, muscle fatigability was associated with age, physical activity level,  duration, HbA , systolic blood pressure, albuminuria, eGFR, and several parameters of nervous and vascular function. Multivariate analysis showed that, after adjusting for covariates, ET was independently associated with sensory nerve conduction velocity, vibration perception threshold at malleolus, and ankle-brachial index. In addition, ET values were independently associated with the presence of DPN, CVD, and retinopathy.In T2DM, muscle fatigability is associated with presence of DPN, CVD, and retinopathy. Such defect appears to be mediated predominantly by sensory nerve and peripheral vascular dysfunction.This article is protected by copyright.

To test whether the difference might be explained by rapid tachyphylaxis in response to elevated concentrations of GIP, and whether patients with type   and their relatives are more susceptible to tachyphylaxis than healthy subjects.In a two-way crossover design, insulinotropic responses to repeated bolus injection (50 pmol/kg body weight at 30 and 120 min) and continuous infusion of GIP ( pmol.kg-1.min-1 from 30-180 min) under hyperglycaemic clamp conditions (8.5 mmol/l) was compared in age- gender- and weight-matched patients with type  , first degree relatives of such patients, and healthy subjects.Insulin secretory responses to the first and second GIP bolus were not significantly different in any of the subject groups. Subjects with type   had a significant relative impairment versus healthy subjects with continuous (C-peptide, -13. %, p < 0.05), but not with repeated bolus administration of GIP (+11.1 %, n.s.). First-degree relatives tended to hyper-secrete insulin with bolus or continuous administrations of GIP.Rapid tachyphylaxis in response to continuous exposure to slightly supraphysiological concentrations of GIP does not explain the reduced insulinotropic response to GIP infusions in patients with type   or their first-degree relatives.Copyright © 2019.

The objective of the study was to verify the association between body mass index (BMI) and severity of CAD, its risk factors and surgical and percutaneous treatment in patients hospitalized in cardiological units.An ambispective, cross-sectional study was performed with patients older than 18 years attended by nutrition in the cardiology units, who underwent coronary angiography. The severity of CAD was categorized into two distinct classifications (CAD Class I and II), considering the presence of CAD as lesions ≥50% and ≥70%. The nutritional status of the patient was established based on BMI according to the World Health Organization (WHO) for the total sample and group of adults, and according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for the elderly. Age, gender, presence of associated comorbidities, history of smoking, and performed procedures were collected in patients' records. For statistical analysis Kruskal Wallis and Chi-square tests were used, and Hodges-Lehmann estimate was used for the median. Comparisons and associations were considered significant when p < 0.05.A total of 703 patients were included, of which 495 had arterial lesions ≥70% and 513 patients' lesions ≥50%. The average age was 61 years, women were older (63 vs 61; p = 0.008), had a higher BMI (28.16 kg/m vs 26.68 kg/m, p = 0.001) and were more likely to have  (DM) (p < 0.001), dyslipidemia (DSLP) (p < 0.001), and hypertension (HTN) (p = 0.001). The majority of the sample consisted of men, who more often underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (53,9% vs 39%, p < 0.001), and were more likely to present more severe CAD (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003). In patients diagnosed with CAD the increase in BMI was positively associated with the presence of DM (p < 0.001), DSLP (p < 0.001) and HTN (p < 0.001), and negatively with age (p = 0.007). Patients with obesity III, were diagnosed with CAD, in average, 11 years earlier than patients with normal BMI (p = 0.05). Therefore, the higher the BMI, the lower the age at the moment of the examination in the total sample, and in the group of elderly, and this association was not found in adults. There was no significant association of BMI with the severity of CAD, or with PCI and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The greater severity of CAD was positively associated with the presence of DM (p = 0.012 and p = 0.001), HTN (p = 0.033 and p = 0.003) and older age (p = 0.005 and p = 0.015). Patients who underwent CABG had a higher incidence of and HTN (p = 0.003), DM (p = 0.006), whereas patients who had PCI had a lower incidence of HTN (p = 0.021) and DM (p = 0.004).Obesity was showed to be as an independent risk factor for the early incidence of CAD, which is strongly associated with the presence of comorbidities such as DM, HTN and DSLP. The greater severity of CAD and coronary interventions were associated with the presence of risk factors for CAD.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Primary outcome was disease remission after drug withdrawal or surgery. Secondary outcomes were biochemical control and side effects during dopamine agonist treatment and postoperative complications. Fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled proportions. Robustness of results was assessed by sensitivity analyses.A total of 1469 articles were screened: 55 (10 low risk of bias) on medical treatment (n=3564 patients) and 25 (12 low risk of bias) on transsphenoidal surgery (n=1836 patients). Long-term disease remission after dopamine agonist withdrawal was 34% (95%CI 26-46%) and 67% (95% CI 60-74%) after surgery. Subgroup analysis of microprolactinomas showed 36% (95% CI 21-52%) disease remission after dopamine agonist withdrawal and 83% (95% CI 76-90%) after surgery. Biochemical control was achieved in 81% (95% CI 75-87%) of patients during dopamine agonists with side effects in 26% (95%CI 13-41%). Transsphenoidal surgery resulted in 0% mortality, % (95% CI 0-5%) permanent , and 3% (95% CI -5%) cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Multiple sensitivity analyses yielded similar results.In the majority of prolactinoma patients disease remission can be achieved through surgery, with low risks of long-term surgical complications, and disease remission is less often achieved with dopamine agonists.© Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666833>Normalization of heart rate variability with taurine and meldonium complex in post-infarction patients with type  .</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study is to scrutiny the Dynamics of heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with PICS with 2nd type DM against the background of Taurine (TN) and meldonium (ME).

Epidemiological studies have associated measles with increased morbidity and mortality for years after infection, but the reasons why are poorly understood. Measles virus infects immune cells, causing acute immune suppression. To identify and quantify long-term effects of measles on the immune system, we used VirScan, an assay that tracks antibodies to thousands of pathogen epitopes in blood. We studied 77 unvaccinated children before and  months after natural measles virus infection. Measles caused elimination of 11 to 73% of the antibody repertoire across individuals. Recovery of antibodies was detected after natural reexposure to pathogens. Notably, these immune system effects were not observed in infants vaccinated against MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), but were confirmed in measles-infected macaques. The reduction in humoral immune memory after measles infection generates potential vulnerability to future infections, underscoring the need for widespread vaccination.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Our meta-analysis focuses on observed change in HbA1c at either , 3 or 4 months, in adult or paediatric subjects, as well as a longitudinal analysis up to 12 months in adult subjects. These data were drawn from 25 of the studies identified in our initial search. These reported HbA1c data up to 12 months in a total of 1723 participants with type 1  (T1D) or type   (T2D) using the FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system.Overall mean change in laboratory HbA1c across study subjects at -4 months was - 0.55% (95% CI - 0.70, - 0.39).

This study aimed to clarify the effects of weekly working time according to frequencies of night shifts during pregnancy on adverse outcomes in Japan.The Japan Environment and Children's Study, a prospective cohort study, was conducted in 15 regions nationwide in Japan. The study population included pregnant women with singleton pregnancies (n = 99 744). The mothers' working hours and frequencies of night shifts during the first and the second/third trimesters were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. Outcome data were collected from medical transcripts.Compared with nonworking women, women who worked during pregnancy had significantly increased adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of threatened miscarriage (maximum aOR: 1.47, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.26-1.73) and of threatened preterm labor (maximum aOR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.41-1.87). Increased aORs were observed for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (maximum aOR: .02, 95% CI: 1.39-.93) in women working ≥36 hours per week with night shifts, for vacuum/forceps delivery (maximum aOR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.22-1.48) at ≥36 hours with or without night shifts, and for small-for-gestational-age babies (aOR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.10-1.59) at ≥46 hours with night shifts. In contrast, lower aORs were observed for gestational  and meconium-stained amniotic fluid in women working without night shifts.Work during pregnancy slightly increased the risks of threatened miscarriage and threatened preterm labor. Long working hours increased the risks of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, vacuum/forceps delivery, and small-for-gestational-age babies.© 2019 The Authors.

We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose insulin sensitivity index [OGIS]). The liver insulin resistance index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including fat mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to fat mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001), liver insulin resistance (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance ( h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in insulin sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and insulin sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals.

However, this has not been reflected in previous reviews, possibly because they did not differentiate between patients with and without peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of published literature in the MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL databases on non-ischemic diabetic foot ulcers with outcome measures including complete ulcer healing, amputation rate (major and minor) and mortality. Seven studies were included, of which two were randomized clinical trials. Two studies found no difference in major amputation rate, whereas one large retrospective study found % more major amputations in the hyperbaric oxygen group. However, this study did not correct for baseline differences. Two studies showed no significant difference in minor amputation rate. Five studies reporting on complete wound healing showed no significant differences. In conclusion, the current evidence suggests that hyperbaric oxygen therapy does not accelerate wound healing and does not prevent major or minor amputations in patients with a diabetic foot ulcer without peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Based on the available evidence, routine clinical use of this therapy cannot be recommended. However, the available research for this specific subgroup of patients is scarce, and physicians should counsel patients on expected risks and benefits. Additional research, focusing especially on patient selection criteria, is needed to better identify patients that might profit from this therapy modality. This article is protected by copyright.

We focused on medical therapy of , dyslipidemia, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and smoke habits.In total, at admission, 66.6% of patients had HbA1c levels higher than recommended; 65.9% of patients were on statins; 81.4 % on anti-hypertensive treatment and 72.4% on antiplatelet drugs. Concerning smoke habits, 27% of patients were no-smokers; 41% former smokers and 32% active smokers. Among all patients, only 24% were prescribed all five guideline recommended therapies while 32% reached four out of five of these. As for patients treated with anti-hypertensive drugs, we observed higher levels of systolic pressure (138.0±29.5 vs 107.7±36.6 p<0.02) while no differences were observed in diastolic pressure levels.In conclusion, when it comes to diabetic patients with a severe limb and life threatening clinical condition, we noticed a lower-than-expected application of international guideline-recommended medical therapies. In fact, only one out of four patients was following all the recommended therapies. Nevertheless, these patients did not reach the standard targets requested to prevent cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2019.

CMC statuses for Auckland residents were modelled using hospitalization ICD-10 codes, pharmaceutical claims, and laboratory results. Population-level influenza rates in adults with congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma,  (DM), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were calculated by Poisson regression stratified by age and adjusted for ethnicity.Among 891,276 adults, ,435 influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations occurred. Rates were significantly higher in those with CMCs compared with those without the respective CMC except older adults with DM or those aged <65 years with CVA. The largest effects occurred with CHF (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] range: 4.84-13.4 across age strata), ESRD (IRR range: 3.30-9.02), CAD (IRR range= .77-10.7), and COPD (IRR range: 5.89-8.78) and tapered with age.Our findings support the increased risk of severe, laboratory-confirmed influenza disease among adults with specific CMCs compared those without these conditions.© The Author(s) 2019.

Multislice CT (MSCT) is a non-invasive alternative to coronary angiography (CAG) suggested for patients with a low-to-intermediate risk of CAD. No established definition of such patients exists. Our purpose was to develop a simple score to identify as large a group as possible with a suitable pretest risk of CAD.Retrospective study of patients in Denmark undergoing CAG due to newly diagnosed HF from 2010 to 2014. All Danish patients were registered in two databases according to geographical location. We used data from one registry and multiple logistic regression with backwards elimination to find predictors of CAD and used the derived OR to develop a clinical risk score called the CT-HF score, which was subsequently validated in the other database.The main cohort consisted of 2171 patients and the validation cohort consisted of 2795 patients with 24% and 27% of patients having significant CAD, respectively. Among significant predictor, the strongest was extracardiac arteriopathy (OR .84). Other significant factors were male sex, smoking, hyperlipidaemia, , angina and age. A proposed cut-off of 9 points identified 61% of patients with a 15% risk of having CAD, resulting in an estimated savings of 15% of the cost and 21% of the radiation.A simple score based on clinical risk factors could identify HF patients with a low risk of CAD; these patients may have benefitted from MSCT as a gatekeeper for CAG.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Enhanced thromboxane (TX)-dependent platelet activation plays a pivotal role in atherothrombosis and characterizes type   (DM). Whether this also pertains to IGT is currently unknown. We investigated whether TXA -dependent platelet activation, as reflected by 11-dehydro-TXB (TXM) urinary excretion, is comparably abnormal in IGT as in DM; is persistent over long-term follow-up; changes as a function of metabolic disease progression; is influenced by food intake.We prospectively investigated subjects with IGT (n=48), and two control groups with DM diagnosed either <12 months (n=60) or ≥12 months (n=58).Baseline TXM excretion was comparable between subjects with IGT and DM, with no evidence of a circadian variation.

Such data are important in order to contextualize the incidence of various cardiovascular outcomes among cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials of new agents and for postmarketing surveillance.A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) population of cancer patients. The inclusion criterion was a KPNC Cancer Registry diagnosis of any of several selected solid and hematologic tumors between 1997 and 2009 not treated with a TKI. Endpoints were identified using ICD-9 codes and included acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, stroke, cardiac arrest, hypertension, venous thromboembolism, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. Event rates were calculated according to type of cancer and number of cardiovascular risk factors.The study included almost 165 000 individuals with a broad variety of tumor types. The parent cohort was 54% female and 35% were ≥70 years old. Cardiovascular risk factors such as  (14% of patients with solid tumors, 15% of patients with liquid tumors), dyslipidemia (33%, 31%), hypertension (50%, 49%), and smoking (35%, 32%) were common. The most frequent adverse outcomes were incident hypertension (26.8-61.0 cases per 1000 person-years, depending on the type of cancer), heart failure (9.4-78.7), and acute coronary syndrome (.6-48.1). These event rates are high compared to what has been reported in prior KPNC cohort studies of patients without cancer. The rates of acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and ischemic stroke increased with increasing numbers of cardiovascular risk factors.In a population of patients with cancer not exposed to TKIs, cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes are very common, regardless of cancer type. These data can inform the evaluation of potential excess cardiovascular risks from new interventions.© 2019 The Authors.

However, there are no data available on reverse remodelling after TAVI assessed by CT. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the predictors and the prognostic value of left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling following TAVI using CT angiography.We investigated 117 patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent CT scanning before and after TAVI procedure with a mean follow-up time of .6 years after TAVI. We found a significant reduction in LV mass (LVM) and LVM indexed to body surface area comparing pre- vs. post-TAVI images: 180.5 ± 53.0 vs. 137.1 ± 44.8 g and 99.7 ± 25.4 vs. 75.4 ± 19.9 g/m2, respectively, both P < 0.001. Subclinical leaflet thrombosis (SLT) was detected in 25.6% (30/117) patients. More than 20% reduction in LVM was defined as reverse remodelling and was detected in 62.4% (73/117) of the patients. SLT, change in mean pressure gradient on echocardiography and prior myocardial infarction was independently associated with LV reverse remodelling after adjusting for age, gender, and traditional risk factors (hypertension, body mass index, , and hyperlipidaemia): OR = 0.27, P = 0.022 for SLT and OR = 0.22, P = 0.006 for prior myocardial infarction, OR = 1.51, P = 0.004 for 10 mmHg change in mean pressure gradient. Reverse remodelling was independently associated with favourable outcomes (HR = 0.23; P = 0.019).TAVI resulted in a significant LVM regression on CT. The presence of SLT showed an inverse association with LV reverse remodelling and thus it may hinder the beneficial LV structural changes. Reverse remodelling was associated with improved long-term prognosis.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author(s) 2019.

We obtained data on person- and health-related characteristics at metformin initiation from these collections and calculated medication possession ratios from pharmacy dispensing data. Regression modelling was used to assess changes in adherence over time.We identified 85,066 people with T2DM who initiated metformin monotherapy. Lower adherence to metformin monotherapy was associated with time since initiating metformin, younger age and being of Māori or Pacific ethnicity. Higher adherence was associated with receiving more non-diabetic medications, a history of CVD and recent cancer registration.Our findings are consistent with international literature and highlight groups of people who experience poor adherence over time.

Exclusion criteria included type I  and previous pancreas transplantation. NODAT was defined as a new insulin requirement after KT. Delayed graft function was defined as need for dialysis within the first week after KT. Mean posttransplant follow-up period was 22 months.Forty-one patients underwent KT after LSG after median time of 16 months. Median age of postLSG patients undergoing KT was 56.0 years at time of KT. Average body mass index decreased by 9 from the time of LSG to KT, and no patients regained weight at 1-year follow-up. After LSG, the number of patients with hypertension (85.4% versus 48.5%) and the number of antihypertensive medications used decreased significantly (1.6 versus .6) at time of KT (P < .001 each). At 1-year follow-up, the improvement in hypertension persisted (51.% versus 48.5%, P = nonsignificant). The average insulin regimen decreased from 33.0 ± 51.6 to 11.7 ± 21.5 units at KT (P < .001). This improvement also persisted at 1-year follow-up (11.9 versus 11.7 units, P = nonsignificant). Zero patients suffered NODAT over the follow-up period (versus institutional rate of NODAT at 15.8%). One patient developed delayed graft function (.4%, versus institutional rate of 13.3%). After 1 year postKT, there was 1 graft loss (.4%) and no mortality.This is the largest reported series of KT after planned LSG in morbidly obese patients.

However, the effect of finerenone on CV and renal outcomes has not yet been investigated in long-term trials.The Finerenone in Reducing CV Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD) trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared to placebo at reducing clinically important CV and renal outcomes in T2D patients with CKD. FIGARO-DKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, event-driven trial running in 47 countries with an expected duration of approximately 6 years. FIGARO-DKD randomized 7,437 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 to ≤5,000 mg/g). The study has at least 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the risk of the primary outcome (overall two-sided significance level α = 0.05), the composite of time to first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure.FIGARO-DKD will determine whether an optimally treated cohort of T2D patients with CKD at high risk of CV and renal events will experience cardiorenal benefits with the addition of finerenone to their treatment regimen.EudraCT number: 2015-000950-39; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .© 2019 S.

Although atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP, respectively) produced in the heart control circulatory homeostasis through their common receptor, NPR1, the physiological and pathophysiological roles of endogenous ANP/BNP in the perinatal period are not fully understood.  To clarify the physiological and pathophysiological roles of the endogenous ANP/BNP-NPR1 system during the perinatal period, the phenotype of female wild-type and conventional or tissue-specific Npr1-knockout mice during the perinatal period was examined, especially focusing on maternal heart weight, blood pressure, and cardiac function.  In wild-type mice, lactation but not pregnancy induced reversible cardiac hypertrophy accompanied by increases in fetal cardiac gene mRNAs and ERK1/ phosphorylation. Npr1-knockout mice exhibited significantly higher plasma aldosterone level than did wild-type mice, severe cardiac hypertrophy accompanied by fibrosis, and left ventricular dysfunction in the lactation period. In addition, Npr1-knockout mice showed a high mortality rate over consecutive pregnancy-lactation cycles. In the hearts of Npr1-knockout mice during or after the lactation period, an increase in interleukin-6 mRNA expression, phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and activation of the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells pathway were observed. Pharmacological inhibition of the mineralocorticoid receptor or neuron-specific deletion of the mineralocorticoid receptor gene significantly ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy in lactating Npr1-knockout mice. Anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody administration tended to reduce cardiac hypertrophy in lactating Npr1-knockout mice.  These results suggest that the characteristics of lactation-induced cardiac hypertrophy in wild-type mice are different from exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and that the endogenous ANP/BNP-NPR1 system plays an important role in protecting the maternal heart from interleukin-6-induced inflammation and remodeling in the lactation period, a condition mimicking peripartum cardiomyopathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669041>Modulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide production and activity by taurine and taurine-conjugated bile acids.</a></h2><p>Taurine is a semiessential amino acid found at high concentrations in mammalian plasma and cells, where it regulates cellular functions such as ion flux, controls cell volume and serves as a substrate for conjugated bile acids (BAs). Exogenous administration of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs have also been implicated in the modulation of cardiovascular functions. This brief review summarizes the role of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in vascular relaxation through the modulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). The effects of taurine on vascular health are controversial. However, in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors, it has been proposed that taurine can increase vascular NO levels by increasing eNOS expression, eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177, NO bioavailability, the level of antioxidative defense, and the l-arginine/NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio. The taurine-conjugated BA-mediated activation of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), G protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5) and/or muscarinic 3 receptor (M3) was also reported to increase vascular NO production. FXR activation increases eNOS expression and may reduce ADMA formation, while TGR5 increases mobilization of Ca and phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt in endothelial cells. Furthermore, taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs might regulate NO synthesis and activity by enhancing HS generation. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in reversing the endothelial dysfunction associated with , atherosclerosis, hypertension, obesity, malnutrition, and smoking. In addition, taurine-conjugated BAs have emerged as a potential treatment for portal hypertension. Despite these favorable findings, there is a need to further explore the mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the endothelial effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs. Here, we summarize the main findings regarding the effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs on the endothelial dysfunction associated with altered NO metabolism in cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Since alteration in total and regional brain volumes are consistent findings among T2D individuals, we studied the association of four T2D susceptibility SNPS within TCF7L2 (rs7901695, rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs12255372) with volumes of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), gray matter, and regional volumes of amygdala and hippocampus obtained from structural MRI among 191 T2D elderly Jewish individuals. Under recessive genetic model (controlling for age, sex and intracranial volume), we found that for all four SNPs, carriers of two copies of the T2D risk allele (homozygous genotype) had significantly smaller amygdalar volume: rs7901695- CC genotype vs. CT + TT genotypes, p = 0.002; rs7903146-TT vs. TC + CC, p = 0.003; rs11196205- CC vs. CG + GG, p = 0.0003; and rs12255372- TT vs. TG + GG, p = 0.003. Adjusting also for T2D-related covariates, body mass index (BMI), and ancestry did not change the results substantively (rs7901695, p = 0.003; rs7903146, p = 0.005; rs11196205, p = 0.001; and rs12255372, p = 0.005). Conditional analysis demonstrated that only rs11196205 was independently associated with amygdalar volume at a significant level. Separate analysis of left and right amygdala revealed stronger results for left amygdalar volume. Taken together, we report association of TCF7L2 SNPs with amygdalar volume among T2D elderly Jewish patients.

In addition, although micro-TESE (mTESE) has been advocated as the gold standard for sperm retrieval in men with NOA, its superiority over conventional TESE (cTESE) remains conflicting.The objective was to perform a meta-analysis of the currently available studies comparing the techniques of sperm retrieval and to identify clinical and biochemical factors predicting SRR in men with NOA. In addition, PRs and live birth rates (LBRs), as derived from subjects with NOA post-ICSI, were also analysed as secondary outcomes.An extensive Medline, Embase and Cochrane search was performed. All trials reporting SRR derived from cTESE or mTESE in patients with NOA and their specific determinants were included. Data derived from genetic causes of NOA or testicular sperm aspiration were excluded.Out of 1236 studies, 117 studies met the inclusion criteria for this study, enrolling 21 404 patients with a mean age (± SD) of 35.0 ± .7 years. cTESE and mTESE were used in 56 and 43 studies, respectively. In addition, 10 studies used a mixed approach and 8 studies compared cTESE with mTESE approach. Overall, a SRR per TESE procedure of 47[45;49]% (mean percentage [95% CI]) was found. No differences were observed when mTESE was compared to cTESE (46[43;49]% for cTESE versus 46[42;49]% for mTESE). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that SRR per cycle was independent of age and hormonal parameters at enrolment. However, the SRR increased as a function of testis volume. In particular, by applying ROC curve analysis, a mean testis volume higher than 12.5 ml predicted SRR >60% with an accuracy of 86.% ± 0.01. In addition, SRR decreased as a function of the number of Klinefelter's syndrome cases included (S = -0.02[-0.04;-0.01]; P < 0.01. I = 0.12[-0.05;0.29]; P = 0.16). Information on fertility outcomes after ICSI was available in 42 studies. Overall, a total of 1096 biochemical pregnancies were reported (cumulative PR = 29[25;32]% per ICSI cycle). A similar rate was observed when LBR was analysed (569 live births with a cumulative LBR = 24[20;28]% per ICSI cycle). No influence of male and female age, mean testis volume or hormonal parameters on both PR and LBR per ICSI cycle was observed. Finally, a higher PR per ICSI cycle was observed when the use of fresh sperm was compared to cryopreserved sperm (PR = 35[30;40]%, versus 20[13;29]% respectively): however, this result was not confirmed when cumulative LBR per ICSI cycle was analysed (LBR = 30[20;41]% for fresh versus 20[12;31]% for cryopreserved sperm).This analysis shows that cTESE/mTESE in subjects with NOA results in SRRs of up to 50%, with no differences when cTESE was compared to mTESE. Retrieved sperms resulted in a LBR of up to 28% ICSI cycle. Although no difference between techniques was found, to conclusively clarify if one technique is superior to the other, there is a need for a sufficiently powered and well-designed randomized controlled trial to compare mTESE to cTESE in men with NOA.© The Author(s) 2019.

Since observational studies indicated that SGTF may also increase symptoms of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the CATS cohort was used to investigate whether treatment of mothers affected their children's behavior.Mothers (N=475) completed 3 questionnaires, strengths and difficulties (SDQ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and social communication (SCQ, used as a screen for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)), about their children (aged 9.5 years). Group comparisons of total scores, numbers of children above clinical thresholds and association between high maternal FT4 (>97.5th percentile of the UK cohort, 'over-treated') and child neurodevelopment were reported.There were no differences in total scores between normal-GTF (n=246), treated (n=125) and untreated (n=104) SGTF groups. More children of treated mothers scored above clinical thresholds, particularly the over-treated. Scores were above thresholds in SDQ conduct 22% vs 7%, SCQ total scores 7% vs 1%, and ADHD hyperactivity 17% vs 5% when comparing over-treated (n=40) and untreated (N=100) respectively. We identified significantly higher mean scores for SDQ conduct (adjusted mean difference (AMD) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.021 to 1.431, P=0.040, effect size 0.018) and ADHD hyperactivity (AMD 1.60, CI 0.361 to .633, P=0.003, effect size 0.028) comparing over-treated with normal-GTF children.There was no overall association between SGTF and offspring ADHD, ASD or behavior questionnaire scores. However, children of 'over-treated' mothers displayed significantly more ADHD symptoms and behavioral difficulties than normal-GTF. Thyroxine supplementation during pregnancy requires monitoring to avoid over-treatment.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

Our aim was to
obtain updated information about characteristics of stroke patients and management of stroke across the Ibero-American countries, using a common in-hospital registry (Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke–Sociedad Iberoamericana de Enfermedades Cerebrovasculares) as a basis for further quality improvement.Data for this study were entered into the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke registry from September
2009 to December 2013 by 58 centers in 14 countries. Data included demographics, risk factors, onset-to-door time, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, stroke subtype, ischemic stroke etiology, treatments, 3-month mortality, and modified Rankin Scale score. Time to treatment was also recorded for patients treated with thrombolysis.Five thousand four hundred one patients were registered; median age, 65 years; 46% women; 3915 (72.5%)
ischemic strokes; 686 (13.7%) hemorrhagic strokes; 213 (4.3%) subarachnoid hemorrhages; 414 (8.3%) transient ischemic attacks; and 31 (0.6%) cerebral vein thrombosis. The most prevalent risk factors were hypertension (71.3%), dyslipidemia (35.%), and  (23.6%). Atrial fibrillation was present in 15.1%. Three hundred one ischemic strokes were treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT; 7.7%). Patients undergoing IVT were more severely affected (median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 11 versus 6). The rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages after IVT was 5.7%. At 3 months, 60.3% of IVT-treated patients and 59.1% of untreated patients were independent (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–).

In this study, it was aimed to select the best incision management system to keep the incision edges together and prevent wound opening, and infection by protecting the incision. In this study, 60 patients who underwent abdominal surgery were evaluated regarding their risk of wound dehiscence. In our clinic, high-risk cases of abdominal surgery are performed, the risk factors being ischemia along the incision line, dirty and contaminated wound, obesity, tension on the suture line, traumatization of the wound site, age at onset (> 65), body mass index (BMI) > 30, , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), immunosuppressive drug users. A prospective study protocol was planned after ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status class assignment. Patients were divided into three groups: patients who underwent a postoperative negative-pressure therapy dressing, patients who underwent subcutaneous aspiration drainage, and patients who received standard dressing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the decompensation, surgical site infection, seroma, hospital stay and costs and to evaluate the results in the postoperative period. Sixty patients were randomized (n = 20, for each group). Thirty-one (51%) of the patients were male, and the mean age was 64.3 ± 8.9 (46-85). The mean BMI was 30.45 ± 7.. There was no statistically significant difference (p≥0.05) between groups in terms of sex, age, and BMI. The ASA score and surgical interventions were similar between the groups. Wound dehiscence rate was 25% (n = 8), 20% (n = 6) and 3% (n = 1) for the Standard Dressing (SD), Aspiration Drainage (AD) and Negative-Pressure (NP) groups, respectively (p <0.017). Duration of hospitalization was 16.45 ± 6.6, 14.3 ± 7.4 and 8.95 ± .8 days (p <0.001) for SD, AD and NP groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups regarding other variables (p≥0.05 for all variables). Negative-pressure wound treatment is an easy, fast and practical technique which reduces lateral tension and swelling. It provides perfusion support and helps to protect the surgical field against external sources of infection.©Carol Davila University Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676389>Carnitine supplementation improves metabolic flexibility and skeletal muscle acetylcarnitine formation in volunteers with impaired glucose tolerance: A randomised controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Type   patients and individuals at risk of developing  are characterized by metabolic inflexibility and disturbed glucose homeostasis. Low carnitine availability may contribute to metabolic inflexibility and impaired glucose tolerance. Here, we investigated whether carnitine supplementation improves metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity in impaired glucose tolerant (IGT) volunteers.Eleven IGT- volunteers followed a 36-day placebo- and L-carnitine treatment ( g/day) in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind crossover design. A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (40 mU/m/min), combined with indirect calorimetry (ventilated hood) was performed to determine insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility. Furthermore, metabolic flexibility was assessed in response to a high-energy meal. Skeletal muscle acetylcarnitine concentrations were measured in vivo using long echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS, TE=500 ms) in the resting state (7:00AM and 5:00PM) and after a 30-min cycling exercise. Twelve normal glucose tolerant (NGT) volunteers were included without any intervention as control group.Metabolic flexibility of IGT-subjects completely restored towards NGT control values upon carnitine supplementation, measured during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and meal test. In muscle, carnitine supplementation enhanced the increase in resting acetylcarnitine concentrations over the day (delta 7:00 AM versus 5:00 PM) in IGT-subjects. Furthermore, carnitine supplementation increased post-exercise acetylcarnitine concentrations and reduced long-chain acylcarnitine species in IGT-subjects, suggesting the stimulation of a more complete fat oxidation in muscle. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was not affected.Carnitine supplementation improves acetylcarnitine formation and rescues metabolic flexibility in IGT-subjects.

Since the beginning of the 1990s, several telemedicine projects and studies focused on type 1 and type  . Over the last 5 years, numerous telemedicine projects based on connected objects and new information and communication technologies (ICT) (elements defining telemedicine .0) have emerged or are still under development. Two examples are the DIABETe and Telesage telemonitoring project which perfectly fits within the telemedicine .0 framework - the first to include artificial intelligence (AI) with MyPredi and Diabeo. Mainly, these projects and studies show that telemonitoring diabetic result in: improvements in control of blood glucose (BG) level and significant reduction in HbA1c (e.g., for Telescot et TELESAGE studies); positive impact on co-morbidities (arterial hypertension, weight, dyslipidemia) (e.g., for Telescot and DIABETe studies); better patient's quality of life (e.g., for DIABETe study); positive impact on appropriation of the disease by patients and/or greater adherence to therapeutic and hygiene-dietary measures (e.g., The Utah Remote Monitoring Project); and at least, good receptiveness by patients and their empowerment. To date, the magnitude of its effects remains debatable, especially with the variation in patients' characteristics (e.g., background, ability for self-management, medical condition), samples selection and approach for the treatment of control groups.

The Afirma Gene Sequencing Classifier (GSC) was developed to improve the specificity of the Gene Expression Classifier (GEC). Independent studies are needed to assess the performance of GSC.The aim was to compare the performance of GEC and GSC in the assessment of indeterminate nodules.Retrospective analysis of Bethesda III and IV nodules tested with GEC or GSC in an academic center between December 2011 and September 2018. Benign call rates (BCR) and surgical outcomes were compared. Histopathologic data were collected on nodules that were surgically resected to calculate measures of test performance.The BCR was 41% (73/178) for GEC and 67.8% (82/121) for GSC (p<0.001). Among specimens with dominant Hürthle cell cytology, the BCR was 22% (6/27) for GEC and 63.% (12/19) for GSC (p=0.005). The overall surgery rate decreased from 47.8% in the GEC group to 34.7% in the GSC group (p=0.025). One GEC-benign and three GSC-benign nodules proved to be malignant in surgical excision. GSC had a statistically significant higher specificity (94% vs 60%, p<0.001) and positive predictive value (PPV) (85.3% vs 40%, p<0.001) compared to GEC. While sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) dropped with GSC (97.0% vs 90.6% and 98.6% vs 96.3%, respectively), these differences were not significantly different.GSC reclassified more indeterminate nodules as benign and improved the specificity and PPV of the test. These enhancements appear to be resulting in fewer diagnostic surgeries.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

Hierarchical regression models predicted four postoperative geriatric outcomes (i.e. pressure ulcer, delirium, new mobility aid use, and functional decline) using the traditional 21-variable ACS NSQIP SRC models and 27-variable models that included six geriatric risk factors (i.e. living situation, fall history, mobility aid use, cognitive impairment, surrogate-signed consent, and palliative care on admission).Data from 38,048 patients ages ≥ 65 undergoing 197 unique operations across 10 surgical subspecialties were used. Stable model discrimination and calibration between developmental and validation datasets confirmed predictive validity. Models with and without geriatric risk factors demonstrated excellent performance (c-statistics > 0.8) with inclusion of geriatric risk factors improving performance. Of the 21 ACS NSQIP variables, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), age, functional dependence, sex, disseminated cancer, , and sepsis were the strongest risk predictors, while impaired cognition, fall history, and mobility aid use were the strongest geriatric predictors.The ACS NSQIP SRC can predict four unique outcomes germane to geriatric surgical patients, with improvement of predictive capability after accounting for geriatric risk factors.

Androgen is suggested not only to regulate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis but also to affect metabolism. In this study, Glp1r mRNA was found widely expressed in normal male mice and its levels were positively correlated with the serum testosterone (T) concentrations. Using mouse insulinoma 6 (MIN6) cells, which highly express GLP-1R, we observed GLP-1R was upregulated both at transcriptional and protein levels induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and was downregulated by androgen receptor inhibitor ARN-509 or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Glp1r mRNA. In normal C57BL/6 mice and db/db mice, Glp1r mRNA levels in the pancreases increased in the DHT treatment group and decreased in the ARN-509 treatment group. And the increased GLP-1R expression had insulinotropic function both in vitro and in vivo. Further analysis showed that the androgen receptor (Ar) located in the cytosol of MIN6 cells and translocated to the nucleus after DHT treatment. In addition, we found that there was an Ar motif in the promoter region of the Glp1r gene. Further studies revealed that the translocated DHT/Ar complex from the cytosol to the nucleus bound to the Ar motif of the Glp1r gene and upregulated gene transcription. Taken together, the widely expressed GLP-1R was positively regulated by androgen under physiological condition and in diabetic models at the transcriptional level.Copyright © 2019.

To facilitate the early diagnosis of SFN, biomarkers for SFN must be identified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of SFN in prediabetic patients and the relationship between pNF-H and SFN.44 IGT patients (inpatients and outpatients) were selected at random. 33 healthy subjects served as controls. Data on clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters were collected. Quantitative sensory testing (QST), electromyography (EMG), and Sudoscan were performed, and pNF-H was measured by ELISA.24 of the 44 patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were diagnosed with SFN according to the modified Toronto Diabetic Neuropathy Expert Group consensus criteria. The thermal sensory thresholds of the IGT-SFN group were significantly different from those of the CTRL group (p < 0.05), except for the heat pain threshold. The sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) of the sural nerve was 12.39 in the IGT-SFN group, which was significantly lower than those in the other groups. No significant difference in nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was observed among the three groups. The electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) in the IGT-SFN group was 69.78 ± 14.03uS, which was significantly lower than that in the CTRL group. The pNF-H in the IGT-SFN group was 170.6 (140.0, 223.6) pg/ml, which was significantly higher than those in the CTRL and IGT-non-SFN groups (76.55 and 64.7 pg/ml, respectively). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that pNF-H and 2h plasma glucose were independently correlated with SFN; the ORs (95% CI) were 1.429 (1.315, 1.924) and .375 (1.157, 4.837), respectively.Serum pNF-H may be associated with SFN in IGT patients, and serum pNF-H could therefore serve as a sensitive biomarker for the detection of SFN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671800>The Usefulness of Anthropometric Indices to Identify the Risk of Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Despite several papers having been published on the association between adiposity and the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), it is still difficult to determine unambiguously which of the indices of nutritional status is the best to identify MetS. The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of six anthropometric indices to identify MetS in the Polish population. The highest odds ratios for the occurrence of MetS, according to International  Federation (IDF), were noted for the following indices: waist-to-height ratio (WHtR, OR = 24.87) and Clínica Universidad de Navarra-body adiposity estimator (CUN-BAE, OR = 17.47) in men and WHtR (OR = 25.61) and body roundness index (BRI, OR = 16.44) in women. The highest odds ratios for the modified definition of MetS (without waist circumference) were found for the following indices: WHtR (OR = 7.32), BRI (OR = 6.57), and CUN-BAE (OR = 6.12) in women and CUN-BAE (OR = 5.83), WHtR (OR = 5.70), and body mass index (BMI, OR = 5.65) in men ( < 0.001 for all). According to the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses conducted for the identification of MetS, defined in accordance with IDF, the largest areas under the curve (AUCs) in men were observed for WHtR and CUN-BAE indices, whereas in women, they were observed for WHtR and BRI. In the analysis carried out for the identification of MetS (according to modified definition, without waist circumference), the AUCs were larger for WHtR and BRI in women, while in men, they were larger for CUN-BAE, BMI, and WHtR. BMI was also characterized by a relatively strong discriminatory power in identifying individuals with MetS. An optimal cut-off point for MetS, in accordance with the conventional definition, for both sexes was the value of BMI = 27. kg/m. The weakest predictor of the syndrome was the ABSI (a body shape index) indicator. The most useful anthropometric indicator for the identification of MetS, both in men and in women in the Polish population, was WHtR.

PROK2 is also expressed in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) as an essential factor for neuro-and morphogenesis. Since the MOB was shown to be strongly involved in eating behavior, we hypothesized that PROK2 could be a new target in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis, through its effects in the MOB. We also asked whether PROK2 could be associated with the pathophysiology of obesity, the metabolic syndrome (MetS), and type   (T2D) in humans.We assessed in wild type mice whether the expression of Prok2 in the MOB is dependent on the nutritional status. We measured the effect of human recombinant PROK2 (rPROK2) acute injection in the MOB on food intake and olfactory behavior. Then, using a lentivirus expressing Prok2-shRNA, we studied the effects of Prok2 underexpression in the MOB on feeding behavior and glucose metabolism. Metabolic parameters and meal pattern were determined using calorimetric cages. In vivo -deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed in mice after intraperitoneally insulin injection. Plasmatic PROK2 dosages and genetic associations studies were carried out respectively on 148 and more than 4000 participants from the D.E.S.I.R. (Data from an Epidemiologic Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome) cohort.Our findings showed that fasting in mice reduced Prok2 expression in the MOB. Acute injection of rPROK2 in the MOB significantly decreased food intake whereas Prok2-shRNA injection resulted in a higher dietary consumption characterized by increased feeding frequency and decreased meal size. Additionally, Prok2 underexpression in the MOB induced insulin resistance compared to scrambled shRNA-injected mice. In the human D.E.S.I.R. cohort, we found a significantly lower mean concentration of plasma PROK2 in people with T2D than in those with normoglycemia. Interestingly, this decrease was no longer significant when adjusted for Body Mass Index (BMI) or calorie intake, suggesting that the association between plasma PROK2 and  is mediated, at least partly, by BMI and feeding behavior in humans. Moreover, common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in PROK2 gene were genotyped and associated with incident T2D or impaired fasting glycemia (IFG), MetS, and obesity.Our data highlight PROK2 as a new target in the MOB that links olfaction with eating behavior and energy homeostasis. In humans, plasma PROK2 is negatively correlated with T2D, BMI, and energy intake, and PROK2 genetic variants are associated with incident hyperglycemia (T2D/IFG), the MetS and obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD, and especially NASH, are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Type   (T2DM) predisposes to NAFLD development and progression via insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter  inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed. Taking into consideration the global increasing prevalence of NAFLD/NASH, therapeutic options that can prevent or treat this disease will exert considerable benefits on human health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Pin1 interacts with the motif containing phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro of substrates and enhances cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds, thereby controlling the functions of these substrates. Importantly, the Pin1 expression level is highly upregulated in most cancer cells and correlates with malignant properties, and thereby with poor outcomes. In addition, Pin1 was revealed to promote the functions of multiple oncogenes and to abrogate tumor suppressors. Accordingly, Pin1 is well recognized as a master regulator of malignant processes. Recent studies have shown that Pin1 also binds to a variety of metabolic regulators, such as AMP-activated protein kinase, acetyl CoA carboxylase and pyruvate kinase2, indicating Pin1 to have major impacts on lipid and glucose metabolism in cancer cells. In this review, we focus on the roles of Pin1 in metabolic reprogramming, such as "Warburg effects", of cancer cells. Our aim is to introduce these important roles of Pin1, as well as to present evidence supporting the possibility of Pin1 inhibition as a novel anti-cancer strategy.Copyright © 2019.

Daily glucose variability was evaluated by mean amplitude of glycemic excursions [MAGE], percentage coefficient of variation for glucose (%CV), and day-to-day glucose variability (mean of daily differences [MODD]) by using continuous glucose monitoring. Correlations of clinical factors, including insulin secretion ability by the GST with MAGE, %CV, and MODD, were analyzed.In 83 T2DM with insulin therapy, age and hemoglobin A (HbA) correlated with MAGE and %CV, fasting plasma glucose with MAGE and MODD, and increment of C-peptide immunoreactivity (ΔCPR) by GST correlated inversely with MAGE, %CV, and MODD. In 126 T2DM without insulin therapy, age, diastolic blood pressure, and triglycerides correlated with MODD, HbA with MAGE and MODD, and ΔCPR inversely correlated with %CV. Use of α-glucosidase inhibitors inversely correlated with %CV, whereas that of sulfonylurea was associated with MAGE and %CV.These results suggest that ΔCPR correlated with stability of glycemic control, whereas poorly controlled  is associated with increase in glucose variability. α-glucosidase inhibitors may be superior to sulfonylureas in reducing the glucose variability in T2DM.Copyright © 2019.

Participants filled out questionnaires on psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for 5 consecutive days. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of covariance in SPSS.Educational level significantly influenced the association between perception of body weight and light PA (P = .01) and total PA (P = .03) on weekend days. Educational level did not influence the associations between other psychosocial and perceived environmental factors (ie, perceived social influence; environmental, time and attitudinal barriers, perceived self-efficacy; knowledge and fatalism) and PA.Educational level did not influence the relationship between most psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and PA in this sample of adults at type   risk. This suggests that addressing different psychosocial and perceived environmental correlates in lower and higher educated participants might not be necessary.

However, to date, no studies have directly compared the effects of these two drugs on the components of the metabolic syndrome in patients with type   (T2DM).The Comparison of Canagliflozin vs. Teneligliptin against Basic Metabolic Risks in Patients with T2DM (CANTABILE) study aims to examine whether the DPP-4 inhibitor (teneligliptin) or the SGLT2 inhibitor (canagliflozin) is the more effective drug for reducing metabolic risk factors as a composite in Japanese patients with T2DM.The CANTABILE study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group comparison study. A total of 200 patients with T2DM treated with metformin alone or without glucose-lowering agents will be enrolled if they have one or more of the metabolic risk factors, such as obesity, borderline high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia. They will then will be randomized into the Teneligliptin group or the Canagliflozin group and treated for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the composite ratio of subjects with one or more improved metabolic risk factors. The secondary endpoints are the changes in each component of the primary endpoint.The CANTABILE study provides valuable evidence to indicate the suitability of SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors for Japanese patients with T2DM and metabolic risks.University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry number: UMIN000030343.Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679657></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665267>Cost-utility analysis of lifestyle interventions to prevent type   in women with prior gestational .</a></h2><p>To compare estimated costs and health outcomes of lifestyle interventions for the prevention of type   in women who had gestational .An age-specific Markov model was applied comparing costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of three alternatives: 'doing nothing'; an annual reminder system (ARS) with an awareness campaign ('ARS-awareness'); and an ARS with an intensive lifestyle intervention ('ARS-ILS'). A healthcare payer perspective was adopted, the time horizon was 30 years and the setting was Flanders (Belgium). Sensitivity analyses were performed.'ARS-awareness' was extendedly dominated. Per 10 000 participants, 'ARS-ILS' cost €13 210 256 more and gained 496 QALYs compared with 'doing nothing' (26 632 €/QALY), with a 63% probability of being cost effective, given a cost effectiveness threshold of 35 000 €/QALY. A scenario analysis showed that 'ARS-ILS' for 15 years only offered to women with prediabetes (compared with 'doing nothing') has an 89.5% likelihood of being dominant.'ARS-ILS' may be the preferred intervention. However, the probability of being cost effective was low. Based on further scenario analyses, we recommend healthcare decision makers to consider the application of a more intensive alternative, focused on the highest risk profiles and with a shorter intervention duration.© The Author(s) 2019.

This secondary, pooled analysis of data from the DEVOTE trial examined whether baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) categories were associated with a higher risk of these outcomes.DEVOTE was a treat-to-target, double-blind trial involving 7637 patients with T2D at high CV risk who were randomized to once-daily treatment with either insulin degludec (degludec) or insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine U100). Patients with estimated GFR data at baseline (n = 7522) were analyzed following stratification into four GFR categories.The risks of MACE, CV death, and all-cause mortality increased with worsening baseline GFR category (P < 0.05), with a trend towards higher rates of severe hypoglycemia. Patients with prior CVD, CKD (estimated GFR < 60 mL/min/m), or both were at higher risk of MACE, CV death, and all-cause mortality. Only CKD was associated with a higher rate of severe hypoglycemia, and the risk of MACE was higher in patients with CVD than in those with CKD (P  = 0.0003). There were no significant interactions between randomized treatment and GFR category.The risks of MACE, CV death, and all-cause mortality were higher with lower baseline GFR and with prior CVD, CKD, or both. The relative effects of degludec versus glargine U100 on outcomes were consistent across baseline GFR categories, suggesting that the lower rate of severe hypoglycemia associated with degludec use versus glargine U100 use was independent of baseline GFR category.Novo Nordisk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680189></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669065>Advances in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.</a></h2><p>As the  epidemic in the United States continues to worsen, so too does the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR is divided broadly into nonproliferative and proliferative stages, with or without vision-threatening macular edema. Progression to proliferative DR is associated with vision loss that is often irreparable, and a rapid decline in health-related quality of life. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is upregulated in the diabetic eye, and has been identified as a key driver of DR pathogenesis. With this perspective, we review the published phase III clinical trial data of anti-VEGF therapies approved for the treatment of DR in the United States. Using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale, in which an improvement of ≥ steps is considered clinically significant, approximately one-third of patients with DR and macular edema experience this level of improvement after 1 year of treatment with either ranibizumab or aflibercept. The rates of clinically significant DR improvement with ranibizumab could be twice that in the subgroup of patients with moderately severe or severe nonproliferative DR and macular edema. These clinical trial data indicate that intraocular inhibition of VEGF is a rational approach for the management of DR.Copyright © 2019.

It has been noted that nearly 50% of all patients undergo the systemic treatment module; however, most of them exhibit drug resistance. In addition, targeted gene therapy has also been used in treatment but has been found to be effective only in patients with a specified molecular profile (or else this might lead to an increased risk of developing resistant mutations). This has led to increasing interest among researchers in finding innovative treatment options. Metformin, a biguanide, has been widely used in treating . The drug has been reportedly used in cases of hypothesis-generating retrospective population studies of diabetic patients showing reduced incidence of cancer.

We assessed the utility of these urine steroid profiles in detecting ACC recurrence, either when interpreted by expert clinicians, or when analyzed by Random Forest, a machine learning-based classifier. Radiological recurrence detection served as the reference standard.Imaging detected recurrent disease in 42 of 135 patients; 32 had provided pre- and post-recurrence urine samples. 39 patients remained disease-free for ≥3 years. The urine "steroid fingerprint" at recurrence resembled that observed before R0 resection in the majority of cases. Review of longitudinally collected urine steroid profiles by three blinded experts detected recurrence by the time of radiological diagnosis in 50-72% of cases, improving to 69-92%, if a pre-operative urine steroid result was available. Recurrence detection by steroid profiling preceded detection by imaging by more than  months in 22-39% of patients. Specificities varied considerably, ranging from 61 to 97%. The computational classifier detected ACC recurrence with superior accuracy (sensitivity=specificity=81%).Urine steroid metabolomics is a promising tool for post-operative recurrence detection in ACC; availability of a pre-operative urine considerably improves the ability to detect ACC recurrence.© Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670905>Methylphenidate in children with monogenic obesity due to LEPR or MC4R deficiency improves feeling of satiety and reduces BMI-SDS-A case series.</a></h2><p>The clinical phenotype of patients with monogenic obesity due to mutations in the leptin receptor (LEPR) or melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene is characterized by impaired satiety and hyperphagia, leading to extreme, sometimes life-threatening weight gain.In a case series, we analysed the effect of an off-label methylphenidate (MPH) use for 1 year as an individual treatment approach on eating behaviour (Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire [CEBQ]), appetite (visual analogue scales) and body mass index (BMI) trajectories in five patients with severe obesity due to mutations in the LEPR (n = 3) or MC4R (n = ) gene.After 1 year use of MPH (20 mg/day divided in two to three doses), BMI (Δ BMI  : -0.7 ± 0.9 kg/m ), BMI standard deviation score (SDS) (Δ BMI-SDS  : -0.32 ± 0.20), and %BMIP95 (Δ %BMIP95  : -6.6 ± 7.8%) decreased. BMI-SDS velocity decreased from +0.17 ± 0.22 to -0.30 ± 0.20. Appetite and CEBQ subscale scores for "food responsiveness" and "enjoyment of food" decreased. We observed adverse effects with increase in self-reported frequency of disordered sleep, nervousness, hyperactivity, and tics.The observed decrease in BMI trajectories with MPH use for one year is clinically meaningful in this group of patients, since the natural course would have been associated with a pronounced increase in BMI, leading to comorbidities and complications over time.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this review was to summarize information on the association between dietary habits and the risk of developing T2D.We conducted a comprehensive literature search using the PubMed database from its inception to June, 2019. Articles were restricted to those written in English and concerning human subjects. Relevant manuscripts found in the list of references of the retrieved articles were also used in preparation for the review.Animal protein consumption increases the risk of T2D independently of body mass index. Intake of both unprocessed meat and processed meat is strongly and consistently associated with increased risk of developing T2D. In contrast, consumption of high-quality vegetable foods prevents the disease. High-quality plant foods include whole grains, nuts, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Among less healthy plant-based foods are fruit juices, sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes, sweets, and desserts. Carbohydrate-restricted diets that encourage consumption of animal products promote T2D. Low intake of animal products is linked to high educational level so that well-informed individuals tend to consume diets with elevated content of vegetable food. According to the American Dietetic Association, "appropriately planned vegetarian diets including vegan diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases".restricting animal products while increasing healthy plant-based foods intake facilitates T2D prevention. To neutralize worldwide the burden of T2D and its devastating complications, animal products consumption should be limited or discontinued.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

We aimed to examine the prospective association of alcohol consumption with echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function, in individuals with and without type   (T2DM).We included 778 participants from the Hoorn Study (aged 68.4 ± 7. years, 49% women), a population-based prospective cohort study, oversampled for people with impaired glucose metabolism or T2DM. Self-reported alcohol consumption was collected at baseline with a validated food-frequency questionnaire and categorized into: none (0/week), light (>0-≤30 g/week), light-to-moderate (>30-≤70 g/week), moderate (>70-≤140 g/week), and heavy drinkers (>140 g/week). Echocardiography was performed at baseline (N = 778) and after 8 years follow-up (N = 404). Multiple linear regression was used to study the association between alcohol consumption and echocardiographic measures (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial volume index (LAVI) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI)), adjusted for confounders. Moderate and heavy alcohol consumption were associated with a decreased LVEF of -3.91% (CI: -7.13;-0.69) for moderate and -4.77% (-8.18;-1.36) for heavy drinkers compared to light drinkers. No associations were found between alcohol consumption, LVMI and LAVI. Modified Poisson regression showed a trend that higher alcohol consumption amounts were associated with a higher risk of incident systolic dysfunction (LVEF≤50%) (P-for-trend 0.058).The findings provide longitudinal evidence that moderate and heavy alcohol consumption are associated with decreased LVEF and trend towards a higher risk of incident LV systolic dysfunction, compared to light drinkers.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

In resource limited TB endemic settings, cure is declared through sputum smear examination for acid fast bacilli without performing culture. This may lead to erroneous treatment outcomes as viable bacteria may be missed due to the low sensitivity of direct smear method. The aim of this study was to investigate if sterilizing cure is achieved among the new pulmonary TB cases declared cured by sputum smear conversion and to evaluate the impact of addition of ethambutol in the continuation phase in achieving it.New sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB patients registered at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan from November 2013 to March 2014 were followed under standard Directly Observed Treatment Short Course strategy for 6 months. Half of these patients received ethambutol in addition to isoniazid and rifampicin in the continuation phase. Sputum specimens were examined on microscopy at  months and at the end of treatment. Sputa of patients with negative direct smear examination at the end of treatment were cultured.Among 5746 TB suspects, 1595 were new sputum smear positive pulmonary TB cases, and 533 were registered at our hospital. Among these, 504 converted sputum negative at  months and 348 converted at the end of 6 months of treatment and were declared cured. Sputa of 204/348 patients were cultured, and 12/204 (6%) were culture-positive. Culture positivity at 6 months was not associated with bacterial load, smoking, , presence of cavities, history of contact with TB patients, age, sex, socioeconomic status, or addition of ethambutol in the continuation phase.Viable cultivable bacilli were detected in 6% of cured patients, which would have significant impact on the control of TB. This highlights the need for an inexpensive and accurate surrogate marker for culture as it is not feasible to perform culture in routine for monitoring treatment response in the low-resource settings. The treatment outcome did not improve by addition of ethambutol emphasizing the need to find the optimal duration of treatment for individual or carefully selected groups of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679667></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668742>Comparison of 1-field, -fields, and 3-fields fundus photography for detection and grading of diabetic retinopathy.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 1-, -, and 3-fields, nonmydriatic (NM), 45° color photography compared with mydriatic ophthalmoscopy for detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR).Masked, comparative case series was performed utilizing a group of 128 diabetic patients (256 eyes) with various stages of DR who underwent both 3-fields NM color photography and ophthalmologic examination.

This research presents the first use of a patient-reported outcome measure designed to assess patient-perceived benefits and disadvantages of drugs received during clinical studies.The Patient's Qualitative Assessment of Treatment (PQAT) was developed in English and cognitively tested with US (n = 4) and Canadian (n = 3) patients with type 1 and type   (T2DM). The revised version of the PQAT comprises three qualitative open-ended questions focused on the benefits and disadvantages of treatment and reasons why patients would choose to continue/discontinue treatment. A final quantitative question asks patients to evaluate the balance between benefits and disadvantages using a 7-point scale. The revised version of the questionnaire was administered as an exploratory endpoint in a phase II clinical trial for a new injectable treatment for T2DM. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis, and relationships between qualitative and quantitative data were identified.Patient-reported benefits of treatment administered during the clinical trial included clinical markers of efficacy and subjective markers. Disadvantages reported by patients were mainly related to drug adverse effects or to the mode of administration. Of the 57 patients completing the PQAT, 70.% reported being willing to continue treatment, with 59.6% reporting that the benefits outweighed the disadvantages. The reported benefits of feeling better and improved energy levels were more likely to be associated with a more positive ratio (70% and 71.4%, respectively), while the disadvantages of fatigue, headaches, and stomach pain were associated with a negative ratio and patients not being willing to continue the treatment.The PQAT is a unique patient-reported outcome tool designed to aid understanding patients' real experience of benefits and disadvantages of a treatment. It combines the richness of qualitative data with quantitative data-information valuable for various stakeholders to make well-informed treatment decisions.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679659></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671205>Trends and predictors of gestational  in Chile.</a></h2><p>To examine the temporal trends in gestational  (GDM) prevalence in Chile, and to determine the main predictors of GDM.A secondary analysis was conducted of all birth records at Hospital Dr. Sótero del Río, Chile, from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2015.

Percentage of Snail-positive cells in control groups was high and decreased with time, whereas in DM groups the highest percentage was after  weeks. In all time points, smaller percentage of Snail expression was seen in DM groups compared to controls. SRF expression was mostly located in the proximal convoluted tubules, always in the cytoplasm. In control groups SRF was expressed in all time periods in proximal convoluted tubules, with decrement after 12 months. Percentage of SRF-positive cells was higher in control groups compared to DM in all time points, with the exception of 12 months. To a smaller degree, SRF expression was seen in the glomeruli and distal convoluted tubules, with more SRF positive cells in DM compared to their control groups.While Snail expression remained lower in diabetic tissues, compared to controls, expression of SRF increased in diabetic tissues in the second part of the year. These changes may need long time to develop, and, in line with earlier reports, it is possible that insulin treatment of DM rats once a week reduces possibility of EMT and development of renal fibrosis even in the long term.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

We previously reported that cognitive impairment is exacerbated in KKAy mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia (IH), during which the DNA binding protein HMGB1 mediates hippocampal neuronal apoptosis by maintaining microglia-associated neuroinflammation, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown.We performed immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry experiments in mouse hippocampal tissues and HT22 cells. KKAy type   model mice and normal C57BL/6J mice were exposed to IH or intermittent normoxia. HT22 cells were cultured in high glucose medium and exposed to IH or intermittent normoxia. We transfected HMGB1 siRNA into HT22 cells and then treated them with high glucose combined with intermittent hypoxia.In conclusion, IH aggravated apoptosis and autophagy defects in T2DM mice, and increased the protein expression of HMGB1 and TLR4. This was also confirmed in HG +IH-treated hippocampal HT22 cells. HMGB1 siRNA can significantly reduce the protein expression of HMGB1 and TLR4, reverse neuronal apoptosis and enhance autophagy.We believe that HMGB1 is a key factor in the regulation of hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and autophagy defects in T2DM combined with OSA. Targeting HMGB1/TLR4 signaling as a novel approach may delay or prevent the increased apoptosis and decreased autophagy induced by T2DM combined with OSA, and may ultimately improve cognitive dysfunction.Copyright © 2019.

Past research suggests gender differences in adherence, DD, and DS. A gap exists in determining if gender differences in adherence are mediated by DD and DS, or if gender moderates differences in adherence by DD/DS. . This study investigated the relationship between gender, DD, DS, and medication adherence and tested for mediating and moderating effects on medication adherence among American Indian adults with type  . . The Maawaji idi-oog mino-ayaawin (Gathering for Health) study was a community-based participatory research collaboration with five American Indian tribes. Participants, randomly recruited from clinic records, shared information during computer-assisted personal interviews. This study includes the 166 participants who reported using medications to treat their . The relationship between gender, DD, DS, and medication adherence are explored. Possible mediating and moderating effects on medication were tested using regression and path analysis.  Females had higher levels of DD and DS and lower levels of medication adherence. Higher levels of DD and DS were both associated with lower medication adherence. No evidence was found that gender moderates the relationship between DD or DS and medication adherence. Instead, DD and DS mediated the relationship between gender and medication adherence. . Medication adherence differences in male and female patients may be attributable to DD and DS.

Th2 immunity involves a shift of the CD4 T-cell population from type-0 to type- (Th2) with increased abundance of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. This study sought to investigate if existing gut-restricted intestinal helminth infections impact bacterial-induced acute airway neutrophil recruitment. C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: uninfected; helminth-Heligmosomoides polygyrus infected; Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected; and coinfected. Mice infected with H. polygyrus were incubated for  weeks, followed by P. aeruginosa intranasal inoculation. Bronchial alveolar lavage, blood, and lung samples were analyzed. Interestingly, infection with gut-restricted helminths resulted in immunological and structural changes in the lung. These changes include increased lung CD4 T cells, increased Th2 cytokine expression, and airway goblet cell hyperplasia. Furthermore, coinfected mice exhibited significantly more airspace neutrophil infiltration at 6 hours following P. aeruginosa infection and exhibited an improved rate of survival compared with bacterial infected alone. These results suggest that chronic helminth infection of the intestines can influence and enhance acute airway neutrophil responses to P. aeruginosa infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678625>Association of low serum magnesium with  and hypertension: findings from Qatar Biobank Study.</a></h2><p>We aimed to examine the association between serum magnesium and  and hypertension among Qatari adults.In the cross-sectional study, we used data from 9693 Qatari participants) aged 20 years and above attending the Qatar Biobank (QBB) Study.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

This insufficiency is mostly post-ischaemic in nature, but other aetiologies are possible in this high-risk population. In patients with DT2, diabetic cardiomyopathy is a recognized cause of cardiac insufficiency secondary to chronic hyperglycaemia and myocardial lipotoxicity, which promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (and, frequently, apoptosis of these cells), interstitial fibrosis and a decrease in myocardial contractile performance. Several studies have shown that diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with modifications to the intestinal microbiota, and changes in the synthesis of bacterial metabolites and their diffusion into the host, some of which appear to have direct deleterious effects on cardiac contractility. These findings open up new perspectives for pathophysiological studies by establishing the presence of a 'microbiota-myocardium' axis and raising the possibility of innovative new treatments. Correction of intestinal dysbiosis in patients with cardiac insufficiency could, therefore, constitute an innovative therapeutic approach to cases of this disease with a poor prognosis.Copyright © 2019.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type  , in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5--fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate their prescription patterns in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence (PINNACLE) registry. We analyzed patients enrolled in NCDR PINNACLE registry from January 2013 to March 2015 who underwent PCI with drug-eluting stent and were prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy. All patients received aspirin. The primary study outcome was a 3-level variable denoting the second antiplatelet agent prescribed: (1) clopidogrel, () prasugrel, or (3) ticagrelor. Baseline characteristics were compared among the 3 groups. Odds ratios and 95% credible intervals were calculated from a nested hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression models to identify independent predictors of prescription of antiplatelet medications, incorporating practice and provider as random effects. Our study cohort consisted of 26,710 patients during our study period January 2013 to March 2015. Seventy nine percent of patients were prescribed clopidogrel, 12% prasugrel, and 11% ticagrelor. Patients aged ≥75 years, women, history of tobacco use, Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD), hypertension, , previous vascular complication, heart failure, and stroke/transient ischemic attack were more likely to be on clopidogrel than prasugrel or ticagrelor. The relative percentages of ticagrelor and prasugrel were higher in patients with history of myocardial infarction, compared with those without myocardial infarction. In summary, our study highlights the prescription patterns associated with prescription of antiplatelet agents after PCI. We found that both ticagrelor and prasugrel were mostly prescribed per the current practice guidelines, thus reflecting appropriate guideline adherence by practices in NCDR PINNACLE registry.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Hypoxia inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) degradation, which leads to cellular adaptive responses through HIF-1-dependent activation of gene hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE). However, the diabetic microenvironment represses the HIF-1/HRE response in PTC. Here we studied the mechanism and consequences of impaired HIF-1α regulation in human proximal tubular HK- cells incubated in hyperglycemia. Inhibition at different levels of the canonical pathway of HIF-1α degradation did not activate the HIF-1/HRE response under hyperglycemia, except when proteasome was inhibited. Further studies suggested that hyperglycemia disrupts the interaction of HIF-1α with Hsp90, a known cause of proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α. Impaired HIF-1α regulation in cells exposed to hyperglycemic, hypoxic diabetic-like milieu led to diminished production of vascular endothelial growth factor-A and inhibition of cell migration (responses respectively involved in tubular protection and repair). These effects, as well as impaired HIF-1α regulation, were reproduced in normoglycemia in HK- cells incubated with microparticles released by HK- cells exposed to diabetic-like milieu. In summary, these results highlight the role of proteasome-dependent mechanisms of HIF-1α degradation on -induced HK- cells dysfunction and suggest that cell-derived microparticles may mediate negative effects of the diabetic milieu on PTC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675274>Relevant Features in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Determined Using Machine Learning for Feature Selection.</a></h2><p> We investigated the prevalence and the most relevant features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, (NAFLD) in which the inflammation of hepatocytes can lead to increased cardiovascular risk, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and the need for liver transplant.

However, myocardial infarction in SMuRF-less individuals is not uncommon. This study uses  sequential large, multicenter registries to examine the proportion and outcomes of SMuRF-less ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Methods and Results We identified 3081 STEMI patients without a prior history of cardiovascular disease in the Australian GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) and CONCORDANCE (Cooperative National Registry of Acute Coronary Syndrome Care) registries, encompassing 42 hospitals, between 1999 and 2017. We examined the proportion that were SMuRF-less as well as outcomes. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or heart failure, during the index admission). Multivariate regression models were used to identify predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events. Of STEMI patients without a prior history of cardiovascular disease 19% also had no history of SMuRFs. This proportion increased from 14% to 23% during the study period (=0.0067). SMuRF-less individuals had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than individuals with 1 or more SMuRFs. There were no clinically significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular events at 6 months between the  groups. Conclusions A substantial and increasing proportion of STEMI presentations occur independently of SMuRFs. Discovery of new markers and mechanisms of disease beyond standard risk factors may facilitate novel preventative strategies. Studies to assess longer-term outcomes of SMuRF-less STEMI patients are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671589>Effects of Periodic Fasting on Fatty Liver Index-A Prospective Observational Study.</a></h2><p>This prospective observational trial investigated effects and safety of periodic fasting in subjects with and without type   (T2DM). The primary end point was set as the change of fatty liver index (FLI) as a surrogate parameter of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Six-hundred and ninety-seven subjects (38 with T2DM) were enrolled. A baseline FLI ≥ 60 (the threshold for fatty liver) was found in 264 subjects (37.9%). The mean duration of fasting was 8.5 ± 4.0 days (range 6-38). FLI decreased significantly (-14.02 ± 11.67;  < 0.0001), with a larger effect in individuals with T2DM (-19.15 ± 11.0;  < 0.0001;  = 0.002 compared to non-diabetic subjects). Body mass index (BMI) decreased by -1.51 ± 0.82 kg/m, and 49.9% of the subjects lost ≥5% body weight. After fasting, nearly half of the 264 subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (highest risk category) shifted to a lower category. The improvement of FLI correlated with the number of fasting days (r = -0.20,  < 0.0001) and with the magnitude of BMI reduction (r = 0.14,  = 0.0001). Periodic fasting with concomitant weight reduction leads to significant rapid improvement of FLI in subjects with and without T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672719>Metformin decreases hyaluronan synthesis by vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Metformin is the first-line drug in the treatment of type   worldwide based on its effectiveness and cardiovascular safety. Currently metformin is increasingly used during pregnancy in women with gestational , even if the long-term effects of metformin on offspring are not exactly known. We have previously shown that high glucose concentration increases hyaluronan (HA) production of cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) via stimulating the expression of hyaluronan synthase  (). This offers a potential mechanism whereby hyperglycemia leads to vascular macroangiopathy. In this study, we examined whether gestational metformin use affects HA content in the aortic wall of mouse offspring in vivo. We also examined the effect of metformin on HA synthesis by cultured human VSMCs in vitro. We found that gestational metformin use significantly decreased HA content in the intima-media of mouse offspring aortas. In accordance with this, the synthesis of HA by VSMCs was also significantly decreased in response to treatment with metformin. This decrease in HA synthesis was shown to be due to the reduction of both the expression of  and the amount of HAS substrates, particularly UDP--acetylglucosamine. As shown here, gestational metformin use is capable to program reduced HA content in the vascular wall of the offspring strongly supporting the idea, that metformin possesses long-term vasculoprotective effects.© American Federation for Medical Research 2019.

A total of 10 fractions, including a total triterpenes fraction and a crude polysaccharides fraction for each, were prepared for further assays. Activities of α-glucosidase and α-amylase are inhibited dominantly by triterpenes from all five Ganoderma species rather than the polysaccharides. G. lucidum triterpenes inhibits α-glucosidase and α-amylase most significantly with IC50 values of 10.02 ± 0.95 µg/mL and 31.82 ± 4.30 µg/mL. Even more, triterpenes content was positively correlated with anti-α-glucosidase and anti-α-amylase activities. Therefore, triterpenes were considered to be the active compounds in inhibiting α-glucosidase and α-amylase activity. It is hoped that the results will provide more systematic information for the application of Ganoderma in the functional food and traditional medicine industries in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677301>The association between family history of  and offspring long- term neurological hospitalization.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to determine whether being born to non-diabetic mother with a family history of  (DM), is associated with higher rates of long-term neurological hospitalizations of the offspring.A retrospective analysis of all live births and pediatric hospitalizations at Soroka University Medical Center between 1991-2014 was performed. Family history of DM was collected from prepartum women using anamnesis. During the study period 208,728 deliveries met the inclusion criteria, of them 8.% (n=17040) were of non-diabetic mothers with family history of DM. Rates of neurological hospitalization with or without family history were analyzed.Offspring born to non-diabetic mothers with family history of DM had higher rates of neurological hospitalizations. The cumulative incidence of long-term neurological hospitalizations was higher as compared with those without family history of DM (log-rank test P=0.007). Neurological hospitalizations was higher by 13% in the study group, after controlling for confounders such as maternal age, maternal obesity, hypertensive disorders, birth weight and cesarean delivery. (adjusted odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.23) CONCLUSION: Being born to a non-diabetic mother with a family history of DM is independently associated with higher long-term neurological hospitalizations of the offspring.© 2019 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

However, SGA treatment is associated with severe metabolic alterations and body weight gain, which can increase the risk of type   and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that metabolic changes in insulin-sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the metabolic disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole-body glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG, lipid dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on insulin signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and insulin secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667853>Apparent mineralocorticoid excess as a side effect of ketoconazole therapy in a patient with Cushing's disease.</a></h2><p>Severe hypercortisolism in Cushing's syndrome may lead to a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess. The mineralocorticoid receptor is nonselective and has similar affinities for aldosterone and cortisol. In fact, the specificity of aldosterone for its renal receptor actually depends on the local inactivation of cortisol by kidney type  11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, an enzymatic inactivation that may be overridden when very large amounts of cortisol are present.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672457>Diffusion tensor imaging MR Neurography detects polyneuropathy in type  .</a></h2><p>To evaluate if diffusion-tensor-imaging MR-Neurography (DTI-MRN) can detect lesions of peripheral nerves due to polyneuropathy in patients with type  .Ten patients with type   with polyneuropathy (DPN), 10 patients with type   without polyneuropathy (nDPN) as well as 20 healthy controls (HC) were included. DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions (tibial nerve) of the lower extremity. Fractional-anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity (mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD)) were calculated and compared to neuropathy severity. Conventional T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density data were obtained from a multi-echo SE sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity and specificity of DTI-MRN from receiver operating characteristics (ROC).The proximal and distal FA was lowest in patients with DPN compared with nDPN and HC (p < 0.01). Likewise, proximal and distal RD was highest in patients with DPN (p < 0.01). MD and AD were also significantly different though less pronounced. ROC curve analyses of DTI separated nDPN and DPN with area-under-the-curve values ranging from 0.65 to 0.98.

The objective was to determine if the association of ACEs, examined with Latent Class Analysis (LCA), with CVD and  was stronger in patients with versus without depression.Participants were 78,435 non-institutionalized adults in the United States completing the ACEs module in the 2011-2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. LCA grouped participants into ACE classes. Respondents self-reported ACEs and lifetime depression,  and CVD. Complex survey weighted logistic regression models assessed the relationships between ACEs, , and CVD overall and in those with and without depression.Half of participants were female (48.6%) and 82.3% White, non-Hispanic. LCA identified a four-class solution characterized as 'low adversity', 'verbal/physical abuse', 'sexual abuse', and 'high adversity'. The odds ratios for each ACE class and  were similar in those with and without depression. An overall adjusted model showed that 'sexual abuse' versus 'low adversity' was significantly associated with  (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.05-1.61). Effect modification was present for CVD such that among those with depression, but not among those without, 'high adversity' had over two times the odds of CVD than 'low adversity' (OR = .17; 95% CI: 1.06-.93).'High adversity' in those with but not without depression is positively associated with CVD. 'Sexual abuse' is positively associated with  independent of depression.

High fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced insulin resistance is implicated in multiple metabolic diseases, such as type   (T2DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), these metabolic diseases has become epidemic health issue worldwide. In this study, the effect of C. lanceolata polysaccharide (CLPS) on improving insulin sensitivity in chronic HFHS diet-fed mice was investigated. Our data indicates that CLPS significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting serum insulin (FINS) and insulin resistance index, in parallel with improved glucose and insulin tolerance impaired by HFHS diet. Impaired phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 were observed in the mice fed with HFHS diet, and those defects were also rescued by CLPS administration. In addition, CLPS caused a significant decrease in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidised glutathione (GSSG) ratio; concurrent with enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and activated Nrf2 signaling. In summary, these findings suggest that CLPS ameliorates HFHS diet-induced insulin resistance through activating anti-oxidative signaling pathway, providing new insights into the protective effects of C. lanceolata polysaccharide in metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019.

We investigated factors associated with T2D remission and relapse after RYGB.Retrospective review of consecutive patients with T2D who underwent RYGB between 1993 and 2017. T2D remission was defined as medications discontinuation and/or HbA1c<6.5%; relapse was defined as recurrent medication use and/or HbA1c≥6.5%. Independent correlates of T2D remission and relapse were identified using logistic regression.621 patients (aged 46.7±10.6 years; 30% on insulin; BMI 49.8±8.3 kg/m) had at least one-year follow-up. Median follow-up was 4.9 (range 1-23.6) years. Prevalence of T2D remission was 74% at one year, 73% from one to three years, 63% between 3 and 10 years, and 47% beyond 10 years. 93% of remissions occurred within 3 years of RYGB, 25% relapsed. The median (IQR) time to relapse was 5.3 (3-7.8) years after remission. Higher one-year percentage total body weight (%TBW) loss, lack of preoperative insulin use, and younger age at surgery were independently associated with T2D remission. Preoperative insulin use, lower %TBW loss at one year, and greater %TBW gain after one year were independently associated with T2D relapse.This longitudinal retrospective analysis shows that preoperative insulin use and age, one-year weight loss, and regain after that influence T2D remission and relapse following RYGB. Referring patients at a younger age, before insulin is needed, and optimizing both weight loss and weight maintenance after RYGB may improve the rates and durability of T2D remission.Copyright © 2019.

Associations between high MSC (≥9.3 nmol/l) and high systolic BP (>130 mm Hg), and high diastolic BP (>80 mm Hg) were explored for all patients, users and non-users of antihypertensive drugs (AHD). Adjustments were performed for age, sex,  related variables, p-creatinine, smoking, physical inactivity, depression and medication.The prevalence of high MSC differed between patients with high and low systolic BP in all 196 patients: 39% versus 13 % (p = 0.001); in 60 users of AHD: 37% versus 12% (p = 0.039), and in 136 non-users of AHD: 43% versus 13% (p = 0.012). Significant associations with high systolic BP were for all patients: physical inactivity (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 6.5), high MSC (AOR 3.9), abdominal obesity (AOR 3.7), AHD (AOR .9), age (per year) (AOR 1.07), and p-creatinine (per µmol/l) (AOR 1.03); for 60 users of AHD: high MSC (AOR 4.1) and age (per year) (AOR 1.11); for 136 non-users of AHD: abdominal obesity (AOR 27.4), physical inactivity (AOR 14.7), male sex (AOR 9.0), smoking (AOR 7.9), and age (per year) (AOR 1.08).

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity measures in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal-weight (77%) -6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (p < 0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (p > 0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal-weight population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of body fat in preschoolers. The role of vigorous PA in the prevention of early childhood obesity should be further investigated in future studies.ISRCTN ISRCTN41045021 .

Previous work has shown that odanacatib increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with low bone mass. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of odanacatib to reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.The Long-term Odanacatib Fracture Trial (LOFT) was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven study at 388 outpatient clinics in 40 countries. Eligible participants were women aged at least 65 years who were postmenopausal for 5 years or more, with a femoral neck or total hip bone mineral density T-score between -·5 and -4·0 if no previous radiographic vertebral fracture, or between -1·5 and -4·0 with a previous vertebral fracture. Women with a previous hip fracture, more than one vertebral fracture, or a T-score of less than -4·0 at the total hip or femoral neck were not eligible unless they were unable or unwilling to use approved osteoporosis treatment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either oral odanacatib (50 mg once per week) or matching placebo. Randomisation was done using an interactive voice recognition system after stratification for previous radiographic vertebral fracture, and treatment was masked to study participants, investigators and their staff, and sponsor personnel. If the study completed before 5 years of double-blind treatment, consenting participants could enrol in a double-blind extension study (LOFT Extension), continuing their original treatment assignment for up to 5 years from randomisation. Primary endpoints were incidence of vertebral fractures as assessed using radiographs collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months, yearly, and at final study visit in participants for whom evaluable radiograph images were available at baseline and at least one other timepoint, and hip and non-vertebral fractures adjudicated as being a result of osteoporosis as assessed by clinical history and radiograph. Safety was assessed in participants who received at least one dose of study drug. The adjudicated cardiovascular safety endpoints were a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, and new-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter. Individual cardiovascular endpoints and death were also assessed. LOFT and LOFT Extension are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number ) and the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT number 2007-002693-66).Between Sept 14, 2007, and Nov 17, 2009, we randomly assigned 16 071 evaluable patients to treatment: 8043 to odanacatib and 8028 to placebo. After a median follow-up of 36·5 months (IQR 34·43-40·15) 4297 women assigned to odanacatib and 3960 assigned to placebo enrolled in LOFT Extension (total median follow-up 47·6 months, IQR 35·45-60·06). In LOFT, cumulative incidence of primary outcomes for odanacatib versus placebo were: radiographic vertebral fractures 3·7% (251/6770) versus 7·8% (542/6910), hazard ratio (HR) 0·46, 95% CI 0·40-0·53; hip fractures 0·8% (65/8043) versus 1·6% (125/8028), 0·53, 0·39-0·71; non-vertebral fractures 5·1% (412/8043) versus 6·7% (541/8028), 0·77, 0·68-0·87; all p<0·0001. Combined results from LOFT plus LOFT Extension for cumulative incidence of primary outcomes for odanacatib versus placebo were: radiographic vertebral fractures 4·9% (341/6909) versus 9·6% (675/7011), HR 0·48, 95% CI 0·42-0·55; hip fractures 1·1% (86/8043) versus ·0% (162/8028), 0·52, 0·40-0·67; non-vertebral fractures 6·4% (512/8043) versus 8·4% (675/8028), 0·74, 0·66-0·83; all p<0·0001. In LOFT, the composite cardiovascular endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 273 (3·4%) of 8043 patients in the odanacatib group versus 245 (3·1%) of 8028 in the placebo group (HR 1·12, 95% CI 0·95-1·34; p=0·18). New-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter occurred in 112 (1·4%) of 8043 patients in the odanacatib group versus 96 (1·%) of 8028 in the placebo group (HR 1·18, 0·90-1·55; p=0·24). Odanacatib was associated with an increased risk of stroke (1·7% [136/8043] vs 1·3% [104/8028], HR 1·32, 1·02-1·70; p=0·034), but not myocardial infarction (0·7% [60/8043] vs 0·9% [74/8028], HR 0·82, 0·58-1·15; p=0·26). The HR for all-cause mortality was 1·13 (5·0% [401/8043] vs 4·4% [356/8028], 0·98-1·30; p=0·10).When data from LOFT Extension were included, the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in significantly more patients in the odanacatib group than in the placebo group (401 [5·0%] of 8043 vs 343 [4·3%] of 8028, HR 1·17, 1·02-1·36; p=0·029, as did stroke (·3% [187/8043] vs 1·7% [137/8028], HR 1·37, 1·10-1·71; p=0·0051).Odanacatib reduced the risk of fracture, but was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, specifically stroke, in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Based on the overall balance between benefit and risk, the study's sponsor decided that they would no longer pursue development of odanacatib for treatment of osteoporosis.Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, a subsidiary of Merck & Co, Inc, Kenilworth, NJ, USA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Body composition was assessed with BIA and BIVA in 88 PD patients (53.4 ± 13.1 years; 67% male). Patients with obesity and/or with reduced muscle mass were identified using FMI and SM/BW cutoff values, respectively. Inflammatory status was assessed by measuring CRP and fibrinogen blood levels.A total of 44.3% of the patients showed a reduced muscle mass (37.5% moderate and 6.8% severe). The prevalence of obesity was 6.1%, 81.8%, and 100% in patients with normal, moderately, and severely reduced muscle mass, respectively (p < 0.05). Of the total, 15.% of the patients with normal muscle mass, 18.4% of those with moderately reduced muscle mass, and 66.7% of those with severely reduced muscle mass had . The prevalence of severe muscle mass loss was higher in those with  than in those without  (22.% vs. .8%, p < 0.05). Patients with obesity-associated muscle wasting showed higher fibrinogen (613.9 ± 155.1 vs. 512.9 ± 159.5 mg/dL, p < 0.05) and CPR (1.4 ± 1.3 vs. 0.6 ± 0.8 mg/dL, p < 0.05) blood concentrations than those with normal body composition.Obesity and  were strongly associated with muscle mass loss in our PD patients. It remains to be established whether prevention of obesity with nutritional interventions can halt the occurrence of muscle mass loss in patients on PD.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

These factors, at the cellular level, are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased glucose uptake. Such events are poorly explored in the context of the salivary glands. In this study, we present a series of eight cases of a distinct salivary gland lesion characterized by multiple oncocytic cysts, and we provide new pathologic insights regarding its pathogenesis.Seven patients (87.5%) had a confirmed T2D, and obesity was identified in five (62.5%) patients. Clinically, the patients demonstrated bilateral parotid gland swelling with recurrent episodes of pain and enlargements. Imaging exams revealed multiple cystic lesions in both parotid glands. Microscopically, the parotid glands showed multiple cysts of different sizes, lined by oncocytic epithelial cells. Intraluminally, high-eosinophilic glass-like crystalloid materials were observed. Immunohistochemical studies were performed and the most notable finding was GLUT1 overexpression in the oncocytic cysts (not observed in any other oncocytic lesion of patients without T2D). In addition, higher expressions of mitochondrial antigen, fission 1 protein, and mitofusin- were observed in the oncocytic epithelium of the cysts. Furthermore, most of the oncocytic cysts demonstrated a pattern of cytokeratin expression consistent with striated ducts.Thus, these results strongly suggest that T2D is associated with alterations in GLUT1 expression in the cells of striated ducts with mitochondrial dysfunction, causing a hyperplastic process characterized by multiple oncocytic cysts. For this lesion, the designation of " associated-bilateral multiple oncocytic cysts of the parotid gland" is proposed.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675449>Mycobacterium chelonae infection mimicking demodex folliculitis.</a></h2><p>A 69-year-old man was admitted to hospital with a three month history of a diffuse eruption of painful crusted erythematous papulopustular lesions involving the face and neck.

How it does so remains unclear. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the nuclear receptor of bile acids (BAs), is implicated in bariatric surgery. Moreover, the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel is expressed in pancreatic β-cells and involved in insulin secretion. We aimed to explore the role of BAs/FXR and TRPA1 in improved GSIS in diabetic rats after RYGB.RYGB or sham surgery was conducted in spontaneous diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, or FXR or TRPA1 transgenic mice. Gene and protein expression of islets were assessed by qPCR and western blotting. Electrophysiological properties of single β-cells were studied using patch-clamp technique. Binding of FXR and histone acetyltransferase steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC1) to the TRPA1 promoter, acetylated histone H3 (ACH3) levels at the TRPA1 promoter were determined using ChIP assays. GSIS was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT).RYGB increases GSIS, particularly the first-phase of GSIS in both intact islets and GK rats in vivo, and ameliorates hyperglycemia of GK rats. Importantly, the effects of RYGB were attenuated in TRPA1-deficient mice. Moreover, GK β-cells displayed significantly decreased TRPA1 expression and current. Patch-clamp recording revealed that TRPA1 β-cells displayed a marked hyperpolarization and decreased glucose-evoked action potential firing, which was associated with impaired GSIS. RYGB restored TRPA1 expression and current in GK β-cells. This was accompanied by improved glucose-evoked electrical activity and insulin secretion. Additionally, RYGB-induced TRPA1 expression involved BAs/FXR-mediated recruitment of SRC1, promoting ACH3 at the promoter of TRPA1.The BAs/FXR/SRC1 axis-mediated restoration of TRPA1 expression plays a critical role in the enhanced GSIS and remission of  in GK rats after RYGB.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In consideration of the common underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, exposure to air pollution may also increase the risk of gestational  (GDM), but the current evidence was inconsistent and has not well been systematically reviewed. Our goal was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the association between air pollution exposure and GDM.An extensive literature search was conducted in selected electronic databases for related human epidemiological studies published in English language. Summary effect estimates were calculated using random-effect models for a) risk per unit increase in continuous air pollutant concentration and b) risk of high versus low exposure level in individual study if each exposure that had been examined in ≥ studies. We evaluated the heterogeneity using Cochran's Q test and quantified it by I statistic. Publication bias was also evaluated through the funnel plot when sufficient number of studies are available.A total of 11 studies evaluating the association between GDM and exposure to air pollution were identified finally. The summary odds ratio (OR) for incidence of GDM following a 10 μg/m increase in PM exposure during the second trimester was 1.04 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.01, 1.09) and in NO during the first trimester was 1.03 (95%CI: 1.00, 1.07) per 10 ppb increase, while for high versus low SO exposure during the second trimester was 1.25 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.53). High heterogeneity among study-specific results in majority of the analyses were observed, and attributed to different exposure assessment methods, populations, study locations, and covariates adjustment. Publication bias cannot be excluded because of the inclusion of small number of studies.The present study supports the evidence that air pollution exposure increases the risk the GDM, albeit the existence of high heterogeneity. Further studies are necessary to elaborate the suggestive associations. These results are of public health significance since worsening air pollution in developing countries has been expected to increase the risk of GDM development.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the relation between arterial calcifications observed on routine hand and upper-extremity radiographs and atherosclerosis has not been determined. This study examined whether arterial calcifications found on hand radiographs are associated with CAD.A record review from a single institution identified 345 patients with both hand radiographs and CAD screening with cardiac stress testing or coronary angiography. Patients with chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, or incomplete hand films were excluded. We reviewed x-rays for findings of arterial calcifications. Cardiac testing results were used to establish a baseline diagnosis of CAD. We made group comparisons and employed multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the association between upper-extremity calcification and CAD.A total of 210 patients met inclusion criteria: 155 with CAD and 55 without it. Mean age was 72 years, body mass index was 28.8, and 54% were male. Patients had comorbidities of hypertension (91%), hyperlipidemia (87%),  (39%), cerebrovascular accident (9%), and a history of tobacco use (53%). Of 155 CAD patients, 67 had arterial calcifications on hand radiographs (43%), compared with 6 of 55 without it (11%). In a multivariable model controlling for sex, hyperlipidemia, and , the presence of arterial calcifications on hand plain films indicated a 6.-fold increased odds of CAD.The current data demonstrate that arterial calcifications on hand radiographs are independently associated with CAD. This may represent an opportunity to the treating physician as a point of referral or investigation for underlying or occult CAD.Prevalence III.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

As gut microbial imbalances and maladaptive host responses have been implicated in the pathology of obesity and , this study aimed to determine the effects of pharmacologically stimulated GLP-1 and GLP- receptor function on the gut microbiome composition in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice received treatment with a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide, 0. mg/kg, BID) or dual GLP-1/GLP- receptor agonist (GUB09-145, 0.04 mg/kg, BID) for 4 weeks. Both compounds suppressed caloric intake, promoted a marked weight loss, improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma cholesterol levels. 16S rDNA sequencing and deep-sequencing shotgun metagenomics was applied for comprehensive within-subject profiling of changes in gut microbiome signatures. Compared to baseline, DIO mice assumed phylogenetically similar gut bacterial compositional changes following liraglutide and GUB09-145 treatment, characterized by discrete shifts in low-abundant species and related bacterial metabolic pathways. The microbiome alterations may potentially associate to the converging biological actions of GLP-1 and GLP- receptor signaling on caloric intake, glucose metabolism and lipid handling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669883>Reduction of cardiac and renal dysfunction by new inhibitor of DPP4 in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Increased mortality due to type   (T2DM) has been associated with renal and/or cardiovascular dysfunction. Dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 inhibitors (iDPP-4s) may exert cardioprotective effects through their pleiotropic actions via glucagon-like peptide 1-dependent mechanisms. In this study, the pharmacological profile of a new iDPP-4 (LASSBio-2124) was investigated in rats with cardiac and renal dysfunction induced by T2DM.T2DM was induced in rats by  weeks of a high-fat diet followed by intravenous injection of streptozotocin. Metabolic disturbance and cardiac, vascular, and renal dysfunction were analyzed in the experimental groups.Sitagliptin and LASSBio-2124 administration after T2DM induction reduced elevated glucose levels to 319.8 ± 13. and 279.7 ± 17.8 mg/dL, respectively (p < 0.05). LASSBio-2124 also lowered the cholesterol and triglyceride levels from 76.8 ± 8.0 to 42.7 ± 3. mg/dL and from 229.7 ± 25.4 to 100.7 ± 17.1 mg/dL, in diabetic rats. Sitagliptin and LASSBio-2124 reversed the reduction of the plasma insulin level. LASSBio-2124 recovered the increased urinary flow in diabetic animals and reduced 24-h proteinuria from 23.7 ± 1.5 to 13.3 ± .8 mg (p < 0.05). It also reduced systolic and diastolic left-ventricular dysfunction in hearts from diabetic rats.The effects of LASSBio-2124 were superior to those of sitagliptin in the cardiovascular systems of T2DM rats.

We finally included 469 (97.30%) participants who had no missing data for data analysis. We collected individual data on socio-demographics, behavioral habits, and health information through standardized questionnaires. Satellite-based PM concentrations from 2013 to 2016 were assigned based on participants' residential addresses. The association between PM and FPG was examined using a generalized linear regression model while FPG was modeled as a continuous variable. An ordered logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between PM and FPG categories.Every 1 μg/m³ increase in PM was associated with a 0.34 mg/dL [95 confidence interval (95% CI): 0.08 mg/dL, 0.59 mg/dL] increase in FPG levels. Comparing with the low FPG level (under 86 mg/dL), every 1 μg/m³ increase in PM was associated with a 10.20% (95% CI: 1.60%, 19.80%) increase in the odds of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (100-125 mg/dL).

Aim of this study was to identify perioperative risk factors for anastomotic leak and for 60-day morbidity and mortality after ileocolic anastomoses (stapled vs handsewn).This is a STROBE-compliant study. Demographic and surgical data were gathered from patients with an ileocolic anastomosis performed between November 2010 and September 2016 at a tertiary hospital. Anastomoses were performed using standardised techniques. Independent risk factors for anastomotic leak, complications and mortality were assessed.We included 477 patients: 53.7% of the anastomoses were hand sewn and 46.3% stapled. Laterolateral anastomosis was the most common configuration (93.3%). Anastomotic leak was diagnosed in 8.8% of patients and 36 were classified as major anastomotic leak (7.5%). In the multivariate analysis, male sex ( = 0.014, odds ratio, OR, .9), arterial hypertension ( = 0.048, OR .29) and perioperative transfusions ( < 0.001, OR .4 per litre) were independent risk factors for major anastomotic leak. The overall 60-day complication rate was 27.3%. Male sex (31.3% vs female 22.3%,  = 0.02, OR 1.7),  ( = 0.03 OR .0), smoking habit ( = 0.04, OR 1.8) and perioperative transfusions ( < 0.001, OR 3.3 per litre) were independent risk factors for postoperative morbidity. The 60-day-mortality rate was 3.1% and no significant risk factors were identified.Anastomotic leak after ileocolic anastomosis is a relevant problem.

The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound -(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic acid, Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects.

Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

Muscle mass loss is associated with weakness, fatigue, and insulin resistance. In fact, it is predicted that controlling muscle atrophy can reduce morbidity and mortality associated with diseases such as cancer cachexia and sarcopenia.We analyzed gene expression data from muscle of mice or human patients with diverse muscle pathologies and identified LMCD1 as a gene strongly associated with skeletal muscle function. We transiently expressed or silenced LMCD1 in mouse gastrocnemius muscle or in mouse primary muscle cells and determined muscle/cell size, targeted gene expression, kinase activity with kinase arrays, protein immunoblotting, and protein synthesis levels. To evaluate force, calcium handling, and fatigue, we transduced the flexor digitorum brevis muscle with a LMCD1-expressing adenovirus and measured specific force and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release in individual fibers. Finally, to explore the relationship between LMCD1 and calcineurin, we ectopically expressed Lmcd1 in the gastrocnemius muscle and treated those mice with cyclosporine A (calcineurin inhibitor). In addition, we used a luciferase reporter construct containing the myoregulin gene promoter to confirm the role of a LMCD1-calcineurin-myoregulin axis in skeletal muscle mass control and calcium handling.Here, we identify LIM and cysteine-rich domains 1 (LMCD1) as a positive regulator of muscle mass, that increases muscle protein synthesis and fiber size. LMCD1 expression in vivo was sufficient to increase specific force with lower requirement for calcium handling and to reduce muscle fatigue. Conversely, silencing LMCD1 expression impairs calcium handling and force, and induces muscle fatigue without overt atrophy. The actions of LMCD1 were dependent on calcineurin, as its inhibition using cyclosporine A reverted the observed hypertrophic phenotype. Finally, we determined that LMCD1 represses the expression of myoregulin, a known negative regulator of muscle performance. Interestingly, we observed that skeletal muscle LMCD1 expression is reduced in patients with skeletal muscle disease.Our gain- and loss-of-function studies show that LMCD1 controls protein synthesis, muscle fiber size, specific force, Ca handling, and fatigue resistance. This work uncovers a novel role for LMCD1 in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and function with potential therapeutic implications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676331>Risk Factors for Major Amputation in Hospitalized Diabetic Patients with Forefoot Ulcers.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk factors for major amputation in patients hospitalized with diabetic forefoot ulcers.Between January 2003 and December 2018, a total of 1,792 diabetic patients were admitted to the diabetic wound center for the management of diabetic foot ulcers. Among the patients, 1,032 diabetic patients with forefoot ulcers were included in this study. Nine hundred and eighty-three patients (95%) healed without major amputations while 49 patients (5%) healed after major amputations. Data related to 88 potential risk factors including demographics, ulcer condition, vascularity, bioburden, neurology, and serology were collected from the patients in these two groups for comparison.Among the 88 potential risk factors, 34 showed statistically significant differences between the two groups. In the univariate analysis of 88 risk factors, 33 showed statistically significant differences. In stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, four of the 33 risk factors remained statistically significant. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for gender, magnesium levels, platelet levels, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were 8.216, .480, 1.009, and 0.570, respectively.Risk factors for major amputation in patients hospitalized with diabetic forefoot ulcers include male gender, increased magnesium, increased platelet levels, and low levels of HbA1c.Copyright © 2019.

Due to its pathological similarities to type   (T2DM), such as β-amyloid deposition, oxidative stress, inflammation, disordered glucose metabolism, impaired signaling pathways of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), we speculate that AD is another form of brain . Clarifying the relationship between T2DM and AD is important for us to better understand the exact pathological mechanisms of AD. Silibinin, a polyphenolic flavonoid extracted from the seeds of Silybum marianum, exerts hepatoprotective, anti- diabetic and neuroprotective effects. Streptozotocin (STZ), which is used to disrupt the insulin signal transduction pathway, could well mimic the sporadic AD models by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. Therefore, we selected ICV injection of STZ (ICV-STZ) to investigate the neuroprotective effects of silibinin in rats and to make a foundation for further exploring the relationship between AD and T2DM. ICV-STZ obviously caused memory damage, sharply reduced the number of nissl bodies and destroyed morphological structure of hippocampal neuronal cells, while silibinin attenuated the damages. Moreover, silibinin significantly decreased STZ-induced tau hyperphosphorylation (ser404) in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, markedly inhibited apoptosis of neurons induced by STZ, and up-regulated insulin signal transduction pathway. Silibinin exerts neuroprotective effect in STZ-treated rats, indicating the potential of silibinin for the treatment of AD patients with T2DM in future.Copyright © 2019.

The subgingival microbiome, a key player in periodontitis pathogenesis, is not well characterized in T2DM population. To better understand whether the subgingival microbiome is different between T2DM and systemically healthy, nondiabetic (ND) subjects, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the subgingival microbiome in T2DM patients (n = 15) compared with ND subjects (n = 16). Using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, we investigated the microbiome in the healthy periodontal state, periodontitis state, and resolved state after treatment. We found that in the periodontitis state, the shift in the subgingival microbiome from the healthy state was less prominent in T2DM compared with ND subjects, yet the clinical signs of disease were similar for both. Furthermore, we revealed highly correlated presence of pathogenic species in relative abundance not only in the periodontitis state, but also in the healthy state in T2DM, suggesting an elevated risk of progression to periodontitis in this cohort. We further investigated the functional potentials of the subgingival microbiome and identified a set of microbial marker genes associated with the clinical states. These genes were significantly enriched in 21 pathways, some of which are associated with periodontitis and some potentially link T2DM and periodontitis. This study identified the longitudinal changes of the subgingival microbiome associated with periodontitis in T2DM and suggests that T2DM patients are more susceptible to shifts in the subgingival microbiome toward dysbiosis, potentially due to impaired host metabolic and immune regulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673895>Mini-doses of glucagon to prevent hypoglycemia in children with type 1  refusing food: a case series.</a></h2><p>Hypoglycemia in small children with type 1  is difficult to manage if nausea, vomit or food refusal occurs. If oral carbohydrate cannot be used, there is a hypothetical risk of severe hypoglycemia. The present article describes the effect on glucose of small doses of subcutaneous glucagon to revert hypoglycemia and prevent severe events in small children with type 1  using a continuous glucose monitoring.We analyzed 4 episodes of impending or mild hypoglycemia in 3 children with type 1  who refused to eat carbohydrates. Using a standard U-100 insulin syringe, children received one "unit" (10 μg) of glucagon subcutaneously for every year of age up to 15 units (150 μg). If the blood glucose did not increase within 30 min, the initial dosage was repeated at that time. Instructions were given by phone from the physician. At the following visit data from continuous glucose monitoring devices, insulin pump and glucometer were downloaded and reviewed retrospectively from the physician.Blood glucose from continuous glucose monitoring after one and  h was 127 ± 80 mg/dl and 165 ± 78 mg/dl, respectively. After a glucagon injection, there was a single recurrence of hypoglycemia, requiring another shot. The glucagon was well tolerated, except for nausea, present before the injection. None of the children were taken to our hospital because of concerns for hypoglycemia.Mini-doses of glucagon given subcutaneously were effective and safe in preventing frank or impending hypoglycemia in type 1  children refusing food.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669629>Clinical features, biochemistry and HLA-DRB1 status in children and adolescents with  in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</a></h2><p>Little information is published on  in young people in Bangladesh. We aimed to investigate the demographic, clinical, and biochemical features, and HLA-DRB1 alleles in new cases of  affecting Bangladeshi children and adolescents <22 years of age.The study was conducted at Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation of , Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders (BIRDEM) in Dhaka. One hundred subjects aged <22 years at diagnosis were enrolled. Demographic characteristics, clinical information, biochemical parameters (blood glucose, HbA1c, C-peptide, and autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GADA) and islet antigen- (IA-2A) were measured. High-resolution DNA genotyping was performed for HLA-DRB1.Eighty-four subjects were clinically diagnosed as type 1  (T1D), seven as type   (T2D), and nine as fibrocalculous pancreatic disease (FCPD). Of the 84 with T1D, 37 (44%) were males and 47 (56%) females, with median age at diagnosis 13 years (range 1.6-21.7) and peak age at onset 12-15 years. 85% of subjects were assessed within one month of diagnosis and all within eleven months. For subjects diagnosed with T1D, mean C-peptide was 0.46±0.22 nmol/L (1.40±0.59 ng/mL), with 9 (10.7%) IA-2A positive, 22 (26%) GADA positive, and 5 (6%) positive for both autoantibodies. Analysis of HLA-DRB1 genotypes revealed locus-level T1D association (p=6.0E-05); DRB1*04:01 appeared predisposing (p<3.0E-06), and DRB1*14:01 appeared protective (p=1.7E-02).Atypical forms of T1D appear to be more common in young people in Bangladesh than in European populations.

Increased intestinal permeability is related with obesity, insulin resistance, type 1 and  . The existence of such a relationship between PCOS and intestinal permeability has come to an end. Zonulin can change intestinal permeability, and this effect is reversible. We studied the relation between zonulin and the hormonal and metabolic parameters of PCOS.A total of 45 women with PCOS and 17 healthy women were included in the study. Histories were taken from all the participants, body mass indexes were calculated, and biochemical tests and suprapubic over ultrasonography were made. Zonulin was studied with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Serum zonulin levels were similar between PCOS and control groups (p = 0.893). In all participants, there were negative correlations between zonulin and the total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and non-HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.00, 0.018, 0.004, 0.002), there were boundary correlations with age and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.052 and 0.058). No statistically significant was detected in the PCOS group except negative correlation between zonulin and age (p = 0.046), boundary correlation between zonulin and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.064).PCOS patients did not have metabolic syndrome. Zonulin was not higher in PCOS then controls, and it had only negative relation with age. The negative relation between zonulin and some metabolic parameters in all participants was not detected in PCOS group.

To explain this heterogeneity, we sought to identify a composite signature predictive of insulin secretion, using a collaborative assay evaluation and analysis pipeline that incorporated multiple cellular and serum measures reflecting beta cell health and immune system activity. The ability to predict decline in insulin secretion would be useful for patient stratification for clinical trial enrollment or therapeutic selection. Analytes from 12 qualified assays were measured in shared samples from subjects newly diagnosed with T1D. We developed a computational tool to identify a composite panel associated with decline in insulin secretion over  years after diagnosis. The tool employs multiple filtering steps to reduce data dimensionality, incorporates error-estimation techniques including cross-validation and sensitivity analysis, and is flexible to assay type, clinical outcome and disease setting. Using this novel analytical tool, we identified a panel of immune markers that, in combination, are highly associated with loss of insulin secretion. The methods used here represent a novel process for identifying combined immune signatures that predict outcomes relevant for complex and heterogeneous diseases like T1D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666268>Interventions to integrate care for people with serious mental illness and substance use disorders: a systematic scoping review protocol.</a></h2><p>People with serious mental illness (SMI) and/or substance use disorders (SUDs) have an elevated risk of premature mortality compared with the general population. This has been attributed to higher rates of chronic illness among these individuals, but also to inequities in healthcare access and treatment. Integrated care has the potential to improve the health of people with SMI/SUDs. The aims of this scoping review are to: (1) identify empirical investigations of interventions designed to integrate care for people with SMI/SUDs; () describe the underlying theories, models and frameworks of integrated care that informed their development; and (3) determine the degree to which interventions address dimensions of a comprehensive and validated framework of integrated care.Guidelines for best practice and reporting of scoping reviews will be followed using the framework of Arksey and O'Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses scoping review checklist. An iterative and systematic search of peer-reviewed publications reporting empirical research findings will be conducted. This literature will be identified by searching five databases: Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase (Ovid) and Scopus. The search will be restricted to articles published between January 2000 and April 2019. Two reviewers will independently screen publications in two successive stages of title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening of eligible publications. A tabular summary and narrative synthesis will be completed using data extracted from each included study. A framework synthesis will also be conducted, with descriptions of interventions mapped against a theoretical framework of integrated care.This review will identify the extent and nature of empirical investigations evaluating interventions to integrate care for people with SMI/SUDs. Ethical approval was not required. A team of relevant stakeholders, including people with lived experience of mental health conditions, has been established. This team will be engaged throughout the review and will ensure that the findings are widely disseminated. Dissemination will include publication of the review in a peer-reviewed journal.

Only a few studies have reported on the outcome and complications analysis but without consensus on the recipient vessels and flap chosen. Herein, we presented the outcome and analysed the risk factors for complications in sequential free flap reconstruction.Patients who had sequential free tissue transfers due to cancer recurrence, second primary cancer, or secondary correction of the soft tissue contractures and volume deficits were all included. Variables extracted included demographics, comorbidities, free flap characteristics, infection, dehiscence and flap necrosis rates.In total, 40 patients with 92 free flaps were analyzed; 42 initial and 50 sequential free flaps. The most common recipient vessels for sequential flap were contralateral superficial thyroid vessels (68%). The most common flap for both initial and sequential free flap was anterolateral thigh flap (64.3 and 62%). The success rate of sequential free flap was 92.0 compared to 92.9% for initial free flap, which showed no significant difference. Female was independently associated with delayed wound healing with an odds ratio of 90.91 (95% confidence interval 0.001-0.17, P = 0.001), as well as  with an odds ratio of 31.14 (95% confidence interval .60-373.19, P = 0.007). Sequential free flap was not a risk factor for any complication.Sequential free flap is a reliable method for head and neck surgery without more complication rate comparing to initial free flap reconstruction. More attentions should be paid on patients with preferential risk for certain complications.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Insulin, which is produced by β-pancreatic cells, is a chief orchestrator of glucose metabolism, regulating its consumption within cells, which leads to energy generation or storage as glycogen. Abnormally lower insulin secretion from β-cells, insulin insensitivity, and insulin tolerance lead to higher plasma glucose levels, resulting in metabolic complications. The last century has witnessed extraordinary efforts by the scientific community to develop anti-diabetic drugs, and these efforts yielded the discovery of exogenous insulin and various classes of oral anti-diabetic drugs.Despite these exhaustive anti-diabetic pharmaceutical and therapeutic efforts, long-term glycemic control, hypoglycemic crisis, safety issues, large-scale economic burden, side effects remain core problems.The last decade has witnessed the development of various new classes of anti-diabetic drugs with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profiles. Details of their FDA approvals and advantages/disadvantages are summarized in this review, Result: Salient features of insulin degludec, sodium glucose co-transporter  inhibitors, glucokinase activators, fibroblast growth factor 21 receptor agonists, and GLP-1 agonists are discussed.In the future, these new anti-diabetic drugs should have broad clinical applicability.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668723>Dietary n-6 to n-3 fatty acid ratio is related to liver fat content independent of genetic effects: Evidence from the monozygotic co-twin control design.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle changes focusing on diet and exercise remain the cornerstone of the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

GDM may be induced by dysregulation of pancreatic β-cell function and/or by alteration of secreted gestational hormones and peptides related with glucose homeostasis. It may affect one out of five pregnancies, leading to perinatal morbidity and adverse neonatal outcomes, and high risk of chronic metabolic and cardiovascular injuries in both mother and offspring. Currently, GDM diagnosis is based on evaluation of glucose homeostasis at late stages of pregnancy, but increased age and body-weight, and familiar or previous occurrence of GDM, may conditionate this criteria. In addition, an earlier and more specific detection of GDM with associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk could improve GDM development and outcomes. In this sense, 1st-2nd trimester-released biomarkers found in maternal plasma including adipose tissue-derived factors such as adiponectin, visfatin, omentin-1, fatty acid-binding protein-4 and retinol binding-protein-4 have shown correlations with GDM development. Moreover, placenta-related factors such as sex hormone-binding globulin, afamin, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factors-21/23, ficolin-3 and follistatin, or specific micro-RNAs may participate in GDM progression and be useful for its recognition. Finally, urine-excreted metabolites such as those related with serotonin system, non-polar amino-acids and ketone bodies, may complete a predictive or early-diagnostic panel of biomarkers for GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670385>Risk factors for neonatal brachial plexus palsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To provide a comprehensive update on the most prevalent, significant risk factors for neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP).Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for relevant publications up to March 2019.

Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis based on the current literature.We searched relevant databases on Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science prior to 10 May 2019 to determine the relationship between ferritin and the risk of GDM. The relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of GDM risk were summarized using a random effects model. Studies using categories of ferritin as exposure were combined by dose-response analysis. We conducted both linear and non-linear trends. We also performed subgroup analysis, whether or not the studies adjusted for potential confounders, and meta-regression analysis to explore the source of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the meta-analysis results.Ten studies involving 4690 participants were identified. The summary RR comparing persons with the highest concentration categories of ferritin with the lowest concentration categories of ferritin was 1.87 (95% CI: 1.50-.34; I =20.1%). Linear dose-response showed that an increase in ferritin of 10 μg/L increased the risk of GDM by 8% [1.08 (95% CI: 1.05-1.13), I =55.1%; n=4]. Non-linear dose-response also showed a consistently increasing risk of GDM with increased ferritin. No evidence of publication bias was detected.The findings from this meta-analysis suggest that increased ferritin levels are associated with an increased risk of GDM; however, we need further prospective cohort studies to confirm the results, especially the dose-response relationship between ferritin and GDM.© 2019 The Authors.

According to the number of the levels involved by OPLL, we stratified the patients into two subgroups: severe group (S-group) and non-severe group (NS-group) to delineate the characteristics of radiologically severe patients with cervical OPLL. We also evaluated the most compressed level and the degree of occupying ratio of cervical spinal canal by OPLL at the most compressed level.A total of 234 patients with a mean age of 65 years were recruited. The S-group consisted of 48 patients (21%, 12 females and 36 males) and the NS-group consisted of 92 patients (79%, 22 females and 70 males). The mean age of males in the S-group (68 years old) was significantly higher than that of males in the NS-group (64 years old); however there was no significant difference in the mean age in females between the S-group (69 years old) and the NS-group (66 years old). No significant difference of body mass index, ossification of the nuchal ligament-positivity and presence of  were found between the S- and the NS-group.It is likely that the manner of extension of cervical OPLL is different between male and female patients.Copyright © 2019.

We have studied the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] with markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.We have recruited total 180 male and female subjects aged between 30-50 years and divided them into two groups as control (n=90) and T2DM (n=90). We have measured 25(OH)D concentration, markers of inflammation including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and markers of oxidative stress including malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) by using standard methods.We stratified control and T2DM groups by 25(OH)D concentration and it indicates that in severe deficiency and sufficiency category IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL were significantly different while in moderate deficiency category only MDA was significantly different, among control and T2DM groups. In an insufficiency category, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, MDA, and Ox-LDL were significantly different among control and T2DM groups. Correlation analysis indicates a negative correlation of 25(OH)D with IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL among total subjects. Further, logistics regression analysis demonstrated a significant association of different categories of 25(OH)D with IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL before and after adjustment to body mass index and waist to hip ratio.This study suggest that vitamin D may have significant implications in the prevention of inflammation and oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019.

Furthermore, most people with type   are either obese or overweight, with the associated dyslipidaemia contributing to the development of insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk. Here we incubated INS-1 pancreatic β-cells for 72h in RPMI-1640 media, or media supplemented with 28mM glucose, 200µM palmitic acid, and 200µM oleic acid as a cellular model of diabetic glucolipotoxicity. Illumina HiSeq gene expression analysis showed the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) family to be among the most highly downregulated by glucolipotoxicity. Importantly, MetaCore integrated knowledge database, from Clarivate Analytics, indicated potential TAAR impact on insulin secretion through adenylyl cyclase signalling pathways. We therefore investigated the effect of TAAR ligands on cAMP signalling and insulin secretion, and found that only the branch of the TAAR family tree that is activated by isopentylamine, -phenylethylamine, p-tyramine, and agmatine significantly increased intracellular cAMP and resulted in increased insulin secretion from INS-1 cells and primary mouse islets under normal conditions. Crucially however, this enhancement was not evident when the receptor family was downregulated by glucolipotoxic conditions. This data indicates that a subset of TAARs are regulators of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, and that their downregulation contributes to glucolipotoxic inhibition of insulin secretion. As such they may be potential targets for treatment of type  .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated if the dietary minerals interact with the gut microbiota to alter circulating lipid profiles, implicated in CVD and metabolic syndrome.Plasma samples from Wistar rats fed a control or HNaLK diet with or without antibiotic treatment (n = 7 each, a total of 28) were subjected to lipidomics analysis. Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut microbiota and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster ) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster  TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster  TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, previously associated with reduced  risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

In genome-edited human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived β-like cells, we establish that the p.Arg138* allele results in reduced SLC30A8 expression due to haploinsufficiency. In human β cells, loss of SLC30A8 leads to increased glucose responsiveness and reduced K channel function similar to isolated islets from carriers of the T2D-protective allele p.Trp325.

It is recognised that the new definitions require validation in specific clinical settings and have yet to be universally adopted. We aim to validate new Sepsis-3 guidelines in acute hepatobiliary infection.A prospective cohort of patients admitted with acute hepatobiliary infection from the emergency department from July 2016 to June 2017 was studied. The Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, SOFA and qSOFA scores were calculated and predictive performance evaluated with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves for predictive ability of these indices for critical care unit admission and morbidity.124 patients with a median age of 64.5 years and majority males (n=75, 60.5%) were admitted with acute hepatobiliary infection during the study period. Acute cholecystitis was the most common admission diagnosis (n=83, 66.9%) and most patients were managed in general ward (n=91, 73.3%) with median length of stay of 6 days (range 1-40). On multivariate analysis,  (p=0.003) predicted high dependency unit (HDU) admission while age (p=0.001), blood culture (p=0.012), fluid culture (p=0.015) and SOFA score (p=0.002) predicted length of hospital stay. The sensitivity of SIRS in predicting HDU admission (60% vs. 4%), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (62.5% vs. 0%) and morbidity (66.7% vs. 0%) was higher than qSOFA score. The specificity of qSOFA in predicting HDU admission (100% vs. 49.5%), ICU admission (99.1% vs. 53.3%) and morbidity (99.% vs. 47.9%) was higher than SIRS criteria.The SIRS criteria has high sensitivity and the qSOFA score has high specificity in predicting outcomes of patients with acute hepatobiliary infection.Copyright © 2019.

Accumulating findings suggest that low-grade inflammation is a causative factor in T2DM and that circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines are associated with insulin resistance. However, inflammatory cytokine profiles and their correlations with T2DM development/ progression in  rats have not been studied. In this study, we found that the  rats had considerably high plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1α. Abundant cecal IL-1α mRNA expression and cecal inflammation with infiltrating IL-1α-producing macrophages was observed in  rats. Bone marrow derived macrophages from  rats expressed high levels of IL-1α upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Furthermore,  infection, which delays the onset of T2DM, reduced both plasma and cecal IL-1α levels in  rats. These results suggest that macrophage infiltration and IL-1α secretion comprise an important part of T2DM development and that  infection inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in  rats.© 2018 M.

In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms responsible for aggravating  after PM exposure, and study the roles of inflammatory factors in insulin-resistant type  . Our study indicated that short-time PM exposure enhances insulin resistance in type  diabetic rats and significantly raises inflammatory factors, including IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1, in lungs. However, we found that of these inflammatory factors only IL-6 levels are elevated in blood, liver, adipose tissue, and macrophages, but not in skeletal muscle. IL-6 induced activation of the STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in liver, but not other downstream pathways including STAT1, ERK1/, and PI3K. Both STAT3 inhibition and IL-6 neutralization effectively alleviated the disorders of glucose metabolism after PM exposure. Taken together, this suggests that the systemic increase in IL-6 may play an important role in the deterioration of the type   via IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in liver after short-time exposure to PM. Besides, we unexpectedly found a stronger resistance to the PM exposure-induced increase in IL-6 in skeleton muscle than those of many other tissues.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Military Cognitive and Brain Sciences.

We evaluated how the clinical phenotype of patients initiating GLP-1RA changed from 2010 to 2018.This was a retrospective study conducted at six  outpatient clinics in Northeast Italy. We collected data of T2D patients who initiated new GLP-1RA between 2010 and 2018. We recorded baseline characteristics, including demographics, anthropometrics, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose control, lipid profile, liver enzymes, renal function and concomitant medications. We recorded updated HbA1c and body weight at follow-up.There were 83,116 T2D patients from a general population of ~ 1,380,000 inhabitants. Among 6167 cases of GLP-1RA initiation, 5408 were analyzed after excluding intra-class switchers. Prescription of GLP-1RA increased exponentially, and the change in the type of GLP-1RA reflected waves of their entering the market. From 2010 to 2018, there were significant increases in baseline age,  duration and prevalence of male sex, of cardiovascular disease and of insulin users. Blood pressure and cholesterol levels decreased concomitantly with increasing use of medications for the control of cardiovascular risk. Baseline average HbA1c (8.3% [67 mmol/mol]) and BMI (34 kg/m) and their improvement after GLP-1RA initiation did not change over time.Despite the early positioning of GLP-1RA in T2D treatment algorithms, GLP-1RA have been prescribed in patients with progressively more advanced disease stage and especially in the presence of cardiovascular disease.

We aimed to assess the long-term survival of these patients and evaluate the association between vulnerable conditions (social, health behaviours, and comorbidities) and cause-specific mortality in a country with a high burden of tuberculosis.In this population-based, longitudinal study in São Paulo state, Brazil, we described the 5-year survival of patients who were newly diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2010. We included patients with newly-diagnosed tuberculosis, aged 15 years or older, and notified to the São Paulo State Tuberculosis Program in 2010. We excluded patients whose diagnosis had changed during follow-up (ie, they did not have tuberculosis) and patients who had multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. We selected our population with tuberculosis from the dedicated electronic system TBweb. Our primary objective was to estimate the excess mortality over 5 years and within the group who survived the first year, compared with the general São Paulo state population. We also estimated the association between social vulnerability (imprisonment and homelessness), health behaviours (alcohol and drug use), and comorbidities ( and mental disorders) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We used the competing risk analysis framework, estimating cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for potential confounding factors.In 2010, there were 19 252 notifications of tuberculosis cases. We excluded 550 cases as patients were younger than 15 years, 556 cases that were not tuberculosis, 2597 retreatments, and 48 cases of MDR tuberculosis, resulting in a final cohort of 15 501 patients with tuberculosis. Over a period of 5 years from tuberculosis diagnosis, 2660 (17%) of 15 501 patients died. Compared with the source population, matched by age, sex, and calendar year, the standardised mortality ratio was 6·47 (95% CI 6·22-6·73) over 5 years and 3·93 (3·71-4·17) among those who survived the first year. 1197 (45%) of 2660 deaths were due to infection. Homelessness and alcohol and drug use were associated with death from infection (adjusted cause-specific HR 1·60, 95% CI 1·39-1·85), cardiovascular (1·43, 1·06-1·95), and external or ill-defined causes of death (1·80, 1·37-·36).  was associated with deaths from cardiovascular causes (1·70, 1·23-·35).Patients newly diagnosed with tuberculosis were at a higher risk of death than were the source population, even after tuberculosis treatment.

It has been documented to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory actions. Our objective was to delineate the protective effect and the underlying mechanism of Saxa-in comparison with Dexamethasone (Dexa) - in airway inflammation induced by ovalbumin (OVA) in mice.Mice were OVA-sensitized and challenged for the induction of acute asthma. Mice were orally administrated Saxa or Dexa. Total and differential cell counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total protein concentrations were assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), reduced glutathione (GSH), and total nitrate/nitrite products (NOx) levels as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissues were measured. Histopathological examination of the lung specimens was carried out using the hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining.Histopathological examination revealed that both Saxa and Dexa ameliorated OVA-induced inflammatory changes and significantly reduced total and differential leukocyte counts, LDH and total protein level in BALF upon comparison with OVA group. In addition, both treatments significantly mitigated OVA-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by diminished lung NOx level and MPO activity and elevated GSH level. The elevation of TLR4 and NF-kB levels in lung tissue were ameliorated by Saxa and Dexa administration.Saxa had marked antiasthmatic effect in OVA-induced allergic asthma through modulation of TLR4 and NF-κB signaling.

In the present work, we established a facile, sensitive and selective fluorescence method based on silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) and MnO2 nanosheets for the determination of α-glucosidase and one of its inhibitors acarbose. The fluorescence of SiQDs was greatly quenched by MnO2 nanosheets due to the inner filter effect. α-Glucosidase could easily catalyze the hydrolysis of l-ascorbic acid--O-α-d-glucopyranosyl (AAG) to produce ascorbic acid (AA), which could reduce MnO2 nanosheets to Mn2+, resulting in dramatic recovery of the fluorescence of SiQDs. The proposed sensing platform could provide a good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity of SiQDs and the concentration of α-glucosidase in the range of 0.02-.5 U mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.007 U mL-1. In addition, the sensing platform could be used for α-glucosidase inhibition. Acarbose was one of the most common and typical inhibitors, and this sensing platform can be utilized to detect acarbose in the range of 1-1000 μM.

Patients were followed up for 12 months. Events were independently adjudicated by three experienced cardiologists. Participants were recruited from four tertiary hospitals in Switzerland: Zurich, Geneva, Lausanne and Bern. Participants presenting with acute coronary syndromes and who underwent coronary angiography were included in the analysis. Patients were grouped according to history of  (or HbA1c greater than 6%), baseline blood sugar level (BSL; < 6, 6-11.1 and > 11.1 mmol/L) and body mass index (BMI). The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) which was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke and all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary endpoint, revascularisations, bleeding events (BARC classification) and cerebrovascular events (ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke or TIA).Patients with hyperglycemia, i.e. BSL ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, had higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine kinase (CK), higher heart rates and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and increased N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. At 30 days and 12 months, those with BSL ≥ 11.1 mmol/L had more MACE and death compared to those with BSL < 6.0 mmol/L or 6.0-11.1 mmol/L (HR-ratio 4.78 and 6.6; p < 0.001). The novel biomarker Cyr61 strongly associated with high BSL and STEMI and was independently associated with 1 year outcomes (HR .22; 95% CI 1.33-3.72; Tertile 3 vs. Tertile 1).In this large, prospective, independently adjudicated cohort of in all comers ACS patients undergoing PCI, both a history of  and elevated entry glucose was associated with inflammation and increased risk of MACE both at short and long-term. The mediators might involve increased sympathetic activation, inflammation and ischemia as reflected by elevated Cyr61 levels leading to larger levels of troponin and lower LVEF.

The reliability of EGS and AGD's were determined by the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Cross-sectional data were obtained in 686 term (0-24 months), and 181 preterm babies and 111 babies with atypical genitalia.ICC of EGS in typical and atypical genitalia is excellent and good. Median EGS (10th - 90th centile) in males < 28 weeks gestation is 10 (8.6-11.5); in males 28-32 weeks 11.5 (9.-12); in males 33-36 weeks 11.5 (10.5-12) and in full-term males 12 (10.5-12). In all female babies, EGS is 0 (0-0). The mean (SD) AGDl/u is 0.45 (0.1), with significant difference between AGDl/u in males 0.49 (0.1) and females 0.39 (0.1) and in-between values in DSD 0.43 (0.1). AGDl/u correlates with EGS in males with typical genitalia and in atypical genitalia.EGS is a reliable and valid tool to describe external genitalia in premature and term babies up to 24 months. EGS correlates with AGDl/u in males. It facilitates standardized assessment, clinical decision-making and multicenter research.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

However, metformin safety in elderly individuals is unknown. The aim of this study was to identify frequency and risk factors of lactic acid (LA) elevation in ambulatory elderly male US veterans with stable diabetic CKD3 treated with metformin. We studied 92 patients with non-diabetic CKD3 (Group1), diabetic CKD3 not on metformin (Group2) and diabetic CKD3 on metformin (Group 3). Mean LA levels were similar at 1.3 ± 0.3 and 1.3 ± 0.4 mmol/L in Groups 1 and , respectively; while, LA was significantly higher in Group 3 (.1 ± 1.0 mmol/L, P < .001). Only 1 patient in each Groups 1 (4%) and  (4%) had hyperlactatemia (LA > .0 mmol/L), as compared with 17 (42.5%) patients in Group 3 (P < .05). No differences in age, BMI, eGFR, metformin dosage, and HbA1c were seen in Group 3 patients with and without hyperlactatemia. In the multivariate logistic regression analyses, metformin use was the only factor significantly associated with hyperlactatemia (adjusted OR 25.48, P < .005).

The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of faster aspart have been characterised in clinical pharmacology trials with comparable overall methodology. In subjects with type 1 (T1D) or type  (T2D) , the serum IAsp concentration-time and glucose-lowering effect profiles are left-shifted for faster aspart compared with IAsp. In addition, faster aspart provides earlier onset, doubling of initial exposure, and an up to .5-fold increase in initial glucose-lowering effect within 30 min of subcutaneous injection, as well as earlier offset of exposure and effect. Similar results have been shown using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). The improved pharmacological properties of faster aspart versus IAsp are consistent across populations, i.e. in the elderly, children, adolescents and the Japanese. Thus, the faster aspart pharmacological characteristics more closely resemble the mealtime insulin secretion in healthy individuals, giving faster aspart the potential to further improve postprandial glucose control in subjects with . Indeed, change from baseline in 1-h postprandial glucose increment is in favour of faster aspart versus IAsp when used as basal-bolus or CSII treatment in phase III trials in subjects with T1D or T2D.

Plasma VitD levels were measured in the first (T1) and/or second trimester (T2). Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used for evaluating the association of VitD with GDM.Prepregnancy BMI was positively associated with all three time-point glucose of OGTT. 25(OH)D level in T1 (β = -0.003) and T2 (β = -0.004), and its change from T1 to T2 (β = -0.004) were significantly and inversely associated with fasting blood glucose (FBG) of OGTT, but not 1-h and -h postload blood glucose of OGTT, respectively. The negative associations of VitD and FBG were stronger among overweight/obese women. VitD deficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml) in T2 was associated with an increased risk of GDM with increased FBG, GDM subtype 1 (OR: .10) and subtype 3 (OR: .19). Moreover, prepregnancy BMI modified this effect on GDM subtype 1 (BMI < 24: OR = 1.42; BMI ≥ 24: OR = 9.61, P for interaction = 0.002). Lower VitD increment from T1 to T2 was associated with a higher risk for GDM among overweight/obese women. Additionally, GDM prevalence fluctuated with the season, i.e. lower in summer/fall and higher in winter/spring.Maternal VitD deficiency was associated with a higher risk of GDM subtype with increased FBG, and the risk is much greater among overweight/obesity women. The lower the VitD increment during pregnancy, the greater the risk of GDM, especially in overweight/obesity women. Furthermore, seasonal variation of GDM may be exhibited as a critical confounder in the association of VitD and GDM.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Expression of FFAR4 was assessed by qPCR and western blotting following agonist treatment in BRIN-BD11 cells and by immunohistochemistry in mouse islets. Acute in-vivo effects of agonists was investigated after intraperitoneal (i.p.) or oral administration in lean and HFF-obese diabetic mice.GSK137647 (10-10 M) and Compound-A (10-10 M) stimulated insulin secretion at 5.6mM (p<0.05-p<0.001) and 16.7mM (p<0.05-p<0.001) glucose in BRIN-BD11 cells, with no cytotoxicity effects as assessed by MTT. FFAR4 antagonist (AH-7614) abolished the insulintropic effect of GSK137647 (p<0.05-p<0.001), whilst FFAR1 antagonist (GW1100) had no effect. Incubation of BRIN-BD11 cells with GSK137647 and Compound-A increased FFAR4 (p<0.01) gene expression at 16.7 mM glucose, with a corresponding increase in FFAR4 (p<0.01) protein concentrations. FFAR4 upregulation was attenuated under normoglycaemic conditions. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated co-localisation of FFAR4 and insulin in mouse islets.

In healthy humans, high Hcy levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, stroke and type  . A recent study reports that Hcy reacts with Cys of transthyretin (TTR), generating a stable covalent adduct. However, to date the effect of S-homocysteinylation on TTR conformational stability remains unknown.The effect of Hcy on the conformational properties of wt- and L55P-TTR were analysed using a set of biophysical techniques. The cytotoxicity of S-homocysteinylated L55P-TTR was also evaluated in the HL-1 cardiomyocyte cell line, while the effects of the assemblies on kinematic and dynamics properties of cardiac muscle cells were analysed in cardiomyocyte syncytia.We found that Hcy stabilizes tetrameric wt-TTR, while it destabilizes the tetrameric structure of the L55P mutant, promoting the accumulation of self-assembly-prone monomeric species.Our study demonstrated that S-homocysteinylation of the L55P-TTR mutant impairs protein stability, favouring the appearance of toxic monomers. Interestingly, S-homocysteinylation affected only mutant, not wt-TTR. Moreover, we also show that assemblies of S-homocysteinylated L55P-TTR impair cardiomyocytes functional parameters.Our study offers new insights on the negative impact of S-homocysteinylation on L55P-TTR stability, whose aggregation is considered the causative agent of a form of early-onset familial amyloid polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Our results suggest that high homocysteine levels are a further risk factor for TTR cardiomyopathy in patients harbouring the L55P-TTR mutation.Copyright © 2019.

The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of perinatal depressive symptoms in a national sample of women in Israel, and to investigate associations of these symptoms with demographic, medical and lifestyle factors.The study included all members of Maccabi Health Services, the second largest health maintenance organization in Israel, who filled the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during 2015-2016. Crude odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted ORs (aORs) are presented for associations of sociodemographic, medical and lifestyle factors with perinatal depressive symptoms, according to a score ≥ 10 on the EPDS.Of 27,520 women who filled the EPDS, 1346 (4.9%) met the criteria for perinatal depression.

This study sought to utilize the MBASQIP® Data Registry to analyze the impact of age at time of surgery on outcomes following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures.The MBSAQIP® Data Registry for patients undergoing SG or RYGB procedures between 2015 and 2016 was reviewed. Patients were divided into 4 age groups [18-44; 45-54; 55-64; > 65 years]. Minimal exclusions for revisional and/or emergency surgery were selected and combination variables created to classify complications as major or minor. A comorbidity index was constructed to include , gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and prior cardiac surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare age stratifications to the young adult (18-45 years) cohort.Of 301,605 cases, 279,419 cases (71.% SG) remained after applying exclusion criteria (79.% female, mean BMI 45.5 ± 8.1 kg/m, 8.9% insulin-dependent diabetics). Mean age was 44.7 ± 12.0 years (51.3% 18-44 years; 26.9% 45-54 years; 16.3% 55-64 years; 5.5% > 65 years). A univariate analysis demonstrated preoperative differences of lower BMI with increasing age concomitant with increasing frequency of RYGB and a higher comorbidity index (p < 0.0001 vs. 18-45 years). At age > 45 years, major complications and 30-day mortality increased independent of procedure type (p < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis controlling for comorbidity indices demonstrated increasing age (> 45 years) increased risk for major complications and mortality.Overall, bariatric surgery (SG or RYGB) remains a low mortality risk procedure for all age groups. However, all age group classifications > 45 years had higher incidence of major complications and mortality compared to patients 18-45 years (despite older individuals having lower preoperative BMI) indicating delaying surgery is detrimental.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680138></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665349>Exposure to glucocorticoids in the first part of fetal life is associated with insulin secretory defect in adult human.</a></h2><p>We have shown in rodents that high glucocorticoid levels inhibit development of beta-cells during fetal life and lead to insulin deficiency in adulthood. To test whether similar phenomena occur in humans, we compared beta-cell function in adult subjects previously exposed to glucocorticoids during first part of fetal life to non-exposed subjects.The study was conducted in 16 adult participants exposed to glucocorticoids during the first part of fetal life and in 16 non-exposed healthy subjects with normal glucose tolerance matched for age, sex, and BMI. Exposed subjects were descendants from mother at risk of having a child with 21-hydroxylase deficiency that were consequently treated by dexamethasone (1 to 1.5mg/day from the 6th gestational week (GW) to prevent genital virilization. We selected descendant of mother who stopped dexamethasone before the 18th GW following negative genotyping of the fetus. Insulin and glucagon secretion were measured during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), graded intravenous (IV) glucose and arginine test. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycaemic-clamp.Age, BMI and anthropometric characteristics were similar in the  groups. Insulinogenic index during OGTT and insulin-sensitivity during the clamp were similar in the  groups. In exposed subjects, insulin secretion during graded IV-glucose infusion and after arginine administration decreased by 17% (p=0.02) and 22% (p=0.002) respectively while Glucagon secretion after arginine increased.Over exposure to glucocorticoids during first part of fetal life is associated with lower insulin secretion at adult age, which may lead to abnormal glucose tolerance later in life.© Endocrine Society 2019.

However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter  (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice.Wilt-type mice fed with low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25 days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed.In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf-b in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio.Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF-B expression in PVAT. Inhibition of PVAT remodeling by luseogliflozin may be a novel therapeutic target for vascular remodeling after angioplasty.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves lipid and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of lipid metabolism in obese patients with no overt type  : a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type   at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without .

Four previous studies in U.S have found that higher DD scores were associated with worse psychological outcomes, lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and increased risk of T2DM complications. In this study, we aimed to firstly compare DD scores in Indonesian T2DM outpatients treated in primary care versus those in tertiary care. Subsequently, we investigated whether socio-demographic characteristics and clinical conditions explain potential differences in DD score across healthcare settings.A cross-sectional study was conducted on Java island in three primary care (n = 108) and four tertiary care (n = 524) facilities. The participants completed the Bahasa Indonesia version of the  Distress Scale questionnaire (DDS17 Bahasa Indonesia). Ordinal regression analysis was conducted with the quartile of the summation of the DD score as the dependent variable to investigate how the association between the level of healthcare facilities and DD altered when adding different variables in the model.The final adjusted model showed that the level of healthcare facilities was strongly associated with DD (p < .001), with participants in primary care having a 3.68 times (95% CI .46-5.55) higher likelihood of being more distressed than the participants in tertiary care. This association was detected after including the socio-demographic characteristics and clinical conditions as model confounders.This is the first study in Indonesia to compare DD scores within different healthcare facilities.
