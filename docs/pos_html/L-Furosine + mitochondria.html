Porcine oocytes collected from the ovaries of slaughtered landrace gilts were subjected to the process of in vitro maturation. Transcriptomic changes in the expression profile of oocyte genes involved in response to hypoxia, the transmembrane protein receptor serine threonine kinase signaling pathway, the "transforming growth factor β receptor signaling pathway", "response to protein stimulus", and "response to organic substance" were investigated using microarrays. The expression values of these genes in oocytes was analyzed before (immature) and after (mature) in vitro maturation, with significant differences found. All the significantly altered genes showed downregulation after the maturation process. The most changed genes from these gene ontologies, , , , , , , , , , , were chosen to be further validated, described and related to the literature. Additionally, the mitochondrial activity of the analyzed oocytes was measured using specific dyes. We found that the mitochondrial activity was higher before the maturation process. The analysis of these results and the available literature provides a novel insight on the processes that occur during in vitro oocyte maturation. While this knowledge may prove to be useful in further research of the procedures commonly associated with in vitro fertilization procedures, it serves mostly as a basic reference for further proteomic, in vivo, and clinical studies that are necessary to translate it into practical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29682179>Antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins determine sorafenib/regorafenib resistance and BH3-mimetic efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Sorafenib, systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and regorafenib, novel second line treatment after sorafenib failure, have efficacy limited by evasive mechanisms of acquired-drug resistance. BCL-2 proteins participate in the response to  kinase inhibitors; however, their role in HCC therapy with sorafenib/regorafenib remains uncertain. BH3-mimetic ABT-263 (navitoclax) enhanced sorafenib activity, inducing cell death via a mitochondrial caspase-dependent mechanism, after BCL-xL/BCL-2 inhibition. Sorafenib-resistant hepatoma cells (HepG2R and Hep3BR) exhibited altered mRNA expression of BCL-2 and other anti-apoptotic family members, such as MCL-1, priming drug-resistant cancer cells to death by BH3-mimetics. ABT-263 restored sorafenib efficacy in sorafenib-resistant cell lines and HCC mouse models. Moreover, in mice xenografts from patient-derived BCLC9 cells, better tumor response to sorafenib was associated to higher changes in the BCL-2 mRNA pattern. HCC non-treated patients displayed altered BCL-2, MCL-1 and BCL-xL mRNA levels respect to adjacent non-tumoral biopsies and an increased BCL-2/MCL-1 ratio, predictive of navitoclax efficacy. Moreover, regorafenib administration also modified the BCL-2/MCL-1 ratio and navitoclax sensitized hepatoma cells to regorafenib by a mitochondrial caspase-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, sorafenib/regorafenib response is determined by BCL-2 proteins, while increased BCL-2/MCL-1 ratio in HCC sensitizes drug resistant-tumors against ABT-263 co-administration. Thus, changes in the BCL-2 profile, altered in HCC patients, could help to follow-up sorafenib efficacy, allowing patient selection for combined therapy with BH3-mimetics or early switch them to second line therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30990365>Mitigation of cocaine-mediated mitochondrial damage, defective mitophagy and microglial activation by superoxide dismutase mimetics.</a></h2><p>Although cocaine exposure has been shown to potentiate neuroinflammation by upregulating glial activation in the brain, the role of mitophagy in this process remains an enigma. In the present study, we sought to examine the role of impaired mitophagy in cocaine-mediated activation of microglia and to determine the ameliorative potential of superoxide dismutase mimetics in this context. Our findings demonstrated that exposure of mouse primary microglial cells (mPMs) to cocaine resulted in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, that was accompanied by increased expression of mitophagy markers, PINK1 and PRKN. Exposure of microglia to cocaine also resulted in increased expression of DNM1L and OPTN with a concomitant decrease in the rate of mitochondrial oxygen consumption as well as impaired mitochondrial functioning. Additionally, in the presence of cocaine, microglia also exhibited upregulated expression of autophagosome markers, BECN1, MAP1LC3B-II, and SQSTM1. Taken together, these findings suggested diminished mitophagy flux and accumulation of mitophagosomes in the presence of cocaine. These findings were further confirmed by imaging techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. Cocaine-mediated activation of microglia was further monitored by assessing the expression of the microglial marker (ITGAM) and the inflammatory cytokine (Tnf, Il1b, and Il6) mRNAs. Pharmacological, as well as gene-silencing approaches aimed at blocking both the autophagy/mitophagy and SIGMAR1 expression, underscored the role of impaired mitophagy in cocaine-mediated activation of microglia. Furthermore, superoxide dismutase mimetics such as TEMPOL and MitoTEMPO were shown to alleviate cocaine-mediated impaired mitophagy as well as microglial activation.

However, not all people benefit from this drug. Our aim was to investigate the effects of metformin on the plasma metabolome and whether the pretreatment metabolite profile can predict HbA outcome.Post hoc analysis of the Copenhagen Insulin and Metformin Therapy (CIMT) trial, a multicentre study from May 2008 to December 2012, was carried out. We used a non-target method to analyse 87 plasma metabolites in participants with Type 2 diabetes (n = 370) who were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to 18 months of metformin or placebo treatment. Metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry at baseline and at 18-month follow-up and the data were analysed using a linear mixed-effect model.At baseline, participants who were on metformin before the trial (n = 312) had higher levels of leucine/isoleucine and five lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs), and lower levels of carnitine and valine compared with metformin-naïve participants (n = 58). At follow-up, participants randomized to metformin (n = 188) had elevated levels of leucine/isoleucine and reduced carnitine,  and valine compared with placebo (n = 182). At baseline, participants on metformin treatment with the highest levels of carnitine C10:1 and leucine/isoleucine had the lowest HbA (P-interaction = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). This association was not significant with HbA at follow-up.Metformin treatment is associated with decreased levels of valine,  and carnitine, and increased levels of leucine/isoleucine. None of the identified metabolites can predict the HbA -lowering effect of metformin. Further studies of the association between metformin, carnitine and leucine/isoleucine are warranted.© 2018 Diabetes UK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29269267>Complex II phosphorylation is triggered by unbalanced redox homeostasis in cells lacking complex III.</a></h2><p>A marked stimulation of complex II enzymatic activity was detected in cybrids bearing a homoplasmic MTCYB microdeletion causing disruption of both the activity and the assembly of complex III, but not in cybrids harbouring another MTCYB mutation affecting only the complex III activity. Moreover, complex II stimulation was associated with SDHA subunit  phosphorylation. Despite the lack of detectable hydrogen peroxide production, up-regulation of the levels of mitochondrial antioxidant defenses revealed a significant redox unbalance. This effect was also supported by the finding that treatment with N-acetylcysteine dampened the complex II stimulation, SDHA subunit  phosphorylation, and levels of antioxidant enzymes. In the absence of complex III, the cellular amount of succinate, but not fumarate, was markedly increased, indicating that enhanced activity of complex II is hampered due to the blockage of respiratory electron flow. Thus, we propose that complex II phosphorylation and stimulation of its activity represent a molecular mechanism triggered by perturbation of mitochondrial redox homeostasis due to severe dysfunction of respiratory complexes. Depending on the site and nature of the damage, complex II stimulation can either bypass the energetic deficit as an efficient compensatory mechanism, or be ineffectual, leaving cells to rely on glycolysis for survival.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although deficiencies in brain insulin and IGF could be ameliorated with trophic factors such as insulin, impairments in receptor expression, binding, and  kinase activation require alternative strategies. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists target genes downstream of insulin/IGF stimulation. Furthermore, their anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects address other pathologies contributing to neurodegeneration.The goal of this research was to examine effects of dual delivery of L165, 041 (PPAR-δ) and F-L-Leu (PPAR-γ) agonists for remediating in the early stages of neurodegeneration.Experiments were conducted using frontal lobe slice cultures from an intracerebral Streptozotocin (i.c. STZ) rat model of AD.PPAR-δ+ PPAR-γ agonist treatments increased indices of neuronal and myelin maturation, and mitochondrial proliferation and function, and decreased neuroinflammation, AβPP-Aβ, neurotoxicity, ubiquitin, and nitrosative stress, but failed to restore choline acetyl transferase expression and adversely increased HNE(lipid peroxidation) and acetylcholinesterase, which would have further increased stress and reduced cholinergic function in the STZ brain cultures.PPAR-δ + PPAR-γ agonist treatments have substantial positive early therapeutic targeting effects on AD-associated molecular and biochemical brain pathologies. However, additional or alternative strategies may be needed to optimize disease remediation during the initial phases of treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29080681>Uncoupling of ER/Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress in mTORC1 Hyperactivation-Associated Skin Hypopigmentation.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence has described the involvement of mTORC1 signaling in pigmentation regulation; however, the precise mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we generated mice with conditional deletion of the mTORC1 suppressor Tsc2 in melanocytes. It resulted in constitutive hyperactivation of mTORC1 and reduced skin pigmentation. Mechanistically, neither the number of melanocytes nor the expression of melanogenesis-related enzymes was decreased; however, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial oxidative stress and lower melanization in melanosomes were observed. By contrast, abrogation of mTORC1 by rapamycin completely reversed the reduced pigmentation, and alleviation of endoplasmic reticulum stress by SMER28 or 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) or alleviation of mitochondrial oxidative stress by administration of adenosine triphosphate partially reversed the reduced pigmentation in these mice. In addition, we showed that these mechanisms were involved in reduced pigmentation of TSC2 small interfering RNA-transfected cultured human primary melanocytes and skin lesions of patients with the TSC gene mutation.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

This dopamine derived molecule induces formation and stabilization of alpha-synuclein oligomers,  dysfunction, oxidative stress, dysfunction of proteasomal and lysosomal systems, endoplasmic reticulum stress and disruption of the microtubule network, but until now there has been no evidence of effects on production of cytokines and neurotrophic factors, that are mechanisms involved in neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study examines the potential role of aminochrome on the regulation of NGF, GDNF, TNF-α and IL-1β production and microglial activation in organotypic midbrain slice cultures from P8 - P9 Wistar rats. We demonstrated aminochrome (25 μM, for 24 h) induced reduction of GFAP expression, reduction of NGF and GDNF mRNA levels, morphological changes in Iba1 cells, and increase of both TNF-α, IL-1β mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, aminochrome (25 μM, for 48 h) induced morphological changes in the edge of slices and reduction of TH expression. These results demonstrate neuroinflammation, as well as negative regulation of neurotrophic factors (GDNF and NGF), may be involved in aminochrome-induced neurodegeneration, and they contribute to a better understanding of PD pathogenesis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has shown neuroprotective effects in other experimental models of Parkinson's disease, but its effect on the rotenone-induced parkinsonism is still unknown. We tested whether DHA in vivo exerts a neuroprotective effect on rotenone-induced parkinsonism and explored the mechanisms involved, including mitochondrial function and ultrastructure as well as the expression of tubulin and synaptophysin. We pretreated eighty male Wistar rats with DHA (35 mg/kg/day) for seven days and then administered rotenone for eight days. We then measured rearing behavior, number of dopaminergic neurons,  hydroxylase content, tubulin and synaptophysin expression, mitochondrial complex I, respiratory control ratio, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, ATP production activity and mitochondrial ultrastructure. We found that in vivo DHA supply exerted a neuroprotective effect, evidenced by decreased dopaminergic neuron cell death. Although we detected rotenone induced mitochondrial ultrastructure alterations, these were not associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Rotenone had no effect on mitochondrial complex I, respiratory control ratio, mitochondrial transmembrane potential or ATP production activity. DHA also prevented a rotenone-induced decrease in tubulin and synaptophysin expression. Our results support the neuroprotective effect of DHA on rotenone-induced parkinsonism, and a possible effect on early stage Parkinson's disease. This protective effect is not associated with mitochondrial function improvement, but rather with preventing loss of tubulin and synaptophysin, proteins relevant to synaptic transmission.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are currently no clinically effective drugs for the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with PD. Previous studies have suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction such as decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production triggers dopaminergic neurodegeneration in patients with PD and that  represent a potential target for the development of novel treatments for preventing PD. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the cognition-enhancing effects of ethyl pyruvate (EP) and 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl) piperazine dihydrochloride (SA4503) in mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinsonism. PD model mice were generated via treatment with MPTP (25 mg/kg, i.p.) once a day for 5 consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the final injection of MPTP, mice were intraperitoneally injected with EP (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) or SA4503 (1 mg/kg) once a day for 4 weeks. Chronic administration of EP (100 mg/kg i.p.) or SA4503 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) improved both motor deficits and cognitive impairments in MPTP-treated mice. Furthermore, treatment with EP or SA4503 attenuated decreases in the levels of ATP and  hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc)/ventral tegmental area (VTA), striatum, and hippocampal CA1 region. Administration of EP or SA4503 protected the dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-induce toxicity and restored the dopamine levels in the striatum. Elevated 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal- (4-HNE-) and nitrotyrosine-reactive protein levels induced by MPTP-treatment were suppressed by EP or SA4503 treatment in the SNpc-VTA, striatum, and hippocampal CA1 region. These observations suggest that EP and SA4503 attenuate cognitive impairments and motor dysfunction in mice with MPTP-induced PD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Plasma-activated medium (PAM), which is prepared by the irradiation of culture medium with NTP, induces cell death in cancer cells. However, difficulties are associated with applying PAM to the clinical phase because culture media cannot be used for medical treatments. The objectives of the present study were to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of plasma-activated lactated Ringer's solution (PAL) on the viability of the A549 cancer cell line and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The anti-tumor activity of PAL was significantly stronger than that of PAM, whereas their concentrations of HO and nitrite were similar. Lactated Ringer's solution (Lac-R) consists of lactate and three types of inorganic salts. The results showing that NTP irradiation of the lactate solution rather than the inorganic salt solution induced the inactivation of catalase were dependent on the presence or absence of nitrite in these solutions. We detected nitrotyrosine in A549 cells treated with PAM or PAL, and the addition of catalase to PAM rather than to PAL reduced its production. The PAL treatment of A549 cells led to mitochondrial dysfunction with the down-regulation of NF-κB-Bcl signaling.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is limited information about mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from these species. As mitochondrial genetics has been fundamental for posing evolutionary hypotheses and identifying taxonomical markers, in this study we sequenced the first sabethine mitogenomes: Sabethes undosus, Trichoprosopon pallidiventer, Runchomyia reversa, Limatus flavisetosus, and Wyeomyia confusa. In addition, we performed phylogenetic analyses of Sabethini within Culicidae and compared its mitogenomic architecture to that of other insects.Similar to other insects, the Sabethini mitogenome contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and a control region. However, the gene order is not the same as that in other mosquitoes; the  (Y) and cysteine (C) tRNA genes have translocated. In general, mitogenome rearrangements within insects are uncommon events; the translocation reported here is unparalleled among Culicidae and can be considered an autapomorphy for the Neotropical sabethines.Our study provides clear evidence of gene rearrangements in the mitogenomes of these Neotropical genera in the tribe Sabethini. Gene order can be informative at the taxonomic level of tribe. The translocations found, along with the mitogenomic sequence data and other recently published findings, reinforce the status of Sabethini as a well-supported monophyletic taxon. Furthermore, T. pallidiventer was recovered as sister to R. reversa, and both were placed as sisters of other Sabethini genera (Sabethes, Wyeomyia, and Limatus).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463472>Interferon Gamma Induces Reversible Metabolic Reprogramming of M1 Macrophages to Sustain Cell Viability and Pro-Inflammatory Activity.</a></h2><p>Classical activation of M1 macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is associated with a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. However, the generalizability of such metabolic remodeling to other modes of M1 macrophage stimulation, e.g. type II interferons (IFNs) such as IFNγ, has remained unknown as has the functional significance of aerobic glycolysis during macrophage activation. Here we demonstrate that IFNγ induces a rapid activation of aerobic glycolysis followed by a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation in M1 macrophages. Elevated glycolytic flux sustains cell viability and inflammatory activity, while limiting reliance on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) distributed by aerobic glycolysis is critical for sustaining IFN-γ triggered JAK (Janus  kinase)-STAT-1 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1) signaling with phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT-1 as its signature trait. Inhibition of aerobic glycolysis not only blocks the M1 phenotype and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in murine macrophages and also human monocytes/macrophages. These findings extend on the potential functional role of immuno-metabolism from LPS- to IFNγ-linked diseases such as atherosclerosis and autoimmune disease.Copyright © 2018 German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE).

Endorepellin is the C-terminal angiostatic fragment of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan and induces autophagy in endothelial cells. To further investigate this property, we used NanoString, a digital PCR platform for measuring pre-defined transcripts in biological samples to analyze a custom subset of 95 autophagy-related genes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with ultrapure human recombinant endorepellin. We discovered an endorepellin-evoked pro-autophagic and pro-mitophagic gene expression signatures, which included two coordinately up-regulated mitochondrial-associated genes encoding the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase Parkin and the tumor suppressor mitostatin. Induction of both proteins required the  kinase activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Furthermore, we discovered that endorepellin evoked mitochondrial depolarization in endothelial cells via a specific interaction between its two proximal LG1/2 domains and VEGFR2. We also found that following loss of membrane potential, mitostatin and parkin interact and that mitostatin associates with the established Parkin receptor mitofusin-2. In conclusion, we have identified a critical role for endorepellin in remodeling the autophagic transcriptome and influencing mitochondrial homeostasis.© 2018 Neill et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29563880>Antineoplastic Drug-Induced Cardiotoxicity: A Redox Perspective.</a></h2><p>Antineoplastic drugs can be associated with several side effects, including cardiovascular toxicity (CTX). Biochemical studies have identified multiple mechanisms of CTX. Chemoterapeutic agents can alter redox homeostasis by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species RNS.

Understanding the mechanisms of CTX is fundamental for effective cardioprotection, without compromising the efficacy of anticancer treatments. Type 1 CTX is associated with irreversible cardiac cell injury and is typically caused by anthracyclines and conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Type 2 CTX, associated with reversible myocardial dysfunction, is generally caused by biologicals and targeted drugs. Although oxidative/nitrosative reactions play a central role in CTX caused by different antineoplastic drugs, additional mechanisms involving directly and indirectly cardiomyocytes and inflammatory cells play a role in cardiovascular toxicities. Identification of cardiologic risk factors and an integrated approach using molecular, imaging, and clinical data may allow the selection of patients at risk of developing chemotherapy-related CTX. Although the last decade has witnessed intense research related to the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of CTX of antineoplastic drugs, experimental and clinical studies are urgently needed to balance safety and efficacy of novel cancer therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660504>IDH2 deficiency accelerates skin pigmentation in mice via enhancing melanogenesis.</a></h2><p>Melanogenesis is a complex biosynthetic pathway regulated by multiple agents, which are involved in the production, transport, and release of melanin. Melanin has diverse roles, including determination of visible skin color and photoprotection. Studies indicate that melanin synthesis is tightly linked to the interaction between melanocytes and keratinocytes. α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is known as a trigger that enhances melanin biosynthesis in melanocytes through paracrine effects. Accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in skin affects both keratinocytes and melanocytes by causing DNA damage, which eventually leads to the stimulation of α-MSH production.  are one of the main sources of ROS in the skin and play a central role in modulating redox-dependent cellular processes such as metabolism and apoptosis. Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction may serve as a key for the pathogenesis of skin melanogenesis. Mitochondrial NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) is a key enzyme that regulates mitochondrial redox balance and reduces oxidative stress-induced cell injury through the generation of NADPH. Downregulation of IDH2 expression resulted in an increase in oxidative DNA damage in mice skin through ROS-dependent ATM-mediated p53 signaling. IDH2 deficiency also promoted pigmentation on the dorsal skin of mice, as evident from the elevated levels of melanin synthesis markers. Furthermore, pretreatment with -targeted antioxidant mito-TEMPO alleviated oxidative DNA damage and melanogenesis induced by IDH2 deficiency both in vitro and in vivo. Together, our findings highlight the role of IDH2 in skin melanogenesis in association with mitochondrial ROS and suggest unique therapeutic strategies for the prevention of skin pigmentation.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

This study aimed to characterize the lipid metabolism alterations and the molecular mediators which are related to lipid metabolism in liver under the heavy ethanol exposure alone or combined with ginger extract. Twenty-four male wistar rats were assigned into three groups, namely control, ethanol, and ginger extract treated ethanol (GETE) groups. Six weeks after the treatment, the ethanol group showed a significant increase in fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and decrease hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 Alpha (HNF4A) genes expressions compared to the control group. The ethanol administration also significantly increased plasma LDL, cholesterol, triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) compared to the control group. Moreover, compared to the control group, the ethanol group showed liver histhological changes, such as fibrosis, focal microvesicular steatosis, some apoptotic hepatocytes, spotty necrosis, portal lymphocytic inflammation, mallory-denk bodies, giant , piecemeal necrosis. Consumption of ginger extract along with ethanol, partially ameliorated gene expression alteration and histological changes, improved undesirable lipid profile and liver enzymes changes compare to those in the ethanol group. These findings indicate that ethanol-induced liver abnormalities may in part be associated with lipid homeostasis changes mediated by overexpression of FAT/CD36, PTP1B and downexpressionof HNF4A genes.

Peroxynitrite-induced nitrosative stress has emerged as a major cause of impaired sperm function; however, its ability to trigger cell death has not been described in human spermatozoa. The objective here was to characterize biochemical and morphological features of cell death induced by peroxynitrite-mediated nitrosative stress in human spermatozoa. For this, spermatozoa were incubated with and without (untreated control) 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), in order to generate peroxynitrite. Sperm viability, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), externalization of phosphatidylserine, DNA oxidation and fragmentation, caspase activation,  nitration, and sperm ultrastructure were analyzed. The results showed that at 24 h of incubation with SIN-1, the sperm viability was significantly reduced compared to untreated control (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the MPT was induced (P < 0.01) and increment in DNA oxidation (P < 0.01), DNA fragmentation (P < 0.01),  nitration (P < 0.0001) and ultrastructural damage were observed when compared to untreated control. Caspase activation was not evidenced, and although phosphatidylserine externalization increased compared to untreated control (P < 0.001), this process was observed in <10% of the cells and the gradual loss of viability was not characterized by an important increase in this parameter. In conclusion, peroxynitrite-mediated nitrosative stress induces the regulated variant of cell death known as MPT-driven necrosis in human spermatozoa. This study provides a new insight into the pathophysiology of nitrosative stress in human spermatozoa and opens up a new focus for developing specific therapeutic strategies to better preserve sperm viability or to avoid cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30234969>Nucleus and  Targeting Theranostic Plasmonic Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Nanoprobes as a Means for Revealing Molecular Stress Response Differences in Hyperthermia Cell Death between Cancerous and Normal Cells.</a></h2><p>Metallic plasmonic nanoparticles have been intensively exploited as theranostic nanoprobes for plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPT) and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) applications.

And from the  point of view, we found that the PPT-induced cell apoptosis for HeLa cells mainly stems from (or is regulated through) cellular thermal stress-responsive proteins, while for L929 and H8 cells it seems more related to DNA. Understanding molecular stress response difference of the PPT-induced cell apoptosis between cancerous and normal cells is helpful for diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and the method will open an avenue for single-cell studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28916822>Ampk phosphorylation of Ulk1 is required for targeting of  to lysosomes in exercise-induced mitophagy.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial health is critical for skeletal muscle function and is improved by exercise training through both mitochondrial biogenesis and removal of damaged/dysfunctional  via mitophagy. The mechanisms underlying exercise-induced mitophagy have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that acute treadmill running in mice causes mitochondrial oxidative stress at 3-12 h and mitophagy at 6 h post-exercise in skeletal muscle. These changes were monitored using a novel fluorescent reporter gene, pMitoTimer, that allows assessment of mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitophagy in vivo, and were preceded by increased phosphorylation of AMP activated protein kinase (Ampk) at  172 and of unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (Ulk1) at serine 555. Using mice expressing dominant negative and constitutively active Ampk in skeletal muscle, we demonstrate that Ulk1 activation is dependent on Ampk. Furthermore, exercise-induced metabolic adaptation requires Ulk1. These findings provide direct evidence of exercise-induced mitophagy and demonstrate the importance of Ampk-Ulk1 signaling in skeletal muscle.Exercise is associated with biogenesis and removal of dysfunctional . Here the authors use a mitochondrial reporter gene to demonstrate the occurrence of mitophagy following exercise in mice, and show this is dependent on AMPK and ULK1 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29097102>'SNO'-Storms Compromise Protein Activity and Mitochondrial Metabolism in Neurodegenerative Disorders.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), is currently a major public health concern due to the lack of efficient disease-modifying therapeutic options. Recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction and nitrosative/oxidative stress are key common mediators of pathogenesis. In this review, we highlight molecular mechanisms linking NO-dependent post-translational modifications, such as cysteine S-nitrosylation and  nitration, to abnormal mitochondrial metabolism. We further discuss the hypothesis that pathological levels of NO compromise brain energy metabolism via aberrant S-nitrosylation of key enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, contributing to neurodegenerative conditions. A better understanding of these pathophysiological events may provide a potential pathway for designing novel therapeutics to ameliorate neurodegenerative disorders.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we show that oncogenic HER2  kinase signaling induces phosphorylation of mitochondrial creatine kinase 1 (MtCK1) on  153 (Y153) in an ABL-dependent manner in breast cancer cells. Y153 phosphorylation, which is commonly upregulated in HER2 breast cancers, stabilizes MtCK1 to increase the phosphocreatine energy shuttle and promote proliferation. Inhibition of the phosphocreatine energy shuttle by MtCK1 knockdown or with the creatine analog cyclocreatine decreases proliferation of trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant HER2 cell lines in culture and in xenografts. Finally, we show that cyclocreatine in combination with the HER2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib reduces the growth of a trastuzumab-resistant HER2 patient-derived xenograft. These findings suggest that activation of the phosphocreatine energy shuttle by MtCK1 Y153 phosphorylation creates a druggable metabolic vulnerability in cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, recent investigations on the therapies of resistance to EGFR-TKIs are very limited. Therefore, it is important to develop more effective therapies to reverse EGFR-TKIs resistance. In our present study, erlotinib was used as the TKIs drug and the effects of the erlotinib on cell growth were evaluated. Cell viability and concentration dependent studies were performed using HCI-H1975 and HCI-H1299 cells alone with erlotinib, respectively. Further combined with rituximab, the results showed that erlotinib and rituximab were significantly inhibited the cell growth. Furthermore, the combination of erlotinib and rituximab greatly decreased the expression of p-mTOR and p-EGFR. Additional results from western blotting and immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that the accumulation of rictor was also decreased on MAM. Thus, all these results suggested that EGFR-TKIs combined with CD20 mono-antibody significantly decrease the cell growth of H1975 cells and H1299, with T790M EGFR mutation, and inhibit the localization of the key mTOR pathway proteins to MAM. So, it may be a promising strategy for overcoming EGFR TKI resistance in NSCLC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29717772>Connexin 43 reduces susceptibility to sympathetic atrial fibrillation.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia reported in clinical practice. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is a member of the connexin protein family, which serves important roles in signal transduction in vivo. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of Cx43 in the induction and maintenance of atrial fibrillation by using an animal model of sympathomimetic atrial fibrillation. Cx43 was successfully knocked down in the myocardium with gene‑specific small interfering (si)RNA via lentiviral infection. A total of 25 dogs were randomly and evenly divided into five groups: Normal (N), rapid atrial pacing (RAP), isoproterenol (ISO) + RAP, RAP + Cx43 siRNA and ISO + RAP + Cx43 siRNA. The mRNA and protein levels, as well as the distribution of Cx43 on the cell membrane, were gradually decreased in each group compared with the N group following treatment (P<0.05). The induction rate of the atrial effective refractory period was not significantly affected in the RAP and RAP + Cx43 siRNA groups, whereas it was significantly reduced in the ISO + RAP and ISO + RAP + Cx43 siRNA groups compared with the N group (P<0.05). The induction rate of AF was gradually increased in the RAP + Cx43 siRNA, ISO + RAP and ISO + RAP + Cx43 siRNA groups compared with the N group (P<0.05). The expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and  hydroxylase (TH) was gradually increased in the ISO + RAP and ISO + RAP + Cx43 siRNA groups compared with their respective controls (RAP and RAP + Cx43 siRNA groups, respectively). However, no significant difference in the levels of NGF and TH was observed between the RAP, RAP + Cx43 siRNA, ISO + RAP and ISO + RAP + Cx43 siRNA groups. The mitochondrial morphology in each group was notably altered compared with the N group. The mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and apoptotic index were gradually increased in each group compared with the N group (P<0.05). The results of the present study suggest that Cx43 reduces susceptibility to AF. Downregulation of Cx43 mediates the induction and maintenance of sympathetic AF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30841933>The VAPB-PTPIP51 endoplasmic reticulum- tethering proteins are present in neuronal synapses and regulate synaptic activity.</a></h2><p>Signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and  regulates a number of key neuronal functions. This signaling involves close physical contacts between the two organelles that are mediated by "tethering proteins" that function to recruit regions of ER to the mitochondrial surface. The ER protein, vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB) and the mitochondrial membrane protein, protein  phosphatase interacting protein-51 (PTPIP51), interact to form one such tether. Recently, damage to ER- signaling involving disruption of the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers has been linked to the pathogenic process in Parkinson's disease, fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) and related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Loss of neuronal synaptic function is a key feature of Parkinson's disease and FTD/ALS but the roles that ER- signaling and the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers play in synaptic function are not known. Here, we demonstrate that the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers regulate synaptic activity. VAPB and PTPIP51 localise and form contacts at synapses, and stimulating neuronal activity increases ER- contacts and the VAPB-PTPIP51 interaction. Moreover, siRNA loss of VAPB or PTPIP51 perturbs synaptic function and dendritic spine morphology. Our results reveal a new role for the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers in neurons and suggest that damage to ER- signaling contributes to synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and FTD/ALS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29156373>-targeted ubiquinone (MitoQ) enhances acetaldehyde clearance by reversing alcohol-induced posttranslational modification of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2: A molecular mechanism of protection against alcoholic liver disease.</a></h2><p>Alcohol metabolism in the liver generates highly toxic acetaldehyde. Breakdown of acetaldehyde by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) in the  consumes NAD and generates reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which represents a fundamental mechanism in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). A -targeted lipophilic ubiquinone (MitoQ) has been shown to confer greater protection against oxidative damage in the  compared to untargeted antioxidants. The present study aimed to investigate if MitoQ could preserve mitochondrial ALDH2 activity and speed up acetaldehyde clearance, thereby protects against ALD. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to alcohol for 8 weeks with MitoQ supplementation (5mg/kg/d) for the last 4 weeks. MitoQ ameliorated alcohol-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress and glutathione deficiency. It also reversed alcohol-reduced hepatic ALDH activity and accelerated acetaldehyde clearance through modulating ALDH2 cysteine S-nitrosylation,  nitration and 4-hydroxynonenol adducts formation. MitoQ ameliorated nitric oxide (NO) donor-mediated ADLH2 S-nitrosylation and nitration in Hepa-1c1c7 cells under glutathion depletion condition. In addition, alcohol-increased circulating acetaldehyde levels were accompanied by reduced intestinal ALDH activity and impaired intestinal barrier. In accordance, MitoQ reversed alcohol-increased plasma endotoxin levels and hepatic toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-NF-κB signaling along with subsequent inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration. MitoQ also reversed alcohol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation through enhancing fatty acid β-oxidation. Alcohol-induced ER stress and apoptotic cell death signaling were reversed by MitoQ. This study demonstrated that speeding up acetaldehyde clearance by preserving ALDH2 activity critically mediates the beneficial effect of MitoQ on alcohol-induced pathogenesis at the gut-liver axis.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is expressed in several distinct subcellular compartments and mediates the effects of nutrients, growth factors, and stress on cell growth. However, the contributions of these various regulators to DAergic cell death have been demonstrated mainly in culture with serum, which is known to dramatically influence endogenous growth rate and toxin susceptibility through nutrient and growth factor signaling. Therefore, we compared neurotoxicity induced by the mitochondrial inhibitor rotenone (ROT, 5 or 10 μM for 24 h) in SH-SY5Y cells cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% FBS, or 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, serum-free). In addition, C57BL/6J mice were injected with 12 μg ROT into the right striatum, and brains examined by histology and Western blotting 2 weeks later for evidence of DAergic cell death and the underlying signaling mechanisms. ROT dose-dependently reduced SH-SY5Y cell viability in all serum groups without a significant effect of serum concentration. ROT injection also significantly reduced immunoreactivity for the DAergic cell marker  hydroxylase (TH) in both the mouse striatum and SNpc. Western blotting revealed that ROT inhibited TH and Parkin expression while increasing α-syn and PINK1 expression in both SH-SY5Y cells and injected mice, consistent with disruption of mitochondrial function. Moreover, expression levels of the mTOR signaling pathway components mTORC, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), ULK1, and ATG13 were altered in ROT-induced PD. Further, serum level influenced mTOR signaling in the absence of ROT and the changes in response to ROT. Signs of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and altered expression of tethering proteins mediating -associated ER contacts (MAMs) were also altered concomitant with ROT-induced neurodegeneration. Taken together, this study demonstrates that complex mechanism involving mitochondrial dysfunction, altered mTOR nutrient-sensing pathways, ER stress, and disrupted MAM protein dynamics are involved in DAergic neurodegeneration in response to ROT.Copyright © 2019 Ramalingam, Huh and Lee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982603>Redox State Controls Phase Separation of the Yeast Ataxin-2 Protein via Reversible Oxidation of Its Methionine-Rich Low-Complexity Domain.</a></h2><p>Yeast ataxin-2, also known as Pbp1, senses the activity state of  in order to regulate TORC1. A domain of Pbp1 required to adapt cells to mitochondrial activity is of low sequence complexity. The low-complexity (LC) domain of Pbp1 forms labile, cross-β polymers that facilitate phase transition of the protein into liquid-like or gel-like states. Phase transition for other LC domains is reliant upon widely distributed aromatic amino acids. In place of  or phenylalanine residues prototypically used for phase separation, Pbp1 contains 24 similarly disposed methionine residues. Here, we show that the Pbp1 methionine residues are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (HO)-mediated oxidation in vitro and in living cells. Methionine oxidation melts Pbp1 liquid-like droplets in a manner reversed by methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymes. These observations explain how reversible formation of labile polymers by the Pbp1 LC domain enables the protein to function as a sensor of cellular redox state.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

STAT3 à La Carte.</a></h2><p>The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 mediates the functions of cytokines, growth factors, and oncogenes under both physiological and pathological conditions. Uncontrolled/constitutive STAT3 activity is often detected in tumors of different types, where its role is mostly that of an oncogene, contributing in multiple ways to tumor transformation, growth, and progression. For this reason, many laboratories and pharmaceutical companies are making efforts to develop specific inhibitors. However, STAT3 has also been shown to act as a tumor suppressor in a number of cases, suggesting that its activity is strongly context-specific. Here, we discuss the bases that can explain the multiple roles of this factor in both physiological and pathological contexts. In particular, we focus on the following four features: (i) the distinct properties of the STAT3α and β isoforms; (ii) the multiple post-translational modifications (phosphorylation on  or serine, acetylation and methylation on different residues, and oxidation and glutathionylation) that can affect its activities downstream of multiple different signals; (iii) the non-canonical functions in the , contributing to the maintenance of energy homeostasis under stress conditions; and (iv) the recently discovered functions in the endoplasmic reticulum, where STAT3 contributes to the regulation of calcium homeostasis, energy production, and apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545064>Mitochondrial Hyperactivation and Enhanced ROS Production are Involved in Toxicity Induced by Oncogenic Kinases Over-Signaling.</a></h2><p>Targeted therapy is an effective, rational, and safe approach to solid and hematological tumors treatment. Unfortunately, a significant fraction of patients treated with  kinase inhibitors (TKI) relapses mainly because of gene amplification, mutations, or other bypass mechanisms. Recently a growing number of papers showed how, in some cases, resistance due to oncogene overexpression may be associated with drug addiction: cells able to proliferate in the presence of high TKI doses become also TKI dependent, undergoing cellular stress, and apoptosis/death upon drug withdrawal. Notably, if a sub-cellular population survives TKI discontinuation it is also partially re-sensitized to the same drug. Thus, it is possible that a subset of patients relapsing upon TKI treatment may benefit from a discontinuous therapeutic schedule. We focused on two different hematologic malignancies, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), both successfully treatable with TKIs. The two models utilized (LAMA and SUP-M2) differed in having oncogene overexpression as the sole cause of drug resistance (CML), or additionally carrying kinase domain mutations (ALCL). In both cases drug withdrawal caused a sudden overload of oncogenic signal, enhanced  activity, induced the release of a high amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and caused genotoxic stress and massive cell death. In LAMA cells (CML) we could rescue the cells from death by partially blocking downstream oncogenic signaling or lowering ROS detrimental effect by adding reduced glutathione.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526058>P300/CBP-associated factor regulates transcription and function of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 during muscle differentiation.</a></h2><p>The epigenetic enzyme p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) belongs to the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family together with GCN5. Although its transcriptional and post-translational function is well characterized, little is known about its properties as regulator of cell metabolism. Here, we report the mitochondrial localization of PCAF conferred by an 85 aa mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) at the N-terminal region of the protein. In , one of the PCAF targets is the isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) acetylated at lysine 180. This PCAF-regulated post-translational modification might reduce IDH2 affinity for isocitrate as a result of a conformational shift involving predictively the  at position 179. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies indicate that PCAF regulates IDH2, acting at dual level during myoblast differentiation: at a transcriptional level together with MyoD, and at a post-translational level by direct modification of lysine acetylation in . The latter event determines a decrease in IDH2 function with negative consequences on muscle fiber formation in C2C12 cells. Indeed, a MTS-deprived PCAF does not localize into , remains enriched into the nucleus, and contributes to a significant increase of muscle-specific gene expression enhancing muscle differentiation.

N, N-diethyl-7-aminocoumarin is a fluorescent -targeting probe. In this study, a series of STAT3 inhibitors were developed by connecting N, N-diethyl-7-aminocoumarin fluorophore with benzo [b]thiophene 1, 1-dioxide moiety. All designed compounds displayed potent anti-proliferative activity against cancer cells. The representative compound 7a was mainly accumulated in  visualized by its fluorescence. STAT3 phosphorylation was inhibited by compound 7a at both Tyr705 and Ser727 residues. Compound 7a inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation whereas had no influence on the phosphorylation levels of STAT1, JAK2, Src and Erk1/2, indicating good selectivity of compound 7a.

Here, we discuss direct conjugation of mitochondrial-targeting moieties to anticancer drugs, antioxidants and sensor molecules. Among them, the most widely applied mitochondrial targeting moiety is triphenylphosphonium (TPP), which is a delocalized cationic lipid that readily accumulates and penetrates through the mitochondrial membrane due to the highly negative mitochondrial membrane potential. Other moieties, including short peptides, dequalinium, guanidine, rhodamine, and F16, are also known to be promising mitochondrial targeting agents. Direct conjugation of mitochondrial targeting moieties to anticancer drugs, antioxidants and sensors results in increased cytotoxicity, anti-oxidizing activity and sensing activity, respectively, compared with their non-targeting counterparts, especially in drug-resistant cells.

The age-related decrease in sperm quality as indicated by reduction of sperm concentration, sperm mobility and osmotic tolerance was associated to variation in the level of specific water-soluble and liposoluble metabolites. In particular, the highest levels of isoleucine, phenylalanine, leucine,  and valine were found at 32 weeks of age, whereas aspartate, lactate, creatine, carnitine, acetylcarnitine levels increased during the ageing. Lipid composition also changed during the ageing: diunsaturated fatty acids level increased from 32 to 56 weeks of age, whereas a reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acids content was observed at 56 weeks. The untargeted approach attempts to give a wider picture of metabolic changes occurring in ageing suggesting that the reduction of sperm quality could be due to a progressive deficiency in mitochondrial energy producing systems, as also prompted by the negative correlation found between sperm mobility and the increase in certain mitochondrial metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115776> nitration of mitochondrial proteins during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.</a></h2><p>Myocardial ischemia reperfusion is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased formation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. The main purpose of this study was to assess the role of  nitration of mitochondrial proteins in postischemic contractile dysfunction known as myocardial stunning. Isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were subjected to 20-min global ischemia followed by 30-min reperfusion. The reperfused hearts showed marked decline in left ventricular developed pressure, maximal rate of contraction (+dP/dt), and maximal rate of relaxation (-dP/dt). Immunofluorescence and ELISA assays demonstrated enhanced protein  nitration in reperfused hearts. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, eight mitochondrial proteins were identified to be nitrated after ischemia reperfusion. These proteins are crucial in mitochondrial electron transport, fatty acid oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, ATP synthesis, and control of high-energy phosphates. The proteome data also indicated reduced abundance in several of nitrated proteins. The results suggest that these changes may contribute to inhibition of aconitase activity but are unlikely to affect electron transport chain activity. Whether  nitration of mitochondrial proteins can be considered the contributing factor of postischemic contractile dysfunction remains to be explored.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30374025>Triple herbal extract DA-9805 exerts a neuroprotective effect via amelioration of mitochondrial damage in experimental models of Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>Moutan cortex, Angelica Dahurica root, and Bupleurum root are traditional herbal medicines used in Asian countries to treat various diseases caused by oxidative stress or inflammation. Parkinson's disease (PD) has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, but no effective treatment for mitochondrial dysfunction has yet been identified. In this study we investigated the neuroprotective effects of the triple herbal extract DA-9805 in experimental models of PD. DA-9805 was prepared by extracting three dried plant materials (Moutan cortex, Angelica Dahurica root, and Bupleurum root in a 1:1:1 mixture) with 90% ethanol on a stirring plate for 24 h at room temperature and fingerprinted using high-performance liquid chromatography. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and its active metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP), which both exert neurotoxic effects on dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex I, were used to make experimental models of PD. In MPP-treated SH-SY5Y cells, DA-9805 ameliorated the suppression of  hydroxylase expression and mitochondrial damage on OXPHOS complex 1 activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and oxygen consumption rate. In the MPTP-induced subacute PD model mice, oral administration of DA-9805 recovered dopamine content as well as bradykinesia, as determined by the rotarod test. DA-9805 protected against neuronal damage in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum. In both in vitro and in vivo models of PD, DA-9805 normalized the phosphorylation of AKT at S473 and T308 on the insulin signaling pathway and the expression of -related genes. These results demonstrate that the triple herbal extract DA-9805 showed neuroprotective effects via alleviating  damage in experimental models of PD. We propose that DA-9805 may be a suitable candidate for disease-modifying therapeutics for PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29383690>Glia Maturation Factor Dependent Inhibition of Mitochondrial PGC-1α Triggers Oxidative Stress-Mediated Apoptosis in N27 Rat Dopaminergic Neuronal Cells.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting over five million individuals worldwide. The exact molecular events underlying PD pathogenesis are still not clearly known. Glia maturation factor (GMF), a neuroinflammatory protein in the brain plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. Mitochondrial dysfunctions and oxidative stress trigger apoptosis leading to dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in PD. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α or PPARGC-α) acts as a transcriptional co-regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism by controlling oxidative phosphorylation, antioxidant activity, and autophagy. In this study, we found that incubation of immortalized rat dopaminergic (N27) neurons with GMF influences the expression of peroxisome PGC-1α and increases oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptotic cell death. We show that incubation with GMF reduces the expression of PGC-1α with concomitant decreases in the mitochondrial complexes. Besides, there is increased oxidative stress and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in these cells. Further, GMF reduces  hydroxylase (TH) expression and shifts Bax/Bcl-2 expression resulting in release of cytochrome-c and increased activations of effector caspase expressions. Transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed alteration in the mitochondrial architecture. Our results show that GMF acts as an important upstream regulator of PGC-1α in promoting dopaminergic neuronal death through its effect on oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. Our current data suggest that GMF is a critical risk factor for PD and suggest that it could be explored as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit PD progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30189266>Circadian control of BDNF-mediated Nrf2 activation in astrocytes protects dopaminergic neurons from ferroptosis.</a></h2><p>Astrocyte-neuron interactions protect neurons from iron-mediated toxicity. As dopamine can be metabolized to reactive quinones, dopaminergic neurons are susceptible to oxidative damage and ferroptosis-like induced cell death. Detoxification enzymes are required to protect neurons. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in the regulation of redox sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 in astrocytes and metabolic cooperation between astrocytes and neurons. This article reviews the importance of BDNF and astrocyte-neuron interactions in the protection of neurons against oxidative damages in rodent brains. We previously proposed that BDNF activates Nrf2 via the truncated TrkB.T1 and p75 receptor complex in astrocytes. Stimulation by BDNF generates the signaling molecule ceramide, which activates PKCζ leading to induction of the CK2-Nrf2 signaling axis. As a cell clock regulates p75 expression, we suggested that BDNF effectively activates Nrf2 in astrocytes during the rest phase. In contrast, neurons express both TrkB.FL and TrkB.T1, and TrkB.FL  kinase activity inhibits p75-dependent ceramide generation and internalizes p75. Therefore, BDNF may not effectively activate Nrf2 in neurons. Notably, neurons only weakly activate detoxification and antioxidant enzymes/proteins via the Nrf2-ARE signaling axis. Thus, astrocytes may provide relevant transcripts and/or proteins to neurons via microparticles/exosomes increasing neuronal resistance to oxidative stress. Circadian increases in the levels of circulating glucocorticoids may further facilitate material transfer from astrocytes to neurons via the stimulation of pannexin 1 channels-P2X7R signaling pathway in astrocytes at the beginning of the active phase. Dysregulation of astrocyte-neuron interactions could therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Retinal neurodegeneration is an early event in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) that precedes and participates in the microcirculatory abnormalities that occur in DR. Our objective was to investigate the role and mechanisms of taurine in early diabetic retinas. : Eight-week-old STZ-induced diabetic rats and control animals were randomly assigned to receive taurine or vehicle by intraperitoneal injection or by intragastric administration. The retinal function and retinal cell counts were evaluated using an electroretinography (ERG) and immunofluorescence microscopy. Plasma amino acids were measured by ion-exchange chromatography (IEC). The expression levels of retinal taurine transporter (Tau-T), -dependent apoptosis-associated genes and reactive gliosis markers were studied by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Pre- and post-synaptic markers (PSD95 and mGluR6) in outer plexiform layer (OPL), and the bipolar cell marker protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) were localized by immunofluorescence. Levels of PSD95 and mGluR6 were determined by quantitative western blot. : Taurine significantly prevented the reduction of photopic b-wave amplitude and retinal cone cells and ganglion cells loss and maintained the Bcl-2/Bax ratio balance in diabetic rats. Taurine also prevented the upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and reduced retinal reactive gliosis. Taurine reduced plasma glutamate and  levels, which were elevated in diabetic rats. Moreover, mGluR6 levels reduction detected by western blot and immunofluorescence in diabetic retinas was inhibited and the displacement of mGluR6 in OPL into the inner nuclear layer (INL) detected by immunofluorescence was reduced by Taurine treatment. : Taurine may protect retinal cells from diabetic attacks by activating Tau-T, reducing retinal reactive gliosis, improving retinal synaptic connections and decreasing retinal cell apoptosis. Thus, taurine treatment may be a novel approach for early DR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29930100>Interplay between ShcA Signaling and PGC-1α Triggers Targetable Metabolic Vulnerabilities in Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>The ShcA adaptor protein transduces oncogenic signals downstream of receptor  kinases. We show here that breast tumors engage the ShcA pathway to increase their metabolism. ShcA signaling enhanced glucose catabolism through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, rendering breast cancer cells critically dependent on glucose. ShcA signaling simultaneously increased the metabolic rate and flexibility of breast cancer cells by inducing the PGC-1α transcriptional coactivator, a central regulator of mitochondrial metabolism. Breast tumors that engaged ShcA signaling were critically dependent on PGC-1α to support their increased metabolic rate. PGC-1α deletion drastically delayed breast tumor onset in an orthotopic mouse model, highlighting a key role for PGC-1α in tumor initiation. Conversely, reduced ShcA signaling impaired both the metabolic rate and flexibility of breast cancer cells, rendering them reliant on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic reprogramming exposed a targetable metabolic vulnerability, leading to a sensitization of breast tumors to inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I (biguanides). Genetic inhibition of ShcA signaling in the Polyoma virus middle T (MT) breast cancer mouse model sensitized mammary tumors to biguanides during the earliest stages of breast cancer progression. Tumor initiation and growth were selectively and severely impaired in MT/ShcA-deficient animals. These data demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming is a key component of ShcA signaling and serves an unappreciated yet vital role during breast cancer initiation and progression. These data further unravel a novel interplay between ShcA and PGC-1α in the coordination of metabolic reprogramming and demonstrate the sensitivity of breast tumors to drugs targeting oxidative phosphorylation. This study uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism that links aberrant RTK signaling with metabolic perturbations in breast cancer and exposes metabolic vulnerabilities that can be targeted by inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. .©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30816517>Neuroprotection of hydroxysafflor yellow A in experimental cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via metabolic inhibition of phenylalanine and mitochondrial biogenesis.</a></h2><p>Stroke is the second most frequent cause of mortality, resulting in a huge societal burden worldwide. Timely reperfusion is the most effective therapy; however, it is difficult to prevent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In traditional Chinese medicine, hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) has been widely used for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease and as a protective therapy against I/R injury. Evidence has demonstrated that HSYA could reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species and suppress cellular apoptosis; however, whether HSYA alters the metabolic profile as its underlying mechanism for neuroprotection remains unknown. In the present study, using a metabolomic screening, phenylalanine was identified to significantly increase in an experimental model of mouse cerebral I/R injury. Notably, western blotting and qPCR analysis were conducted to test the expression level of apoptosis‑associated factors, and HSYA was identified to be able to protect neuronal cells by reducing phenylalanine level associated with I/R injury. Additionally, these findings were confirmed in primary mouse neurons and PC12 cells exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) stress. Of note, HSYA was observed to regulate the mRNA expression of key metabolic enzymes, phenylalanine hydroxylase,  aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, which are responsible for phenylalanine metabolism. Furthermore, by performing mitochondrial labeling and JC‑1 fluorescence assay, HSYA was identified to promote mitochondrial function and biogenesis suppressed by OGD/R. The findings of the present study demonstrated that I/R injury could increase the levels of phenylalanine, and HSYA may inhibit phenylalanine synthesis to enhance mitochondrial function and biogenesis for neuroprotection. The present study proposed a novel metabolite biomarker for cerebral I/R injury and the evaluated the efficacy of HSYA as a potential therapeutic treatment I/R injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30195712>Role of protein kinase Cδ in dopaminergic neurotoxic events.</a></h2><p>The pro-apoptotic role of Protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), a member of the novel PKC subfamily, has been well-documented in various pathological conditions. In the central nervous system, the possible role of PKCδ has been studied, mainly in the condition of dopaminergic loss. It has been suggested that the phosphorylation of PKCδ at  311 residue (Tyr) by redox-sensitive Src family kinases (SFKs) is critical for the caspase-3-mediated proteolytic cleavage, which produces the constitutively active cleaved form of PKCδ. Mitochondrial translocation of cleaved PKCδ has been suggested to facilitate -derived apoptosis and oxidative burdens. Moreover, it has been suggested that PKCδ contribute to neuroinflammation through the transformation of microglia into the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and the assembly of membrane NADPH oxidase in dopaminergic impairments. Interestingly, mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors or neuroinflammogens have shown to induce PKCδ activation in dopaminergic systems. Thus, PKCδ activation may be one of the pivotal causes of neuropathologic events, and could amplify these processes further in a positive feedback manner. Furthermore, PKCδ may play an intermediary role in connecting each neuropathologic event. This review affords insight into the role of PKCδ in various dopaminergic neurotoxic models, which could provide a potential target for mitigating dopaminergic neurotoxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Following nerve injury, axonal  release mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), including formylated peptides and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We hypothesize that mtDAMPs released from disintegrated axonal  may stimulate Schwann cells to put out cytoplasmic processes. We investigated RT4-D6P2T schwannoma cells (RT4)  treated with N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or cytosine-phospho-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN) for 1, 6 and 24 h. We also used immunohistochemical detection to monitor the expression of formylpeptide receptor 2 (FPR2) and toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), the canonical receptors for formylated peptides and mtDNA, in RT4 cells and Schwann cells distal to nerve injury. RT4 cells treated with fMLP put out a significantly higher number of cytoplasmic processes compared to control cells. Preincubation with PBP10, a selective inhibitor of FPR2 resulted in a significant reduction of cytoplasmic process outgrowth. A significantly higher number of cytoplasmic processes was also found after treatment with CpG ODN compared to control cells. Pretreatment with inhibitory ODN (INH ODN) resulted in a reduced number of cytoplasmic processes after subsequent treatment with CpG ODN only at 6 h, but 1 and 24 h treatment with CpG ODN demonstrated an additive effect of INH ODN on the development of cytoplasmic processes. Immunohistochemistry and western blot detected increased levels of -phosphorylated paxillin in RT4 cells associated with cytoplasmic process outgrowth after fMLP or CpG ODN treatment. We found increased immunofluorescence of FPR2 and TLR9 in RT4 cells treated with fMLP or CpG ODN as well as in activated Schwann cells distal to the nerve injury. In addition, activated Schwann cells displayed FPR2 and TLR9 immunostaining close to GAP43-immunopositive regenerated axons and their growth cones after nerve crush. Increased FPR2 and TLR9 immunoreaction was associated with activation of p38 and NFkB, respectively. Surprisingly, the growth cones displayed also FPR2 and TLR9 immunostaining. These results present the first evidence that potential mtDAMPs may play a key role in the induction of Schwann cell processes. This reaction of Schwann cells can be mediated via FPR2 and TLR9 that are canonical receptors for formylated peptides and mtDNA. The possible role for FPR2 and TLR9 in growth cones is also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070476>Endothelial-Specific Deficiency of ATG5 (Autophagy Protein 5) Attenuates Ischemia-Related Angiogenesis.</a></h2><p>Objective- Pathological angiogenesis, such as exuberant retinal neovascularization during proliferative retinopathies, involves endothelial responses to ischemia/hypoxia and oxidative stress. Autophagy is a clearance system enabling bulk degradation of intracellular components and is implicated in cellular adaptation to stressful conditions. Here, we addressed the role of the ATG5 (autophagy-related protein 5) in endothelial cells in the context of pathological ischemia-related neovascularization in the murine model of retinopathy of prematurity. Approach and Results- Autophagic vesicles accumulated in neovascular tufts of the retina of retinopathy of prematurity mice. Endothelium-specific Atg5 deletion reduced pathological neovascularization in the retinopathy of prematurity model. In contrast, no alterations in physiological retina vascularization were observed in endothelial-specific ATG5 deficiency, suggesting a specific role of endothelial ATG5 in pathological hypoxia/reoxygenation-related angiogenesis. Consistently, in an aortic ring angiogenesis assay, endothelial ATG5 deficiency resulted in impaired angiogenesis under hypoxia/reoxygenation conditions. As compared to ATG5-sufficient endothelial cells, ATG5-deficient cells displayed impaired mitochondrial respiratory activity, diminished production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and decreased phosphorylation of the VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2). Consistently, ATG5-deficient endothelial cells displayed decreased oxidative inactivation of PTPs (phospho- phosphatases), likely due to the reduced reactive oxygen species levels resulting from ATG5 deficiency. Conclusions- Our data suggest that endothelial ATG5 supports mitochondrial function and proangiogenic signaling in endothelial cells in the context of pathological hypoxia/reoxygenation-related neovascularization. Endothelial ATG5, therefore, represents a potential target for the treatment of pathological neovascularization-associated diseases, such as retinopathies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29044214>Limits of aerobic metabolism in cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Cancer cells exhibit high rates of glycolysis and glutaminolysis. Glycolysis can provide energy and glutaminolysis can provide carbon for anaplerosis and reductive carboxylation to citrate. However, all these metabolic requirements could be in principle satisfied from glucose. Here we investigate why cancer cells do not satisfy their metabolic demands using aerobic biosynthesis from glucose. Based on the typical composition of a mammalian cell we quantify the energy demand and the OxPhos burden of cell biosynthesis from glucose. Our calculation demonstrates that aerobic growth from glucose is feasible up to a minimum doubling time that is proportional to the OxPhos burden and inversely proportional to the  OxPhos capacity. To grow faster cancer cells must activate aerobic glycolysis for energy generation and uncouple NADH generation from biosynthesis. To uncouple biosynthesis from NADH generation cancer cells can synthesize lipids from carbon sources that do not produce NADH in their catabolism, including acetate and the amino acids glutamate, glutamine, phenylalanine and . Finally, we show that cancer cell lines have an OxPhos capacity that is insufficient to support aerobic biosynthesis from glucose. We conclude that selection for high rate of biosynthesis implies a selection for aerobic glycolysis and uncoupling biosynthesis from NADH generation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29260454>Neuroprotective effect of treadmill exercise possibly via regulation of lysosomal degradation molecules in mice with pharmacologically induced Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>Dysfunction of mitophagy, which is a selective degradation of defective  for quality control, is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, how treadmill exercise (TE) regulates mitophagy-related molecules in PD remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to investigate how TE regulates α-synuclein (α-syn)-induced neurotoxicity and mitophagy-related molecules in the nigro-striatal region of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-mice. Our data showed that TE exhibited a significant restoration of  hydroxylase and motor coordination with suppression of α-syn expression, hallmarks of PD, possibly via up-regulation of lysosomal degradation molecules, LAMP-2 and cathepsin L, with down-regulation of p62, LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, PINK1 and parkin in the substantia nigra of MPTP mice.

TET modulates FOXP3 expression, while dysregulation of FOXP3 expression promotes the malignant progression of leukemia cells. We examined the role of TET-FOXP3 axis in the cytotoxic effects of ATO on the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line, U937. ATO-induced apoptosis in U937 cells was characterized by activation of caspase-3/-9, mitochondrial depolarization, and MCL1 downregulation. In addition, ATO-treated U937 cells showed ROS-mediated inhibition of TET2 transcription, leading to downregulation of FOXP3 expression and in turn, suppression of FOXP3-mediated activation of Lyn and Akt. Overexpression of FOXP3 or Lyn minimized the suppressive effect of ATO on Akt activation and MCL1 expression. Promoter luciferase activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed the crucial role of Akt-mediated CREB phosphorylation in MCL1 transcription. Further, ATO-induced Akt inactivation promoted GSK3β-mediated degradation of MCL1. Transfection of constitutively active Akt expression abrogated ATO-induced MCL1 downregulation. MCL1 overexpression lessened the ATO-induced depolarization of mitochondrial membrane and increased the viability of ATO-treated cells. Thus, our data suggest that ATO induces -mediated apoptosis in U937 cells through its suppressive effect on TET2-FOXP3-Lyn-Akt axis-modulated MCL1 transcription and protein stabilization. Our findings also indicate that the same pathway underlies ATO-induced death in human leukemia HL-60 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although many components and mediators of inflammasome activation have been identified, how NLRP3 inflammasome is regulated to prevent excessive inflammation is unclear. Here we show NLRP3 inflammasome stimulators trigger Src homology-2 domain containing protein  phosphatase-2 (SHP2) translocation to the , to interact with and dephosphorylate adenine nucleotide translocase 1 (ANT1), a central molecule controlling mitochondrial permeability transition. This mechanism prevents collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and the subsequent release of mitochondrial DNA and reactive oxygen species, thus preventing hyperactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Ablation or inhibition of SHP2 in macrophages causes intensified NLRP3 activation, overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and increased sensitivity to peritonitis.

Breast cancers frequently overexpress the histone methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2). However, the role of EZH2 in this setting is unclear due to the context-dependent functions of PRC2 and the heterogeneity of breast cancer. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying PRC2 overexpression in cancer are obscure. Here, using multiple models of breast cancer driven by the oncogene ErbB2, we show that the  kinase c-Src links energy sufficiency with PRC2 overexpression via control of mRNA translation. By stimulating mitochondrial ATP production, c-Src suppresses energy stress, permitting sustained activation of the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which increases the translation of mRNAs encoding the PRC2 subunits Ezh2 and Suz12. We show that Ezh2 overexpression and activity are pivotal in ErbB2-mediated mammary tumourigenesis.

Here, we report that MET signaling plays an important role in conferring a unique metabolic phenotype to cellular models expressing MET-activating mutated variants that are either sensitive or resistant toward MET small molecule inhibitors. MET phosphorylation downregulated by the specific MET inhibitor tepotinib resulted in markedly decreased viability and increased apoptosis in tepotinib-sensitive cells. Moreover, prior to the induction of MET inhibition-dependent cell death, tepotinib also led to an altered metabolic signature, characterized by a prominent reduction of metabolite ions related to amino sugar metabolism, gluconeogenesis, glycine and serine metabolism, and of numerous TCA cycle-related metabolites such as succinate, malate, and citrate. Functionally, a decrease in oxygen consumption rate, a reduced citrate synthase activity, a drop in membrane potential, and an associated misbalanced mitochondrial function were observed exclusively in MET inhibitor-sensitive cells. These data imply that interference with metabolic state can be considered an early indicator of efficient MET inhibition and particular changes reported here could be explored in the future as markers of efficacy of anti-MET therapies.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31436944>  Structure and Position in the Local Control of Calcium Signals in Smooth Muscle Cells.</a></h2><p>Features of Ca signals including the amplitude, duration, frequency and location are encoded by various physiological stimuli. These features of the signals are decoded by cells to selectively activate smooth muscle functions that include contraction and proliferation [1–3]. Central, therefore, to an appreciation of how smooth muscle is controlled is an understanding of the regulation of Ca. In smooth muscle, Ca signals arise from two major sources. The first is the extracellular space from which Ca enters the cell via channels such as voltage-dependent Ca channels, store-operated Ca (SOC) channels and various members of the transient receptor potential channel family. The second major Ca source is the internal Ca store (sarcoplasmic reticulum; SR) [4–6]. The SR accumulates Ca using sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPases (SERCA) and Ca is released from the SR via the ligand-gated channel/receptor complexes, the IP receptor (IPR) and ryanodine receptor (RyR). Release of Ca via IPR is activated by IP generated in response to many G-protein or  kinase-linked receptor activators including drugs [7,8]. RyR may be activated pharmacologically (e.g., caffeine), by Ca influx from outside the cell in the process of Ca-induced Ca release (CICR), or when the stores Ca content exceeds normal physiological values, that is in store overload [2,9–12]. Activation of either Ca influx or Ca release results in an increase of the cytoplasmic Ca concentration ([Ca]) from the resting value of ~100 nM to ~1 μM for many seconds throughout the cell, and transiently (e.g., 100 ms) to much higher values (e.g., 50 µM) in small parts of the cytoplasm close to sites of influx or Ca release. These local Ca signals begin with the opening of one or a few channels, allowing a large flux of the ion into the cytoplasm. Influx to the cytoplasm via voltage-dependent Ca channels occurs at rates of ~0.6 million Ca ions per second per channel (0.2 pA current). The influx generates a significant local concentration gradient near the channel in which [Ca] declines from ~10 μM to ~100 nM over a few hundred nanometers from the plasma membrane [2,13–17]. Voltage-dependent Ca channel open time is brief (~1 ms) and the gradient dissipates rapidly with rates of change in the subplasma membrane space on the order of ~5000 μM s [2] as compared to a much slower rate of ~0.5 μM s in the bulk cytoplasm [2] after a global [Ca] rise [18,19]. The large difference in rate of decline in the subplasma membrane space and bulk cytoplasm arise because local changes are driven mostly by buffering and diffusion while the slower rate of decline in bulk cytoplasm is determined by pumps. High local [Ca] and the rapid rates of change near channels may target processes with rapid Ca binding kinetics to selectively activate particular functions [20–23]. The high local [Ca] signals arising from influx also, in turn, may activate IPR or RyR to amplify the local signals or propagate through the cell as global signals with slower but more widespread effects [24–30]. The transition of signals from those involving single to multiple channels and from local to global Ca increases creates a multitude of signals with various locations, magnitudes and time courses [31–34] so that various cellular biological responses may be selectively activated. It is acknowledged that a major way that Ca signaling specifically targets particular biological processes is by increases in concentration of the ion being selectively localized to certain regions of the cell (Figure 9.1) [36,37]. In native smooth muscle cells,  contribute to the localization of Ca signals and to the modulation of the amplitude of Ca signals [38–42].  regulate these local signals by the organelles’ ability to take up and release the ion. Ca uptake occurs through the mitochondrial Ca uniporter while efflux is mediated by the mitochondrial Na/Ca exchanger. Mitochondrial Ca uptake and efflux may regulate cytoplasmic Ca concentrations both directly and indirectly. Direct regulation occurs by alteration of bulk Ca levels (Figures 9.2 and 9.3) [18,40,44–47]. Indirect regulation occurs as a result of mitochondrial influence on the activity of SR or plasma membrane Ca channels. This chapter describes how the structure and positioning of  contribute to the control of Ca signaling, including a previously unrecognized ability of the position of the organelles to increase local Ca entry via voltage-dependent Ca channels.© 2019 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30362532>Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide inhibits UVB-induced melanogenesis by antagonizing cAMP/PKA and ROS/MAPK signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Ultraviolet (UV)-induced pigmentation is very common in clinical practice, but the current treatments are rarely effective, accompanied by some side effects. Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide (GLP) is a natural antioxidant with no toxic side effects, which can antagonize UVB-induced fibroblast photo aging. The study aims to explore the role of GLP in inhibiting UVB-induced melanogenesis and its possible mechanism. The expression of melanogenesis genes such as microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF),  (TYR), tyrosinase related protein 1 (TYRP1), tyrosinase related protein 2 (TYRP2), ras-related protein Rab-27A (Rab27A), and Myosin shows an upward trend after exposure of B16F10 and PIG1 cells to UVB irradiation, but GLP can downregulate the expression of genes related to UVB-induced melanogenesis. GLP can inhibit UVB-activated protein kinase A (PKA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Besides, GLP protects  from UVB damage and inhibits reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Also, UVB-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) can be inhibited. It has been found in the experiments of UVB-induced skin pigmentation in zebrafish that GLP is capable of inhibiting UVB-induced skin pigmentation. Meanwhile, it can greatly relieve erythema reaction in guinea pig skin caused by high-dosage UVB irradiation. In conclusion, this study shows that GLP can inhibit UVB-induced melanogenesis by antagonizing cAMP/PKA and ROS/MAPK signaling pathways and is a potential natural safe whitening sunscreen additive.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31043679>Non-cell autonomous modulation of  hydroxylase by HMGB1 released from astrocytes in an acute MPTP-induced Parkinsonian mouse model.</a></h2><p>High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is actively secreted from inflammatory cells and acts via a non-cell-autonomous mechanism to play an important role in mediating cell proliferation and migration. The HMGB1-RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) axis upregulates  hydroxylase (TH) expression in response to extracellular insults in dopaminergic neurons in vitro, but little is known about HMGB1 in modulation of dopaminergic neurons in vivo. Here, using immunohistochemistry, we show that HMGB1 and RAGE expression are higher in the nigral area of MPTP (methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-treated mice, a toxin-induced Parkinsonian mouse model, compared with saline-treated controls. HMGB1 was predominantly localized to astrocytes and may affect neighboring dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP mouse model, owing to co-localization of RAGE in these TH-positive cells. In addition, MPTP induced a decrease in TH expression, an effect that was potentiated by inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or RAGE. Moreover, stereotaxic injection of recombinant HMGB1 attenuated the MPTP-induced reduction of TH in a Parkinsonian mouse model.

Mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to loss of ATP-dependent cellular functions, calcium overload, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, is implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Using the 5-HT receptor agonist LY344864, a known inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis (MB), we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of stimulating MB on dopaminergic neuron loss in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.Male C57BL/6 mice underwent bilateral intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine or saline injections and daily treatment with 2 mg·kg LY344864 or vehicle for 14 days beginning 7 days post-lesion.  hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-ir) and MB were assessed in the brains of all groups following treatment, and locomotor activity was evaluated prior to lesioning, 7 days post-lesion and after treatment.Increased mitochondrial DNA content and nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded mRNA and protein expression was observed in specific brain regions of LY344864-treated naïve and lesioned mice, indicating augmented MB. LY344864 attenuated TH-ir loss in the striatum and substantia nigra compared to vehicle-treated lesioned animals. LY344864 treatment also increased locomotor activity in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned mice, while vehicle treatment had no effect.These data revealed that LY344864-induced MB attenuates dopaminergic neuron loss and improves behavioural endpoints in this model. We suggest that stimulating MB may be beneficial for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and that the 5-HT receptor may be an effective therapeutic target.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526248>Centromere protein F (CENPF), a microtubule binding protein, modulates cancer metabolism by regulating pyruvate kinase M2 phosphorylation signaling.</a></h2><p>Prostate cancer (PC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and is the second leading cause of male cancer-related death in North America. Metabolic adaptations in malignant PC cells play a key role in fueling the growth and progression of the disease. Unfortunately, little is known regarding these changes in cellular metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that centromere protein F (CENPF), a protein associated with the centromere-kinetochore complex and chromosomal segregation during mitosis, is mechanically linked to altered metabolism and progression in PC. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we silenced the gene for CENPF in human PC3 cells. These cells were found to have reduced levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Silencing of CENPF also simultaneously improved sensitivity to anoikis-induced apoptosis. Mass spectrometry analysis of  phosphorylated proteins from CENPF knockout (CENPF) and control cells revealed that CENPF silencing increased inactive forms of pyruvate kinase M2, a rate limiting enzyme needed for an irreversible reaction in glycolysis. Furthermore, CENPF cells had reduced global bio-energetic capacity, acetyl-CoA production, histone acetylation, and lipid metabolism, suggesting that CENPF is a critical regulator of cancer metabolism, potentially through its effects on mitochondrial functioning. Additional quantitative immunohistochemistry and imaging analyzes on a series of PC tumor microarrays demonstrated that CENPF expression is significantly increased in higher-risk PC patients.

An early-onset form of Parkinson's disease is associated with mutations in the PINK1 kinase and PRKN ubiquitin ligase genes. PINK1 and Parkin (encoded by PRKN) are involved in the clearance of damaged  in cultured cells, but recent evidence obtained using knockout and knockin mouse models have led to contradictory results regarding the contributions of PINK1 and Parkin to mitophagy in vivo. It has previously been shown that PINK1 and Parkin have a key role in adaptive immunity by repressing presentation of mitochondrial antigens, which suggests that autoimmune mechanisms participate in the aetiology of Parkinson's disease. Here we show that intestinal infection with Gram-negative bacteria in Pink1 mice engages mitochondrial antigen presentation and autoimmune mechanisms that elicit the establishment of cytotoxic -specific CD8 T cells in the periphery and in the brain. Notably, these mice show a sharp decrease in the density of dopaminergic axonal varicosities in the striatum and are affected by motor impairment that is reversed after treatment with L-DOPA. These data support the idea that PINK1 is a repressor of the immune system, and provide a pathophysiological model in which intestinal infection acts as a triggering event in Parkinson's disease, which highlights the relevance of the gut-brain axis in the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29645350>Degradation of altered  by autophagy is impaired in Lafora disease.</a></h2><p>Lafora disease (LD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused mostly by mutations in either of two genes encoding laforin and malin. LD is characterized by accumulation of a poorly branched form of glycogen in the cytoplasm of neurons and other cells. We previously reported dysfunctional  in different LD models. Now, using mitochondrial uncouplers and respiratory chain inhibitors, we have investigated with human fibroblasts a possible alteration in the selective degradation of damaged  (mitophagy) in LD. By flow cytometry of MitoTracker-labelled cells and measuring the levels of various mitochondrial proteins by western blot, we found in LD fibroblasts a partial impairment in the increased mitochondrial degradation produced by these treatments. In addition, colocalization of mitochondrial and lysosomal markers decreased in LD fibroblasts. All these results are consistent with a partial impairment in the induced autophagic degradation of dysfunctional  in LD fibroblasts. However, canonical recruitment of Parkin to  under these conditions remained unaffected in LD fibroblasts, and also in SH-SY5Y cells after malin and laforin overexpression. Neither mitochondrial localization nor protein levels of Bcl-2-like protein 13, another component of the mitophagic machinery that operates under these conditions, were affected in LD fibroblasts. In contrast, although these treatments raised autophagy in both control and LD fibroblasts, this enhanced autophagy was clearly lower in the latter cells. Therefore, the autophagic degradation of altered  is impaired in LD, which is due to a partial defect in the autophagic response and not in the canonical mitophagy signalling pathways.© 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30636550>EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) Signaling and the  Regulate sFlt-1 (Soluble FMS-Like  Kinase-1) Secretion.</a></h2><p>Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy characterized by maternal endothelial dysfunction and end-organ damage. The antiangiogenic factor, sFlt-1 (soluble FMS-like  kinase-1) has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. sFlt-1 is secreted into the maternal circulation where it antagonizes VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and ultimately disrupts vascular homeostasis. However, the upstream mechanisms regulating release of sFlt-1 are poorly characterized. We investigated the roles of key prosurvival pathways, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) signaling, and the , in regulating sFlt-1 production. We initially found that the mRNA and protein of EGFR and downstream adaptor molecules were significantly increased in preeclamptic placental tissue relative to normotensive controls. Inhibiting the EGFR signaling cascade using siRNA (small interfering ribonucleic acid) or small molecule inhibitors significantly reduced sFlt-1 release from primary cytotrophoblast (placental cells). Additionally, inhibiting the mitochondrial electron transport chain or activating downstream energy-sensing molecules (AMPK [AMP-activated kinase], SIRT1 [sirtuin 1 ], and PGC1α [PPAR-γ co-activator 1]) also significantly reduced sFlt-1 secretion from cytotrophoblast cells, without affecting EGFR signaling. In vivo, treating pregnant mice with gefitinib (an EGFR inhibitor) or resveratrol (perturbs mitochondrial function) significantly reduced circulating murine sFlt-1 compared with vehicle control. Furthermore, treating primary cytotrophoblasts with therapeutics which have been previously found to reduce sFlt-1 secretion, either reduced EGFR signaling (esomeprazole and statins) or perturbed mitochondrial function (esomeprazole, resveratrol, and metformin). Additionally, targeting both pathways simultaneously produced additive reductions in sFlt-1 secretion. Thus, we have identified 2 key survival pathways that seem to be overactive in preeclampsia and involved in the regulation of placental sFlt-1 secretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28966246>Synergistic Inhibition of Breast Cancer Cell Growth by an Epigenome-Targeting Drug and a  Kinase Inhibitor.</a></h2><p>Epigenome-targeting drugs, for example, histone decetylases (HDACs) inhibitors, have been recently shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells, which could potentially be used as anticancer therapy.  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been widely used in clinical trials of various cancers. HDAC inhibitor vorinostat, TKIs dasatinib have been tested in pivotal phase 2 clinical trials in patients with breast cancer. The combination treatment of vorinostat with dasatinib is expected to have synergistic effect on inhibiting breast cancer cell growth.Antiproliferation effects of the combined drugs on MCF-7 cells were designed according to Chou-Talalay method and analyzed with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell-cycle perturbation and cell apoptosis induction of the combination drugs were examined by Flow cytometry. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the expression of Bcl-2 were determined by Western blot.Our results revealed that the combination treatment had synergistic effects on anti-MCF7 cells, enhanced G/M cell arrest, the generation of ROS, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell apoptosis in MCF-7 cells in synergy. Moreover, the combination treatment decreased Bcl-2 expression.Our results demonstrated that the combination of vorinostat with dasatinib exerted synergistic anticancer effects on MCF-7 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest, ROS production, and apoptosis through the -mediated intrinsic pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29312503>Biomimetic peptides protect cells from oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Most degenerative diseases are caused by free radicals. Antioxidin-RL peptide is a free radical scavenger found in the skin of plateau frog , which is more stable than vitamin C as it resists light-induced degradation. However, whether and how antioxidin-RL protects cells from oxidative stress was not clear. Here we addressed this issue, and in addition, we designed a series of antioxidin cognates by adding  residues to enhance free radical-binding capability. We performed free radical-clearing assays in solution to screen the mutants, and found a mutant antioxidin-2 that was as stable as antioxidin-RL and cleared free radical faster. By using PC-12 cells as a model, we demonstrated that both antioxidin-2 and antioxidin-RL inhibited the accumulation of intracellular free radicals triggered by HO, reduced  membrane potential dissipation, maintained mitochondrial morphology, and decreased the expression of dynamin-related protein-1 in , with antioxidin-RL more effective. Antioxidin-RL also attenuated the changes in SOD1 and GPx1 expression induced by HO. These findings provide insight into the anti-oxidative mechanisms of antioxidin-RL and its derivatives, which will provide rational basis for the development of more effective antioxidants to cure diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30139932>Effectiveness of EGFR/HER2-targeted drugs is influenced by the downstream interaction shifts of PTPIP51 in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer is the most common female cancerous disease and the second most cause of cancer death in women. About 20-30% of these tumors exhibit an amplification of the HER2/ErbB2 receptor, which is coupled to a more aggressive and invasive growth of the cancer cells. Recently developed  kinase inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies targeting the HER2 receptor improved the overall survival time compared with sole radio- and chemotherapy. Upcoming resistances against the HER2-targeted therapy make a better understanding of the receptor associated downstream pathways an absolute need. In earlier studies, we showed the involvement of Protein  Phosphatase Interacting Protein 51 (PTPIP51) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The MAPK pathway is one of the most frequently overactivated pathways in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells. This study is aimed to elucidate the effects of four different TKIs on the interactome of PTPIP51, namely with the receptors EGFR and HER2, 14-3-3/Raf1 (MAPK pathway), its regulating enzymes, and the -associated interaction partners in HER2 breast cancer cell lines (SK-BR3 and BT474) by using the Duolink proximity ligation assay, immunoblotting and knockdown of PTPIP51. Inhibition of both EGFR and HER2/ErbB2R shifted PTPIP51 into the MAPK pathway, but left the -associated interactome of PTPIP51 unattended. Exclusively inhibiting HER2/ErbB2 by Mubritinib did not affect the interaction of PTPIP51 with the MAPK signaling. Selective inhibition of HER2 induced great alterations of -associated interactions of PTPIP51, which ultimately led to the most-effective reduction of cell viability of SK-BR3 cells of all tested TKIs. The results clearly reveal the importance of knowing the exact mechanisms of the inhibitors affecting receptor  kinases in order to develop more efficient anti-HER2-targeted therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29019940>Effects of Extremely Low Frequency Electromagnetic Fields on Melanogenesis through p-ERK and p-SAPK/JNK Pathways in Human Melanocytes.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated frequency-dependent effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) on melanogenesis by melanocytes in vitro. Melanocytes were exposed to 2 mT EMFs at 30-75 Hz for 3 days before melanogenesis was examined. Exposure to ELF-EMFs at 50 and 60 Hz induced melanogenic maturation without cell damage, without changing cell proliferation and mitochondrial activity. Melanin content and tyrosinase activity of cells exposed to 50 Hz were higher than in controls, and mRNA expression of tyrosinase-related protein-2 was elevated relative to controls at 50 Hz. Phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (p-CREB) levels were higher than controls in cells exposed to ELF-EMFs at 50-75 Hz. Immunohistochemical staining showed that melanocyte-specific markers (HMB45, Melan-A) were strongly expressed in cells exposed to EMFs at 50 and 60 Hz compared to controls. Thus, exposure to ELF-EMFs at 50 Hz could stimulate melanogenesis in melanocytes, through activation of p-CREB and p-p38 and inhibition of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase. The results may form the basis of an appropriate anti-gray hair treatment or be applied in a therapeutic device for inducing repigmentation in the skin of vitiligo patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29383811>An Intracellular H O -Responsive AIEgen for the Peroxidase-Mediated Selective Imaging and Inhibition of Inflammatory Cells.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory cells have gained widespread attention because inflammatory diseases increase the risk for many types of cancer. Therefore, it is urgent and important to implement detection and treatment methods for inflammatory cells. Herein, we constructed a theranostic probe with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics, in which tetraphenylethene (TPE) was modified with two  (Tyr) moieties. Owing to the H O -dependent, enzyme-catalyzed dityrosine formation, Tyr-containing TPE (TT) molecules crosslink through dityrosine linkages to induce the formation of hydrophobic aggregates, activating the AIE process in inflammatory cells that contain H O and overexpress myeloperoxidase. The emission turn-on resulting from the crosslinking of TT molecules could be used to distinguish between inflammatory and normal cells. Moreover, the massive TT aggregates induced  damage and cell apoptosis. This study demonstrates that the H O -responsive peroxidase-activated AIEgen holds great promise for inflammatory-cell selective imaging and inhibition.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The different functions of prohibitin are mediated by its cell compartment-specific attributes, which include acting as an adaptor molecule in membrane signaling, a scaffolding protein in , and a transcriptional co-regulator in the nucleus. However, the precise relationship between its distinct cellular localization and diverse functions remain largely unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that the phosphorylation of prohibitin plays a role in a number of cell signaling pathways and in intracellular trafficking. Herein, we discuss the known and potential importance of the site-specific phosphorylation of prohibitin in regulating these features. We will discuss this in the context of new evidence from tissue-specific transgenic mouse models of prohibitin, including a mutant prohibitin lacking a crucial  phosphorylation site. We conclude with the opinion that prohibitin can be used as a potential target for  kinase signal transduction-targeting therapy, including in insulin, growth factors, and immune signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30120245>Cell-penetrating artificial -targeting peptide-conjugated metallothionein 1A alleviates mitochondrial damage in Parkinson's disease models.</a></h2><p>An excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) relative to the antioxidant capacity causes oxidative stress, which plays a role in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Cold storage is suitable for easily transporting sperm as an alternative to the shipment of live animals. However, there is a technical limitation in that the fertility of cold-stored sperm declines within 3 days. To overcome this problem, we examined the protective effects of quercetin and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO and quercetin maintained the fertility and motility of cold-stored sperm for 10 days. In addition, quercetin attenuated the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential of cold-stored sperm during sperm preincubation, allowing the induction of capacitation, and it localized to the midpiece of sperm. Furthermore, DMSO and quercetin enhanced the level of  phosphorylation of cold-stored sperm. DMSO and quercetin have life-prolonging effects on sperm during cold storage. Cold storage using DMSO and quercetin will provide a robust system for internationally transporting valuable sperm samples.© The Author(s) 2017.

This study aimed to evaluate the potential of zebrafish larvae as translational model in metabolic profiling of DIRI. Zebrafish larvae were exposed to the lethal concentration for 10% of the larvae (LC10) or ½ LC10 of gentamicin, paracetamol and tenofovir as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir (TFV). Metabolites were extracted from whole larvae and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Principal component analysis showed that drug exposition to the LC10 of paracetamol, TFV, and TDF was the main source of the variance of the data. To identify the metabolites responsible for the toxic effects of the drugs, partial least squares discriminant analyses were built between the LC10 and ½ LC10 for each drug. Features with variable importance in projection> 1.0 were selected and Venn diagrams were built to differentiate between the common and drug specific metabolites of DIRI. Creatine, , glutamine, guanosine, hypoxanthine were identified as common metabolites, adenosine and tryptophan as paracetamol-specific and xanthine and oxidized glutathione as tenofovir-specific. Those metabolic changes can be associated with alterations in energy metabolism, xenobiotic detoxification and protein catabolism, all described in the human pathophysiology of DIRI. Thus, zebrafish proved to be a suitable model to characterize the metabolic changes associated with DIRI.

However, the mechanisms involved in the insulin resistance in offspring are still unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunction is related with insulin resistance. In , malonyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCAT) is the key enzyme of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and is estimated to contribute to insulin resistance. In this study, we aimed to examine the role of MCAT and its network in the umbilical cord blood in GDM-induced offspring insulin resistance.We isolated lymphocytes from umbilical cord vein blood in 6 GDM patients and 6 controls and examined the differences of RNA by RNA sequencing. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to measure mRNA and protein changes. Bisulfite genomic sequencing PCR was applied to detect DNA methylation.We found more than 400 genes were differentially regulated in the lymphocytes of umbilical cord blood from GDM patients and these genes were mainly enriched in immune system and endocrine system, which relate to mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance. MCAT closely related with PTPN1 (Protein  Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type1) and STAT5A (Signal Transducer And Activator of Transcription 5A), which were all increased in umbilical cord blood from GDM patients. Increase in MCAT may be due to decreased MCAT DNA methylation.MCAT and its network with PTPN1, STAT5A are regulated in umbilical cord blood affected by maternal intrauterine hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30084861>LC3-II may mediate ATR-induced mitophagy in dopaminergic neurons through SQSTM1/p62 pathway.</a></h2><p>Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamine-1,3,5-triazine; ATR) has been demonstrated to regulate autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins in doparminergic neuronal damage.

In vivo dopaminergic neuron degeneration model was set up with ATR treatment and confirmed by the behavioral responses and pathological analysis. Dopaminergic neuron cells were transfected with LC3-II siRNA and treated with ATR to observe cell survival and reactive oxygen species release. The process of mitochondrial autophagy and the neurotoxic effects of mitochondrial autophagy were detected by immunofluorescence assay, immunohistochemical analysis, real-time PCR, and western blot analysis. Results showed that after ATR treatment, the grip strength of Wistar rats was significantly decreased, and behavioral signs of anxiety were clearly observed. The mRNA and protein levels of  hydroxylase, LC3-II, PINK1, and Parkin were significantly decreased in ATR-induced rat dopaminergic neurons and PC-12 cells, while the mRNA expression and protein levels of SQSTM1/p62 and Parl were increased. Exposure to ATR also led to accumulation of autophagic lysosomes and autophagic bodies along with significantly decreased levels of dopaminergic neurons and alterations in mitochondrial homeostasis, which was reversed by LC3-II siRNA.

Current understanding of the role of mitochondrial ROS in health and disease has been limited by the lack of experimental strategies to selectively induce mitochondrial superoxide production. The recently-developed -targeted redox cycler MitoParaquat (MitoPQ) overcomes this limitation, and has proven effective in vitro and in Drosophila. Here we present an in vivo study of MitoPQ in the vertebrate zebrafish model in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), and in a human cell model of Huntington's disease (HD). We show that MitoPQ is 100-fold more potent than non-targeted paraquat in both cells and in zebrafish in vivo. Treatment with MitoPQ induced a parkinsonian phenotype in zebrafish larvae, with decreased sensorimotor reflexes, spontaneous movement and brain  hydroxylase (TH) levels, without detectable effects on heart rate or atrioventricular coordination. Motor phenotypes and TH levels were partly rescued with antioxidant or monoaminergic potentiation strategies. In a HD cell model, MitoPQ promoted mutant huntingtin aggregation without increasing cell death, contrasting with the complex I inhibitor rotenone that increased death in cells expressing either wild-type or mutant huntingtin. These results show that MitoPQ is a valuable tool for cellular and in vivo studies of the role of mitochondrial superoxide generation in redox biology, and as a trigger or co-stressor to model metabolic and neurodegenerative disease phenotypes.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

This study aimed to investigate the expression of TMEFF2 in human pancreatic cancer tissue and the effects of knockdown of TMEFF2 on cell, proliferation, and apoptosis in human pancreatic cell lines. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-five samples of human pancreatic tissue and adjacent normal pancreatic tissue, and five human pancreatic cancer cell lines, CAPAN1, ASPC1, BXPC3, SW1990, and CFPAC were studied. RNA expression, protein expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were studied using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and ﬂow cytometry, respectively. A co-immunoprecipitation assay evaluated protein interactions. RESULTS TMEFF2 expression was down-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissue compared with normal pancreas. In human pancreatic cancer cell lines, overexpression of TMEFF2 suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, suppressed the expression of p-STAT3, MCL1, VEGF and increased the expression of the -specific protein phosphatase, SHP-1. The co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that TMEFF2 interacted with SHP-1. Knockdown of expression of TMEFF2 resulted in the increased expression of p-STAT3, MCL1, and VEGF, increased cell proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis, which were reversed by overexpression of SHP-1.

We attempted to study whether betanin (a natural pigment) is able to mitigate some OPs-induced hepatotoxicity in primary rat hepatocytes. Cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione (GSH) depletion and mitochondrial depolarization were tested as toxicity markers. The outcomes revealed that betanin (25μM) significantly increased cell viability, plummeted ROS formation and LPO, restored cellular GSH reservoirs and protected  after chlorpyrifos (CPF) (300μM), diazinon (DZN) (600μM) and dichlrovos (DDVP) (400μM) treatment. Taken together, all data suggests the potential protective role of betanin in OPs-induced hepatotoxicity in which the mechanism appears to be inhibition of ROS formation and mitochondrial protection.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Consequently, treatment of GBM/GSC is generally regarded as very poor. This article provides a framework that is based on alterations in the regulation of the melatonergic pathways within  of GBM/GSC. It is proposed that the presence of high levels of -synthesized melatonin is toxic to GBM/GSC, with a number of processes in GBM/GSC acting to limit melatonin's synthesis in . One such factor is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which increases cytochrome P450 (CYP)1b1 in , leading to the 'backward' conversion of melatonin to -acetylserotonin (NAS). -acetylserotonin has some similar, but some important differential effects compared with melatonin, including its activation of the  receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor. TrkB activation is important to GBM/GSC survival and proliferation. A plethora of significant, but previously disparate, data on GBM/GSC can then be integrated within this framework, including miR-451, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mTOR, 14-3-3 proteins, sirtuins, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, and the kynurenine pathways.

The enzyme is also responsible for the tetrahydrofolate-independent cleavage of other β-hydroxy amino acids. In addition to being an essential player in the serine homeostasis, SHMT action is the main source of activated one-carbon units, which links SHMT activity with the control of cell proliferation. In plants, studies of SHMT enzymes are more complicated than of those of, e.g., bacterial or mammalian origins because plant genomes encode multiple SHMT isozymes that are targeted to different subcellular compartments: cytosol, , plastids, and nucleus. Here we report crystal structures of chloroplast-targeted SHMT from  (SHMT3). SHMT3 is a tetramer in solution, composed of two tight and obligate dimers. Our complexes with PLP internal aldimine, PLP-serine and PLP-glycine external aldimines, and PLP internal aldimine with a free glycine reveal structural details of the SHMT3-catalyzed reaction.

How ULK1 kinase is targeted and activated during selective autophagic events remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used chemically inducible dimerization (CID) assays in tandem with CRISPR KO lines to systematically analyze the molecular basis of selective autophagosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that ectopic placement of NDP52 on  or peroxisomes is sufficient to initiate selective autophagy by focally localizing and activating the ULK1 complex. The capability of NDP52 to induce mitophagy is dependent on its interaction with the FIP200/ULK1 complex, which is facilitated by TBK1. Ectopically tethering ULK1 to cargo bypasses the requirement for autophagy receptors and TBK1. Focal activation of ULK1 occurs independently of AMPK and mTOR. Our findings provide a parsimonious model of selective autophagy, which highlights the coordination of ULK1 complex localization by autophagy receptors and TBK1 as principal drivers of targeted autophagosome biogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), located on the mitochondrial inner membrane, is the major channel responsible for mitochondrial Ca uptake. Activated proline-rich  kinase 2 (Pyk2) can directly phosphorylate MCU, which enhances mitochondrial Ca uptake in cardiomyocytes. It has been suggested that the Pyk2/MCU pathway may be a novel therapeutic target in stress-induced cellular apoptosis. In this study, we explored the role of the Pyk2/MCU pathway in the ischemic brain following a stroke injury. We found that the Pyk2/MCU pathway is activated in a rat cerebral ischemia model, and is responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. Inhibiting the Pyk2/MCU pathway with a Pyk2 inhibitor (PF-431396) prevented mitochondrial Ca overload, mitochondrial injury, proapoptotic protein release, and cell death. Interestingly, human urinary kallidinogenase (HUK) alleviated neuronal ischemic injury by inhibiting the Pyk2/MCU pathway, suggesting that the Pyk2/MCU pathway may be a protective target for ischemic stroke treatment.Copyright © 2017.

Reactive oxygen species are formed as a byproduct of these reactions, which can lead to mitochondrial damage followed by cell degeneration and death. In this study, we investigated the effects of administration of the mitochondrial antioxidant SkQ1 on biochemical, immunohistochemical, and behavioral parameters in a Parkinson-like condition caused by protoxin MPTP injections in C57BL/6 mice. SkQ1 administration increased dopamine quantity and decreased signs of sensory-motor deficiency as well as destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area in mice with the Parkinson-like condition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30078005>Pyr3 Induces Apoptosis and Inhibits Migration in Human Glioblastoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma, also known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is a fast-growing type of tumor that is the most aggressive brain malignancy in adults. According to GEO profile analysis, patients with high transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3) expression have poor survival rates. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Ethyl-1-(4-(2,3,3-trichloroacrylamide)phenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylate (Pyr3), a selective TRPC3 channel blocker, on the proliferation and migration of human glioblastoma cells.We first analyzed the TRPC3 mRNA expression in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, TRPC3 protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting in three human GBM cell lines. The survival rate was measured by sulforhodamine B. JC1 staining was used to analyze the  membrane potential by flow cytometric analysis. Besides, the migration and invasion were evaluated by wound healing and Transwell assays. Annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D staining was used to monitor the apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis. The expression of apoptotic-related and migration-related proteins after Pyr3 treatment was detected by Western blotting. In addition, an orthotropic xenograft mouse model was used to assay the effect of Pyr3 in the in vivo study.Basis on the results of bioinformatics study, glioma patients with higher TRPC3 expression had a shorter survival time than those with lower TRPC3 expression. GBM cell proliferation was decreased by Pyr3 treatment. The migration and invasion abilities of glioma cells were also inhibited via focal adhesion kinase and myosin light chain dephosphorization after Pyr3 treatment. Moreover, Pyr3 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and  membrane potential imbalance in the GBM cells. In a xenograft animal model, Pyr3 in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) inhibited GBM tumor growth.Pyr3 inhibited GBM tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Pyr3-TMZ combination therapy could be used to treat glioblastoma in the future.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are implicated in a host of myeloid malignancies, providing the rationale for strategies aimed at neutralizing IAPs to lower the cancer cell apoptosis threshold. Modes of IAP antagonism may include down-regulating IAP expression, up-regulating endogenous pro-apoptotic proteins, such as tumour necrosis factor-α or Fas ligand, or directly antagonizing IAP activity against caspases. Direct targeting of IAPs using mimetics of the second -derived activator of caspase (SMAC) protein has shown therapeutic promise by sensitizing the effect of chemotherapy on malignant cells. In pre-clinical studies, SMAC mimetics have demonstrated broad synergistic activity with a wide range of therapeutics, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, receptor  kinase inhibitors, agents targeting death receptors and alternative mechanisms of cell death, such as necroptosis or autophagy and immune check point blockade. SMAC mimetics represent a novel approach for further investigation in patients with high-risk, chemo-refractory blood cancers, as single agents or in thoughtfully selected combinations. In this review, we discuss the development and therapeutic rationale of small molecule SMAC mimetics, with an emphasis on agents in clinical development for myeloid malignancies.© 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561065>Sulfasalazine decreases soluble fms-like  kinase-1 secretion potentially via inhibition of upstream placental epidermal growth factor receptor signalling.</a></h2><p>Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy with no available medical treatment. We recently reported sulfasalazine, an anti-inflammatory medication, to be a candidate therapeutic for preeclampsia. We showed sulfasalazine decreases placental secretion of soluble Fms-like  kinase-1 (sFlt-1), an anti-angiogenic factor strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. However, the cellular mechanism(s) by which sulfasalazine reduces placental sFlt-1 are yet to be determined. Recently we also reported that both the  and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathways regulate secretion of placental sFlt-1. In this study we sought to assess directly whether sulfasalazine's capacity to reduce sFlt-1 secretion may be mediated via EGFR or the .Using primary cytotrophoblast cells, we confirmed sulfasalazine reduced sFlt-1 secretion. Interestingly, when we measured the mRNA expression of EGFR, we found a reduction in EGFR expression which closely mirrored the changes in sFlt-1 secretion. At the protein level, sulfasalazine significantly reduced phosphorylated and active EGFR (phosphorylated/total) expression. Additionally, sulfasalazine significantly reduced the protein expression of ERK1/2 and STAT3 which are key adaptor molecules downstream of EGFR. Next, we assessed mitochondrial respiration following sulfasalazine treatment and found no effect on basal respiration, ATP production, proton leak or maximal respiration.Sulfasalazine reduces EGFR and down-stream signalling molecule expression coincident with reduced sFlt-1 secretion. EGFR signalling is a potential mechanism by which sulfasalazine decreases placental secretion of sFlt-1.

We here characterize the curative potential of BH3-mimetics differentially targeting mitochondrial BCL2-family members using a combination therapy approach with dexamethasone and  kinase inhibitors targeting BCR-ABL. In BCR-ABL + ALL BH3-mimetics act by redistribution of mitochondrial activator BIM, which is strongly required for cytotoxicity of the BCL2-specific BH3-mimetic ABT-199,  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and dexamethasone. BIM expression is enhanced by dexamethasone and TKIs and both synergize with ABT-199 in BCR-ABL + ALL. Triple combinations with ABT-199, dexamethasone and TKIs efficiently attenuate leukemia progression both in tissue culture and in primary cell xenotransplantation models. Notably, the dasatinib-containing combination led to treatment- and leukemia-free long-term survival in a BCR-ABL + mouse model. Finally, response to BH3-mimetics can be predicted for individual patients in a clinically relevant setting. These data demonstrate curative targeted and chemotherapy-free pharmacotherapy for BCR-ABL + ALL in a preclinical model. Clinical evaluation, in particular for patients not suitable for allogeneic SCT, is warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30637824>Muscle wasting and branched-chain amino acid, alpha-ketoglutarate, and ATP depletion in a rat model of liver cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to examine whether a rat model of liver cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is a suitable model of muscle wasting and alterations in amino acid metabolism in cirrhotic humans. Rats were treated by intragastric gavage of CCl4 or vehicle for 45 days. Blood plasma and different muscle types-tibialis anterior (mostly white fibres), soleus (red muscle) and extensor digitorum longus (white muscle) - were analysed at the end of the study. Characteristic biomarkers of impaired hepatic function were found in the plasma of cirrhotic animals. The weights and protein contents of all muscles of CCl4-treated animals were lower when compared with controls. Increased concentrations of glutamine (GLN) and aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and ) and decreased concentrations of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), glutamate (GLU), alanine and aspartate were found in plasma and muscles. In the soleus muscle, GLN increased more and GLU and BCAA decreased less than in the extensor digitorum and tibialis muscles. Increased chymotrypsin-like activity (indicating enhanced proteolysis) and decreased α-ketoglutarate and ATP levels were found in muscles of cirrhotic animals. ATP concentration also decreased in blood plasma. It is concluded that a rat model of CCl4-induced cirrhosis is a valid model for the investigation of hepatic cachexia that exhibits alterations in line with a theory of role of ammonia in pathogenesis of BCAA depletion, citric cycle and  dysfunction, and muscle wasting in cirrhotic subjects. The findings indicate more effective ammonia detoxification to GLN in red than in white muscles.© 2019 The Authors.

ASP3026 is in part effective by inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. Erythrocytes lack  and nuclei, key organelles in the execution of apoptosis, but are nevertheless able to enter suicidal death or eryptosis, which is characterized by cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the cell surface and by cell shrinkage. Eryptosis is triggered by cell stress, such as energy depletion, hyperosmotic shock, oxidative stress and excessive increase of cytosolic Ca2+ activity ([Ca2+]i). The present study explored, whether ASP3026 impacts on eryptosis.Human erythrocytes have been exposed to energy depletion (glucose withdrawal for 48 hours), oxidative stress (addition of 0.3 mM tert-butylhydroperoxide [tBOOH] for 50 min) or Ca2+ loading with Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (1 µM for 60 min) in absence and presence of ASP3026 (1-4 µg/ml). Flow cytometry was employed to quantify phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface from annexin-V-binding, and cell volume from forward scatter.Treatment with ASP3026 alone did not significantly modify annexin-V-binding or forward scatter. Energy depletion, oxidative stress and ionomycin, all markedly and significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding erythrocytes, and decreased the forward scatter. ASP3026 significantly blunted the effect of energy depletion and oxidative stress, but not of ionomycin on annexin-V-binding. ASP3026 did not significantly influence the effect of any maneuver on forward scatter.ASP3026 is a novel inhibitor of erythrocyte cell membrane scrambling following energy depletion and oxidative stress.© 2017 The Author(s).

Here we assessed the roles of AOX by imposing stress under normoxia in comparison to hypoxic conditions using AOX over expressing (AOX OE) and anti-sense (AOX AS) transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings and roots. Under normoxic conditions stress was induced with the defence elicitor flagellin (flg22). AOX OE reduced NO production whilst this was increased in AOX AS. Moreover AOX AS also exhibited an increase in superoxide and therefore peroxynitrite,  nitration suggesting that scavenging of NO by AOX can prevent toxic peroxynitrite formation under normoxia. In contrast, during hypoxia interestingly we found that AOX is a generator of NO. Thus, the NO produced during hypoxia, was enhanced in AOX OE and suppressed in AOX AS. Additionally, treatment of WT or AOX OE with the AOX inhibitor SHAM inhibited hypoxic NO production. The enhanced levels of NO correlated with expression of non-symbiotic haemoglobin, increased NR activity and ATP production. The ATP generation was suppressed in nia1,2 mutant and non symbiotic haemoglobin antisense line treated with SHAM. Taken together these results suggest that hypoxic NO generation mediated by AOX has a discrete role by feeding into the haemoglobin-NO cycle to drive energy efficiency under conditions of low oxygen tension.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Similar to bulk cancer cells and always existing in the interior of a solid tumor, there are also insurmountable barriers for the elimination of CSCs. To overcome these drawbacks, a versatile polyion complex was rationally designed, which can respond to a tumor microenvironment and exhibits a size-variable property, which allows it to possess remarkable tumor penetration capability and to accumulate around LCSCs. Protein  kinase 7 (PTK7) antibody mediated active targetability can facilitate the cellular uptake of triphenylphosphine-docetaxel (TD) and microRNA-31(miR-31) and the breakage of the disulfide bond can also enhance intracellular drug release.

Advances in Nanotechnology have provided useful new approaches and tools for antitumor chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying chitosan nanoparticles containing S-nitrosomercaptosuccinic acid ( S-nitroso-MSA-CS) induced cytotoxicity in melanoma cells. S-Nitroso-MSA-CS induced concentration-dependent cell death against B16-F10 tumor cells, whereas non-nitroso nanoparticles (CS or MSA-CS) did not induce significant cytotoxicity. Additionally, melanoma cells were more sensitive to cell death than normal melanocytes. S-Nitroso-MSA-CS-induced cytotoxicity exhibited features of caspase-dependent apoptosis, and it was associated with oxidative stress, characterized by increased mitochondrial superoxide production and oxidation of protein thiol groups. In addition,  nitration and cysteine S-nitrosylation of amino acid residues in cellular proteins were observed.

The AOX pathway plays an important role in stress tolerance and is induced by various metabolites and signals. Previously, several lines of evidence indicated that the AOX pathway prevents overproduction of superoxide and other reactive oxygen species. More recent evidence suggests that AOX also plays a role in regulation of nitric oxide (NO) production and signalling. The AOX pathway is induced under low phosphate, hypoxia, pathogen infections, and elicitor treatments. The induction of AOX under aerobic conditions in response to various stresses can reduce electron transfer through complexes III and IV and thus prevents the leakage of electrons to nitrite and the subsequent accumulation of NO. Excess NO under various stresses can inhibit complex IV; thus, the AOX pathway minimizes nitrite-dependent NO synthesis that would arise from enhanced electron leakage in the cytochrome pathway. By preventing NO generation, AOX can reduce peroxynitrite formation and  nitration. In contrast to its function under normoxia, AOX has a specific role under hypoxia, where AOX can facilitate nitrite-dependent NO production. This reaction drives the phytoglobin-NO cycle to increase energy efficiency under hypoxia.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Experimental Biology.

In this study, we focused on the metabolites that are released by prostate cancer cells (PCC), which could potentially attenuate T cell immunity.Prostate cancer cells (PCC) media (PCM) was used to treat T cells, and its impact on T cell signaling was evaluated. The molecular mechanism was further verified in vivo using mouse models. The clinical significance was determined using IHC in human clinical specimens. Liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC/MS-MS) was used to identify the metabolites that are released by PCC, which trigger T cells inactivation.PCM inhibits T cells proliferation and impairs their ability to produce inflammatory cytokines. PCM decreases ATP production and increases ROS production in T cells by inhibiting complex III of the electron transport chain. We further show that SHP1 as the key molecule that is upregulated in T cells in response to PCM, inhibition of which reverses the phenotype induced by PCM. Using metabolomics analysis, we identified 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) as a vital molecule that is released by PCC. P5C is responsible for suppressing T cells signaling by increasing ROS and SHP1, and decreasing cytokines and ATP production.

Defects at the level of  are also characteristic of heart failure. We assessed changes in cardiac insulin response and mitochondrial function in a model of pressure overload-induced heart failure.Rats underwent aortic banding to induce pressure overload. At 10 weeks, rats showed cardiac hypertrophy and pulmonary congestion, but left ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction were only evident after 20 weeks. This contractile impairment was accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction as shown by markedly reduced state 3 respiration of isolated . Aortic banding did not affect systemic insulin response. However, insulin-stimulated cardiac glucose uptake and glucose oxidation were significantly diminished at 10 and 20 weeks, which indicates cardiac insulin resistance starting before the onset of mitochondrial and contractile dysfunction. The impaired cardiac insulin action was related to a decrease in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor β. Consistently, we found elevated activity of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) at 10 and 20 weeks, which may blunt insulin action by dephosphorylating insulin receptor β. PTP1B activity was also significantly increased in left ventricular samples of patients with systolic dysfunction undergoing aortic valve replacement because of aortic stenosis.Pressure overload causes cardiac insulin resistance that precedes and accompanies mitochondrial and systolic dysfunction. Activation of PTP1B in the heart is associated with heart failure in both rats and humans and may account for cardiac insulin resistance.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), constitutively active in many GBM tumors, plays a major role in GBM tumor growth and represents a potential therapeutic target. We have previously documented that phospho-valproic acid (MDC-1112), which inhibits STAT3 activation, possesses strong anticancer properties in multiple cancer types. In this study, we explored the anticancer efficacy of MDC-1112 in preclinical models of GBM, and evaluated its mode of action. MDC-1112 inhibited the growth of multiple human GBM cell lines in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Normal human astrocytes were resistant to MDC-1112, indicating selectivity. In vivo, MDC-1112 reduced the growth of subcutaneous GBM xenografts in mice by up to 78.2% (p<0.01), compared to the controls. Moreover, MDC-1112 extended survival in an intracranial xenograft model. While all vehicle-treated mice died by 19 days of treatment, 7 out of 11 MDC-1112-treated mice were alive and healthy by the end of 5 weeks, with many showing tumor regression. Mechanistically, MDC-1112 inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at the serine 727 residue, but not at  705, in vitro and in vivo. STAT3 overexpression rescued GBM cells from the cell growth inhibition by MDC-1112. In addition, MDC-1112 reduced STAT3 levels in the  and enhanced mitochondrial levels of reactive oxygen species, which triggered apoptosis. In conclusion, MDC-1112 displays strong efficacy in preclinical models of GBM, with the serine 727 residue of STAT3 being its key molecular target.

Recently, neuroprotection via sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-dependent signalling has become a promising target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Our previous study demonstrated down-regulation and inhibition of the S1P-synthesizing enzyme sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) in a PD cellular model. Moreover, we have previously identified a neuroprotective effect of fingolimod (FTY720), a first S1P receptor modulator utilized in the clinic. This study focused on the effects of FTY720 and the dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist pramipexole (PPX) in a PD mouse model, induced by administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Administration of FTY720, similar to PPX, abolished an observed loss of  hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in MPTP-lesioned brain regions. Moreover, significant changes in SPHK1 expression/activity in MPTP-lesioned mouse midbrain were identified. PPX, but not FTY720 treatment, significantly protected against these alterations. Both drugs activate another pro-survival enzyme, Akt kinase, which is a crucial protein downstream of S1PR(s). FTY720 increased BAD protein phosphorylation and in this way may protect  against the BAD-induced apoptotic signalling pathway. Both FTY720 and PPX enhanced the locomotor activity of PD mice in the rotarod tests. Our data suggest a neuroprotective role for FTY720 related to the S1PR/Akt kinase signalling pathways as a beneficial treatment target in planning new PD therapeutic options. Moreover, our findings have shed new light on a neuroprotective mechanism of PPX action associated with SPHK1 activation, which provides an opportunity for evaluating multi-target (SPHK1/S1P/S1PR) effects in the context of PD.Copyright © 2018.

In addition, we used proteomics coupled with topographical heat-mapping to reveal that knockout of LYRM2 impairs assembly of the NADH-dehydrogenase module of complex I, leading to defects in cellular respiration.

Two regulators of this system are the Fer kinase, and its cancer cell specific variant, FerT, both residing in subcellular compartments including the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Here, we show that a newly developed inhibitor of Fer and FerT, E260, selectively evokes metabolic stress in cancer cells by imposing mitochondrial dysfunction and deformation, and onset of energy-consuming autophagy which decreases the cellular ATP level. Notably, Fer was also found to associate with PARP-1 and E260 disrupted this association thereby leading to PARP-1 activation. The cooperative intervention with these metabolic pathways leads to energy crisis and necrotic death in malignant, but not in normal human cells, and to the suppression of tumors growth in vivo. Thus, E260 is a new anti-cancer agent which imposes metabolic stress and cellular death in cancer cells.The -kinases Fer/FerT associate with the mitochondrial electron transport chain in cancer cells supporting their metabolic reprogramming.

Their role in cancer is largely context-dependent as they can both act as oncogenes and tumor suppressors. We review here the role of STAT3/5 activation in solid cancers and summarize their association with survival in cancer patients. The molecular mechanisms that underpin the oncogenic activity of STAT3/5 signaling include the regulation of genes that control cell cycle and cell death. However, recent advances also highlight the critical role of STAT3/5 target genes mediating inflammation and stemness. In addition, STAT3 mitochondrial functions are required for transformation. On the other hand, several tumor suppressor pathways act on or are activated by STAT3/5 signaling, including  phosphatases, the sumo ligase Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT3 (PIAS3), the E3 ubiquitin ligase TATA Element Modulatory Factor/Androgen Receptor-Coactivator of 160 kDa (TMF/ARA160), the miRNAs miR-124 and miR-1181, the Protein of alternative reading frame 19 (p19ARF)/p53 pathway and the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 and 3 (SOCS1/3) proteins. Cancer mutations and epigenetic alterations may alter the balance between pro-oncogenic and tumor suppressor activities associated with STAT3/5 signaling, explaining their context-dependent association with tumor progression both in human cancers and animal models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30370221>Bacterial bifunctional chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase PheA increases flux into the yeast phenylalanine pathway and improves mandelic acid production.</a></h2><p>Mandelic acid is an important aromatic fine chemical and is currently mainly produced via chemical synthesis. Recently, mandelic acid production was achieved by microbial fermentations using engineered  and  expressing heterologous hydroxymandelate synthases (). The best-performing strains carried a deletion of the gene encoding the first enzyme of the  biosynthetic pathway and therefore were auxotrophic for . This was necessary to avoid formation of the competing intermediate hydroxyphenylpyruvate, the preferred substrate for HmaS, which would have resulted in the predominant production of hydroxymandelic acid. However, feeding  to the medium would increase fermentation costs. In order to engineer a  prototrophic mandelic acid-producing  strain, we tested three strategies: (1) rational engineering of the HmaS active site for reduced binding of hydroxyphenylpyruvate, (2) compartmentalization of the mandelic acid biosynthesis pathway by relocating HmaS together with the two upstream enzymes chorismate mutase Aro7 and prephenate dehydratase Pha2 into  or peroxisomes, and (3) utilizing a feedback-resistant version of the bifunctional  enzyme PheA (PheA) in an  deletion strain. PheA has both chorismate mutase and prephenate dehydratase activity. Whereas the enzyme engineering approaches were only successful in respect to reducing the preference of HmaS for hydroxyphenylpyruvate but not in increasing mandelic acid titers, we could show that strategies (2) and (3) significantly reduced hydroxymandelic acid production in favor of increased mandelic acid production, without causing  auxotrophy. Using the bifunctional enzyme PheA turned out to be the most promising strategy, and mandelic acid production could be increased 12-fold, yielding titers up to 120 mg/L. Moreover, our results indicate that utilizing PheA also shows promise for other industrial applications with  that depend on a strong flux into the phenylalanine biosynthetic pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982665>NIPSNAP1 and NIPSNAP2 Act as "Eat Me" Signals for Mitophagy.</a></h2><p>The clearance of damaged or dysfunctional  by selective autophagy (mitophagy) is important for cellular homeostasis and prevention of disease. Our understanding of the mitochondrial signals that trigger their recognition and targeting by mitophagy is limited. Here, we show that the mitochondrial matrix proteins 4-Nitrophenylphosphatase domain and non-neuronal SNAP25-like protein homolog 1 (NIPSNAP1) and NIPSNAP2 accumulate on the  surface upon mitochondrial depolarization. There, they recruit proteins involved in selective autophagy, including autophagy receptors and ATG8 proteins, thereby functioning as an "eat me" signal for mitophagy. NIPSNAP1 and NIPSNAP2 have a redundant function in mitophagy and are predominantly expressed in different tissues. Zebrafish lacking a functional Nipsnap1 display reduced mitophagy in the brain and parkinsonian phenotypes, including loss of  hydroxylase (Th1)-positive dopaminergic (DA) neurons, reduced motor activity, and increased oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, its role in acute aortic dissection (AD) is not known yet. Using an aortic dissection model in SR-A1-deficient mice and their wild type littermates, we found that SR-A1 deficiency aggravated beta-aminopropionitrile monofumarate induced thoracic aortic dilation, false lumen formation, extracellular matrix degradation, vascular inflammation and accumulation of apoptotic cells. These pathological changes were associated with an impaired macrophage efferocytosis mediated by -protein kinase receptor Tyro3 in vitro and in vivo. SR-A1 could directly interact with Tyro3 and was required for Tyro3 phosphorylation to activate its downstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Importantly, co-culture of SR-A1 macrophages with apoptotic Jurkat cells resulted in less devoured apoptotic cells accompanied by swelling  and damaged ATP generation, following poor IL-10 and robust TNF-α production. Deficiency of SR-A1 did not influence phagolysosome formation during the efferocytosis. Lentiviral overexpression of Tyro3 in SR-A1 macrophages induced restorative phagocytosis in vitro. Administration of Tyro3 agonist protein S could restore SR-A1 macrophages phagocytosis in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that SR-A1-Tyro3 axis in macrophages mitigate AD damage by promoting efferocytosis and inhibiting inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, we have shown that Hyp presence alone, without illumination, resulted in substantial biological effects at several sub-cellular levels. Hyp induced changes in cellular ultrastructure,  function and metabolism, and distribution of Bcl2 proteins in malignant and non-malignant cells. The molecular mechanisms that underlie Hyp light-independent effects are still elusive. We have hypothesized that Bcl2-Hyp interactions might be one possible mechanism. We performed molecular docking studies to determine the Hyp-Bcl2 interaction profile. Based on the interaction profiles small Bcl2 peptide segments were selected for further study. We designed small peptides corresponding to Bcl2 BH3 and BH1 domains and tested the binding of Hyp and Bcl2 known inhibitor, ABT263, to the peptides in computer modeling and in vitro binding studies. We employed endogenous tryptophan and  in the BH3 and BH1 peptides, respectively, and their fluorescent properties to show interaction with Hyp and ABT263. Overall, our results indicate that Hyp can interact with Bcl2 protein at its BH3-BH1 hydrophobic groove, and this interaction may trigger changes in intracellular distribution of Bcl2 proteins. In addition, our computer modeling results suggest that Hyp also interacts with other anti-apoptotic members of Bcl2 family similar to the known BH3 mimetics. Our findings are novel and might contribute to understanding Hyp light-independent effects. In addition, they may substantiate the therapeutic use of Hyp as a BH3 mimetic molecule to enhance other cancer treatments.Copyright © 2019.

Depending on the agonist and cellular context, Ca can mediate different responses in the same cell [1]. The specific cellular response transduced downstream of the particular Ca transient is encoded in the spatial and temporal dynamics of the Ca signal, leading to the activation of a subset of Ca-dependent effectors and the ensuing cellular response. As such, the duration, amplitude, frequency, and spatial localization of Ca signals encode targeted signals that activate Ca-sensitive effectors to define a particular cellular response. To generate and fine-tune those Ca signals, cells use two main Ca sources: entry of extracellular Ca and Ca release from intracellular stores. The primary intracellular Ca store is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which can concentrate Ca in the hundreds of μM range [2]. In contrast, cytoplasmic Ca concentration is kept at rest at extremely low levels (∼100 nM or lower), thus providing a low-noise background for detection of complex Ca dynamics [3]. The Ca-signaling machinery includes Ca entry and extrusion pathways in the plasma membrane (PM), ER membrane Ca release channels, and Ca reuptake ATPases within the ER membrane [4]. These Ca transport pathways, in addition to intracellular Ca buffers and Ca uptake and release through other intracellular organelles, primarily the , combine to shape highly tuned and dynamic Ca transients that regulate cellular functions [5]. Under physiological conditions in non-excitable cells, Ca transients are typically initiated downstream of agonist stimulation through the activation of the PLC-IP signal transduction cascade, which leads to the opening of intracellular Ca channel inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IPRs) to release Ca from intracellular stores [6]. Ca release depletes the stores and activates a Ca influx pathway in the PM termed store-operated Ca entry (SOCE). SOCE is mediated by two key players: ER transmembrane Ca sensors represented by the STIM family of proteins and PM Ca channels of the Orai family that link directly to STIMs (see Chapters 1 through 3). The N-terminus of STIM1 faces the ER lumen and consists of two EF-hand domains that detect luminal Ca concentration. The loss of STIM1 Ca binding upon store depletion leads to conformational changes in the protein and its aggregation into clusters that translocate and stabilize into ER-PM junctions with very close apposition (∼20 nm) [7]. STIM1 within these ER-PM junctions binds to and recruits Orai1 through a diffusional trap mechanism, resulting in opening Orai1 channels and Ca entry [8]. As such, the STIM-Orai clusters at ER-PM junctions define a specific microdomain at ER-PM junctions that also include the ER Ca-ATPase (SERCA) [9,10]. The tightly regulated remodeling of the Ca-signaling machinery upon store depletion allows for specific Ca signaling in the midrange between Ca microdomains and global Ca waves [10] (see Chapter 5). Spatially, Ca signaling can occur in localized spatially restricted elementary Ca release events that activate effectors located in the immediate proximity of the Ca channel. Alternatively, Ca signals/waves occur/spread through the entire cell resulting in a global spatially unrestricted signal. We have recently described a SOCE-dependent Ca-signaling modularity that signals in the midrange between these two spatial extremes [10]. Store depletion downstream of receptor activation and IP generation results in a localized Ca entry point source at the SOCE clusters that induces Ca entry into the cytoplasm, which is readily taken up into the ER lumen through SERCA activity only to be released again through open IPRs distally to the SOCE entry site and gate Ca-activated Cl channels as downstream Ca effectors. This mechanism, referred to as “Ca teleporting,” allows for specific activation of Ca effectors that are distant from the point source Ca channel without inducing a global Ca wave, thus providing a novel module in the Ca-signaling repertoire. A cartoon summary of Ca teleporting is found in Figure 12.1. The relationship between Ca signaling and cellular proliferation is complex with Ca transients detected at various stages of the cell cycle [2]. These transients are thought to activate a multitude of Ca effectors downstream of the initial Ca signal, which were shown to be important for cellular proliferation, including, for example, calmodulin (CaM) and Ca-CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). However, there are a few cases where Ca signals have been shown directly to be critical for cell cycle progression, including in mitosis for nuclear envelope breakdown and for chromosome disjunction [11]. In contrast, nuclear envelope breakdown during meiosis in vertebrate oocytes occurs independently of Ca, but Ca is required for the completion of meiosis I in vertebrate oocytes [12–14]. Interestingly, multiple Ca signaling pathways are modified during M-phase of the cell cycle, with the best defined example being  oocyte maturation [15]. Several Ca influx pathways have been implicated in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, including TRP channels, voltage-gated Ca channels (Ca), purinergic P2X receptors, ionotropic glutamate receptors, and SOCE [16]. Blockers of voltage-gated Ca channels were shown to slow down cell growth, arguing for a role for these channels in cell cycle progression [16–18]. Experimental manipulation of the expression levels of members of the TRPC, TRPV, and TRPM families of cation channels, which are Ca permeable, was linked to cell proliferation with differential effects depending on the particular channel studied [16]. However, some of these studies are difficult to interpret because channel knockdown or overexpression could have significantly broader effects on Ca signaling than affecting Ca influx through the specific channel in question, as it may lead to changes in expression of other Ca-signaling pathways as a compensatory mechanism. Furthermore, the majority of TRP channels conduct cations with some Ca permeability and are not Ca selective like Orai1 or Ca channels, with the exception of TRPV5 and TRPV6 (see Chapter 13). Hence, changes in their expression is likely to affect the ionic balance across the cell membrane with effects on resting membrane potential, which may in turn affect cell proliferation. The relationship between SOCE and cell proliferation is an intimate one that goes beyond the well-recognized roles of Ca signaling in cellular growth and proliferation. SOCE is dramatically downregulated during the division phase of the cell cycle through mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. This is in line with the significant remodeling of the Ca-signaling machinery during M-phase, which has been well characterized during oocyte meiosis. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence from multiple neoplasms for an important role for SOCE in metastasis. This chapter presents a brief overview of our current knowledge as to the mechanisms regulating SOCE during cell cycle from cellular proliferation to metastasis with an emphasis on SOCE regulation during cell division (mitosis and meiosis).© 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294239>KM-34, a Novel Antioxidant Compound, Protects against 6-Hydroxydopamine-Induced Mitochondrial Damage and Neurotoxicity.</a></h2><p>The etiology of Parkinson's disease is not completely understood and is believed to be multifactorial. Neuronal disorders associated to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are widely considered major consequences. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the synthetic arylidenmalonate derivative 5-(3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (KM-34), in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Pretreatment (2 h) with KM-34 (1 and 10 μM) markedly attenuated 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. KM-34 also inhibited HO generation, mitochondrial swelling, and membrane potential dissipation after 6-OHDA-induced mitochondrial damage. In vivo, KM-34 treatment (1 and 2 mg/Kg) reduced percentage of asymmetry (cylinder test) and increased the vertical exploration (open field) with respect to untreated injured animals; KM-34 also reduced glial fibrillary acidic protein overexpression and increased  hydroxylase-positive cell number, both in substantia nigra pars compacta. These results demonstrate that KM-34 present biological effects associated to mitoprotection and neuroprotection in vitro, moreover, glial response and neuroprotection in SNpc in vivo. We suggest that KM-34 could be a putative neuroprotective agent for inhibiting the progressive neurodegenerative disease associated to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872782>Skeletal muscle toxicity associated with  kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29983397>Multitargeted kinase inhibitors imatinib, sorafenib and sunitinib perturb energy metabolism and cause cytotoxicity to cultured C2C12 skeletal muscle derived myotubes.</a></h2><p> kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have advanced cancer treatment and prognosis but have also resulted in adverse effects such as fatigue, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, and other toxicities. We investigated TKI effects on skeletal muscle as a possible explanation of TKI induced fatigue. Changes in mitochondrial function due to inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, generation of superoxides, and inhibition of key transporters involved in uptake of glucose and/or nucleosides may result in alteration of energy metabolism and/or mitochondrial function. We investigated effects of imatinib, sorafenib and sunitinib on these processes in cultured C2C12 murine skeletal muscle cells. Imatinib, sorafenib and sunitinib were cytotoxic to C2C12 cells with IC values of 20, 8 and 8 µM, respectively. Imatinib stimulated glucose uptake and inhibited complex V activity by 35% at 50 µM. Sorafenib inhibited complex II/III and V with IC values of 32 and 28 µM, respectively. Sorafenib caused activation of caspase 3/7 and depolarization of mitochondrial membranes occurred very rapidly with complete loss at 5-10 µM. Sunitinib inhibited Complex I with an IC value of 38 µM and caused ATP depletion, caspase 3/7 activation, an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), and decreased nucleoside and glucose uptake. In conclusion, imatinib, sunitinib and sorafenib caused changes in mitochondrial complex activities, glucose and nucleoside uptake leading to decreased energy production and mitochondrial function in a skeletal muscle cell model, suggesting that these changes may play a role in fatigue, one of the most common adverse effects of TKIs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To assess metabolic status under zonisamide treatment in PD, we performed a pilot study using a comprehensive metabolome analysis. Plasma samples were collected for at least one year from 30 patients with PD: 10 without zonisamide medication and 20 with zonisamide medication. We performed comprehensive metabolome analyses of plasma with capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We also measured disease severity using Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) staging and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor section, and analyzed blood chemistry. In PD with zonisamide treatment, 15 long-chain acylcarnitines (LCACs) tended to be increased, of which four (AC(12:0), AC(12:1)-1, AC(16:1), and AC(16:2)) showed statistical significance. Of these, two LCACs (AC(16:1) and AC(16:2)) were also identified by partial least squares analysis. There was no association of any LCAC with age, disease severity, levodopa daily dose, or levodopa equivalent dose. Because an upregulation of LCACs implies improvement of mitochondrial β-oxidation, zonisamide might be beneficial for mitochondrial β-oxidation, which is suppressed in PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29307080>Inhibition of Peroxynitrite-Induced Mitophagy Activation Attenuates Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.</a></h2><p>Activated autophagy/mitophagy has been intensively observed in ischemic brain, but its roles remain controversial. Peroxynitrite (ONOO), as a representative of reactive nitrogen species, is considered as a critical neurotoxic factor in mediating cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, but its roles in autophagy/mitophagy activation remain unclear. Herein, we hypothesized that ONOO could induce PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy activation via triggering dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) recruitment to damaged , contributing to cerebral I/R injury. Firstly, we found PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy activation was predominant among general autophagy, leading to rat brain injury at the reperfusion phase after cerebral ischemia. Subsequently, increased nitrotyrosine was found in the plasma of ischemic stroke patients and ischemia-reperfused rat brains, indicating the generation of ONOO in ischemic stroke. Moreover, in vivo animal experiments illustrated that ONOO was dramatically increased, accompanied with mitochondrial recruitment of Drp1, PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy activation, and progressive infarct size in rat ischemic brains at the reperfusion phase. FeTMPyP, a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, remarkably reversed mitochondrial recruitment of Drp1, mitophagy activation, and brain injury. Intriguingly, further study revealed that ONOO induced  nitration of Drp1 peptide, which might contribute to mitochondrial recruitment of Drp1 for mitophagy activation. In vitro cell experiments yielded consistent results with in vivo animal experiments. Taken together, all above findings support the hypothesis that ONOO-induced mitophagy activation aggravates cerebral I/R injury via recruiting Drp1 to damaged .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634150>Beneficial effects of PGC-1α in the substantia nigra of a mouse model of MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are closely associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) is thought to play multiple roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular energy metabolism. We recently reported that altering PGC-1α gene expression modulates mitochondrial functions in N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP) treated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, possibly via the regulation of Estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression. In the present study, we aimed to further investigate the potential beneficial effects of PGC-1α in the substantia nigra of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated C57BL mice.The overexpression or knockdown of the PGC-1α gene in the mouse model of dopaminergic neurotoxicity was performed using a stereotactic injection of lentivirus in MPTP-treated male C57BL/6 mice. Mice were randomly assigned to one of 6 groups (n=24 per group): normal saline (NS) intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) (con); MPTP i.p. (M); solvent of the lentivirus striatal injection (lentivirus control) + MPTP i.p. (LVcon+M); lentivirus striatal injection + MPTP i.p. (LV+M); LV-PGC-1α striatum injection + MPTP i.p. (LVPGC+M); and LV-PGC-1α-siRNA striatal injection + MPTP i.p. (LVsiRNA+M). Intraperitoneal injections of MPTP/NS were conducted two weeks after lentivirus injection.We found significant improvement in motor behavior and increases in  hydroxylase expression in the substantia nigra (SN) in the brains of mice in the LVPGC+M group. The opposite tendency was observed in those in the LVsiRNA+M group. The expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the SN region was also consistent with the changes in PGC-1α expression. Electron microscopy showed an increasing trend in the mitochondrial density in the LVPGC+M group and a decreasing trend in the M and LVsiRNA+M groups compared to that in the controls.Our results indicated that PGC-1α rescues the effects of MPTP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in C57BL mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661838>Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 3 is Critical for α-Synuclein Uptake and MPP-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Cultured Dopaminergic Neurons.</a></h2><p>α-Synuclein is an abundant neuronal protein that accumulates in insoluble inclusions in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. Fatty acids partially regulate α-Synuclein accumulation, and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons highly express fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3). We previously demonstrated that FABP3 knockout mice show decreased α-Synuclein oligomerization and neuronal degeneration of  hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons . In this study, we newly investigated the importance of FABP3 in α-Synuclein uptake, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)-induced axodendritic retraction, and mitochondrial dysfunction. To disclose the issues, we employed cultured mesencephalic neurons derived from wild type or FABP3 C57BL6 mice and performed immunocytochemical analysis. We demonstrated that TH neurons from FABP3 mice take up α-Synuclein monomers while FABP3 TH neurons do not. The formation of filamentous α-Synuclein inclusions following treatment with MPP was observed only in FABP3, and not in FABP3 neurons. Notably, detailed morphological analysis revealed that FABP neurons did not exhibit MPP-induced axodendritic retraction. Moreover, FABP3 was also critical for MPP-induced reduction of mitochondrial activity and the production of reactive oxygen species. These data indicate that FABP3 is critical for α-Synuclein uptake in dopaminergic neurons, thereby preventing synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29150439>Suppression of FIP200 and autophagy by tumor-derived lactate promotes naïve T cell apoptosis and affects tumor immunity.</a></h2><p>Naïve T cells are poorly studied in cancer patients. We report that naïve T cells are prone to undergo apoptosis due to a selective loss of FAK family-interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200) in ovarian cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice. This results in poor antitumor immunity via autophagy deficiency,  overactivation, and high reactive oxygen species production in T cells. Mechanistically, loss of FIP200 disables the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members via enhanced argonaute 2 (Ago2) degradation, reduced Ago2 and microRNA1198-5p complex formation, less microRNA1198-5p maturation, and consequently abolished microRNA1198-5p-mediated repression on apoptotic gene  Bcl-2 overexpression and  complex I inhibition rescue T cell apoptosis and promoted tumor immunity. Tumor-derived lactate translationally inhibits FIP200 expression by down-regulating the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide level while potentially up-regulating the inhibitory effect of adenylate-uridylate-rich elements within the 3' untranslated region of  mRNA. Thus, tumors metabolically target naïve T cells to evade immunity.Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) is a critical factor in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. A variety of posttranslational modifications of Drp1 have been reported, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and S-nitrosylation. In this study, we found that c-Abl phosphorylated Drp1 at  266, 368 and 449 in vitro and in vivo, which augmented the GTPase activity of Drp1 and promoted Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation. Consistently, c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation is important for GTPase activity of Drp1 and mitochondrial fragmentation. Furthermore, we found that Drp1 phosphorylation mediated by c-Abl is required for oxidative stress-induced cell death in primary cortical neurons. Taken together, our findings reveal that c-Abl-Drp1 signaling pathway regulates oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death, which might be a potential target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29446053>Systems pharmacological analysis of mitochondrial cardiotoxicity induced by selected  kinase inhibitors.</a></h2><p> kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are targeted therapies rapidly becoming favored over conventional cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. Our study investigates two FDA approved TKIs, DASATINIB; indicated for IMATINIB-refractory chronic myeloid leukemia, and SORAFENIB; indicated for hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma. Limited but crucial evidence suggests that these agents can have cardiotoxic side effects ranging from hypertension to heart failure. A greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of this cardiotoxicity are needed as concerns grow and the capacity to anticipate them is lacking. The objective of this study was to explore the mitochondrial-mediated cardiotoxic mechanisms of the two selected TKIs. This was achieved experimentally using immortalized human cardiomyocytes, AC16 cells, to investigate dose- and time-dependent cell killing, along with measurements of temporal changes in key signaling proteins involved in the intrinsic apoptotic and autophagy pathways upon exposure to these agents. Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models were developed to capture the toxicological response in AC16 cells using protein dynamic data. The developed QSP models captured well all the various trends in protein signaling and cellular responses with good precision on the parameter estimates, and were successfully qualified using external data sets. An interplay between the apoptotic and autophagic pathways was identified to play a major role in determining toxicity associated with the investigated TKIs. The established modeling platform showed utility in elucidating the mechanisms of cardiotoxicity of SORAFENIB and DASATINIB. It may be useful for other small molecule targeted therapies demonstrating cardiac toxicities, and may aid in informing alternate dosing strategies to alleviate cardiotoxicity associated with these therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31124333>Induction of Melanoma Cell-Selective Apoptosis Using Anti-HER2 Antibody-Conjugated Gold Nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to verify the induction and mechanism of selective apoptosis in G361 melanoma cells using anti-HER2 antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles (GNP-HER2).Following GNP-HER2 treatment of G361 cells, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were measured by WST-1 assay, Hemacolor staining, Hoechst staining, immunofluorescence staining, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and Western blotting.G361 cells treated with GNP-HER2 showed condensation of nuclei, which is an apoptotic phenomenon, and translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor and cytochrome c from  into the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. Increases in BAX in cells undergoing apoptosis, activation of caspase-3 and -9, and fragmentation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA fragmentation factor 45 (inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase) were observed upon GNP-HER2 treatment. Following GNP-HER2 treatment, an increase of cells in sub-G1 phase, which is a signal of cell apoptosis, was observed. This resulted in the down-regulation of cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, cdk2, cdk4, and cdc2 and the up-regulation of p21. Thus, GNP-HER2 treatment was confirmed to induce the cessation of cell cycle progression. Also, decreases in phospho-focal adhesion kinase and phospho-human epidermal growth factor receptor, which activate cellular focal adhesion, and decreases in phospho-paxillin, which stimulates the disassembly of filamentous actin, were observed. Reduced cell adhesion and disassembly of the intracellular structure indicated cell deactivation.GNP-HER2 can selectively kill G361 melanoma cells without affecting normal cells. The mechanism of G361 cell death upon treatment with GNP-HER2 was apoptosis accompanied by activation of caspases.© Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30479840>Survival of midbrain dopamine neurons depends on the Bcl2 factor Mcl1.</a></h2><p>-dependent apoptosis plays an important role in the embryonic development of the midbrain dopaminergic system as well as in Parkinson's disease. Central to -dependent apoptosis is the Bcl2 family of apoptosis-regulating proteins. However, it was unclear which Bcl2 proteins are important for the survival of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we identify Mcl1 as a critical Bcl2 pro-survival factor in midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Using a chemical biology approach to inhibit various components of the apoptotic machinery in the dopaminergic MN9D cell line or the control neuroblastoma N2A cell line, we find that functional inhibition of Mcl1 with the high affinity small molecule inhibitor UMI-77 results in a rapid and dose-dependent loss of viability, selectively in dopaminergic cells. In-depth analysis of the apoptotic signaling pathway reveals that chemical inhibition of Mcl1 results in the activation of Bax, activation of cleaved caspase-3 and finally cell death. The dependence of mouse dopaminergic midbrain neurons on Mcl1 was confirmed using ex vivo slice cultures from Pitx3GFP/+ and wildtype mice. In mouse dopaminergic midbrain neurons positive for the midbrain dopaminergic marker Pitx3, or  hydroxylase, UMI-77 treatment caused a dramatic increase in cleaved caspase 3, indicating that Mcl1 activity is required for basal neuronal survival. Overall, our results suggest that Mcl1 is of critical importance to dopaminergic neurons and is a weak link in the chain controlling cellular survival. Boosting the pro-survival function of Mcl1 should be pursued as a therapeutic approach to augment the resilience of midbrain dopaminergic neurons to apoptotic stress in Parkinson's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29895494>Neuroprotective effect of a standardized extract of Centella asiatica ECa233 in rotenone-induced parkinsonism rats.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation cause dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. The neuroprotective approach is a promising strategy to slow disease progression in Parkinson's disease. A standardized extract of Centella asiatica ECa233 has been previously reported to have pharmacological effects in the central nervous system.This study aimed to determine the neuroprotective effect and mechanisms of ECa233 in rotenone-induced parkinsonism rats.Rats were orally given either vehicle or ECa233 (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg) for 20 consecutive days. Rotenone (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) was given to parkinsonism (PD) and ECa-treated rats from day 15 to 20. Locomotor activity was recorded on day 1, 14, 17 and 20. -hydroxylase (TH) immunohistological staining was used to determine dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum. Furthermore, mitochondrial complex I activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase protein expression were measured in brain tissue.Rats receiving ECa233 30 mg/kg showed a significant increase in distances (p < 0.01) together with a higher number and intensity of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum (p < 0.001) compared to PD rats. ECa233 (30 mg/kg) protected against mitochondrial complex I inhibition, decreased MDA levels (p < 0.05) and increased SOD (p < 0.01) and catalase (p < 0.05) expression.ECa233 can protect against rotenone-induced motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal death. These effects are mediated through the protection of mitochondrial complex I activity, the effects of antioxidants and the enhancement of antioxidant enzyme expression.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Recent studies using in vitro cell culture models have reported CPF exposure to have a positive association with -mediated oxidative stress response and dopaminergic cell death; however, the mechanism by which mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to dopaminergic cell death remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that STAT1, a transcription factor, causes apoptotic dopaminergic cell death via -mediated oxidative stress mechanisms. Here we show that exposure of dopaminergic neuronal cells such as N27 cells (immortalized murine mesencephalic dopaminergic cells) to CPF resulted in a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic cell death as measured by MTS assay and DNA fragmentation. Similar effects were observed in CPF-treated human dopaminergic neuronal cells (LUHMES cells), with an associated increase in mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, CPF (10 μM) induced time-dependent increase in STAT1 activation coincided with the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, increase in ROS generation, proteolytic cleavage of protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), inhibition of the mitochondrial basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), with a concomitant reduction in ATP-linked OCR and reserve capacity, increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and enhancement of autophagy. Additionally, by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we demonstrated that STAT1 bound to a putative regulatory sequence in the NOX1 and Bax promoter regions in response to CPF in N27 cells. Interestingly, overexpression of non-phosphorylatable STAT1 mutants (STAT1Y701F and STAT1S727A) but not STAT1 WT construct attenuated the cleavage of PKCδ and ultimately cell death in CPF-treated cells. Furthermore, small interfering RNA knockdown demonstrated STAT1 to be a critical regulator of autophagy and -mediated proapoptotic cell signaling events after CPF treatment in N27 cells. Finally, oral administration of CPF (5 mg/kg) in postnatal rats (PNDs 27-61) induced motor deficits, and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration with a concomitant induction of STAT1-dependent proapoptotic cell signaling events. Conversely, co-treatment with mitoapocynin (a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant) and CPF rescued motor deficits, and restored dopaminergic neuronal survival via abrogation of STAT1-dependent proapoptotic cell signaling events. Taken together, our study identifies a novel mechanism by which STAT1 regulates -mediated oxidative stress response, PKCδ activation and autophagy. In this context, the phosphorylation of  701 and Serine 727 in STAT1 was found to be essential for PKCδ cleavage. By attenuating mitochondrial-derived ROS, mitoapocynin may have therapeutic applications for reversing CPF-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and associated neurobehavioral deficits as well as neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It induces on human neuronal cell cultures a dose dependent toxicity associated with increased reactive oxygen species production. Since glial cells play a key role in assisting neuronal function, here we investigated the effects of increased concentrations of 24S-OHC on a glial cell model (human glioblastoma U-87 MG cells). We determined the content of PGC-1α and TFAM, involved in the biogenesis of , both mitochondrial complexes activity and protein amount, lipid and protein oxidative damage, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) release and both the activities and amount of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and catalase. Low concentration of 24S-OHC increased cellular content of PGC-1α and TFAM and the activities of mitochondrial complexes I and II, with no marked changes in their protein amount. Interestingly, 24S-OHC at lower concentrations reduced while at higher concentration increased lipid and protein oxidative damage. Conversely, the content of nitro- increased only with the highest 24S-OHC concentration. Also, cell HO release was reduced by lower and increased by higher 24S-OHC used concentrations. The cell activity of glutathione peroxidase was reduced by 24S-OHC at higher concentration while that of catalase was reduced by all the assayed concentrations. Further, a dose dependent decrease of both enzymes levels was observed. In conclusion, we demonstrated that 24S-OHC exerts different effects on U-87 MG cells depending on its level. At lower concentrations it stimulates cellular processes critical to maintain redox homeostasis, while at higher dose its effect on the glial cell here used resemble its action on neurons.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

EGFR mutant variants, either transmembrane or translocated to the  and/or the nucleus, often exhibit resistance to EGFR inhibitors. The ability to noninvasively image and quantify EGFR provides novel approaches in the detection, monitoring, and treatment of EGFR-related malignancies. The current study aimed to deliver a new theranostic agent that combines fluorescence imaging properties with EGFR inhibition. This was achieved via conjugation of an in-house-developed ((4-bromophenyl)amino)quinazoline inhibitor of mutant EGFR-TK, selected from a focused aminoquinazoline library, with a [Ru(bipyridine)] fluorophore. A triethyleneglycol-derived diamino linker featuring (+)-ionizable sites was employed to link the two functional moieties, affording two unprecedented Ru conjugates with 1:1 and 2:1 stoichiometry of aminoquinazoline to the Ru complex (mono-quinazoline-Ru-conjugate and bis-quinazoline-Ru-conjugate, respectively). The bis-quinazoline-Ru-conjugate, which retains an essential inhibitory activity, was found by fluorescence imaging to be effectively uptaken by Uppsala 87 malignant glioma (grade IV malignant glioma) cells. The fluorescence imaging study and a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer study indicated a specific subcellular distribution of the conjugate that coincides with that of a -targeted dye, suggesting mitochondrial localization of the conjugate and potential association with -translocated forms of EGFR. Mitochondrial localization was further documented by the specific concentration of the bis-quinazoline-Ru-conjugate in a mitochondrial isolation assay.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29953970>Melatonin Synergizes with Sorafenib to Suppress Pancreatic Cancer via Melatonin Receptor and PDGFR-β/STAT3 Pathway.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignant tumors with poor prognosis. Conventional chemotherapies including gemcitabine have failed owing to weak response and side effects. Hence novel treatment regimens are urgently needed to improve the therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we aimed to assess the anticancer activity of melatonin and sorafenib as a novel therapy against PDAC.We used various apoptosis assay and PDAC xenograft model to assess anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo. We applied phospho-receptor  kinase (RTK) array and phospho- kinase array to explore the mechanism of the combined therapy. Western blotting, proximity ligation assay, and immunoprecipitation assay were also performed for validation.Melatonin synergized with sorafenib to suppress the growth of PDAC both in vitro and in vivo. The effect was due to increased apoptosis rate of PDAC cells that was accompanied by  dysfunction. The enhanced anticancer efficacy by the co-treatment could be explained by blockade of PDGFR-β/STAT3 signaling pathway and melatonin receptor (MT)-mediated STAT3.Melatonin reinforces the anticancer activity of sorafenib by downregulation of PDGFR-β/STAT3 signaling pathway and melatonin receptor (MT)-mediated STAT3.

Apoptosis and macroautophagy/autophagy play critical roles in PD pathogenesis; as such, modulating their balance is a potential treatment strategy. BCL2 (B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2) is a key molecule regulating this balance. Piperlongumine (PLG) is an alkaloid extracted from Piper longum L. that has antiinflammatory and anticancer effects. The present study investigated the protective effects of PLG in rotenone-induced PD cell and mouse models. We found that PLG administration (2 and 4 mg/kg) for 4 wk attenuated motor deficits in mice and prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra induced by oral administration of rotenone (10 mg/kg) for 6 wk. PLG improved cell viability and enhanced mitochondrial function in primary neurons and SK-N-SH cells. These protective effects were exerted via inhibition of apoptosis and induction of autophagy through enhancement of BCL2 phosphorylation at Ser70. These results demonstrate that PLG exerts therapeutic effects in a rotenone-induced PD models by restoring the balance between apoptosis and autophagy.6-OHDA, 6-hydroxydopamine; ACTB, actin, beta; BafA1, bafilomycin A; BAK1, BCL2-antagonist/killer 1; BAX, BCL2-associated X protein; BCL2, B cell leukemia/lymphoma2; BECN1, Beclin 1, autophagy related; CoQ10, coenzyme Q; COX4I1/COX IV, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4I1; CsA, cyclosporine A; ED50, 50% effective dose; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; JC-1, tetraethylbenz-imidazolylcarbocyanine iodide; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain3; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; l-dopa, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine; MAPK8/JNK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 8; MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; mPTP, mitochondrial permeability transition pore; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; MPTP, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; NFE2L2/NRF2, nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2; PD, Parkinson disease; PLG, piperlongumine; pNA, p-nitroanilide; PI, propidium iodide; PtdIns3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PtdIns3P, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; PTX, paclitaxel; Rap, rapamycin; SQSTM1/p62, sequestosome 1; TH,  hydroxylase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling; WIPI2, WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2; ZFYVE1/DFCP1, zinc finger, FYVE domain containing 1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29199635>Melatonin Elicits Stimulatory Action on the Adrenal Gland of Soay Ram: Morphometrical, Immunohistochemical, and Ultrastructural Study.</a></h2><p>Endogenous melatonin is a hormone secreted by pineal gland; it has several roles in metabolism, reproduction, and remarkable antioxidant properties. Studies on the melatonin effect on the adrenal glands which are important endocrine organs, controlling essential physiological functions, are still deficient. In this study, we attempted to investigate the effect of exogenous melatonin treatment on the adrenal cortex and medulla using several approaches. Adrenal glands of 15 Soay ram were examined to detect the effect of melatonin treatment. Our results revealed that the cells of adrenal cortex of the treated animals were separated by wide and numerous blood sinusoids and showed signs of increase steroidogenic activity, which are evidenced by functional hypertrophy with increase profiles of , smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and lipid droplets. The most striking ultrastructural features in the medulla of the treated group were the engorgement of chromaffin cells with enlarged secretory granules enclosed within a significantly increased diameter of these cells. The cytoplasm of these cells showed numerous , rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and glycogen granules. Exocytosis of secretory granules to the lumen of blood vessels was evident in the treated group. Piecemeal degranulation mode of secretion was recorded after melatonin treatment. Chromaffin cells in the control group expressed moderate immunoreactivity to Synaptophysin and  hydroxylase, compared with intensified expression after melatonin treatment. The ganglion cells of the melatonin-treated group showed a significant increase in diameter with numerous rER. The most interesting feature in this study is the presence of small granule chromaffin cells (SGC) and telocytes (TCs) for the first time in the adrenal glands of sheep. Moreover, these SGC cells, Schwann cells, fibroblasts, and progenitor stem cells showed a stimulatory response. The TCs were small branched cells scattered in the adrenal glands around cortical cells, chromaffin cells, nerve fibers, and blood vessels. These cells increased significantly in number, length of their telopodes, and secretory activity after melatonin treatment. In addition, multiple profiles of unmyelinated nerve fibers were demonstrated in all treated specimens. These results indicated that melatonin treatment caused a stimulatory action on all cellular and neuronal elements of the adrenal gland.

In order to reveal the mechanism of these processes we studied the effects of peroxynitrite on isolated beef heart  in vitro. Peroxynitrite has the potential to nitrate protein  moieties, break the peptide bond, and eventually release the membrane proteins into the solution. All these effects were found in our experiments. Mitochondrial proteins were resolved by 2D electrophoresis and the protein nitration was detected by immunochemical methods and by nano LC-MS/MS. Mass spectrometry confirmed nitration of ATP synthase subunit beta, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta, citrate synthase and acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase. Immunoblot detection using chemiluminiscence showed possible nitration of other proteins such as cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 1, NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 2, elongation factor Tu, NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein 2, heat shock protein beta-1 and NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 8.

As a product of water chlorination and a metabolite of certain industrial chemicals, DCA is ubiquitous in our biosphere at low μg/kg body weight daily exposure levels without obvious adverse effects in humans. As an investigational drug for numerous congenital and acquired diseases, DCA is administered orally or parenterally, usually at doses of 10-50mg/kg per day. As a therapeutic, its principal mechanism of action is to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). In turn, PDK inhibits the key mitochondrial energy homeostat, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), by reversible phosphorylation. By blocking PDK, DCA activates PDC and, consequently, the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP synthesis. A reversible sensory/motor peripheral neuropathy is the clinically limiting adverse effect of chronic DCA exposure and experimental data implicate the Schwann cell as a toxicological target. It has been postulated that stimulation of PDC and respiratory chain activity by DCA in normally glycolytic Schwann cells causes uncompensated oxidative stress from increased reactive oxygen species production. Additionally, the metabolism of DCA interferes with the catabolism of the amino acids phenylalanine and  and with heme synthesis, resulting in accumulation of reactive molecules capable of forming adducts with DNA and proteins and also resulting in oxidative stress. Preliminary evidence in rodent models of peripheral neuropathy suggest that DCA-induced neurotoxicity may be mitigated by naturally occurring antioxidants and by a specific class of muscarinic receptor antagonists. These findings generate a number of testable hypotheses regarding the etiology and treatment of DCA peripheral neuropathy.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The induction of cell death programs was investigated in two brain regions, cortex (Cx) and substantia nigra (SN), after the exposure period. We found that DMT increased cytochrome C (CytC) release from , the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the activity of caspase-3 and calpains, in both brain regions compared to VEH injected ones. DMT treatment induced oxidative damage of lipids with a consequent enrichment in saturated over unsaturated fatty acids. However, the activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes was not affected by DMT treatment. The activation of the pro-apoptotic pathway can be correlated with a decrease of TH-immunoreactive neurons in SN, comparable to the reduction observed in this cell population by aging. The results of this work contribute to understand the toxic mechanism of DMT and the possible etiological role that residues of this insecticide, might play in neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report the structural features and functional behavior of a phosphomimetic cytochrome  mutant, which was generated by site-specific incorporation at position 97 of -carboxymethyl-l-phenylalanine using the evolved tRNA synthetase method. We found that the point mutation does not alter the overall folding and heme environment of cytochrome , but significantly affects the entire oxidative phosphorylation process. In fact, the electron donation rate of the mutant heme protein to cytochrome  oxidase, or complex IV, within respiratory supercomplexes was higher than that of the wild-type species, in agreement with the observed decrease in reactive oxygen species production. Direct contact of cytochrome  with the respiratory supercomplex factor HIGD1A (hypoxia-inducible domain family member 1A) is reported here, with the mutant heme protein exhibiting a lower affinity than the wild-type species. Interestingly, phosphomimetic cytochrome  also exhibited a lower caspase-3 activation activity. Altogether, these findings yield a better understanding of the molecular basis for mitochondrial metabolism in acute diseases, such as brain ischemia, and thus could allow the use of phosphomimetic cytochrome  as a neuroprotector with therapeutic applications.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

However, the pathogenic mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the levels of  3‑monooxygenase/tryptophan 5‑monooxygenase activation protein β (YWHAB; also known as 14‑3‑3β), in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) treated with different concentrations of oleic acid (OA) were examined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. The migration of VSMCs was examined using wound‑healing and Transwell migration assays. The protein distribution of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (BCL‑2)‑associated death promoter (BAD) in VSMCs treated with OA was examined by immunofluorescence and western blot analyses. In in vivo experiments, the carotid artery morphology of rats in different groups was assessed at 14 days post‑injury by non-invasive ultrasonographic imaging and confirmed by histological staining. The expression of YWHAB was upregulated by OA in a concentration‑dependent manner in VSMCs. In the in vivo experiments, carotid stenosis was more serious among high‑FFA diabetic rats. However, silencing of YWHAB significantly alleviated carotid neointimal hyperplasia among the diabetic rats with elevated FFA levels. In addition, YWHAB silencing alleviated the migration of OA‑treated VSMCs and increased translocation of the BAD protein from the cytoplasm to the . In conclusion, the results showed that FFA‑induced upregulation of YWHAB was involved in neointimal hyperplasia by enhancing the migration of VSMCs following carotid artery injury. The inhibition of YWHAB may serve as a novel potential pharmacological target for preventing vascular restenosis following interventional therapy in diabetic individuals with high FFA levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537467>A new human pyridinium metabolite of furosemide, inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, is a candidate inducer of neurodegeneration.</a></h2><p>Pharmaceuticals and their by-products are increasingly a matter of concern, because of their unknown impacts on human health and ecosystems.

In our previous papers, we found that CytC and CL mixed in millimolar concentrations form a sediment showing microcrystals composed of nanospheres (Cyt-CL) of 11-12 and 8 nm in diameter. The hypothesis was proposed that Cyt-CL, having hydrophobic shell, may appear inside the membrane lipid bilayer in  and peroxidase membrane phospholipids so initiating the apoptotic cascade. In this work, Cyt-CL complex dissolved in chloroform or hexane was investigated as a model of the complex in mitochondrial membranes. We used dynamic light scattering method to measure the size of the particles. The analysis of particles size distribution of Cyt-CL in chloroform allows to reveal three dominant diameters of 12.1 ± 1.4, 7.8 ± 1.0, and 4.7 ± 0.7 nm. The first two values are closed to those, earlier obtained with small-angle X-ray scattering method in Cyt-CL microcrystals, 11.1 ± 1.0 and 8.0 ± 0.7 nm. CL extracted in chloroform-methanol forms a real solution of particles with diameter of 0.7 ± 0.1 nm.

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of cardiomyocyte Spry1 in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Infarct areas of mouse hearts showed an increase in Spry1 protein expression, which localized to cardiomyocytes. To investigate if cardiomyocyte Spry1 regulates I/R injury, 8-week-old inducible cardiomyocyte Spry1 knockout (Spry1 cKO) mice and control mice were subjected to cardiac I/R injury. Spry1 cKO mice showed reduction in release of cardiac troponin I and reduced infarct size after I/R injury compared to control mice. Similar to Spry1 knockdown in cardiomyocytes in vivo, RNAi-mediated Spry1 silencing in isolated cardiomyocytes improved cardiomyocyte survival following simulated ischemia injury. Mechanistically, Spry1 knockdown induced cardiomyocyte extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in healthy hearts and isolated cardiomyocytes, and enhanced ERK phosphorylation after I/R injury. Spry1-deficient cardiomyocytes showed better preserved mitochondrial membrane potential following ischemic injury and an increase in levels of phosphorylated ERK and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in  of hypoxic cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of constitutively active GSK-3β abrogated the protective effect of Spry1 knockdown. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3β protected wild-type cardiomyocytes from cell death, but did not further protect Spry1-silenced cardiomyocytes from hypoxia-induced injury.

A few probes have been innovated to measure intracellular O or ONOO by fluorescent imaging separately, but revealing the definite link of O, ONOO and arginase 1 in situ remains unidentified in hepatic IR. Thus, a well-designed dual-color two-photon fluorescence probe (CyCA) was created for the in situ real-time detection of O-ONOO. Surprisingly, CyCA exhibited a suitable combination of high specificity, preeminent sensitivity, exclusive -targeting and fast-response. On the basis of remarkable advantages, we successfully applied CyCA to visualize endogenous O and ONOO in living cells and mice. The synergistic elevation of mitochondrial O-ONOO in IR mice was observed for the first time. Furthermore, three  nitration-sites in arginase 1 caused by ONOO were identified in proteomic analysis, which was never reported previously. Attractively, nitro-modified arginase 1 could further promote ONOO formation, ultimately exacerbating the intracellular redox imbalance and IR injury. These new findings decipher direct molecular links of O-ONOO-arginase 1, and suggest effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of IR injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Even though many etiological factors were reported, the specific mechanism of GR is yet to be elucidated. Given the species richness concerning marine biodiversity, it could be a treasure trove for drug discovery. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of a marine compound, (+)-rhodoptilometrin from crinoid, on gingival cell migration, wound healing, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Experimental results showed that (+)-rhodoptilometrin can significantly increase wound healing, migration, and proliferation of human gingival fibroblast cells, and it does not have effects on oral mucosa fibroblast cells. In addition, (+)-rhodoptilometrin increases the gene and protein expression levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), fibronectin, and type I collagen, changes the intracellular distribution of FAK and F-actin, and increases OXPHOS and the expression levels of complexes I~V in the . Based on our results, we believe that (+)-rhodoptilometrin might increase FAK expression and promote mitochondrial function to affect cell migration and promote gingival regeneration. Therefore, (+)-rhodoptilometrin may be a promising therapeutic agent for GR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311833>Inhibiting crosstalk between MET signaling and mitochondrial dynamics and morphology: a novel therapeutic approach for lung cancer and mesothelioma.</a></h2><p>The receptor  kinase MET is frequently involved in malignant transformation and inhibiting its activity in MET-dependent cancers is associated with improved clinical outcomes. Emerging evidence also suggests that  play an essential role in tumorigenesis and Dynamin Related Protein (DRP1), a key component of the mitochondrial fission machinery, has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target. Here, we report that inhibiting MET activity with the  kinase inhibitor MGCD516 attenuates viability, migration, and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cell lines , and significantly retards tumor growth . Interestingly, MGCD516 treatment also results in altered mitochondrial morphology in these cell lines. Furthermore, inhibiting MET pharmacologically or knocking down its expression using siRNA, decreases DRP1 activity alluding to possible crosstalk between them in these two cancers. Consistently, a combination of MGCD516 and mdivi-1, a quinazolinone reported to inhibit mitochondrial fission, is more effective in attenuating proliferation of NSCLC and MPM cell lines than either drug alone. Considered together, the present study has uncovered a novel mechanism underlying mitochondrial regulation by MET that involves crosstalk with DRP1, and suggests that a combination therapy targeting both MET and DRP1 could be a novel strategy for NSCLC and MPM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804742>The  Mouse - A Valuable Resource in Anorexia Nervosa Research.</a></h2><p>Animal models are invaluable resources in research concerning the neurobiology of anorexia nervosa (AN), to a large extent since valid clinical samples are rare. None of the existing models can capture all aspects of AN but they are able to mirror the core features of the disorder e.g., elective starvation, emaciation and premature death. The anorectic  mouse is of particular value for the understanding of the abnormal response to negative energy balance seen in AN. These mice appear normal at birth but gradually develops starvation and emaciation despite full access to food, and die prematurely around three weeks of age. Several changes in hypothalamic neuropeptidergic and -transmitter systems involved in regulating food intake and metabolism have been documented in the  mouse. These changes are accompanied by signs of inflammation and degeneration in the same hypothalamic regions; including activation of microglia cells and expression of major histocompatibility complex I by microglia and selective neuronal populations. These aberrances are likely related to the dysfunction of complex I (CI) in the oxidative phosphorylation system of the , and subsequent increased oxidative stress, which also has been revealed in the hypothalamus of these mice. Interestingly, a similar CI dysfunction has been shown in leukocytes from patients with AN. In addition, a higher expression of the  gene has been shown in the  hypothalamus. This agrees with AN being associated with specific variants of the genes for brain derived neurotrophic factor and Neurotrophic Receptor  Kinase 2. The  mouse is also glucose intolerant and display pancreatic dysfunction related to increased levels of circulating free fatty acids (FFA) and pancreatic inflammation. An increased incidence of eating disorders has been reported for young diabetic women, and as well has increased levels of circulating FFAs in AN. Also similar to individuals with AN, the  mouse has reduced leptin and increased cholesterol levels in serum. Thus, the  mouse shares several characteristics with patients with AN, including emaciation, starvation, premature death, diabetic features, increased FFA and low leptin, and is therefore a unique resource in research on the (neuro)biology of AN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294126>The potential role of mitochondrial impairment in the pathogenesis of imatinib-induced renal injury.</a></h2><p>Imatinib is a  kinase inhibitor widely administered against chronic myeloid leukemia. On the other hand, drug-induced kidney proximal tubular injury, electrolytes disturbances, and renal failure is a clinical complication associated with imatinib therapy. There is no precise cellular mechanism(s) for imatinib-induced renal injury. The current investigation aimed to evaluate the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of imatinib nephrotoxicity. Rats received imatinib (50 and 100 mg/kg, oral, 14 consecutive days). Serum and urine biomarkers of renal injury and markers of oxidative stress in the kidney tissue were assessed. Moreover, kidney  were isolated, and mitochondrial indices, including mitochondrial depolarization, dehydrogenases activity, mitochondrial permeabilization, lipid peroxidation (LPO), mitochondrial glutathione levels, and ATP content were determined. A significant increase in serum (Creatinine; Cr and blood urea nitrogen; BUN) and urine (Glucose, protein, gamma-glutamyl transferase; γ-GT, and alkaline phosphatase; ALP) biomarkers of renal injury, as well as serum electrolytes disturbances (hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia), were evident in imatinib-treated animals. On the other hand, imatinib (100 mg/kg) caused an increase in kidney ROS and LPO. Renal tubular interstitial nephritis, tissue necrosis, and atrophy were evident as tissue histopathological changes in imatinib-treated rats. Mitochondrial parameters were also adversely affected by imatinib administration. These data represent mitochondrial impairment, renal tissue energy crisis, and oxidative stress as possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of imatinib-induced renal injury and serum electrolytes disturbances.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30031347>Fluazinam impairs oxidative phosphorylation and induces hyper/hypo-activity in a dose specific manner in zebrafish larvae.</a></h2><p>Fluazinam is a pyridinamine fungicide that induces oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in cells, and it has been reported to be neurotoxic. To characterize the biological effects of fluazinam, we assessed mitochondrial bioenergetics, dopamine system expression, and behavior of early life staged zebrafish (0.01 μM-0.5 μM). Fluazinam at environmentally-relevant levels did not induce sub-lethal effects in larvae, but at the LC (0.5 μM), fluazinam decreased basal and ATP-linked respiration significantly in embryos. As  are directly related to redox homeostasis and apoptosis, the expression of genes related to oxidative stress and apoptosis were measured. Superoxide dismutase 2 (sod2), heat stock protein 70 (hsp70), bcl2-associated X protein (bax), and caspase 9 (casp9) mRNA levels were up-regulated by 0.5 μM fluazinam. Taken together, there was evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage at the highest concentration of fluazinam (0.5 μM) tested. As there are reports for fluazinam-induced neurotoxicity in dopamine synthesizing cells, transcriptional targets in the dopamine system were assessed in the zebrafish.  hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine receptor 2a (drd2a) mRNA levels were decreased by 0.5 μM fluazinam, suggesting that this fungicide may affect the dopaminergic system. To further assess the potential for fluazinam-mediated neuromodulation, the dark photokinesis response was assessed in larvae following exposure. Larvae exposed to 0.1 μM fluazinam showed hyperactivity, while larvae exposed to 0.2 and 0.3 μM showed hypo-activity. This study demonstrates that fluazinam disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics in zebrafish, inducing an oxidative stress response, and aberrant behaviors in larvae that are dose dependent.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These enzymes are essential in the metabolic pathways to degrade aromatic compounds in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It appears that prokaryotic FAH superfamily members evolved mainly to allow microbes to generate energy and useful metabolites from complex carbon sources. We review recent findings, indicating that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic members of the FAH superfamily also display oxaloacetate decarboxylase (ODx) activity. The identification of human FAH domain-containing protein 1 as mitochondrial ODx regulating mitochondrial function supports the new concept that, during evolution, eukaryotic FAH superfamily members have acquired important regulatory functions beyond catabolism of complex carbon sources. Molecular studies on the evolution and function of FAH superfamily members are expected to provide new mechanistic insights in their physiological roles.© 2018 The Author(s).

Pathogenicity is itself a complicated trait underpinned by multiple complex traits, such as thermotolerance, morphology, and stress response. The baker's yeast, , is a species with broad environmental tolerance that has been increasingly reported as an opportunistic pathogen of humans. Here we leveraged the genetic resources available in yeast and a model insect species, the greater waxmoth , to provide a genome-wide analysis of pathogenicity factors. Using serial passaging experiments of genetically marked wild-type strains, a hybrid strain was identified as the most fit genotype across all replicates. To dissect the genetic basis for pathogenicity in the hybrid isolate, bulk segregant analysis was performed which revealed eight quantitative trait loci significantly differing between the two bulks with alleles from both parents contributing to pathogenicity. A second passaging experiment with a library of deletion mutants for most yeast genes identified a large number of mutations whose relative fitness differed , including mutations in genes controlling cell wall integrity, mitochondrial function, and  metabolism. Yeast is presumably subjected to a massive assault by the innate insect immune system that leads to melanization of the host and to a large bottleneck in yeast population size. Our data support that resistance to the innate immune response of the insect is key to survival in the host and identifies shared genetic mechanisms between  and other opportunistic fungal pathogens.Copyright © 2018 Phadke et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29070697>Overcoming mutational complexity in acute myeloid leukemia by inhibition of critical pathways.</a></h2><p>Numerous variant alleles are associated with human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the same variants are also found in individuals with no hematological disease, making their functional relevance obscure. Through NOD.Cg-/ (NSG) xenotransplantation, we functionally identified preleukemic and leukemic stem cell populations present in FMS-like  kinase 3 internal tandem duplication-positive (-ITD) AML patient samples. By single-cell DNA sequencing, we identified clonal structures and linked mutations with in vivo fates, distinguishing mutations permissive of nonmalignant multilineage hematopoiesis from leukemogenic mutations. Although multiple somatic mutations coexisted at the single-cell level, inhibition of the mutation strongly associated with preleukemic to leukemic stem cell transition eliminated AML in vivo. Moreover, concurrent inhibition of BCL-2 (B cell lymphoma 2) uncovered a critical dependence of resistant AML cells on antiapoptotic pathways. Co-inhibition of pathways critical for oncogenesis and survival may be an effective strategy that overcomes genetic diversity in human malignancies. This approach incorporating single-cell genomics with the NSG patient-derived xenograft model may serve as a broadly applicable resource for precision target identification and drug discovery.Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

While LPT is one of the dual  kinase inhibitors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human EGFR2 (HER2), TNBC cells often exhibit EGFR positive and HER2 negative patterns. Along with the HER2-independent anticancer activities of LPT in TNBC, apoptosis-inducing properties of TPP and TS (resulting from mitochondrial targeting and destabilization) were introduced to amplify the anticancer activities of HA-TS-TPP/LPT NPs for TNBC. HA-TS-TPP/LPT NPs, with approximately 207 nm mean diameter, unimodal size distribution, spherical shape, negative zeta potential, and sufficient particle stability, were prepared in this study. The improved antiproliferation potential, apoptotic efficacy, and mitochondrial destabilizing activity of HA-TS-TPP/LPT NPs, compared with HA-TS/LPT NPs, were demonstrated in TNBC (i.e., MDA-MB-231) cells. The in vivo tumor targeting capability of HA-TS-TPP/LPT NPs was proven in MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mouse models using real-time optical imaging. Of note, HA-TS-TPP/LPT NPs exhibited a better tumor growth suppression profile than the other groups after intravenous injection. It is expected that developed HA-TS-TPP NPs can elevate the therapeutic potential of LPT for TNBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29847337>Neuroprotective effects of Danshensu in Parkinson's disease mouse model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) causes major changes in dopaminergic neurons of the brain, resulting in motor symptoms in older adults. A previous study showed that Danshensu alleviates the cognitive decline by attenuating neuroinflammation. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of Danshensu in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into the following four groups: control, MPTP, Danshensu at 15 mg/kg, and Danshensu at 60 mg/kg. The mice were administered Danshensu intragastrically for 14 days. In the behavioral tests, Danshensu treatment alleviated motor dysfunction induced by MPTP. The number of  hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra was significantly reduced in the MPTP group, relative to the control group; Danshensu partially blocked this reduction in  hydroxylase-positive neurons. In addition, Danshensu attenuated the reductions in striatal dopamine and 5-HT levels induced by MPTP. Danshensu also diminished the increase in Iba1-positive cells in the substantia nigra and reduced the levels of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in the striatum. These findings suggest that Danshensu exerts neuroprotective effects and improves motor function in PD mice, at least in part, by reducing neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30076580>Inhibition of glutathione S-transferase-pi triggers c-jun N-terminal kinase-dependent neuronal death in Zn-induced Parkinsonism.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress is recognized as one of the major wrongdoers in Parkinson's disease (PD) while glutathione S-transferase (GST), an endogenous antioxidant, protects from oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration. Despite GST-pi (GST-π) encounters the toxic manifestations in PD, its role in zinc (Zn)-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration remains elusive. The study aimed to explore the role of GST-π in Zn-induced Parkinsonism and its underlying molecular mechanism. Male Wistar rats were treated intraperitoneally with zinc (zinc sulfate), twice a week, for 2-12 weeks. GST-π inducer, benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) was also administered in a few sets of experiments along with respective vehicle. Catalytic activity and expression of GST-π protein, total GST activity, neurobehavioral indexes, striatal dopamine and its metabolites, nigral  hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons and expression of TH and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) proteins were reduced in Zn-treated rats. Conversely, oxidative stress indicators, c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, c-jun phosphorylation, cytochrome c release, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) translocation, and procaspase 3/9 to caspase 3/9 conversion were significantly increased in Zn-exposed rats. BITC ameliorated GST-π activity/expression and normalized Zn-induced changes in neurodegenerative indicators, oxidative stress, JNK activation, c-jun phosphorylation and apoptotic indexes. The results demonstrate that Zn inhibits GST-π expression leading to increased oxidative stress and JNK activation, which induce apoptosis thereby degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659149>Tunneling nanotube-mediated intercellular vesicle and protein transfer in the stroma-provided imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia cells.</a></h2><p>Intercellular communication within the bone marrow niche significantly promotes leukemogenesis and provides protection of leukemic cells from therapy. Secreted factors, intercellular transfer of  and the receptor-ligand interactions have been shown as mediators of this protection. Here we report that tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-long, thin membranous structures, which have been identified as a novel mode of intercellular cross-talk-are formed in the presence of stroma and mediate transfer of cellular vesicles from stroma to leukemic cells. Importantly, transmission of vesicles via TNTs from stromal cells increases resistance of leukemic cells to the  kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Using correlative light-electron microscopy and electron tomography we show that stromal TNTs contain vesicles, provide membrane continuity with the cell bodies and can be open-ended. Moreover, trans-SILAC studies to reveal the non-autonomous proteome showed that specific sets of proteins are transferred together with cellular vesicles from stromal to leukemic cells, with a potential role in survival and adaptation. Altogether, our findings provide evidence for the biological role of the TNT-mediated vesicle exchange between stromal and leukemic cells, implicating the direct vesicle and protein transfer in the stroma-provided protection of leukemic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29072336>Mechanisms of toxicity associated with six  kinase inhibitors in human hepatocyte cell lines.</a></h2><p> kinase inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of certain cancers. They are usually well tolerated, but can cause adverse reactions including liver injury. Currently, mechanisms of hepatotoxicity associated with  kinase inhibitors are only partially clarified. We therefore aimed at investigating the toxicity of regorafenib, sorafenib, ponatinib, crizotinib, dasatinib and pazopanib on HepG2 and partially on HepaRG cells. Regorafenib and sorafenib strongly inhibited oxidative metabolism (measured by the Seahorse-XF24 analyzer) and glycolysis, decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced apoptosis and/or necrosis of HepG2 cells at concentrations similar to steady-state plasma concentrations in humans. In HepaRG cells, pretreatment with rifampicin decreased membrane toxicity (measured as adenylate kinase release) and dissipation of adenosine triphosphate stores, indicating that toxicity was associated mainly with the parent drugs. Ponatinib strongly impaired oxidative metabolism but only weakly glycolysis, and induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells at concentrations higher than steady-state plasma concentrations in humans. Crizotinib and dasatinib did not significantly affect mitochondrial functions and inhibited glycolysis only weakly, but induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Pazopanib was associated with a weak increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation and inhibition of glycolysis without being cytotoxic. In conclusion, regorafenib and sorafenib are strong mitochondrial toxicants and inhibitors of glycolysis at clinically relevant concentrations. Ponatinib affects  and glycolysis at higher concentrations than reached in plasma (but possibly in liver), whereas crizotinib, dasatinib and pazopanib showed no relevant toxicity. Mitochondrial toxicity and inhibition of glycolysis most likely explain hepatotoxicity associated with regorafenib, sorafenib and possibly pazopanib, but not for the other compounds investigated.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894019>Neuron-targeted caveolin-1 improves neuromuscular function and extends survival in SOD1 mice.</a></h2><p>Interventions that preserve motor neurons or restore functional motor neuroplasticity may extend longevity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Delivery of neurotrophins may potentially revive degenerating motor neurons, yet this approach is dependent on the proper subcellular localization of neurotrophin receptor (NTR) to plasmalemmal signaling microdomains, termed membrane/lipid rafts (MLRs). We previously showed that overexpression of synapsin-driven caveolin-1 (Cav-1) () increases MLR localization of NTR [, receptor  kinase B (TrkB)], promotes hippocampal synaptic and neuroplasticity, and significantly improves learning and memory in aged mice. The present study crossed a SynCav1 transgene-positive (SynCav1) mouse with the mutant human superoxide dismutase glycine to alanine point mutation at amino acid 93 (hSOD1) mouse model of ALS. When compared with hSOD1, hSOD1/SynCav1 mice exhibited greater body weight and longer survival as well as better motor function. Microscopic analyses of hSOD1/SynCav1 spinal cords revealed preserved spinal cord α-motor neurons and preserved mitochondrial morphology. Moreover, hSOD1/SynCav1 spinal cords contained more MLRs (cholera toxin subunit B positive) and MLR-associated TrkB and Cav-1 protein expression.

To investigate the influence of inhibition of inflammatory pathways on the biogenic amine neurotransmitters metabolism in depressive rats, sertraline, and meloxicam, the inhibitors of arachidonic acid - cyclooxygenase-2/lipoxygenase (AA-COX-2/5-LO) pathways, were given to depressive rats. After the development of depression model by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 6 weeks, Successful modeling rats were selected and randomly divided into CUMS group and medication administration group. After given medicine, The biogenic amine neurotransmitters in rat cortex and hippocampus were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with an electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD). Compared with the normal group, the concentration of norepinephrine (NE) significantly decreased and the concentrations of  (Tyr), Tryptophan (Trp), 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) significantly increased in the CUMS group. Sertraline significantly inhibited the elevation of 5-HIAA. Meloxicam inhibited the decrease of NE level in CUMS-induced rat and the increase of Trp, MHPG, and 5-HIAA level in a dose-dependent manner. Caffeic acid inhibited the decrease of NE and the increase of Trp and MHPG in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of AA-COX-2/5-LO pathways can improve the behaviors of depression rats and suppress CUMS-induced changes in biogenic amines.

This study aimed to explore a novel mechanism responsible for diabetic cardiomyopathy development, and also validated whether melatonin played a protective role in repairing damaged heart in the diabetes setting. Our data demonstrated that spleen  kinase (Syk) was activated by chronic high-glucose stimulus and contributed to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, genetic ablation of Syk or supplementation of melatonin to inhibit Syk activation improved diabetic myocardial function, reduced cardiac fibrosis and preserved cardiomyocytes viability. Mechanistically, activated Syk repressed the expression and activity of mitochondrial complex I (COX-1), unfortunately evoking mitochondrial and/or cellular ROS overproduction. Subsequently, excessive superoxide facilitated SERCA peroxidation which failed to re-uptake the cytoplasmic calcium back into endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to cellular calcium overload. Finally, activated oxidative stress and calcium overload collectively promoted the high-glucose-induced cardiomyocytes death via caspase-9-related mitochondrial apoptosis and caspase-12-involved ER apoptosis, respectively. Interestingly, inhibition of Syk via Syk genetic ablation or melatonin administration blocked Syk/COX-1/SERCA signalling pathways, and thus abolished mitochondrial- and ER-mediated cardiomyocyte death in the setting of diabetes. Based on these results, we suggest a novel pathway by which high-glucose stimulus induces diabetic cardiomyopathy is possibly through an activation of Syk/COX-1/SERCA axis which could be abrogated by melatonin treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The single-copy tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Tb-TyrRS) of T. brucei has an unusual structure and forms a pseudo-dimer. It is therefore twice the size than tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases of most other organisms. Here we show by inducible RNAi that Tb-TyrRS is essential for normal growth of procyclic T. brucei. Furthermore we demonstrate that Tb-TyrRS aminoacylates cytosolic as well as mitochondrial tRNA indicating that it is dually localized. Finally we show that individual deletion of the 36 N- or C-terminal amino acids abolishes the function of Tb-TyrRS. This indicates that both monomeric units of the enzyme, the C-terminal one of which is predicted to lack enzymatic activity, are essential for Tb-TyrRS function.

While at low concentrations mitochondrial peroxynitrite has been associated with redox signaling actions, increased levels can disrupt mitochondrial homeostasis and lead to pathology. Peroxiredoxin 3 is exclusively located in , where it has been previously shown to play a major role in hydrogen peroxide reduction. In turn, reduction of peroxynitrite by peroxiredoxin 3 has been inferred from its protective actions against  nitration and neurotoxicity in animal models, but was not experimentally addressed so far. Herein, we demonstrate the human peroxiredoxin 3 reduces peroxynitrite with a rate constant of 1 × 10 M s at pH 7.8 and 25 °C. Reaction with hydroperoxides caused biphasic changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of peroxiredoxin 3: the first phase corresponded to the peroxidatic cysteine oxidation to sulfenic acid. Peroxynitrite in excess led to peroxiredoxin 3 hyperoxidation and  nitration, oxidative post-translational modifications that had been previously identified in vivo. A significant fraction of the oxidant is expected to react with CO and generate secondary radicals, which participate in further oxidation and nitration reactions, particularly under metabolic conditions of active oxidative decarboxylations or increased hydroperoxide formation.

Peroxynitrite (ONOO), a representative reactive nitrogen species, mediates excessive mitophagy activation and exacerbates cerebral I/R injury. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that naringin, a natural antioxidant, could inhibit ONOO-mediated mitophagy activation and attenuate cerebral I/R injury. Firstly, we demonstrated that naringin possessed strong ONOO scavenging capability and also inhibited the production of superoxide and nitric oxide in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 10 h oxygen-glucose-deprivation plus 14 h of reoxygenation or ONOO donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine conditions. Naringin also inhibited the expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and iNOS in rat brains subjected to 2 h ischemia plus 22 h reperfusion. Next, we found that naringin was able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and naringin decreased neurological deficit score, reduced infarct size, and attenuated apoptotic cell death in the ischemia-reperfused rat brains. Furthermore, naringin reduced 3-nitrotyrosine formation, decreased the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I in mitochondrial fraction, and inhibited the translocation of Parkin to the .

Depletion of Mitofusin (dMfn) or Opa1 led to dysfunctional , activation of Target of rapamycin (TOR) and a marked accumulation of lipid droplets. Enhancement of lipid utilization by the  attenuated TOR activation and rescued the loss of GSCs that was caused by inhibition of mitochondrial fusion. Moreover, constitutive activation of the TOR-pathway target and lipogenesis factor Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) also resulted in GSC loss, whereas inhibition of SREBP rescued GSC loss triggered by depletion of dMfn. Our findings highlight a critical role for mitochondrial fusion and lipid homeostasis in GSC maintenance, providing insight into the potential impact of mitochondrial and metabolic diseases on the function of stem and/or germ cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109251>Metabolic control of regulatory T cell (Treg) survival and function by Lkb1.</a></h2><p>The metabolic programs of functionally distinct T cell subsets are tailored to their immunologic activities. While quiescent T cells use oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy production, and effector T cells (Teffs) rely on glycolysis for proliferation, the distinct metabolic features of regulatory T cells (Tregs) are less well established. Here we show that the metabolic sensor LKB1 is critical to maintain cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis in Tregs. Treg-specific deletion of  in mice causes loss of Treg number and function, leading to a fatal, early-onset autoimmune disorder. Tregs lacking  have defective , compromised OXPHOS, depleted cellular ATP, and altered cellular metabolism pathways that compromise their survival and function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the function of LKB1 in Tregs is largely independent of the AMP-activated protein kinase, but is mediated by the MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinases and salt-inducible kinases. Our results define a metabolic checkpoint in Tregs that couples metabolic regulation to immune homeostasis and tolerance.Copyright © 2017 the Author(s).

Beginning at 3 months of age, male C57BL/6 mice received oral TCE dissolved in vehicle for 8 months. Dopaminergic neuronal loss was assessed by nigral  hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity. Selective dopaminergic neurodegeneration was determined based on histological analysis of non-dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Behavioral assays were evaluated using open field activity and rotarod tests. Mitochondrial complex I activity, oxidative stress markers, and microglial activation were also examined in the substantia nigra. The level of TaClo was detected using HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Dopaminergic neurotoxicity of TaClo was determined in midbrain organotypic cultures from rat pups. Following 8 months of TCE treatment, there was a progressive and selective loss of 50% of the dopaminergic neurons in mouse substantia nigra (SN) and about 50% loss of dopamine and 72% loss of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the striatum, respectively. In addition, motor deficits, mitochondrial impairment, oxidative stress, and inflammation were measured. TaClo content was quantified in the brain after TCE treatment. In organotypic cultures, TaClo rather than TCE induced dopaminergic neuronal loss, similar to MPP. TCE exposure may stimulate the endogenous formation of TaClo, which is responsible for dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, even prolonged administration of TCE was insufficient for producing a greater than 50% loss of nigral dopamine neurons, indicating that additional co-morbid factors would be needed for mimicking the profound loss of dopamine neurons seen in Parkinson's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29783643>Hydroxysafflor Yellow A Attenuates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Neurotoxicity and Neuroinflammation in Primary Mesencephalic Cultures.</a></h2><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation triggers and accelerates the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).  L., a traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely used for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease. Hydroxysafflor Yellow A (HSYA) is an active component of . The purpose of this study was to investigate whether HSYA could attenuate LPS-induced neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation in primary mesencephalic cultures. Cell viability was measured by MTT and LDH assays. The number of  hydroxylase (TH) positive neuron was observed by immunohistochemistry. NF-κB p65 and iNOS expressions were evaluated with western blotting method. Pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and TNF-α were determined by ELISA kits. Nitric oxide (NO) content in the culture medium was assayed. The results showed that HSYA treatment significantly attenuated the LPS-induced dopaminergic neurons damage. HSYA partially inhibited the expressions of NF-κB p65 and iNOS. Furthermore, HSYA decreased the content of IL-1β, TNF-α and NO in the supernatants. Taken together, these results suggest that HSYA exerts protective effects on LPS-induced neurotoxicity in dopaminergic neurons and the mechanisms may be associated with the inhibition of inflammatory response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30207204>Cocoa beans improve mitochondrial biogenesis via PPARγ/PGC1α dependent signalling pathway in MPP intoxicated human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y).</a></h2><p>Polyphenols are shown to protect from or delay the progression of chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study was aims to gain insight into the role of ahydroalcoholic extract of cocoa (standardised for epicatechin content) on mitochondrial biogenesis in MPP intoxicated human neuroblastoma cells (SHSY5Y). The effects of cocoa on PPARγ, PGC1α, Nrf2 and TFAM protein expression and mitochondrial membrane potential were evaluated. A pre-exposure to cocoa extract decreased reactive oxygen species formation and restored mitochondrial membrane potential. The cocoa extract was found to up-regulate the expression of PPARγ and the downstream signalling proteins PGC1α, Nrf2 and TFAM. It increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCl2 and increased superoxide dismutase activity. Further, the cocoa extract down-regulated the expression of  fission 1 (Fis1) and up-regulated the expression of  fusion 2 (Mfn2) proteins, suggesting an improvement in mitochondrial functions in MPP intoxicated cells upon treatment with cocoa. Interestingly, cocoa up-regulates the expression of  hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis. No change in the expression of PPARγ on treatment with cocoa extract was observed when the cells were pre-treated with PPARγ antagonist GW9662. This data suggests that cocoa mediates mitochondrial biogenesis via a PPARγ/PGC1α dependent signalling pathway and also has the ability to improve dopaminergic functions by increasing  hydroxylase expression. Based on our data, we propose that a cocoa bean extract and products thereof could be used as potential nutritional supplements for neuroprotection in PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29358661>Anthelmintic niclosamide suppresses transcription of BCR-ABL fusion oncogene via disabling Sp1 and induces apoptosis in imatinib-resistant CML cells harboring T315I mutant.</a></h2><p> kinase BCR-ABL fusion protein is the driver in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The gate-keeper mutation T315I is the most challenging mutant due to its resistance to most  kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The third generation TKI ponatinib is the only effective TKI to treat CML patients harboring T315I-BCR-ABL mutation, but with high rate of major arterial thrombotic events. Alternative strategies to specifically target T315I-BCR-ABL are needed for the treatment of CML patients harboring such a mutation. Given that Sp1 is a fundamental transcriptional factor to positively regulate WT-BCR-ABL fusion oncogene, the purpose of this investigation was aimed at evaluating the anti-tumor activity and the underlying mechanism in terms of Sp1 regulational effect on the transcription of T315I-BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. Like in WT-BCR-ABL, we identified enrichment of Sp1 on the promoter of T315I-BCR-ABL fusion gene. Treatment of WT- and T315I-BCR-ABL-expressing CML cells by niclosamide diminished such an enrichment of Sp1, and decreased WT- and T315I-BCR-ABL transcription and its downstream signaling molecules such as STAT5 and Akt. Further, niclosamide significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis through intrinsic pathway. The in vivo efficacy validation of p-niclosamide, a water soluble derivative of niclosamide, showed that p-niclosamide significantly inhibited the tumor burden of nude mice subcutaneously bearing T315I-BCR-ABL-expressing CML cells, and prolonged the survival of allografted leukemic mice harboring BaF3-T315I-BCR-ABL. We conclude that niclosamide is active against T315I-BCR-ABL-expressing cells, and may be a promising agent for CML patients regardless of T315I mutation status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29750960>A novel role for PTK2B in cultured beige adipocyte differentiation.</a></h2><p>Adipocyte differentiation is a tightly regulated process which requires the sequential and organized expression of numerous genes and proteins. Phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins and key transcription factors represents a critical regulatory mechanism of the process leading to adipocyte maturation and modulation of associated metabolic pathways. Despite the recognition of the importance of protein phosphorylation in adipocyte biology, relatively little is known about the role of specific kinases in thermogenic (brown or beige) adipocyte differentiation and function. In this study, we demonstrate that the non-receptor protein  kinase 2 beta (PTK2B) plays a critical role in murine beige adipocyte differentiation. We observed that PTK2B protein expression is associated with beige adipocyte differentiation in cultured, immortalized, inguinal stromal vascular fraction cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-out of Ptk2b results in non-differentiating white adipocytes, and differentiated beige adipocytes with significantly reduced thermogenic gene and protein expression, enlarged lipid droplet size, and altered mitochondrial respiration. Together, our data in a cell culture system provides evidence for a role of PTK2B in the differentiation of murine beige adipocytes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We have reported that phospholipase C-γ1 (PLCγ1) plays a significant role in the hypoxia-induced increase in [Ca] in PASMCs and attendant HPV. In this study, we intended to determine molecular mechanisms for hypoxic Ca and contractile responses in PASMCs. Our data reveal that hypoxic vasoconstriction occurs in pulmonary arteries, but not in mesenteric arteries. Hypoxia caused a large increase in [Ca] in PASMCs, which is diminished by the PLC inhibitor U73122 and not by its inactive analog U73433 . Hypoxia augments PLCγ1-dependent inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP) generation. Exogenous ROS, hydrogen peroxide (HO), increases PLCγ1 phosphorylation at -783 and IP production. IP receptor-1 (IPR1) knock-down remarkably diminishes hypoxia- or HO-induced increase in [Ca]. Hypoxia or HO increases the activity of IPRs, which is significantly reduced in protein kinase C-ε (PKCε) knockout PASMCs. A higher PLCγ1 expression, activity, and basal [Ca] are found in PASMCs, but not in mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells from mice exposed to chronic hypoxia (CH) for 21 days. CH enhances HO- and ATP-induced increase in [Ca] in PASMCs and PLC-dependent, norepinephrine-evoked pulmonary vasoconstriction. In conclusion, acute hypoxia uniquely causes ROS-dependent PLCγ1 activation, IP production, PKCε activation, IPR1 opening, Ca release, and contraction in mouse PASMCs; CH enhances PASM PLCγ1 expression, activity, and function, playing an essential role in pulmonary hypertension in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29683090>Effects of Aging in the Striatum and Substantia Nigra of a Parkinson's Disease Animal Model.</a></h2><p>Aging is a multifactorial process associated with functional deficits, and the brain is more prone to developing chronic degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Several groups have tried to correlate the age-related ultrastructural alterations to the neurodegeneration process using in vivo pharmacological models, but due to the limitations of the animal models, particularly in aged animals, the results are difficult to interpret. In this work, we investigated neurodegeneration induced by rotenone, as a pharmacological model of Parkinson's disease, in both young and aged Wistar rats. We assessed animal mobility,  hydroxylase staining in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive nuclei and reactive oxygen species production in the striatum. Interestingly, the mobility impairment, dopaminergic neuron loss, and elevated number of apoptotic nuclei in the striatum of aged control rats were similar to young rotenone-treated animals. Moreover, we observed many ultrastructural alterations, such as swollen  in the striatum, and massive lipofuscin deposits in the SNpc of the aged rotenone-treated animals. We conclude that the rotenone model can be employed to explore age-related alterations in the ontogeny that can increase vulnerability in the striatum and SNpc, which may contribute to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30222247>Autophagy and mitochondrial metabolism: insights into their role and therapeutic potential in chronic myeloid leukaemia.</a></h2><p>Despite the development of selective BCR-ABL-targeting  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) transforming the management of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), therapy-resistant leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) persist after TKI treatment and present an obstacle to a CML cure. Recently, we and others have made significant contributions to the field by unravelling survival dependencies in LSCs to work towards the goal of eradicating LSCs in CML patients. In this review, we describe these findings focusing on autophagy and mitochondrial metabolism, which have recently been uncovered as two essential processes for LSCs quiescence and survival respectively. In addition, we discuss the therapeutic potential of autophagy and mitochondrial metabolism inhibition as a strategy to eliminate CML cells in patients where the resistance to TKI is driven by BCR-ABL-independent mechanism(s).© 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29193033>Designing a cancer therapeutic peptide by combining the mitochondrial targeting domain of Noxa and ErbB2-targeting moieties.</a></h2><p>Many anticancer drugs target epidermal growth factor receptors to inhibit receptor  kinases and tumor growth.

KWSY:MTD causes membrane permeability which allows propidium iodide entry into the cytosol and the release of HMGB1 into the media, indicative of necrosis. Mitochondrial swelling occurs in response to KWSY:MTD. Moreover, in vivo analysis using a mouse model shows that KWSY:MTD partially suppressed growth in tumor tissue bearing ErbB2-expressing cells, but did not have obvious toxicity in mouse liver or kidney tissue.

However, the underlying mechanism has not been completely elucidated, particularly . This study was designed to study the neurotoxicity of TaClo  by stereotactically injecting TaClo into the striatum of Wistar rats. After the TaClo injections, rats were subjected to an open field test, and their distance travelled and tracks showed decreasing trends over time. The results of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that the motor dysfunction of the TaClo-treated rats was accompanied by reduced dopamine levels in the striatum. Based on the diffusion tensor imaging data, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the nigrostriatal pathway was significantly increased, and subsequent histological staining revealed the demyelination of nigrostriatal fibres after the TaClo treatment. TaClo induced a loss of  hydroxylase-positive cells in the substantia nigra compacta. Regarding the underlying mechanism, TaClo caused oxidative stress in the nigrostriatal system by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species and reducing the  membrane potential. Meanwhile, the elevated expression of Iba-1, TNF-, IL-6, Cox-2, and iNOS indicated microglial activation and a strong innate immune response in the nigrostriatal system. In addition, activated caspase-3 levels were increased. Thus, both mitochondrial impairments and the innate immune response are involved in TaClo-induced neurotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820889>Effects of Preventive Treadmill Exercise on the Recovery of Metabolic and Mitochondrial Factors in the 6-Hydroxydopamine Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h2><p>Metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in Parkinson's disease, while exercise can induce essential pathways of mitochondrial biogenesis. Here, we tested whether long-term preventive treadmill training (16 weeks, 21 m/min, and 0° inclinations for 50 min/d, 5 d/week) effects the mitochondrial and neurodegeneration markers, in the striatum of rats in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of Parkinson's disease. Following 16 weeks of exercise or no exercise period (n = 16 rats per group), the animals were divided into four experimental groups (n = 8 per group): (1) no exercise and saline (SED), (2) exercise and saline (EX), (3) no exercise and 6-OHDA (SED + 6-OHDA), and (4) exercise and 6-OHDA (EX + 6-OHDA). For the model, 8 μg of 6-OHDA (2 μg/μL prepared in a solution of 0.2% ascorbic acid and 0.9% saline) was injected into the right medial forebrain bundle. Exposure to 6-OHDA resulted in a significant reduction (P < 0.05) of mitochondrial factors AMP-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha, and  hydroxylase, and increased expression of silent information regulator T1, mitochondrial transcription factor A, and p53 in the SED + 6-OHDA group relative to SED group. By contrast, gene and protein expressions upon exercise were higher and p53 protein level was lower in the EX + 6-OHDA group compared with SED + 6-OHDA. Further, exercise reduced the extent of weight loss associated with the 6-OHDA injection. In conclusion, exercise might be used to reduce mitochondrial disorders in Parkinson's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30081151>Defective mitochondrial and lysosomal trafficking in chorea-acanthocytosis is independent of Src-kinase signaling.</a></h2><p>Mutations in the VPS13A gene leading to depletion of chorein protein are causative for Chorea Acanthocytosis (ChAc), a rare devastating disease, which is characterized by neurodegeneration mainly affecting the basal ganglia as well as deformation of erythrocytes. Studies on patient blood samples highlighted a dysregulation of Actin cytoskeleton caused by downregulation of the PI3K pathway and hyper-activation of Lyn-kinase, but to what extent these mechanisms are present and relevant in the affected neurons remains elusive. We studied the effects of the absence of chorein protein on the morphology and trafficking of lysosomal and mitochondrial compartments in ChAc patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Numbers of both organelle types were reduced in ChAc MSNs. Mitochondrial length was shortened and their membrane potential showed significant hyperpolarization. In contrast to previous studies, showing Lyn kinase dependency of ChAc-associated pathological events in erythrocytes, pharmacological studies demonstrate that the impairment of  and lysosomes are independent of Lyn kinase activity. These data suggest that impairment in mitochondrial and lysosomal morphologies in MSNs is not mediated by a dysregulation of Lyn kinase and thus the pathological pathways in ChAc might be - at least in part - cell-type specific.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In line with this concept, we show that an anthelminthic drug ivermectin selectively kills chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells via inducing mitochondrial dysfunctions and oxidative stress. Ivermectin is significantly more effective in inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis in CML cell line K562 and primary CML CD34 than normal bone marrow (NBM) CD34 cells. Ivermectin also augments in vitro and in vivo efficacy of standard CML  kinase inhibitors. Mechanistically, ivermectin inhibits respiratory complex I activity and suppresses mitochondrial respiration in K562 and CML CD34 cells. Interestingly, we demonstrate that mitochondrial respiration are lower in NBM CD34 compared to malignant CD34 cells. In addition, ivermectin also induces mitochondrial dysfunctions in NBM CD34 cells in a similar manner as in CML CD34 cells whereas NBM CD34 cells are significantly less sensitive to ivermectin than CML CD34 cells. These suggest that NBM CD34 cells are more tolerable to mitochondrial dysfunctions than CML CD34 cells. Consistently, ivermectin induces higher levels of oxidative stress and damage in CML than normal counterparts. Antioxidant NAC rescues ivermectin's effects, confirming oxidative stress as the mechanism of its action in CML. Our work provides the fundamental evidence to repurpose ivermectin for CML treatment. Our work also highlights the therapeutic value of targeting  respiration in CML.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have reported that PBDEs exposure could induce oxidative stress and disturb mitochondrial functions in mammalian cells. However, the toxicological mechanism remains to be clarified. In this work, the neurotoxic effect and underlying mechanism of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) was investigated by using human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells as an effective model. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach combined with cell viability assay was applied to elucidate the metabolic perturbations and relevant toxicological pathways upon BDE-47 exposure. Our results shown that the SK-N-SH cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to BDE-47 at 24 h within the concentration range of 5-250 μM, and an IC value of 88.8 μM was obtained. Based on the dose-response curve and cell morphological observation, the 5 and 10 μM BDE-47 doses (equal to IC and IC, respectively) were used for metabolomics study to capture the sensitive metabolic response following BDE-47 exposure. After BDE-47 treatment, nine metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers, and the most disturbed metabolic pathways were mainly involved in alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, glutathione metabolism,  and phenylalanine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism, which imply that metabolic changes related to neurotransmitters, oxidative stress, and nucleotide-mediated signal transduction systems were the sensitive pathways mostly influenced. Our findings reported here may provide potential neurotoxic effect biomarkers and prompt deep understanding of the molecular and metabolic mechanisms triggered by BDE-47 exposure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, PV neurons are highly vulnerable to status epilepticus (SE, prolonged seizure activity), although the underlining mechanism remains to be clarified. In the present study, we found that p47Phox expression was transiently and selectively increased in PV neurons 6 h after SE. This up-regulated p47Phox expression was accompanied by excessive mitochondrial fission. In this time point, CDK5- 15 and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-serine 616 phosphorylations were also increased in PV cells. Apocynin (a p47Phox inhibitor) effectively mitigated PV cell loss via inhibition of CDK5/DRP1 phosphorylations and mitochondrial fragmentation induced by SE. Roscovitine (a CDK5 inhibitor) and Mdivi-1 (a DRP1 inhibitor) attenuated SE-induced PV cell loss by inhibiting aberrant mitochondrial fission. These findings suggest that p47Phox/CDK5/DRP1 may be one of the important upstream signaling pathways in PV cell degeneration induced by SE via excessive mitochondrial fragmentation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401089>Unlike reactivity of mono- and binuclear imine-copper(II) complexes toward melanoma cells via a tyrosinase-dependent mechanism.</a></h2><p>The cytotoxicity of a dinuclear imine-copper (II) complex 2, and its analogous mononuclear complex 1, toward different melanoma cells, particularly human SKMEL-05 and SKMEL-147, was investigated. Complex 2, a tyrosinase mimic, showed much higher activity in comparison to complex 1, and its reactivity was verified to be remarkably activated by UVB-light, while the mononuclear compound showed a small or negligible effect. Further, a significant dependence on the melanin content in the tumor cells, both from intrinsic pigmentation or stimulated by irradiation, was observed in the case of complex 2. Similar tests with keratinocytes and melanocytes indicated a much lower sensitivity to both copper (II) complexes, even after exposition to UV light. Clonogenic assays attested that the fractions of melanoma cells survival were much lower under treatment with complex 2 compared to complex 1, both with or without previous irradiation of the cells. The process also involves generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as verified by EPR spectroscopy, and by using fluorescence indicators. Autophagic assays indicated a remarkable formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in melanomas treated with complex 2, while this effect was not observed in similar treatment with complex 1. Monitoring of specific protein LC3 corroborated the simultaneous occurrence of autophagy. A balance interplay between different modes of cell death, apoptosis and autophagy, occurs when melanomas were treated with the dinuclear complex 2, in contrast to the mononuclear complex 1.

Inhibition of TRPM2 in neuroblastoma by depletion with CRISPR technology or expression of dominant negative TRPM2-S has been shown to significantly reduce cell viability. Here, the role of proline-rich  kinase 2 (Pyk2) in TRPM2 modulation of neuroblastoma viability was explored. In TRPM2-depleted cells, phosphorylation and expression of Pyk2 and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), a downstream target, were significantly reduced after application of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. Overexpression of wild-type Pyk2 rescued cell viability. Reduction of Pyk2 expression with shRNA decreased cell viability and CREB phosphorylation and expression, demonstrating Pyk2 modulates CREB activation. TRPM2 depletion impaired phosphorylation of Src, an activator of Pyk2, and this may be a mechanism to reduce Pyk2 phosphorylation. TRPM2 inhibition was previously demonstrated to decrease mitochondrial function. Here, CREB, Pyk2, and phosphorylated Src were reduced in  of TRPM2-depleted cells, consistent with their role in modulating expression and activation of mitochondrial proteins. Phosphorylated Src and phosphorylated and total CREB were reduced in TRPM2-depleted nuclei. Expression and function of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), a target of phosphorylated Pyk2 and CREB, were significantly reduced. Wild-type TRPM2 but not Ca-impermeable mutant E960D reconstituted phosphorylation and expression of Pyk2 and CREB in TRPM2-depleted cells exposed to doxorubicin.

In this study, we explored whether IR injury in isolated hearts induces  nitration of adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) and alters its interaction with the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1). We found that IR injury induced  nitration of ANT and that exposure of isolated cardiac  to ONOO induced ANT , Y, nitration. The exposure of isolated cardiac  to ONOO also led ANT to form high molecular weight proteins and dissociation of ANT from VDAC1. We found that IR injury in isolated hearts, hypoxic injury in H9c2 cells, and ONOO treatment of H9c2 cells and isolated , each decreased mitochondrial bound-hexokinase II (HK II), which suggests that ONOO caused HK II to dissociate from . Moreover, we found that  exposed to ONOO induced VDAC1 oligomerization which may decrease its binding with HK II. We have reported that ONOO produced during cardiac IR injury induced  nitration of VDAC1, which resulted in conformational changes of the protein and increased channel conductance associated with compromised cardiac function on reperfusion. Thus, our results imply that ONOO produced during IR injury and hypoxic stress impeded HK II association with VDAC1. ONOO exposure nitrated mitochondrial proteins and also led to cytochrome c (cyt c) release from . In addition, in isolated  exposed to ONOO or obtained after IR, there was significant compromise in mitochondrial respiration and delayed repolarization of membrane potential during oxidative (ADP) phosphorylation.

Previous work by our group investigated the potential PTM crosstalk on proteins in the EGFR-Ras-c-Fos axis by utilizing a comprehensive set of PTM reagents termed Signal-Seeker toolkits. In this study, these tools were used to investigate the potential PTM crosstalk that occurs in acetylated mitochondrial proteins in response to a mitochondrial stress-inducing agent hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). Mitochondrial protein acetylation has been shown to participate in PTM crosstalk as exemplified by the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex via kinase, phosphatase, acetyltransferase, and deacetylase activities.

Signal-Seeker PTM detection tools were used to validate the acetylation state of ten mitochondrial targets, as well as their endogenous acetylation state in response to H₂O₂. Importantly, the endogenous acetylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation 2/3, and  phosphorylation state of four target mitochondrial proteins were also investigated with the toolkit. Each of the four proteins had unique PTM profiles, but diverging acetylation and ubiquitin or SUMO 2/3 signals appeared to be a common theme. This proof-of-concept study identifies the Signal-Seeker toolkits as a useful tool to investigate potential PTM crosstalk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233700>Reduced cytochrome oxidase activity and increased protein  phosphorylation of -rich fractions of buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) spermatozoa after a cycle of freezing and thawing.</a></h2><p>The motility and fertility of mammalian spermatozoa are compromised when they are cryopreserved. Sperm mitochondrial proteins play a vital role in conferring motility. However, the effects of cryopreservation on -specific proteins remain primarily unexplored in domestic animals, including buffaloes, so the present study aimed to evaluate this issue.  were isolated from both non-cryopreserved and cryopreserved buffalo spermatozoa by sonication followed by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The purity of the mitochondrial preparation was assessed by cytochrome oxidase assay and electron microscopy.  separated from cryopreserved buffalo spermatozoa were associated with significantly lower (P ≤ 0.05) cytochrome oxidase activity as compared with non-cryopreserved spermatozoa. The intensities of two low-molecular-mass mitochondrial proteins (30.1 kDa and 26.1 kDa) were significantly reduced as compared with the non-cryopreserved group. In addition, in cryopreserved buffalo sperm , the intensities of three  phosphorylated proteins (126.6, 106.7 and 26 kDa) increased significantly compared with the non-cryopreserved group. Of these,  phosphorylation of the 26-kDa mitochondrial protein of cryopreserved sperm was very intense and unique because it could not be detected in the  of non-cryopreserved sperm. Thus, the study confirmed that both cytochrome oxidase activity and the proteins of buffalo sperm  undergo significant cryogenic changes in terms of quantity and quality after a cycle of freezing and thawing and this may be one of the important causes of reduced post-thaw motility and fertility of cryopreserved buffalo spermatozoa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336718>Auraptene Mitigates Parkinson's Disease-Like Behavior by Protecting Inhibition of Mitochondrial Respiration and Scavenging Reactive Oxygen Species.</a></h2><p>Current therapeutics for Parkinson's disease (PD) are only effective in providing relief of symptoms such as rigidity, tremors and bradykinesia, and do not exert disease-modifying effects by directly modulating mitochondrial function. Here, we investigated auraptene (AUR) as a potent therapeutic reagent that specifically protects neurotoxin-induced reduction of mitochondrial respiration and inhibits reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Further, we explored the mechanism and potency of AUR in protecting dopaminergic neurons. Treatment with AUR significantly increased the viability of substantia nigra (SN)-derived SN4741 embryonic dopaminergic neuronal cells and reduced rotenone-induced mitochondrial ROS production. By inducing antioxidant enzymes AUR treatment also increased oxygen consumption rate. These results indicate that AUR exerts a protective effect against rotenone-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage. We further assessed AUR effects in vivo, investigating  hydroxylase (TH) expression in the striatum and substantia nigra of MPTP-induced PD model mice and behavioral changes after injection of AUR. AUR treatment improved movement, consistent with the observed increase in the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. These results demonstrate that AUR targets dual pathogenic mechanisms, enhancing mitochondrial respiration and attenuating ROS production, suggesting that the preventative potential of this natural compound could lead to improvement in PD-related neurobiological changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30637731>Trpm2 enhances physiological bioenergetics and protects against pathological oxidative cardiac injury: Role of Pyk2 phosphorylation.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms by which Trpm2 channels enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics and protect against oxidative stress-induced cardiac injury remain unclear. Here, the role of proline-rich  kinase 2 (Pyk2) in Trpm2 signaling is explored. Activation of Trpm2 in adult myocytes with H O resulted in 10- to 21-fold increases in Pyk2 phosphorylation in wild-type (WT) myocytes which was significantly lower (~40%) in Trpm2 knockout (KO) myocytes. Pyk2 phosphorylation was inhibited (~54%) by the Trpm2 blocker clotrimazole. Buffering Trpm2-mediated Ca increase with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) resulted in significantly reduced pPyk2 in WT but not in KO myocytes, indicating Ca influx through activated Trpm2 channels phosphorylated Pyk2. Part of phosphorylated Pyk2 translocated from cytosol to  which has been previously shown to augment mitochondrial Ca uptake and enhance adenosine triphosphate generation. Although Trpm2-mediated Ca influx phosphorylated Ca -calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII), the CaMKII inhibitor KN93 did not significantly affect Pyk2 phosphorylation in H O -treated WT myocytes. After ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), Pyk2 phosphorylation and its downstream prosurvival signaling molecules (pERK1/2 and pAkt) were significantly lower in KO-I/R when compared with WT-I/R hearts. After hypoxia/reoxygenation, mitochondrial membrane potential was lower and superoxide level was higher in KO myocytes, and were restored to WT values by the -targeted superoxide scavenger MitoTempo. Our results suggested that Ca influx via tonically activated Trpm2 phosphorylated Pyk2, part of which translocated to , resulting in better mitochondrial bioenergetics to maintain cardiac health. After I/R, Pyk2 activated prosurvival signaling molecules and prevented excessive increases in reactive oxygen species, thereby affording protection from I/R injury.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30145880>LC-MS/MS Proteoform Profiling Exposes Cytochrome c Peroxidase Self-Oxidation in  and Functionally Important Hole Hopping from Its Heme.</a></h2><p>LC-MS/MS profiling reveals that the proteoforms of cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp1) isolated from respiring yeast  are oxidized at numerous Met, Trp, and Tyr residues. In vitro oxidation of recombinant Ccp1 by HO in the absence of its reducing substrate, ferrocytochrome c, gives rise to similar proteoforms, indicating uncoupling of Ccp1 oxidation and reduction in . The oxidative modifications found in the Ccp1 proteoforms are consistent with radical transfer (hole hopping) from the heme along several chains of redox-active residues (Trp, Met, Tyr). These modifications delineate likely hole-hopping pathways to novel substrate-binding sites. Moreover, a decrease in recombinant Ccp1 oxidation by HO in vitro in the presence of glutathione supports a protective role for hole hopping to this antioxidant. Isolation and characterization of extramitochondrial Ccp1 proteoforms reveals that hole hopping from the heme in these proteoforms results in selective oxidation of the proximal heme ligand (H175) and heme labilization. Previously, we demonstrated that this labilized heme is recruited for catalase maturation (Kathiresan, M.; Martins, D.; English, A. M. Respiration triggers heme transfer from cytochrome c peroxidase to catalase in yeast . Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014, 111, 17468-17473; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1409692111 ). Following heme release, apoCcp1 exits , yielding the extramitochondrial proteoforms that we characterize here. The targeting of Ccp1 for selective H175 oxidation may be linked to the phosphorylation status of Y153 close to the heme since pY153 is abundant in certain proteoforms. In sum, when insufficient electrons from ferrocytochrome c are available to Ccp1 in , hole hopping from its heme expands its physiological functions. Specifically, we observe an unprecedented hole-hopping sequence for heme labilization and identify hole-hopping pathways from the heme to novel substrates and to glutathione at Ccp1's surface. Furthermore, our results underscore the power of proteoform profiling by LC-MS/MS in exploring the cellular roles of oxidoreductases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30315766>AP39, a Modulator of Mitochondrial Bioenergetics, Reduces Antiangiogenic Response and Oxidative Stress in Hypoxia-Exposed Trophoblasts: Relevance for Preeclampsia Pathogenesis.</a></h2><p>Although the cause of preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication with significant maternal and neonatal morbidity, has not been fully characterized, placental ischemia attributable to impaired spiral artery remodeling and abnormal secretion of antiangiogenic factors are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of the disease. Placental ischemia could impair trophoblast mitochondrial function and energy production, leading to the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS have been shown to stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, which, in turn, may induce transcription of antiangiogenic factors, soluble fms-like  kinase 1 (sFLT1), and soluble endoglin in trophoblasts. Herein, we tested whether the angiogenic imbalance and oxidative stress in the preeclamptic placenta may be prevented by improving mitochondrial function. First, to evaluate the cause-effect relationship between mitochondrial function and sFLT1 production, a human trophoblast primary cell culture model was established in which hypoxia induced mitochondrial ROS production and concurrent sFLT1 increase. Second, treatment with AP39, a novel -targeted hydrogen sulfide donor, prevented ROS production, reduced HIF-1α protein levels, and diminished sFLT1 production. Finally, AP39, a modulator of mitochondrial bioenergetics enhanced cytochrome c oxidase activity, reversed oxidative stress and antiangiogenic response in hypoxic trophoblasts. These results suggest that placental hypoxia induces ROS production, HIF-1α stabilization, and sFLT1 up-regulation; these pathophysiological alterations can be attenuated by mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Despite the identification of several neurodegeneration-associated mutations in the  gene, few studies have assessed its physiological role. Here, we investigated CHCHD10's function as a regulator of oxidative phosphorylation in the  and the nucleus. We show that CHCHD10 copurifies with cytochrome  oxidase (COX) and up-regulates COX activity by serving as a scaffolding protein required for MNRR1 phosphorylation, mediated by ARG (ABL proto-oncogene 2, nonreceptor  kinase (ABL2)). The  gene was maximally transcribed in cultured cells at 8% oxygen, unlike , which was maximally expressed at 4%, suggesting a fine-tuned oxygen-sensing system that adapts to the varying oxygen concentrations in the human body under physiological conditions. We show that nuclear CHCHD10 protein down-regulates the expression of genes harboring the oxygen-responsive element (ORE) in their promoters by interacting with and augmenting the activity of the largely uncharacterized transcriptional repressor CXXC finger protein 5 (CXXC5). We further show that two genetic CHCHD10 disease variants, G66V and P80L, in the  exhibit faulty interactions with MNRR1 and COX, reducing respiration and increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), and in the nucleus abrogating transcriptional repression of ORE-containing genes. Our results reveal that CHCHD10 positively regulates mitochondrial respiration and contributes to transcriptional repression of ORE-containing genes in the nucleus, and that genetic CHCHD10 variants are impaired in these activities.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655049>Loss of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (Pink1) reduces hippocampal  hydroxylase and impairs learning and memory.</a></h2><p>Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced kinase 1 (Pink1) is involved in mitochondrial quality control, which is essential for maintaining energy production and minimizing oxidative damage from dysfunctional/depolarized . Pink1 mutations are the second most common cause of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition to characteristic motor impairments, PD patients also commonly exhibit cognitive impairments. As the hippocampus plays a prominent role in cognition, we tested if loss of Pink1 in mice influences learning and memory. While wild-type mice were able to perform a contextual discrimination task, age-matched Pink1 knockout (Pink1) mice showed an impaired ability to differentiate between two similar contexts. Similarly, Pink1 mice performed poorly in a delayed alternation task as compared to age-matched controls. Poor performance in these cognitive tasks was not the result of overt hippocampal pathology. However, a significant reduction in hippocampal  hydroxylase (TH) protein levels was detected in the Pink1 mice. This decrease in hippocampal TH levels was also associated with reduced DOPA decarboxylase and dopamine D2 receptor levels, but not post-synaptic dopamine D1 receptor levels. These presynaptic changes appeared to be selective for dopaminergic fibers as hippocampal dopamine beta hydroxylase, choline acetyltransferase, and tryptophan hydroxylase levels were unchanged in Pink1 mice. Administration of the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 to Pink1 mice was found to improve performance in the context discrimination task. Taken together, our results show that Pink1 loss may alter dopamine signaling in the hippocampus, which could be a contributing mechanism for the observed learning and memory impairments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we demonstrate that mouse bone marrow-derived TORC2-deficient myeloid DC (TORC2 DC) utilize an altered metabolic program, characterized by enhanced baseline glycolytic function compared to wild-type WT control (Ctrl) DC, increased dependence on glycolytic ATP production, elevated lipid content and higher viability following stimulation with LPS. In addition, TORC2 DC display an increased spare respiratory capacity (SRC) compared to WT Ctrl DC; this metabolic phenotype corresponds with increased mitochondrial mass and mean mitochondrial DNA copy number, and failure of TORC2 DC  to depolarize following LPS stimulation. Our data suggest that the enhanced metabolic activity of TORC2 DC may be due to compensatory TORC1 pathway activity, namely increased expression of multiple genes upstream of Akt/TORC1 activity, including the integrin alpha IIb, protein  kinase 2/focal adhesion kinase, IL-7R and Janus kinase 1(JAK1), and the activation of downstream targets of TORC1, including p70S6K, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and CD36 (fatty acid translocase). These enhanced TORC1 pathway activities may culminate in increased expression of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparγ) that regulates fatty acid storage, and the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1). Taken together, our data suggest that TORC2 may function to restrain TORC1-driven metabolic activity and mitochondrial regulation in myeloid DC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29881271>Naked physically synthesized gold nanoparticles affect migration, mitochondrial activity, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis and vascular injuries in terms of proliferation and migration. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-migratory and proliferative effects of naked gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on VSMCs.One set of physically synthesized AuNPs (pAuNPs) and three sets of chemically synthesized AuNPs (cAuNPs) were tested.Among them, the pAuNPs were found to significantly and markedly inhibit platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced VSMC migration. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the pAuNPs were ingested and aggregated in the cytoplasm at an early stage of treatment, while the viability of VSMCs was not affected within 24 hours of treatment. The pAuNP treatment enhanced cellular mitochondrial activity but inhibited basal and PDGF-induced VSMC proliferation, as determined by MTT, WST-1, and BrdU cell proliferation assays. Furthermore, the pAuNPs did not interfere with PDGF signaling or matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression/activity. Unlike the cAuNPs, the pAuNPs could markedly reduce VSMC adhesion to collagen, which was supported by the findings that the pAuNPs could inhibit collagen-induced  protein and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and actin cytoskeleton reorganization during cell adhesion. The in vitro effects of the pAuNPs were confirmed in the in vivo rat balloon-injured carotid artery model by diminishing the proliferating VSMCs.Taken together, the present study provides the first evidence that naked pAuNPs can reduce VSMC migration and compromise cell adhesion by affecting FAK and -protein activation. The pAuNPs also have an inhibitory effect on PDGF-induced VSMC proliferation and can reduce proliferating/migrating VSMC expression in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29859424>Ultracytochemical visualization of calcium distribution in heart cells and erythrocytes of zebrafish Danio rerio.</a></h2><p>Detection of patterns of subcellular calcium distribution in the cardiovascular system can contribute to understanding its role in cardiac and blood function. The present study localized calcium in heart atrium, ventricle, and bulbus arteriosus as well as in erythrocytes of zebrafish Danio rerio using an oxalate-pyroantimonate technique combined with transmission electron microscopy. Intracellular calcium stores were detected in caveolae, , and the nuclei of several zebrafish cardiac cell types. Melanin pigmentation containing calcium stores was detected in the pericardial cavity. Melanin might be an extracellular source of calcium for heart beating and/or a lubricant to prevent friction during beating process. Calcium deposits were also detected in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus of erythrocytes as well as in blood plasma. Possible exchange of calcium between erythrocytes and blood plasma was observed. Interactions of such calcium stores and possible contribution of extracellular calcium stores such as melanin pigmentation to supply calcium for vital functions of heart cells should be addressed in future studies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, ∼60% of patients relapse after the discontinuation of TKIs. Relapse after discontinuation is likely due the inability of TKIs to eradicate CML stem cells (CML-LSCs). In our previous study, 12 out of 22 patients maintained a stable DMR after TKI withdrawal, and we found that fewer patients who were treated with second-generation TKI relapsed compared with those receiving imatinib. Therefore, we hypothesized that second-generation TKIs and imatinib may have different effects on CML-LSCs, which may affect the clinical outcome after TKI discontinuation. To investigate this, we established a TKI discontinuation model in vitro by treating CML CD34 cells with imatinib and dasatinib continuously for 72 h and then removing the TKI for 24 h. Colony-forming cell (CFC) assays, apoptosis assessment, and proteomic analysis were then performed. We found that TKI discontinuation resulted in less proliferation and CFC output in dasatinib-treated cells compared with imatinib. However, the dasatinib-treated group exhibited increased apoptosis. In the proteomics analysis, we identified 160 upregulated and 151 downregulated proteins when the two TKI discontinuation groups were compared. Importantly, proteins involved in NAD nucleosidase activity, mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled proton transport, and oxidative phosphorylation were significantly expressed, which were mainly involved in metabolic processes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that imatinib and dasatinib have clear differential effects on CML-LSCs through the regulation of  oxidative phosphorylation, which may provide a new target for eliminating CML-LSCs in the context of TKI discontinuation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384123>Effects of estrogen and aging on synaptic morphology and distribution of phosphorylated Tyr1472 NR2B in the female rat hippocampus.</a></h2><p>Age and estrogens may impact the mobility of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in hippocampal synapses. Here, we used serial section immunogold electron microscopy to examine whether phosphorylated  1472 NR2B (pY1472), which is involved in the surface expression of NMDARs, is altered in the dorsal hippocampus of young (3-4 months old) and aged (∼24 months old) ovariectomized rats treated with 17β-estradiol or vehicle for 2 days. The number of gold particles labeling pY1472 was higher in presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of aged rats with low estradiol (vehicle-treated) compared to other groups. In terminals, pY1472 levels were elevated in aged rats but reduced by estradiol treatment to levels seen in young rats. Conversely, the  number was lower in aged females but was restored to young levels by estradiol. In the postsynaptic density and dendritic spines, estradiol reduced pY1472 in young and aged rats. As phosphorylation at Y1472 blocks NR2B endocytosis, reduction of pY1472 by estradiol suggests another mechanism through which estrogen enhances synaptic plasticity by altering localization of NMDAR subunits within synapses.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Wistar rats were submitted to stereotaxic surgery and received a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), OUA, or AR-A014418. After 7 days, the animals were submitted to open-field test. After behavioral analysis, the brains were dissected in frontal cortex and hippocampus to the evaluation of oxidative stress. The OUA induced manic-like behavior in rats, which was reversed by AR-A014418 treatment. The ICV administration of OUA increases the levels of superoxide in submitochondrial particles, lipid hydroperoxide (LPH), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), 8-isoprostane, protein carbonyl, 3-nitrotyrosine, and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR) in both structures evaluated. In general, the treatment with AR-A014418 reversed these effects of OUA on the submitochondrial particles, LPH, 4-HNE, 8-isoprostane, protein carbonyl, 3-nitrotyrosine levels, and SOD activity. Furthermore, the injection of OUA decreased the catalase activity, and AR-A014418 promoted an increase in activity of this enzyme in the brain structures. These results suggest that GSK-3β inhibition can modulate manic-like behaviors. Also, it can be suggested that inhibition of GSK-3β can be effective against oxidative stress. However, more studies are needed to better elucidate these mechanisms.

Ganoderma lucidum (GL) has emerged as a novel agent that protects neurons from oxidative stress. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying GL-induced neuroprotection have not been documented. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of GL extract (GLE) and the underlying mechanisms in the classic MPTP(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced mouse model of PD. Mice were injected with MPTP to induce parkinsonism. Then the mice were administered GLE (400 mg kg d, ig) for 4 weeks. We observed that GLE administration significantly improved locomotor performance and increased  hydroxylase expression in the substantia nigra pars compact (SNpc) of MPTP-treated mice. In in vitro study, treatment of neuroblastoma neuro-2a cells with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP, 1 mmol/L) caused mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, radical oxygen species accumulation, and ATP depletion. Application of GLE (800 μg/mL) protected neuroblastoma neuro-2a cells against MPP insult. Application of GLE also improved mitochondrial movement dysfunction in cultured primary mesencephalic neurons. In addition, GLE counteracted the decline in NIX (also called BNIP3L) expression and increase in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio evoked by MPP. Moreover, GLE reactivated MPP-inhibited AMPK, mTOR, and ULK1. Similarly, GLE was sufficient to counteract MPP-induced inhibition of PINK1 and Parkin expression. GLE suppressed MPP-induced cytochrome C release and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. In summary, our results provide evidence that GLE ameliorates parkinsonism pathology via regulating mitochondrial function, autophagy, and apoptosis, which may involve the activation of both the AMPK/mTOR and PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30067941>Dopaminergic neurotoxic effects of 3-TFMPP derivatives.</a></h2><p>Designer drugs are synthetically formulated to mimic the psychostimulatory effects of an original controlled/illegal drug of abuse.

Apart from its effects on the monoamine systems in the brain, recent in vitro investigations have revealed cytotoxicity. In this study, the effects of increasing concentrations (10-1000 μM) of 3,4-Catechol-PV, one of major MDPV metabolites, on cell viability, morphology, and apoptosis have been evaluated after acute exposure (24-48 h) in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells-undifferentiated and differentiated to a more mature neuronal-like phenotype. Results indicated the following: (i) Cell viability: concentration-dependent decrease (15-55%) in differentiated SH-SY5Y after 24 h, with no exacerbation after 48 h (LC values 1028 and 951 μM, respectively); marked concentration-dependent decrease after 48 h (20-63%) in undifferentiated SH-SY5Y (LC 553.9 μM) with mild effect (18-22% cell death) after 24 h at ≥ 500 μM only; the lowest toxic concentrations were 500 and 100 μM after 24 h, for undifferentiated and differentiated SH-SY5Y, respectively, and 10 μM after 48 h. (ii) Concentration- and time-dependent alterations of cell morphology in both SH-SY5Y types characterized by several intracellular cytoplasmic vesicles (undifferentiated more susceptible (effect at ≥ 50 μM) than differentiated cells (effect at ≥ 100 μM)), loss of the typical cell shape, neurite retraction, and cell density decrease. (iii) Activation of caspase-3 enzyme in differentiated and undifferentiated cells after 48 h. These findings suggest the potential involvement of 3,4-Catechol-PV in MDPV-induced neurotoxicity and support the use of this human cellular model as a species-specific in vitro tool to clarify the neurotoxicity mechanisms of synthetic cathinones and metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29489891>Subcellular distribution of ERK phosphorylation in  and threonine depends on redox status in murine lung cells.</a></h2><p>Activation of ERK1/2 implies the phosphorylation of  (pTyr) and threonine (pThr) by MEK1/2; both reactions were thought to be cytoplasmic, promoting ERK to reach the nucleus where it activates several transcription factors. In addition, H2O2 concentrations are known to modulate ERK intracellular translocation, which impacts on cellular proliferation. In this context, the objective of this work was to study the sequence of ERK phosphorylation under two redox conditions and to analyze a putative mitochondrial contribution to this process, in LP07 murine lung cells. A time-course of H2O2 administration was used and ERK phosphorylation was analyzed in cytosol,  and nuclei. At 1μM H2O2, a proliferative redox stimulus, immunoblot revealed a fast and transient increase in cytosol pTyr and a sustained increase in mitochondrial pTyr content. The detection for pThr/pTyrERK (2pERK) showed in cytosol a marked increase at 5 minutes with a fast dephosphorylation after that time, for both H2O2 concentrations. However, at 50 μM H2O2, an anti-proliferative condition, 2pERK was gradually retained in . Interestingly, these results were confirmed by in vivo experiments using mice treated with a highly oxidizing agent [H2O2]. By the use of two ERK2 mutant constructions, where Tyr and Thr were replaced by alanine, we confirmed that 2pERK relied almost completely on pThr183. Confocal microscopy confirmed ERK subcellular distribution dependence on the incidence of cytosolic pTyr and mitochondrial pThr at 1μM H2O2. This work shows for the first time, both in vitro and in vivo, an ERK cycle involving a cross-talk between cytosol and  phosphorylation events, which may play a significant role in cell cycle progression, proliferation or differentiation under two different redox conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30290020>Nilotinib induction of melanogenesis via reactive oxygen species-dependent JNK activation in B16F0 mouse melanoma cells.</a></h2><p>Nilotinib (AMN), a second-generation  kinase inhibitor, induces apoptosis in various cancer cells, and our recent study showed that AMN effectively reduced the viability of human ovarian cancer cells via mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis. The effect of AMN in the melanogenesis of melanoma cells is still unclear. In the present study, we found that the addition of AMN but not imatinib (STI) significantly increased the darkness of B16F0 melanoma cells, and the absorptive value increased with the concentration of AMN. A decrease in the viability of B16F0 cells by AMN was detected in a concentration-dependent manner, accompanied by increased DNA ladders, hypodiploid cells and cleavage of the caspase-3 protein. An in vitro tyrosinase (TYR) activity assay showed that increased TYR activity by AMN was detected in a concentration-dependent manner; however, induction of TYR activity by STI at a concentration of 40 μmol/L was observed. Increased intracellular peroxide by AMN was detected in B16F0 cells, and application of the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), significantly reduced AMN-induced peroxide production which also reduced the darkness of B16F0 cells. Additionally, AMN induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) protein phosphorylation in B16F0 cells, which was inhibited by the addition of NAC. AMN-induced melanogenesis of B16F0 cells was significantly inhibited by the addition of NAC and the JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (SP). Data of Western blotting showed that increased protein levels of melanogenesis-related enzymes of tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP1), TRP2 and TYR were observed in AMN-treated B16F0 cells which were inhibited by the addition of NAC and SP. Evidence is provided supporting AMN effectively inducing the melanogenesis of B16F0 melanoma cells via reactive oxygen species-dependent JNK activation.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Accumulating evidence shows that heteronemin may act as a potent anticancer agent in clinical therapy. To fully understand the antitumor mechanism of heteronemin, we further explored the precise molecular targets in prostate cancer cells. Initially, heteronemin exhibited potent cytotoxic effect against LNcap and PC3 prostate cancer cells with IC 1.4 and 2.7 &mu;M after 24 h, respectively. In the xenograft animal model, the tumor size was significantly suppressed to about 51.9% in the heteronemin-treated group in comparison with the control group with no significant difference in the mice body weights. In addition, the results of a cell-free system assay indicated that heteronemin could act as topoisomerase II (topo II) catalytic inhibitor through the elimination of essential enzymatic activity of topoisomerase II&alpha; expression. We found that the use of heteronemin-triggered apoptosis by 20.1⁻68.3%, caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by 66.9⁻99.1% and promoted calcium release by 1.8-, 2.0-, and 2.1-fold compared with the control group in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by annexin-V/PI, rhodamine 123 and Fluo-3 staining assays, respectively. Moreover, our findings indicated that the pretreatment of LNcap cells with an inhibitor of protein  phosphatase (PTPi) diminished growth inhibition, oxidative and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress, as well as activation of Chop/Hsp70 induced by heteronemin, suggesting PTP activation plays a crucial rule in the cytotoxic activity of heteronemin. Using molecular docking analysis, heteronemin exhibited more binding affinity to the N-terminal ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90 protein than 17-AAG, a standard Hsp90 inhibitor. Finally, heteronemin promoted autophagy and apoptosis through the inhibition of Hsp 90 and topo II as well as PTP activation in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, these multiple targets present heteronemin as an interesting candidate for its future development as an antiprostatic agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29679259>DNA Methylation-a Potential Source of  DNA Base Mismatch in the Development of Diabetic Retinopathy.</a></h2><p>In the development of diabetic retinopathy, retinal  are dysfunctional, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is damaged with increased base mismatches and hypermethylated cytosines. DNA methylation is also a potential source of mutation, and in diabetes, the noncoding region, the displacement loop (D-loop), experiences more methylation and base mismatches than other regions of the mtDNA. Our aim was to investigate a possible crosstalk between mtDNA methylation and base mismatches in the development of diabetic retinopathy. The effect of inhibition of Dnmts (by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or Dnmt1-siRNA) on glucose-induced mtDNA base mismatches was investigated in human retinal endothelial cells by surveyor endonuclease digestion and validated by Sanger sequencing. The role of deamination factors on increased base mismatches was determined in the cells genetically modulated for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Sod2) or cytidine-deaminase (APOBEC3A). The results were confirmed in an in vivo model using retinal microvasculature from diabetic mice overexpressing Sod2. Inhibition of DNA methylation, or regulation of cytosine deamination, significantly inhibited an increase in base mismatches at the D-loop and prevented mitochondrial dysfunction. Overexpression of Sod2 in mice also prevented diabetes-induced D-loop hypermethylation and increase in base mismatches. The crosstalk between DNA methylation and base mismatches continued even after termination of hyperglycemia, suggesting its role in the metabolic memory phenomenon associated with the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Inhibition of DNA methylation limits the availability of methylated cytosine for deamination, suggesting a crosstalk between DNA methylation and base mismatches. Thus, regulation of DNA methylation, or its deamination, should impede the development of diabetic retinopathy by preventing formation of base mismatches and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310736>Breast cancer: Occluded role of  N-acetylserotonin/melatonin ratio in co-ordinating pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>A plethora of factors contribute to the biochemical underpinnings of breast cancer, in the absence of any clear, integrative framework. This article proposes that melatonergic pathway regulation within  provides an integrative framework for the wide array of data driving breast cancer pathophysiology. As melatonin is toxic to breast cancer cells, its production within  poses a significant challenge to breast cancer cell survival. Consequently, the diverse plasticity in breast cancer cells may arise from a requirement to decrease  melatonin synthesis. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor role in breast cancer pathophysiology may be mediated by an increase in cytochrome P450 (CYP)1b1 in , leading to the backward conversion of melatonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS). NAS has distinct effects to melatonin, including its activation of the  receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor. TrkB activation significantly contributes to breast cancer cell survival and migration. However, the most important aspect of NAS induction by CYP1b1 in breast cancer cells is the prevention of melatonin effects in . Many of the changes occurring in breast cancer cells arise from the need to regulate this pathway in , allowing this to provide a framework that integrates a host of previously disparate data, including: microRNAs, estrogen, 14-3-3 proteins, sirtuins, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and the kynurenine pathways. It is also proposed that this framework provides a pathoetiological model incorporating the early developmental regulation of the gut microbiome that integrates breast cancer risk factors, including obesity. This has significant treatment, prevention and research implications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, TKIs primarily target differentiated cells and do not eliminate leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Therefore, targeting minimal residual disease to prevent acquired resistance and/or disease relapse requires identification of new LSC-selective target(s) that can be exploited therapeutically. Considering that malignant transformation involves cellular metabolic changes, which may in turn render the transformed cells susceptible to specific assaults in a selective manner, we searched for such vulnerabilities in CML LSCs. We performed metabolic analyses on both stem cell-enriched (CD34 and CD34CD38) and differentiated (CD34) cells derived from individuals with CML, and we compared the signature of these cells with that of their normal counterparts. Through combination of stable isotope-assisted metabolomics with functional assays, we demonstrate that primitive CML cells rely on upregulated oxidative metabolism for their survival. We also show that combination treatment with imatinib and tigecycline, an antibiotic that inhibits mitochondrial protein translation, selectively eradicates CML LSCs both in vitro and in a xenotransplantation model of human CML. Our findings provide a strong rationale for investigation of the use of TKIs in combination with tigecycline to treat patients with CML with minimal residual disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946869>Inhibition of USP9X induces apoptosis in FLT3-ITD-positive AML cells cooperatively by inhibiting the mutant kinase through aggresomal translocation and inducing oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD are the most frequent mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the former associated with a poor prognosis. Here we show that inhibition of the deubiquitinase USP9X by its inhibitor WP1130 or EOAI3402143 (G9) induces apoptosis preferentially in cells transformed by these mutant kinases, including FLT3-ITD-positive AML cell line MV4-11 and primary AML cells. Mechanistically, WP1130 induced aggresomal translocation of the mutant kinases, particularly FLT3-ITD in its activated and autophosphorylated conformation, to block the downstream signaling events, which was aggravated by knock down of USP9X. Moreover, USP9X physically associated with FLT3-ITD to inhibit its K63-linked polyubiquitination, while FLT3-ITD induced  phosphorylation and degradation of USP9X through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. WP1130 or G9 also induced oxidative stress to stimulate stress-related MAP kinase pathways and DNA damage responses to activate in cooperation with inhibition of FLT3-ITD signaling the intrinsic -mediated apoptotic pathway, which was synergistically enhanced by BH3 mimetics and prevented by overexpression of Bcl-xL or Mcl-1. Thus, USP9X represents a promising target for novel therapies against therapy-resistant FLT3-ITD-positive AML.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence suggests that several endogenously formed 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-mimicking chemicals that are metabolic conversion products, especially β-carbolines and isoquinolines, act as neurotoxins that induce PD or enhance progression of the disease. We have demonstrated previously that mitochondrially targeted human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), supported by mitochondrial adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase, can efficiently catalyze the conversion of MPTP to the toxic 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion. In this study, we show that the mitochondrially targeted CYP2D6 can efficiently catalyze MPTP-mimicking compounds,  2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline, and 9-methyl-norharmon, suspected to induce PD in humans. Our results reveal that activity and respiration in mouse brain mitochondrial complex I are significantly affected by these toxins in WT mice but remain unchanged in Cyp2d6 locus knockout mice, indicating a possible role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of these compounds both  and  These metabolic effects were minimized in the presence of two CYP2D6 inhibitors, quinidine and ajmalicine. Neuro-2a cells stably expressing predominantly mitochondrially targeted CYP2D6 were more sensitive to toxin-mediated respiratory dysfunction and complex I inhibition than cells expressing predominantly endoplasmic reticulum-targeted CYP2D6. Exposure to these toxins also induced the autophagic marker Parkin and the mitochondrial fission marker Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in differentiated neurons expressing mitochondrial CYP2D6. Our results show that monomethylamines are converted to their toxic cationic form by mitochondrially directed CYP2D6 and result in neuronal degradation in mice.© 2019 Chattopadhyay et al.</p></html>
