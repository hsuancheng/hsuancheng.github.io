We measured changes in the proteome associated with bacterially induced intestinal inflammation in the interleukin 10 gene-deficient (Il10(-/-)) mouse model of , established effects of the dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) n-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and n-6 arachidonic  (AA) on protein expression (using  as a control fatty ), and compared these changes with previously observed transcriptome changes in the same model. Ingenuity pathways analysis of proteomics data showed bacterially induced inflammation was associated with reduced expression of proteins from pathways of metabolism and digestion/absorption/excretion of nutrients/ions, and increased expression of cellular stress and immune response proteins. Both PUFA treatments showed anti-inflammatory activity; EPA appeared to act via the PPARα pathway, whereas AA appeared to increase energy metabolism and cytoskeletal organization and reduce cellular stress responses, possibly enabling a more robust response to inflammation. While there was agreement between proteomic and transcriptomic data with respect to pathways, there was limited concordance between individual gene and protein data, reflecting the importance of having both gene and protein data to better understand complex diseases such as .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021137>A lipidomics investigation into the intervention of celastrol in experimental colitis.</a></h2><p>Celastrol is well known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. In this study, the efficacy of celastrol against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammatory bowel disease () in mice was established and the mechanism was investigated using lipidomics. Celastrol treatment significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice, as revealed by the body weight, colon length, scores of rectal bleeding and diarrhea, serum TNF-α level, and histological analysis results. Lipidomics analysis based on UPLC/MS revealed characteristic changes in the metabolic profiles of the colitis mice, with altered levels of lipid markers associated with , including LPC18 : 0, LPC18 : 1, LPC18 : 2, sphingomyelin (SM), and increased LPC18 : 0/LPC18 : 1 and LPC18 : 0/LPC18 : 2 ratios. For the celastrol-treated colitis mice, however, levels of the above lipid markers were restored, together with recovered saturated LPC/unsaturated LPC ratios. Accordingly, using GC-MS analysis, increased stearic  (C18 : 0)/ (C18 : 1) and stearic  (C18 : 0)/linoleic  (C18 : 2) ratios were observed in colitis mice, which were later recovered after celastrol treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the liver expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), the key enzyme controlling the desaturation of saturated fatty , was dramatically inhibited in  mice, and was obviously recovered after celastrol treatment. These results suggest that the increased saturated LPC/unsaturated LPC (and saturated fatty /unsaturated fatty ) ratios associated with SCD1 down-regulation could be regarded as biomarkers of colitis, and celastrol alleviates DSS-induced colitis partially via up-regulation of SCD1, restoring the altered balance between stearic - and -derived lipid species, which plays an important role in alleviating colitis. In all, this study provided the scientific basis for further development of celastrol in treating .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17574631>Nutrigenomics applied to an animal model of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: transcriptomic analysis of the effects of eicosapentaenoic - and arachidonic -enriched diets.</a></h2><p>In vivo models of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases () elucidate important mechanisms of chronic inflammation. Complex intestinal responses to food components create a unique "fingerprint" discriminating health from disease. Five-week-old IL10(-/-) and C57BL/6J (C57; control) mice were inoculated orally with complex intestinal microflora (CIF) and/or pure cultures of Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecalis (EF) aiming for more consistent inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Inoculation treatments were compared to non-inoculated IL10(-/-) and C57 mice, either kept in specific pathogen free (SPF) or conventional conditions (2x5 factorial design). At 12 weeks of age, mice were sacrificed for intestinal histological (HIS) and transcriptomic analysis using limma and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software. Colonic HIS was significantly affected (P<0.05) in inoculated IL10(-/-) mice and accounted for approximately 60% of total intestinal HIS. Inoculation showed a strong effect on colonic gene expression, with more than 2000 genes differentially expressed in EF.CIF-inoculated IL10(-/-) mice. Immune response gene expression was altered (P<0.05) in these mice. The second study investigated the effect of arachidonic (AA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) on colonic HIS and gene expression to test whether EPA, contrary to AA, diminished intestinal inflammation in EF.CIF IL10(-/-) mice (2 x 4 factorial design). AIN-76A (5% corn oil) and AIN-76A (fat-free) +1% corn oil supplemented with either 3.7%  (OA), AA or EPA were used. IL10(-/-) mice fed EPA- and AA-enriched diets had at least 40% lower colonic HIS (P<0.05) than those fed control diets (AIN-76A and OA diets). The expression of immune response and 'inflammatory disease' genes (down-regulated: TNFalpha, IL6, S100A8, FGF7, PTGS2; up-regulated: PPARalpha, MGLL, MYLK, PPSS23, ABCB4 with EPA and/or AA) was affected in IL10(-/-) mice fed EPA- and AA-enriched diets, compared to those fed AIN-76A diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14613754>Linoleic , but not , upregulates the production of interleukin-8 by human intestinal smooth muscle cells isolated from patients with Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease () of unknown etiology. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that dietary fatty acids, linoleic  (LA) and  (OA), could be involved in the inflammatory response through stimulation of the neutrophil chemokine, IL-8.Human intestinal smooth muscle (HISM) cells were isolated from normal patients and patients with Crohn's disease and cultured for 24h with LA or OA in the presence or absence of oxidative stress. The concentrations of IL-8 were measured in the media and cellular oxidative stress was quantitated by measurement of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARSs).Spontaneous production of IL-8 was significantly higher in HISM cells isolated from Crohn's bowel compared to control bowel. LA caused a marked, nine-fold, increase in IL-8 secretion by Crohn's cells, an effect that could be simulated in normal HISM cells by co-incubation of LA with an oxidizing solution (Ox) composed of hypoxanthine+xanthine oxidase+FeSO(4) (OxLA). These effects were inhibited by vitamins C and E. Treatment of Crohn's cells with OxLA did not further increase IL-8 over that of LA alone. The effect of LA alone was not associated with an increase in cellular oxidative stress as quantitated by TBARSs. In contrast to the results with LA, treatment with OA or OxOA did not increase IL-8 in either normal or Crohn's cells. In addition, OA protected Crohn's cells from the increase in TBARSs induced by Ox. In contrast to IL-8, spontaneous production of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) was significantly lower in Crohn's HISM cells as compared to normal cells and exposure to OxLA did not increase its production.LA, but not OA, increased the production of IL-8 by HISM cells. These results suggest that replacement of LA by OA in the diet of Crohn's patients and increased intake of a diet rich in antioxidants could be beneficial in decreasing inflammatory activity in Crohn's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240835>Correlation of diet, microbiota and metabolite networks in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Microbiota dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel disease () has been widely reported. The gut microbiota connect diet to the metabolism by producing small molecules via diverse metabolic pathways. In this study we aimed to investigate the dietary preferences of  patients, and to explore the interactions among gut microbiota composition, dietary components, and metabolites in relation to .Dietary preferences of  patients (including those with ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]) and health controls were investigated, and their gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analyses of fecal and biopsy samples. The metabolite profiles of the samples were then analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses.The daily intake of folic , niacin, vitamins C and D, calcium, and selenium differed significantly between patients with  and healthy controls. A decrease in long-chain (such as arachidic, and ) and medium-chain fatty acids (sebacic  and isocaproic ) as well as bile  was observed in patients with . Compared with healthy controls, 22 microbial species (including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and Clostridium clostridioforme CAG132) in the UC group and 37 microbial species (such as Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in the CD group were found to be correlated to diet and metabolites.

We sought to investigate serum fatty  composition in CD, and associations of fatty acids with disease activity, cytokines, and adipokines. Serum was prospectively collected from 116 CD subjects and 27 non- controls. Clinical disease activity was assessed by the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Serum fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography. Serum cytokines and adipokines were measured by Luminex assay. Dietary histories were obtained from a subset of patients. Nine serum cytokines and adipokines were increased in CD versus controls. CD subjects had increased percentage serum monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), dihomo-gamma linolenic  (DGLA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and , but decreased arachidonic  (AA) versus controls. The % total n-3 fatty acids and % EPA directly correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and HBI, whereas the % total n-6 fatty acids were inversely correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and HBI. CD subjects had increased caloric intake versus controls, but no alterations in total fat or PUFA intake. We found differences in serum fatty acids, most notably PUFA, in CD that correlated both with clinical disease activity and inflammatory cytokines. Our findings indicate that altered fatty  metabolism or utilization is present in CD and is related to disease activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530133>Experimental colitis in mice is attenuated by changes in the levels of endocannabinoid metabolites induced by selective inhibition of fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH).</a></h2><p>Pharmacological treatment and/or maintenance of remission in inflammatory bowel diseases () is currently one of the biggest challenge in the field of gastroenterology. Available therapies are mostly limited to overcoming the symptoms, but not the cause of the disease. Recently, the endocannabinoid system has been proposed as a novel target in the treatment of . Here we aimed to assess the anti-inflammatory action of the novel fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor PF-3845 and its effect on the endocannabinoid and related lipid metabolism during the course of experimental colitis.We used two models of experimental colitis in mice (TNBS- and DSS-induced) and additionally, we employed LC/MS/MS spectrometry to determine the changes in biolipid levels in the mouse colon during inflammation.We showed that the FAAH inhibitor PF-3845 reduced experimental TNBS-induced colitis in mice and its anti-inflammatory action is associated with altering the levels of selected biolipids (arachidonic and  derivatives, prostaglandins and biolipids containing glycine in the mouse colon).We show that FAAH is a promising pharmacological target and the FAAH-dependent biolipids play a major role in colitis. Our results highlight and promote therapeutic strategy based on targeting FAAH-dependent metabolic pathways in order to alleviate intestinal inflammation.Copyright © 2014 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation.

We recently reported that PLA2 mediates hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysophosphatidylcholine (L-PC) when both are applied to the apical surface of cultured EC monolayers, resulting in increased bacterial translocation (BT) and decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Free fatty acids (FFA) are the other products of this reaction, however, their effect on Caco-2 cell permeability has not been reported. In addition to PC, other luminal phospholipids are present at the surface of the enterocyte. PLA2 may also mediate the hydrolysis of luminal phospholipids other than PC. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of phospholipids other than PC and common FFA on intestinal epithelial permeability and BT. Human Caco-2 enterocytes were grown to confluence on porous filters in the apical chamber of a two-chamber cell-culture system. Monolayer integrity and tight-junction permeability were measured as TEER. First, common FFA released by PC hydrolysis were determined using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). In separate experiments, monolayers were treated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (L-PE), or palmitoleic ,  acids, linoleic acids, and arachidonic  solubilized in solution with PC. The magnitude of BT was determined 2 h after treatment by adding Escherichia coli C25 to the apical chamber followed by quantitatively culturing basal-chamber samples. Statistical analysis was by the Kurosaki-Wallis test. TLC of PC samples incubated with PLA2 on the apical surface of Caco-2 monolayers demonstrated the production of palmitoleic ,  acids, linoleic acids, and arachidonic . L-PE significantly decreased TEER compared to controls, but to a lesser degree than L-PC alone. L-PE had no effects on BT. Palmitoleic  and  likewise significantly decreased TEER compared to controls, however, less than L-PC. All FFA tested had no effect on BT. Phospholipids applied to the apical surface of enterocytes, such as those found in vivo in mucus, can be hydrolyzed by the enzyme PLA2 resulting in lysophospholipid and FFA species that can alter enterocyte monolayer permeability. However, FFA and L-PL, other than L-PC, appear to have no effect to stimulate BT. This observation may have clinical implications in the pathogenesis and treatment strategies for  patients in whom enterocyte PLA2 activity has been shown to be elevated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526351>Docosahexaenoyl serotonin emerges as most potent inhibitor of IL-17 and CCL-20 released by blood mononuclear cells from a series of N-acyl serotonins identified in human intestinal tissue.</a></h2><p>Fatty  amides (FAAs), conjugates of fatty acids with ethanolamine, mono-amine neurotransmitters or amino acids are a class of molecules that display diverse functional roles in different cells and tissues. Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty  conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty  conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic  (PA-5-HT), stearic  (SA-5-HT) and  (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response. Our findings may be of relevance in relation to intestinal inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2017.

Moreover, colonic arachidonic  (ARA) proportions are increased and  (OA) proportions are decreased. Fish oils are protective in  patients however, a side-by-side comparison between effects of fish oils, ARA and OA has not been made. We therefore, compared effects of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) versus ARA and OA on ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 enterocytes. To validate our model we showed that dexamethasone, sulfasalazine and PPARalpha (GW7647) or PPARgamma (troglitazone) agonists significantly lowered ICAM-1 expression. ICAM-1 expression of non-stimulated and cytokine stimulated Caco-2 cells cultured for 22 days with ARA was significant higher as compared to EPA and OA. Furthermore, ARA increased NF-kappaB activation in a reporter cell-line as compared to EPA. Antibody array analysis of multiple inflammatory proteins particularly showed an increased monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and angiogenin production and a decreased interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 production by ARA as compared to EPA. Our results showed that ARA but not EPA and OA activates NF-kappaB and elevates ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 enterocytes. It suggests that replacement of ARA by EPA or OA in the colon mucosa might have beneficial effects for  patients. Finally, we suggest that the pro-inflammatory effects of ARA versus EPA and OA are not related to PPARgamma activation and/or eicosanoid formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30378628>The protective effects of Poria cocos-derived polysaccharide CMP33 against  in mice and its molecular mechanism.</a></h2><p>In this study, the protective effects of a carboxymethyl polysaccharide CMP33 from Poria cocos against inflammatory bowel disease () were investigated using TNBS-induced colitis in mice. The results showed that CMP33 markedly ameliorated the severity of colitis, including a 2-fold decrease in the mortality rate, a 50% decrease in disease activity index, and a 36%-44% decrease in macro- or microscopic histopathological score, compared with TNBS administration. Moreover, CMP33 decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines in the colon tissue and serum of colitic mice. Using iTRAQ-coupled- nano-HPLC-MS/MS-based proteomics, the protein profiles after TNBS, high- or low-dose CMP33 and salazosulfapyridine (SASP) treatments were compared and many differentially expressed proteins were identified. Among them, 7 proteins (Hmgcs2, Fabp2, Hp, B4galnt2, B3gnt6, Sap and Ca1) were proposed to be the common targeting protein group (TPG) of CMP33 and drug SASP. Particularly, some targeting proteins were CMP33-dose-specific: high-dose-specific TPG (Mtco3, Gal-6, Mptx, S100 g and Hpx) and low-dose-specific TPG (Zg16, Hexb, Insl5, Cept1, Hspb6 and Ifi27l2b), suggesting the complex acting mechanism of CMP33. GC-TOF-MS-based metabolomics revealed that  and dihydrotestosterone could be the common targets of CMP33 and SASP. By integrative analysis of proteomics and metabolomics, key protein-metabolite pathways (PMP) were identified, PMP for high-dose: 2-hydroxybutyric  - (GPT, GGH) - glutathione - ALB - testosterone - TTR - dihydrotestosterone; PMP for low-dose: (PYY, FABP2, HMGCS2) -  - TTR - dihydrotestosterone. In total, these results demonstrated the protective effects of CMP33 against  in mice through the potential TPG and PMP.</p></html>
