The comparative efficacy of various bariatric procedures for the remission of type 2  has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to compare the effects of the two most common bariatric procedures, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, on remission of  and β-cell function.We conducted a single-centre, triple-blind, randomised trial at Vestfold Hospital Trust (Tønsberg, Norway), in which patients (aged ≥18 years) with type 2  and obesity were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy (the Oseberg study). Randomisation was performed with a computerised random number generator and a block size of 10. Treatment allocation was masked from participants, study personnel, and outcome assessors and was concealed with sealed opaque envelopes. Surgeons used identical skin incisions during both surgeries and were not involved in patient follow-up. The primary clinical outcome was the proportion of participants with complete remission of type 2  (HbA of ≤6·0% [42 mmol/mol] without the use of glucose-lowering medication) at 1 year after surgery. The primary physiological outcome was disposition index (a measure of β-cell function) at 1 year after surgery, as assessed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Primary outcomes were analysed in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. This trial is ongoing and closed to recruitment, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, .Between Oct 15, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017, 1305 patients who were preparing for bariatric surgery were screened, of whom 319 consecutive patients with type 2  were assessed for eligibility. 109 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to gastric bypass (n=54) or sleeve gastrectomy (n=55). 107 (98%) of 109 patients completed 1-year follow-up, with one patient in each group withdrawing after surgery (per-protocol population). In the intention-to-treat population,  remission rates were higher in the gastric bypass group than in the sleeve gastrectomy group (risk difference 27% [95% CI 10 to 44]; relative risk [RR] 1·57 [1·14 to 2·16], p=0·0054); results were similar in the per-protocol population (risk difference 27% [95% CI 10 to 45]; RR 1·57 [1·14 to 2·15], p=0·0036). In the intention-to-treat population, disposition index increased in both groups (between-group difference 55 [-111 to 220], p=0·52); results were similar in the per-protocol population (between-group difference 21 [-214 to 256], p=0.86). In the gastric bypass group, ten of 54 participants had early complications and 17 of 53 had late side-effects. In the sleeve gastrectomy group, eight of 55 participants had early complications and 22 of 54 had late side-effects. No deaths occurred in either group.Gastric bypass was found to be superior to sleeve gastrectomy for remission of type 2  at 1 year after surgery, and the two procedures had a similar beneficial effect on β-cell function. The use of gastric bypass as the preferred bariatric procedure for patients with obesity and type 2  could improve  care and reduce related societal costs.Morbid Obesity Centre, Vestfold Hospital Trust.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We established a multidisciplinary metabolic hepatology clinic in 2014 and have analysed the clinical data to evaluate the effectiveness of this service. Patients with NAFLD (n=165) who had attended two or more appointments were included. Prespecified clinical data were collected prospectively at clinic appointments and analysed retrospectively. Interventions offered included lifestyle advice, signposting to weight loss services and pharmacological treatment of  and cardiovascular risk factors. Median follow-up was 13 months (range: 2-34). 59% (n=97) of patients had type 2  (T2DM). 53% (n=87) underwent liver biopsy of whom 18% (n=16) had cirrhosis. Median alanine aminotransferase (ALT) reduced by 11 IU/L (p<0.0001), median weight reduced by 3.3 kg (p=0.0005). There were significant reductions in HbA1c, total cholesterol and liver stiffness. Specifically, in patients with T2DM, HbA1c decreased by 4 mmol/mol (p=0.01) with significant reductions in ALT, weight and total cholesterol. Relative cardiovascular risk assessed by the QRISK3 score reduced in the whole cohort and in those with T2DM. Health economic modelling suggested the clinic intervention among those patients with poorly controlled T2DM was cost-effective. In conclusion, a multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with NAFLD in this observational cohort study was associated with improvements in liver-related and cardio-metabolic related health parameters and with evidence of cost-effectiveness in patients with poorly controlled T2DM.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

While most resolve with immersion in warm water, a few become infected and require antibiotics. We present a case report of a presumptive stingray injury that evolved to a major slough and which required prolonged healing in a patient with . Our literature review was unable to find a similarly reported case.A co-author was asked to evaluate and manage an ominous-appearing wound on the right foot of a diabetic. The problem developed after the individual had been wading in shallow ocean beach water. The patient's diabetic sensory neuropathy obscured the immediate association of the problem with a stingray injury, but this became the presumptive diagnosis when pain developed and necessitated that he seek medical care.After an initial urgent care visit, increasing pain and worsening appearance of the patient's foot necessitated a visit to our emergency department. The patient was admitted the next day due to symptoms of systemic sepsis. On the fourth hospital day, a large bulla on the lateral side of the right foot was excised. This unroofed a full-thickness slough to the periosteum level of the underlying bones. Not until the 16th hospital day had enough improvement occurred to discharge the patient. Over the next 16 weeks, the wound improved, developed a vascular base and epithelialized.With a dearth of literature about stingray injuries in patients with  reported, our case is unique: The patient's wound course more closely resembled a toxic inoculation than the typical puncture wound-cellulitis presentations associated with stingray injuries.Copyright© Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681969>Magnetic resonance imaging and symptoms in patients with neurosarcoidosis and central .</a></h1><p>In the clinical setting, the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis in patients with central  (CDI) is typically based both on symptoms (i.e. polydipsia or polyuria) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings (e.g. pituitary abnormality). However, inconsistent changes in the patient's symptoms and brain MRI findings may occur during the clinical course of the disease. This review was performed to summarise the relationship between symptoms and brain MRI findings in previously reported cases of neurosarcoidosis with CDI.Case studies of patients diagnosed with neurosarcoidosis with CDI were collected via a PubMed search of studies published through 30 June 2018.Thirteen eligible studies were reviewed (20 patients; 12 men, 8 women; mean age 33 years). Polydipsia or polyuria was the first symptom in 13 patients. The mean duration from disease onset to diagnosis was 3.4 months. Brain MRIs showed abnormal findings in the hypothalamus and pituitary for 17 patients. Immunosuppressive drugs were used in 17 patients. For 14 patients, MRI findings improved, while symptoms did not.Patients with both neurosarcoidosis and CDI symptoms often do not improve, despite the fact that brain MRI findings often improve following treatment.

Health professionals, however, often fail to realize empowerment in clinical practice, especially in patients with poorly controlled type 2 .To evaluate the effectiveness of an empowerment-based intervention on empowerment level, psychological distress, and quality of life among patients with poorly controlled type 2 .An analysis of secondary outcomes of a prospective multi-center, randomized, parallel, investigator-blinded controlled trial.A total of 242 adults patients with poorly controlled type 2  [Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)≥ 58 mmol/mol in the recent six months] were randomly allocated to either intervention (n = 121) or attentional control (n = 121) groups. The design of the intervention was based on the Empowerment Process Model. The intervention group received a 6-week empowerment-based transitional care program, with significant emphasis on establishing personally meaningful goals, facilitating collaborative partnership and shared decision-making, resolving life-disease conflicts via situational reflection. Participants in the attentional control group received two general health education classes and post-discharge social calls on top of routine care. Outcomes of interest include empowerment level,  distress, and quality of life. Participants were invited to complete a set of questionnaires before randomization, one-week, and three-month post-intervention. Statistical analyses were performed using the generalized estimating equations based on the intention-to-treat principle.Comparing with the attention control group, participants in the intervention group showed significant improvements on empowerment level [(β= 0.163; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.011 to 0.316, p = 0.036) at one-week post-intervention and (β= 0.176; 95% CI: 0.020 to 0.331, p = 0.027) at three-month post-intervention, respectively]. This group of patients also displayed significant reduction in terms of emotional-distress (β= -0.424, 95% CI: -0.798 to -0.049, p = 0.027) and regimen-distress (β= -0.397, 95% CI: -0.702 to -0.091, p = 0.011) at three-month post-intervention and physician-related distress (β= -0.236, 95% CI: -0.466 to -0.006, p = 0.044) at one-week post-intervention. Significant improvement in quality of life (β= 4.151, 95% CI: 1.291, 7.012, p = 0.004) at three-month post-intervention was also observed in the intervention group.Findings provide empirical evidence for the values of an empowerment-based intervention program for patients with poorly controlled type 2  in increasing the empowerment level and perceived quality of life and reducing  distress. Long-term effects of the intervention and its underlying mechanisms need further investigation.Copyright © 2019.

Because the production and fate of stem cells are often modulated by cellular redox and metabolic homeostasis, important roles of Nrf2 have emerged in the regulation of stem cell quiescence, survival, self-renewal, proliferation, senescence, and differentiation. In a rapidly advancing field, this review summarizes Nrf2 signaling in the context of stem cell state and function and provides a rationale for Nrf2 as a therapeutic target in stem cell-based regenerative medicine.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we evaluated the myocardial and PBMCs GRK2 levels in early diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM).C57BL/KS-db/db male diabetic mice at 12 weeks of age, as the type 2  (T2DM) animal model of early DCM were evaluated. Forty-four T2DM patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), without evidence of hypertension, coronary artery diseases, congestive heart failure, and diabetic complications and without evidence of ischemia in a maximal treadmill exercise test, were recruited as the DM + LVDD group; 30 age-matched T2DM patients without LVDD were recruited as the DM control group. Left ventricular diastolic function was evaluated by cardiac tissue Doppler. The pseudonormal pattern of ventricular filling and E'/A' < 1 were regarded as LVDD.Compared to 8-week-old diabetic mice and 12-week-old control mice, GRK2-mRNA level and expression in myocardial tissues of 12-week-old diabetic mice were significantly increased, as well as the left ventricular wall thickness and systolic function. And the collagen volume fraction (CVF), collagen-3 expression, P53 expression, and cell apoptotic rate in the myocardium of 12-week-old diabetic mice elevated as well. The GRK2-mRNA level in PBMCs of DM with LVDD was significantly higher than in DM control without LVDD.GRK2 expression increased in the myocardial tissue and the PBMCs at the early stage of DCM. These data support further research on the role of GRK2 as the clinical biomarker for early DCM.The GRK2 level elevated not only in the myocardium of diabetic mice with early stage of diabetic cardiomyopathy but also in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of type 2 diabetic patients with the early stage of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The study findings suggested that the GRK2 was a potential biomarker for early diabetic cardiomyopathy.© 2019 The Authors.

The objective of this paper is to review the genetic inheritance, the clinical manifestations and the treatment of patients with MIDD.The current review used a literature search of scientific papers on this rare syndrome.MtDNA is primarily inherited through the maternal oocyte, therefore the genetic abnormalities in MIDD are associated with maternal inheritance. Mitochondria contain circular mtDNA which codes for various mitochondrial genes. The mtDNA can be heteroplasmic, containing more than one type of mtDNA sequence; if one of the mtDNAs contains the mt3243A>G mutation, a patient may develop MIDD. Patients can inherit different amounts of mutated mtDNA and normal mtDNA that effect the severity of the clinical manifestations of MIDD. The most common clinical manifestations include  (DM), deafness, ophthalmic disease, cardiac disease, renal disease, gastrointestinal disease, short stature, and myopathies. In order to effectively treat patients with MIDD it is important to recognize the underlying pathophysiology of this specific form of  and the pathophysiology associated with the organ-specific complications present in this disease.The heteroplasmic inheritance of mutated mtDNA play an important role in the clinical manifestations of various mitochondrial diseases, specifically MIDD. This review will alert endocrinologists of the signs and symptoms of MIDD patients and important clinical considerations when managing this disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681015>Transcription Factor Elf3 Modulates Vasopressin-Induced Aquaporin-2 Gene Expression in Kidney Collecting Duct Cells.</a></h1><p>Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is a molecular water channel protein responsible for water reabsorption by the kidney collecting ducts. Many water balance disorders are associated with defects in AQP2 gene expression regulated by the peptide hormone vasopressin. Here, we studied roles of Elf3 (E26 transformation-specific (Ets)-related transcription factor 3) in AQP2 gene expression in the collecting duct cells (mpkCCD). Vasopressin increased AQP2 mRNA and protein levels without affecting AQP2 mRNA degradation, indicative of transcriptional regulation. Elf3 knockdown and overexpression, respectively, reduced and increased AQP2 gene expression under basal and vasopressin-stimulated conditions. However, the vasopressin-to-basal ratios of AQP2 gene expression levels remained constant, indicating that Elf3 does not directly mediate vasopressin response but modulates the level of AQP2 gene expression inducible by vasopressin. The Elf3-modulated AQP2 gene expression was associated with AQP2 promoter activity, in line with Elf3's ability to bind an Ets element in the AQP2 promoter. Mutation in the Ets element reduced both basal and vasopressin-stimulated AQP2 promoter activity, again without affecting vasopressin-to-basal ratios of the AQP2 promoter activity. Lithium chloride reduced both Elf3 and AQP2 mRNA in the mpkCCD cells as well as in mouse kidney inner medulla. We conclude that Elf3 modulates AQP2 promoter activity thereby gauging vasopressin-inducible AQP2 gene expression levels. Our data provide a potential explanation to lithium-induced nephrogenic  where lithium reduces Elf3 and hence AQP2 abundance.Copyright © 2019 Lin, Ma, Kuo, Su, Wang, Chan, Su, Weng, Yang, Lin and Yu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680069>Need of statins among un-diagnosed unaware Pakistanis via revised pool cohort equation by American heart association.</a></h1><p>National diseases burden of Cardiovascular diseases is the top leading cause of death in Pakistan.

Retinal neovascularization can lead to vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment, yet the pathological process of neovascularization is a complex phenomenon under active investigation. Understanding and monitoring retinal neovascularization is critically important in clinical ophthalmology. This study describes a novel multimodal ocular imaging system which combines photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and a spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to improve the visualization of retinal neovascularization (RNV), their depth, and the surrounding anatomy in living rabbits. RNV was induced in New Zealand rabbits by intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The retinal vasculature before and after injection at various times was monitored and evaluated using multimodal imaging including color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography (FA), OCT, and PAM. In vivo experiments demonstrate that PAM imaging distinctly characterized the location as well as the morphology of individual RNV with high contrast at a safe laser energy of 80 nJ. SD-OCT was used to identify a cross-sectional structure of RNV. In addition, dynamic changes in the retinal morphology and retinal neovascularization were observed at day 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 28, and day 35 after VEGF injection. PAM demonstrated high-resolution optical absorption of hemoglobin and vascular imaging of the retina and choroid with increased depth of penetration. With the current multimodal imaging system, RNV can be easily visualized in both 2D and 3D angiography. This multimodal ocular imaging system provides improved characterization of the microvasculature in a safe manner in larger rabbit eyes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679627>Clinical Practice Variations in the Management of Stress-Induced Cardiomyopathy: A Canadian Perspective.</a></h1><p>Despite increased recognition of stress-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC), there are no randomized controlled trials or established guidelines to direct therapeutic strategies and little is known about the local experience in Canada. The objective of this study was to better understand the clinical practice variations in the management of SIC across Canada. By using an online platform, a series of questions were distributed to practicing cardiologists between October and November 2018. In total, 172 cardiologists completed the survey. Although many cardiologists have managed patients with SIC, more than two-thirds do not adhere to any guidelines or references. Of those who do, the top referenced resources included expert consensus statements from the American College of Cardiology, the European Society of Cardiology, general heart failure guidelines, and UpToDate. Regarding investigations, most participants routinely order TTEs and coronary angiograms, and a minority would order pheochromocytoma workup. Common medications prescribed for hemodynamically stable patients include β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antiplatelet agents, and anticoagulation. Some 3% of participants reported not prescribing any cardiac medications. Most respondents follow up with patients with SIC within a 3-month period. The risk factors most believed to be associated with SIC included female gender, anxiety, older age, ethnicity, and . No participants believed that male gender was a risk factor. Many participants believed there needs to be improvements made, such as a Canadian guideline, a Canadian registry, or dedicated workshops at the national cardiology conference. This study demonstrates ongoing variability in the clinical management of SIC across Canada and illustrates a potential area for further research.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

Thus, it is timely to gather together the studies that have characterized and explored the mechanisms associated with the hypertension to take stock of exactly what is known and what remains to be determined. Growing evidence supports the notion that the mechanism of hypertension in BPH/2 mice is predominantly neurogenic with some of the early studies showing aberrant brain noradrenaline levels in BPH/2 compared with BPN/3. Analysis of the adrenal gland using microarray suggested an association with the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Indeed, in support of this, there is a larger depressor response to ganglion blockade, which reduced blood pressure in BPH/2 mice to the same level as BPN/3 mice. Greater renal tyrosine hydroxylase staining and greater renal noradrenaline levels in BPH/2 mice suggest sympathetic hyperinnervation of the kidney. Renal denervation markedly reduced the blood pressure in BPH/2 but not BPN/3 mice, confirming the importance of renal sympathetic nervous activity contributing to the hypertension. Further, there is an important contribution to the hypertension from miR-181a and renal renin in this strain. BPH/2 mice also display greater neuronal activity of amygdalo-hypothalamic cardiovascular regulatory regions. Lesions of the medial nucleus of the amygdala reduced the hypertension in BPH/2 mice and abolished the strain difference in the effect of ganglion blockade, suggesting a sympathetic mechanism. Further studies suggest that aberrant GABAergic inhibition may play a role since BPH/2 mice have low GABA receptor δ, α4 and β2 subunit mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, which are predominantly involved in promoting tonic neuronal inhibition. Allopregnanolone, an allosteric modulator of GABA receptors, which increase the expression of these subunits in the amygdala and hypothalamus, is shown to reduce the hypertension and sympathetic nervous system contribution in BPH/2 mice. Thus far, evidence suggests that BPH/2 mice have aberrant GABAergic inhibition, which drives neuronal overactivity within amygdalo-hypothalamic brain regions. This overactivity is responsible for the greater sympathetic contribution to the hypertension in BPH/2 mice, thus making this an ideal model of neurogenic hypertension.Copyright © 2019 Jackson, Head, Gueguen, Stevenson, Lim and Marques.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680453>Inhibition of miR-21 alleviated cardiac perivascular fibrosis via repressing EndMT in T1DM.</a></h1><p>In type 1 and type 2 , increased cardiac fibrosis, stiffness and associated diastolic dysfunction may be the earliest pathological phenomena in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in endothelia cells (ECs) is a critical cellular phenomenon that increases cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and cardiac fibrosis in diabetic hearts. The purpose of this paper is to explore the molecular mechanism of miR-21 regulating EndMT and cardiac perivascular fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy. In vivo, hyperglycaemia up-regulated the mRNA level of miR-21, aggravated cardiac dysfunction and collagen deposition. The condition was recovered by inhibition of miR-21 following with improving cardiac function and decreasing collagen deposition. miR-21 inhibition decreased cardiac perivascular fibrosis by suppressing EndMT and up-regulating SMAD7 whereas activating p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3. In vitro, high glucose (HG) up-regulated miR-21 and induced EndMT in ECs, which was decreased by inhibition of miR-21. A highly conserved binding site of NF-κB located in miR-21 5'-UTR was identified. In ECs, SMAD7 is directly regulated by miR-21. In conclusion, the pathway of NF-κB/miR-21/SMAD7 regulated the process of EndMT in T1DM, in diabetic cardiomyopathy, which may be regarded as a potential clinical therapeutic target for cardiac perivascular fibrosis.© 2019 The Authors.

Primary care staff delivered the DPP curriculum, and lifestyle coaches provided monthly direction to achieve weight loss. For this substudy, barriers to weight loss and physical activity described by participants, as well as approaches coaches used to address them, were gathered. Groupings of barriers (DPP defined) were analyzed in relation to demographic characteristics and compared to data from the DPP sample.Top weight loss barriers were problems with self-monitoring, too little physical activity, internal thought/mood cues, vacation/holidays, and social cues. Percentages reporting a barrier were much higher in SHINE. Top physical activity barriers were problems with self-monitoring, access/weather, time management, aches/pains, and vacation/holidays. These did not correspond closely to DPP data. Coaches used problem solving, self-monitoring skills review, increased physical activity, and motivational strategies. SHINE coaches were more likely than DPP coaches to use alternative approaches.Barriers to weight loss and physical activity in a community sample of persons at risk for  occurred at much higher rates than in the highly screened DPP sample.

The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of MetS and its associated risk factors among adult Palestinians using the International  Federation definition.A total of 1348 subjects ages 18-65 y were recruited in a cross-sectional study that was conducted in 2018-2019 in the northern West Bank.A total of 1082 subjects participated; 51.7% were men. The prevalence of MetS was high (44.9%), and higher among women (46.1%) than men (44.2%) (p<0.001). The prevalence increased significantly with increasing age and body mass index (BMI) in both genders (p<0.001). However, metabolically obese but normal weight individuals (MONW) (8.4%) were also identified, with a slight increase among women (9.4%) compared with men (7.5%) (p=0.56). MetS was more likely to be prevalent among participants with increased fasting blood sugar (5.8 times), increased triglyceride (7.4 times), increased blood pressure (4.5 times) and BMI ≥25 (19.9 times) (p<0.001). The prevalence of MetS was higher among rural (50.3%) vs urban (39.3%) residents and refugees (33.8%).With increasing age and obesity, clustering of MetS components increased remarkably in both genders. Effective prevention and treatment strategies for MetS and its risk factors should be developed targeting different ages and genders.© The Author(s) 2019.

Of 3,706 participants with T2DM, 2126 (57%) had known T2DM, 118 (3%) were identified by isolated elevated fasting glucose, 1022 (28%) had isolated elevated post-load glucose, and 440 (12%) had both elevated fasting and post-load glucose. Compared to normoglycaemia, the HR (95% CI) of all-cause mortality was 1.71 (1.46, 2.00), 0.96 (0.47, 1.93), 1.43 (1.15-1.78) and 1.82 (1.35-2.45) for the four groups above, respectively. T2DM defined by elevated HbA1c was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.17, 95% 0.81-1.69).Individuals with isolated higher 2h post-load glucose had a higher risk of mortality by 43% than those with normoglycaemia.

Incorporating GMVs with intensive dietary change could enable weight loss and improve glycemia while decreasing medication intensity.To examine whether a program of GMVs combined with intensive weight management (WM) is noninferior to GMVs alone for change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level at 48 weeks (prespecified margin of 0.5%) and superior to GMVs alone for hypoglycemic events,  medication intensity, and weight loss.This randomized clinical trial identified via the electronic medical record 2814 outpatients with type 2 , uncontrolled HbA1c, and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 27 or higher from Veterans Affairs Medical Center clinics in Durham and Greenville, North Carolina. Between January 12, 2015, and May 30, 2017, 263 outpatients started the intervention.Participants randomized to the GMV group (n = 136) received counseling about -related topics with medication optimization every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, then every 8 weeks (9 visits). Participants randomized to the WM/GMV group (n = 127) received low-carbohydrate diet counseling with baseline medication reduction and subsequent medication optimization every 2 weeks for 16 weeks followed by an abbreviated GMV intervention every 8 weeks (13 visits).Outcomes included HbA1c level, hypoglycemic events,  medication effect score, and weight at 48 weeks analyzed using hierarchical generalized mixed models to account for clustering within group sessions.Among 263 participants (mean [SD] age, 60.7 [8.2] years; 235 [89.4%] men; 143 [54.4%] black), baseline HbA1c level was 9.1% (1.3%) and BMI was 35.3 (5.1). At 48 weeks, HbA1c level was improved in both study arms (8.2% in the WM/GMV arm and 8.3% in the GMV arm; mean difference, -0.1%; 95% CI, -0.5% to 0.2%; upper 95% CI, <0.5% threshold; P = .44). The WM/GMV arm had lower  medication use (mean difference in medication effect score, -0.5; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.3; P < .001) and greater weight loss (mean difference, -3.7 kg; 95% CI, -5.5 to -1.9 kg; P < .001) than did the GMV arm at 48 weeks and approximately 50% fewer hypoglycemic events (incidence rate ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.71; P < .001) during the 48-week period.In GMVs for , addition of WM using a low-carbohydrate diet was noninferior for lowering HbA1c levels compared with conventional medication management and showed advantages in other clinically important outcomes.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679424>Thiazide Use and Cardiovascular Events in Type 2 Diabetic Patients With Well-Controlled Blood Pressure.</a></h1><p>Evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of thiazides in patients with well-controlled and relatively low blood pressure (BP) is lacking. This study aimed to assess whether thiazide use is effective and safe in type 2 diabetic patients with well-controlled BP and whether intensive BP control leads to decreased risk of cardiovascular events depending on thiazide use. We performed an observational cohort study using data from the ACCORD study (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in ). The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which was a composite end point including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Hazard ratios for primary and secondary outcomes with 95% CIs were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. We included 10 011 type 2 diabetic patients. The overall mean follow-up period was 7.7 years, and 1776 patients experienced MACE. Mean systolic BP at baseline in patients taking and not taking thiazides was 137.2 and 135.7 mm Hg, respectively. Thiazide use was associated with increased risk of MACE, particularly stroke (hazard ratio, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.18-1.88]). In addition, thiazide use was significantly associated with higher risks of MACE and stroke in patients receiving intensive BP control but not in those receiving standard BP control. Similar associations were observed in analyses using propensity score matching. Intensive BP control reduced the risks of MACE and stroke in patients not taking thiazides but not in patients taking thiazides.

However, little consideration is given as to whether different domains of PA have differing associations with health outcomes. We sought to determine the association between occupational, sport, leisure, and total PA with baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), distinguishing between neural (nBRS) and mechanical (mBRS) BRS. In a cross-sectional analysis of 8649 adults aged 50 to 75 years, resting nBRS (estimated by low-frequency gain, from carotid distension rate and heart rate) and mBRS (carotid stiffness) were measured by high-precision carotid echo-tracking. PA was self-reported using the validated Baecke questionnaire. The associations between PA and nBRS and mBRS were quantified using multivariate linear regression analysis, separately in the working and nonworking population. In working adults (n=5039), occupational PA was associated with worse nBRS (unstandardized β=-0.02; [95% CI, -0.04 to -0.003]; =0.022) whereas sport PA was associated with better nBRS (β=0.04; [95% CI, 0.02-0.07]; =0.003) and mBRS (β=-0.05; [95% CI, -0.09 to -0.00001]; =0.049).

The goal of this case-control study was to identify circulating miRNAs for the diagnosis of DR. The miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit was used to extract serum miRNAs. The μParaflo™ MicroRNA microarray was used to detect the expression levels of the miRNAs. The miRWalk algorithm was applied to predict the target genes of the miRNAs, which were further confirmed by the dual luciferase reporter gene system in HEK293T cells. A microarray was performed between 5 DR cases and 5 age-, sex-, body mass index-, and duration of -matched type 2 diabetic (T2DM) controls. The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique was used to validate the differentially expressed circulating miRNAs in 45 DR cases and 45 well-matched controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the circulating miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for DR. Our microarray analysis screened out miR-2116-5p and miR-3197 as significantly up-regulated in DR cases compared with the controls. Furthermore, two miRNAs were validated in the 45 DR cases and 45 controls. The ROC analysis suggested that both miR-3197 and miR-2116-5p distinguished DR cases from controls. An additional dual-luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that notch homolog 2 (NOTCH2) was the target gene of miR-2116-5p.

Although diabetic polyneuropathy is the most important risk factor in cases of diabetic foot, given its poor prognosis, the criteria for diagnosis and staging of diabetic polyneuropathy has not been established; consequently, no disease-modifying treatment is available. Most criteria and scoring systems which were previously proposed consist of clinical signs, symptoms, and quantitative examinations including sensory function tests and nerve conduction study. However, in diabetic polyneuropathy, clinical symptoms, including numbness, pain, and allodynia, demonstrate no significant correlation with the development of pathophysiological changes in the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, these proposed criteria and scoring systems have failed to become a universal clinical endpoint for large-scale clinical trials evaluating the prognosis in diabetic patients. We should use quantitative examinations of which validity has been proven. Nerve conduction study, for example, has been proven effective to evaluate dysfunctions of large nerve fibers. Baba's classification, which uses a nerve conduction study, is one of the most promising diagnostic methods. Loss of small nerve fibers can be determined using corneal confocal microscopy and intraepidermal nerve fiber density. However, no staging criteria have been proposed using these quantitative evaluations for small fiber neuropathy. To establish a novel diagnostic and staging criteria of diabetic polyneuropathy, we propose three principles to be considered: (1) include only generalizable objective quantitative tests, (2) exclude clinical symptoms and signs, (3) do not restrictively exclude other causes of polyneuropathy.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the pathways or potential effects of apoptosis in AGEs-treated HPDLCs have not been fully elucidated. Autophagy is closely related to apoptosis. Herein, we investigated the potential mechanism of apoptosis and autophagy in HPDLCs treated with AGEs via an in vitro model. We found that AGEs-treated HPDLCs showed a time- and concentration-dependent reduction in the cell survival rate. The mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis was induced in AGEs-treated HPDLCs, as confirmed by the mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, decreased Bcl-2 expression, increased Bax expression, and increased caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Autophagy was also induced in AGEs-treated HPDLCs, as indicated by the conversion of LC3-II/LC3-I and the presence of autophagosomes. Interestingly, our study results suggested that apoptosis and autophagy were related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In addition, AGEs-induced autophagy acted as a latent factor in decreasing the generation of ROS in HPDLCs and protecting against the AGEs-induced apoptosis. In summary, our study shows that ROS are essential in AGEs-induced HPDLCs apoptosis and autophagy, which may be a molecular mechanism for the repairment of ROS-induced damage in HPDLCs treated with AGEs to promote cell survival.

Recent evidence has accumulated for roles of diet and the gut microbiome as environmental factors in blood pressure regulation. However, this is complex because gut microbiomes are a unique feature of each individual reflecting that individual's developmental and environmental history creating caveats for both experimental models and human studies. Here, we describe guidelines for conducting gut microbiome studies in experimental and clinical hypertension. We provide a complete guide for authors on proper design, analyses, and reporting of gut microbiota/microbiome and metabolite studies and checklists that can be used by reviewers and editors to support robust reporting and interpretation. We discuss factors that modulate the gut microbiota in animal (eg, cohort, controls, diet, developmental age, housing, sex, and models used) and human studies (eg, blood pressure measurement and medication, body mass index, demographic characteristics including age, cultural identification, living structure, sex and socioeconomic environment, and exclusion criteria). We also provide best practice advice on sampling, storage of fecal/cecal samples, DNA extraction, sequencing methods (including metagenomics and 16S rRNA), and computational analyses. Finally, we discuss the measurement of short-chain fatty acids, metabolites produced by the gut microbiota, and interpretation of data. These guidelines should support better transparency, reproducibility, and translation of findings in the field of gut microbiota/microbiome in hypertension and cardiovascular disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681173>Treatment of Metabolic Syndrome in Children.</a></h1><p>The Metabolic Syndrome may be tentatively defined as the clustering of several metabolic risk factors in the same individual. A progressively higher number of children and adolescents is affected by this syndrome worldwide, mainly as a consequence of the constant increase of the prevalence of obesity and sedentary habits. As obesity, the chance that the metabolic syndrome traks into adulthood is high. Moreover, the evidence of an association between the duration of the exposition to metabolic risk factors and morbidity and mortality justifies early treatment and prevention of the metabolic syndrome in both children and adolescents. Treatment includes behavioral interventions, adequate nutrition and physical activity, and, if necessary, pharmacological treatments aimed at reducing excessive weight, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose impairments. A multidisciplinary and staged approach to treatment, which includes pediatrician, mental health practitioner, dietician, and nurses, is crucial. Usually, the reduction of fat mass promotes an overall improvement of all the components of the metabolic syndrome. Nevertheless, every single component of the metabolic syndrome should be treated as quickly as possible, by using the best current practice. Drugs may be necessary for treating hypertension, type 2  and dyslipidemia. In selected cases of gross obesity resistant to treatment, surgical therapy may be also performed.Copyright © 2019 Fornari and Maffeis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681167>Diabetic Retinopathy May Indicate an Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Patients With Type 1 -A Nested Case-Control Study in Brazil.</a></h1><p> Cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide, and diabetic retinopathy, the main cause of blindness in economically active populations, share clinical risk factors, and pathophysiological features. The aim of this study is to examine the association between diabetic retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and common risk factors in patients with type 1 .  This nested case-control study was performed in patients from the Brazilian Type 1  Study Group, a nationwide survey that was conducted in Brazil and enrolled 1,760 patients with type 1 . A total of 342 patients were selected (57 cases with macrovascular disease and 285 controls who were matched for duration of  and gender).  In the exploratory analysis, stratified by cardiovascular disease, the following variables were statistically significant: age (=0.037), hypertension (=0.035), high BMI ( = 0.046), diabetic retinopathy ( = 0.003), and chronic kidney disease ( = 0.026). By multivariate logistic regression, patients with diabetic retinopathy were more likely to develop cardiovascular disease (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.16-4.02,  = 0.015). Although to a lesser extent than diabetic retinopathy, higher BMI levels were also related to an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease of 1.08 (95% CI 1.01-1.15,  = 0.024).  The presence of diabetic retinopathy indicates a greater risk for cardiovascular disease in Brazilian patients with type 1 . Further studies are warranted to determine whether a noninvasive exam, such as fundoscopy, could help identify patients who show an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2019 Melo, Morales, Drummond, Santos, Pizarro, Barros, Mattos, Pinheiro, Mallmann, Leal, Muniz, Malerbi and Gomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679812>Effectiveness of group visits for elderly patients with type 2  in an urban community in China.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a group visit intervention in comparison with the usual care for elderly patients with type 2  in a community.

The aim of the study was to determine if this is also true for non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH).  A retrospective, cross-sectional, single-center study design was used. Data were collected on 114 patients (92 female) with NCCAH diagnosed during childhood/adolescence at a tertiary medical center. Patients were classified by treatment status at the last clinic visit. Outcome measures were assessed at diagnosis and the last clinic visit: weight status, body composition, blood pressure, lipid profile, and glucose metabolism. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was compared to the parental prevalence, and for patients aged 11-20 years, to the Israeli National Survey.  Mean age was 7.9 ± 4.2 years at diagnosis and 17.1 ± 6.9 years at the last follow-up. At the last clinic visit, 76 patients were under treatment with glucocorticoids, 27 were off-treatment (previously treated), and 11 had never been treated. The rate of obesity (11.4%) was similar to the parental rates, and the rate of overweight was significantly lower. In patients 11-20 years old, rates of obesity or obesity + overweight were similar to the general Israeli population (11.4 vs. 15.1%,  = 0.24 and 34.2 vs. 41.6%  = 0.18, respectively). No significant difference was found between glucocorticoid-treated and off-treatment patients in any of the metabolic or anthropometric parameters evaluated, except for a lower mean fat mass (% of body weight) in off-treatment patients (23.0 ± 7.7% vs. 27.8 ± 6.8%,  = 0.06). Systolic hypertension was found in 12.2% of NCCAH patients either treated or untreated. : NCCAH diagnosed in childhood, whether treated or untreated, does not pose an increased risk of overweight, obesity, or metabolic derangements in adolescence and early adulthood.Copyright © 2019 de Vries, Lebenthal, Phillip, Shalitin, Tenenbaum and Bello.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682875>GIP's involvement in the pathophysiology of type 2 .</a></h1><p>During the past four decades derangements in glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) biology has been viewed upon as contributing factors to various parts of the pathophysiology type 2 . This overview outlines and discusses the impaired insulin responses to GIP as well as the effect of GIP on glucagon secretion and the potential involvement of GIP in obesity and bone disease associated with type 2 . As outlined in this review, it is unlikely that impaired insulinotropic effects of GIP occur as a primary event in the development of type 2 , but rather develop once the diabetic state is present and beta cells are unable to maintain normoglycemia. In various models, GIP has effects on glucagon secretion, bone and lipid homeostasis, but whether these effects contribute substantially to the pathophysiology of type 2  is at present controversial. The review also discusses the substantial uncertainty surrounding the translation of preclinical data relating to the GIP system and outline future research directions.Copyright © 2019.

Changes in plasma ghrelin levels have been observed following different bariatric surgery procedures, but the results from different studies are contradictory. Much remains unknown regarding the role of ghrelin in the weight loss process following bariatric surgery. Our objective was to describe the behaviour of fasting ghrelin levels, comparing the changes occurring between 2 different surgical techniques (gastric bypass versus vertical sleeve gastrectomy) and their correlation with weight loss.A prospective, observational, analytic cohort study of 54 patients (27 for each surgical technique) with a 12-month follow-up period. We analysed demographic data, anthropometric data, comorbidities, weight loss and evolution of fasting ghrelin.The behaviour of acylated ghrelin was similar with the 2 surgical techniques, with no significant differences between gastric bypass and vertical sleeve gastrectomy. With both procedures, there was an increase in acylated ghrelin on day 5 and a subsequent decrease, and levels then gradually increased to reach values at 12 months that were higher than those reported preoperatively. This increase in ghrelin levels did not affect weight loss, since one year post-surgery, 30% weight loss was achieved with both types of surgery.We observed an increase in fasting acylated ghrelin levels at one year of follow-up with both surgical techniques, with 30% weight loss.Copyright © 2019 SEEN y SED.

AChIR was measured in vitro in aortic rings, with/without L-NAME, MS-PPOH, HET0016 or indomethacin. mRNA expression of eNOS, iNOS, COX-1, COX-2, thromboxane A synthase 1 (TBXAS1), CYP4A1, CYP4A3 and CYP2J3 was assessed by qPCR. Systemic oxidative stress and plasma antioxidative capacity were determined with the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assays, respectively. There was no significant difference in AChIR among experimental groups of rats. In CTR and DM group of rats, AChIR was mediated by NO and EETs pathway, while in the CTR+HBO and DM+HBO groups, NO-pathway prevailed. iNOS expression was upregulated in the DM group compared to CTR, while HBO2 upregulated eNOS in CTR group and TBXAS1 in DM group of rats. In both, CTR and DM group of rats, the sensitivity to ACh in the presence of L-NAME or in the presence of MSPPOH was significantly decreased compared to the response to ACh in the absence or presence of indomethacin or HET0016. DM and DM+HBO rats had increased TBARS compared to their respective controls. In conclusion, HBO2 presumably alters vasorelaxation in response to ACh from NO-EETs mediated pathways to solely NO-pathway, without affecting oxidative status of DM rats.Copyright© Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681978>Excess weight loss in a patient with type 2  treated with an SGLT- 2 inhibitor.</a></h1><p>We present a 62-year-old obese male patient with a 12-year history of type 2  and poor glycemic control: HbA1c 12% (108 mmol/mol).

We hypothesized that hydroxyethyl starch 6% (130/0.4) has a more distinct effect on coagulation and glycocalyx shedding than albumin 5%.Presented data derive from an exploratory subgroup analysis of a prospective randomized, single-blinded trial comparing albumin 5% versus balanced hydroxyethyl starch 6% (130/0.4). Patients between 46 and 85 years undergoing cystectomy were included. Prothrombin time, plasma fibrinogen concentration, partial thromboplastin time, thrombelastometry and platelet function were analyzed before and after surgery. Glycocalyx components were assessed before and after surgery, 2 to 4 h after surgery and at 1st and 3rd postoperative day. Primary outcome parameter was the change of thrombelastometric variables at the end of surgery. Further variables included calculated blood loss, infusion amount and transfusion rate.55 patients (albumin group n = 28; hydroxyethyl starch group n = 27) were included. Thrombelastometric variables were significantly more compromised in the hydroxyethyl starch than in the albumin group whereas platelet function, glycocalyx shedding, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and fibrinogen were not different between groups. Mean intraoperative calculated blood loss was higher in the hydroxyethyl starch group (1557 ± 825 ml versus 1245 ± 709 ml; p = 0.042). Transfusion requirements did not differ.Rotational thrombelastometric variables were significantly more reduced when hydroxyethyl starch was used compared to albumin 5%.

Even though the feasibility and utility of CGM has been proven successfully in Type 1 and 2 , there is a lack of knowledge of its application and effectiveness in pregnancy, especially in gestational  (GDM). In this review, we aimed to summarize and evaluate the updated scientific evidence on the application of CGM in pregnancies complicated with GDM.  A search using keywords related to CGM and GDM on PubMed was conducted and articles were filtered based on full text, year of publication (Jan 1998-Dec 2018), human subject studies, and written in English. Reviews and duplicate articles were removed. A final total of 29 articles were included in this review.  In terms of maternal and fetal outcomes, inconsistent evidence was reported. Among GDM patients using CGM and SMBG, two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found no significant differences in macrosomia, birth weight (BW), and gestational age (GA) at delivery between these two groups, while one prospective cohort found a lower incidence of cesarean section and macrosomia in CGM use subjects. Furthermore, CGM use was consistently found to have increased detection in dysglycemia and glycemic variability compared to SMBG. In terms of clinical utility, CGM use led to more treatment adjustments and lower gestational weight gain (GWG). Lastly, CGM use showed higher postprandial glucose levels in GDM-complicated pregnancies than in normal pregnancies.  Current updated evidence suggests that CGM is superior to SMBG among GDM pregnancies in terms of detecting hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes, which might result in an improvement of maternal and fetal outcomes. In addition, CGM detects a wider glycemic variability in GDM mothers than non-GDM controls. Further research with larger sample sizes and complete pregnancy coverage is needed to explore the clinical utility such as screening and predictive values of CGM for GDM.Copyright © 2019 Yu, Aris, Tan and Li.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679620>Variability in High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin T Testing in Stable Patients With and Without Coronary Artery Disease.</a></h1><p>High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) is used to diagnosis acute myocardial infarction, often based on values exceeding the 99th percentile threshold (14 ng/L) of normal populations.

It is distributed widely in the Central and East Anatolia. This study was carried out for evaluation of the antioxidant activity, enzyme inhibition effect, elemental and phenolic content of A. schischkinii. Briefly, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), α-glycosidase (α-Gly), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes were strongly inhibited by A. schischkinii. IC values for AChE, BChE, α-Gly, and GST enzymes were found as 19.3 mg/mL, 15.4 mg/mL, 69.3 mg/mL, and 34.7 mg/mL respectively. The antioxidant activity of the sample was evaluated by four different in vitro bioanalytical methods. Besides, the concentrations of twelve elements in A. schischkinii were analyzed by ICP-MS technique. Zn (50.6 ppm), Mn (23.0 ppm), and Cu (12.7 ppm) were found as major elements.

Currently, preventative screenings for these conditions are restricted to high-risk populations and extremely expensive. The discovery of clinically indicative biomarkers has been revolutionary in advancing screening and diagnostic capabilities. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an extracellular secreted protein of the prostate gland, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), an enzyme of neuronal origin, have reported reputable specificity for prostate cancer and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Current efforts are underway to develop a rapid, label-free means of measuring both PSA and NSE levels in a clinical environment for early screening applications of highly metastatic cancers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and impedance time (Z-t) are rapid, sensitive electrochemical techniques previously validated in the detection of several clinically relevant biomarkers, including cardiovascular disease and . Herein, we determine the optimal frequencies of PSA (81.38 Hz) and NSE (14.36 Hz) using EIS that are robust across analytical platforms and in the presence of potentially interfering species. The reported empirical evidence supports the prevalence of electrostatic interactions in electrochemical systems and provides alternative theoretical support of previous findings.

By binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, medications such as inhaled and oral corticosteroids can enhance the systemic effects of cortisol and result in iatrogenic Cushing syndrome. Prolonged use suppresses the body's ability to make cortisol, resulting in iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency upon medication discontinuation. Chronic use of inhaled and oral corticosteroids can negatively affect bone health, growth, and glucose metabolism. This chapter provides practical guidelines regarding the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency. As the guidelines are mainly derived from the asthma literature, this chapter also highlights the need for studies to evaluate the impact of CF therapies on adrenal function and other CF-endocrinopathies.Copyright © 2019 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.

The primary etiology is relative insulin insufficiency secondary to destruction of pancreatic islets, and to other factors that affect the function of the remaining beta cells. The prevalence of CFRD increases markedly with age and more than half of CF adults develop the disease. As the initial presentation of CFRD may be clinically silent, annual screening is recommended starting at least by the age of 10 with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The importance of an early diagnosis is based on the association of  and abnormal glucose tolerance with worse health outcomes in patients with CF, and evidence that early treatment of  improves prognosis. This review presents a concise overview of the current understanding of CFRD pathogenesis, natural history, screening and diagnosis.Copyright © 2019.

We investigated if high inter-leg systolic blood pressure difference associates with cardiovascular events and increased mortality in hemodialysis patients.Among 118 incident Japanese dialysis patients, bilateral leg blood pressure, arm blood pressure, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, and ankle-brachial index were measured, and the relative risk associated with inter-leg systolic blood pressure difference and other indices of vascular status was analyzed.During follow-up (median, 46 months), 18 deaths and 75 cardiovascular events occurred in 38 patients. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that higher inter-leg systolic blood pressure difference was associated with overall (log-rank 9.35, p = 0.002) and cardiovascular (log-rank 5.81, p = 0.02) mortality. The period from the start of dialysis therapy to the first cardiovascular event was shorter as inter-leg systolic blood pressure difference increased (log-rank 23.7, p < 0.0001). In Cox hazard models, inter-leg systolic blood pressure difference greater than median independently predicted deaths (relative risk, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-13.9) and cardiovascular events (relative risk, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-9.21) after adjustments for age, sex, nutritional status, and , whereas other indices were not related to the risks. For well-nourished, moderately malnourished, and severely malnourished patients, the cumulative number of cardiovascular events in the high-inter-leg systolic blood pressure difference patients were 4.96, 31.44, and 55.18 events per 100 patient-years.Higher inter-leg systolic blood pressure difference associated with increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular events suggesting that wider application of inter-leg systolic blood pressure difference measurements may be warranted in hemodialysis patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677496>Risk factors for reduced fetal movements in pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Maternal perception of reduced fetal movements (RFM) is an important clinical marker to identify women at higher risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Preventing and reducing stillbirths can only be achieved through better detection and management of women with RFM, however the characteristics of women who present with RFM in pregnancy vary. A systematic review was conducted to explore the risk factors associated with reduced fetal movements (RFM) in pregnancy. PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Maternity and Infant Care, PsycINFO and Science Citation Index were searched, from their inception date, for studies published up to 16 May 2019. Non-randomised observational studies reporting risk factors in pregnant women presenting with a primary complaint of RFM during pregnancy were included. The quality of the included studies was assessed with the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 software for each identified risk factor where two or more studies reported on the same risk factor. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Twenty-seven studies reporting on risk factors for RFM during pregnancy were included. Women presenting with RFM during pregnancy are more likely to be Caucasian, smokers, and have an anterior placenta, oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios. No difference was found in parity or the mean age of women presenting with RFM and women who did not present with RFM. Previous caesarean section, postdates >42 weeks', and other medical conditions, including  and hypertensive disorders were not predictive for RFM during pregnancy. Modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors associated with RFM in pregnancy were identified. These results can be used to raise awareness of factors associated with RFM, and prompt women to attend their maternity care provider should concerns arise.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Rabson-Mendenhall/Donohue syndrome is also caused by defects of the insulin receptor gene (INSR) but is more serious than type A IRS. We here performed a nationwide survey of these syndromes in Japan.We sent questionnaires to a total of 1957 academic councilors or responsible individuals at certified facilities of the Japan  Society as well as at the department pediatrics or neonatology in medical centers with >300 beds.We received 904 responses with information on 23, 30, and 10 cases of type A or B IRS and Rabson-Mendenhall/Donohue syndrome, respectively. Eight cases with type A IRS-like clinical features but without an abnormality of INSR were tentatively designated type X IRS, with five of these cases testing positive for PIK3R1 mutations. Fasting serum insulin levels at diagnosis (means±SD) were 132.0±112.4, 1122.1±3292.5, 2895.5±3181.5, and 145.0±141.4 μU/ml for type A IRS, type B IRS, Rabson-Mendenhall/Donohue syndrome, and type X IRS, respectively. Type A and type X IRS as well as Rabson-Mendenhall/Donohue syndrome were associated with low birth weight. Type B IRS was diagnosed most frequently in elderly individuals and was often associated with concurrent autoimmune conditions and hypoglycemia.Information yielded by this first nationwide survey should provide epidemiological insight into these rare conditions and inform better health care for affected patients.© 2019 The Authors.

Under physiologic conditions, there is a distinct and finely tuned balance between the utilization of these substrates. Using the non-ischemic heart as an example, we discuss that upon stress this substrate balance is upset resulting in an over-reliance on either fatty acids or glucose, and that chronic fuel shifts towards a single type of substrate appear to be linked with cardiac dysfunction. These observations suggest that interventions aimed at re-balancing a tilted substrate preference towards an appropriate mix of substrates may result in restoration of cardiac contractile performance. Examples of manipulating cellular substrate uptake as a means to re-balance fuel supply, being associated with mended cardiac function underscore this concept. We also address the molecular mechanisms underlying the apparent need for a fatty acid-glucose fuel balance. We propose that re-balancing cellular fuel supply, in particular with respect to fatty acids and glucose, may be an effective strategy to treat the failing heart.Copyright © 2019 The Author.

Despite increasing evidence that cytokines operate in concert, many of the physiological interactions between cytokines, and the shared genetic architecture that underlies them, remain unknown. Here, we aimed to identify and characterize genetic variants with pleiotropic effects on cytokines. Using three population-based cohorts (n = 9,263), we performed multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for a correlation network of 11 circulating cytokines, then combined our results in meta-analysis. We identified a total of eight loci significantly associated with the cytokine network, of which two (PDGFRB and ABO) had not been detected previously. In addition, conditional analyses revealed a further four secondary signals at three known cytokine loci. Integration, through the use of Bayesian colocalization analysis, of publicly available GWAS summary statistics with the cytokine network associations revealed shared causal variants between the eight cytokine loci and other traits; in particular, cytokine network variants at the ABO, SERPINE2, and ZFPM2 loci showed pleiotropic effects on the production of immune-related proteins, on metabolic traits such as lipoprotein and lipid levels, on blood-cell-related traits such as platelet count, and on disease traits such as coronary artery disease and type 2 .Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

Early detection and monitoring of bone mineral density and multidisciplinary preventive care are necessary from childhood through adolescence to minimize CF-related bone disease (CFBD) in adult CF patients. Approaches to optimizing bone health include ensuring adequate nutrition, particularly intake of calcium and vitamins D and K, addressing other secondary causes of low bone density such as hypogonadism, encouraging weight bearing exercise, and avoiding bone toxic medications. Of the currently available anti-resorptive or anabolic osteoporosis medications, only bisphosphonates have been studied in individuals with CF.

The most feasible explanation for this association is the hypothesis of catch up. Some studies postulate a greater influence of catch up growth than the low birth weight itself in developing metabolic and cardiovascular disease.This is a prospective cohort study of newborns with intrauterine growth restriction (defined as weight percentile at birth less than 10th) born during a one-year period. Clinical data of patients were recorded (gender, gestational age, data about breastfeeding and anthropometry during follow-up every 3 months). Some details of pregnancy and characteristics of the mother were also registered. Serum biochemical parameters (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, DLD cholesterol, triglycerides, HOMA) were collected at birth from cord blood, 9 and 12 months. Two main comparative groups were established: those GRF who made a catch-up growth (increase in weight Z score higher than 0,67) during the follow-up and those who did not get it.126 GRF children were born in the study period. 125 accepted the inclusion in the study and 67 of them completed the full monitoring for a year; 47 of them made recovery growth and 20 did not. A significant difference between both groups was found in glucose in umbilical cord and triglycerides at 12 months: GRF children with catch up growth showed lower glucose levels (p = 0.03) and higher levels of triglycerides (p = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in the rest of laboratory parameters analyzed (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, DLD cholesterol, HOMA at 9 and 12 months or triglycerides at 9 months).Those GRF with catch up growth during the first year of life have early changes in the triglycerides at the end of that period with higher levels than those GRF children without catch up growth. This finding could be useful to develop a tool for early detection of GRF children with higher metabolic risk in order to prevent future pathology.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with LGA birthweight.LGA was significantly higher in those with T1DM (39%) than T2DM (17%) (p<0.001). Among those with T1DM, there was a nonsignificant association between LGA and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.39; p=0.06) and excess maternal weight gain (T1DM odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.43; p=0.069).

Hypovitaminosis D is often the result of fat malabsorption, but other contributors include increased latitude, poor nutritional intake, decreased sun exposure, impaired hydroxylation of vitamin D, and non-adherence to the prescribed vitamin D regimen. Vitamin D is critical for calcium homeostasis and optimal skeletal health, and vitamin D deficiency in CF can lead to skeletal complications of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Over time, our understanding of treatment regimens for vitamin D deficiency in CF has evolved, leading to recommendations for higher doses of vitamin D to achieve target levels of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D. There is also some evidence that vitamin D deficiency may have non-skeletal consequences such as an increase in pulmonary exacerbations. The exact mechanisms involved in the non-skeletal complications of vitamin D deficiency are not clearly understood, but may involve the innate immune system. Future clinical studies are needed to help address whether vitamin D has a role in CF beyond skeletal health.Copyright © 2019 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.

The role of gender in characteristics of renal lesions has remained unexplored.Male and female OVE26 mice were compared to age and sex matched wild-type, nondiabetic FVB mice at ages of 4, 12, 24 and 36 weeks. Nephropathy was examined by measuring urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, histopathology, expression of pathological markers and immunochemistry in the same cohort of mice.Progression of diabetic kidney disease was evident first in the OVE26 glomerulus, initially as mesangial matrix expansion at 4 weeks followed by loss of podocytes, glomerular volume expansion and severe albuminuria at 12 weeks. Tubule dilation and initiation of interstitial fibrosis did not become significant until 24 weeks. T-lymphocyte infiltration into the renal parenchyma appeared at 36 weeks. OVE26 female mice developed more advanced DN than male OVE26 mice, such as more severe albuminuria, greater podocyte loss, additional fibrosis and significantly more inflammatory cell infiltration. The female OVE26 mice had lowest level of plasma estradiol in all 36 weeks old mice, as well as renal estrogen receptors.This demonstration of the role of gender, combined with the detailed characterization of DN progression illustrates the value of OVE26 mice for understanding gender effects on DN and provides the basis for researchers to better select the age and sex of OVE26 mice in future studies of type 1 DN.What is already known about this subject?

Reported here is our characterization of its therapeutic profiles in three mouse models with distinctive pathological features of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Our results firstly showed that AF alleviated high fat (HF) induced obesity and associated glucose intolerance, suggesting its therapeutic efficacy for MetS. In the type 2  (T2D) model induced by a combination of HF and low doses of streptozotocin, AF lowered hyperglycaemia and improved insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. In the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-like model resulting from a HF and high cholesterol (HF-HC) diet, AF reversed the increased liver triglyceride and cholesterol, plasma aspartate aminotransferase, and liver TNFα mRNA levels. Consistent with its effect in promoting glucose disposal in HF-fed mice, AF stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in L6 myotubes. However, these effects were unlikely to be associated with activation of insulin, AMPK, ER, or cellular stress signalling cascades. Further studies revealed that AF increased the whole-body energy expenditure and physical activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that AF exerts a therapeutic potential for MetS and related diseases possibly by promoting physical activity associated whole-body energy expenditure and glucose uptake in muscle. These effects are possibly mediated by a new mechanism distinct from other therapeutics derived from Chinese medicine.Copyright © 2019 Zhou, Fouda, Zeng, Li, Zhang, Xu and Ye.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678573>Exosomes: Current Use and Future Applications.</a></h1><p>Exosomes are endosomal-derived vesicles that play a critical role in cell-to-cell communication and are secreted in several biological fluids including serum, saliva, urine, ascites, and cerebro-spinal fluid amongst others.

However, the literature concerning predictive outcome factors and bacterial sampling is scarce. To identify potential associations between revision surgery and underlying bacteria or other preoperative selection criteria, we reviewed all patients with TMA who were treated at our institution. We compared the patients with remissions with surgical revisions. Among 96 adult patients with TMA (105 amputations), 42 required a revision surgery (40%), 18 had a further minor proximal surgical reamputation (17%) and 18 had a major proximal surgical reamputation (14%). In group comparisons, a previous infection with Staphylococcus aureus was protective with a lower revision risk (4/26 with revision surgery vs 22/26 without revisions; p = .03). This was the opposite for postoperative persistent soft tissue or bone infections (p < .01) and delayed wound healing (p < .01), which were positively associated with a revision risk. The American Society of Anesthesiologists Score, sex, age, body mass index, , polyneuropathy, chronic renal failure, dialysis, peripheral arterial disease, smoking status, and antibiotic regimen did not influence this revision risk. These results must be interpreted cautiously because no multiple variable calculations could be conducted as a result of the paucity of cases and confounding could not be evaluated sufficiently. TMA is an option to prevent major amputations, but it may be associated with a subsequent revision risk of 40% in adult patients. In our cohort study, persistent postamputation infection and delayed wound healing were associated with revision. However, no preoperative selection criteria were found that lead to revision surgery except for an infection with Staphylococcus aureus, which protected against revision surgery.Copyright © 2019 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

The latter favors a chronic low-grade inflammatory state and an over-activation of the innate immune system, which contribute to insulin resistance and type 2 . Physical exercise is a powerful preventive tool and treatment for several diseases as it induces metabolic and immune effects that provide health benefits. Exercise is known to reduce inflammation; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible are not fully elucidated. One proposed mechanism is a reduced expression and/or activation of pro-inflammatory toll-like receptors (TLRs) on innate immune cells after exercise, which could contribute to the protective effect of exercise against insulin resistance and the prevention of the development of metabolic diseases. The aim of the present study is therefore to review the current evidence about the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise and toll-like receptors regulation on immune cells in humans. Key PointsObesity leads to a low-grade chronic inflammatory state and an over-activation of the innate immune system that is directly involved in the develop metabolic syndrome.The anti-inflammatory effect of exercise has been previously suggested through the reduction of the expression and/or activation of pro-inflammatory toll-like receptors (TLRs) in innate immune cells, which represent one of the main inflammatory responses triggered by obesityThe underlying mechanisms in which toll-like receptors expression modulate the reduction of chronic inflammation are not fully elucidated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682975>Development and characterization of mucoadhesive-thermoresponsive gels for the treatment of oral mucosa diseases.</a></h1><p>The mucositis is an inflammatory, erosive and ulcerative process of the oral mucosa.

The objective of the study was to verify the association between body mass index (BMI) and severity of CAD, its risk factors and surgical and percutaneous treatment in patients hospitalized in cardiological units.An ambispective, cross-sectional study was performed with patients older than 18 years attended by nutrition in the cardiology units, who underwent coronary angiography. The severity of CAD was categorized into two distinct classifications (CAD Class I and II), considering the presence of CAD as lesions ≥50% and ≥70%. The nutritional status of the patient was established based on BMI according to the World Health Organization (WHO) for the total sample and group of adults, and according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for the elderly. Age, gender, presence of associated comorbidities, history of smoking, and performed procedures were collected in patients' records. For statistical analysis Kruskal Wallis and Chi-square tests were used, and Hodges-Lehmann estimate was used for the median. Comparisons and associations were considered significant when p < 0.05.A total of 703 patients were included, of which 495 had arterial lesions ≥70% and 513 patients' lesions ≥50%. The average age was 61 years, women were older (63 vs 61; p = 0.008), had a higher BMI (28.16 kg/m vs 26.68 kg/m, p = 0.001) and were more likely to have  (DM) (p < 0.001), dyslipidemia (DSLP) (p < 0.001), and hypertension (HTN) (p = 0.001). The majority of the sample consisted of men, who more often underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (53,9% vs 39%, p < 0.001), and were more likely to present more severe CAD (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003). In patients diagnosed with CAD the increase in BMI was positively associated with the presence of DM (p < 0.001), DSLP (p < 0.001) and HTN (p < 0.001), and negatively with age (p = 0.007). Patients with obesity III, were diagnosed with CAD, in average, 11 years earlier than patients with normal BMI (p = 0.05). Therefore, the higher the BMI, the lower the age at the moment of the examination in the total sample, and in the group of elderly, and this association was not found in adults. There was no significant association of BMI with the severity of CAD, or with PCI and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The greater severity of CAD was positively associated with the presence of DM (p = 0.012 and p = 0.001), HTN (p = 0.033 and p = 0.003) and older age (p = 0.005 and p = 0.015). Patients who underwent CABG had a higher incidence of and HTN (p = 0.003), DM (p = 0.006), whereas patients who had PCI had a lower incidence of HTN (p = 0.021) and DM (p = 0.004).Obesity was showed to be as an independent risk factor for the early incidence of CAD, which is strongly associated with the presence of comorbidities such as DM, HTN and DSLP. The greater severity of CAD and coronary interventions were associated with the presence of risk factors for CAD.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The vast majority of men with CF are infertile due to obstructive azoospermia. Multiple factors associated with CF contribute to an increased prevalence of testosterone deficiency, which adversely affects muscle mass, bone density, and quality of life. This article reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of infertility and testosterone deficiency that occur in men with CF. With improving survival of CF patients, these topics are becoming more significant in their clinical care.Copyright © 2019 European Cystic Fibrosis Society. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The recommended treatment is insulin therapy. Insulin therapy in CF should be customized to the specific patient. CF patients typically require intensive insulin regimens such as multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy, but frequently require lower doses than in type 1 . Patients with CF may also need insulin to cover intravenous or enteral feedings. Pre-diabetic glycaemic abnormalities are also associated with clinical decline in cystic fibrosis prior to the diagnosis of CFRD, however, whether and how this should be treated is not fully determined. There is also interest, but inadequate data regarding other treatments besides insulin (i.e., oral medications) for treatment of pre- or CFRD. CFTR potentiator and corrector therapy has yet to demonstrate an effect on the rate of CFRD, but may improve insulin secretion. There is great opportunity for further research to better understand when and how best to treat glycaemic abnormalities in cystic fibrosis.Copyright © 2019.

Self-management of  including maintaining a healthy lifestyle is essential for glycemic control and to prevent  complications. Mobile-based health data can play an important role in the forecasting of blood glucose levels for lifestyle management and control of T2DM.The objective of this work was to dynamically forecast daily glucose levels in patients with T2DM based on their daily mobile health lifestyle data including diet, physical activity, weight, and glucose level from the day before.We used data from 10 T2DM patients who were overweight or obese in a behavioral lifestyle intervention using mobile tools for daily monitoring of diet, physical activity, weight, and blood glucose over 6 months. We developed a deep learning model based on long short-term memory-based recurrent neural networks to forecast the next-day glucose levels in individual patients. The neural network used several layers of computational nodes to model how mobile health data (food intake including consumed calories, fat, and carbohydrates; exercise; and weight) were progressing from one day to another from noisy data.The model was validated based on a data set of 10 patients who had been monitored daily for over 6 months. The proposed deep learning model demonstrated considerable accuracy in predicting the next day glucose level based on Clark Error Grid and ±10% range of the actual values.Using machine learning methodologies may leverage mobile health lifestyle data to develop effective individualized prediction plans for T2DM management. However, predicting future glucose levels is challenging as glucose level is determined by multiple factors. Future study with more rigorous study design is warranted to better predict future glucose levels for T2DM management.©Syed Hasib Akhter Faruqui, Yan Du, Rajitha Meka, Adel Alaeddini, Chengdong Li, Sara Shirinkam, Jing Wang.

More recent reports have documented normal pubertal progression in the majority of individuals with CF. However, youth with more severe disease are still at risk for delayed puberty. Careful evaluation of pubertal development in children and adolescents with CF is important as pubertal timing impacts linear growth, bone mineral accrual, body image and psychosocial wellbeing, all of which can also be impacted directly by CF. This article reviews the physiology of puberty, timing of puberty in CF, evaluation of pubertal development, and the differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management of delayed and precocious puberty in people with CF.Copyright © 2019 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.

Preoperative and postoperative estimated glomerular ﬁltration rates (eGFRs) were calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. Clinicopathological data was analysed for new-onset CKD after at least five years of follow-up. Postoperative complications were measured by the modified Clavien classification system.Among 67 patients, 36.4% had  and 80.3% had hypertension. Pre-existing CKD with eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was present in 23.3% of PN and 43.2% of RN patients. RN and PN patients had similar postoperative morbidity. Those who underwent PN had immediate decline followed by gradual improvement of their kidney functions at six months after surgery and this improvement was sustained even for patients with four years of clinical follow-up. Among patients with normal preoperative kidney functions, new-onset CKD after surgery was found in 20.0% and 52.9% of PN and RN patients, respectively (p = 0.007).In our study, geriatric patients who underwent PN for localised kidney mass < 7 cm had immediate decline but gradual and sustained improvement in kidney functions.

CMC statuses for Auckland residents were modelled using hospitalization ICD-10 codes, pharmaceutical claims, and laboratory results. Population-level influenza rates in adults with congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma,  (DM), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were calculated by Poisson regression stratified by age and adjusted for ethnicity.Among 891,276 adults, 2,435 influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations occurred. Rates were significantly higher in those with CMCs compared with those without the respective CMC except older adults with DM or those aged <65 years with CVA. The largest effects occurred with CHF (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] range: 4.84-13.4 across age strata), ESRD (IRR range: 3.30-9.02), CAD (IRR range= 2.77-10.7), and COPD (IRR range: 5.89-8.78) and tapered with age.Our findings support the increased risk of severe, laboratory-confirmed influenza disease among adults with specific CMCs compared those without these conditions.© The Author(s) 2019.

Using Mobil-o-Graph (IEM, Germany), we derived BH (blood pressure, pulse pressure index, rate pressure product) and CH (aortic pressure, cardiac index, stroke volume index, stroke work). They were further compared and associated with DN in terms of creatinine, proteinuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).There were 89 males, mean age 56 years, mean duration 4.8 years, 80% hypertensive predominantly using ACE inhibitors, poor glycemic blood pressure (BP) control, mainly mild-to-moderate DN, mean eGFR 88.2, 34% prevalence of proteinuria. Arterial stiffness was high with female disadvantage. BH and CH parameters were not different with or without DN using proteinuria or eGFR (60 cutoff) criteria.

Normally, L-lactate is the major form in the human body. According to previous data, also D- and L-lactate might be increased in hyperglycaemic disorders.  We aimed to describe the kinetics and mechanisms of lactate concentration changes in ketoacidosis and newly diagnosed .  We performed a prospective study, including 5-18-year-old children with ketoacidosis (DKA, n = 13) and with newly diagnosed type 1  without ketoacidosis (T1DM, n = 6). We performed routine blood gas analysis 0-12-24-48 hours after admission, which also measured L-lactate levels. We also determined total venous serum lactate level by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.  Initial plasma lactate concentration was increased in ketoacidosis as compared to the newly diagnosed  group (p<0.05). After 12 h of rehydration, lactate levels were greatly reduced in ketoacidotic patients but after 24-48 h it was repeatedly increased (all p<0.01). In the 0-12 h phase, total serum lactate level was higher than L-lactate level, referring to D-lactate production.  We described two L-lactate peaks in ketoacidosis. In the first 12 hours anaerobic glycolysis seems to have major role in hyperlactataemia. We assume that stimulated aerobic glycolysis leads to the second lactate peak. However, D-lactate is not routinely measured, it may contribute to the initial hyperlactataemia in both groups and is comparable to L-lactate production in ketoacidosis.

Since high glucose levels are as toxic as lipids for hepatic metabolism, we hypothesize that altered response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to more severe NAFLD with significant/advanced liver damage.We studied 90 subjects with morbid obesity (73F/17M, BMI = 43.2 ± 5,9 kg/m) undergoing bariatric surgery and intraoperative liver biopsy, and measured HbA1c, HOMA-IR (fasting Glucose x Insulin/22.5), OGTT glucose and insulin profile, and calculated OGIS (muscle insulin sensitivity), hepatic-IR (glucose [AUC] x insulin [AUC]) during OGTT, insulin response as (insulin [dAUC]/glucose [dAUC] or Insulinogenic Index (IGI = (I-I)/(G-G)). Patients were divided in 3 groups according to liver biopsy: A (no-NAFLD, 23%), B (simple steatosis (SS), 53%) and C (NASH, 24%) with similar age, gender and BMI.  was 0% in no-NAFLD, 13% in SS, 35% in NASH. During OGTT, OGIS decreased from A to C (422 vs 360 vs 338, p < 0.01). Increased insulin concentrations, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and OGIS, not Hep-IR, were strongly associated to hepatic steatosis (p = 0.03, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 respectively). Hepatic fibrosis stage was mild as most of the patients had fibrosis grade-1 (69% vs. 8% no fibrosis) and associated to fasting insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR. dAUC-I/dAUC-G was similar in the 3 groups, while only AUC-I was strongly associated to steatosis (r = 0.35, p = 0.005), but not to fibrosis.In morbid obesity indexes of IR, and not of insulin response, are markers of histological severity of liver disease.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

We aimed to evaluate whether underweight women with twin pregnancies should gain more weight than normal-weight women in order to optimize perinatal outcomes.This retrospective cohort study compared the GWG and perinatal outcomes among normal-weight and underweight women who gave birth to viable twins between 2015 and 2018 at the Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Foshan, China. Gestational weight gain (GWG) was categorized as adequate or inadequate GWG, based on the US Institute of Medicine 2009 guidelines for normal-weight women (≥ 0.46 kg/week). The outcomes of interest included spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) <37 weeks, <35 and <32 weeks, small for gestational age (SGA), gestational hypertensive disorder (GHD), gestational  (GDM), birth weight discordance (BDW) ≥20%, neonatal intensive unit (NICU) admission and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). Propensity score matching (PSM, in a 1:1 ratio) was utilized to minimize the effects of confounders on the differences in the two cohorts. Multivariable logistic models were also used to verify the results from PSM analysis.There were 475 normal-weight and 111 underweight women included in the analysis. Our results suggested that the incidence of adequate GWG was comparable between underweight and normal-weight women (37.5% vs. 45.1%, P = 0.141). The prevalence of GDM was significantly lower among underweight women (9.9%) than among normal-weight women (20.4%) (P = 0.010). There was no evidence of differences in other perinatal outcomes between the two groups. 102 underweight women and 102 normal-weight women were included in PSM analyses. There was a lower incidence of GDM in underweight women than in normal-weight women, but the difference was not significant (9.8% vs. 18.6%, P = 0.071). No evidence of any differences in the other outcomes, including sPTB, GHD, BWD≥20%, SGA, NICU admission and NRDS, was found between the underweight and normal-weight women. Multivariable logistic regression models yielded similar results.For Chinese twin pregnant women with twin pregnancies, our data does provide evidence to suggest underweight women need to gain more weight than normal-weight women to optimize perinatal outcomes. Future studies with larger number of underweight women with twin gestations are warranted to establish an optimal range of GWG.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is a shortfall of compelling DN treatments and the mechanism potentially able to alleviate renal injury remains ambiguous. In this experiment, we estimated the preventive actions of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) on DN in rats and further investigated the underlying mechanism. The different doses of TMP (100 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) were orally given each day for 8 weeks in streptozotocin (STZ) - nicotinamide (NCT) - induced type-2 diabetic (T2D) rats. The metabolic parameters of , blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCR), urinary protein and oxidative stress parameters were assessed. Microstructural changes in kidney were observed, and the expression of Akt signalling pathway proteins was measured by western blotting. TMP administration in T2D rats improved diabetic condition, as demonstrated by significant (P < 0.05) increase of body weight and fasting serum insulin (FSI) level, reduction of fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level and regulation of lipid profile and oral glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner. TMP treatment also reduced BUN, SCR, urinary protein and oxidative stress and prevented renal injury in diabetic rats. TMP activated Akt signalling pathway, increased the levels of p-Akt and Bcl-2, and diminished the expressions of p-GSK-3β, Bax and cleaved caspase-3. In conclusion, TMP ameliorates diabetic nephropathy in T2D rats by initiating the Akt signalling, improving the metabolic markers of  and suppressing oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019.

The purpose of this study is to explore the potential accuracy of this combination of three cytokines in screening PCOS.186 individuals were recruited for this study. Circulating Irisin, Betatrophin and ZAG concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association between these serum biomarkers and PCOS was assessed by logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of these biomarkers for PCOS women.In women with PCOS, serum Irisin and Betatrophin levels were markedly elevated compared to those in healthy controls (p<0.01), while ZAG levels were lower (p<0.01). PCOS women with IR (M-value<6.28) had lower circulating ZAG concentrations, and higher circulating Irisin and Betatrophin levels relative to PCOS women without IR (M-value ≥ 6.28). ROC curve analyses showed that the AUC for Irisin, ZAG and Betatrophin for predicting PCOS were 0.77, 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. In a joint ROC curves analysis of these serum markers and other parameters, the results showed that the AUC was 0.93, and the sensitivity and specificity were 82.1 % and 92.3 %, respectively.When compared to using single cytokine, the analysis of Irisin, ZAG and Betatrophin elevates the accuracy in diagnosing PCOS.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679722>Endocrine complications after solid-organ transplant in cystic fibrosis.</a></h1><p>In individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), severe pulmonary or liver disease is frequently addressed with lung or liver transplant, respectively.

Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is also an attractive way to tackle type 2  (T2DM). We showed previously that azoloazine heterocycles have the potential to prevent the formation of AGEs and in this work, we conducted docking studies with DPP-4 of 5-alkylamino-6-nitro-1,3,4-thiadiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidines. Consequently, we have developed a synthetic approach to these structures by chlorodeoxygenation and amination reactions. Antidiabetic properties of obtained compounds were studied by evaluating DPP-4 (ex vivo/in vitro) and AGEs formation inhibition (in vitro). It was shown that the nitrothiadiazolopyrimidines exhibit a higher antiglycation activity than reference compound aminoguanidine, but only moderate inhibition of DPP-4. The most active DPP-4 inhibitor 1l had IC of 55.87 μM and showed the ability to inhibit serum DPP-4 activity in rats after 10 mg/kg oral administration but with the less and shorter effect than vildagliptin. At the same time, 1l was the most active antiglycating compound in the series (IC 134.4 μM). Copper chelation properties of synthesized compounds were also investigated since the formation of AGEs is catalyzed by the transition metal cations. A noticeable correlation between antiglycation activity and metal chelation was revealed. Both activities (antiglycation and copper chelation) correlated with quantum-chemical properties (calculated with ab initio) of the tested compounds. These findings will allow us to predict both activities in the future, without the need to model multiple steps of glycation reaction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The cumulative averages of fish and marine omega-3 PUFA intakes were evaluated based on 3-day 24-h records. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of T2D risk. Overall 1017 T2D cases were documented over a median of 14 years of follow-up. Compared with non-fish consumers, low and moderate fish consumption were associated with higher T2D risk whereas high fish consumption was not associated. Multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for low and moderate fish consumption were 1.43 (1.09, 1.86) and 1.42 (1.07, 1.85) respectively in men, and were 1.58 (1.22, 2.02) and 1.39 (1.08, 1.83) respectively in women. In meat substitution analyses, low and moderate fish consumption was related to 55% and 69% higher T2D risk for men, and was associated with 68% and 54% higher T2D risk for women, respectively. Fried but not non-fried fish intake was associated with higher T2D risk. Intake of marine omega-3 PUFAs was dose-dependently associated with higher T2D risk for both men and women (P-trend<0.001). Overall low and moderate intakes of fish, especially fried fish, and marine omega-3 PUFAs were associated with higher T2D risk. Current level of fish and marine omega-3 PUFA consumption is not protective against T2D incidence among Chinese people.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

MODY represents a heterogeneous group of non-insulin dependent  arising in childhood or adult life. Interestingly, clinical heterogeneity in MODY patients like variable disease onset and severity is observed even among individual family members sharing the same mutation, an issue that is not well understood. As high blood glucose levels are a well-known factor promoting β-cell stress and ultimately leading to cell death, we asked whether additional β-cell stress might account for the occurrence of disease heterogeneity in mice carrying a MODY4 mutation. In order to challenge β-cells, we established a MODY4 animal model based on Pdx1 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1) haploinsufficiency, which allows conditional modulation of cell stress by genetic inhibition of the stress-responsive IKK/NF-κB signalling pathway. While Pdx1+/- mice were found glucose intolerant without progressing to , additional challenge of β-cell function by IKK/NF-κB inhibition promoted rapid  development showing hyperglycaemia, hypoinsulinemia and loss of β-cell mass. Disease pathogenesis was characterized by deregulation of genes controlling β-cell homeostasis and function. Importantly, restoration of normal IKK/NF-κB signalling reverted the diabetic phenotype including normalization of glycaemia and β-cell mass. Our findings implicate that the avoidance of additional β-cell stress can delay a detrimental disease progression in MODY4 . Remarkably, an already present diabetic phenotype can be reversed when β-cell stress is normalized.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679723>Hypoglycemia in cystic fibrosis: Prevalence, impact and treatment.</a></h1><p>Hypoglycemia is a common and feared complication of insulin therapy. As in type 1 and type 2 , people with cystic fibrosis related  are also at risk for hypoglycemia related to insulin therapy. Spontaneous hypoglycemia is also common in patients with CF without , who are not on glucose lowering medications. Spontaneous hypoglycemia in CF may also occur during or after an oral glucose tolerance test. In this review, we will discuss the definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology and impact of hypoglycemia, with a focus on people with cystic fibrosis. We will also review strategies to manage and prevent hypoglycemia.Copyright © 2019 European Cystic Fibrosis Society. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Self-reported height, weight, age, gender, ethnicity, and parameters "Heart Problems," "Hypertension," "High Cholesterol," "," "Smoker Past 2 Years," "Ever Smoked?," "Family History AAA," and "Family History Brain Aneurysm" were provided. Incidence of a AAA (defined as 3 cm diameter) was calculated as a function of age and body mass index (BMI) of greater than or less than a BMI 25 for various patient groups. Age was grouped into one of three categories in 15-year intervals (35-50 years, 50-65 years, and 65 to 80 years). Most patients were Caucasian (n = 8575) and the largest group of patients with a AAA was the Caucasian male (198 of 279 total detected AAAs). A machine learning algorithm was written, with learning inputs from the acquired patient database. Of all groups, Caucasian males were found to have the highest incidence of AAA, with males in general higher than females. Smoking within the past two years was highly associated with AAA incidence, and a past history of smoking to a lesser extent. The incidence of AAA increased with age. When dividing groups into two cohorts by a BMI of 25, generally middle-aged patients with a BMI > 25 had a higher incidence of a AAA. However, in general, the older age group with a BMI < 25 had a higher incidence of AAA. The addition of machine learning allows one to note the effect of an input keeping other input parameters constant. This helps identify a parameter that may be an independent predictor of a particular outcome. When using BMI as the single changing input, an increasing BMI was associated with an increased probability of a AAA, most significantly in middle-aged patients, and then narrowing to similar probabilities in older age. This AAA screening program is ongoing. As data continues to be collected with particularly those patient groups presently underrepresented, questions as to an association of AAA with BMI as a function of age, and also an improvement in machine learning algorithm accuracy for various patient populations will continue.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678165>Prolyl isomerase Pin1 in metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells.</a></h1><p>Pin1 is one member of a group consisting of three prolyl isomerases. Pin1 interacts with the motif containing phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro of substrates and enhances cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds, thereby controlling the functions of these substrates. Importantly, the Pin1 expression level is highly upregulated in most cancer cells and correlates with malignant properties, and thereby with poor outcomes. In addition, Pin1 was revealed to promote the functions of multiple oncogenes and to abrogate tumor suppressors. Accordingly, Pin1 is well recognized as a master regulator of malignant processes. Recent studies have shown that Pin1 also binds to a variety of metabolic regulators, such as AMP-activated protein kinase, acetyl CoA carboxylase and pyruvate kinase2, indicating Pin1 to have major impacts on lipid and glucose metabolism in cancer cells. In this review, we focus on the roles of Pin1 in metabolic reprogramming, such as "Warburg effects", of cancer cells. Our aim is to introduce these important roles of Pin1, as well as to present evidence supporting the possibility of Pin1 inhibition as a novel anti-cancer strategy.Copyright © 2019.

Salidroside (SAL) is the important active ingredients isolated from Herba Cistanche, which exhibits numerous pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory effects. The present study was designed to determine whether SAL contributes to the recovery from spermatogenic dysfunction in streptozotocin (STZ) induced type-1 diabetic mice. SAL (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg) and Clomiphene citrate (CC, 5 mg/kg) were orally administered to male type-1 diabetic mice for 10 weeks. Testis tissues were collected for histopathological and biochemical analysis. Moreover, reproductive organ weight, sperm parameters, and testicular cell DNA damage were estimated. The results revealed that SAL significantly improved the weight of the reproductive organs, sperm parameters and testicular morphology to different degrees in type-1 diabetic mice. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly reduced, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH), markedly increased in the testicular tissue after SAL treatment. In addition, our data also showed a marked downregulation the fluorescence expressions of p38 MAPK phosphorylation and upregulation the protein expressions of ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-11 and N-cadherin after SAL administration (100 mg/kg) compared with the type-1 diabetic group. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that SAL exerts protective effects on type-1 -induced male spermatogenic dysfunction, which is likely mediated by inhibiting oxidative stress-mediated blood testis barrier damage.Copyright © 2019.

We retrospectively reviewed 137 diabetic patients admitted to the hospital with Infectious Diseases Society of America moderate and severe DFIs. We used SIRS criteria to define severe infection based on the presence of at least 2 of the following: heart rate >90 bpm, temperature >38°C or <36°C, respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute, and white blood cell count >12,000/mm or <4,000/mm. Patients with severe DFI were significantly younger (median 49.6 versus 53.6 years, p = .04), less often had type 2  (88.6% versus 98.9%, p = .01), and less often had a history of previous amputation (15.9% versus 40.9%, p < .01). There were no differences in patients with severe infections defined by SIRS versus moderate infections in the need for surgery (47.7% versus 59.1%, p = .27), any amputation (20.5% versus 29.0%, p = .29), leg amputations (6.8% versus 7.5%, p = .88), duration of antibiotics (median ± standard deviation 34.1 ± 46.5 versus 31.9 ± 47.2 days, p = .47), or healing within 1 year (68.2% versus 66.7%, p = 1.00). Length of hospital stay was the only outcome variable that was significantly different in severe infections (median 12.7 ± 11.9 versus 7.8 ± 5.8 days, p = .02).

A questionnaire in Arabic language was used. It consisted of five parts that covered patients demographic and DM relevant profile, hypoglycemia attacks during Ramadan, compliance with drug, diet, exercise and glucose monitoring. Four PHCCs in Abha city were selected randomly to conduct this study. All diabetic patients who attended the selected PHCCs during the month of Shawwal 1439 (corresponding to June-July 2018) were interviewed by the investigators. Data were coded, entered and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Appropriate statistical tests were used accordingly and  value was considered as significant if it was less than 5%.The total patients participated in this study was 378. The mean age was 45 years, males represents 51%, mean duration of DM was 12 years, type-1DM constitutes about one third. Most of type-1 DM patients used act rapid and long acting insulin (65%), while in type-2 DM, more than one third (38%) used OHA, 8% were on insulin alone. More than half of patients (52%) reported at least one attack of hypoglycemia during Ramadan, (29%) out of them had more than four attacks. About two third of attacks (67%) occurred in the morning and evening while less than one fourth have hypoglycemia at night (17%), (2%) visited ER or PHC and 1% were admitted to hospital for further management.This study revealed that the incidence of hypoglycemia among diabetics was high. Many Risk factors were identified; young age, type-1 DM, long duration of DM, insulin use. More attacks occurred during Ramadan day period and led to breaking the fasting among all affected patients. Most of patients were not given instructions regarding self-care immediately before or during Ramadan. Structured health education program for diabetics attending PHCC should be constructed and implemented before beginning of Ramadan in order to minimize the incidence of acute complications particularly hypoglycemia.Copyright: © 2019 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682826>Differential Levels of Hippo Signaling in Selected Brain and Peripheral Tissues in Streptozotocin-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction in Mice.</a></h1><p>Increasing studies have revealed that metabolic disorders, especially , are high risk factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. It has been reported that patients with  are prone to suffer from cognitive dysfunction (CD). Although abnormal glucose metabolism and deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) are proven to have a closely relationship with -induced CD, its exact mechanism is still undetermined. In this study, a total of 14 mice were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin for 5 consecutive days to mimic diabetic models, and then hierarchical cluster analysis was adopted to classify the diabetic mice into CD and Non-CD phenotypes by the results of Morris water maze test (MWMT). Furthermore, we detected Hippo signaling including mammalian sterile 20-like protein kinases1 (MST1), large tumor suppressors 1 (LATS1), Yes-associated protein (YAP) and phosphorylation of YAP (p-YAP) in brain and peripheral tissues. As compared with control mice, the levels of MST1, LATS1 and p-YAP/YAP ratio were increased in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), striatum and hippocampus of CD mice, while these proteins were decreased in gut tissue of CD mice. Additionally, there were significant positive correlations between escape latency and p-YAP/YAP ratio in mPFC, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus, as well as the level of LATS1 in liver, kidney and gut tissues. In conclusion, alterations in Hippo signaling may contribute to CD induced by . Therefore, therapeutic interventions improving Hippo signaling might be beneficial to the treatment of -induced CD and other neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

This study aimed to evaluate whether the CLD prevalence changed between 1998-2001 and 2016-2017. Data were extracted from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1998-2001 to 2016-2017; n=25,893). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was defined as a hepatic steatosis index >36 in the absence of any other evidence of CLD. The definition of alcoholrelated liver disease (ALD) was excessive alcohol consumption (≥210 g/week for men and ≥140 g/week for women) and an ALD/NAFLD index >0. The prevalence of NAFLD increased from 18.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.8-19.5%) in 1998-2001 to 21.5% (95% CI, 20.6-22.6%) in 2016-2017. During the same time period, increases were observed in the prevalence of obesity (27.0 vs. 35.1%), central obesity (29.4 vs. 36.0%),  (7.5 vs. 10.6%), and excessive drinking (7.3 vs.10.5%). ALD prevalence also increased from 3.8% (95% CI, 3.4-4.2%) to 7.0% (95% CI, 6.4-7.6%). In contrast, chronic hepatitis B decreased from 5.1% (95% CI, 4.6-5.5%) to 3.4% (95% CI, 3.0-3.8%). The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C was approximately 0.3% in 2016-2017. The prevalence of NAFLD and ALD increase among Korean adults.

The present study aims to assess the impact of a high fat diet on tuberculosis progression and microbiota composition in an experimental animal model using a C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain submitted to single or multiple consecutive aerosol infections. These models allowed us to study the protection induced by Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination as well as by the natural immunity induced by chemotherapy after a low dose  infection. Our results show that a high fat diet is able to trigger a pro-inflammatory response, which results in a faster progression toward active tuberculosis and an impaired protective effect of BCG vaccination, which is not the case for natural immunity. This may be related to dysbiosis and a reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the gut microbiota caused by a decrease in the abundance of the Porphyromonadaceae family and, in particular, the  genus. It should also be noted that a high fat diet is also related to an increase in the genera , and , which have previously been related to dysbiotic processes.

Demographics and clinical characteristics including (dis)continuation up until July 31 2018 were obtained from medical records.After six months, 54 adults were still using RT-CGM. Short-term discontinuation (10%) was mainly related to end of pregnancy (wish). Longer-term discontinuation in those with an initial non-pregnancy indication was related to changes in the medical condition and behavioural/psychological reasons. After six months, HbA -specific worries and self-efficacy improved (range d=|0.4|-|0.8|), while hypoglycaemia rate or awareness and more general distress did not change. More suboptimal scores at baseline were related to meaningful improvements in HbA (≥10 mmol/mol; 0.9%) and PROs (≥0.5 SD). Changes in glycaemic variables and PROs were not related.People with more suboptimal HbA and PRO values appear to benefit most from RT-CGM.

The aim of this review was to summarize information on the association between dietary habits and the risk of developing T2D.We conducted a comprehensive literature search using the PubMed database from its inception to June, 2019. Articles were restricted to those written in English and concerning human subjects. Relevant manuscripts found in the list of references of the retrieved articles were also used in preparation for the review.Animal protein consumption increases the risk of T2D independently of body mass index. Intake of both unprocessed meat and processed meat is strongly and consistently associated with increased risk of developing T2D. In contrast, consumption of high-quality vegetable foods prevents the disease. High-quality plant foods include whole grains, nuts, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Among less healthy plant-based foods are fruit juices, sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes, sweets, and desserts. Carbohydrate-restricted diets that encourage consumption of animal products promote T2D. Low intake of animal products is linked to high educational level so that well-informed individuals tend to consume diets with elevated content of vegetable food. According to the American Dietetic Association, "appropriately planned vegetarian diets including vegan diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases".restricting animal products while increasing healthy plant-based foods intake facilitates T2D prevention. To neutralize worldwide the burden of T2D and its devastating complications, animal products consumption should be limited or discontinued.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

In the experiment I, the rats were fed with fructose for 8 wks along with allopurinol or benzbromarone at the beginning. In the experiment II, the rats were fed with fructose for 8 wks firstly. And then, these rats were treated with allopurinol or benzbromarone for additional 6 wks.Fructose-fed rats showed hyperuricemia, abdominal obesity hypertension and an activation in adipose renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Also, fructose-fed rats had higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and more macrophages infiltrating in adipose tissue. In the experiment I, allopurinol and benzbromarone significantly reduced serum uric acid at 8 wk. Adipose RAS overactivation, adipose inflammatory responses and the development of obesity hypertension were all effectively prevented by hyperuricemia inhibition. In the experiment II, 6-wk treatment with allopurinol and benzbromarone significantly decreased serum uric acid, downregulated adipose RAS, abolished adipose inflammation and improved obesity hypertension.In conclusion, urate-lowering therapy protects rats against fructose-induced obesity hypertension. The mechanisms appear to be via downregulated adipose RAS and reduced inflammation in adipose tissue.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682172>Blockade of Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Suppresses High Glucose-induced Angiotensinogen Augmentation in Renal Proximal Tubular Cells.</a></h1><p>Renal proximal tubular angiotensinogen (AGT) is increased by hyperglycemia (HG) in , which augments intrarenal angiotensin II formation contributing to the development of hypertension and kidney injury. Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is abundantly expressed in proximal tubular cells (PTC). This study investigated the effects of canagliflozin (CANA), an SGLT2 inhibitor, on HG-induced AGT elevation in cultured PTC. Mouse PTC were treated with 5-25 mM glucose. 0-10 µM CANA was applied one hour before glucose treatment. 10 mM glucose increased AGT mRNA and protein levels at 12 hours (3.06 ± 0.48-fold in protein), and 1 and 10µM CANA as well as SGLT2 shRNA attenuated the AGT augmentation. CANA did not suppress the elevated AGT levels induced by 25 mM glucose. Increased AGT expression induced by treatment with pyruvate, a glucose metabolite that does not require SGLT2 for uptake, was not attenuated by CANA. In HG-treated PTC, intracellular ROS levels were elevated compared to baseline (4.24 ± 0.23-fold) and these were also inhibited by CANA. Furthermore, Tempol, an antioxidant, attenuated AGT upregulation in HG-treated PTC. HG-induced AGT upregulation was not inhibited by an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, indicating that HG stimulates AGT expression in an angiotensin II-independent manner. These results indicate that enhanced glucose entry via SGLT2 into PTC elevates intracellular ROS generation by stimulation of glycolysis and consequent AGT augmentation. SGLT2 blockade limits HG-induced AGT stimulation, thus reducing the development of kidney injury in .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680956>-Inositol and Its Derivatives: Their Emerging Role in the Treatment of Human Diseases.</a></h1><p>-inositol has been established as an important growth-promoting factor of mammalian cells and animals. The role of -inositol as a lipotropic factor has been proven, in addition to its involvement as co-factors of enzymes and as messenger molecules in signal transduction. -inositol deficiency leads to intestinal lipodystrophy in animals and "inositol-less death" in some fungi.

Two streptozotocin-diabetic groups (a T1DM animal model), after 4 weeks of , were treated with subcutaneous infusion of either vehicle (n = 12) or C-peptide (n = 11). Two non-diabetic groups (vehicle, n = 10; C-peptide, n = 9) were treated using the same protocol as described for the diabetic mice. The treatment with C-peptide in the diabetic group reduced the urinary levels of IL17 and TNFα, as well as IL4 and IL10 (p < 0.05). Contrary, the diabetic + C-peptide group presented higher IL10 gene expression in kidney. Besides, it displayed a reduction of TNFα gene expression. The data suggest that C-peptide may modulate pro- and anti-inflammatory signalling pathways, resulting in attenuation of kidney inflammation in T1DM animal model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679129>Development and First Use of the Patient's Qualitative Assessment of Treatment (PQAT) Questionnaire in Type 2  to Explore Individualised Benefit-Harm of Drugs Received During Clinical Studies.</a></h1><p>Individualised benefit-harm assessments can help identify patient-perceived benefits and harms of a treatment, and associated trade-offs that may influence patients' willingness to use a treatment. This research presents the first use of a patient-reported outcome measure designed to assess patient-perceived benefits and disadvantages of drugs received during clinical studies.The Patient's Qualitative Assessment of Treatment (PQAT) was developed in English and cognitively tested with US (n = 4) and Canadian (n = 3) patients with type 1 and type 2  (T2DM). The revised version of the PQAT comprises three qualitative open-ended questions focused on the benefits and disadvantages of treatment and reasons why patients would choose to continue/discontinue treatment. A final quantitative question asks patients to evaluate the balance between benefits and disadvantages using a 7-point scale. The revised version of the questionnaire was administered as an exploratory endpoint in a phase II clinical trial for a new injectable treatment for T2DM. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis, and relationships between qualitative and quantitative data were identified.Patient-reported benefits of treatment administered during the clinical trial included clinical markers of efficacy and subjective markers. Disadvantages reported by patients were mainly related to drug adverse effects or to the mode of administration. Of the 57 patients completing the PQAT, 70.2% reported being willing to continue treatment, with 59.6% reporting that the benefits outweighed the disadvantages. The reported benefits of feeling better and improved energy levels were more likely to be associated with a more positive ratio (70% and 71.4%, respectively), while the disadvantages of fatigue, headaches, and stomach pain were associated with a negative ratio and patients not being willing to continue the treatment.The PQAT is a unique patient-reported outcome tool designed to aid understanding patients' real experience of benefits and disadvantages of a treatment. It combines the richness of qualitative data with quantitative data-information valuable for various stakeholders to make well-informed treatment decisions.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679659>Outcomes of Foot Infections Secondary to Puncture Injuries in Patients With and Without .</a></h1><p>It is difficult to compare foot infections in patients with  to those without  because foot infections are uncommon in people without .

We previously reported that cognitive impairment is exacerbated in KKAy mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia (IH), during which the DNA binding protein HMGB1 mediates hippocampal neuronal apoptosis by maintaining microglia-associated neuroinflammation, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown.We performed immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry experiments in mouse hippocampal tissues and HT22 cells. KKAy type 2  model mice and normal C57BL/6J mice were exposed to IH or intermittent normoxia. HT22 cells were cultured in high glucose medium and exposed to IH or intermittent normoxia. We transfected HMGB1 siRNA into HT22 cells and then treated them with high glucose combined with intermittent hypoxia.In conclusion, IH aggravated apoptosis and autophagy defects in T2DM mice, and increased the protein expression of HMGB1 and TLR4. This was also confirmed in HG +IH-treated hippocampal HT22 cells. HMGB1 siRNA can significantly reduce the protein expression of HMGB1 and TLR4, reverse neuronal apoptosis and enhance autophagy.We believe that HMGB1 is a key factor in the regulation of hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and autophagy defects in T2DM combined with OSA. Targeting HMGB1/TLR4 signaling as a novel approach may delay or prevent the increased apoptosis and decreased autophagy induced by T2DM combined with OSA, and may ultimately improve cognitive dysfunction.Copyright © 2019.

Gliptins, which were introduced for clinical use a decade ago, have been shown to be beneficial against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in animals and humans. Cenicriviroc (CVC), a dual antagonist of C-C chemokine receptor type 2 and 5, is currently under investigation against NASH and fibrosis. It was previously discovered that evogliptin (EVO) reduces hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese animals but the effectiveness of EVO on NASH remains unexplored. Here, we compared the effectiveness of EVO and CVC against NASH and fibrosis in mice fed a high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFHF). Biochemical and histological analyses showed that mice fed a HFHF for 20 weeks developed severe hepatic steatosis and inflammation with mild fibrosis. Administration of EVO (0.2% wt/wt) for the last 8 weeks of HFHF feeding significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis as well as restored insulin sensitivity, as evidenced by lowered plasma insulin levels and the improvement in insulin tolerance test curves. Treatment of mice with CVC (0.1% wt/wt) inhibited hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis with similar efficacy to that of EVO, without affecting hepatic steatosis. CVC treatment also reduced plasma insulin concentrations, despite no improvement in insulin tolerance. In conclusion, EVO administration efficiently ameliorated the development of NASH and fibrosis in HFHF-fed mice, corroborating its therapeutic potential.Copyright © 2019 The Korean Physiological Society and The Korean Society of Pharmacology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682170>Aquaporins in the kidney: physiology and pathophysiology.</a></h1><p>The kidney is the central organ involved in maintaining water and sodium balance.

Its Mestizo and Indigenous communities present different levels of westernization which have triggered different epidemiological diseases. We assessed the effects of a multi-component school-based intervention program on obesity, cardiovascular and  risk factors.A physical activity, health education and parent involvement (PAHEPI) program was developed and applied in six urban (Mestizo ethnic group) and indigenous (Seri and Yaqui ethnic groups) primary schools for 12 weeks. A total of 320 children aged 4-12 years participated in intervention program; 203 under Treatment 1 (PAHEPI program) and 117, only from Mestizo groups, under Treatment 2 (PAHEPI+ school meals). For Body Mass Index (BMI), cardiovascular and  factors, pairwise comparisons of values at baseline and after treatments were done using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Generalized linear models were applied to assess the intervention effect by age, sex and nutritional status in relation to ethnicity and treatment.We observed improvements on BMI in children with overweight-obesity and in triglycerides in the three ethnic groups. The Mestizo ethnic group showed the largest improvements under Treatment 2. While Seris showed improvements only in cardiovascular risk factors, Yaquis also showed improvements in  risk factors, though not in BMI.This study showed that the same intervention may have positive but different effects in different ethnic groups depending on their lifestyle and their emerging epidemiological disease.

INR control was previously reported to be poorer among Asians compared to Westerners. We aimed to validate the SAMe-TT2R2 score for prediction of suboptimal INR control (defined as time in therapeutic range [TTR] < 65% in the Thai population) and to investigate TTR among Thai NVAF patients being treated with warfarin.INR data from patients enrolled in a multicentre NVAF registry was analysed. Clinical and laboratory data was prospectively collected. TTR was calculated using the Rosendaal method. Baseline data was compared between patients with and without suboptimal INR control. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables independently associated with suboptimal INR control.A total of 1,669 patients from 22 centres located across Thailand were included. The average age was 69.1 ± 10.7 years, and 921 (55.2%) were male. The mean TTR was 50.5% ± 27.5%; 1,125 (67.4%) had TTR < 65%. Univariate analysis showed hypertension, , heart failure, renal disease and SAMe-TT2R2 score to be significantly different between patients with and without optimal TTR. The SAMe-TT2R2 score was the only factor that remained statistically significant in multivariate analysis. The C-statistic for the SAMe-TT2R2 score in the prediction of suboptimal TTR was 0.54.SAMe-TT2R2 score was the only independent predictor of suboptimal TTR in NVAF patients being treated with warfarin.

This insufficiency is mostly post-ischaemic in nature, but other aetiologies are possible in this high-risk population. In patients with DT2, diabetic cardiomyopathy is a recognized cause of cardiac insufficiency secondary to chronic hyperglycaemia and myocardial lipotoxicity, which promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (and, frequently, apoptosis of these cells), interstitial fibrosis and a decrease in myocardial contractile performance. Several studies have shown that diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with modifications to the intestinal microbiota, and changes in the synthesis of bacterial metabolites and their diffusion into the host, some of which appear to have direct deleterious effects on cardiac contractility. These findings open up new perspectives for pathophysiological studies by establishing the presence of a 'microbiota-myocardium' axis and raising the possibility of innovative new treatments. Correction of intestinal dysbiosis in patients with cardiac insufficiency could, therefore, constitute an innovative therapeutic approach to cases of this disease with a poor prognosis.Copyright © 2019.

While many mouse models of  now exist, there has been little systematic effort to characterize them for timing of onset and severity of bladder dysfunction. We monitored metabolic status and tested bladder function by void spot assay and limited anesthetized cystometry in both males and females of three models of obesity and : a type 1  model (Akita mouse) and two type 2  models (Diet Induced Obesity (DIO) model, and  mouse). Akita mice had insulin pellets implanted subcutaneously every 3 months to mimic poorly controlled type 1  in humans. Mice were hyperglycemic by 48 days following implants. Female mice exhibited no bladder dysfunction at any age up to 20 months and gained weight normally. In contrast, by seven months, male Akita developed a profound polyuria and failed to show normal weight gain. There were no observable signs of bladder dysfunction in either gender. DIO mice on high/low fat diets for 16 months, exhibited mild hyperglycemia in the females (not in males), mild weight gain and no evidence of bladder dysfunction.  mice were followed for eight months and became extremely obese. Males and females were glucose intolerant, insulin intolerant and hyperinsulinemic at four months. By eight months, their metabolic status had improved but was still abnormal. Urine volume increased in males, but not in females. Bladder dysfunction was observed in the spotting patterns of females at four and six months of age, resolving by eight months. We conclude there are dramatic gender-related differences in lower urinary tract function in these models. Akita males may be a good model for polyuria-related bladder remodeling, while  females may better mimic storage problems related to loss of outlet control in a setting of type 2  complicated by obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678585>Predicting adults likely to develop heart failure using readily available clinical information.</a></h1><p>Heart failure is a heavy burden to the health care system in the United States. Once heart failure develops, the quality of life and longevity are dramatically affected. It is critical to prevent it. We evaluated the predictive ability of readily available clinical information to identify those likely to develop heart failure.We used a CART model to determine the top predictors for heart failure incidence using the NHANES Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS). The identified predictors were hypertension, , obesity, and myocardial infarction (MI). We evaluated the relationship between these variables and incident heart failure by the product-limit method and Cox models. All analyses incorporated the complex sample design to provide population estimates.We analyzed data from 14,407 adults in the NHEFS. Participants with , MI, hypertension, or obesity had a higher incidence of heart failure than those without risk factors, with  and MI being the most potent predictors. Individuals with multiple risk factors had a higher incidence of heart failure as well as a higher hazard ratio than those with just one risk factor. Combinations that included  and MI had the highest incidence rates of heart failure per 1000 person years and the highest hazard ratios for incident heart failure.Having , MI, hypertension or obesity significantly increased the risk for incident heart failure, especially combinations including  and MI. This suggests that individuals with these conditions, singly or in combination, should be prioritized in efforts to predict and prevent heart failure incidence.Copyright © 2019.

Quercetin occurs as a glycoside (with linked sugars) or as an aglycone (without linked sugars). Although quercetin has many different forms in nature, the form found in plants is quercetin-3-O-glucoside, which generally functions as a pigment that gives color to a multitude of fruits and vegetables. The recent literature has been reviewed using PubMed, Science Direct, and Embase databases. In this article, we reviewed quercetin with respect to chemical properties, absorption mechanism, metabolism, bioavailability, food sources, bioactivities, and possible health-promoting mechanisms. Quercetin is known as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and anti-obesity compound. It is thought to be beneficial against cardiovascular diseases, cancer, , neurological diseases, obesity, allergy asthma, and atopic diseases.

Farnesol (FOH) obtained from the oils of diverse plants can exhibit significant therapeutic actions against obesity, , inflammatory conditions and cancers. Here, we evaluated the potential effects of FOH on growth and metastasis and it was observed that FOH significantly abrogated cell proliferation in lung cancer cells. Moreover, FOH inhibited cell repair movement by wound healing assay and reduced cell adhesion. It suppressed the expression of mesenchymal genes such as fibronectin, vimentin, N-cadherin, twist, and snail, and increased expression of epithelial genes such as occludin and E-cadherin. It also attenuated the migration and invasion through the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, FOH inhibited the tumor growth of xenograft mouse lung cancer model, and modulated the expression of mesenchymal and epithelial markers. The results suggest that FOH may block the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and thus exhibit anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic activity against lung cancer cells.Copyright © 2019.

Treating these ulcers is difficult because of poor tissue coverage and the bony os calcis, often leading to proximal amputation. This case series shows the vertical contour calcanectomy (VCC) as a surgical alternative in functional limb salvage. Sixteen feet (14 patients) with recalcitrant heel wounds who underwent VCC were identified. The minimum follow-up time for inclusion was 1 year. Body mass index, , renal disease, peripheral vascular disease, lymphedema/venous insufficiency, smoking status, Charcot, amputation, vascular intervention, wound recurrence, reoperation rate, and ambulatory status were evaluated. The average follow-up time was 27.1 months (range 13.5 to 51.1). At 1 year of follow-up, 56% of heel wounds (9 of 16) treated with the VCC remained closed. An average of 1.44 subsequent surgeries were required per patient. Baseline or improved ambulatory status was achieved in 69% of patients (9 of 14) at 1-year follow up and 100% of patients (8 of 8) at 2-year follow up. The overall rate of major amputation was 19%. The long-term ambulatory status of patients treated with the VCC shows promise.

To search for a superior antidiabetic Ganoderma extract, five common Ganoderma species (G. lucidum, G. sinense, G. tsugae, G. applanatum, and G. leucocontextum) were investigated. A total of 10 fractions, including a total triterpenes fraction and a crude polysaccharides fraction for each, were prepared for further assays. Activities of α-glucosidase and α-amylase are inhibited dominantly by triterpenes from all five Ganoderma species rather than the polysaccharides. G. lucidum triterpenes inhibits α-glucosidase and α-amylase most significantly with IC50 values of 10.02 ± 0.95 µg/mL and 31.82 ± 4.30 µg/mL. Even more, triterpenes content was positively correlated with anti-α-glucosidase and anti-α-amylase activities. Therefore, triterpenes were considered to be the active compounds in inhibiting α-glucosidase and α-amylase activity.

However, it is unclear how the presentation of reduced sugar content on food packages affects taste expectations of consumers. Based on the learned knowledge about negative health effects of sugar and the common belief that unhealthy food tastes better than healthy food, consumers might conclude that lower sugar levels are associated with higher healthiness and lower tastiness. Addressing this concern, we examined how quantitative information about sugar content without any verbal description influences consumers' health and taste expectations of dairy desserts. We asked participants to indicate the expected healthiness and tastiness of randomly sampled dairy desserts, while varying systematically the quantitative sugar information provided in a label presented with the desserts (numerical sugar level in grams per 100 grams of product: low vs. original vs. high). We assumed that quantitative sugar content is not equally associated with healthiness and tastiness of products and that numerical information about sugar content informs health more than taste expectations. Therefore, we predicted that consumers expect higher healthiness, but not to the same degree lower tastiness for products with reduced sugar contented compared to products with higher sugar content. The results of the present study are in line with this hypothesis. We found that consumers expected desserts with less sugar to be healthier than desserts with higher levels of sugar. The experimentally varied sugar levels did not affect the tastiness expectations. Notably, consumers did not follow the unhealthy = tasty intuition and did not devaluate the tastiness of desserts because of heightened healthiness expectations. Our findings suggest that sole numerical information about sugar content-an important nutritional value-is more diagnostic in the construction of healthiness rather than tastiness expectations of food products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679516>Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis with a particular focus on subgroups.</a></h1><p>The role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear.

Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and net clinical benefit. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Subgroup analyses involving sex, concomitant statin treatment, , and smoking were performed.Thirteen randomized controlled trials comprising 164,225 patients were included. The risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was similar for aspirin and control groups (RR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93-1.02; RR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.90-1.08; respectively). Aspirin reduced the relative risk (RRR) of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 9% (RR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.95), myocardial infarction by 14% (RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.95), and ischemic stroke by 10% (RR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99), but was associated with a 46% relative risk increase of major bleeding events (RR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.30-1.64) compared with controls. Aspirin use did not translate into a net clinical benefit adjusted for event-associated mortality risk (mean 0.034%; 95% CI, - 0.18 to 0.25%). There was an interaction for aspirin effect in three patient subgroups: (i) in patients under statin treatment, aspirin was associated with a 12% RRR of MACE (RR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96), and this effect was lacking in the no-statin group; (ii) in non-smokers, aspirin was associated with a 10% RRR of MACE (RR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99), and this effect was not present in smokers; and (iii) in males, aspirin use resulted in a 11% RRR of MACE (RR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95), with a non-significant effect in females.Aspirin use does not reduce all-cause or cardiovascular mortality and results in an insufficient benefit-risk ratio for CVD primary prevention. Non-smokers, patients treated with statins, and males had the greatest risk reduction of MACE across subgroups.PROSPERO CRD42019118474.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681285>Augmented Brain Infiltration and Activation of Leukocytes After Cerebral Ischemia in Type 2 Diabetic Mice.</a></h1><p> Stroke patients with  suffer from higher mortality rate and worsened neurological outcome. However, the responses of immune system to cerebral ischemia in the setting of  remain poorly understood.  In this study, we investigated the temporal profile of leukocyte mobilization and brain infiltration following distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) in db/db mouse model of type 2  (T2D) and its db/+ normoglycemic controls.  We found a significant increase of brain-infiltrating CD4 T cell at day 3 after dMCAO, and a delayed and dramatic increase of brain-infiltrating neutrophils, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and B cells at day 7 after dMCAO in db/db mice vs. db/+ controls. Leukocyte subsets in the circulation and spleen were also measured, however, there is no significant difference between non-diabetic and diabetic groups. Furthermore, we identified an increased expression of activation marker CD69 in brain-infiltrating neutrophils, CD4 T and CD8 T cells, and IFN-γ in brain-infiltrating CD4 T cells in db/db mice at day 7 after dMCAO.  These findings for the first time demonstrate that cerebral ischemia induces a delayed and sustained augmentation of brain infiltration and activation of neutrophils and lymphocytes in type 2 diabetic mice and these altered immune responses might contribute to the severer brain tissue damage and worse neurological outcomes of  stroke, which warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Zhao, Jiang, Liu, Liu, Shi, Hao, Xu, Lo and Wang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679728>Energy balance and obesity in individuals with cystic fibrosis.</a></h1><p>This article reviews the significance of nutritional status in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and sheds light on the reasons behind the intense focus placed on perpetual weight gain and increased caloric intake by CF patients and their providers.

Recent studies have shown several unexpected pleiotropic effects of mannose including increased regulatory T cells (Tregs), prevention of auto-immune disease and ability to reduce growth of human cancer cells. We have previously shown in large cohorts that elevated serum mannose levels are associated with future development of type 2  (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. However, potential direct effects of mannose on insulin sensitivity in vivo or in vitro are unknown. We here show that administration of mannose (0.1 g/kg BW twice daily) for one week in man did not elicit negative effects on meal-modified glucose tolerance, markers of inflammation or insulin levels. Tregs number and insulin signaling in human liver cells were unchanged. These data suggest that mannose is a marker, and not a mediator, of insulin resistance. To verify this, we examined serum mannose levels during long-term euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps in non-diabetic and T2D individuals. Mannose was reduced by insulin infusion in proportion to whole-body insulin sensitivity. Thus, mannose is a biomarker of insulin resistance which may be useful for the early identification of diabetic individuals with insulin resistance and increased risk of its complications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Screening and associated management of osteoporosis is often only considered by providers when patients present with multiple fragility fractures. Current evidence with regard to the trends in screening and medical co-management/anti-osteoporotic therapy of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) remains limited.To understand trends, costs and clinical impact associated the utilization of anti-osteoporotic medication and screening with the one year following occurrences of sentinel/primary osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs).Retrospective review of 2008-2015Q3 Humana Administrative Claims (HAC) database.The 2008-2015Q3 HAC database was queried using International Classification of Diseases 9 Edition (ICD-9) diagnosis codes 805.2 and 805.4 to identify patients with primary closed osteoporotic thoracolumbar VCFs. Patients with a concurrent diagnosis of trauma and/or malignancy were excluded. Patients experiencing a fragility fracture of the hip, distal radius or proximal humerus and/or those already on osteoporotic medication within the year prior to the VCF were excluded to prevent an overlap in the screening and/or anti-resorptive medication rates. Finally, only those patients who had complete two year follow-up data were analyzed.To understand trends over time in the utilization of medication for osteoporosis and screening within one year following sentinel VCFs. The study also aimed to report per-prescription and per-patient average costs associated with different anti-osteoporotic medications. As secondary objectives, we also assessed 1) risk factors associated with not receiving anti-osteoporotic medication within the year following sentinel VCFs and 2) Differences in rates of experiencing a secondary fragility fracture of vertebrae, hip, distal radius and proximal humerus between patients who received medication following the sentinel VCF versus those who did not receive any medication.A total of 6,464 primary osteoporotic VCFs were retrieved from the database. A majority of the VCFs were seen in females (N=5,199; 80.4%). Only 28.8% (N=1,860) patients received some form of medication for osteoporosis medication in the year following the VCF. Over a six-year interval, treatment with medication for osteoporosis declined from 38% in 2008 to 24% in 2014. The average cost of anti-osteoporotic treatment per patient was $1,511. The most commonly prescribed treatment and associated average cost/patient was alendronate sodium (N=1,239; 66.6% - $120/patient). The most costly prescribed treatment was Forteo (N=177; 2.7%) with an average cost/patient of $12,074 and cost/injection being $2,373. Only 36.7% (N=2,371) received a DEXA/bone density scan in the year following the VCF with an average cost/patient of $76. Risk factors associated with no prescription of medication for osteoporosis within 1 year of VCF were male gender (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.01-1.35]; p=0.027), history of CVA/stroke (OR 1.56 [95% CI 1.08-2.32]; p=0.022), history of  (OR 1.28 [95% CI 1.04-1.58]; p=0.023). Of note, patients in the West vs. Midwest (OR 1.26 [95% CI 1.04-1.51]; p=0.016) and commercial insurance beneficiaries (OR 1.95 [95% CI 1.08-3.52]; p=0.027) were more likely to receive anti-osteoporotic medication. Patients who were placed on anti-osteoporotic medication were significantly less likely to suffer a second fragility fracture compared to patients that did not receive medication (OR 0.27 [95% CI 0.24-0.31]; p=0.033).The proportion of patients starting anti-osteoporotic medication within a year after a VCF remains low (28.8%). Furthermore, a declining trend of anti-osteoporotic medication prescription was noted over time. Providers who care for patients with sentinel VCFs need to be more diligent in their efforts to diagnose and treat the underlying osteoporosis to reduce the burden of future fragility fractures.Copyright © 2019.

Thus, transplanted islets must re-establish nutritional and physical support through formation of new blood vessels and new ECM. To promote this critical process, we developed an elastin-based vasculogenic and ECM-promoting scaffold engineered for extrahepatic islet transplantation. The scaffold by design consisted of type I collagen (Coll) blended with 20wt% of elastin (E) shown to promote angiogenesis as well as  ECM deposition. The resulting "CollE" scaffolds h ad interconnected pores with a size distribution tailored to accommodate seeding of islets as well as growth of new blood vessels. , CollE scaffolds enabled prolonged culture of murine islets for up to one week while preserving their integrity, viability and function. , after only four weeks post-transplant of a marginal islet mass, CollE scaffolds demonstrated enhanced vascularization of the transplanted islets in the epididymal fat pad and promoted a prompt reversal of hyperglycemia in previously diabetic recipients. This outcome was comparable to that of kidney capsular (KC) islet transplantation, and superior to that of islets transplanted on the control collagen-only scaffolds (Coll). Crucial genes associated with angiogenesis (VEGFA, PDGFB, FGF1, and COL3A1) as well as  islet-specific matrix deposition (COL6A1, COL4A1, LAMA2 and FN1) were all significantly upregulated in islets on CollE scaffolds in comparison to those on Coll scaffolds. Finally, CollE scaffolds were also able to support human islet culture . In conclusion, CollE scaffolds have the potential to improve the clinical outcome of marginal islet transplantation at extrahepatic sites by promoting angiogenesis and islet-specific ECM deposition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681669>Is it necessary to screen patient with adhesive capsulitis of shoulder for ?</a></h1><p>Idiopathic adhesive capsulitis of shoulder is common cause of pain and restriction of shoulder motion between the ages of 30 and 65.

Podocytes are characterized by large numbers of mitochondria. However, mitochondrial dysfunction as it relates to kidney pathology remains poorly understood. The present study found that podocyte mitochondria in different animal models of  became elongated with the development of albuminuria, suggesting a change in mitochondrial dynamics. We then treated cells with a combination of glucose, fatty acids, and angiotensin II (GFA) to mimic the diabetic milieu. Cultured podocytes exposed to GFA showed megamitochondria formation and decreased autophagosome degradation. We also found that GFA treatment decreased the binding of the autophagosome to the lysosome. Our results suggest that megamitochondria are common in podocytes during diabetic nephropathy and that insufficient autophagy flux may underlie this effect.

The involvement of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in modulating DN pathogenesis has been implied, but underlying mechanism is still lacking. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of circ_0080425 correlated with the DN progression, and exerted positive effect on cell proliferation and fibrosis in mesangial cells. Further assessment suggested that circ_0080425 function as sponge harboring miR-24-3p. Moreover, miR-24-3p negatively correlated with the DN progression, and showed an antagonistic effect to circ_0080425on regulating MCs cell proliferation and fibrosis. Bioinformatics analysis predicted fibroblast growth factor 11 (FGF11) acting as direct downstream target of miR-24-3p. Indeed, the expression of FGF11 was significantly activated by circ_0080425 while suppressed by miR-24-3p. Knockdown of FGF11 resulted in a significant reduced cell proliferation rate and fibrosis. In addition, miR-24-3p inhibitor rescued the suppression of si-circ_0080425 on FGF11, suggesting that circ_0080425 competitive binding to miR-24-3p could release FGF11 from miR-24-3p suppression, which subsequently promoted DN progression.In conclusion, we have reported a novel circ_0080425-miR-24-3p-FGF11 axis, and explored the underlying mechanism in regulating DN pathogenesis.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682189>Validation of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Diabetic Retinopathy.</a></h1><p>        ±     </p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682638>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is an early predictor of metabolic diseases in a metabolically healthy population.</a></h1><p>The relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and incident metabolic syndrome in metabolically healthy subjects is unknown.

Presently, the available drug treatments (e.g., anticonvulsants acting at calcium channels, serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, topical lidocaine, etc.) for chronic neuropathic pain patients are still rare and have disappointing efficacy, which makes it difficult to relieve the patients' painful symptoms, and, at best, they only try to reduce the patients' ability to tolerate pain. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a type of transcript of more than 200 nucleotides with no protein-coding or limited capacity, were identified to be abnormally expressed in the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglion, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex under chronic neuropathic pain conditions. Moreover, a rapidly growing body of data has clearly pointed out that nearly 40% of lncRNAs exist specifically in the nervous system. Hence, it was speculated that these dysregulated lncRNAs might participate in the occurrence, development, and progression of chronic neuropathic pain. In other words, if we deeply delve into the potential roles of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of chronic neuropathic pain, this may open up new strategies and directions for the development of novel targeted drugs to cure this refractory disorder. In this article, we primarily review the status of chronic neuropathic pain and provide a general overview of lncRNAs, the detailed roles of lncRNAs in the nervous system and its related diseases, and the abnormal expression of lncRNAs and their potential clinical applications in chronic neuropathic pain. We hope that through the above description, readers can gain a better understanding of the emerging roles of lncRNAs in chronic neuropathic pain.Copyright © 2019 Wu, Ji and Zhao.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678409>Impact of Age, Gender, Race, and Ethnicity on Mortality in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest with Psychiatric Disorder in the United States.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677909>Coronary Artery Disease Association With Arterial Calcifications on Routine Hand Radiographs.</a></h1><p>Arterial calcifications in the lower extremity, chest, and cardiac vessels have been linked to coronary artery disease (CAD).

As a member of the ATP-gated ion channel family, P2X receptor is associated with the transduction of pain signal and the onset of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dihydromyricetin (DHM) on rats with comorbid DNP and MDD. After the comorbid model was established, rat behavior changes were monitored by measuring the mechanical withdrawal threshold, thermal withdrawal latency, sugar water preference, immobility time in the forced-swim test, and open-field test parameters. The expressions of P2X receptor in the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), spinal cord, and hippocampus were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and double immunofluorescence. We found that hyperalgesia, allodynia, and depressive behaviors of rats with comorbid DNP and MDD were relieved by treatment with DHM or application of a short-hairpin RNA for P2X receptor. The expression levels of P2X, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin 1ß were increased in the DRGs, spinal cord, and hippocampus of rats in the model group but restored after DHM or P2X short-hairpin RNA treatment. In conclusion, P2X receptor in the DRGs, spinal cord, and hippocampus participates in the transduction of DNP and MDD signals. DHM seems to relieve comorbid DNP and MDD by reducing the expression of P2X receptor in the DRGs, spinal cord, and hippocampus and may be an effective new drug for the treatment of patients with both DNP and MDD.Copyright © 2019 Guan, Shen, Ge, Xiong, He, Liu, Yin, Wei and Gao.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678965>Effects of self-monitoring devices on blood pressure in older adults with hypertension and : a randomised controlled trial.</a></h1><p>Hypertension and  frequently coexist, which results in the difficulty of hypertension control in community-dwelling elderly adults who lack effective prevention and control strategies.

However, very few studies have been conducted to examine the health risks of air pollution in Indonesia, particularly for adolescents.To assess the association between long-term exposure to ambient particles with a diameter of <2.5 μm (PM) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in adolescents.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 482 adolescents aged 14-18 years in Yogyakarta, Indonesia in 2016. We finally included 469 (97.30%) participants who had no missing data for data analysis. We collected individual data on socio-demographics, behavioral habits, and health information through standardized questionnaires. Satellite-based PM concentrations from 2013 to 2016 were assigned based on participants' residential addresses. The association between PM and FPG was examined using a generalized linear regression model while FPG was modeled as a continuous variable. An ordered logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between PM and FPG categories.Every 1 μg/m³ increase in PM was associated with a 0.34 mg/dL [95 confidence interval (95% CI): 0.08 mg/dL, 0.59 mg/dL] increase in FPG levels. Comparing with the low FPG level (under 86 mg/dL), every 1 μg/m³ increase in PM was associated with a 10.20% (95% CI: 1.60%, 19.80%) increase in the odds of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (100-125 mg/dL).

We studied the prevalence and prognosis of MINOCA patients.  In the Hungarian Myocardial Infarction Registry (HUMIR) 45,223 patients (pts) with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were found who were treated between Jan 1, 2014, and June 30, 2018, and coronary arteriography was performed. ST-elevation myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 22,469 pts (49.7%). Patients without obstructive coronary artery disease who had no previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, PCI and CABG procedure were selected to the MINOCA group (n = 2003). Patients with obstructive coronary artery disease belonged to the MICAD group (n = 43,220). We investigated clinical characteristics of the patients, overall survival and reinfarction. Survival curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and were modeled with the Cox proportional hazards model.  The proportion of MINOCA pts among all myocardial infarction was by 4.4% higher in the STEMI pts compared to the NSTEMI group (2.0% vs. 6.8%). The MINOCA pts were younger (age 64.0 ± 14.4 vs. 65.5 ± 12.2 years), and the proportion of women was higher (55.7% vs. 36.5%). Hypertension,  and peripheral artery disease were more common in the MICAD group (79.1% vs. 73.7%, 33.0% vs. 21.2%, and 12% vs. 8%). The mortality was higher among the MICAD pts. In the MINOCA group, the mortality of men did not differ between STEMI and NSTEMI, as opposed to women: women with STEMI had higher mortality than women with NSTEMI. The risk of reinfarction was higher in the MICAD group, especially in NSTEMI, the risk in the MINOCA group was lower, and there was no substantial difference between types.  In this real word, retrospective, observational study, we found a significant difference in the prevalence of MINOCA pts according to different types of myocardial infarction. In the MINOCA group, the mortality of women with STEMI was substantially higher.

However, the achievement of therapeutic targets after educational programs has been poorly evaluated.Evaluate the effectiveness of a structured and individualised education program for type 2 , provided by a primary care nurse, which featured educational reinforcements and family support to achieve metabolic control, and long-term therapeutic targets.Randomised controlled clinical trial with two arms: Intervention and control group. The intervention consisted of six face-to-face sessions of 30 min and follow-ups after 12 and 24 months for 236 participants with type 2  in a primary care setting in Andalusia (Spain). The primary outcome variables were the values and achievement of the type 2  control targets established by the American  Association: Glycated haemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The secondary outcome variable was body mass index.From an overall total of 236 participants, 54.2% were male and the average age was 65.1 ± 9.5. After 12 months, the glycated haemoglobin level and systolic blood pressure decreased in the intervention group. After 24 months, the following variables significantly improved among the intervention group participants: basal glycemia, glycated haemoglobin, total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure. The glycated haemoglobin target (<7%) was better achieved in the intervention group than in the control group (35.2% vs 24.7%, p < 0.003). The rest of the targets were not met.Continual  education with reinforcement sessions provided by a nurse achieved reductions in glycated haemoglobin, basal glycaemia, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and systolic blood pressure in both the medium and long term. It also increased the proportion of participants who achieved the therapeutic target of glycated haemoglobin.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a mega protein complex that promotes energy-consuming anabolic processes of protein and nucleic acid synthesis as well lipogenesis in times of energy and nutrient abundance. However, it is best characterized as the regulator of steps leading to protein synthesis. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic system (UPS) is a major intracellular proteolytic system whose activity is increased during periods of nutrient scarcity and in muscle wasting conditions such as cachexia. Recent studies have examined the impact of mTORC1 on levels and functions of the 26S proteasome, the mega protease complex of the UPS. Here we first briefly review current understanding of the regulation of mTORC1, the UPS, and the 26S proteasome complex. We then review evidence of the effect of each complex on the abundance and functions of the other. Given the fact that drugs that inhibit either complex are either in clinical trials or are approved for treatment of cancer, a muscle wasting condition, we identify studying the effect of combinatory mTORC1-proteasome inhibition on skeletal muscle mass and health as a critical area requiring investigation.Copyright © 2019.

This study aims to explore, for the first time, the association of the GSK3β rs334558 and rs6438552 polymorphisms with CRC.Genomic DNA from 330 CRC patients and healthy blood donors were analyzed. Identification of polymorphisms was made by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methodology. Association was calculated by the odds ratio (OR) test.Patients carrying the C/T genotype for the rs334558 (T>C) polymorphism showed an increased risk for CRC (OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.05-2.79, P = 0.039); this association was also observed for TNM stage and tumor location. For the rs6438552 (T>C) polymorphism, the OR analysis showed that patients carrying C/T and C/C genotypes have a decreased risk for CRC (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.27-0.70, P = 0.001 and OR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.10-0.64, P = 0.001, respectively); this decreased risk was also evident in the stratified analysis by TNM stage and tumor location. Haplotype analysis of these 2 loci of GSK3β (rs334558 and rs6438552) showed differential distribution. The T-T and C-C haplotype was associated with a decreased risk of CRC, while the T-C haplotype was associated with an increased risk of CRC.Our results denote that GSK3β gene polymorphisms play a significant role in promoting or preventing CRC. Additionally, variations in this gene are associated with the tumor site and the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage in these patients.© 2019 The Author(s).

Maillard reaction products are also known to cause oxidation of tissues and inflammation, thus increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and . The aim of this review is to present a detailed information about the role of foodborne constituents as antibrowning agents to significantly reduce the harmful compounds like advanced glycation end products (AGEs) during food processing. This review includes strategies involving addition of amino acids, aromatic compounds, vitamins, modification of amino acids, and reducing sugars as antibrowning agents to reduce the AGEs. The role of Food borne functional ingredients such as catechin, epicathechin, luteolin, and ferulic acids as inhibitors of AGEs is also discussed. Among the naturally occurring inhibitors, genistein could be a crucial and safe agent to reduce reactive intermediates. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Maillard reaction leads to changes in food color, protein functionality, protein digestibility, and loss of nutrient from foods. Maillard reaction products (MRPs) is also reported to be associated with various inflammatory conditions and may contribute to the progress of chronic diseases, including . It is hence necessary to reduce the MRPs, in both food and biological products, to offset this phenomenon. Among the strategies adopted till date, chemical agents could inhibit reactive carbonyl species and reactive oxygen species, but also are known to elicit serious side effects. Dietary flavonoids could be a very good inhibitor of MRPs both in biological and in food systems. It could be suggested that dietary flavonoids and isoflavones can be used as antibrowning agents in food and pharmaceutical industries particularly for targeted and sustained release of hypoglycemic drug in the intestines.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679189>Dendrimers for Therapeutic Delivery: Compositions, Characterizations, and Current Status.</a></h1><p>Dendrimers, commonly referred to as arborols, offer tremendous opportunities for drug delivery, diagnostics, and treatment applications.

This study used a murine model to test the hypothesis that intravitreal injection of human CD34  stem cells harvested from bone marrow (BMSCs) can have protective effects in eyes with diabetic retinopathy. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice (C57BL/6J) were used as a model for diabetic retinopathy. Subcutaneous implantation of Alzet pump, loaded with Tacrolimus and Rapamycin, 5 days prior to intravitreal injection provided continuous systemic immunosuppression for the study duration to avoid rejection of human cells. Human CD34  BMSCs were harvested from the mononuclear cell fraction of bone marrow from a healthy donor using magnetic beads. The CD34  cells were labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) using a lentiviral vector. The right eye of each mouse received an intravitreal injection of 50,000 EGFP-labeled CD34  BMSCs or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Simultaneous multimodal in vivo retinal imaging system consisting of fluorescent scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (enabling fluorescein angiography), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography was used to confirm the development of diabetic retinopathy and study the in vivo migration of the EGFP-labeled CD34  BMSCs in the vitreous and retina following intravitreal injection. After imaging, the mice were euthanized, and the eyes were removed for immunohistochemistry. In addition, microarray analysis of the retina and retinal flat mount analysis of retinal vasculature were performed. The development of retinal microvascular changes consistent with diabetic retinopathy was visualized using fluorescein angiography and OCT angiography between 5 and 6 months after induction of  in all diabetic mice. These retinal microvascular changes include areas of capillary nonperfusion and late leakage of fluorescein dye. Multimodal in vivo imaging and immunohistochemistry identified EGFP-labeled cells in the superficial retina and along retinal vasculature at 1 and 4 weeks following intravitreal cell injection. Microarray analysis showed changes in expression of 162 murine retinal genes following intravitreal CD34  BMSC injection when compared to PBS-injected control. The major molecular pathways affected by intravitreal CD34  BMSC injection in the murine retina included pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy including Toll-like receptor, MAP kinase, oxidative stress, cellular development, assembly and organization pathways. At 4 weeks following intravitreal injection, retinal flat mount analysis showed preservation of the retinal vasculature in eyes injected with CD34  BMSCs when compared to PBS-injected control. The study findings support the hypothesis that intravitreal injection of human CD34  BMSCs results in retinal homing and integration of these human cells with preservation of the retinal vasculature in murine eyes with diabetic retinopathy.Copyright © 2019.

To evaluate the anti-diabetic effects of insoluble- (BIF) and soluble fibers (BSF) enzymatically isolated from barley, a conventional rat model and a type 2  rat model were used. Our results showed that 4-week treatment of BIF or BSF effectively reduced FBG in the diabetic condition, with caecal level of propionic acid and minor SCFAs increased by BIF and that of butyric acid and insulin sensitivity improved by BSF, respectively. The two treatments further ameliorated liver function, judged by the recovered serum level of ALT, albumin and total protein levels. BIF and BSF also increased HDL-C and decreased serum MDA. In normal rats, BIF and BSF showed a hypolipidaemic effect in triglycerides and LDL-C, reduced body weight and enhanced the caecal production of minor SCFAs. Furthermore, the two treatments reduced the caecal level of butyric acid while BSF increased that of propionic acid. In conclusion, BIF could exert anti-diabetic effects that might via a different mechanism from BSF.Copyright © 2019.

Furthermore, most people with type 2  are either obese or overweight, with the associated dyslipidaemia contributing to the development of insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk. Here we incubated INS-1 pancreatic β-cells for 72h in RPMI-1640 media, or media supplemented with 28mM glucose, 200µM palmitic acid, and 200µM oleic acid as a cellular model of diabetic glucolipotoxicity. Illumina HiSeq gene expression analysis showed the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) family to be among the most highly downregulated by glucolipotoxicity. Importantly, MetaCore integrated knowledge database, from Clarivate Analytics, indicated potential TAAR impact on insulin secretion through adenylyl cyclase signalling pathways. We therefore investigated the effect of TAAR ligands on cAMP signalling and insulin secretion, and found that only the branch of the TAAR family tree that is activated by isopentylamine, 2-phenylethylamine, p-tyramine, and agmatine significantly increased intracellular cAMP and resulted in increased insulin secretion from INS-1 cells and primary mouse islets under normal conditions. Crucially however, this enhancement was not evident when the receptor family was downregulated by glucolipotoxic conditions. This data indicates that a subset of TAARs are regulators of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, and that their downregulation contributes to glucolipotoxic inhibition of insulin secretion. As such they may be potential targets for treatment of type 2 .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Newer studies have reported a much lower incidence of infections in "low-risk" elective, outpatient, laparoscopic cholecystectomies. We investigated the current rate of postoperative infections in these cases within a large, U.S.We retrospectively reviewed elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies from the 2016-2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Our primary outcome was postoperative surgical site infection; secondary was Clostridium difficile infection. Logistic models evaluated the associations of patient and operation characteristics with these outcomes.Surgical infection occurred in 1.0% of cases (293/30,579). Cdifficile infection occurred in 0.1% (31 cases). In our adjusted multivariable models, other/unknown race/ethnicity, , hypertension, smoking, American Society of Anesthesiologists >2, operative minutes, and wound class 4 were associated with a significantly higher odds of surgical infection; no covariates were significantly associated with Cdifficile infection.In the setting of modern U.S. surgical practice, the incidence of infection after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is very low, on par with clean cases. Our study identified several patient characteristics that were strongly associated with surgical infection. Many of these are not included as risk factors in current guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis and may help to identify those at higher risk for this rare complication.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Yet some advocate ingesting only whole-grain foods (WGFs) and avoiding all refined-grain foods (RGFs). Some even recommend avoiding all grain-based foods (GBFs). This article will provide arguments to counter negative deductions about GBFs and RGFs, especially staple ones, and to support dietary guidance recommending a balance of GBFs-achieved through the right mix, type, and quantity of WGFs and RGFs. Studies looking at early mortality, body weight, and glucose tolerance and  will be used as examples to characterize the literature about GBFs. The following issues are highlighted: 1) inconsistent findings between epidemiological and interventional studies and impacts of GBFs on health outcomes, and the underreporting of findings showing RGFs neither raise nor lower health risks; 2) multiple confounding and potential interactions make adequate statistical adjustment difficult; 3) nonuniform WGF definitions among studies make comparison of results challenging, especially because some WGFs may contain 49-74% refined grain (RG); 4) binary categorization of GBFs creates bias because nearly all categories of WGFs are recommended, but nearly half the RGF categories are not; 5) ingestion of >5 (30-g) servings RGFs/d and <1 serving WFGs/d creates dietary imbalance; 6) pattern names (e.g., "white bread") may impugn RGFs, when names such as "unbalanced" or "few fruits and vegetables" may more fairly characterize the dietary imbalance; 7) avoidance of all enriched RGs may not only impair status of folate and other B vitamins and certain minerals such as iron and zinc but also decrease acceptability of WGFs; 8) extrapolation beyond median documented intakes in high-WGF consumers (∼48 g whole grain/d) in most cohorts is speculative; 9) recommended dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet demonstrate that the right mix of WGFs and RGFs contributes to positive health outcomes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679767>Integrative analysis of prognostic biomarkers derived from multiomics panels helps discrimination of chronic kidney disease trajectories in people with type 2 .</a></h1><p>Clinical risk factors explain only a fraction of the variability of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline in people with type 2 . Cross-omics technologies by virtue of a wide spectrum screening of plasma samples have the potential to identify biomarkers for the refinement of prognosis in addition to clinical variables. Here we utilized proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics panel assay measurements in baseline plasma samples from the multinational PROVALID study (PROspective cohort study in patients with type 2  for VALIDation of biomarkers) of patients with incident or early chronic kidney disease (median follow-up 35 months, median baseline eGFR 84 mL/min/1.73 m, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 8.1 mg/g). In an accelerated case-control study, 258 individuals with a stable eGFR course (median eGFR change 0.1 mL/min/year) were compared to 223 individuals with a rapid eGFR decline (median eGFR decline -6.75 mL/min/year) using Bayesian multivariable logistic regression models to assess the discrimination of eGFR trajectories. The analysis included 402 candidate predictors and showed two protein markers (KIM-1, NTproBNP) to be relevant predictors of the eGFR trajectory with baseline eGFR being an important clinical covariate. The inclusion of metabolomic and lipidomic platforms did not improve discrimination substantially. Predictions using all available variables were statistically indistinguishable from predictions using only KIM-1 and baseline eGFR (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.63). Thus, the discrimination of eGFR trajectories in patients with incident or early diabetic kidney disease and maintained baseline eGFR was modest and the protein marker KIM-1 was the most important predictor.Copyright © 2019 International Society of Nephrology.

The transcription factor 7-like 2 () gene product TCF4 is a transcription factor that acts as a downstream effector in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and may be important in the development of both type 2  and renal development and disease. It is, therefore, plausible that mutations in this gene could manifest themselves in reduced kidney function or kidney disease through their effects on hyperglycemia as well as independent of this mechanism. The  gene encodes the plasma membrane calcium ATPase isoform 1, which removes bivalent calcium ions from eukaryotic cells against very large concentration gradients and is responsible for controlling the contraction and dilation of vascular smooth muscles.The aims of this study are (1) to evaluate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TCF7L2 gene as cardiovascular risk predictors in CKD and (2) to evaluate SNPs of ATP2B1 gene as cardiovascular risk predictors in CKD.Fifty clinically diagnosed CKD patients in the age group between 20 and 60 years of both genders were selected as cases and fifty healthy participants from the master health checkup department were selected as controls. Genomic DNA was extracted based on the spin column kit method. The DNA samples were stored at -20°C until analysis. Genotyping for TCF7L2 gene rs7903146 (C/T) and ATP2B1 gene rs11105354 (A/G) was carried out through polymerase chain reaction.T allele frequency was observed in 12 controls and 23 cases (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-4.7). CC genotype was observed in 38 controls and 27 cases and CT genotype in 22 cases and 12 controls. A allele was found in 38 cases and 23 controls (OR = 2, 95% CI: 1.1-3.8).

We aim to validate new Sepsis-3 guidelines in acute hepatobiliary infection.A prospective cohort of patients admitted with acute hepatobiliary infection from the emergency department from July 2016 to June 2017 was studied. The Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, SOFA and qSOFA scores were calculated and predictive performance evaluated with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves for predictive ability of these indices for critical care unit admission and morbidity.124 patients with a median age of 64.5 years and majority males (n=75, 60.5%) were admitted with acute hepatobiliary infection during the study period. Acute cholecystitis was the most common admission diagnosis (n=83, 66.9%) and most patients were managed in general ward (n=91, 73.3%) with median length of stay of 6 days (range 1-40). On multivariate analysis,  (p=0.003) predicted high dependency unit (HDU) admission while age (p=0.001), blood culture (p=0.012), fluid culture (p=0.015) and SOFA score (p=0.002) predicted length of hospital stay. The sensitivity of SIRS in predicting HDU admission (60% vs. 4%), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (62.5% vs. 0%) and morbidity (66.7% vs. 0%) was higher than qSOFA score. The specificity of qSOFA in predicting HDU admission (100% vs. 49.5%), ICU admission (99.1% vs. 53.3%) and morbidity (99.2% vs. 47.9%) was higher than SIRS criteria.The SIRS criteria has high sensitivity and the qSOFA score has high specificity in predicting outcomes of patients with acute hepatobiliary infection.Copyright © 2019.

The pathogenesis of brain impairment caused by chronic hyperglycemia is complex and includes mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, neurotransmitters' alteration, and vascular disease, which lead to cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, loss of synaptic plasticity, brain aging, and dementia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a gut released hormone, is attracting attention as a possible link between metabolic and brain impairment. Several studies have shown the influence of GPL-1 on neuronal functions such as thermogenesis, blood pressure control, neurogenesis, neurodegeneration, retinal repair, and energy homeostasis. Moreover, modulation of GLP-1 activity can influence amyloid β peptide aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dopamine (DA) levels in Parkinson's disease (PD). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) showed beneficial actions on brain ischemia in animal models, such as the reduction of cerebral infarct area and the improvement of neurological deficit, acting mainly through inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. They might also exert a beneficial effect on the cognitive impairment induced by  or obesity improving learning and memory by modulating synaptic plasticity. Moreover, GLP-1RAs reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration. Besides this, there are growing evidences on neuroprotective effects of these agonists in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, regardless of . In PD animal models, GPL-1RAs were able to protect motor activity and dopaminergic neurons whereas in AD models, they seemed to improve nearly all neuropathological features and cognitive functions. Although further clinical studies of GPL-1RAs in humans are needed, they seem to be a promising therapy for -associated cognitive decline.Copyright © 2019 Grieco, Giorgi, Gentile, d’Erme, Morano, Maras and Filardi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680088>Inhibition of mouse embryonic stem cell proliferation and induction of differentiation by natural products isolated from Rhazya stricta Decne.</a></h1><p>Embryonic stem cells provide an ideal system to study various therapies for serious human diseases such as juvenile , neurodegenerative diseases, heart diseases and cancer. Synthetic or natural compounds that affect cell proliferation and/or differentiation of embryonic stem cells are of great value. Focus of the current project was upon the isolation and evaluation of natural components from a medicinal plant; Rhazya stricta on proliferation/ differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells. For this purpose, after a series of fractionation and purification steps, 7 compounds named as RS1-RS7 were isolated from aerial parts of the plant. The effects of these compounds were evaluated on the morphology and rate of cell proliferation of mouse naive embryonic stem cells. Only RS7 inhibited the proliferation of cell and reduced the induction of differentiation of cell. The qPCR analysis confirmed that the expression of the selected pluripotency markers (Oct4, Nanog and Sox2) was down regulated by RS7 treatment as compared to control. Furthermore, upon withdraw of Leukemia inhibitory factor (lif) from medium; effect of RS7 to promote differentiation was enhanced. Through structure elucidation studies, RS7 was found to be ursolic acid. This study first time shows the effect of natural compounds of Rhazya stricta Decne. on mouse embryonic stem cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677819>CRN2 binds to TIMP4 and MMP14 and promotes perivascular invasion of glioblastoma cells.</a></h1><p>CRN2 is an actin filament binding protein involved in the regulation of various cellular processes including cell migration and invasion. CRN2 has been implicated in the malignant progression of different types of human cancer. We used CRN2 knock-out mice for analyses as well as for crossbreeding with a Tp53/Pten knock-out glioblastoma mouse model. CRN2 knock-out mice were subjected to a phenotyping screen at the German Mouse Clinic. Murine glioblastoma tissue specimens as well as cultured murine brain slices and glioblastoma cell lines were investigated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and cell biological experiments. Protein interactions were studied by immunoprecipitation, pull-down, and enzyme activity assays. CRN2 knock-out mice displayed neurological and behavioural alterations, e.g. reduced hearing sensitivity, reduced acoustic startle response, hypoactivity, and less frequent urination. While glioblastoma mice with or without the additional CRN2 knock-out allele exhibited no significant difference in their survival rates, the increased levels of CRN2 in transplanted glioblastoma cells caused a higher tumour cell encasement of murine brain slice capillaries. We identified two important factors of the tumour microenvironment, the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 4 (TIMP4) and the matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14, synonym: MT1-MMP), as novel binding partners of CRN2. All three proteins mutually interacted and co-localised at the front of lamellipodia, and CRN2 was newly detected in exosomes. On the functional level, we demonstrate that CRN2 increased the secretion of TIMP4 as well as the catalytic activity of MMP14. Our results imply that CRN2 represents a pro-invasive effector within the tumour cell microenvironment of glioblastoma multiforme.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH..

It has been documented to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory actions. Our objective was to delineate the protective effect and the underlying mechanism of Saxa-in comparison with Dexamethasone (Dexa) - in airway inflammation induced by ovalbumin (OVA) in mice.Mice were OVA-sensitized and challenged for the induction of acute asthma. Mice were orally administrated Saxa or Dexa. Total and differential cell counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total protein concentrations were assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), reduced glutathione (GSH), and total nitrate/nitrite products (NOx) levels as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissues were measured. Histopathological examination of the lung specimens was carried out using the hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining.Histopathological examination revealed that both Saxa and Dexa ameliorated OVA-induced inflammatory changes and significantly reduced total and differential leukocyte counts, LDH and total protein level in BALF upon comparison with OVA group. In addition, both treatments significantly mitigated OVA-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by diminished lung NOx level and MPO activity and elevated GSH level. The elevation of TLR4 and NF-kB levels in lung tissue were ameliorated by Saxa and Dexa administration.Saxa had marked antiasthmatic effect in OVA-induced allergic asthma through modulation of TLR4 and NF-κB signaling. Also, Saxa may represent a promising therapeutic agent for acute allergic asthma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Our objective was to assess the longitudinal associations of soluble CD163 (sCD163), a novel biomarker of ATM activation, with insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and dysglycemia in high-risk subjects.Adults at-risk for type 2  in PROMISE had three assessments over 6 years (n=408). sCD163 was measured using fasting serum. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by HOMA2-%S and the Matsuda index (ISI). β-cell function was determined by insulinogenic index (IGI) over HOMA-IR and ISSI-2. Incident dysglycemia was defined as the onset of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 . Generalized estimating equations (GEE) evaluated longitudinal associations of sCD163 with insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and incident dysglycemia adjusting for demographic and lifestyle covariates. Areas under receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AROC) tested whether sCD163 improved dysglycemia prediction in a clinical model.Longitudinal analyses showed significant inverse associations between sCD163 and insulin sensitivity (% difference per SD increase of sCD163 for HOMA2-%S (β=-7.01, 95% CI -12.26 to -1.44) and ISI (β=-7.60, 95% CI -11.09 to -3.97) and β-cell function (ISSI-2 (β=-4.67, 95 %CI -8.59 to -0.58) and IGI/HOMA-IR (β=-8.75, 95% CI -15.42 to -1.56)). Increased sCD163 was associated with greater risk for incident dysglycemia (OR=1.04, 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.06 p<0.001). sCD163 added to a model with clinical variables improved prediction of incident dysglycemia (AROC=0.6731 vs 0.638, p<0.05).sCD163 was longitudinally associated with core disorders that precede the onset of type 2 .© Endocrine Society 2019.

These results may serve as a preliminary assessment to guide future research.Between January and October 2014, stool and blood samples were collected from 53 adult T1DM patients and 53 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes levels were assessed from stool sample DNA and TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels were analyzed via qPCR using RNA from EDTA blood samples from both patients and healthy controls.The amounts of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were statistically significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the T1DM group than in the healthy control group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios in patients with T1DM were significantly lower than in healthy controls. The TLR4 and TLR2 gene expression levels in T1DM patients were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively, compared to those in the control group.Our data are the first to show a relationship between T1DM and gut microbiota in our country. In addition, our results provide information about the connections between T1DM, gut microbiota, and TLR2 and TLR4 expression.

However, metformin safety in elderly individuals is unknown. The aim of this study was to identify frequency and risk factors of lactic acid (LA) elevation in ambulatory elderly male US veterans with stable diabetic CKD3 treated with metformin. We studied 92 patients with non-diabetic CKD3 (Group1), diabetic CKD3 not on metformin (Group2) and diabetic CKD3 on metformin (Group 3). Mean LA levels were similar at 1.3 ± 0.3 and 1.3 ± 0.4 mmol/L in Groups 1 and 2, respectively; while, LA was significantly higher in Group 3 (2.1 ± 1.0 mmol/L, P < .001). Only 1 patient in each Groups 1 (4%) and 2 (4%) had hyperlactatemia (LA > 2.0 mmol/L), as compared with 17 (42.5%) patients in Group 3 (P < .05). No differences in age, BMI, eGFR, metformin dosage, and HbA1c were seen in Group 3 patients with and without hyperlactatemia. In the multivariate logistic regression analyses, metformin use was the only factor significantly associated with hyperlactatemia (adjusted OR 25.48, P < .005).

GCK, HNF1A, and HNF4A genes are among the most common genes affected. Expression of these genes in the key organs for defense against hypoglycemia and their participation in counter-regulation to hypoglycemia may potentially put individuals with a heterozygous mutation in these genes at increased risk for hypoglycemia. In HNF4A-MODY and HNF1A-MODY patients, normal or even increased insulin sensitivity together with glucose-independent mechanism of action of the first-line therapy - sulphonylurea derivatives - often leads to hypoglycemia, even at the much lower dose used in type 2 .

Methods The sonographic fetal thymus size was measured retrospectively in 105 pregnancies with maternal HIV infection and in 615 uncomplicated singleton pregnancies. The anteroposterior thymic and the intrathoracic mediastinal diameter were determined in the three-vessel view and their quotient, the thymic-thoracic ratio (TT ratio), was calculated. The study group was subdivided into three groups by the maternal viral load on the date of ultrasound (<50 cop./mL, 50-1000 cop./mL, >1000 cop./mL). Furthermore, an association between prognostic factors of the HIV infection such as the lymphocyte count, CD4/CD8 ratio, HIV medication and the thymus size, was investigated using correlation analyses. Results Fetal thymus size in pregnancies of HIV-positive mothers showed to be noticeably larger than in uncomplicated pregnancies. The mean TT ratio in the HIV-positive group was 0.389 and in the control group 0.345 (P < 0.001). There was no association between any maternal HIV parameter or medication and the size of the thymus gland. Conclusion Maternal HIV infection was associated with an increased fetal thymus size.

Therefore, and despite the noted health benefits, many individuals with T1D do not exercise as much as their healthy peers. While technology advances have improved glucose control during and immediately after exercise, it remains one of the key limitations of artificial pancreas (AP) systems, largely because stopping insulin at the onset of exercise may not be enough to prevent impending, exercise-induced hypoglycemia.A hybrid AP algorithm with subject-specific exercise behavior recognition and anticipatory action is designed to prevent hypoglycemic events during and after moderate-intensity exercise. Our approach relies on a number of key innovations, namely, an activity informed premeal bolus calculator, personalized exercise pattern recognition, and a multistage model predictive control (MS-MPC) strategy that can transition between reactive and anticipatory modes. This AP design was evaluated on 100 in silico subjects from the most up-to-date FDA-accepted UVA/Padova metabolic simulator, emulating an outpatient clinical trial setting. Results with a baseline controller, a regular MPC (rMPC), are also included for comparison purposes.In silico experiments reveal that the proposed MS-MPC strategy markedly reduces the number of exercise-related hypoglycemic events (8 vs 68).An anticipatory mode for insulin administration of a monohormonal AP controller reduces the occurrence of hypoglycemia during moderate-intensity exercise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680138>Shotgun lipidomics discovered diurnal regulation of lipid metabolism linked to insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic men.</a></h1><p>Meal timing affects metabolic homeostasis and body weight, but how composition and timing of meals affect plasma lipidomics in humans is not well studied.We used high throughput shotgun plasma lipidomics to investigate effects of timing of carbohydrate and fat intake on lipid metabolism and its relation to glycaemic control.29 non-diabetic men consumed (i) a high-carb test meal (MTT-HC) at 09:00 and a high-fat meal (MTT-HF) at 15:40; or (ii) MTT-HF at 09:00 and MTT-HC at 15:40. Blood was sampled before and 180 min after completion of each MTT. Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) was collected after overnight fast and both MTTs. Prior to each investigation day, participants consumed a 4-week isocaloric diet of the same composition: (1) high-carb meals until 13:30 and high-fat meals between 16:30 and 22:00 or (2) the inverse order.12h-daily lipid patterns showed a complex regulation by both the time of day (67.8%) and meal composition (55.4%). A third of lipids showed a diurnal variation in postprandial responses to the same meal with mostly higher responses in the morning than in the afternoon. Triacylglycerols containing shorter and more saturated fatty acids were enriched in the morning. SAT transcripts involved in fatty acid synthesis and desaturation showed no diurnal variation. Diurnal changes of seven lipid classes were negatively associated with insulin sensitivity, but not with glucose and insulin response or insulin secretion.This study identified postprandial plasma lipid profiles as being strongly affected by meal timing and associated with insulin sensitivity.© Endocrine Society 2019.

We tested the hypothesis that, apart from high plasma cholesterol, APOE ε4 carriers may also have higher advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and total soluble extracellular domain of RAGE (sRAGE) and that these biomarkers may be modified by the common Gly82Ser (G82S) polymorphism (rs2070600) in the RAGE gene. To test this, we measured these biomarkers in 172 healthy cognitively normal individuals, of which 32 were APOE ε4 carriers and 140 non-carriers. APOE ε4 carriers showed higher levels of cholesterol (p< 0.001), glyoxal (p< 0.001), fluorescent AGEs (p< 0.001), Nε-carboxymethyllysine (p< 0.001) and sRAGE (p= 0.018) when compared to non-carriers. Furthermore, sRAGE was also higher in those that did not carry the A allele of the RAGE gene that codes for serine instead of glycine (p = 0.034). Our study indicates that APOE ε4 carriers have a greater propensity to glycation than non-carriers which may further increase their risk for  and dementia. The increased sRAGE levels in APOE ε4 carriers suggests a defensive response against AGEs that may be further influenced by the RAGE G82S polymorphism.© The Author(s) 2019.
