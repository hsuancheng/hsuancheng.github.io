Juzep (Alismaceae), a Chinese herbal medicine that has been used to treat , diabetes, hypertension, dysuria, and inflammation. In this study, a sensitive and reliable method based on an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) couple with two ionisation modes, including electrospray ionisation (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS), namely, UPLC-ESI/APCI-MS/MS was developed and validated to simultaneously determine 8 triterpenoids (ESI mode) and 2 sesquiterpenoids (APCI mode) in RA. Ten marker compounds were analysed with a Waters' CORTECS UPLC C18 column (200 mm × 2.1 m, 1.6 m) and gradient elution with water (contained 0.1% formic) and acetonitrile within 7 min. The established method was validated for linearity, intra- and interday precisions, accuracy, recovery, and stability. The calibration curve for 10 marker compounds showed good linear regression ( > 0.9971). The limits of detection and quantification for analytes were 0.14-1.67 ng/mL and 0.44-.65 ng/mL, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSD, %) and accuracy (RE, %) of intra- and interday precisions were less than 3.83% and 1.21% and 3.22% and 1.46%, repeatability and stability for real samples were less than 2.78% and 3.19%, respectively. All recoveries of the 10 marker compounds ranged from 97.24% to 102.49% with RSDs less than 4.05%. The developed method efficiently determined the 10 marker compounds in RA and was subsequently applied to optimise harvest time and crude processing temperature. The result indicated the 90% wilted phase and 70°C (or lower) may be the best harvest time and the processing temperature of RA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31219455>Age should be considered in cut-off values for increased carotid intima-media thickness.</a></h1><p>The current guidelines use a cut-off value of 0.9 mm to define abnormally increased carotid intima-media thickness (C-IMT), regardless of age or gender. This study was conducted to examine the effects of age and gender on C-IMT and cut-off values for C-IMT in different age groups.A total of 644 patients with a recorded C-IMT measurement, at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor, and aged between 20 and 90 years were included in the study. Common and internal C-IMT (CC-IMT and IC-IMT) measurements were obtained using carotid ultrasonography (USG). The patients were divided into  groups based on age: Group I (20-40 years), Group II (41-50 years), Group III (51-60 years), Group IV (61-70 years), and Group V (>70 years).The CC-IMT and IC-IMT values were significantly greater as the age of the group increased. Group I to Group V had a median CC-IMT value of 0.70 mm, 0.70 mm, 0.75 mm, 0.75 mm, and 0.85 mm, respectively. The median IC-IMT value for each group was 0.60 mm, 0.65 mm, 0.70 mm, 0.70 mm, and 0.80 mm, respectively. The median CC-IMT value was 50 μm greater than the median IC-IMT value in all groups. Only the CC-IMT value was significantly different in males (0.80+-0.20 mm vs. 0.76+-0.19 mm; p=0.020). Age, hypertension (HT), smoking, , systolic-diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index measures were associated with increased C-IMT. Regression analysis revealed that increased C-IMT was independently associated with age and HT presence. Each decade of life and the presence of HT revealed an incidence of increased C-IMT by 44% and 53%, respectively.C-IMT significantly increased with age. New, age-appropriate cut-off values are needed for C-IMT assessment. In addition, it was observed that the CC-IMT value was approximately 50 μm greater than the IC-IMT measurement in all age groups. CC-IMT measurements should be included in USG reports.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469869>Association of iron deficiency anemia with tuberculosis in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based study.</a></h1><p>Iron deficiency is associated with decreased cellular immunity, which may predispose patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) to increased risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). This study investigated the relationship between newly diagnosed IDA and TB infection in Taiwan.The study included data on 21,946 patients with incident IDA and 87,555 non-IDA controls from a national database covering the period 2000-2012. IDA and non-IDA subjects were matched 1:4 on age, gender, and index year. The follow-up period was defined as the time from the initial IDA diagnosis to the date of developing TB or 31 December 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with the control group as the reference.The adjusted hazard ratio of TB for the IDA group was 1.99 (95% confidence interval, 1.77-2.25) compared with the control group. The subgroup analysis showed that for both genders, all age groups, and patients with diabetes mellitus, , hypertension, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hepatitis B virus infection, the IDA group had significantly higher TB incidence. The association was significantly stronger within the  years after new IDA diagnosis for both genders and all age groups.Higher TB incidence was discovered in the IDA group, especially for patients with comorbidities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579461>The impact of cigarette smoking on infarct location and in-hospital outcome following acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction.</a></h1><p> Smoking, which is a major modifiable risk factor for coronary artery diseases, affects cardiovascular system with different mechanisms. We designed this study to investigate the association of smoking with location of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and short-term outcomes during hospitalization.  In 1017 consecutive patients with anterior/inferior STEMI, comprehensive demographic, biochemical data, as well as clinical complications and mortality rate, were recorded. Patients were allocated into two groups based on smoking status and compared regarding the location of myocardial infarction, the emergence of clinical complications and in-hospital mortality in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Among 1017 patients, 300 patients (29.%) were smoker and 717 patients (70. %) were non-smoker. Smokers were significantly younger and had lower prevalence of diabetes,  and hypertension. Inferior myocardial infarction was considerably more common in smokers than in non-smokers (45.7% vs. 36%,  = 0.001). Heart failure was developed more commonly in non-smokers (33.9% vs. 20%,  = 0.001). In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in smokers (6.7% vs. 17.3%,  = 0.001). After adjustment for confounding variables, smoking was independently associated with inferior myocardial infarction and lower heart failure [odds ratio: 1.44 (1.06-1.96),  = 0.01 and odds ratio: 0.61 (0.40-0.92),  = 0.02, respectively]. However, in-hospital mortality was not associated with smoking after adjustment for other factors [odds ratio: 0.69 (0.36-1.31),  = 0.2].  Smoking is independently associated with inferior myocardial infarction. Although smokers had lower incidence of heart failure, in-hospital mortality was not different after adjustment for other factors.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443662>Congenital nephrotic syndrome associated with 22q11.2 duplication syndrome in a Chinese family and functional analysis of the intronic NPHS1 c. 3286 + 5G > A mutation.</a></h1><p>Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS), which is defined as heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia,  and edema, is most caused by monogenic defects in structural proteins of the glomerular filtration barrier in the kidneys. 22q11.2 duplication syndrome was a chromosomal disease with variable clinical featuresranging from normal to mental retardation and with congenital defects. Co-occurrence of two genetic disorders in a single patient is rare.The proband was born at 36 weeks of gestational age spontaneously and weighed 2350 g at birth. Six days after birth, the proband was admitted to our hospital due to fever of 38. °C lasting for 6 h. Physical examination at admission time showed dysmorphic features of hypertelorism, palpebral edema, broad nose bridge, upturned nose, dysmorphic auricle, long philtrum, and a thin upper lip. Additionally, we found left wrist drop and bilateral strephexopodia, bilateral knee joint flexion contracture in this patient. A series of indicators were detected and showed abnormalities. Albumin was used to remit the hypoproteinemia and edema. However, the parents refused to accept further therapy and the boy died at age 3 months due to cachexy. To confirm the pathogenesis, genetic analysis were performed and revealed two mutations of NPHS1 gene: Exon18: c.2386G > C; p. (Gly796Arg) inherited from mother, and intron24: c.3286 + 5G > A; p.? inherited from father. And he also had a 22q11.2 duplication which was inherited from his mild affected mother. The pathogenesis of the intronic mutation has been further identified that it can defect alternative splicing of NPHS1.We present a patient who was caught in congenital nephrotic syndrome and 22q11.2 duplication syndrome simultaneously, emphasizing the importance of new sequencing technology on diagnosis of different genetic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536996>Atherogenesis in the Carotid Artery with and without Interrupted Blood Flow of Two Hyperlipidemic Mouse Strains.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries is a common cause of ischemic stroke. We examined atherogenesis in the left carotid artery with and without interrupted blood flow of C57BL/6 (B6) and C3H-Apoe-deficient (Apoe-/-) mouse strains.Blood flow was interrupted by ligating the common carotid artery near its bifurcation in one group of mice and another group was not interrupted.Without interference with blood flow, C3H-Apoe-/- mice developed no atherosclerosis in the carotid artery, while B6-Apoe-/- mice formed advanced atherosclerotic lesions (98,019 ± 10,594 μm2/section) after 12 weeks of a Western diet. When blood flow was interrupted by ligating the common carotid artery near its bifurcation, C3H-Apoe-/- mice showed fatty streak lesions 2 weeks after ligation, and by 4 weeks fibrous lesions had formed, although they were smaller than in B6-Apoe-/- mice. Neutrophil adhesion to endothelium and infiltration in lesions was observed in ligated arteries of both strains. Treatment of B6-Apoe-/- mice with antibody against neutrophils had little effect on lesion size.These findings demonstrate the dramatic influences of genetic backgrounds and blood flow on atherogenesis in the carotid artery of hyperlipidemic mice.© 2019 S.

There are limited data of oral antifungal efficacy in treating NDM onychomycosis.  A retrospective chart review (2009-2016) was conducted in patients receiving continuous oral terbinafine or pulse itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis due to NDMs. Mycology results and percent nail affected were recorded with patient characteristics including demographics and concurrent diseases. Complete, clinical, and mycological cure were tabulated.  Data from 176 patients were collected. Mycological and complete cure rates for terbinafine (69.8% and 17%) and itraconazole (67.% and 22%) were not significantly different from each other. Regardless of oral treatment, age ( = .013), baseline severity ( = .016), and presence of atherosclerosis ( = .040) or  ( = .033) decreased the likelihood of mycological cure, while age decreased the likelihood of complete cure ( = .001).  Continuous terbinafine and pulse itraconazole were similar in efficacy for curing NDM onychomycosis. Age was the most consistent prognostic factor affecting likelihood of cure, with factors that may influence drug reaching the site of infection also decreasing likelihood of mycological cure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614218>Mechanical Thrombectomy in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients Greater than 90 years of age experience in 26 patients in a Large Tertiary Care Center: Outcome comparison with younger patients.</a></h1><p>and Importance: Several independent randomized control trials have shown the superior efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, the elderly have been underrepresented or excluded in these trials. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and safety of mechanical thrombectomy in patients with AIS aged 90 years or greater.A retrospective review of patients age 90 years or older presenting with AIS who underwent mechanical thrombectomy between 2010 and 2018.Of total 453 patients with AIS, .74 % (26) were aged 90 or older, and 69.32 % (314) ranged from 60-89 years of age. Of all baseline characteristics between both groups, there is a significant difference in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking,  (HLD), atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus. The mean NIHSS upon admission was higher in the nonagenarians (17 vs. 15). Similar proportions of both groups received tPA (57.69%, 15 vs. 42.68%, 134, p=0.14). There was no difference in peri & post-procedural complications, good TICI score (88.46%, 23 vs. 87.58%, 275, p=1.00), "good" mRS scores (34.62%, 4 vs. 49.36%, 155, p=0.40), and mortality (11.54%, 3 vs. 13.06%, 41, p= 0.82).Age is one of the factors that affect functional outcome following mechanical thrombectomy. Advancements in catheter techniques, technical experience, and great outcomes with mechanical thrombectomy allow for pushing the envelope to deal with age as one of the factors, rather, than an exclusion criterion. Our results show that mechanical thrombectomy is safe and feasible in nonagenarians.Copyright © 2019.

EGCG has shown preventive role in hypercholesterolemia. However, due to low oral bioavailability, a need arises to improve its membrane permeability and transporter-mediated intestinal efflux. Therefore, an attempt was made to enhance permeability and bioavailability of EGCG using curcumin to treat . Further, it was formulated in herbal tea bags to achieve patient compliance.EGCG extracted from green tea leaves was confirmed by High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography. Green tea extract (GTE), curcumin and their mixtures were subjected to Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetry for compatibility studies. Powder formulation was prepared comprising GTE, curcumin, sucralose and cardamom.Ex-vivo study was performed on everted goat intestine, analyzed by HPLC and demonstrated highest permeation of GTE:curcumin (220:50) (53.15%) than GTE (20.57%). Antihyperlipidemic activity was performed in rats for 15 days. Blood sample analysis of rats of test groups (formulation and GTE solution) fed on high fat diet showed (mg/dl):cholesterol 80 and 90, triglycerides 73.25 and 85., HDL 50.75 and 46, LDL 43.9 and 46, VLDL 14.65 and 17.1 respectively with significant lipid regulating effect.Curcumin enhanced permeability of EGCG. Therefore, P-glycoprotein pump inside intestine can be potential mechanism to enhance permeability of EGCG.

We explored the prevalence, clinical characteristics, risk factors, imaging characteristics, and treatment strategy of IAAD to facilitate its diagnosis and treatment.We performed a meta-analysis of 17 studies, with single-arm-based and network meta-analysis as the main data synthesis method. The Medline, Embase, and Cochrane library were searched from their inception to July 2018. A total of 9163 patients with aortic disease were enrolled, with IAAD identified in 491 patients.The pooled prevalence of IAAD among cases of aortic dissection overall, type B aortic dissection, and type A aortic dissection was 1.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9%-3.4%), 4.1% (95% CI, 2.%-6.6%), and 2.0% (95% CI, 0.7%-3.9%), respectively. Abdominal pain was the most common symptom (50.8%), followed by back pain (30.%), and chest pain (21.7%). Up to 41.0% of the patients with IAAD did not present with any clinical symptoms, and up to 71.0% of these patients had negative findings on physical examination. The top 3 most prevalent risk factors for IAAD were hypertension, , and smoking. Most cases of IAAD were limited to the aorta inferior to the renal arteries (81.7%), and the average aortic diameter was 4 cm. No statistically significant difference was observed between open surgery, endovascular aortic repair, and conservative management for both early and late mortality.The results from the present meta-analysis regarding IAAD support the following conclusions and recommendations. First, IAAD is rare and predominantly affects males. Second, symptoms (pain) might or might not be present, and physical findings will rarely be found on abdominal examination. Third, hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor. Fourth, most cases IAAD will be infrarenal. Finally, a complication-specific approach, similar to that for type B aortic dissection, would be appropriate.Copyright © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A total of 1 402 975 adults aged 40 to 79 years who had no known cardiorenal disease were included.Systolic BP treated with antihypertensive medication.The yearly rates of critical cardiorenal events and all-cause death were estimated according to the levels of treated systolic BP and the presence of  risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, , proteinuria, and smoking).During the study periods, 225 103 of 487 412 participants (54.0% male; median [interquartile range] age, 50 [44-59] years) in the primary cohort and 360 503 of 915 563 participants (50.1% male; median [interquartile range] age, 52 [46-60] years) in the secondary cohort received antihypertensive treatment. In total, 28 411 of 51 292 cardiorenal incidents and 33 102 of 72 500 deaths were noted in ever-treated participants. The absolute increase in cardiorenal and mortality risk associated with inadequately treated BP was greater in participants with multiple risk factors than in those with 1 or 0 risk factors. The hazard ratios for critical cardiorenal events increased as the treated systolic BP increased to more than 130 to 140 mm Hg. The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for patients with 3 or more risk factors and treated systolic BP within the range of 110 to 119 mm Hg was 1.21 (95% CI, 1.07-1.37); 130 to 139 mm Hg, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.98-1.11); 140 to 149 mm Hg, 1.12 (95% CI, 1.05-1.20); 150 to 159 mm Hg, 1.21 (95% CI, 1.11-1.32); and 160 mm Hg or greater, 1.46 (95% CI, 1.32-1.62) compared with high-risk patients with BP of 120 to 129 mm Hg. For participants with 1 or 0 risk factors and treated systolic BP within the range of 110 to 119 mm Hg, the hazard ratio was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.07-1.22); 130 to 139 mm Hg, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.93-1.02); 140 to 149 mm Hg, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.91-1.09); 150 to 159 mm Hg, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.99-1.14); and 160 mm Hg or greater, 1.26 (95% CI, 1.15-1.37). However, when categorized using cardiovascular risk calculators, there was no consistent trend in mortality thresholds of BP across the risk score categories.These results suggest that intensive BP control is appropriate for reducing all-cause mortality in addition to cardiorenal risk in higher- rather than lower-risk patients.

Statins effectively combat hypercholesterolemia but are not well tolerated at high doses, raising the need for coprescription with cholesterol sorbents and/or absorption inhibitors. Montmorillonite (MMT) clay was found to attenuate hypercholesterolemia and obesity by reducing cholesterol and fat absorption. However, acicular clay-like sepiolite may offer better results due to its more substantial adsorption of nonpolar molecules. We herein aimed at (1) assessing  the capacity of sepiolite to adsorb edible oil and cholesterol compared with that of MMT and (2) assessing  the effect of continuous feeding on a high-fat high-cholesterol diet (HFD) (53.6% w/w fat and 0.2% cholesterol) supplemented with % (w/w) edible sepiolite, on diet-induced obesity rate, hypercholesterolemia, and . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed  that sepiolite adsorption of olive oil and cholesterol was five to eight times greater than that of MMT clay. Sepiolite supplementation to HFD fed to mature mice for 12. weeks resulted in lower total blood cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels and attenuated body weight gain, by reducing fat gain. Sepiolite supplementation did not affect energy intake but increased fecal extraction of sterols and lipids, without notable side effects. These results demonstrate that supplementing a HFD with sepiolite attenuates gastrointestinal absorption of dietary lipids and sterols, thus mitigating obesity, , and hypercholesterolemia.

Venous thrombosis, often at unusual sites, including splanchnic vein thrombosis and arterial thrombosis, as well as a hemorrhagic tendency and a propensity to transform into myelofibrosis or acute leukemia are common complications in patients with MPNs. The pathogenesis of thrombosis in MPN patients is complex and multifactorial. Disease related factors, such as an increase in blood cell counts (i.e., leukocytosis, erythrocytosis, and thrombocytosis), and more importantly presence of  mutation can interact with non-disease patient related factors such as age, previous history of thrombotic events, obesity, hypertension, , and presence of thrombophilic defects. The overall rate of recurrent thrombosis after venous thromboembolism (VTE) is 6.0 to 6. per 100 patient-years in patients with MPN compared to 2.7 to 3.7 per 100 patient-years in patients without MPN, and antithrombotic therapy with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is associated with a clear benefit, reducing the incidence of recurrence by 48 to 69%. Life-long oral anticoagulation with VKAs is the cornerstone of the antithrombotic treatment for splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT). Patients with MPN-related cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) should also be treated with long-term anticoagulation with VKAs. The role of direct acting oral anticoagulants in patients with thrombosis and MPN is not established and the use of these anticoagulants should be considered on an individual basis according to the risk of recurrent of VTE and bleeding.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382884>Prescribing patterns of coronary artery aneurysm in Taiwan.</a></h1><p>Coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) is a rare disease, and there are limited data on prescribing patterns for CAA. The aim of our study was to investigate prescribing patterns for CAA in Taiwan via the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).We included all CAA patients in Taiwan from 2005 to 2011. Data from 1 year before and after the CAA diagnosis were used to analyze examinations, comorbidities and prescribing patterns.A total of 1397 patients diagnosed with CAA were enrolled in our study. Most pediatric patients with CAA were diagnosed with Kawasaki disease (95.7%). In pediatric CAA patients, the utilization rates of aspirin and gamma globulins were 82.9 and 53.6%, respectively, after CAA diagnosis. Among the antithrombotic agents, aspirin was used most commonly, followed by dipyridamole (16.9%), heparin (.8%) and warfarin (4.6%). In adult CAA patients, common comorbidities included hypertension (63.4%),  (39.6%), and diabetes mellitus (26.1%). Coronary atherosclerosis was identified in 72.% of adult patients after CAA diagnosis. Antithrombotic agents, particularly aspirin, clopidogrel and heparin, were prescribed more frequently after CAA diagnosis. Among the prescribed medications, aspirin (75.8%), β-blockers (48.3%), statins (47.6%), metformin (14.4%), sulfonylureas (14.4%) and isosorbide mononitrate (32.9%) were frequently observed in each category.Kawasaki disease was the main cause of CAA in pediatric patients, and coronary artery disease was the most common comorbidity in adult CAA patients. The most commonly used antithrombic agent after CAA diagnosis was aspirin in both adult and pediatric patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390500>Volanesorsen and Triglyceride Levels in Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by loss of lipoprotein lipase activity and characterized by chylomicronemia and recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. There are no effective therapies. In an open-label study of three patients with this syndrome, antisense-mediated inhibition of hepatic  mRNA with volanesorsen led to decreased plasma apolipoprotein C-III and triglyceride levels.We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized 52-week trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of volanesorsen in 66 patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive volanesorsen or placebo. The primary end point was the percentage change in fasting triglyceride levels from baseline to 3 months.Patients receiving volanesorsen had a decrease in mean plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 25.7 mg per deciliter, corresponding to an 84% decrease at 3 months, whereas patients receiving placebo had an increase in mean plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 1.9 mg per deciliter, corresponding to a 6.1% increase (P<0.001). Patients receiving volanesorsen had a 77% decrease in mean triglyceride levels, corresponding to a mean decrease of 1712 mg per deciliter (19.3 mmol per liter) (95% confidence interval [CI], 1330 to 2094 mg per deciliter [15.0 to 23.6 mmol per liter]), whereas patients receiving placebo had an 18% increase in mean triglyceride levels, corresponding to an increase of 92.0 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per liter) (95% CI, -301.0 to 486 mg per deciliter [-3.4 to . mmol per liter]) (P<0.001). At 3 months, 77% of the patients in the volanesorsen group, as compared with 10% of patients in the placebo group, had triglyceride levels of less than 750 mg per deciliter (8. mmol per liter). A total of 20 of 33 patients who received volanesorsen had injection-site reactions, whereas none of the patients who received placebo had such reactions. No patients in the placebo group had platelet counts below 100,000 per microliter, whereas 15 of 33 patients in the volanesorsen group had such levels, including 2 who had levels below 25,000 per microliter. No patient had platelet counts below 50,000 per microliter after enhanced platelet-monitoring began.Volanesorsen lowered triglyceride levels to less than 750 mg per deciliter in 77% of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome. Thrombocytopenia and injection-site reactions were common adverse events.

The current study aimed to investigate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase  (MKP-) in islet cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Using gene overexpression and knockdown approaches, we demonstrated that MKP- could alleviate glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways owing to the altered regulation of caspase family members and ER stress-related molecules in MIN6 and primary islet cells. Overexpression of MKP- reversed the glucose and palmitic acid (GP)-induced impairment of insulin secretion as well as the abnormal decreases in the expression of islet functional genes, thereby maintaining the normal insulin secretory functionality, whereas the absence of MKP- aggravated islet cell dysfunction. In parallel, the production of ROS and increased inflammation-associated genes in response to GP were also reduced upon MKP- overexpression. Further, inhibition of JNK or P38 MAPK pathways resisted to glucolipotoxicity observed in MKP- knockdown MIN6 cells. These findings indicate that MKP- is an important mediator for glucolipotoxicity-induced islet cell dysfunction and apoptosis, with JNK and P38 as the critical downstream pathways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We used 48 female Wistar rats with an initial body weight of 123±1 g, which were divided into 6 groups. Group 1 (control) received a balanced semi-synthetic diet according to AIN93; group 2 - diet with excess fat (30% by weight); group 3 - a diet with the addition of 20% fructose solution instead of drinking water, group 4 - a diet with excess fat and fructose, group  - a diet with added cholesterol (0.%), group 6 - a diet with cholesterol and fructose. On the 64th day of the experiment, the mass of internal organs was determined; the levels of cytokines and adipokines in blood plasma were measured by multiplex immunoassay. . A decrease in the level of leptin was found in group  compared with the control and with groups 2, 4 and 6 groups (p<0.05). The lowest level of ghrelin was found in group 2 (p<0.05) against the background of high concentrations of leptin. Significant correlations were found between L/Gh and the total mass of animals (r=0.321; р=0.034), the relative mass of adipose tissue (r=0.439; р=0.003) and with the relative mass of the spleen (r=-0.460; р=0.003). In group 2, at the maximum L/Gh ratio, a significantly higher weight of adipose tissue was found, whereas in groups 3 and , at the lowest L/Gh ratio, the relative amount of total fat was the lowest. L/Gh ratio correlated with the level of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), RANTES, IL-18 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The concentrations of IL-17, IL-18, IL-4, IL-, MIP-3a, IFN-γ, M-CSF and RANTES in the experimental groups were reduced compared with the control, with the most pronounced effect in group  together with the lowest L/Gh ratio. . The presence of a significant correlation between L/Gh ratio and changes in the weight of rats' body, spleen, adipose tissue, as well as levels of cytokines involved in inflammation regulation, confirms the importance of L/Gh ratio as a biomarker in an in vivo model of dyslipidemia.Copyright© GEOTAR-Media Publishing Group.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401268>Preparation of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide‑chromium (III) complex and its hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activities in high-fat and high-fructose diet-induced pre-diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Polysaccharide from Ganoderma lucidum is one of the best metal-ion chelating agents because of its structural characteristics and excellent functional activities. In this study, we synthesized and characterized a novel G. lucidum polysaccharide‑chromium (III) [GLP-Cr(III)] complex. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the reaction conditions for the maximum chelation rate of GLP-Cr(III) complex. The optimal reaction conditions obtained from RSM were as follows: concentration of CrCl .71 mg/mL, pH 6.36, temperature 66.4 °C and time 2.0 h, respectively. The pH was the most significant factor, followed by reaction temperature and CrCl concentration. Under the optimal conditions, the experimental chelation rate was 94.17 ± 1.0% for GLP-Cr(III) complex, which agreed closely with the predicted value (94.60%). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy revealed that the primary sites of chromium (III)-binding in G. lucidum polysaccharide were OH and CO groups, which induce the morphology change from flat sheet to rough surface. Meanwhile, according to the result of X-ray diffraction (XRD), the crystal degree of GLP was disappeared after chelation with Cr(III). The presence of a "blind zone" in the H NMR spectrum obviously indicated the binding of Cr(III) to GLP. Additionally, the effects of GLP-Cr(III) complex on hyperglycemia and  in high fructose and fat diet-induced pre-diabetic mice were also investigated. Results showed that the serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting blood glucose levels and glucose tolerance in mice supplemented with GLP-Cr(III) complex (50 mg/kg day) were significantly lower than the model group (P < 0.01). More importantly, the GLP-Cr(III) complex had no significant adverse effects on the physiological metabolism, organ index, and liver tissue morphology of mice fed a normal diet. These results suggest that GLP-Cr(III) complex could be used as potential functional food ingredients for the prevention or treatment of hyperglycemia and .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the risk factors of an adverse cardiovascular event after a normal exercise (ESE) or dobutamine (DSE) stress echocardiography are not well established.  A cohort of 705 patients without previous history of CAD and a negative ESE/DSE was studied. All studies were performed in a high-volume echocardiologic laboratory and interpreted by two experienced echocardiography-trained cardiologists. Patients with inconclusive studies and those with an evidence of myocardial ischemia were excluded. Demographic, echocardiographic and hemodynamic findings were recorded. Patients were followed for at least 2 years. Independent predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were determined by regression analysis.  During a period of 55.7±17. months, MACE occurred in 35 (.0%) of patients. Negative predictive value (NPV) of DSE was 89.2%, which was significantly less than 96.% for ESE in predicting the occurrence of MACE ( = 0.001). MACE occurred more frequently among older (≥65 years) men with preexisting diabetes, hypertension, and/or . During ESE, a higher maximum blood pressure*heart rate product for the achieved level of metabolic equivalent (METS) of tasks was also an independent predictor of MACE.  Inability of patients to undergo traditional ESE that led to the choice of using DSE alternative reduces the NPV of the stress echocardiography among patients without previous history of CAD. A modest rise of heart rate and blood pressure in response to increased level of activity serves as favorable prognostic value and improves the NPV of stress echocardiography.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31144662>Protective effects of alendronate in Triton X-100-induced  in rats.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective effects of alendronate (used in osteoporosis disease) in Triton X-100 (a polyethylene glycol-based non-ionic surfactant)-induced  in rats.The animals were randomized into seven groups receiving different treatments for 21 days, and alendronate was administered (1. and 3 mg/kg body weight, per orally (p.o.) by oral gavage). On day 21, the rats were anesthetized and decapitated, blood samples were extracted, and the livers were dissected for various biochemical tests and histopathological examinations.The biochemical parameters, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and atherogenic index, were increased, and reduction in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels was observed following Triton X-100 treatment to rats. Alendronate (1. and 3 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent reduction in serum TC, VLDL-C, TGs, ratio of TC/HDL-C, ALT, AST, and TBARS. It significantly increased the HDL-C and superoxide dismutase levels but did not cause a significant decrease in serum LDL-C and/or an increase in catalase levels. Histopathological examinations of alendronate showed beneficial effects with lower capsular thickening, slight enlargement of the hepatocytes at the margin, and lower inflammatory cell infiltration.Alendronate showed dose-dependent antihyperlipidemic and hepatoprotective effects.

The use of the ratio of total cholesterol-to-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C) is often overlooked. The aim was to study TC/HDL-C in relation to later AMI, in a large sample of women, adjusted for age, educational status, smoking, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure, and neighbourhood socioeconomic status. The hypothesis was that increasing TC/HDL-C is associated with an increased risk of later AMI.From December 1995 to February 2000, 6147 women aged 50-59 years from the Womens' Health in Lund area (WHILA) study in southern Sweden underwent a physical examination, laboratory tests and filled in a questionnaire. The women were followed through national registers for incidence of AMI during a mean follow up of 17 years.An increasing TC/HDL-C showed a strong relationship with AMI, with the lowest hazard ratio (HR = 1) in women with a ratio of ≤3.. The HR for AMI was 1.14 (95% CI: 0.73-1.78) for those with a ratio between 3. and 4.0; in those with a ratio between 4.0 and .0 the HR for AMI was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.00-2.13) and in those with a ratio > .0 the HR was 1.89 (95% CI 1.26-2.82), after adjusting for potential confounding factors.TC/HDL-C ratio is a powerful predictor of AMI in middle-aged women.

Nonmydriatic fundus photographs were acquired to assess the severity of DR as per the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale (2002). Factors that potentially influence DR outcomes, including its incidence, progression, and regression, were identified via statistical analyses.We initially recruited 2453 subjects, among whom 2331 were followed and included in the final analysis. The incidences of new and progressed (ie, ≥2 scale steps) DR were 10.6% and 6.1%, respectively. Moreover, 7.3% of patients with established DR at baseline experienced complete regression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that high glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50, P = .021) and  (OR = 1.46, P = .025) were independent predictors of DR development, high HbA1c (OR = 4.16, P = .027) and macroalbuminuria (OR = .60, P = .010) predicted DR progression, and low HbA1c (OR = 0.20, P = .001) and low triglyceride levels (OR = 0.34, P = .026) were associated with DR regression.Albumin and HbA1c levels should be closely monitored as signs of progressive retinal damage in diabetic subjects.

We studied the effect of insurance type on patient outcomes after minimally invasive pulmonary lobectomy for lung cancer.We retrospectively analyzed 433 consecutive patients who underwent robotic-assisted pulmonary lobectomy by one surgeon during an 80-month period. Perioperative outcomes and intraoperative and postoperative complications were noted. Disposition at discharge after surgery (favorable, eg, transfer to home with self-care or with home health nursing and/or physical therapy, versus unfavorable, eg, long-term acute care or rehabilitation facility, hospice, or death) and -year overall survival (-years OS) were also recorded. We used Pearson χ, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Kruskal-Wallis test to compare variables and Cox regression for survival analysis.There were 107 patients (mean age 57. years) with private insurance, 118 (mean age 70.3 years) with public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), 196 (mean age 71.8 year; P < .001) with combination insurance plans (Medicare plus a privately supplied supplemental), and 12 patients with no insurance (excluded owing to low sample size). There were more current smokers in the public insurance group, more former smokers in the combination insurance group, and more nonsmokers in the private insurance group (P = .03). There were more comorbidities in the public and combination insurance groups versus the private insurance group, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (P = .003), hypertension (P = .01), and  (P < .001). The groups had no differences in tumor size or pathologic stage. There were higher numbers of intraoperative conversions to open lobectomy in the private and public insurance groups versus the combination insurance group (P = .001). Also, the private and combination insurance groups had more cases of favorable disposition at discharge after surgery compared with the public insurance group (P < .001). Multivariable regression analyses identified private insurance type as an independent predictor of favorable disposition at discharge (public versus private plan; odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.85, P = .02) and -year OS (combination versus private plan; hazard ratio, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.26-.67, P = .01; public versus private plan; HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.37-.89; P = .01).Although public or combination insurance type was associated with greater risk of all-cause mortality, and public insurance type was associated with less favorable disposition at discharge after surgery and overall conversion to open lobectomy, insurance type was not associated with increased intraoperative complications, hospital duration of stay, or in-hospital mortality after minimally invasive robotic-assisted pulmonary lobectomy.Copyright © 2019.

This study investigated location-specific changes of extracellular nucleotide metabolism in aortic valves of patients with calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Individual ecto-enzymes and adenosine receptors involved were analyzed together with correlation with CAVD severity and risk factors.Nucleotide and adenosine degradation rates were adversely modified on the aortic surface of stenotic valve as compared to ventricular side, including decreased ATP removal (1.25 ± 0.35 vs. 2.24 ± 0.61 nmol/min/cm) and adenosine production (1.32 ± 0.12 vs. 2.49 ± 0.28 nmol/min/cm) as well as increased adenosine deamination (1.28 ± 0.31 vs. 0.67 ± 0.11 nmol/min/cm). The rates of nucleotide to adenosine conversions were lower, while adenosine deamination was higher on the aortic sides of stenotic vs. non-stenotic valve. There were no differences in extracellular nucleotide metabolism between aortic and ventricular sides of non-stenotic valves. Furthermore, nucleotide degradation rates, measured on aortic side in CAVD (n = 62), negatively correlated with echocardiographic and biochemical parameters of disease severity (aortic jet velocity vs. ATP hydrolysis: r = - 0.30, p < 0.05; vs. AMP hydrolysis: r = - 0.44, p < 0.001; valvular phosphate concentration vs. ATP hydrolysis: r = - 0.26, p < 0.05; vs. AMP hydrolysis: r = - 0.25, p = 0.05) while adenosine deamination showed positive correlation trend with valvular phosphate deposits (r = 0.23, p = 0.07). Nucleotide and adenosine conversion rates also correlated with CAVD risk factors, including  (AMP hydrolysis vs. serum LDL cholesterol: r = - 0.28, p = 0.05; adenosine deamination vs. total cholesterol: r = 0.25, p = 0.05; LDL cholesterol: r = 0.28, p < 0.05; triglycerides: r = 0.32, p < 0.05), hypertension (adenosine deamination vs. systolic blood pressure: r = 0.28, p < 0.05) and thrombosis (ATP hydrolysis vs. prothrombin time: r = - 0.35, p < 0.01). Functional assays as well as histological and immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and RT-PCR studies identified all major ecto-enzymes engaged in nucleotide metabolism in aortic valves that included ecto-nucleotidases, alkaline phosphatase, and ecto-adenosine deaminase. We have shown that changes in nucleotide-converting ecto-enzymes were derived from their altered activities on valve cells and immune cell infiltrate. We have also demonstrated a presence of A1, A2a and A2b adenosine receptors with diminished expression of A2a and A2b in stenotic vs. non-stenotic valves. Finally, we revealed that augmenting adenosine effects by blocking adenosine deamination with deoxycoformycin decreased aortic valve thickness and reduced markers of calcification via adenosine-dependent pathways in a mouse model of CAVD.This work highlights profound changes in extracellular nucleotide and adenosine metabolism in CAVD. Altered extracellular nucleotide hydrolysis and degradation of adenosine in stenotic valves may affect purinergic responses to support a pro-stenotic milieu and valve calcification. This emphasizes a potential mechanism and target for prevention and therapy. .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620021>Multiple Hits in Acute Pancreatitis: Components of Metabolic Syndrome Synergize Each Other's Deteriorating Effects.</a></h1><p>The incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP) and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) are growing worldwide. Several studies have confirmed that obesity (OB),  (HL), or diabetes mellitus (DM) can increase severity, mortality, and complications in AP. However, there is no comprehensive information on the independent or joint effect of MetS components on the outcome of AP. Our aims were (1) to understand whether the components of MetS have an independent effect on the outcome of AP and (2) to examine the joint effect of their combinations.From 2012 to 2017, 1435 AP cases from 28 centers were included in the prospective AP Registry. Patient groups were formed retrospectively based on the presence of OB, HL, DM, and hypertension (HT). The primary endpoints were mortality, severity, complications of AP, and length of hospital stay. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.1257 patients (55.7 ± 17.0 years) were included in the analysis. The presence of OB was an independent predictive factor for renal failure [OR: 2.98 (CI: 1.33-6.66)] and obese patients spent a longer time in hospital compared to non-obese patients (12.1 vs. 10.4 days,  = 0.008). HT increased the risk of severe AP [OR: 3.41 (CI: 1.39-8.37)], renal failure [OR: 7.46 (CI: 1.61-34.49)], and the length of hospitalization (11.8 vs. 10. days,  = 0.020). HL increased the risk of local complications [OR: 1.51 (CI: 1.10-2.07)], renal failure [OR: 6.4 (CI: 1.93-21.17)], and the incidence of newly diagnosed DM [OR: 2.55 (CI: 1.26-.19)]. No relation was found between the presence of DM and the outcome of AP. 906 cases (mean age ± : 56.9 ± 16.7 years) had data on all four components of MetS available. The presence of two, three, or four MetS factors increased the incidence of an unfavorable outcome compared to patients with no MetS factors.OB, HT, and HL are independent risk factors for a number of complications.

We aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors for recurrent and de novo NAFLD/NASH post-LT.MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched for studies from 2000 to 2018. Risk of bias was adjudicated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Seventeen studies representing 2378 patients were included. All were retrospective analyses of patients with post-LT liver biopsies, with the exception of 2 studies that used imaging for outcome assessment. Seven studies evaluated occurrence of recurrent NAFLD/NASH, 3 evaluated de novo occurrence, and 7 evaluated both recurrent and de novo. In studies at generally high or moderate risk of bias, mean 1-, 3-, and ≥-year incidence rates may be 59%, 57%, and 82% for recurrent NAFLD; 67%, 40%, and 78% for de novo NAFLD; 53%, 57.4%, and 38% for recurrent NASH; and 13%, 16%, and 17% for de novo NASH. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that post-LT body mass index (summarized odds ratio = 1.27) and  were the most consistent predictors of outcomes.There is low confidence in the incidence of recurrent and de novo NAFLD and NASH after LT due to study heterogeneity. Recurrent and de novo NAFLD may occur in over half of recipients as soon as 1 year after LT. NASH recurs in most patients after LT, whereas de novo NASH occurs rarely. NAFLD/NASH after LT is associated with metabolic risk factors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595197>Role of Regulatory T cells in Atorvastatin Induced Absorption of Chronic Subdural Hematoma in Rats.</a></h1><p>Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a neurological disorder with a substantial recurrence rate. Atorvastatin is an effective drug for treating  and known to improve neurological outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage. Previous studies have reported that atorvastatin treatment promotes hematoma absorption in CSDH, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin mediate absorption of CSDH. 144 male, Wistar rats (6 months old) were randomly divided into the following groups: 1) sham surgery control, 2) treatment: CSDH + atorvastatin, and 3) vehicle control: CSDH + saline. Atorvastatin or saline was orally administered daily for 19 days after CSDH procedure. A T2WI MRI was used to evaluate CSDH volume changes during the time course of the study. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining were used to measure the number of regulatory T cells (Treg). ELISA was used to measure cytokine level in the hematoma border. Neurological function and cognitive outcome were evaluated using Foot-Fault test and Morris Water Maze test, respectively. When compared to saline treatment, atorvastatin treatment accelerated the absorption of CSDH as indicated by decreased hematoma volume in T2WI MRI data on 14 and 21 day after CSDH (P<0.05). Atorvastatin treatment significantly increased the number of Treg in circulation and hematoma border from 3 to 21 day after CSDH. Atorvastatin treatment significantly decreased the levels of interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), but increased IL-10 level in the hematoma border. Atorvastatin treatment also improved neurological function and cognitive outcome compared to vehicle treated group. Atorvastatin induced anti-inflammatory responses and increased Treg in circulation and brain which may contribute to the accelerated CSDH absorption in rats.Copyright: © 2019 Quan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493727>Screening mammography beyond breast cancer: breast arterial calcifications as a sex-specific biomarker of cardiovascular risk.</a></h1><p>To highlight the importance of quantitative breast arterial calcifications (BAC) assessment for an effective stratification of cardiovascular (CV) risk in women, for whom current preventive strategies are inadequate. BAC, easily detectable on mammograms, are associated with CV disease and represent a potential imaging biomarker for CV disease prevention in women.We summarized the available evidence on this topic.Age, parity, diabetes, and  were found to positively correlate with BAC. Women with BAC have a higher CV risk than those without BAC: the relative risk was reported to be 1.4 for transient ischemic attack/stroke, 1. for thrombosis, 1.8 for myocardial infarction; the reported hazard ratio was 1.32 for coronary artery disease (CAD), 1.52 for heart failure, 1.29 for CV death, 1.44 for death from CAD. However, BAC do not alarm radiologists; when reported, they are commonly mentioned as "present", not impacting on CV decision-making. Of 18 published studies, 9 reported only presence/absence of BAC, 4 used a semi-quantitative scale, and  a continuous scale (with manual, automatic or semiautomatic segmentation). Various appearance, topological complexity, and vessels overlap make BAC quantification difficult to standardize. Nevertheless, machine learning approaches showed promising results in BAC quantification on mammograms.There is a strong rationale for mammography to become a dual test for breast cancer screening and CV disease prevention. However, robust and automated quantification methods are needed for a deeper insight on the association between BAC and CV disease, to stratifying CV risk and define personalized preventive actions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The exposures were stroke, atrial fibrillation, coronary disease, , hypertension, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, valvular heart disease, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson disease. The secondary outcome was a new diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Marginal structural Cox models adjusting for time-dependent confounding were used to characterize the association between exposures and outcomes. We also evaluated the association between cerebrovascular risk factors and subsequent renal colic (negative control).Among 1,035,536 Medicare beneficiaries followed for a mean of .2 years, 15,531 (1.%) participants were diagnosed with Parkinson disease and 81,974 (7.9%) were diagnosed with Alzheimer disease. Most evaluated cerebrovascular risk factors, including prior stroke (hazard ratio = 1.55; 95% confidence interval = 1.39-1.72), were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of Parkinson disease. The magnitudes of these associations were similar, but attenuated, to the associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and Alzheimer disease. Confirming the validity of our analytical model, most cerebrovascular risk factors were not associated with the subsequent diagnosis of renal colic.Cerebrovascular risk factors are associated with Parkinson disease, an effect comparable to their association with Alzheimer disease.

However, the prognostic significance of troponin elevation following coronary intervention is still debated.Patient-level data from  contemporary coronary stent trials and 1 large registry were pooled. Mortality of patients with stable angina, with normal baseline biomarkers, was compared between patients with and those without different cutoff values of cTn and CK-MB.A total of 13,452 patients were included in this pooled analysis. The overall percentage of patients with elevated biomarkers following PCI was 23.9% for CK-MB and 68.4% for cTn. In the patient cohort for whom both assays were available (n = 8,859), 2.4% had both CK-MB ≥ × the upper limit of normal (ULN) and cTn ≥35 × ULN, while 92% had both CK-MB < × ULN and cTn <35 × ULN. Among patients with CK-MB ≥ × ULN (n = 315), 212 (67.3%) also had cTn ≥35 × ULN. Conversely, 390 of patients (64.8%) who had cTn ≥35 × ULN did not have CK-MB ≥ × ULN. A total of 259 patients (1.9%) died at 1 year; 20 (7.7%) had CK-MB ≥ × ULN, and 23 (8.8%) had cTn ≥35 × ULN. In the Cox multivariate analysis, in which the CK-MB and cTn ratios post-procedure were forced into the model, age, prior myocardial infarction, lesion complexity, , and CK-MB ratio (≥10) post-procedure were associated with increased 1-year mortality.Following elective PCI in patients in stable condition treated with second-generation drug-eluting stent, CK-MB and cTn elevations remain common. After multivariate adjustment, there was an increased mortality rate with elevation of CK-MB after PCI, whereas cTn elevation was not independently associated with mortality at 1 year.Copyright © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

However, little is known regarding the potential effects of chronic physical illness (CPI) on schizophrenia treatment outcomes. In the present report, we aim to provide an updated review of the relevant literature.We searched MEDLINE for studies published between 2017 and 2018. After screening 683 articles, we included six studies of adequate quality. Five of these studies reported significant associations between several CPIs and different schizophrenia treatment outcomes, whereas the remaining study did not. Significant effects were low to moderate in size. CPIs with significant effects on treatment outcomes included metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. No significant effects were observed for diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis, hypertension, , or lung conditions. One study reported a significant association between the total number of CPIs and the overall number of psychiatric rehospitalizations.In addition to increasing the risk of premature mortality, accumulating evidence indicates that various CPIs affect schizophrenia treatment outcomes. Thus, researchers and healthcare practitioners should increase efforts to raise awareness regarding the importance of physical health among patients with schizophrenia. Further high-quality studies are required, particularly those targeting the potential effects of individual CPIs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340308>Prevalence of depression and anxiety and their association with cardiovascular risk factors in Northeast Brasil primary care patients.</a></h1><p>Depression and anxiety disorders (DAD) are the most prevalent mental health conditions worldwide.

The secondary end-point was short-term outcomes such as in-hospital mortality and paraplegia determined by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. The patients in the HAR group were older (60.20 ± 9.95 v 46.43 ± 10.79, p < 0.0001) and exhibited a greater rate of diabetes (11.3% v 2.0%, p = 0.0004),  (47.2% v 25.4%, p < 0.0001), and coronary artery disease (13.2% v 4.3%, p < 0.0001) than those in the CTAR group. Following propensity score matching of 95 matched pairs, the difference in preoperative risk diminished. The HAR group led to a shorter cardiopulmonary bypass time (133.33 ± 41.47 v 179.62 ± 40.79, p < 0.0001) and avoided circulatory arrest.

The complement system plays a leading role in vessel integrity and inflammation response. However, the association between serum complement level and the prognosis of HF remains unclear.In our study, a total of 263 newly diagnosed hypertension patients with HF were included. Eight classical Cardiovascular(CV) risk factors were collected, and plasma C3a, C3b, C5a, sC5b-9, and CH50 levels were detected.Compared with control group, plasma C5a(p<0.001), sC5b-9 (p<0.001) and CH50 (p=0.004) levels of hypertension patients with HF were significantly increased. Based on univariate analysis, an older age, higher frequency of alcohol consumption, high level of BMI, medium or high risk of hypertension, , and diabetes were poor prognostic factors while low levels of C5a, sC5b-9 and CH50 were associated with favorable overall survival (OS). When these factors fit into a multivariate regression model, patients with  (P=0.002, HR=3.09), NT-pro-BNP ≥ 14.8 (P<0.001, HR=11.14), sC5b-9 level ≥ 1406.2 ug/ml (P=0.180, HR=.51) or CH50 level ≥ 294.6 ug/ml (P<0.001, HR=4.57) remained statistically factors for worsened OS and regarded as independent risk factors. These independently associated risk factors were used to form an OS estimation nomogram. Nomogram demonstrated good accuracy in estimating the risk, with a bootstrap-corrected C index of 0.789.sC5b-9 and CH50 levels are increased in hypertension patients with HF.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of spliced vein bypass (SVB) as primary treatment versus treatment after failed endovascular intervention (endovascular SVB [ESVB]) for infrainguinal revascularization.A retrospective analysis of a single vascular group's database of all SVBs was queried for demographics, indications, intraoperative details, and outcomes. Exclusion criteria included acute ischemia, aneurysm, dual outflow, bypass revisions, and patients lost to immediate follow-up. SPSS software was used for statistical analysis.Two hundred thirty-five infrainguinal SVBs were performed between January 2011 and March 2017. There were 182 SVB (77%) and 53 ESVB (23%) with a mean follow-up of 488 days (range, 1-2140). Demographics between the SVB and ESVB groups were similar in all categories recorded: diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, current smoker, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, , and renal disease (P = .29). Indications for bypass were not statistically significant between SVB and ESVB (P = .48). The study included Rutherford class 3 (14 vs 2), class 4 (51 vs 20), class  (67 vs 18), and class 6 (50 vs 13). Inflow was grouped into iliac (2.6%), femoral (88%), and popliteal (9.8%). Outflow arteries were grouped into below knee popliteal (14.9%) and infrapopliteal (85.1%). Inflow and outflow arteries, as well as number of spliced pieces per bypass were not different between groups. Major amputation rates were not different between SVB and ESVB for the entire study period. There was no statistical difference with patency outcomes based on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (P = .84).An aggressive endovascular first strategy for treatment of patients without adequate autogenous conduit seems to offer benefit without negatively affecting future bypass options. SVB patency and major amputation rates in this series were not affected by a prior endovascular treatment.Copyright © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In heart, the accumulation of saturated fatty acids has been determined to play a role in the development of heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been reported to possess key atheroprotective biological properties, including cellular cholesterol efflux capacity, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to test whether HDL could protect palmitic acid (PA)-induced cardiomyocyte injury and explore the possible mechanisms.H9c2 cells were pretreated with HDL (50-100 μg/ml) for 2 h followed by PA (0. mM) for indicated time period. Our results showed that HDL inhibited PA-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, HDL rescued PA-induced ROS generation and the phosphorylation of JNK which in turn activated NF-κB-mediated inflammatory proteins expressions. We also found that PA impaired the balance of BCL family proteins, destabilized mitochondrial membrane potential, and triggered subsequent cytochrome c release into the cytosol and activation of caspase 3. These detrimental effects were ameliorated by HDL treatment.PA-induced ROS accumulation and results in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammation.

Participants underwent standardised systemic and ocular examinations. RNFL thickness was obtained using a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT). RNFL symmetry (in %) was calculated based on Pearson correlation coefficient between the RNFL thickness profiles of the right and left eyes. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to investigate the associations between ocular and systemic factors with RNFL symmetry.4211 participants (1227 Chinese, 1245 Malays, 1739 Indians) were included. The mean RNFL symmetry was 86.7%±8.% in Chinese, 84.7%±10.2% in Malays and 84.0%±10.7% in Indians. The fifth percentile limit of RNFL symmetry was 71.2% in Chinese, 65.0% in Malays and 62.0% in Indians. In multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, , intereye absolute differences in intraocular pressure (IOP), axial length and disc area, Malays (β=-0.9; p=0.03) and Indians (β=-1.76; p<0.001) were found to have lower RNFL symmetry compared with Chinese. Older age, greater intereye differences in IOP, axial length and disc area were significantly associated with lower RNFL symmetry (all p≤0.003).In non-glaucoma individuals, intereye RNFL profile is less symmetric in Malays and Indians than that in Chinese. This also suggests that current commercial optical coherence tomography's deployment of a single, universal RNFL symmetry cut-off for glaucoma detection is flawed, and ethnic-specific cut-off is warranted.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We sought to determine predictors of negative DWI in suspected stroke patients treated with IV-tPA.A retrospective case-control study encompassing all acute stroke patients treated with IV-tPA (at our hospital or "dripped and shipped") from January 2013 to December 2014 was con- ducted. A total of 275 patients were identified with 47 negative DWI cases and 228 positive DWI controls. Variables including demographic factors, stroke characteristics, and clinical comorbidities were analyzed for statistical significance. A multivariate logistic regression was performed (SPSS-24) to identify predictors of negative DWI.Approximately 17% of patients had negative DWI after IV-tPA. Compared to controls, migraine history independently predicted negative DWI (odds ratio [OR] .0 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-24.6, P = .046). Increasing age (OR .97 95% CI .94-.99, P = .02) and atrial fibrillation (OR .25 95% CI .08-.77, P = .01) predicted lower probability of negative DWI.

We conducted a  years prospective study. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning. Carotid computed tomography angiography (CTA) was conducted using a 64-multidetector row scanner to assess carotid arterial plaque at baseline and during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to evaluate the association of BMD and risk of carotid calcification plaques.  Four hundred and eighty-eight women sustained prospective carotid plaques during the follow-up. Women with carotid calcification plaques had low BMD than those with carotid non-calcification plaques. After adjustment for potential confounders, BMD, age, years since menopause, levels of plasma osteoprotegerin and adiponectin, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and  were independently associated with increased risk of carotid calcification plaques. For carotid calcification plaques, a significant inverse correlation was indicated between BMD and the plaques, and a significant positive correlation was indicated between bone loss and plaques.  This study suggested that lower BMD and increased loss rate of BMD were associated with a higher risk of carotid calcification plaques in Chinese postmenopausal women.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449955>Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty in Clinical Practice for Below-the-Knee, Popliteal, and Crural Artery Lesions Causing Critical Limb Ischemia: 1-Year Results from the Spanish Luminor Registry.</a></h1><p>Luminor is a new drug-coated angioplasty balloon, which is approved by the European Conformity market. The aim of the present study is to analyze the 1-year results, in terms of effectiveness and safety, of the Luminor® 14/14M and 35 drug-coated balloons (iVascular, Sant Vicenç dels Horts, Barcelona, Spain) in a special cohort of critical limb ischemia (CLI) of the Luminor registry.Luminor is phase IV, nonrandomized, prospective, observational, and multicenter clinical study. The present study includes patients with CLI to analyze the effectiveness, in terms of primary patency, and the safety defined by the major adverse effects: any cause mortality, major amputation, and/or clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR). Both femoropopliteal and below-the-knee infrapopliteal lesions were treated. All the end points were assessed after the procedure, at 30 days, 6 and 12 months thereafter.About 148 patients (101 males; mean age, 73.2 ± 11.4 years) with CLI were included. About 83.3% were classified as Rutherford's class . Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 71.6%; hypertension, , renal insufficiency, and coronary disease were present in 87.2%, 57.4%, 29.7%, and 39.2% of the sample, respectively. The average follow-up was 11.2 ± 3.27 months. The primary patency and the freedom of clinically driven TLR, at 1 year, were 87.7% and 92.1%, respectively. Survival and freedom from major amputations were 85.1% and 84.7%, respectively.Even with a very sick population, the results at 12 months are highly satisfactory with reference to survival, freedom from amputation, patency, and the absence of reintervention.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 1 136 patients with bifurcation lesions hospitalized in 6 selected hospitals between January 2010 and January 2014 were included in this prospective observational trial, patients were divided into either ATP (560) or PS group (576) accordingly. The primary endpoint was target lesion revascularization within 1 year, and the second endpoints were all-cause death, cardiogenic death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, recurrent angina within 1 year.  There were no significant differences in age, sex, hypertension, diabetes,  and smoking history between the two groups (0.05). The incidence of TIMI blood flow <3 grade in the side branch (1.6%(9/560) vs. 7.% (43/576), 0.01), acute occlusion of the side branch (1.3%(7/560) vs. 7.1%(41/576), 0.01) and implanted stents of side branch (1.8%(10/560) vs. 7.8% (45/576), 0.01) were significantly lower in the ATP group than those in the PS group. During the one year follow up, the rate of target lesion revascularization was similar between ATP group and PS group (4.6%(26/560) vs. 4.0%(23/576), 0.66).  The effectiveness and safetyof ATP techniquein the patients with coronary bifurcation lesions is comparable to the PS technique.

All the synthesized compounds were preliminarily screened by using the Triton WR-1339-induecd  model, in which T1 exhibited more potent hypolipidemic property than positive drug fenofibrate (FF). T1 also significantly decreased serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterin (LDL) in methionine solution (Mets) induced hyperlipidemic mice. Moreover, hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) were obviously ameliorated after treatment with T1 and the histological observation indicated that T1 ameliorated the injury in liver tissue and inhibited the hepatic lipid accumulation. In the livers of T1-administrated rat, the levels of PPARα related to lipids metabolism were up-regulated. Additional effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and HS releasing action confirmed and reinforced the activity of T1 as a potential multifunctional hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective agent.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients were randomly assigned (2:2:2:1) to treatment with the fixed-dose combination, bempedoic acid 180 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg or placebo added to stable background statin therapy for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change from baseline to week 12 in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.Among the 301 patients included in the primary analysis, the mean baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 3.87 mmol/L (149.8 mg/dL). At week 12, the fixed-dose combination lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-36.2%) significantly more than placebo (1.8% (placebo-corrected difference -38.0%);  < 0.001), ezetimibe alone (-23.2%;  < 0.001) or bempedoic acid alone (-17.2%;  < 0.001). The fixed-dose combination lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels similarly across subgroups, including patients receiving high-intensity, other-intensity or no statin therapy. Improvements with the fixed-dose combination were also observed in secondary efficacy endpoints, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. In this trial, fixed-dose combination treatment had a generally similar safety profile compared with bempedoic acid, ezetimibe or placebo.The bempedoic acid and ezetimibe fixed-dose combination significantly lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol versus placebo or other oral monotherapies and had a favourable safety profile when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high cardiovascular disease risk.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136581>Preexisting chronic conditions for fatal outcome among SFTS patients: An observational Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease that is caused by a novel bunyavirus SFTSV. Currently our knowledge of the host-related factors that influence the pathogenesis of disease is inadequate to allow prediction of fatal outcome. Here we conducted a prospective study of the largest database on the SFTS patients, to identify the presence of comorbidities in SFTS, and estimate their effect on the fatal outcome. Among 2096 patients eligible for inclusion, we identified nine kinds of comorbidities, from which  (12.2%; 95% CI: 10.8%-13.6%), hypertension (11.0%; 95% CI: 9.6%-12.3%), chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) (9.3%; 95% CI: 8.1%-10.%), and diabetes mellitus (DM) (6.8%; 95% CI: .7%-7.9%) were prevalent. Higher risk of death was found in patients with DM (adjusted OR = 2.304; 95% CI: 1.520-3.492; P<0.001), CVH (adjusted OR = 1.551; 95% CI: 1.053-2.285; P = 0.026) and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (adjusted OR = 2.170; 95% CI: 1.215-3.872; P = 0.009) after adjusting for age, sex, delay from disease onset to admission and treatment regimens. When analyzing the comorbidities separately, we found that the high serum glucose could augment diseases severity. Compared to the group with max glucose < 7.0 mmol/L, patients with glucose between 7.0-11.1 mmol/L and glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L conferred higher death risk, with the adjusted OR to be 1.467 (95% CI: 1.081-1.989; P = 0.014) and 3.443 (95% CI: 2.427-4.884; P<0.001). Insulin therapy could effectively reduce the risk of severe outcome in DM patients with the adjusted OR 0.146 (95% CI: 0.058-0.365; P<0.001). For CVH patients, severe damage of liver and prolongation of blood coagulation time, as well as high prevalence of bleeding phenotype were observed.

Owing to the mentioned facts, it is ever more imperative to screen and treat FH patients. Subsequent to the identification of patients, the project focuses on the improvement of their prognoses. The ScreenPro FH project was established as a functional international network for the diagnosis, screening, and treatment of FH. Individual countries were assigned goals, e.g., to define the actual situation and available treatment. With "central support," more centers and countries participated in the project. Subsequently, individual countries reported the results at the beginning and end of the project. Collected data were statistically evaluated.The increasing number of patients in databases, from 7500 in 2014 to 25,347 in 2018, demonstrates the improvement in overall effectiveness, as well as an increase in the number of centers from 70 to 252. Before all, LDL-C decreased by 41.% and total cholesterol by 32.3%. As data from all countries and patients were not available at the time of the analysis, only those results from 10 countries and 5585 patients at the beginning of the project and at the time of writing are included. Our data are quite positive. However, our results have only limited validity. Our patients are far from the target levels of LDL-C. The situation can be improved with the introduction of new therapy, PCSK9-i, evolocumab, and alirocumab.

Neointimal hyperplasia is a significant resulting morbidity. Increased fatty acid (FA) levels lead to dysfunctional endothelium, defined as activated, proinflammatory and prothrombotic. The purpose of this review is to assess the recent literature on the emerging concept that uptake of FA into many tissues is regulated at the endothelial level, and this in turn contributes to endothelial dysfunction, an initiating factor in insulin resistant states, atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia.Studies support the role of endothelial FA uptake proteins as an additional level of regulation in tissue FA uptake. These proteins include CD36, FA transport proteins, FA-binding proteins and caveolin-1. In many cases, inappropriate expression of these proteins can result in a change in FA and glucose uptake, storage and utilization. Accumulation of plasma FA is one mechanism by which alterations in expression of FA uptake proteins can lead to endothelial dysfunction; changes in tissue substrate metabolism leading to inflammation are also implicated.Identification of the critical players and regulators can lead to therapeutic targeting to reduce endothelial dysfunction and sequela such as insulin resistance and neointimal hyperplasia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464232>High Serum Endothelin-1 Level is Associated with Poor Response to Steroid Therapy in Childhood-Onset Nephrotic Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is one of the most common kidney diseases seen in children. It is a disorder characterized by severe proteinuria, hypoproteinemia, , and generalized edema resulting from alterations of permeability at the glomerular capillary wall. Endothelin-1 (ET1) has a central role in the pathogenesis of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis and has a role in assessment of the clinical course of NS in children. This study aims to investigate the relationship between ET1 serum level and the response to steroid therapy in children with primary NS. Serum ET1 levels were evaluated in 55 children with NS. They were classified into two groups: 30 patients with steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS) and 25 patients with steroid-resistant NS (SRNS). The SSNS group was further divided into infrequent-relapsing NS (IFRNS) and steroid-dependent NS (SDNS), while the SRNS group was subdivided into two groups according to renal pathology. ET1 levels were significantly higher in the SRNS group (52. ± 45.8 pg/dL) compared to the SSNS group (18.3 ± 17 pg/dL) (P <0.001). Furthermore, ET1 levels were significantly higher in SDNS (54.3 ± 18.6) compared to IFRNS (11.9 ± 7.8, P = 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in ET1 levels between minimal change disease group and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis group, (P = 0.28).

In this study, we aimed to calculate the likelihood of having ≥1 MetS component in normoweight young adults using two different metabolic health criteria. We recruited 1182 normoweight young adults from the Taiwan Survey on the Prevalence of Hypertension, Hyperglycemia, and  and the National Health Interview Survey (aged 16-45 years, 39% male, body mass index = 18.-22.99, all without MetS) and followed them for  years. Metabolic health criteria were derived from the Harmonized criteria (unhealthy if showing abnormality in one or two MetS components) and the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG-i; unhealthy if TyG-i was in the >75th percentile). Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimations for having ≥1 MetS component and for having each MetS component in  years were assessed using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. We observed a significantly increased likelihood of the presence of ≥1 MetS component in the unhealthy group by using the Harmonized criteria and TyG-i (adjusted OR (aOR); 95%CI: 2.67; 2.04-3.49 and 2.1; 1.57-2.82, respectively). The areas under the receiver-operating characteristics curves were 0.679 and 0.652 for the final models using Harmonized and TyG-i criteria, respectively. These findings support the recommendation of treating any metabolic component abnormality, even in young adults without a MetS diagnosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622142>Increasing Influenza and Pneumococcal Vaccination Uptake in Seniors Using Point-of-Care Informational Interventions in Primary Care in Singapore: A Pragmatic, Cluster-Randomized Crossover Trial.</a></h1><p> To evaluate the effectiveness of point-of-care informational interventions in general practitioner clinics to improve influenza and pneumococcal vaccination uptake among elderly patients. We conducted a pragmatic, cluster-randomized crossover trial in 22 private general practitioner clinics in Singapore, from November 2017 to July 2018. We included all patients aged 65 years or older. Clinics were assigned to a 3-month intervention (flyers and posters encouraging vaccination) plus 1-month washout period, and a 4-month control period (usual care). Primary outcomes were differences in vaccination uptake rates between periods. Secondary outcomes were identification of other factors associated with vaccination uptake.

Hamsters were fed an HC diet for four weeks to induce  and were then fed an HC diet enriched with % (low-dose HC + HO group;  = 10) and 10% HO (high-dose HC + HO group;  = 10) for 12 weeks. Serum lipid levels, hepatic changes (including steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis), and hepatic prooxidant-antioxidant status (malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST)) were evaluated after the treatment period. : Hamsters in the control group showed normal serum lipid profiles, normal liver function, and moderate glycogen storage without hepatic steatosis. Hamsters in the HC group showed severe , severe hepatic steatosis, and moderate steatohepatitis (mononuclear cell and neutrophil infiltration, oval cell hyperplasia, and fibrosis). Compared to the HC group, both the low-dose and the high-dose HC + HO groups showed a significant reduction of  (serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C levels)) and improved liver function (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)). Additionally, compared to the HC group, intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation (IHTC) was significantly higher in the HC + HO group, while the incidence of steatohepatitis was significantly lower. The intake of the HC diet was associated with a higher level of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) and a lower concentration of hepatic antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx, and GST), and all these factors were partially improved in the low-dose and high-dose HC + HO groups.

Despite Institute of Medicine recommendations in 2001 to integrate guidelines for multiple CCs, progress is minimal. The vast number of unique combinations of CCs may limit progress.To determine whether major CCs segregate differentially in limited groups, electronic health record and Medicare paid claims data were examined in one accountable care organization with 44,645 Medicare beneficiaries continuously enrolled throughout 2015. CCs predicting clinical outcomes were obtained from diagnostic codes. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering defined 13 groups having similar within group patterns of CCs and named for the most common CC. Two groups, congestive heart failure (CHF) and kidney disease (CKD), included 23% of beneficiaries with a very high CC burden (10. and 8.1 CCs/beneficiary, respectively). Five groups with 54% of beneficiaries had a high CC burden ranging from 7.1 to .9 (descending order: neurological, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular, chronic pulmonary). Six groups with 23% of beneficiaries had an intermediate-low CC burden ranging from 4.7 to 0.4 (behavioral health, obesity, osteoarthritis, hypertension, , 'other'). Hypertension and  were common across groups, whereas 80% of CHF segregated to the CHF group, 85% of CKD to CKD and CHF groups, 82% of cancer to Cancer, CHF, and CKD groups, and 85% of neurological disorders to Neuro, CHF, and CKD groups. Behavioral health diagnoses were common only in groups with a high CC burden. The number of CCs/beneficiary explained 36% of the variance (R2 = 0.36) in claims paid/beneficiary.Identifying a limited number of groups with high burdens of CCs that disproportionately drive costs may help inform a practical number of integrated guidelines and resources required for comprehensive management. Cluster informed guideline integration may improve care quality and outcomes, while reducing costs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412670>The Lipid Paradox Among Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients-A Retrospective Study of Outcomes and Complications.</a></h1><p>The Studies have suggested hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease. However, few of the studies with a small number of patients had tested the effect of hypercholesterolemia on the outcomes and complications among acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. We hypothesized that lipid disorders (LDs), though risk factors for AIS, were associated with better outcomes and fewer post-stroke complications.We performed a retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (years 2003-2014) in adult hospitalizations for AIS to determine the outcomes and complications associated with LDs, using ICD-9-CM codes. In 2014, we also aimed to estimate adjusted odds of AIS in patients with LDs compared to patients without LDs. The multivariable survey logistic regression models, weighted to account for sampling strategy, were fitted to evaluate relationship of LDs with AIS among 2014 hospitalizations, and outcomes and complications amongst AIS patients from2003-2014.In 2014, there were 28,212,820 (2.02% AIS and .50% LDs) hospitalizations. LDs patients had higher prevalence and odds of having AIS compared with non-LDs. Between 2003-2014, of the total 4,224,924 AIS hospitalizations, 451,645 (10.69%) had LDs. Patients with LDs had lower percentages and odds of mortality, risk of death, major/extreme disability, discharge to nursing facility, and complications including epilepsy, stroke-associated pneumonia, GI-bleeding and hemorrhagic-transformation compared to non-LDs. Although LDs are risk factors for AIS, concurrent LDs in AIS is not only associated with lower mortality and disability but also lower post-stroke complications and higher chance of discharge to home.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391939>Geographic disparities persist despite decline in mortality from IHD in California's Central Valley 1999-2014.</a></h1><p>Nationally, ischemic heart disease mortality has declined significantly due to advancements in managing traditional risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, , smoking, and obesity and acute intervention.

We sought to evaluate the outcome of coronary intervention using PVAD compared with IABP in noncardiogenic shock and nonacute myocardial infarction patients.Using the National Inpatient Sampling (NIS) database from 2005 to 2014, we identified patients who underwent PCI using ICD 9 codes. Patients with cardiogenic shock, acute coronary syndrome, or acute myocardial infarction were excluded. Patient was stratified based on the MCS used, either to PVAD or IABP. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to study PCI outcome using PVAD compared with IABP.Out of 21,848 patients who underwent PCI requiring MCS, 17,270 (79.0%) patients received IABP and 4,578 (21%) patients received PVAD. PVAD patients were older (69 vs. 67, p < .001), were less likely to be women (23.3% vs. 33.3%, p < .001), and had higher rates of hypertension, diabetes,  prior PCI, prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery, anemia, chronic lung disease, liver disease, renal failure, and peripheral vascular disease compared with IABP group (p ≤ .007).

The Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 16 administrative database was searched for individuals 65 years or older between October 1, 1997 to September 30, 1999 who either received a PH but did not have cPTSD (PH+/cPTSD-; n = 1499), had cPTSD without a PH (PH-/cPTSD+; n = 3593), had neither (PH-/cPTSD-; n = 5010), or had both (PH+/cPTSD+; n = 153). In comparison to the control group (PH-/cPTSD-), the PH+/cPTSD- group had increased odds ratios for incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and . The PH-/cPTSD+ group had increased odds ratios for prevalence of diabetes mellitus and for the incidence and prevalence of . The PH-/cPTSD+ and PH+/cPTSD- groups were associated with ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, but not independently of the other risk factors.

However it is associated with rather high expenses, necessitating the selection of effective methods that take local characteristics into account. The 12th district of Budapest has a long tradition of population-based screening for frequent and preventable diseases. The Szent János Hospital hosts an annual stroke screening day. In the present study, previously published data from the 2011 screening were compared with those obtained in 2016, looking for changes and tendencies throughout the examined period.The screening day was conducted in a generally similar way in 2011 and 2016. Similarly to the previous event, the program was organized on a Saturday, the call for the event was spread by the local newspaper. The crew composition was the same. As regards the components of the screening (currently including general history taking, risk status assessment, blood pressure measurement, BMI assessment, cholesterol and blood glucose tests, carotid duplex ultrasonography, and ophthalmological examination), the only difference was the absence of cardiologic examination (it was conducted on an independent day). The anonymous data sheet was the same.The number of participants in the 2016 event was 33, to provide more comfortable conditions. The female predominance was slightly less pronounced but was still present in 2016 (60.6% vs. 72.9%). The mean age became substantially higher (71.2 y vs. 62.9 y). The ratios of participants with higher level of education (97% vs. 94%) and those who are married were still remarkable. The most frequent risk factors were the same; however the ratio of participants with hypertension, 'other heart disease', and diabetes increased, whereas that of with  and obesity decreased. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was unaltered. None of the participants in 2016 admitted smoking (previously this ratio was 20.8%) or drinking heavily. The findings of the carotid ultrasonography revealed a more favorable vascular status. Ophthalmological assessments (predominantly hypertensive alterations on fundoscopy) revealed that the pathological vs. physiological ratio switched to 1:2 from 2:1. The final evaluation of the screening program likewise demonstrated an improved overall state of health of the population.We observed a more favorable stroke risk status of the population in 2016. Whether it is indeed a tendency unknown at present.

Patients with unstable or deteriorating cardiac disease within 6 months before enrollment were ineligible. Medical history at baseline and concomitant CV medication use during treatment were reported. A retrospective, blinded review of AE preferred terms was conducted to identify MACE-plus and bleeding events. Subgroup analyses examined the impact of concomitant CV medication use on how pirfenidone treatment affected clinical outcomes.In total, 1247 patients were included [n = 623 pirfenidone (2403 mg/day) and n = 624 placebo]. The median age was 68 years, 74% were male, and 65% were current/former smokers. Commonly reported CV risk factors included hypertension (52%), obesity (44%), hypercholesterolemia (23%), and  (23%).

This investigation was performed as an observational retrospective cohort study includes 137 patients (age 61 ± 15; 34.3% women) with a primary diagnosis of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent).We collected information about the drug therapy, comorbidities and survival of AF patients and determined their congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or TIA or thromboembolism, vascular disease, age, sex category (CHA2DS2-VASc) scores. Statistical analysis identified patients with high CHA2DS2-VASc scores and defined the predictive value of individual parameters, or their combination, with regards to the outcomes of stroke and mortality.CHA2DS2-VASc scores identified 43.8% of the patients as low to intermediate risk (score 0-1) and 56.2% of the patients as high risk (score ≥2). Increasing CHA2DS2-VASc scores were not only accompanied by an increase in the incidence of stroke (Ptrend < .001) but also by an increase in the 3 to  years mortality (P = .005). Comparison of anticoagulation and anti-aggregation treatment between the 3 groups of AF did not show any significant statistical difference.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been treated well by the use of statins, but hypertriglyceridemia was not the case. Previous fibrates have been shown a certain effect of preventing CVD events, but some remain not enough or even could cause adverse events. Pemafibrate is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α modulator (SPPARMα) with the potential to reduce high triglycerides. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety profile of Pemafibrate, we have started with half dose once-daily administration.Thirty-three patients with hypertriglyceridemia, triglyceride (TG) levels > 150 mg/dL, were treated with Pemafibrate (0.1 mg, once daily) from July 2018 to February 2019. Changes in TG (non-fasting) and LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), creatinine (Cre), blood glucose (PBG) (postprandial), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and body weight (BW) levels were investigated, compared to the baseline levels of the previous visit.Of the 33 patients, 11 were using other fibrates before. Nine were given statins along with. Baseline TG was 285.0 (210. - 423.0) mg/dL, LDL-C 116.4 ± 33.4 mg/dL, and HDL-C 46. ± 12. mg/dL. TG changes were statistically significant (-20.8 ± 47.6%; P < 0.01). Patients with TG > 200 mg/dL, who used fibrates for the first time, experienced the most significant changes in TG levels (-34. ± 37.2%; P < 0.01). In patients using statins already, TG reduction was relatively less, compared to those not using statins (-25.4 ± 36.1%; P < 0.01). HDL-C increased by 3.9 ± 10.2 mg/dL (P < 0.05). LDL-C increased by 16.6 ± 23.7 mg/dL (P < 0.001) in patients not using statins, while patients using statins did not show such significant change. AST, ALT, CK, Cre, PBG, HbA1c and BW did not significantly change.A selective PPARα modulator, Pemafibrate, effectively improved hypertriglyceridemia without major adverse events in real practice, with half dose once-daily administration.

Plasma selenium, fasting blood glucose, blood lipid (total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol) and 2 h OGTT plasma glucose concentration were detected, respectively. The subjects were divided into low, medium and high concentration groups according to the tertiles of plasma selenium concentration in the control group. The multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between plasma selenium exposure and IGR.  The age (mean±) of the case and control group was (53.71±11.38) and (53.95±12.17) years old. The plasma selenium concentration [ ((25), (75))] in the case group was 92.81(77.07, 107.05) μg/L, which was significantly higher than the control group [88.73 (77.13, 100.88) μg/L] (0.05). The results of multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, family history of diabetes and hypertension, the risk of IGR was higher in the high-concentration group and the low-concentration group compared with the middle-concentration group, the values of  (95) were 1.22 (95: 0.94-1.59) and 1.81 (95: 1.42-2.30), respectively.

At present, however, the impact of hypertension on recanalization of coiled aneurysms has not been adequately investigated. This study examined the relation between hypertension and subsequent outcomes of coiled aneurysms, using a matched patient analysis.A total of 715 subjects undergoing coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms between 2011 and 2013 were selected for study. Time-of-flight magnetic resonance or conventional angiography was used (singly or together) to gauge degrees of occlusion after coiling, applying the Raymond classification in grading recanalization. Patients with hypertension were grouped as controlled or uncontrolled, based on blood pressure readings at outpatient clinics. Hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects were matched (1:1) for several relevant variables.Overall, 484 patients (67.7%) were hypertensive (controlled 338; uncontrolled 146). During the follow-up period (28.6 ± 9.7 months), 129 aneurysms (18.0%) displayed recanalization (minor 58; major 71). Patient age, concomitant diabetes, , aneurysm size, neck size, depth-to-neck ratio, and aneurysm type differed significantly in hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups; however, group incidences of cumulative recanalization were similar (p = 0.297). After 1:1 matching the cumulative recanalization rate (13.%) in hypertensive and non-hypertensive counterparts (14.3%) again proved similar (p = 0.578). In the hypertensive group, in addition, recanalization showed no relation to controlled and uncontrolled subgroup (odds ratio, OR = 1.000, p > 0.999).Unlike other aspects of evolving aneurysms (e.g. formation, growth, or rupture), recanalization of coiled aneurysms seems to be unaffected by systemic hypertension.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31463886>Treatment with Free Triple Combination Therapy of Atorvastatin, Perindopril, Amlodipine in Hypertensive Patients: A Real-World Population Study in Italy.</a></h1><p>Polytherapy is often required to treat the comorbidity of hypertension and . Fixed-dose co-formulation, rather than free combinations, simplifies medication taking and also improves adherence to medication, which is the key for a successful management of these conditions.To determine the number of patients potentially eligible for treatment with triple fixed-dose atorvastatin/perindopril/amlodipine (CTAPA), and to estimate if an unmet medical need exists among CTAPA free combination treated patients.This observational retrospective study was based on administrative databases of 3 Italian Local Health Units. The cohort comprised adult patients with at least one prescription of amlodipine and perindopril (either as free combination or co-formulated) and atorvastatin during 2014. Follow-up period started on the date of prescription of the 3 molecules (index date) and lasted 1 year. Adherence to CTAPA was analyzed during follow-up, by using the proportion of days covered (PDC).2292 patients (9.1 per 10,000 beneficiaries) had a prescription for CTAPA as free combination. Only 1249 (54.%) were adherent to the therapy (PDC ≥ 80%); among them, a small percentage required dosage modification. The number of patients with CTAPA increased during the study period. Discontinuation of drugs prescribed the year before interested 582 patients in 2014, and 522 in 2015. Considering the Italian national population (n = 60,782,668), it was estimated that 69,542 hypertensive patients could be eligible for fixed-dose CTAPA during 2014.Real-world analysis among patients with free combination therapy can be applied to estimate the eligible population for fixed combination, and to evaluate the appropriateness of their prescriptions. Moreover, fixed-dose CTAPA could effectively improve adherence, which was calculated to be low in the free combination cohort.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195840>Lipotoxicity-associated inflammation is prevented by guarana () in a model of .</a></h1><p> causes lipotoxicity which prompts an inflammatory response linked to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Natural compounds have been receiving special attention for its potential to treat diseases, inexpensiveness, and safety. Guarana () has demonstrated notable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may prevent chronic diseases caused by changes in lipid profile. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effect of guarana powder () in the purine metabolism and inflammatory profile in lymphocytes and serum of rats with Poloxamer-407-induced . Pretreatment with guarana 12., 25, and 50 mg/kg/day or caffeine (0.2 mg/kg/day) by gavage was applied to adult male Wistar rats for a period of 30 days. As a comparative standard, we used simvastatin (0.04 mg/kg) post-induction.  was acutely induced with intraperitoneally injection of Poloxamer-407 (500 mg/kg). Guarana powder and caffeine increased the activity of the E-NTPDase (ecto-apyrase), and all pretreatments decreased the E-ADA (ecto-adenosine deaminase) activity, reducing the inflammatory process caused by lipotoxicity. In hyperlipidemic rats, ATP levels were increased while adenosine levels were decreased, guarana and caffeine reverted these changes. Guarana powder, caffeine, and simvastatin also prevented the increase in INF-γ and potentiated the increase in IL-4 levels, promoting an anti-inflammatory profile. Guarana promoted a more robust effect than caffeine. Our results show that guarana powder and caffeine have an anti-inflammatory as seen by the shift from a proinflammatory to an anti-inflammatory profile. The effects of guarana were more pronounced, suggesting that guarana powder may be used as a complementary therapy to improve the lipotoxicity-associated inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488210>Cyanidin-3-rutinoside acts as a natural inhibitor of intestinal lipid digestion and absorption.</a></h1><p>Cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C3R), a naturally occurring anthocyanin, possesses anti-oxidant, anti-hyperglycemic, anti-glycation and cardioprotective properties. However, its mechanisms responsible for anti-hyperlipidemic activity have not been fully identified. The aim of the study was to investigate the lipid-lowering mechanisms of C3R through inhibition of lipid digestion and absorption in vitro.The inhibitory activity of C3R against pancreatic lipase and cholesterol esterase was evaluated using enzymatic fluorometric and enzymatic colorimetric assays, respectively. An enzyme kinetic study using Michaelis-Menten and the derived Lineweaver-Burk plot was performed to understand the possible types of inhibition. The formation of cholesterol micelles was determined using the cholesterol assay kit. The bile acid binding was measured using the colorimetric assay. The NBD cholesterol uptake in Caco-2 cells was determined using fluorometric assay. The mRNA expression of cholesterol transporter (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) was determined by RT-PCR.The results showed that C3R was a mixed-type competitive inhibitor of pancreatic lipase with the IC value of 59.4 ± 1.41 μM. Furthermore, C3R (0.125-1 mM) inhibited pancreatic cholesterol esterase about -18%. In addition, C3R inhibited the formation of cholesterol micelles and bound to primary and secondary bile acid. In Caco-2 cells, C3R (12.-100 μM) exhibited a significant reduction in cholesterol uptake in both free cholesterol (17-41%) and mixed micelles (20-30%). Finally, C3R (100 μM) was able to suppress mRNA expression of NPC1L1 in Caco-2 cells after 24 h incubation.The present findings suggest that C3R acts as a lipid-lowering agent through inhibition of lipid digestion and absorption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508438>Diagnostic Criteria for Obesity Disease in Cats.</a></h1><p>Accumulated visceral and subcutaneous fat masses were measured with computed tomography (CT) in cats with various body condition scores (BCS) from /9 to 9/9. BCS does not always reflect visceral fat accumulation which induces pro-inflammatory reactions. Obese cats with accumulated visceral fat showed low plasma adiponectin and high serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations, an inflammatory marker. Based on the above results, new diagnostic criteria for obesity disease were established as follows. For overweight cats with high BCS of >7/9, showing two or more of the following three symptoms, low adiponectin concentrations, , and high SAA concentrations, categorizes them as having obesity disease. Cats with BCS 6/9-9/9, without inflammatory reactions, were classified as simple obesity, which is similar to metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) defined in human medicine. Simple obesity group showed significantly higher adiponectin concentrations than those in control group. The obesity disease group showed significantly higher plasma triglyceride (TG) and SAA concentrations and lower concentrations of adiponectin than the control group. Moreover, plasma glucose and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in the obesity disease group were higher than those in healthy control group, although the differences were not statistically significant.

The aim was to investigate the prevalence of  and the effect of surgical resection.One hundred and thirty-two patients with PPGLs underwent an operation at the National Institutes of Health from 2009 to 2016, of which 54 patients met the inclusion criteria. Clinical demographics, BMI, genetic mutations, tumor size, perioperative catecholamine levels and perioperative lipid panels were retrospectively reviewed. Spearman correlation between catecholamines and lipid levels was evaluated. Paired Wilcoxon and paired t test were used to analyze differences in pre- and postoperative lipid levels.Preoperatively, 51 patients (94.4%) had elevated catecholamines, thirteen (24.1%) had elevated total cholesterol (TC) (>200 mg/dL), nine (16.6%) had elevated LDL (>130 mg/dL) and ten (18.%) had elevated triglycerides (>150 mg/dL).

However, the iron-related harmfulness under a genetic predisposition to atherosclerosis is still unclear. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that chronic iron overload may change vascular reactivity associated with worsening of the atherosclerotic process in apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE(-/-)) mice.Serum and aortas of wild-type (WT) and apoE(-/-) mice injected with iron-dextran (IO, 10 mg/mouse/day, ip) or saline  times a week for 4 weeks, were used.Iron overload increased serum levels of iron and biomarkers of liver injury and oxidative stress, and iron deposition in the aorta in both lines, but only apoE(-/-) IO mice had intensified hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. By scanning electron microscopy, the small endothelial structural damage caused by iron in WT was worsened in the apoE(-/-) group. However, endothelial dysfunction was found only in the apoE(-/-) IO group, identified by impaired relaxation to acetylcholine and hyperreactivity to phenylephrine associated with reduced nitric oxide modulation. Moreover, tiron and indomethacin attenuated reactivity to phenylephrine with greater magnitude in aortas of the apoE(-/-) IO group. Confirming, there were changes in the antioxidant (superoxide dismutase and catalase) activity, increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in the aorta and elevated levels of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin metabolites in the urine of apoE(-/-) IO.Our results showed that chronic iron overload intensifies the atherosclerotic process and induces endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerotic mice, probably due to the oxidative stress and the imbalance between the relaxing and contractile factors synthesized by the damaged endothelium.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In addition to lowering glucose in diabetes, these drugs may also protect against  and arteriosclerosis, which are risk factors for stroke. This is an update of a review first published in January 2014 and subsequently updated in December 2017.To assess the efficacy and safety of PPAR-γ agonists in the secondary prevention of stroke and related vascular events for people with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (30 July 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1949 to 30 July 2019), Embase (1980 to 30 July 2019), CINAHL (1982 to 30 July 2019), AMED (1985 to 30 July 2019), and 11 Chinese databases (30 July 2019). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials, we searched ongoing trials registers, reference lists, and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies. We did not impose any language restrictions.We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating PPAR-γ agonists versus placebo for the secondary prevention of stroke and related vascular events in people with stroke or TIA, with the outcomes of recurrent stroke, vascular events, and adverse events.Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross-checked the data for accuracy, and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias. We evaluated the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.We identified five RCTs with 5039 participants; two studies had a low risk of bias for all domains. Four studies evaluated the drug pioglitazone, and one study evaluated rosiglitazone. The participants in different studies were heterogeneous.Recurrent strokeThree studies evaluated the number of participants with recurrent stroke (4979 participants, a single study contributing 3876 of these). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists probably reduce the recurrence of stroke compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.99; moderate-quality evidence).Adverse eventsEvidence that adverse events occurred more frequently in participants treated with PPAR-γ agonists when compared with placebo was uncertain due to wide confidence interval and high levels of statistical heterogeneity: risk difference 10%, 95% CI -8% to 28%; low-quality evidence).Data were available on additional composite outcomes reflecting serious vascular events (all-cause death and other major vascular events; all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) from one study in 984 people. This study provided low-quality evidence that PPAR-γ agonists led to fewer events (data not meta-analysed).Vascular eventsPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists given over a mean duration of 34. months in a single trial of 984 participants may reduce serious vascular events expressed as a composite outcome of total events of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.99; low-quality evidence).Other outcomesOne study in 20 people measured insulin sensitivity, and one study in 40 people measured the ubiquitin-proteasome activity in carotid plaques. Our confidence in the improvements observed with PPAR-γ agonists were limited by small sample sizes and risk of bias. None of the studies reported the number of participants with disability due to vascular events or improvement in quality of life.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists probably reduce recurrent stroke and total events of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke, and may improve insulin sensitivity and the stabilisation of carotid plaques. Their effects on adverse events are uncertain. Our conclusions should be interpreted with caution considering the small number and the quality of the included studies. Further well-designed, double-blind RCTs with large samples are required to assess the efficacy and safety of PPAR-γ agonists in the secondary prevention of stroke and related vascular events in people with stroke or TIA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440284>Adherence of cardiologist physicians to the American Heart Association guideline in approach to risk factors of cardiovascular diseases: An experience from a teaching hospital.</a></h1><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally and has enormous costs for healthcare systems. This disease has a strong association with lifestyle behaviors. Therefore, applying reliable and effective strategies for prevention and treatment of CVD is important. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the adherence of cardiologist physicians to the American Heart Association (AHA) guideline for prevention of CVD.Using a cross-sectional study, data were gathered for 208 patients using their medical records in the cardiology ward of a general teaching hospital. A physician systematically reviewed the medical records and completed the checklist in each domain. Adherence to the AHA guideline was evaluated in treating physician's choices and recommendations regarding these eight variables: hypertension (HTN), dietary intake, weight management, diabetes management, physical activity, blood lipid management, smoking, and aspirin prescription.Medical records of 208 patients (109 men and 99 women) with the mean age of 62 ± 14 years were reviewed. The frequency of CVDs was .3% for coronary heart failure (HF) and 67.8% for the acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Smokers were younger and less likely to have diabetes mellitus; hypertension; ; or prior myocardial infarction (MI), PCI, or coronary artery bypass grafting. Angiographically, smokers had longer lesions, more complex lesions, and more occlusions, but were less likely to have moderate or severe calcification or tortuosity. At  years, smokers had significantly higher rates of MI (7.8% vs. .6%; p < 0.0001) and definite or probable stent thrombosis (3.% vs. 1.8%; p < 0.0001); however, there were no differences in the rates of death, cardiac death, target lesion revascularization, or composite endpoints (cardiac death, target vessel MI, or ischemic target lesion revascularization). After multivariable adjustment for potential confounders, smoking was a strong independent predictor of death (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.63 to 2.12; p < 0.0001), cardiac death (HR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.38 to 2.05; p < 0.0001), MI (HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.58; p < 0.0001), stent thrombosis (HR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.99; p < 0.0001), and target lesion failure (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.30; p = 0.005).The present large, patient-level, pooled analysis with -year follow-up clearly demonstrates smoking to be an important predictor of adverse outcomes after PCI.Copyright © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Learning, memory and exploration behavior were assessed using the Morris water maze. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α and interleukin (IL)‑1β, were determined by enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. BBB permeability was assessed by Evans blue staining. Relative major facilitator superfamily domain‑containing protein 2 (Mfsd2a) mRNA expression was determined by quantitative PCR. In the Morris water maze test, the time and distance ratio for the surgery group was significantly lower than those of the sham and surgery+Dex groups (P<0.05). In addition, the TNF‑α concentrations in the sham and surgery+Dex groups were lower than that in the surgery group (P<0.05 on days 1 and 3). Evans Blue staining was increased in the surgery group on day 1 (P<0.01). Mfsd2a mRNA expression was higher in the sham and surgery+Dex groups compared with that noted in the surgery group (P<0.05). In conclusion, Dex treatment decreased the incidence of cognitive dysfunction following surgical trauma in a  rat model.

Among the 4 744 PCAD patients included, there were 3 390 (71.%) male aged (47.0±.4) years old and 1 354 (28.%) female aged (57.0±.8) years old. Compared with female patients, male patients had higher body mass index, higher proportion of , smoking, myocardial infarction, previous PCI, preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, radial artery approach, intravenous ultrasound use and chronic occlusive lesions (all 0.05). Age, left ventricular ejection fraction, prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, past stroke history, non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) and the use of calcium channel blockers were lower in male patients than in female patients (all 0.05). The 2-year follow-up results showed that the incidence of BARC type 1 hemorrhage was significantly higher in female patients than in male patients (6.9%(92/1 343) vs. 3.7%(126/3 378), 0.001); however, the incidence of MACCE, all-cause death, cardiac death, recurrent myocardial infarction, revascularization (target vessel revascularization and target lesion revascularization), stent thrombosis, stroke and BARC type 2- hemorrhage were similar between the two groups (all 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that gender was an independent risk factor for BARC type 1 bleeding in PCAD patients (=2.180, 95 1.392-3.416, 0.001), but it was not an independent risk factor for MACCE and BARC type 2- bleeding(all 0.05). , preoperative SYNTAX score, multivessel lesions and NSTE-ACS were the independent risk factors for MACCE in PCAD patients with PCI (the (95%) were 1.289(1.052-1.580), 1.030(1.019-1.042), 1.758(1.365-2.264), 1.264(1.040-1.537), respectively); gender (=1.579, 95 1.085-2.297, 0.017),  (=1.305, 95 1.005-1.695, 0.046), anticoagulant drugs including low molecular weight heparin (=1.321, 95 1.002-1.741, 0.048) or sulfonate(=1.659, 95 1.198-2.298, 0.002) were the independent risk factors for bleeding events.  There are differences in clinical and coronary artery lesion characteristics between different genders in patients with PCAD. The incidence of minor bleeding is significantly higher in female PCAD patients than in male PCAD patients. , preoperative SYNTAX score, multivessel lesions and NSTE-ACS are the independent risk factors for MACCE, and gender, , anticoagulant drugs including low molecular weight heparin or sulfonate are the independent risk factors for bleeding events in patients with PCAD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31327291>National Trends in Statin Medication Prescribing in Patients With a History of Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack.</a></h1><p>Guidelines support statin therapy post-stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); however, previously reported utilization rates are suboptimal.This study investigates the incidence of statin usage in patients with a documented stroke or TIA while identifying predictors of statin use.A retrospective, cross-sectional study utilizing data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.A total of 2963 unweighted visits were included in the analysis, representing a total of 52 645 000 office visits when weighted.

To explore the mechanism by which probiotic-fermented milk improves lipid metabolism, the transcription of genes regulated by liver X receptors (LXRs), '-AMP-activated protein kinase, and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which play integral roles in lipid metabolism, was investigated in hyperlipidemic rats. Compared with rats fed a high-fat diet, the administration of probiotic-fermented milk significantly lowered the levels of total cholesterol (TC) and total triglycerides (TG) in rat serum and viscera ( < 0.05) and significantly increased the level of total bile acid in the rat liver and small intestine ( < 0.05). The quantitative PCR results showed that the probiotics ameliorated the TC levels in the rats by activating the transcription of genes involved in the LXR axis, which promoted TC reverse transport and increased the conversion of TC to bile acids. The level of TG in the hyperlipidemic rats was ameliorated by the inhibition of the transcription of carbohydrate reaction element binding protein genes and activation of the transcription of PPARα genes. The regulation of lipid metabolism-related gene transcription by the single probiotic ( LV108)-fermented milk was more effective than that by the combined probiotic ( LV108,  grx12, and  grx08)-fermented milk ( < 0.05).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663632>Efficacy of Evolocumab vs low-density lipoprotein cholesterol apheresis in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and high cardiovascular risk (EVOLAFER01).</a></h1><p>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis has been considered the last option to treat refractory  in patients with familiar hypercholesterolemia (FH). Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody which has shown significant reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) serum levels and cardiovascular events. The aim of the study was to examine the comparative impact of LDL-apheresis vs Evolocumab vs the combination of both LDL-apheresis and Evolocumab on lipid and lipoprotein parameters, and other metabolic/inflammatory measures.Non-randomized open case series study of 10 adult patients diagnosed with FH already on long-term LDL-apheresis therapy. The study was developed in three consecutive phases to compare LDL-apheresis, Evolocumab treatment and the combination of both. Laboratory parameters were collected pre and post LDL-apheresis and before Evolocumab administration. The primary endpoint was the reduction of LDL-C during the three phases.Reduction of LDL-C levels with Evolocumab were 31.4% vs LDL-apheresis from 153 ± 35 mg/dL to 105 ± 56 mg/dL (P < .001). Reduction of Lp(a) was also significantly higher with Evolocumab (45.%) than LDL-apheresis from 36 (6-119) to 20 (3-41) mg/dL, P = .027. In addition, HDL-C and apo-A increased after Evolocumab treatment, from 41 ± 6 to 46 ± 8 mg/dL (P = .003) and from 124 ± 13 to 144 ± 25 mg/dL (P = .001), respectively. No changes in immunological or inflammatory parameters were observed and no serious adverse events were recorded.Evolocumab reduces LDL-C and Lp(a) more effectively than LDL-apheresis and combination of Evolocumab plus LDL-apheresis could be a therapeutic alternative to get lower LDL-C and Lp(a) levels in patients with very high cardiovascular risk.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665257>Subclinical leaflet thrombosis is associated with impaired reverse remodelling after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.</a></h1><p>Cardiac CT is increasingly applied for planning and follow-up of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, there are no data available on reverse remodelling after TAVI assessed by CT. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the predictors and the prognostic value of left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling following TAVI using CT angiography.We investigated 117 patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent CT scanning before and after TAVI procedure with a mean follow-up time of 2.6 years after TAVI. We found a significant reduction in LV mass (LVM) and LVM indexed to body surface area comparing pre- vs. post-TAVI images: 180. ± 53.0 vs. 137.1 ± 44.8 g and 99.7 ± 25.4 vs. 75.4 ± 19.9 g/m2, respectively, both P < 0.001. Subclinical leaflet thrombosis (SLT) was detected in 25.6% (30/117) patients. More than 20% reduction in LVM was defined as reverse remodelling and was detected in 62.4% (73/117) of the patients. SLT, change in mean pressure gradient on echocardiography and prior myocardial infarction was independently associated with LV reverse remodelling after adjusting for age, gender, and traditional risk factors (hypertension, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and ): OR = 0.27, P = 0.022 for SLT and OR = 0.22, P = 0.006 for prior myocardial infarction, OR = 1.51, P = 0.004 for 10 mmHg change in mean pressure gradient. Reverse remodelling was independently associated with favourable outcomes (HR = 0.23; P = 0.019).TAVI resulted in a significant LVM regression on CT. The presence of SLT showed an inverse association with LV reverse remodelling and thus it may hinder the beneficial LV structural changes. Reverse remodelling was associated with improved long-term prognosis.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author(s) 2019.

This study uses a population-based dataset to examine this question.Data from the National Health Interview Survey were used to identify 13 266 cancer survivors who completed surveys from 2011 to 2015. Prevalence of CVD and associated risk factors, patterns of doctor visitation, and receipt of CVD preventive care were examined. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine factors associated with the receipt of preventive care for survivors with and without CVD risk factors.CVD risk factors were prevalent in older cancer survivors 65 years and older (56.9% with , 66.8% with hypertension) and younger survivors younger than 50 years (35.4% obese, 30.3% current smokers). Rates of blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose monitoring were high, but rates of lifestyle modification were lower (54.8% moderate exercise, 47.1% smoking cessation attempts among smokers). Although 71.% of survivors at 2 years or less from diagnosis saw both general and specialist doctors, only 51.6% of survivors at  or more years saw both, and 43.% saw only a general doctor. On multivariable analysis, receipt of CVD preventive care was strongly associated with general doctor visitation for those with and without CVD risk factors.CVD and associated risk factors are prevalent among both older and younger cancer survivors across the United States. This study identifies areas for improvement related to lifestyle modification in survivors, and also highlights the importance of care transition to the primary care provider for long-term survivors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611267>Relationship between triglyceride levels and ischaemic stroke in elderly hypertensive patients.</a></h1><p>Although  was a well-known risk factor for ischaemic stroke, the association between triglyceride and first ischaemic stroke remains uncertain.The present study attempted to explore the relationship between triglyceride and first ischaemic stroke in a Chinese community elderly patients with hypertension.This was a retrospective cohort study.

Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), malondialdehyde-apoA-I (MDA-apoA-I), paraoxonase1 (PON1), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) are measured in plasma and SI. ATP-binding cassette A1 transporter (ABCA1), ABCG5/G8, liver X receptor α/β (LXRα/β), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and sirtuin1 (SIRT1) are assessed in the SI. Results show that in HL plasma, GIN decreases MDA-apoA-I, MPO/PON1 ratio and increases HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol. In HL-SI, GIN decreases MDA-apoA-I and MPO, increases ApoA-I, PON1, and ABCA1, and restores cholesterol efflux disturbed by HL (SIRT1-LXRα/β-PPARγ-ABCG8). GIN administration is associated with the reduction of the aortic valves lipid-deposits.In HL conditions, GIN stimulates the functional HDL production by restoring apoA-I quality and quantity through inhibition of the oxidative stress, and increases cholesterol efflux in the SI.

A total of 5325 individuals, 18 years of age and older, seen at an academic medical center for the primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack between the years of 2010-2017 were identified using the Kentucky Appalachian Stroke Registry. Descriptive analysis was used to report the prevalence of each comorbidity in the rural population by age group, gender, and level of multimorbidity by looking at concurrent frequencies.Overall, hypertension, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, diabetes, and obesity were the comorbidities with the highest prevalence in our population irrespective of gender. Over 78% (n = 4153) of the individuals had 3 or more comorbidities while 61% (n = 3285) had at least 3 out of the top  comorbidities (hypertension, , tobacco, obesity, diabetes). With respect to age, 15% (n = 795) of the sample was under the age of 50, while 32% (n = 1704) were between the age of 50 and 64 and 53% (n = 2826) of the sample were 65 years or older.The results of this study indicate the majority of individuals affected by stroke in rural Appalachia Kentucky have multimorbidity.

We studied the mechanisms that underlie the cardiotoxic effects of a dual PPARα/γ agonist, tesaglitazar, in wild type and diabetic (leptin receptor deficient - db/db) mice. Mice treated with tesaglitazar-containing chow or high fat diet developed cardiac dysfunction despite lower plasma triglycerides and glucose levels. Expression of cardiac peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), which promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, had the most profound reduction among various fatty acid metabolism genes. Furthermore, we observed increased acetylation of PGC1α, which suggests PGC1α inhibition and lowered sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression. This change was associated with lower mitochondrial abundance. Combined pharmacological activation of PPARα and PPARγ in C57BL/6 mice reproduced the reduction of PGC1α expression and mitochondrial abundance. Resveratrol-mediated SIRT1 activation attenuated tesaglitazar-induced cardiac dysfunction and corrected myocardial mitochondrial respiration in C57BL/6 and diabetic mice but not in cardiomyocyte-specific Sirt1-/- mice. Our data shows that drugs, which activate both PPARα and PPARγ lead to cardiac dysfunction associated with PGC1α suppression and lower mitochondrial abundance likely due to competition between these two transcription factors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31147119>Comparison of forearm versus upper arm basilic transposition arteriovenous fistulas demonstrates equivalent satisfactory patency.</a></h1><p>In accordance with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations, attaining autogenous hemodialysis access, specifically via creation of radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas (AVF), brachial-basilic (BB)-AVF, or brachial-cephalic AVFs, is preferred for mortality and morbidity benefits over catheter access in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study is to determine the suitability of forearm basilic vein transposition (FBVT) fistulas as an alternative access option by comparing outcomes with those of BB-AVFs.All patients who underwent creation of FBVT between 2007 and 2015 were identified retrospectively in the electronic medical record and compared with a sample of patients undergoing BB-AVF placement during this time. Access patency was examined using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression.We included 34 patients with FBVT (median age, 54 years; 67.6% male) and 49 with BB-AVF (median age, 57 years; 42.9% male) in this study. There were no significant differences in comorbid conditions between the two groups, with the exception of  (29.4% FBVT vs 53.1% BB-AVF; P = .03). Although those with FBVT were more likely to have had previous permanent access attempts (70.6% vs 38.7%; P = .002), and access attempts on the same extremity (44.1% vs 24.4%; P = .04), there were no significant differences in primary patency (46.9% vs 53.3%; P = .6), primary-assisted patency (65.6% vs 73.3%; P = .), or secondary patency (68.8% vs 82.2%; P = .2) at 1 year when compared with BB-AVF. The risk of loss of patency was not statistically different for FBVT as compared with BB-AVF (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval 0.65-2.88; P = .4). This risk did not vary for those who had previous access on the same arm (interaction P = .8). Four fistulas in each group failed to mature. Only one infectious complication was identified in the FBVT group.No prior studies have directly compared outcomes of FBVTs with BB-AVFs at 1 year or longer. Despite the increased difficulty of harvesting the forearm basilic vein, particularly in patients who have had prior access attempts, there was no significant difference in patency between FBVTs and BB-AVFs. FBVTs are a reasonable option for hemodialysis access, particularly in patients without adequate cephalic veins or who previously failed radiocephalic fistula attempts.Copyright © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Methods and Results We determined incident coronary artery disease risk for 755 members of 66 hyperlipidemic families (≥2 first-degree relatives with similar ) and 19 644 Finnish FINRISK population study participants. We quantified 151 circulating lipid species from 550 members of 73 hyperlipidemic families and 897 FINRISK participants using mass spectrometric shotgun lipidomics. Familial hypercholesterolemia was excluded using functional LDL receptor testing and genotyping.  ( LDL -C or triacylglycerides >90th population percentile) associated with increased coronary artery disease risk in meta-analysis of the hyperlipidemic families and the population cohort (high LDL -C: hazard ratio, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.48-2.04]; high triacylglycerides: hazard ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.09-1.74]). Risk estimates were similar in the family and population cohorts also after adjusting for lipid-lowering medication. In lipidomic profiling, high LDL -C associated with 108 lipid species, and high triacylglycerides associated with 131 lipid species in either cohort (at % false discovery rate; P-value range 0.038-2.3×10). Lipidomic profiles were highly similar for hyperlipidemic individuals in the families and the population ( LDL -C: r=0.80; triacylglycerides: r=0.96; no lipid species deviated between the cohorts). Conclusions  with family history conferred similar coronary artery disease risk as population-based . We identified distinct lipidomic profiles associated with high LDL -C and triacylglycerides.

Recurrent foot infections, trauma, ischemia, and peripheral neuropathy play a crucial role in predicting foot amputation. The aim of this study is to identify the risk factors of diabetic foot amputations in Pakistani patients. Methods Patients admitted with diabetic foot-related complications were followed throughout their hospital stay. Their sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics were recorded. Patients who were advised foot amputation were taken as group A, and patients who were managed conservatively were termed as group B. Their characteristics were then compared. Results Out of 226 study participants, there were 51 (22.%) patients in group A who were advised foot amputation. There were more men in group A as compared to group B (72.% vs. 30.8%; p<0.00001). Group A also had a longer duration of diabetes (15.23 ± 8.52 years vs. 11.98 ± 9.69; p=0.03). Group B included more patients taking insulin therapy (44.% vs. 37.3%; p=0.002). All three risk factors of atherosclerosis - smoking, , and hypertension - were significantly associated with group A (p≤0.05). This coexistence of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy were more common in group A (p≤0.05). Conclusion The incidence of foot amputation in diabetic patients is high. Crucial risk factors include male gender, smoking, , hypertension, cardiac history, and the coexistence of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170372>VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: PREVALENCE AND COMORBIDITIES IN 6 COUNTRIES OF LATIN AMERICA (A COHORT OF THE DISCOVER STUDY PROGRAM).</a></h1><p> To provide real world observational data about glucose control, the burden of diabetes, comorbidities, and cardiovascular risk factors among patients initiating second-line therapy in Latin America (LA).

The prevalence of microvascular (15.2%), macrovascular (13.8%), and uncontrolled comorbidities in patients at an early stage of the disease (initiating a second-line therapy) highlights the need for more aggressive risk factor screening as well as treatment in LA.  = cardiovascular;  = cardiovascular disease;  = diabetes mellitus;  = hemoglobin A1c;  = Latin America/Latin American;  = low density cholesterol;  = type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658119>Evaluating Association between Coronary Calcifications Visulized During Invasive Coronary Angiography with Total mortality.</a></h1><p>High calcium score is independently associated with a greater cardiac event rate. Using a large data base of patients who underwent coronary angiography for clinical reasons, we evaluated the association between reported degree of coronary calcification with mortality and baseline risk factors.Using angiographic data of 1917 patients from 1993 to 1997, we studied any association between the locations of coronary calcium that were seen during coronary angiography with coronary artery risk factors. Furthermore, we correlated the locations of calcium with all cause mortality.A total of 1917 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization from 1993 to 1997 were studied. Total mortality was 22.9%. There was no association between the classic coronary risk factors (history of hypertension, , smoking, diabetes mellitus and family history) or race (Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, and Asian) with the occurrence of angiographic visible calcium in any location. Furthermore, we did not find any association between the locations of coronary calcium with all cause mortality. (All cause mortality occurred in 21.8 % of patients with left main calcification vs. 23.3 %, p=0.63, in 24.6% of patients with left anterior descending artery calcification vs. 22.7%, p=0.48, in 25.6% of patients with circumflex calcification vs. 23.1%, p=0.52, in 25.7% of right coronary calcification vs. 22.7%, p=0.47, in 24.6 of any coronary calcification vs. 22.%, p=0.4 ).Race, coronary risk factors, and all cause mortality are not associated with angiographic documented coronary calcification in any location in patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619421>Multiple chronic conditions at a major urban health system: a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of frequencies, costs and comorbidity patterns.</a></h1><p>To (1) examine the burden of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) in an urban health system, and (2) propose a methodology to identify subpopulations of interest based on diagnosis groups and costs.Retrospective cross-sectional study.Mount Sinai Health System, set in all five boroughs of New York City, USA.192 085 adult (18+) plan members of capitated Medicaid contracts between the Healthfirst managed care organisation and the Mount Sinai Health System in the years 2012 to 2014.We classified adults as having 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or + chronic conditions from a list of 69 chronic conditions. After summarising the demographics, geography and prevalence of MCC within this population, we then described groups of patients (segments) using a novel methodology: we combinatorially defined 18 768 potential segments of patients by a pair of chronic conditions, a sex and an age group, and then ranked segments by (1) frequency, (2) cost and (3) ratios of observed to expected frequencies of co-occurring chronic conditions. We then compiled pairs of conditions that occur more frequently together than otherwise expected.61.% of the study population suffers from two or more chronic conditions. The most frequent dyad was hypertension and  (19%) and the most frequent triad was diabetes, hypertension and  (10%). Women aged 50 to 65 with hypertension and  were the leading cost segment in the study population. Costs and prevalence of MCC increase with number of conditions and age. The disease dyads associated with the largest observed/expected ratios were pulmonary disease and myocardial infarction. Inter-borough range MCC prevalence was 16%.In this low-income, urban population, MCC is more prevalent (61%) than nationally (42%), motivating further research and intervention in this population. By identifying potential target populations in an interpretable manner, this segmenting methodology has utility for health services analysts.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

MRI-visible perivascular spaces (PVS) are a sensitive neuroimaging marker of SVD. We aimed to explore the risk factors and associations with other SVD markers of PVS in two topographical regions (in the basal ganglia [BG] and centrum semiovale [CS]) in a cohort of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients.  We included 306 consecutive patients from a prospective spontaneous ICH cohort. We rated PVS, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebral microbleeds (CMB), and lacunes with validated visual rating scale. We collected clinical information using standardized forms. We predefined severe PVS as score > 2 and examined associations between PVS in both BG and CS regions and clinical and imaging markers of SVD by logistic regression.  In the multivariable logistic regression, increasing age (OR = 1.075; 95% CI = 1.038-1.113,  < 0.001), high CS PVS degrees (OR = 6.906; 95% CI = 3.024-15.774,  < 0.001), extensive periventricular WMH (OR = 2.878; 95% CI = 1.298-6.379,  = 0.009), and the presence of CMB (OR = 4.073, 95% CI = 1.869-8.877,  < 0.001) were independently associated with BG PVS severity. Alcohol-drinking habit (OR = 2.805; 95% CI = 1.451-.422,  = 0.002),  history (OR = 3.782; 95% CI = 1.582-8.783,  = 0.003), high BG PVS degrees (OR = 6.293; 95% CI = 2.755-14.371,  < 0.001) and the presence of strictly lobar CMB (OR = 2.556, 95% CI = 1.285-.085,  = 0.008) were independent predictors of increased CS PVS severity.  MRI-visible PVS in BG and CS regions are inter-related and have different risk factors in spontaneous ICH patients. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanism and clinical importance of PVS, with possible implications for cerebrovascular disease prevention and effective treatments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508609>Effects of Periodontal Intervention on Levels of Serum High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein and Interleukin 6, and on Carotid Artery in Rats with Chronic Periodontitis and .</a></h1><p>To investigate the effects of nonsurgical periodontal therapy on the serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and on the carotid artery in rats with chronic periodontitis (CP) and with or without  (HL).A total of 29 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: group A (CP, n = 14) and B (CP + HL, n = 15), and subjected to the corresponding treatment. Groups A and B were further divided into groups A1/B1 (without periodontal interventions) and A2/B2 (with periodontal interventions). The serum IL-6 and hsCRP levels were evaluated before periodontal intervention and at 1, 3, , and 7 weeks after periodontal intervention. The rats were euthanised 8 weeks after the periodontal intervention and the histopathologic changes in the carotid artery were observed.The serum hsCRP and serum IL-6 levels in groups A1 and B1 were elevated with time; they were significantly higher in group B1 than in group A1 (P < 0.001) at all time points. The hsCRP and IL-6 levels in groups A2 and B2 increased with time and reached the maximum level 1 week after the second intervention, and then gradually decreased. Atherosclerotic plaques, fibrous cap, and calcium salt deposits were apparent in the rats of group B1, whereas no obvious atherosclerotic changes were observed in the rats of groups A2 and B2.Periodontal interventions resulted in acute, short-term systemic inflammation. However, it was beneficial in long-term as it improved the carotid artery integrity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501611>Contribution of genetics to visceral adiposity and its relation to cardiovascular and metabolic disease.</a></h1><p>Visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-fat stored around the internal organs-has been suggested as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease, as well as all-cause, cardiovascular-specific and cancer-specific mortality. Yet, the contribution of genetics to VAT, as well as its disease-related effects, are largely unexplored due to the requirement for advanced imaging technologies to accurately measure VAT. Here, we develop sex-stratified, nonlinear prediction models (coefficient of determination = 0.76; typical 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74-0.78) for VAT mass using the UK Biobank cohort. We performed a genome-wide association study for predicted VAT mass and identified 102 novel visceral adiposity loci. Predicted VAT mass was associated with increased risk of hypertension, heart attack/angina, type 2 diabetes and , and Mendelian randomization analysis showed visceral fat to be a causal risk factor for all four diseases. In particular, a large difference in causal effect between the sexes was found for type 2 diabetes, with an odds ratio of 7.34 (95% CI = 4.48-12.0) in females and an odds ratio of 2.50 (95% CI = 1.98-3.14) in males. Our findings bolster the role of visceral adiposity as a potentially independent risk factor, in particular for type 2 diabetes in Caucasian females. Independent validation in other cohorts is necessary to determine whether the findings can translate to other ethnicities, or outside the UK.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534873>Cross-reaction of angioedema with clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine: A case report.</a></h1><p>Angioedema is characterized by marked swelling of the subcutaneous or submucosal tissue and may affect various parts of the body, including the face, mouth, and extremities. Angioedema has specifically been associated with the use of several antipsychotic agents, including clozapine, olanzapine, iloperidone, haloperidol, quetiapine, paliperidone, ziprasidone, risperidone, and chlorpromazine. A 67-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease requiring stent placement, mitral insufficiency, , tobacco use disorder, and schizophrenia presented with altered mental status and disorientation in the setting of clozapine nonadherence, which prompted acute hospitalization for clozapine reinitiation. During clozapine titration, the patient developed edema, erythema, and pruritus on his face and arms along with lip swelling characteristic of angioedema. Upon discontinuation of clozapine, the patient was trialed on several other antipsychotic medications to help manage acute psychosis and subsequently developed angioedema symptoms with trials of both olanzapine and quetiapine. Following these 3 distinct events of angioedema, the clinical decision was made to no longer trial atypical antipsychotics for the patient, and loxapine was cautiously initiated. The patient responded well to loxapine and continued to tolerate loxapine therapy for years. This case report identifies angioedema cross-reaction linked with 3 second-generation antipsychotics. Given the potentially life-threatening nature of angioedema, awareness of recurrent angioedema should be undertaken when trialing antipsychotics following an episode of angioedema correlated to antipsychotic use, particularly when trialing antipsychotics from the same generation and with similar chemical structures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447889>The utility of coronary computed tomography angiography in elderly patients.</a></h1><p>Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is often avoided in elderly patients due to a presumption that a high proportion of patients will have heavily calcified plaque limiting an accurate assessment. We sought to assess the image quality, luminal stenosis and utility of CCTA in elderly patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) and stable chest pain.Retrospective analysis of elderly patients (> 75 years) who underwent 320-detector row CCTA between 2012-2017 at MonashHeart. The CCTA was analysed for degree maximal coronary stenosis by CAD-RADS classification, image quality by a -point Likert score (1-poor, 2-adequate, 3-good, 4-very good, -excellent) and presence of artefact limiting interpretability.1011 elderly patients (62% females, 78.8 ± 3.3 years) were studied. Cardiovascular risk factor prevalence included: hypertension (65%),  (48%), diabetes (19%) and smoking (21%). The CCTA was evaluable in 68% of patients which included 52% with non-obstructive CAD (< 50% stenosis), 48% with obstructive CAD (> 50%) stenosis. Mean Likert score was 3.1 ± 0.6 corresponding to good image quality. Of the 323 (32%) of patients with a non-interpretable CCTA, 80% were due to calcified plaque and 20% due to motion artefact. Male gender ( = 0.009), age ( = 0.02), excess motion ( < 0.01) and diabetes mellitus ( = 0.03) were associated with non-interpretable CCTA.Although CCTA is a feasible non-invasive tool for assessment of elderly patients with stable chest pain, clinicians should still be cautious about referring elderly patients for CCTA.

Regulators of this intestinal chylomicron transport include among others the autonomous nervous system, transcription factors like PLAGL2, and molecular regulators, such as VEGF-A/Nrp1/VEGFR1, VEGF-C/VEGFR3, DLL4, CALCRL and GLP-2. Chylomicron transport in intestinal lymphatics is now emerging not only as an option for drug delivery but also as a new candidate for drug targeting in lipid-related disorders.Dysfunctions of lymphatic lipid transport can result in conditions such as dyslipidaemia. Intestinal lymphatics also provide several potential therapeutic possibilities: molecular regulation of lacteal cell-to-cell junctioning and lymph flow could provide new ways of treating conditions like  and associated diseases, such as atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes and fatty-liver disease. The intestinal lymphatic system can also be employed to deliver lipid nanoparticles as drug carriers to the venous circulation for improved treatment outcome. These findings highlight the importance and need for research on the different players of intestinal lymphatics in dietary lipid handling and therapeutic applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322084>[Own and Parental Predictors of Hypertriglyceridemia in Children of Persons with Early Ischemic Heart Disease].</a></h1><p>to elucidate predictors of high level of basal triglycerides (TG) in blood of children of persons with early (onset: men ≤55, women ≤60 years) ischemic heart disease (EIHD).We examined 316 families: patients (probands) (n=295; 77.9 % after MI) with EIHD, their spouses (n=219; 83.1 % women) and native children of probands (n=413; 55.7 % men) aged -38 years. In children aged -17 and 18-38 years proband's spouse was mother in 88 and 77 % of cases, respectively.

However, there are serious gaps in our understanding of IL-1 production in atherosclerosis. Herein the authors show that complex plaques, or plaques derived from patients with suboptimally controlled , or on no or low-intensity statin therapy, demonstrated higher recruitable IL-1β production. Generation of mature IL-1β was matched by IL-1α release, and both were attenuated by inhibition of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 or caspase. These findings support the inflammasome as the main pathway for IL-1α/β generation in atherosclerosis and high-intensity lipid-lowering therapies as primary and additional anti-IL-1-directed therapies as secondary interventions in high-risk patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31349779>Prevalence of  in adults and its relation to the Mediterranean diet: the Hellenic National Nutrition and Health Survey (HNNHS).</a></h1><p>A long-term abnormal blood lipid profile increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A probable protective role may be played by the Mediterranean diet. The aim of this study was to assess prevalence of dyslipidaemia, assess blood lipid status and treatment and examine the association between blood lipids, dyslipidaemia and Mediterranean diet.Data were from the Hellenic National Nutrition and Health Survey (HNNHS). Data from 3775 adults (40.8% males) were obtained by trained personnel and disease status was categorized according to the International Classification of Diseases codes (10th version). Blood lipid measurements were obtained from a subsample ( = 1080, mean age 40.1 years; 37.8% male). The Mediterranean diet score (MedDiet score) was calculated from 24-h recalls. The relationships between higher MedDiet score (>23), lipid levels and status were examined using linearized multiple linear and logistic regressions, respectively.In total, 20.7% of the population was dyslipidaemic, with 59.0% (no sex differences) receiving treatment, and 46.6% of the treated having a normal lipid profile. Lipid status awareness was 35.% (64.% unaware). Males aged 19-39 had higher total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than females (in mg/dl;  for all <0.05); these were significantly higher in overweight and obese individuals in all age groups, except high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( for all <0.001). Higher MedDiet score was associated with significantly lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the pooled sample (-6.39 mg/dl; 95% confidence interval (CI): -12.60, 0.17), in all males (-10.61 mg/dl; 95% CI: -19.89, -1.34) and in overweight and obese males (-15.6 mg/dl; 95% CI: -29.25, -1.94).This study underlines the abnormal lipid profile in the young, mostly male, population who are highly unaware and under-treated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174318>Evaluation of the Association of Omentin 1 rs2274907 A>T and rs2274908 G>A Gene Polymorphisms with Coronary Artery Disease in Indian Population: A Case Control Study.</a></h1><p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of death all over the world. CAD is caused by atherosclerosis which is induced by the interaction of genetic factors and environmental factors. Traditional environmental risk factors include , diabetes mellitus, lack of exercise, obesity, poor diet and others. Genome-wide association studies have revealed the association of certain gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to CAD. Omentin 1 is an adipokine secreted by the visceral adipose tissues and has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and enhances insulin sensitivity. In this study, we examined the role of omentin-1 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2274907 A>T and rs2274908 G>A) in CAD. We genotyped 100 CAD patients and 100 matched healthy controls from the south Indian population using an amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS-PCR) and allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR). Our result indicated the rs2274908 G>A is not associated with CAD. Results showed that there was a significant difference in rs2274907 A>T genotype distribution between controls and CAD cases (-value < 0.05). Results indicated that the AT genotype of the rs2274907 is associated with CAD with OR = 3.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.64 to .49), 1.65 (1.27 to 2.163),  = 0.002. The T allele of the rs2274907 was also associated with CAD with OR = 1.82 (95% CI, 1.193 to 2.80), 1.37 (1.08 to 1.74),  = 0.005. Rs2274907 genotype distribution was also correlated with serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), hypertension and diabetes. We conclude that the AT genotype and the T allele of the rs2274907 A>T is associated with Cad in the south Indian population. Further studies on the effect of the rs2274907 A>T on omentin-1 function are recommended, and future well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and in different populations are required to validate our findings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360316>Lipid Control in Patients with Diabetes across Primary and Tertiary Government Health Sectors in Dubai: A Five-year Pattern.</a></h1><p>A key aspect for the prevention of vascular complications in diabetes is control of , and that has always been a global challenge. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the UAE is estimated to be 18.98%. However, despite this high prevalence, very few studies have evaluated the control of lipids in patients with diabetes in our region. We sought to assess lipid control in patients with diabetes across the different sectors of the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) over five years (2012-2016). Additionally, we aimed to compare lipids control in both primary and tertiary care as well as between nationalities and diabetes types.We conducted a retrospective analysis of the electronic medical records of all patients within the DHA over five years. All patients with diabetes were included, and evaluation of lipids panel control was done according to the American Diabetes Association standards.This review includes a total of 26 447 patients. The mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was lower in tertiary care patients across the years. Annual means of all lipid parameters were higher in primary care patients. Around 60.% of patients achieved LDL levels < 100 mg/dL. Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels < 130 mg/dL were achieved in 67.9% of patients in tertiary care in 2012 compared to 60.9% in primary care. UAE nationals had better lipids control across the study duration compared to expatriates.This is the largest cohort of patients evaluated for diabetes and lipids control in the UAE and the Middle East region. The percentage of patients with diabetes across the DHA primary and tertiary health care centers achieving lipid targets is amongst the highest reported in the region and, perhaps, globally. Significantly better lipid control indices were achieved in tertiary care compared to primary care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315602>The combined presence of hypertension and vitamin D deficiency increased the probability of the occurrence of small vessel disease in China.</a></h1><p>The exact relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] levels and small vessel disease (SVD) are not clear in China. The aim of this study was to determine such the association between 25(OH) D and SVD in China.We retrospectively enrolled 106 patients with SVD and 115 controls between Jan 2017 and Dec 2017. All the subjects were categorized into three subgroups according to the level of 25 (OH) D: vitamin D deficiency (< 12 ng/ml), insufficiency (12-20 ng/ml) and sufficiency (> 20 ng/ml).Among 106 SVD patients, 80 (75.%) were men and the mean age was 61.6 ± 13.2 years. The deficiency of 25(OH) D was observed in 76 (71.7%) of SVD patients and 47 (40.9%) of controls (P = 0.001). Compared with controls, patients with SVD were more likely to be male, a stroke history, smokers, with , higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein, and lower of 25(OH)D level (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed the level of 25 (OH) D as an independent predictor of SVD (OR 0.772, 95% CI 0.691-0.862, P = 0.001). Compared with the sufficient 25 (OH) D group, the ORs of SVD in deficient and insufficient 25(OH)D group were .609 (95% CI 2.006-15.683) and 1.077 (95% CI: 0.338-3.428) after adjusting for potential confounders, respectively. In hypertensives with vitamin D deficient and insufficient group compared with sufficient group, the ORs of SVD increased to 9.738 (95% CI 2.398-39.540) and 1.108 (95% CI 0.232-.280), respectively (P = 0.001).We found significant associations between SVD and 25(OH)D deficiency. The combined presence of hypertension and vitamin D deficiency increased the probability of developing SVD.

Stimulation of glucose transport is markedly impaired in cardiomyocytes chronically exposed to excess free fatty acids (FFA), as occurs in vivo in type 2 diabetes. To determine whether chronic low-grade activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) improves substrate metabolism in cardiomyocytes exposed to FFA, isolated cultured cardiomyocytes were exposed for 7 days to FFA ± the AMPK agonist -aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR). Glucose transport and glycolysis were then measured during acute metabolic stress provoked by oligomycin. Chronic treatment with AICAR improved basal and oligomycin-stimulated glucose transport in FFA-exposed but not in control cardiomyocytes. Similarly, basal and oligomycin-stimulated glycolysis was reduced in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes but restored by chronic AICAR treatment. Conversely, fatty acid oxidation was increased in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes and reduced by chronic AICAR treatment. Chronic AICAR treatment induced in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes the biogenesis of numerous lipid droplets. Curiously, whereas acute treatment of cardiomyocytes with AICAR increased phosphorylation of the AMPKα subunit on T, a classical marker of AMPK activation, chronic AICAR treatment almost completely obliterated T phosphorylation. However, phosphorylation of the AMPK target protein raptor on S was reduced in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes but restored by AICAR treatment. In conclusion, chronic AICAR treatment induces a metabolic shift in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes, characterized by improved glucose transport and glycolysis and redirection of fatty acids towards neutral storage. Such metabolic changes in vivo could protect the hearts of patients with type 2 diabetes against ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402326>Determinants of glycemic control: Phase 2 analysis from nationwide diabetes report of National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes (NPPCD-2018).</a></h1><p>Diabetes is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially among middle and low income nations.

Poor glycemic control was associated with male gender (OR=1.06, p=0.001), obesity (OR=1.03, p=0.05), duration of diabetes (OR=1.018, p<0.001), smoking (OR=1.08, p=0.041), hypertension (OR=1.53, p<0.001),  (OR=1.15, p<0.001), insulin therapy (OR=1.26, p<0.001) and combination of insulin and oral anti-diabetic agents compared to oral anti-diabetic agents alone (OR=2.36, p<0.001).We demonstrated that the prevalence of diabetes comorbidities is high in Iranian population and that a great proportion of Iranian patients with diabetes had not reached the goal of glycemic control. Our findings provide a starting point from which to investigate the obstacles that prevent patients with diabetes from reaching metabolic targets.Copyright © 2019 Primary Care Diabetes Europe.

It is unknown whether customized birth weight charts better identify newborns at risk of long-term adverse outcomes than population birth weight charts. We aimed to examine whether birth weight classification according to customized charts is superior to population charts at identification of newborns at risk of adverse cardio-metabolic and respiratory health outcomes.In a population-based prospective cohort study among 6052 pregnant women and their children, we measured infant catch-up growth, overweight, high blood pressure, , liver steatosis, clustering of cardio-metabolic risk factors, and asthma at age 10. Small size and large size for gestational age at birth was defined as birth weight in the lowest or highest decile, respectively, of population or customized charts. Association with birth weight classification was assessed using logistic regression models.Of the total of 605 newborns classified as small size for gestational age by population charts, 150 (24.8%) were reclassified as appropriate size for gestational age by customized charts, whereas of the total of 605 newborns classified as large size for gestational age by population charts, 129 (21.3%) cases were reclassified as appropriate size for gestational age by customized charts. Compared to newborns born appropriate size for gestational age, newborns born small size for gestational age according to customized charts had increased risks of infant catch-up growth (odds ratio (OR) .15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.22 to 6.29)), high blood pressure (OR 2.05 (95% CI 1.55 to 2.72)), and clustering of cardio-metabolic risk factors at 10 years (OR 1.66 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.34)). No associations were observed for overweight, , liver steatosis, or asthma. Newborns born large-size for gestational age according to customized charts had higher risk of catch-down-growth only (OR 3.84 (95% CI 3.22 to 4.59)). The direction and strength of the observed associations were largely similar when we used classification according to population charts.Small-size-for-gestational-age newborns seem to be at risk of long-term adverse cardio-metabolic health outcomes, irrespective of the use of customized or population birth weight charts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484341>Evaluation of an Eight-Week Whole-Food Plant-Based Lifestyle Modification Program.</a></h1><p>Poor diet quality is the leading cause of death both in the United States and worldwide, and the prevalence of obesity is at an all-time high and is projected to significantly worsen. Results from an eight-week group program utilizing an ad-libitum whole-food plant-based dietary pattern, were reviewed. There were 79 participants, all self-referred from the community, including 24 (30.4%) who were already vegetarian or vegan at baseline. Seventy-eight participants (98.7%) completed the eight-week program. Among completers, those with higher BMI at baseline lost a larger percentage of their body weight (total body weight loss of 3.0 ± SD 2.1%, .8 ± 2.8%, and 6.4 ± 2.% for participants who had baseline BMI in normal, overweight, and obese range, respectively). The average weight loss for all the completers was . ± 3.0 kg ( 0.0001). Final blood pressure and plasma lipids were reduced compared to baseline (SBP decreased 7.1 ± 15. mmHg ( = 0.0002), DBP decreased 7.3 ± 10.9 mmHg ( 0.0001), total cholesterol decreased 25.2 ± 24.7 mg/dL ( 0.0001), LDL decreased 15.3 ± 21.1 mg/dL ( 0.0001)). Twenty-one (26.9%) participants were able to decrease or stop at least one chronic medication compared to two (2.6%) participants who required an increased dose of a chronic medication. Participants who were already vegetarian or vegan at baseline experienced statistically significant weight loss and reductions in total and LDL cholesterol. There was a non-significant trend toward less weight loss in these participants compared to participants who were non-vegetarian at baseline. Reductions in total and LDL cholesterol were not significantly different when comparing vegetarian or vegan and non-vegetarian participants. A whole-food plant-based dietary intervention may provide significant short-term benefits for both non-vegetarian, vegetarian, and vegan individuals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532959>Polypill for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in an Underserved Population.</a></h1><p>Persons with low socioeconomic status and nonwhite persons in the United States have high rates of cardiovascular disease. The use of combination pills (also called "polypills") containing low doses of medications with proven benefits for the prevention of cardiovascular disease may be beneficial in such persons. However, few data are available regarding the use of polypill therapy in underserved communities in the United States, in which adherence to guideline-based care is generally low.We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving adults without cardiovascular disease. Participants were assigned to the polypill group or the usual-care group at a federally qualified community health center in Alabama. Components of the polypill were atorvastatin (at a dose of 10 mg), amlodipine (2. mg), losartan (25 mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (12. mg). The two primary outcomes were the changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level at 12 months.The trial enrolled 303 adults, of whom 96% were black. Three quarters of the participants had an annual income below $15,000. The mean estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk was 12.7%, the baseline blood pressure was 140/83 mm Hg, and the baseline LDL cholesterol level was 113 mg per deciliter. The monthly cost of the polypill was $26. At 12 months, adherence to the polypill regimen, as assessed on the basis of pill counts, was 86%. The mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 9 mm Hg in the polypill group, as compared with 2 mm Hg in the usual-care group (difference, -7 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -12 to -2; P = 0.003). The mean LDL cholesterol level decreased by 15 mg per deciliter in the polypill group, as compared with 4 mg per deciliter in the usual-care group (difference, -11 mg per deciliter; 95% CI, -18 to -; P<0.001).A polypill-based strategy led to greater reductions in systolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol level than were observed with usual care in a socioeconomically vulnerable minority population.

We investigated the effect of amygdalin on the cell death and the level of pro-apoptotic Bax protein and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cell line. The cell viability of SK-BR-3 cells was evaluated by MTT assay in different concentration of amygdalin. The level of Bax and Bcl-2 in SK-BR-3 cells were measured by western blot analysis. For statistical analysis, One-way ANOVA was used for the comparison of Bax and Bcl-2 protein level and percent of cell viability between groups. The molecular docking studies of amygdalin within the Bcl-2 (PDB ID: 4LVT) and HER2 (PDB ID: 3RCD) active site, were performed using AutoDock 4.2.. Amygdalin induced a significant reduction of cell viability in SK-BR-3 after 24-h treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Also, amygdalin causes an increase in pro-apoptotic Bax protein and a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression in the SK-BR-3 cells. Molecular docking studies showed that amygdalin interacts with the active site amino acids of Bcl-2 and HER2 through hydrogen bonding and some hydrophobic interactions. Amygdalin can induce apoptotic death in SK-BR-3 cells by increasing pro-apoptotic Bax protein and decreasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. The results suggest that amygdalin may be a valuable candidate for the treatment of breast cancer, especially in HER2 positive cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468074>Case-control study on the association between the GATA2 gene and premature myocardial infarction in the Iranian population.</a></h1><p>In recent decades, due to the high prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI), numerous studies have attempted to elucidate genetic contributing factors in these complex disorders. A very interesting gene in this regard is GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2), an important regulator of various gene expressions in vascular endothelial cells. Accordingly, the association of different GATA2 polymorphisms with CAD and MI has already been evaluated. Rs2713604 is a genetic marker whose association with CAD has not been reproduced in previous studies. Considering the importance of replicating the initial association, the present case-control study aimed to examine the association of this intronic variant with premature MI in a sample of the Iranian population. In this study, 193 participants from Jahrom Hospital (Jahrom, Iran) were consecutively recruited during a 1.-year period, and, following blood sampling, genomic DNA was extracted. We then proceeded to genotype rs2713604 using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and statistically analyzed the data. After adjustment for , hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, the results of the multivariate regression analysis showed no significant association between rs2713604 and premature MI. Interestingly, the risk allele (A-allele) of rs2713604 displayed a slightly higher frequency among controls compared to cases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309602>Diabetes Is Associated With Increased Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients With Cirrhosis From Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Diabetes increases the risk of liver disease progression and cirrhosis development in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The association between diabetes and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in NASH patients with cirrhosis is not well quantified. All patients with the diagnosis of NASH cirrhosis seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester between January 2006 and December 2015 were identified. All adult liver transplant registrants with NASH between 2004 and 2017 were identified using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplantation registry for external validation. Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to investigate the association between diabetes and HCC risk. Among 354 Mayo Clinic patients with NASH cirrhosis, 253 (71%) had diabetes and 145 (41%) were male. Mean age at cirrhosis evaluation was 62. During a median follow-up of 47 months, 30 patients developed HCC. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of developing HCC in univariate (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-11.9; P = 0.04) and multivariable analysis (HR = 4.2; 95% CI = 1.2-14.2; P = 0.02). In addition, age (per decade, HR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.2-2.6; P < 0.01) and low serum albumin (HR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.-2.9; P < 0.01) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing HCC in multivariable analysis. Other metabolic risk factors, including body mass index, , and hypertension, were not associated with HCC risk. Among UNOS NASH registrants (N = 6,630), 58% had diabetes. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of developing HCC in univariate (HR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.1-1.8; P < 0.01) and multivariable (HR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0-1.7; P = 0.03) analysis.

He presented with right hemiparesis in September 2017. He had no history of hypertension, diabetes, , heart disease, or smoking. Brain MRI revealed a border-zone infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere and a rapidly progressing severe left internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. He was initiated on clopidogrel and bosutinib instead of nilotinib. He presented with right hemiparesis once again in December 2017. Brain MRI revealed the border-zone infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere and a more progressed, severe bilateral ICA stenosis. A carotid ultrasound demonstrated iso-intense and concentrically narrowed ICA on both sides. Carotid artery stenting of the left ICA was performed in February 2018, and clopidogrel was replaced by cilostazol to provide a drug-induced rush. Carotid artery stenting of the right ICA was performed in June 2018 and cervical angiogram demonstrated that there were no residual artery stenoses in the bilateral stent. In recent years, several case reports suggest that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are associated with progressive artery stenosis and cause cerebral infarction.

The aims of this case-control study in patients with AF were to identify the pathogenesis of and the risk factors for cerebrovascular ischemic events occurring during non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) therapy for stroke prevention. Methods- Cases were consecutive patients with AF who had acute cerebrovascular ischemic events during NOAC treatment. Controls were consecutive patients with AF who did not have cerebrovascular events during NOACs treatment. Results- Overall, 713 cases (641 ischemic strokes and 72 transient ischemic attacks; median age, 80.0 years; interquartile range, 12; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission, 6.0; interquartile range, 10) and 700 controls (median age, 72.0 years; interquartile range, 8) were included in the study. Recurrent stroke was classified as cardioembolic in 455 cases (63.9%) according to the A-S-C-O-D (A, atherosclerosis; S, small vessel disease; C, cardiac pathology; O, other causes; D, dissection) classification. On multivariable analysis, off-label low dose of NOACs (odds ratio [OR], 3.18; 95% CI, 1.95-.85), atrial enlargement (OR, 6.64; 95% CI, 4.63-9.52),  (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.83-3.16), and CHADS-VASc score (OR, 1.72 for each point increase; 95% CI, 1.58-1.88) were associated with ischemic events. Among the CHADS-VASc components, age was older and presence of diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and history of stroke or transient ischemic attack more common in patients who had acute cerebrovascular ischemic events. Paroxysmal AF was inversely associated with ischemic events (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.33-0.61). Conclusions- In patients with AF treated with NOACs who had a cerebrovascular event, mostly but not exclusively of cardioembolic pathogenesis, off-label low dose, atrial enlargement, , and high CHADS-VASc score were associated with increased risk of cerebrovascular events.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475545>Atherosclerosis in cancer patients.</a></h1><p>Cancer-related mortality have been declining in the last decades. Approximately half of adults and more than two thirds of children oncological patients live longer than  years after diagnosis. However, this optimistic scenario has been counterbalanced by an increasing cardiovascular risk in cancer patients. Atherosclerotic damage has been underestimated in oncology practice for a long time, but recently a significant number of cancer patients with cardiovascular risk factors and serious artery disease during and after anticancer therapy has been reported. Complexity of atherosclerosis in cancer patients is challenging. Herein, we describe cardiovascular risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms of atherosclerosis induced by selected classic chemotherapeutics, targeted cancer therapies, hormonal agents and radiotherapy and new clinical data regarding atherosclerosis, which received a particular attention in recent years (Tab. 1, Ref. 26).

In this study, we use a population-based approach using electronic health record ( EHR )-based algorithms to identify FH . We report the major adverse cardiovascular events, mortality, and cost of medical care associated with this diagnosis. Methods and Results In our 1.18 million EHR- eligible cohort, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ( ICD -9) code-defined  was categorized into FH and non- FH groups using an EHR algorithm designed using the modified Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria. Major adverse cardiovascular events, mortality, and cost of medical care were analyzed. A priori associated variables/confounders were used for multivariate analyses using binary logistic regression and linear regression with propensity score-based weighted methods as appropriate. EHR FH was identified in 32 613 individuals, which was 2.7% of the 1.18 million EHR cohort and 13.7% of 237 903 patients with . FH had higher rates of myocardial infarction (14.77% versus 8.33%; P<0.0001), heart failure (11.82% versus 10.50%; P<0.0001), and, after adjusting for traditional risk factors, significantly correlated to a composite major adverse cardiovascular events variable (odds ratio, 4.02; 95% CI, 3.88-4.16; P<0.0001), mortality (odds ratio, 1.20; CI, 1.15-1.26; P<0.0001), and higher total revenue per-year (incidence rate ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.28-1.33; P<0.0001). Conclusions EHR -based algorithms discovered a disproportionately high prevalence of FH in our medical cohort, which was associated with worse outcomes and higher costs of medical care. This data-driven approach allows for a more precise method to identify traditionally high-risk groups within large populations allowing for targeted prevention and therapeutic strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31193394>Antihyperlipidemic screening and plasma uric acid reducing potential of  seeds on Swiss albino mice model.</a></h1><p>The global prevalence of  is increasing rapidly and high dietary fat intake is a major risk factor for developing . An  biological investigation was carried out on ethanolic extract of  a plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae for the evaluation of antihyperlipidemic activity and serum uric acid reducing potential. In our study, 25 healthy male mice were selected randomly and grouped into  groups ( animals in each group). Lipid and uric acid profile were estimated after 21 days of treatment by using the enzymatic colourimetric GPO-PAP method. Results showed that ethanolic extract of  at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight showed significant (p < 0.05) cholesterol and triglyceride level reduction profile when co-administrated with 20% fat and normal feed respectively. Atorvastatin was used as standard. Data from pathological examination showed that the average weight of the heart of the mice was normal for every group when compared with control. Gr-2 (normal and extract feed) showed significant (p ˂ 0.05) increased of liver and kidney weight rather than experimental groups; however, these values were lower than the values for the control group. Uric acid level determination revealed that the ethanolic extract of  reduced serum uric acid level both in experimental groups (Gr-2 and Gr-3). Thus a considerable correlation was found between serum uric acid reducing potentials of the present plant extract with a lipid-lowering profile.

GLP-1 RAs are listed as second-line treatment in the 2017 Chinese Guideline for patients with T2DM in whom prior oral antidiabetic therapy has failed. This study compares the baseline characteristics of Chinese patients with T2DM taking different prescriptions of first injectable therapy (GLP-1-RA or insulin).The IQVIA Patient Diary Study database, which captures data from a patient medical record-based physician online survey, was the data source used in this study. Cross-sectional patient data were collected from hospitals in 15 major Chinese cities from June 1, 2016, to June 30, 2018. Adults with T2DM commencing either GLP-1-RA or insulin use as their first injectable antidiabetic therapy were included. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the GLP-1-RA and insulin treatment groups, using t tests and χ or Fisher exact tests.Overall, 563 patients using GLP-1-RAs and 2387 using insulin were identified. In general, patients using GLP-1-RA were younger (mean [SD], 49.6 [10.8] years vs 59.3 [10.9] years), had lower mean (SD) glycosylated hemoglobin levels (8.% [1.2%] vs 9.6 [1.7%]), had lower mean (SD) fasting plasma glucose levels (9.0 [1.9] mmol/L vs 10.8 [2.6] mmol/L), higher mean (SD) body mass indexes (29.4 [3.9] kg/m vs 24.6 [3.1] kg/m), had higher comorbidity of obesity (75% vs 15%), had a higher occurrence of  (63% vs 44%), and had lower occurrence of neuropathy (13% vs 34%) when compared with those using insulin (P < 0.0001 for all). The results of multivariate logistic regression model indicate that when controlling other variables in the multivariate logistic regression model, a higher fasting plasma glucose level and a longer diagnosis duration are associated with higher odds of insulin therapy commencement, but higher body mass index and some comorbidities, such as obesity and , are associated with higher odds of being a GLP-1-RA user.Significant differences were identified between selected baseline characteristics of patients initiating GLP-1-RA and insulin therapy, suggesting that these medicines are more likely to be prescribed to different types of patients with T2DM in China. These findings may help to inform Chinese physicians regarding the characteristics of those patients with T2DM who are initiating treatment with a GLP-1-RA or insulin. Because the Patient Diary Study data were collected from hospitals in 15 major cities in China, one noteworthy limitation is that the results may not represent the overall treatment pattern in rural areas of China.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The left eyes of phakic adult subjects without media opacity were analyzed. Subjective undilated manifest refraction was performed, and refractive errors were defined as myopia (spherical equivalent [SE], <-1 D), emmetropia (SE between -1 D and +1 D) and hyperopia (SE >+1 D). Retinal oximetry was performed using the Oxymap system (Oxymap Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland). Multivariate linear regression models were constructed to assess the relationship between retinal vascular oxygen saturation, SE, and AL obtained with optical biometry, with adjustments for age, sex, race, blood pressure, , and diabetes mellitus.There were 85 subjects, with mean age of 66.1 ± 11.3 years. The majority were female (60%) and Chinese (84%). A total of 60% were myopic, 28% emmetropic, and 12% hyperopic. Mean SE was -.29 ± 6.51 D and mean AL was 25.30 ± 2.99 mm. In multivariate analyses, more myopic SE and longer AL were associated with lower retinal arteriolar oxygen saturation (regression coefficient B = 0.61 [95% confidence interval, 0.28, 0.95],  = 0.001; and B = -1.13 [95% confidence interval, -1.71, -0.56],  < 0.001, respectively). Subjects with myopic SE and AL also had lower retinal arteriolar oxygen saturation than emmetropes and hyperopes ( = 0.03 and  = 0.02, respectively).Eyes with more myopic SE and longer AL have lower retinal arteriolar oxygen saturation.This study provides direct evidence of a link between retinal oxygenation and hypoxia and myopia by using a novel device that quantifies retinal vascular oxygenation in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634601>Retrograde popliteal access and balloon dilatation of chronic total occlusion of superficial femoral arteries.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of retrograde popliteal access in subjects with chronic total occlusion of the superficial femoral artery.A retrospective review of subjects who underwent balloon dilatation via PPA is included. Age, gender, tobacco use, comorbid diseases, body mass index (BMI), ejection fraction (EF), claudication distance (0 to 50 metres, 50 to 100 metres and 100 to 150 metres), preoperative Rutherford scale and Ankle-brachial index (ABI) are noted for each subject. A duplex ultrasound (DUS) was performed preoperatively. The localization side of the lesion (right-left), the length of the atherosclerotic segment (CM) and the localization of the diseased segment (proximal superficial femoral artery-SFA, mid SFA, distal SFA, popliteal-above the knee) were noted. Subjects were followed for at least one year after the procedure. Subjects were reevaluated in the 1, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. In control subjects, Rutherford class and ABI were noted. A DUS was performed to detect restenosis. The subjects' preoperative Rutherford class and ABI and restenosis degree were compared with their postoperative values.A total of 93 subjects (75.3% male, 24.7% female; mean age 68.57±8.70 years old) were evaluated. In all 93 (100%) subjects, successful RPA access was achieved. Overall, balloon dilatation via PPA was successful in 86 (92.47%) of the 93 subjects. The procedural success rate was 92.47%. The occluded segment was on the right side in 49.% of the subjects (n = 46) and on the left side in 50.% (n = 47) of the subjects. The mean length of the lesion was 10.77 ± 2.21 cm, and the average stenosis degree was 95.9 ± .05%. The localization of the occluded segment was in the proximal SFA, mid SFA, distal SFA and popliteal above the knee in 45.2%, 50.%, 25.8% and 10.8% of the patients, respectively. When comparing the successful and unsuccessful groups, target lesion length (10.48±2.01 vs 14.43±0.79, p <0.001), mid SFA localization (n=40 vs n=7, p=0,012) and claudication distance in the first 50 metres (p=0,003) were significantly higher in subjects with failed balloon dilatation via RPA. When the Rutherford scale was examined, the mild, moderate and severe claudication ratios were 23.7%, 29% and 47.3%, respectively. After the procedure, 61.3% of the cases were asymptomatic, and 38.7% had mild claudication. The change in the Rutherford scale was statistically significant (p<0,001). When the ABI measurements were examined pre-procedure, it increased from 0,63 ± 0,08 before to 0,90 ± 0,06 after the procedure, indicating a statistically significant difference (p <0,001). When Doppler findings were examined, in the successful RPA group, the no stenosis percentages were 82.6%, 72.1% and 65.1 at the 1, 6 and 12 month follow-up, respectively. The mean disease-free survival time was 9,80±0,39 months. In the first year, subjects were divided according to stenosis degree. Subjects with less than 50% stenosis were compared with subjects with more than 50% stenosis to detect the preprocedural characteristics that affect the re-stenosis degree. Tobacco use, COPD, , chronical renal insufficiency and popliteal above the knee localization were significantly higher in subjects that had more than 50% stenosis 1 year after the procedure (p=0,009, p=0,015, p=0,044, p=0,001 and p=0,017, respectively).Retrograde popliteal access(RPA) under DUS guidance is an effective method. RPA have high procedural success rate with low morbidity.

This study determined the association between and the exposure-response relationship for PM2. and the incidence of T2D in Taiwan.This retrospective cohort study was conducted for the years 2001-2012. Health information, including age, sex, health insurance premium, type of occupation, medication, and disease status, was retrieved from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. Monitoring data for PM2. came from the Environmental Protection Administration of Taiwan, and Land-use Regression modeling was used to approximate participants' long-term exposure to PM2.. Cox proportional hazards models with a generalized estimating equation to account for the correlation within the locations of the medical facilities were used to estimate the association between exposure to PM2. and the incidence of T2D, adjusting for the potential confounders. We also examined effect modification of sex, age, , and National Health Insurance premium for the association.Forty-eight thousand six hundred eleven new cases of diabetes were identified among 505,151 eligible participants, with the median follow-up of 12 years. Positive associations were identified between long-term exposure to PM2. exposure and the incidence of T2D. An increase of 10 μg/m PM2. was associated with an 11.0% increase in the risk of contracting diabetes (95% confidence interval = 8.0%, 13.0%). The results show that there is an almost linear relationship between exposure to PM2. and the incidence of T2D. Sex, age, , and National Health Insurance premium acted as effect modifiers of the association between diabetes incidence and levels of PM2. exposure in Taiwan.In the population in Taiwan, long-term exposure to PM2. increases the risk of incidence of T2D by 11%. This effect is more pronounced in elderly male patients who exhibit  and in individuals who have a lower insurance health insurance premium.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31127744>Health coaching for healthcare employees with chronic disease: A pilot study.</a></h1><p>Health coaching promotes healthy lifestyles and may be particularly helpful for employees with chronic disease.Evaluate the effects of a health coaching program that targeted health-system employees with at least one cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor.Fifty-four employees volunteered for a health coaching program (6-session, 12-week program, at least one cycle). 40 (74%) completed (mean age [SD] = 53.3 [10.3] years, Female = 95%, Caucasian = 83%). A certified and integrative health coach/nutritionist provided coaching. Self-reported outcomes were collected using a pre-post design.Participants reported high rates of obesity (75%), hypertension (52.%), diabetes/prediabetes (47.%), and  (40%). In addition, 20% reported chronic pain/rehabilitation needs, 17.% seasonal depression, and 30% other significant co-morbidities. Following coaching, participants reported significant weight loss (mean [SD] 7.2 [6.6] pounds, p < 0.0001, d = 1.11), increased exercise (from 0.8 to 2.3 sessions/week, p < 0.001, d = .89), reduced perceived stress (p < 0.04, d = .42), and a trend for improved sleep (p = 0.06, d = .38). Reduced stress correlated with both increased exercise (r = -.39, p < 0.05) and decreased fatigue (r = .36, p = 0.07).Health coaching for healthcare employees with obesity and other CVD risk factors is a promising approach to losing weight, reducing stress, making healthy lifestyle changes, and improving health and well-being.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143773>Aortic and Internal Carotid Atherosclerosis in Patients with Carotid Stenosis: Semiautomatic Volumetric Analysis of Low-Attenuation Plaque on Curved Planar Reformations Using MDCT Angiographic Data.</a></h1><p>This retrospective study included 65 patients who underwent multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) carotid angiography; 28 patients were <70 years old (group 1), and 37 were ≥70 years old (group 2). Each low-attenuation (<30 Hounsfield units [HU]) plaque volume (LPV) and total uncalcified plaque volume ([TUPV] ≤150 HU) were semiautomatically measured on each aortic arch and internal carotid artery (ICA) curved planar reformations (CPR), using MDCT angiographic data. Correlation coefficients were employed to assess the impact of each plaque volume on various factors including ICA stenosis. The correlations (r > 0.) were observed between aortic LPV and each ICA stenosis ratio and >30% stenosis in group 1, between aortic TUPV and male gender in group 1, and between ICA-TUPV and each aortic TUPV or the largest plaque thickness in group 2. Marginal correlations were observed between  and aortic LPV and ICA-TUPV in group 1. There was no association between cerebral infarction and the aortic and ICA plaques. Both the aortic arch and ICA plaque volumes can be measured clinically. The increasing aortic LPV may be a significant factor associated with the development of ICA stenosis in patients younger than 70 years old.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538122>Aortic intima-media thickness can be used to determine target organ damage in adult patients with coronary artery disease risk factors.</a></h1><p>We aimed to evaluate the relationship between abdominal aortic intima-media thickness (AA-IMT) and thoracic aortic intima-media thickness (TA-IMT) values and to investigate their relationship with common carotid intima-media thickness (CC-IMT) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors.This study included 100 patients who underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) examination for different reasons with at least one CAD risk factor. CC-IMT, AA-IMT, and TA-IMT values were measured. Patients with CC-IMT > 0.9 mm were considered as having increased CC-IMT. Patients were divided into two groups with and without increased CC-IMT.Mean AA-IMT and TA-IMT values of all patients were 1.55 ±0.27 mm and 1.39 ±0.25 mm, respectively. In patients with increased CC-IMT, blood pressure,  and hypertension frequency, creatinine, total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and uric acid levels, AA-IMT and TA-IMT values were higher, while the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level was lower than the normal CC-IMT group. AA-IMT, systolic blood pressure (SBP), total and HDL cholesterol levels independently determined the patients with CC-IMT > 0.9 mm. Each 0.1 mm increase in AA-IMT value was found to increase the probability of having CC-IMT > 0.9 mm. In addition, linear regression analysis showed that CC-IMT was closely and independently related to AA-IMT ( < 0.001 and β = 0.599). When the cut-off value for AA-IMT was taken as 1. mm, it determined the patients with CC-IMT > 0.9 mm with 86% sensitivity and 82% specificity.The AA-IMT value was found to be higher than TA-IMT in the same patient. Also it was found that AA-IMT was more closely related to CC-IMT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460822>Prevalence and natural history of and risk factors for subaneurysmal aorta among 65-year-old men.</a></h1><p> The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of screening-detected subaneurysmal aorta (SAA), i.e. an aortic diameter of 2.-2.9 cm, its associated risk factors, and natural history among 65-year-old men.  A total of 14,620 men had their abdominal aortas screened with ultrasound and completed a health questionnaire containing information on smoking habits and medical history. They were categorized based on the aortic diameter: normal aorta (<2. cm;  = 14,129), SAA (2.-2.9 cm;  = 258), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (≥3.0 cm;  = 233). The SAA-group was rescanned after  years. Associated risk factors were analyzed.  The SAA-prevalence was 1.9% (95% confidence interval 1.7%-2.1%), with 57.0% (50.7%-63.3%) expanding to ≥3.0 cm within  years. Frequency of smoking, coronary artery disease, hypertension, , and claudication were significantly higher in those with SAA and AAA compared to those with normal aortic diameter. Current smoking was the strongest risk factor for SAA (odds ratio [OR] 2.8;  < 0.001) and even stronger for AAA (OR 3.6;  < 0.001). Men with SAA expanding to AAA within  years presented pronounced similarities to AAA at baseline.  Men with SAA and AAA presented marked similarities in the risk factor profile. Smoking was the strongest risk factor with an incremental association with disease severity, and disease progression. This indicates that SAA and AAA may have the same pathophysiological origin and that SAA should be considered as an early stage of aneurysm formation. Further research on the cost-effectiveness and potential benefits of surveillance as well as smoking cessation and secondary cardiovascular prevention in this subgroup is warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195876>Coronary Artery Disease in Adults With Coarctation of Aorta: Incidence, Risk Factors, and Outcomes.</a></h1><p>Background Premature coronary artery disease ( CAD ) is common in patients with coarctation of aorta ( COA ), but there are limited data about any direct relationship (or lack thereof) between COA and CAD . We hypothesized that atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, rather than COA diagnosis, was the primary determinant of CAD occurrence in patients with COA . Methods and Results This is a retrospective study of 654 COA patients and a control group of 876 patients with valvular pulmonic stenosis and tetralogy of Fallot to determine prevalence and independent risk factors for CAD . There was no evidence of a difference in the unadjusted CAD prevalence between the COA and control groups (7.8% versus 6.3%, P=0.247), but premature CAD was more common in COA patients (4.4% versus 1.8%, P=0.002). In the analysis of a propensity-matched cohort of 126 COA and 126 control patients, there was no evidence of a difference in overall CAD prevalence (6.3% versus .6% versus P=0.742) and premature CAD prevalence (4.8% versus 3.2%, P=0.518). The multivariable risk factors for CAD were hypertension (odds ratio [ OR ] 2.14; 95% CI 1.36-3.38),  ( OR 3.33; 95% CI 2.02-.47), diabetes mellitus ( OR 1.98; 95% CI 1.31-3.61), male sex ( OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.33-3.17), and older age per year ( OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.04-1.07). Conclusions After adjusting for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, we did not find evidence of a difference in CAD risk between the patients with COA and other patients with congenital heart disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31238621>[A follow-up study on the clinical characteristics among patients with diabetes mellitus combined with acute myocardial infarction].</a></h1><p> To investigate the clinical characteristics of diabetic patients combined with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to compare the prognosis between diabetic and non- diabetic patients in 4- years after the onset of AMI.  Followed the certain inclusive and exclusive criteria, a total of 420 patients with acute myocardial infarction were included and divided into diabetes group (group D) and non-diabetes group (group N) with numbers as 161 people and 259 respectively. Baseline data, clinical information, short-term outcome and long-term prognosis of the two groups were compared and analyzed.  Among the patients with diabetes, the average age was older (65.65±11.33 . 63.30±15.34), with fewer males (64.59. 79.92%); and more likely to have other complications as hypertension (64.60. 53.28%) or  (42.24. 26.25%). 59.29% of the patients in group D showed pathological changes in 3 major coronary arteries, which were significantly more than its counterpart (40.83%). The proportion of patients that had undergone the coronary artery bypass, grafting (11.11. .31%) appeared also higher. There was no significant difference seen in the short-term outcomes between the two groups, but results from the long-term follow-up program showed that both the incidence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) (50.67 27.72%) and the all-cause mortality (20.00. 9.90%) in group D were higher than those appeared in group N (27.72%).  Patients suffered from the combination of both diabetes and acute myocardial infarction appeared older in age, more in females, with more complications and the coronary artery lesions were more severe and wider. During hospitalization, no significant difference was seen regarding the short-term outcomes between the two groups but the results from long-term follow-up process showing that the risk of MACE events was significantly higher in patients with type2 diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273595>Survey of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Knowledge, Nutrition, and Physical Activity Patterns Among the General Public in Beijing, China.</a></h1><p>Despite high prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in China, understanding of the disease appears to be low.We assessed the knowledge of NAFLD among the public in Beijing, China, as well as diet and physical activity patterns, which may provide information useful for NAFLD prevention and management.We surveyed adult patients and family members in the Peking University Health Science Center (PUHSC) ultrasound clinic and office staff in Beijing, China. Participants provided demographic and medical history data. NAFLD-related knowledge and diet and physical activity were assessed.A total of 1296 participants at the PUHSC clinic (51% female, median age 35, 61% college-educated) and 494 participants in offices (61% female, median age 43, 74% college-educated) completed the survey. Response rate was 68.4% and 96.7%, respectively. In clinic and offices, 44% versus 48% were overweight/obese, % had a history of diabetes in both groups, and 14% versus 23% had a personal history of NAFLD. Median knowledge score was 15 out of 25 in clinic versus 16 in offices. 44.9% reported minimal physical activity.

However, CKD is not recognized as an ASCVD risk equivalent by most lipid guidelines. Statin medications, especially when combined with ezetimibe, significantly reduce ASCVD risk in patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD. Unless physicians recognize the heightened ASCVD risk in this population, statins may not be prescribed in the absence of clinical cardiovascular disease or diabetes, a recognized ASCVD risk equivalent. We examined statin use in adults with nondialysis-dependent CKD and examined whether the use differed in the presence of clinical ASCVD and diabetes.This study ascertained statin use from pharmacy dispensing records during fiscal years 2012 and 2013 from the US Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. The study included 581 344 veterans aged ≥50 years with nondialysis-dependent CKD Stages 3- with no history of kidney transplantation or dialysis. The 10-year predicted ASCVD risk was calculated with the pooled risk equation.Of veterans with CKD, 62.1% used statins in 2012 and 55.4% used statins continuously over 2 years (2012-13). Statin use in 2012 was 76.2 and 75.% among veterans with CKD and ASCVD or diabetes, respectively, but in the absence of ASCVD, diabetes or a diagnosis of , statin use was 21.8% (P < 0.001). The 10-year predicted ASCVD risk was ≥7.% in 95.1% of veterans with CKD, regardless of diabetes status.Statin use is low in veterans with nondialysis-dependent CKD in the absence of ASCVD or diabetes despite high-predicted ASCVD risk.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia among adults, in relation to economic status.A cross-sectional study using stratified random sampling was conducted in seven coastal villages in Semporna, Sabah: Kabogan Laut, Salimbangun, Pekalangan, Pokas, Tampi-Tampi Timbayan, Sum Sum and Selinggit. Socio-demographic data were obtained via interviewer administered questionnaires in Sabah Malay creole. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and blood lipids were obtained.A total of 330 adults (133 males, 197 females) completed the study. Mean age was 43.7 ± 15.8 years. Most participants (87%) were living below the Poverty Line Income. Median per capita household income was RM83.33/month (≈ USD20/month). The number of newly diagnosed cases of hypercholesterolemia was 40.6%, diabetes mellitus was .8%, and hypertension was 24.%. Adults from the hardcore poor economic status (household income ≤RM760/month (≈USD183/month) were the most represented in those who did not have a blood pressure, blood sugar and blood lipids check in the 12 months preceding the study (Χ, p < 0.01). Adults from hardcore poor economic status were also the most represented in undiagnosed hypertension and uncontrolled blood pressure among those diagnosed (Χ, p = 0.013). Among diabetics from the hardcore poor group, the undiagnosed fasting blood glucose was 11.2 ± 4. compared to .1 ± 0.6 mmol/L for diagnosed diabetics (p < 0.001). Among hypercholesterolemics from the hardcore poor group, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol values were significantly higher in the undiagnosed group compared to the diagnosed group (p < 0.001).Many people in this rural coastal community were unaware that they had high cholesterol level (40.6%) and elevated blood pressure (24.%).

Whether this phenomenon is independent of statin use is unknown. We investigated the association between low TC levels and long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a prospective study of men aged ≥70 years without ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and whether this was influenced by statin use.The CHAMP (Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project) cohort is a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling men aged ≥70 years. The relationship between TC and long-term MACE was analysed using Cox-regression modelling adjusted for comorbidities and stratified by statin use.The study cohort comprised 1289 men (mean (±SD) age, 77.0±. years; mean follow-up, 6.4±2.7 years). Decreasing TC level was associated with increased comorbidity burden, frailty and MACE (linear trend p<0.001). In men not on statin therapy (n=731), each 1 mmol/L decrease in TC was associated with increased MACE (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.45, p=0.001) and mortality (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.44, p=0.02) adjusted for comorbidities. In contrast, low TC in men on statins (n=558) was not associated with MACE (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.11) or mortality (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09).Low TC is associated with increased risk of MACE in older men without IHD who are not taking statin therapy but not in those on statins.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The femoral arteries were divided into common femoral artery (CFA), proximal of superficial femoral artery (pSFA), adductor canal (AC), and popliteal artery (PA) segments. The characteristics of femoral artery atherosclerotic plaques were compared between patients with and without DM.Forty-eight patients with DM (69. ± 8.2 years; 26 males) and 50 patients without DM (71.9 ± .7 years; 28 males) were included. Significant differences were found in maximum wall thickness in CFA and AC segments, eccentricity index in AC segment, prevalence of plaque in CFA, pSFA and AC segments, stenosis and prevalence of calcification in pSFA, AC and PA segments, prevalence of lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC) in all segments, and prevalence of intraplaque haemorrhage in PA segment between patients with and without DM (all P < .05). After adjusted for confounding factors of age, gender, , coronary artery disease, and statin use, the differences in eccentricity index, stenosis and prevalence of plaque, calcification and LRNC in pSFA and AC segments, and stenosis and prevalence of LRNC in PA segment remained statistically significant between patients with and without DM (all P < .05).Patients with DM have significantly larger plaque burden, higher prevalence of plaques, and more complex plaque compositions in femoral arteries than those without DM.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234608>Effect of Acute Ingestion of Green Tea Extract and Lemon Juice on Oxidative Stress and Lipid Profile in Pigs Fed a High-Fat Diet.</a></h1><p>Green tea and its catechins have been shown to ameliorate high fat diet-induced oxidative stress and . However, low bioavailability of catechins limits their therapeutic potential. Lemon juice (LJ) has been suggested to enhance the bioavailability of catechins in vitro. This study investigated the antioxidative and hypolipidemic efficacy of a single dose of green tea extract (GTE) or GTE plus LJ (GTE + LJ) in high-fat diet fed pigs. Sixteen pigs ingested a single dose of GTE (190 mg/kg/day) or GTE + LJ (0.75 mL/kg/day) mixed with low-fat (LF; % fat) or high-fat (HF; 22% fat) diets and blood samples were collected for 24 h. Plasma catechin level peaked at two hours, and gradually returned to baseline after six hours following the intake. The addition of LJ significantly increased plasma catechin level. The diet containing GTE did not lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity, or malondialdehyde concentration in 24 h in HF-fed pigs. Addition of a single dose of LJ, however, significantly decreased plasma TG level in LF groups but did not cause further changes on any other markers compared to the GTE alone. Our findings indicate limited effect of a single meal containing GTE on plasma antioxidant enzymes, lipid profile, and lipid peroxidation in pigs and no significant synergistic/additive action of adding LJ to GTE within 24 h in pigs. A study with a longer treatment period is warranted to further understand the potential role of GTE in reducing HF diet-induced oxidative stress and the possible synergistic role of LJ.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262499>GC-MS based metabolomics strategy to distinguish three types of acute pancreatitis.</a></h1><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a progressive systemic inflammatory response with high morbidity and high mortality, which is mainly caused by alcohol, bulimia, gallstones and . The early diagnosis of different types of AP and further explore potential pathophysiological mechanism of each type of AP is beneficial for optimized treatment strategies and better patient's care. In this study, a metabolomics approach based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and random forests algorithm was established to distinguish biliary acute pancreatitis (BAP),  acute pancreatitis (HLAP), and alcoholic acute pancreatitis (AAP), from healthy controls. The classification accuracies for BAP, HLAP, and AAP patients compared with healthy control, were 0.886, 0.906 and 0.857, respectively, by using -fold cross-validation method. And some special metabolites for each type of AP were discovered, such as l-Lactic acid, (R)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid, Phosphoric acid, Glycine, Erythronic acid, l-Phenylalanine, d-Galactose, l-Tyrosine, Arachidonic acid, Glycerol 1-hexadecanoate. Furthermore, associations between these metabolites with the metabolism of amino acids, fatty acids were identified. Our studies have illuminated the biomarkers and physiological mechanism of disease in a clinical setting, which suggested that metabolomics is a valuable tool for identifying the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the etiology of BAP, AAP, HLAP and thus novel therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2019.

Participants were free of clinical CVD at baseline. Statistical analysis was performed from June 1, 2017, to May 31, 2018.The prevalence of CAC and the subsequent rates of CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality. Competing risks regression modeling was used to calculate multivariable-adjusted subdistribution hazard ratios for CHD and CVD mortality.The sample of 22 346 participants (25.0% women and 75.0% men; mean [SD] age, 43. [4.] years) had a high prevalence of  (49.6%) and family history of CHD (49.3%) but a low prevalence of current smoking (11.0%) and diabetes (3.9%). The prevalence of any CAC was 34.4%, with 7.2% having a CAC score of more than 100. During follow-up (mean [SD], 12.7 [4.0] years), there were 40 deaths related to CHD, 84 deaths related to CVD, and 298 total deaths. A total of 27 deaths related to CHD (67.%) occurred among individuals with CAC at baseline. The CHD mortality rate per 1000 person-years was 10-fold higher among those with a CAC score of more than 100 (0.69; 95% CI, 0.41-1.16) compared with those with a CAC score of 0 (0.07; 95% CI, 0.04-0.12). After multivariable adjustment, those with a CAC score of more than 100 had a significantly increased risk of CHD (subdistribution hazard ratio, .6; 95% CI, 2.-12.7), CVD (subdistribution hazard ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.8-6.2), and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.9-3.6) compared with those with a CAC score of 0.In a large sample of young adults undergoing CAC testing for clinical indications, 34.4% had CAC, and those with elevated CAC scores had significantly higher rates of CHD and CVD mortality.

We established both cohorts from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2011 to observe the incidence of fracture. The occurrence of fracture was followed-up until the end of 2011.The primary measure was incidence of fracture. The relative risk of fracture was estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for age, sex, index year and comorbidities. Comorbidities included diabetes mellitus, , stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, alcohol-related illness, osteoporosis, end-stage renal disease, obesity and rheumatoid arthritis, using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification.Patients with OUD were 4.13 times more likely to suffer fractures than patients without OUD [incidence rate (IR) per 1000 person-years = 23.0 versus .47, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 3.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.27-4.29]. Compared with the control group, the risk of fracture was higher among the patients with OUD. Risk of fracture was higher in male elderly patients with diabetes mellitus, alcohol-related illness or osteoporosis. The cumulative incidences of fracture over 14 years of patients with OUD and without OUD differed significantly.Taiwanese patients with opioid use disorder appear to have a higher adjusted hazard ratio for fracture than Taiwanese patients without opioid use disorder.© 2019 Society for the Study of Addiction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31352663>The Effects of a New Generation of Nutraceutical Compounds on Lipid Profile and Glycaemia in Subjects with Pre-hypertension.</a></h1><p>Treatment strategies for patients with pre-hypertension and low-moderate cardiovascular (CV) risk may include nutraceutical compounds (NCs).To investigate the efficacy and safety of a new-generation of NC in lowering BP values and improving metabolic profile, in a group of hyper-cholesterolemic subjects with pre-hypertension.131 subjects with pre-hypertension (systolic BP 130-139 mmHg and/or diastolic BP 85-89 mmHg) without organ damage and history of CV diseases were enrolled. 66 subjects were treated with a once-daily oral formulation of a NC (red yeast rice, Berberine, Coenzyme Q10, folic acid and chrome) added to diet for 3 months, while 65 patients followed a diet only. Differences in serum total cholesterol (TC), low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC and HDLC), triglycerides (TG), glycemia, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated.At the end of treatment, significant reductions of TC, LDLC, TG glucose levels were observed in both treatment groups, while HDLC values increased in the active treatment group only. A greater reduction of TC, LDLC and glycemia was observed in the treatment group. TG levels were not different within the two groups.

Progressive cases may result in lethal outcomes and have proven difficult to treat. Sirolimus is showing promising results in the management of vascular anomalies. We examined the efficacy and safety of sirolimus treatment in patients with progressive LAs.All patients with LAs treated with sirolimus from May 2015 to September 2018 were included. They received oral sirolimus once a day and the dose was adjusted so that the trough concentration remained within -15 ng/mL. We prospectively reviewed the response to drugs (the response rate of radiological volumetric change of the target lesion), severity scores, reported quality of life (QOL), and adverse effects at 6 months after administration.Twenty patients (five with cystic lymphatic malformation (LM), three with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis, three with generalized lymphatic anomaly, six with Gorham-Stout disease, and three with central conducting lymphatic anomaly) were treated with sirolimus at our institution. Fifty percent of patients (10/20) demonstrated a partial response by a radiological examination and a significant improvement in disease severity and QOL scores (P = 0.0020 and P = 0.0117, respectively).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the association of survival with variables that could be utilized to improve clinical decisions. A total of 1194 dogs with a gross and histopathological diagnosis of GBM were included from 41 veterinary referral hospitals in this retrospective study. Dogs with GBM that demonstrated abnormal clinical signs had significantly greater odds of death than subclinical dogs in a univariable analysis (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.14-8.23; P<0.001). The multivariable model indicated that categorical variables including owner recognition of jaundice (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.19-3.77; P=0.011), concurrent hyperadrenocorticism (OR 1.94; 95% CI, 1.08-3.47; P=0.026), and Pomeranian breed (OR, 2.46; 95% CI 1.10-.50; P=0.029) were associated with increased odds of death, and vomiting was associated with decreased odds of death (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.72; P=0.001). Continuous variables in the multivariable model, total serum/plasma bilirubin concentration (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; P<0.001) and age (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.26; P<0.001), were associated with increased odds of death. The clinical utility of total serum/plasma bilirubin concentration as a biomarker to predict death was poor with a sensitivity of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.54-0.69) and a specificity of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.59-0.66). This study identified several prognostic variables in dogs with GBM including total serum/plasma bilirubin concentration, age, clinical signs, concurrent hyperadrenocorticism, and the Pomeranian breed.

Statins are the first-line lipid-lowering drugs for this combined . However, it remains undetermined whether reduction of remnant lipoprotein mediates the relationship between improvement in endothelial dysfunction and reduction of LDL-C level after statin treatment.A total of 122 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with impaired flow-mediated dilation (FMD; <.%), high levels of LDL-C (≥100 mg/dL), and remnant-like lipoprotein particle cholesterol (RLP-C) (≥ mg/dL) were examined in this study. The lipid profiles and FMD were measured before and after 6-9 months of statin treatment. The association between changes in LDL-C levels and its relationship with changes in FMD was investigated. Furthermore, mediation analysis was performed to assess the changes in RLP-C level as a mediator of the relationship between the reduction in LDL-C level and improvement of FMD.Treatment with statins improved FMD in 69 (56.%) patients. Patients with improved FMD showed lower percent changes of LDL-C, triglyceride (TG), RLP-C, RLP-C/TG, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and higher percent change of HDL-C level, compared to patients who did not show improved FMD. The percent changes in FMD levels had a significant inverse correlation with the percent changes in LDL-C, (r = -0.18, p =  0.03), RLP-C (r = -0.39, p < 0.001), RLP-C/TG (r = -0.34, p < 0.001), and CRP (r = -0.27, p < 0.01). Mediation analysis showed that the relationship between reduction in LDL-C and improvement of FMD was mediated by reduction of RLP-C (34.%), RLP-C/TG (24.4%), and CRP (24.9%) levels.Improvement of remnant lipoproteinemia may be an important mediator for the relationship between improvement of endothelial dysfunction and LDL-lowering after statin treatment in patients with CAD.Copyright © 2019.

Subjects with  (n=22) and age-matched healthy controls (n=19) were included in this study. Results showed that plasma levels of Gla-Gas6 protein and VK were significantly lower in hyperlipidemic subjects compared to control. Moreover, Gla-Gas6 levels were significantly and positively correlated with VK (P=.034, r=0.452) and negatively with triglyceride (P=.022, r=-0.485) and total cholesterol (P=.043, r=-0.435) in hyperlipidemic subjects, which suggest that VK supplementation may have a positive effect in activating Gas6 protein and thereby reducing the aberrant plasma lipid levels. Further studies with high-fat diet (HFD)-fed animal model of  demonstrated that VK supplementation ( μg/kg body weight, 8 weeks) reduced the plasma lipid levels, stimulated both the plasma levels and the hepatic protein expression of Gla-Gas6 protein, and regulated the AMPK/SREBP1/PPARα signaling pathways of hepatic lipid metabolism in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, by using palmitic acid (PA, 0.75 mM)-treated both control and GGCX knockdown hepatocytes, this study dissected the direct role of Gla-Gas6 in mediating the positive effect of VK on preventing the PA-induced impaired hepatic lipid metabolism via regulating AMPK/SREBP1/PPARα pathways. Combining all, the present study demonstrated the beneficial effect of VK supplementation in preventing the impaired lipid homeostasis via activating VK-dependent Gas6 protein.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to investigate the antiobesity and hypolipidemic effects of hydroxy--sanshool (HAS) isolated from  on hyperlipidemic rats. Wistar rats ( = 48) were randomly divided into six groups: (1) normal diet rats (ND), (2) high-fat diet- (HFD-) treated rats, (3) HFD+fenofibrate-treated rats (HFD+FNB), (4) HFD+low dose of HAS-treated rats (HFD+LD, 9 mg/kg), () HFD+middle dose of HAS-treated rats (HFD+MD, 18 mg/kg), and (6) HFD+high dose of HAS-treated rats (HFD+HD, 36 mg/kg). The body weight and food intake of the rats were recorded during the treatment period. After 4 weeks of HAS treatment, abdominal adipose tissues were observed and total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) of serum and liver tissues were determined. Furthermore, histochemical examinations using oil red O and hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E) were carried out and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver were determined. After HFD feeding, the body weight gain and food efficiency ratio of HFD rats were significantly enhanced ( < 0.05 ND rats) and HAS treatment (18 and 36 mg/kg) significantly decreased the body weight gain and food efficiency ratio ( < 0.05 HFD rats). In addition, HAS treatment could decrease the abdominal adipose tissues and liver adipocytes. Furthermore, HAS treatment significantly decreased the T-CHO, TG, and LDL-C, whereas it increased HDL-C ( < 0.05 HFD rats) in serum and the liver. HAS treatment increased the GSH level and SOD activity in the liver ( < 0.05 HFD rats), whereas it decreased the levels of MDA ( < 0.05 HFD rats). mRNA analyses suggested that HAS treatment increases the expression of  (proliferator-activated receptor ) and  (peroxisome apolipoprotein E). Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting indicated that HAS stimulation increased the levels of PPAR and APOE in the liver, as a stress response of the body defense system. These results revealed that HAS exerts antiobesity and hypolipidemic activities in HFD rats by reducing liver oxidative stress and thus could be considered as a potential candidate drug to cure or prevent obesity and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31249691>Database analysis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and treatment flow in early and advanced stages.</a></h1><p>Despite recent developments in treatment modalities and diagnosis, the prognosis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unsatisfactory. To gain insight into treatment decisions for HCC patients, their characteristics and treatment flow in the early and advanced stages were examined. HCC patients' characteristics and treatment flow were retrospectively analyzed using the Japanese medical claims database. The 8999 patients' mean age at HCC diagnosis was 71.1 years, with no difference between early (Stage I/II) and advanced (Stage III/IV) stages. The mean observation period was 26.2 months, shorter in advanced than in early stages. HCV hepatitis was reported in 52.0% of HCC patients, with concomitant hypertension in 53.4%, type 2 diabetes in 45.8%, cirrhosis in 39.3%, and  in 15.%. The rates of HCV hepatitis, hypertension, and  decreased with stage progression. Analysis of treatment flow showed that, at all disease stages, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was the most common first to fourth-line treatment. Epirubicin was the most frequently (44.1%) used chemotherapeutic agent for first-line TACE, followed by miriplatin (23.6%) and cisplatin (12.3%). With stage progression, cisplatin use increased. Sorafenib was used concomitantly for first-line TACE in 3.2% of patients, and its use increased significantly in advanced stages.

The volunteers from the first group were requested to ingest 100 g of regular DC whereas the individuals from the third group were given 100 g of highly bioavailable lycosome formulated L-tug formulation of DC containing 23.3 mg of lycopene. A second group received a 23.3 mg lycopene capsule, a tomato-derived antioxidant carotenoid as a matching control. Serum specimens were obtained following 30 minutes as well as 1, 2, and 3 hours after study products intake. Ingestion of L-tug DC was accompanied by the reduced postprandial hyperglycemia with maximum difference seen at 3 hour of the study and reduction of average AUC values by 20% (P<0.05) as compared to regular DC. Moreover, ingestion of L-tug DC was accompanied by a statistically significantly reduced median concentration for postprandial triglycerides (to 390.7 mg⁎hr/dL; /95%% CIs: 363.2/405.7 versus regular DC value of 439.5mg⁎hr/dL and a lower range of confidence intervals - /95%CIs: 394.0/475.1). A similar tendency was observed in changes of total cholesterol concentration. Ingestion of L-tug DC completely abolished total cholesterol increase seen in volunteers at 3 hour of postprandial period following intake of the control DC. Ingestion of lycopene alone did not cause any changes in postprandial changes of glucose or serum lipids. The observed postprandial changes can be related to the 56.2 % increase in serum lycopene level which was observed after ingestion of L-tug DC only. Higher serum lycopene levels following the ingestion of L-tug DC resulted in a corresponding increase in serum antioxidant capacity and reduction of oxidized LDL as well as a decline in malonic dialdehyde concentration in the serum of volunteers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260567> prevalence and cholesterol control in obstructive sleep apnoea: Data from the European sleep apnea database (ESADA).</a></h1><p>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and  are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Corresponding numbers in patients with diabetes were 8.% and 41.%, P < 0.001. Compared with ODI quartile I, patients in ODI quartiles II-IV had an adjusted OR (95% CI) of 1.33 (1.15-1.55), 1.37 (1.17-1.61) and 1.33 (1.12-1.58) (P < 0.001), respectively, for . Obesity was defined as a significant risk factor for . Subgroups of OSA patients with cardio-metabolic comorbidities demonstrated higher prevalence of HL. In addition, differences in  prevalence were reported in European geographical regions with the highest prevalence in Central Europe.Obstructive sleep apnoea, in particular intermittent hypoxia, was independently associated with the prevalence of  diagnosis.© 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594440>Verruciform Xanthoma of the Esophagus: Two Case Reports With Review of the Literature.</a></h1><p>Verruciform xanthoma is a rare benign verrucopapillary lesion that develops in the oral mucosa and genital skin. Its development in the esophagus is extremely rare, with only  reported cases. We present 2 cases of verruciform xanthoma of the esophagus. Case 1 involved a 91-year-old woman, who had hypertension and chronic gastritis with  infection, with a 12-year history of a 10-mm white-yellow elevated lesion on the esophagus, 35 cm from the incisor teeth. Case 2 involved a 70-year-old man with fundic gland polyp, , and lung cancer, who had a 10-mm whitish granular/verrucoid lesion on the esophagus, 28 cm from the incisor teeth. Microscopically, these lesions show verrucous and papillomatous epithelial hyperplasia with neutrophilic intraepithelial exocytosis. The histological hallmark is the presence of numerous foamy histiocytes infiltrating the elongated squamous epithelial papillae. Although its etiology is unknown, irritation or trauma caused by radiotherapy has been suggested.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175138>Future risk of cardiovascular disease risk factors and events in women after a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy.</a></h1><p>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), such as gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, affect up to 10% of all pregnancies. These women have on average a twofold higher risk to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life as compared with women with normotensive pregnancies. This increased risk might result from an underlying predisposition to CVD, HDP itself or a combination of both. After pregnancy women with HDP show an increased risk of classical cardiovascular risk factors including chronic hypertension, renal dysfunction, dyslipidemia, diabetes and subclinical atherosclerosis. The prevalence and onset of cardiovascular risk factors depends on the severity of the HDP and the coexistence of other pregnancy complications. At present, guidelines addressing postpartum cardiovascular risk assessment for women with HDP show a wide variation in their recommendations. This makes cardiovascular follow-up of women with a previous HDP confusing and non-coherent. Some guidelines advise to initiate cardiovascular follow-up (blood pressure, weight and lifestyle assessment) 6-8 weeks after pregnancy, whereas others recommend to start 6-12 months after pregnancy. Concurrent blood pressure monitoring, lipid and glucose assessment is recommended to be repeated annually to every  years until the age of 50 years when women will qualify for cardiovascular risk assessment according to all international cardiovascular prevention guidelines.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The occurrence of AMI in AF patients may lead to dismal prognosis. Risk assessment is a fundamental component of prevention for AMI.2419 consecutive patients with nonvalvular AF were enrolled in this retrospective study. A logistic regression analysis was performed on clinical variables to create a simple clinical prediction rule. The following nine variables and assigned scores (in brackets) were included in the prediction rule: age ≥65 years (1.0), heart failure (1.0), hypertension (1.0), diabetes mellitus (1.0),  (0.), history of stroke/TIA (0.), vascular disease (1.0), current smoking (0.), and resting heart rate >90 beats/min (1.0). Patients were considered to have a low probability if the score was ≤2., moderate if the score was 3.0 to 4.0, and high if the score was ≥4.. The AMI unlikely was assigned to patients with scores <3. and AMI likely if the score was ≥3.. To evaluate the score, we included an external validation cohort of 1810 nonvalvular AF patients from the Cardiology Center, Shandong Provincial Hospital affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, China.The score showed a good ability in discriminating AF patients experiencing AMI both in the internal derivation cohort, with a c-index of 0.80 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.77-0.83, p<0.001] and in the external validation cohort (c-index 0.73, 95% CI 0.69-0.77, p<0.001). Our scoring system offered significantly better predictive performance than the CHA2DS2-VASc score (c-index 0.80 vs 0.71, p<0.001).Our scoring system is a simple and accurate way of predicting the risk of AMI in AF patients. Therefore, more accurate targeting of preventive therapy will be allowed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171564>Risk Factors for Atrial Fibrillation in People With Type 1 Diabetes: An Observational Cohort Study of 36,258 Patients From the Swedish National Diabetes Registry.</a></h1><p>This study identified variables associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation in people with type 1 diabetes.We performed a cohort study of people with type 1 diabetes from the Swedish National Diabetes Registry followed up between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2013. Median follow-up was 9.7 years (interquartile range .2-13.0). The association between potential risk factors and incident atrial fibrillation was investigated using adjusted Cox regression. To compare the impact of each risk factor, the gradient of risk per 1 SD was estimated.In this cohort of 36,258 patients with type 1 diabetes, 749 developed atrial fibrillation during follow-up. Older age, male sex, renal complications, increased BMI and HbA, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and heart valve disease increased the risk of atrial fibrillation. Age, signs of renal dysfunction with macroalbuminuria, and decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rate were associated with the highest gradient of risk for atrial fibrillation. High blood pressure, severe obesity (BMI >35 kg/m), and elevated levels of HbA (>9.6%) were associated with increased risk, but no associations were found with  or smoking.The most prominent risk factors for atrial fibrillation in people with type 1 diabetes were older age, cardiovascular comorbidities, and renal complications, while obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia had more modest affects.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258358>The Novel CHADS-VASC-FSH Score is Predictive of Severe Coronary Artery Disease on Coronary Angiography in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Unstable Symptoms.</a></h1><p>AF may create confusion about the presence of severe or unstable coronary artery disease in cases with unstable symptoms.

The surgeon had 20 years of experience in this field and he had performed over 5000 major laparoscopic bariatric procedures before starting this new bariatric program. The concept of enhanced recovery after bariatric surgery (ERABS) was applied from the beginning of the program. We decided to analyze the first 2 years of ERAS activity after having split them in two different periods: the 1st year of activity included restrictive procedures and the 2nd year associated malabsorptive surgeries.  The results of the use of a fast-track program could be measured by different parameters like operative time, length of hospital stay, rate of complications, and rate of readmission and reoperation.  Between January and December 2015, 116 patients underwent a bariatric procedure. The mean age was 34.6 years (16-61) and average body mass index (BMI) was 41.7 kg/sqm (32-72.2). Sixty percent of patients were women and 37% of patients had at least one comorbidity (diabetes type 2, high blood pressure, , or sleep apnea). Ninety-four percent of the procedures were laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), 2.6% were laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 3.4% band removal. The mean operative time was 20 minutes for an LSG (14-45 minutes) and the average hospital stay was 1.2 days (standard deviation [SD]: 0.9-3.3). The rate of complications was 1.7% with 1 postoperative hematoma drained by CT scan on day 14 after the surgery and 1 relative stenosis endoscopically dilated on postoperative day 45. No reoperation was done. No leak was observed. At 1 year, the mean excess weight loss (EWL) was 64% (47-124) in 89 patients with a 76% rate of follow-up. For the 2nd year of activity in 2016, 142 patients went in the program. The mean age was 32.7 years (17-64) and average BMI was 42.3 kg/sqm (31-68). Seventy-two percent were women and 41% of the patients had one comorbidity or more. The majority of surgeries performed were LSG for 83.1% of the patients. RYGB was realized in 4.2% of cases, resleeve gastrectomy in 4.2%, and band removal in 1.4%. Some malabsorptive surgeries were performed as well, such as one anastomosis gastric bypass for 3 patients (4.2%), and single anastomosis duodeno-ilelal in 2 cases (2.8%). The average hospital stay was 1. days (SD: 0.9-3.). No complication was observed. No reoperation was done. Two patients (1.4%) came back to the hospital on postoperative day 2 and 8 after a LSG for one or several episodes of vomiting without further complication. At 1 year, the mean EWL was 68% (49-154) in 98 patients with a 69% rate of follow-up.  This new program of bariatric surgery in two steps using fast-track protocols, respecting international guidelines and with an experienced surgeon showed on its 1st year of implementation a 1.7% rate of readmission on 116 patients without reoperation or major complication and a hospital stay of 1.2 days. For the 2nd year of implementation with the inclusion of malabsorptive procedures only 2 patients (1.4%) were readmitted for a short episode of vomiting and the hospital stay was 1. days.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139524>Lipid Profile of Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).</a></h1><p>Introduction  Irrespective of underlying , the serum lipid profile witnesses a phasic fluctuation immediately after a major cardiovascular event. This study aims to evaluate the change in serum lipid profile in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods It was a prospective, cross-sectional study conducted in the department of cardiology, Shalamar Hospital, and Punjab Institute of Cardiology, from October until December 2018, focusing on patients admitted with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient's demographics and lipid profile (in mg/dl) within the first 24 hours and after 48 hours of the event were recorded. Results The mean serum total cholesterol (TC) levels decreased from 207. ± 30. to 192.4 ± 49.3 after 48 hours (p-value <0.0001). Mean serum triglyceride (TGs) levels increased from 153.8 ± 10.2 to 183.8 ± 14.8 (p-value <0.0001). Mean serum low density lipid-cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased from 149.0 ± 41.2 to 133.4 ± 54.0 (p-value = 0.0003). Mean serum high density lipid-cholesterol (HDL-C) decreased from 46.6 ± 9.9 to 40.7 ± 11.8 (p-value <0.0001). Conclusion Phasic fluctuations in serum lipid profile are observed after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The trend that follows include reduced TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C, and increased TGs. Periodic lipid profile must be evaluated in all patients admitted for AMI to understand the changing trend, initiate lifestyle measures to reach target lipid levels, and predict the choice of lipid-lowering therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201956> induces meibomian gland dysfunction.</a></h1><p>To investigate the pathological changes of the meibomian gland (MG) and ocular surface in Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE) mice and to investigate the association of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) with .Total plasma cholesterol was measured in different ages of ApoE and wild type (WT) mice, whilst the ocular surfaces were observed by slit-lamp biomicroscopy. MG sections were subjected to H&E staining, Oil Red O staining, TUNEL assay and immunostaining. Quantitate RT-PCR and Western blot analyses were performed to detect the relative gene expression in MGs. The -month-old ApoE mice were administered with rosiglitazone or GW9662 + rosiglitazone via oral gavage for 2 months to determine their effect on MG pathological change.We found eyelid abnormality, MG dropout, abnormal MG acinar morphology, dilated MG duct and plugging of the MG orifice in ApoE mice. MG acini in ApoE mice showed exaggerated lipid accumulation. Abnormal keratinization increased in MG duct, accompanied with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in ApoE mice. Inflammatory cells infiltrated into the surrounding microenvironment of MG acini, and the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated in MG acinar cells. Oxidative stress was evident in MG acinar cells of ApoE mice. Further investigation showed downregulation of PPAR-γ in MG acinar cells of ApoE mice. PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone treatment reduced the morbidity of eyelid, as well as corneal pathological changes and MG inflammation in ApoE mice.MGD and  are closely associated in ApoE mice, which represent a new model to study the pathophysiology of MGD related to dyslipidemia.Copyright © 2019.

We aim to assess the risk factors between MDR pathogen and potential covariates in SAP patients.The clinical data of 51 SAP patients who were treated from June, 2013 to December, 2016 were retrospectively collected. A total of 23 patients in the MDR group and 28 patients in the non-MDR group were reviewed. The risk factors for MDR pathogen-induced infections in SAP patients were analyzed. was the leading cause of SAP in our study. The mean duration of hospital stay was significantly longer in the patients with MDR pathogen infections (P=0.0135). The hospitalization expenses of MDR group were much higher than those in non-MDR group. The mortality of MDR group (56.%) was higher than that in non-MDR group (28.6%) (P=0.0436). Gram-negative isolates (63.8%) were commonly detected in SAP patients. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common MDR pathogens.

This retrospective study included 59 AI patients who received CMR and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examinations from June 2011 to February 2015. AI patients were divided into 2 groups: bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) group (30) and non-BAV group (29). Patients were also divided into late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) group (27) and non-LGE group (32). The baseline clinical characteristics were collected through electronic medical records. Hemodynamic parameters such as grade of AI, cardiac functional parameters and LGE mass fraction (LGE%) were measured by CMR post-processing analysis. Kappa test was used to assess the consistency of AI severity between CMR and TTE, and the multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate influence factors of myocardial fibrosis in AI patients.  (1) 56 (94.9%) patients were male, and the mean age was (44.2±11.0) years old. There was no significant difference in age and gender, hypertension, , alcoholic consumption between BAV and non-BAV group (all 0.05). There were a higher proportion of smoking history (0.008), a lower body mass index (BMI) (0.020) in the LGE group than in the non-LGE group. (2) The accuracy of CMR in diagnosis of BAV was 96.7% (29/30) compared to the gold standard. In the BAV group, 20 patients (66.7%) were with fusion of left and right cusp (L-R),  patients (16.7%) were with fusion of right and noncoronary cusp (R-N),  patients (16.7%) were with fusion of left and noncoronary cusp (L-N); patients with BAV had larger left ventricular end diastolic volume index (LVEDVi), left ventricular end systolic volume index (LVESVi), higher proportion of LGE and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) than those in non-BAV group (all 0.05). There were 19 patients with BAV in the LGE group, the cases of L-R, R-N, L-N were 10 (52.6%),  (26.3%), and 4 (21.1%), respectively. In the non-LGE group, patients with BAV of L-R, R-N, L-N were 10 (90.9%), 0, and 1 (9.1%), respectively. Patients with LGE had lower body surface area (BSA), LVEF and larger LVEDVi, LVESVi, left ventricular mass index (LVMi) and higher proportion of BAV compared patients without LGE. In addition, the proportion of moderate and severe AI patients was significantly higher in BAV group than in non-BAV group (0.009). (3) The consistency of CMR and TTE in evaluating the severity of AI patients: the agreement between TTE and CMR regarding AI severity was satisfactory (kappa value was 0.624, 95 0.402-0.831, <0.001). (4) The linear regression analysis demonstrated a negative correlation between LVEF and LGE% in BAV and non-BAV group (0.001). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of BAV was an independent risk factor of left ventricucar fibrosis (.050, 95 1.220-20.908, 0.025) after adjustment for LVEF, hypertension, LVEDVi and LVMi.  Multi-parametric CMR provides a satisfactory noninvasive tool for estimation of myocardial fibrosis and ventricular remodeling in patients with AI, and BAV is an independent risk factor for myocardial fibrosis in patients with AI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197153>Diabetic neuropathy.</a></h1><p>The global epidemic of prediabetes and diabetes has led to a corresponding epidemic of complications of these disorders. The most prevalent complication is neuropathy, of which distal symmetric polyneuropathy (for the purpose of this Primer, referred to as diabetic neuropathy) is very common. Diabetic neuropathy is a loss of sensory function beginning distally in the lower extremities that is also characterized by pain and substantial morbidity. Over time, at least 50% of individuals with diabetes develop diabetic neuropathy. Glucose control effectively halts the progression of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, but the effects are more modest in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These findings have led to new efforts to understand the aetiology of diabetic neuropathy, along with new 2017 recommendations on approaches to prevent and treat this disorder that are specific for each type of diabetes. In parallel, new guidelines for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy using distinct classes of drugs, with an emphasis on avoiding opioid use, have been issued. Although our understanding of the complexities of diabetic neuropathy has substantially evolved over the past decade, the distinct mechanisms underlying neuropathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes remains unknown.

Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d,  days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic acid. As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic acid did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and oleic acid also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619486>Association between coarse particulate matter (PM) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma among Taiwanese men.</a></h1><p>The nasopharyngeal tract traps mainly coarse particles in inhaled air.

Data were retrieved from the Taiwan Cancer Registry, the Adult Preventive Medical Services Database, and the Air Quality Monitoring Database. PM was significantly associated with a higher risk of NPC after adjusting for SO, NOx, O, age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol drinking, betel nut chewing, exercise, hypertension, diabetes, and . With PM<20.44 μg/m as the reference, the ORs and 95% CIs were 1.47; 1.03-2.11, 1.34; 0.94-1.91, and 1.68; 1.16-2.44 for 20.44≤PM<24.08, 24.08≤PM<29.27, and PM≥29.27 μg/m, respectively. PM remained significantly associated with a higher risk of NPC after further adjustments were made for the aforementioned covariates and PM The ORs; 95% CIs were 1.42; 0.96 to 2.12, 1.41; 0.94 to 2.10, and 1.71; 1.10 to 2.66 for 20.44≤PM<24.08, 24.08≤PM<29.27, and PM≥29.27 μg/m, respectively. In conclusion, PM was significantly associated with a higher risk of NPC in Taiwanese men.© American Federation for Medical Research 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Use was defined as a mammogram within the previous 1 or 2 years, analyzed separately. A logit model was employed to evaluate associations between use and comorbidities and age. Statistical significance was defined by a P value < .05 by two-sided test.Of the 36,575 women in our study sample, 45.9%, 43.6%, 3.9%, and .7% reported a history of hypertension (HTN),  (HLD), prior heart attack (MI), and prior stroke, respectively. Among women without a comorbid condition, there was 47.3% annual mammography use. HTN and HLD were associated with increased use (2. and 6.8 percentage points [pp], P< .01). In comparison, prior MI was associated with decreased annual use (-8.2 pp, P < .01). Prior stroke was not significantly associated with annual mammography (-1. pp, P = .42). Results were similar for biennial use. The age trend in use showed that the age with maximum screening use was approximately 60 years.Mammography use was higher in patients with HTN and HLD, and lower in patients with prior MI and stroke, which may reflect differences in comorbidity-related general health care use. Use increased until it peaked around age 60. An understanding of how mammography use naturally evolves as people age may help better target specific populations and improve overall use of preventive care.Copyright © 2019 American College of Radiology.

It is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in one of the two ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes encoding the intestinal and hepatic heterodimer ABCG5 (sterolin 1)/ABCG8 (sterolin 2) efflux transporters. These mutations lead to intestinal hyperabsorption and reduced hepatic secretion of cholesterol and plant sterols with subsequent accumulation of phytosterols and cholesterol in plasma and deposition in tissue (xanthoma). Phytosterols are found mainly in vegetable oils, margarine, nuts, grains, soybeans and avocados. Patients with sitosterolemia show extreme phenotypic heterogeneity from almost asymptomatic individuals to those with combined severe hypercholesterolemia at a young age, leading to increased atherosclerosis and premature cardiac death. Early abnormalities include hemolytic anemia with stomatocytosis, macrothrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. In addition to strict avoidance of phytosterol-containing foods, the use of the sterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe, possibly in combination with the bile acid-binding resin cholestyramine, is the most effective treatment option.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248199>Development of Technetium-99m-Labeled BODIPY-Based Probes Targeting Lipid Droplets Toward the Diagnosis of -Related Diseases.</a></h1><p> causes systemic lipid disorder, which leads to hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis. Thus, it is necessary to detect these syndromes early and precisely to improve prognosis. In the affected regions, abnormal formation and growth of lipid droplets is observed; therefore, lipid droplets may be a suitable target for the diagnosis of -related syndromes. In this study, we designed and synthesized [Tc]Tc-BOD and [Tc]Tc-MBOD composed of one technetium-99m and two BODIPY scaffolds with hydroxamamide (Ham) or -methylated hydroxamamide (MHam) in radiochemical yields of 54 and 35%, respectively, with a radiochemical purity of over 95%. [Tc]Tc-BOD showed significantly higher accumulation levels in foam cells than in non-foam cells (foam cells: 213.8 ± 64.8, non-foam cell: 126.2 ± 26.9 %dose/mg protein,  < 0.05) 2 h after incubation. In contrast, [Tc]Tc-MBOD showed similar accumulation levels in foam cells and non-foam cells (foam cells: 92.2 ± 23.3, non-foam cell: 83.8 ± 19.8 %dose/mg protein). In normal mice, [Tc]Tc-BOD exhibited gradual blood clearance (0. h: 4.98 ± 0.35, 6 h: 1.94 ± 0.12 %ID/g) and relatively high accumulation in the liver 6 h after administration (15.22 ± 1.72 %ID/g).

The aim of this study is to identify clinical and morphologic risk factors in the pre and postoperative AAD patients with respect to unfavorable aortic remodeling, re-operations and poor long term outcomes.123 consecutive patients who survived proximal AAD surgery were reviewed at a single institution. The medical charts and computed tomography (CT) studies of these patients were reviewed from 2005-14. The short axis area of the true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL) and the total cross-sectional area were measured from reconstructed images using centerline technique at the largest segment each of the aortic arch (AA), descending thoracic aorta (TA), aorta proximal to the celiac artery (CA), and the abdominal aorta (AbA). Survival and time to first reoperation were analyzed with Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional-hazards models. Factors associated with radiologic change were evaluated using multiple linear regression models. A significant change was defined as > 10% change (cm2) from the baseline CTA.At least one sequential CT scan was available for 62 (50%) of the 123 patients (40 M, 22 F; average age, 59.1±13. years). Mean interval (baseline and the comparison CT scan) was 779 days. In general, the TA and FL increased in size over the study period. Multivariate analysis showed that age >60 years and smoking were significantly associated with an increase in TL over time, while coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were associated with decrease TL (P=0.03).  and CAD were associated with an increase in FL size., while pre-existing aortic aneurysm, coronary surgery and hemodialysis were significant risk factors for reoperations (P=0.029). Age >60 (P=0.01), COPD (P=0.002), and male gender (P=0.02) were also associated with an increase in total area, signifying distal aneurysmal progression.Patient risk factors predict unfavorable long term morphologic outcomes in the remaining aorta after AAD surgical repair. These factors can be used as markers to identify patients who may benefit from closer surveillance and possibly earlier endovascular intervention to the distal thoracic aorta.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31272414>The prevalence of selected risk factors for non-communicable diseases in Hargeisa, Somaliland: a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory conditions and cancers, are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality globally. Information on the prevalence estimates of NCD risk factors such as smoking, low fruit & vegetable intake, physical inactivity, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity and abnormal blood lipid are scarce in Somaliland. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of these selected risk factors for NCDs among 20-69 year old women and men in Hargeisa, Somaliland.A cross-sectional study was conducted in five districts of Hargeisa (Somaliland), using the STEPwise approach to noncommunicable disease risk factor surveillance (STEPS) to collect data on demographic and behavioral characteristics and physical measurements (n = 1100). The STEPS approach is a standardized method for collecting, analysing and disseminating data on NCD risk factor burden. Fasting blood sugar, serum lipids (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides) were collected in half of the participants.The vast majority of participants had ≤1 serving of fruits daily (97.7%) and ≤ 1 serving of vegetables daily (98.2%). The proportion of participants with low physical activity levels was 78.4%. The overall prevalence of high salt intake was 18.%. The prevalence of smoking and khat chewing among men was 27 and 37% respectively, and negligible among women. In women, the prevalence of hypertension increased from 15% in the age group 20-34 years to 67% in the age group 50-69 years, the prevalence of overweight and obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m) from 51 to 73%, and the prevalence of diabetes from 3 to 22%. Similar age-trends were seen in men.Most of the selected risk factors for noncommunicable diseases were high and increased by age in both women and men. Overweight and obesity and low physical activity needs intervention in women, while hypertension and low fruit and vegetable consumption needs intervention in both men and women. Somaliland health authorities should develop and/or strengthen health services that can help in treating persons with hypertension and , and prevent a future burden of NCDs resulting from a high prevalence of NCD risk factors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384369>The Impact of Repeated Cardioversions for Atrial Fibrillation on Stroke, Hospitalizations, and Catheter Ablation Outcomes.</a></h1><p>Long-term outcomes after direct current cardioversion (DCCV) in patients that receive anticoagulation have demonstrated to have no adverse sequela. Less is known about the impact on atrial fibrillation (AF) outcomes and resource utilization of repeated DCCVs that are often required for long-term rhythm control.A total of 4,135 AF patients >18 years of age that underwent DCCV with long-term system follow-up were evaluated. Patients were stratified by the number of DCCVs received: 1 (n=2,201), 2-4 (n=1,748), and ≥ (n=186). Multivariable Cox hazard regression was used to determine the association of DCCV categories to the outcomes of death, AF hospitalization, AF ablation, DCCVs, and stroke/transient ischemic attack.The average follow-up of the patient population was 1,633.1±1,232.9 (median: 1,438.0) days. Patients who underwent 2-4 and ≥ DCCVs had more comorbidities, namely hypertension,  and heart failure. Anticoagulation use was common at the time of DCCV in all groups (89.1%, 91.2%, 91.9%, p=0.06) and amiodarone use increased with increasing DCCV category (30.1%, 43.4%, 52.2, p<0.0001). At  years, patients that received more DCCVs had higher rates of repeat DCCVs, AF hospitalizations, and ablations. Stroke rates were not increased. Though not statistically significant, -year death was increased when comparing DCCV > vs. 1, (HR=1.32 [0.89-1.94], p=0.17).This study found that the increasing number of DCCVs, despite escalation of other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies, is a long-term independent risk factor for repeat DCCVs, ablations, and AF hospitalizations among AF patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217924>The effects of  (Chinese hawthorn) on metabolic syndrome: A review.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome is described as a group of risk factors in which at least three unhealthy medical conditions, including obesity, high blood sugar, hypertension or dyslipidemia occur simultaneously in a patient. These conditions raise the risk for diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. Many recent studies have focused on herbal remedies and their pharmacological effects on metabolic syndrome.  or Chinese hawthorn has been widely used in the treatment of  and cardiovascular diseases. Its leaves, fruits and seeds have various active substances such as, flavonoids, triterpenic acids and sesquiterpenes, which through different mechanisms can be beneficial in metabolic syndrome. Flavonoids found in the leaves of hawthorn can significantly reduce atherosclerotic lesion areas, the fruit extracts contain two triterpenic acids (oleanolic acid and ursolic acid), that have the ability to inhibit the acyl-coA-cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) enzyme and as a result reduce very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Another example regards a sesquiterpene found in the seeds of , which exhibits the ability to inhibit platelet aggregation, thus showing antithrombotic activity. Various studies have shown that  can have beneficial effects on controlling and treating high blood sugar, dyslipidemia, obesity and atherosclerosis.

A Cox hazard model with metabolism-related diseases as time-dependent covariates was adapted to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of cataracts between SGAs and FGAs groups.During the 8-year follow-up, patients receiving SGAs were associated with a higher risk of cataract than those receiving FGAs with an adjusted HR of 1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-2.36). Patients receiving high-metabolic-risk SGAs (clozapine and olanzapine) showed the highest risk of cataracts among SGAs when compared with those receiving FGAs (aHR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.35-4.88). SGAs demonstrated a stronger contribution in the risk of cataract in patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) and  than in those developed these diseases. Patients who developed DM or  after receiving antipsychotics had an approximately 2.-fold increased cataract risk over those who did not develop these diseases.Regardless of the condition of metabolic-related diseases, SGAs were independently associated with an increased risk of cataract. DM and  developed after antipsychotics contributed to the risk of cataract risk.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Results from the SITS-MENA Registry.</a></h1><p>Intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in the Middle-East and North African (MENA) countries is still confined to the main urban and university hospitals. This was a prospective observational study to examine outcomes of intravenous thrombolysis-treated stroke patients in the MENA region compared to the non-MENA stroke cohort in the SITS International Registry.Of 32,160 patients with ischemic stroke registered using the SITS intravenous thrombolysis protocol between June 2014 and May 2016, 500 (1.6%) were recruited in MENA. Compared to non-MENA (all  < 0.001), median age in MENA was 55 versus 73 years, NIH Stroke Scale score 12 versus 9, onset-to-treatment time 138 versus 155 min and door-to-needle time 54 min versus 64 min. Hypertension was the most reported risk factor, but lower in MENA (51.7 vs. 69.7%). Diabetes was more frequent in MENA (28. vs. 20.8%) as well as smoking (20.8 vs. 15.9%).  was less observed in MENA (17.6 vs. 29.3%). Functional independence (mRS 0-2) at seven days or discharge was similar (53% vs. 52% in non-MENA), with mortality slightly lower in MENA (2.3% vs. 4.8%). SICH rates by SITS-MOST definition were low (<1.4%) in both groups.Intravenous thrombolysis patients in MENA were younger, had more severe strokes and more often diabetes. Although stroke severity was higher in MENA, short-term functional independency and mortality were not worse compared to non-MENA, which could partly be explained by younger age and shorter OTT in MENA. Decreasing the burden of stroke in this young population should be prioritized.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31150976>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and blood lipid levels in pre-diabetic adults-longitudinal analysis of the diabetes prevention program outcomes study.</a></h1><p>Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may interfere with lipid regulation. However, most previous studies were cross-sectional with the risk of reverse causation, suggesting a need for long-term prospective studies. We examined the relationship of baseline plasma PFAS concentrations with repeated measures of blood lipids. We included 888 prediabetic adults from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and DPP Outcomes Study, who had measurements of 6 plasma PFAS concentrations at baseline (1996-1999) and repeated measures of blood lipids over 15 years of follow-up, and were initially randomized to placebo or a lifestyle intervention. We used linear regression to examine cross-sectional associations of PFAS concentrations and lipid levels at baseline, and evaluated prospective risks of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia using Cox proportional hazard models, and tested for effect modification by study arm. Participants (65.9% female, 57.0% White, 65.9% aged 40-59 years) had comparable PFAS concentrations [e.g., median (IQR) perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) 4.9 ng/mL (3.2)] with the general U.S. population in 1999-2000. We observed higher total cholesterol at baseline per doubling of PFOA (β: 6.1 mg/dL, 95% CI: 3.1, 9.04), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS, β: 2.2 mg/dL, 95% CI: 0.2, 4.3), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA, β: 2.9 mg/dL, 95% CI: 0.7, .0). Prospectively, baseline concentrations of several PFASs, including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS and PFNA, predicted higher risks of incident hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, but only in the placebo group and not the lifestyle intervention group. For example, participants in the placebo group with PFOA concentration > median (4.9 ng/mL) were almost twice as likely (HR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.25, 2.88) to develop hypertriglyceridemia compared to those ≤median. Findings suggest adverse effects of some PFASs on lipid profiles in prediabetic adults. However, the detrimental effect was attenuated with a lifestyle intervention.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.
