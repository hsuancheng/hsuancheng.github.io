Cirrhosis is a major cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality. Macrophages play a key role in fibrosis progression and reversal. However, the signals that determine fibrogenic vs fibrolytic macrophage function remain ill defined. We studied the role of interleukin-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα), a potential central switch of macrophage polarization, in  fibrosis progression and reversal. We demonstrate that inflammatory monocyte infiltration and  fibrogenesis were suppressed in general IL-4Rα as well as in macrophage-specific IL-4Rα (IL-4Rα) mice. However, with deletion of IL-4Rα spontaneous fibrosis reversal was retarded. Results were replicated by pharmacological intervention using IL-4Rα-specific antisense oligonucleotides. Retarded resolution was linked to the loss of -type resident macrophages, which secreted MMP-12 through IL-4 and IL-13-mediated phospho-STAT6 activation. We conclude that IL-4Rα signaling regulates macrophage functional polarization in a context-dependent manner. Pharmacological targeting of macrophage polarization therefore requires disease stage-specific treatment strategies.Alternative (-type) macrophage activation through IL-4Rα promotes  inflammation and fibrosis progression but speeds up fibrosis reversal. This demonstrates context dependent, opposing roles of -type macrophages. During reversal IL-4Rα induces fibrolytic MMPs, especially MMP-12, through STAT6. -specific antisense oligonucleotides efficiently block IL-4Rα expression and attenuate fibrosis progression.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The use of synbiotics has been proposed as a probable management strategy for patients with NAFLD.We investigated the effects of synbiotic yogurt on hepatic steatosis and  enzymes as primary outcomes and on oxidative stress markers, adipokine concentration, and gut peptide concentration as secondary outcomes in patients with NAFLD.In this 24-wk, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial, 102 patients [50 men and 52 women; mean age: 40 y; body mass index (in kg/) (mean ± SD): 31.2 ± 4.9] were randomly assigned to 3 groups, including 2 intervention groups and 1 control group. The intervention groups consumed 300 g synbiotic yogurt containing 108 colony-forming units Bifidobacterium animalis/mL and 1.5 g inulin or conventional yogurt daily and were advised to follow a healthy lifestyle (i.e., diet and exercise). The control group was advised to follow a healthy lifestyle alone. We evaluated differences between groups in  function measures by using repeated-measures ANOVA, ANCOVA, and logistic regression.At the end of the study, the grades of NAFLD, as determined by ultrasonography, showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group compared with the conventional and control groups (P < 0.001). The following significant mean ± SD decreases were seen in the synbiotic, conventional, and control groups, respectively: serum concentration of alanine aminotransferase (-14.5 ± 15.6 compared with 4.6 ± 15.4 and 3.1 ± 14.4 IU/L; P = 0.008), aspartate aminotransferase (-7.5 ± 6.1 compared with 3.0 ± 8.2 and 3.1 ± 5.7 IU/L; P < 0.001), alkaline phosphatase (-26.2 ± 16.8 compared with 3.4 ± 30.1 and 1.5 ± 31.9 IU/L; P = 0.024), and γ-glutamyltransferase (-6.0 ± 6.0 compared with 1.0 ± 6.4 and 7.6 ± 11.4 IU/L; P < 0.001).Synbiotic yogurt consumption improved hepatic steatosis and  enzyme concentrations in patients with NAFLD.

It is characterized by a wide spectrum of hepatic changes, which may progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. NAFLD is considered a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome; however, mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of NAFLD are still unclear. Resident and recruited macrophages are key players in the homeostatic function of the  and in the progression of NAFLD to NASH. Progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the polarized activation of macrophages. New NAFLD therapies will likely involve modification of macrophage polarization by restraining M1 activation or driving  activation. Carotenoids are potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory micronutrients that have been used to prevent and treat NAFLD. In addition to their antioxidative action, carotenoids can regulate macrophage polarization and thereby halt the progression of NASH. In this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of macrophage polarization and the function of  macrophages/Kupffer cells in NAFLD. From our review, we propose that dietary carotenoids, such as β-cryptoxanthin and astaxanthin, be used to prevent or treat NAFLD through the regulation of macrophage polarization and  homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26105806> acid-binding protein 5 limits the anti-inflammatory response in murine macrophages.</a></h2><p>The beginning stages of  damage induced by various etiologies (i.e. high fat diet, alcohol consumption, toxin exposure) are characterized by abnormal accumulation of lipid in . Alterations in intracellular lipid transport, storage, and metabolism accompanied by cellular insult within the  play an important role in the pathogenesis of  disease, often involving a sustained inflammatory response. The intracellular lipid transporter,  acid binding protein 5 (FABP5), is highly expressed in macrophages and may play an important role in the hepatic inflammatory response after endotoxin exposure in mice. This study tested the hypothesis that FABP5 regulates macrophage response to LPS in male C57bl/6 (wild type) and FABP5 knockout mice, both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with LPS revealed that loss of FABP5 enhances the number of hepatic F4/80(+) macrophages in the  despite limited  injury. Conversely, FABP5 knock out mice display higher mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, arginase, YM-1, and Fizz-1 in  compared to wild type mice. Bone marrow derived macrophages stimulated with inflammatory (LPS and IFN-γ) or anti-inflammatory (IL-4) mediators also showed significantly higher expression of anti-inflammatory/regulatory factors. These findings reveal a regulatory role of FABP5 in the acute inflammatory response to LPS-induced  injury, which is consistent with the principle finding that FABP5 is a regulator of macrophage phenotype. Specifically, these findings demonstrate that loss of FABP5 promotes a more anti-inflammatory response.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Drug options are limited with varying results. Nigella sativa in the form of herbal medicine could be another option because of its strong historical background. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect Nigella sativa on various parameters in patients of NAFLD.A randomized controlled trial was conducted at outpatient clinic of medical unit-1 of Sheikh Zayed Medical College/Hospital, Rahim Yar Khan, in which seventy patients of NAFLD were divided in to interventional and non-interventional groups.

Although several studies have directly evaluated the role of KCs in different metabolic situations in the , the definite characteristics of KCs remain unknown. KC depletion techniques are used to determine the functions of KCs under metabolic challenges; however, there is debate about their precise role even after successful ablation. While some KC ablation studies showed improvement in insulin resistance,  and metabolic parameters, other reports, under the similar conditions, have not. Some studies have rationalized the KCs dual actions in  metabolic states by arguing their M1 and  biases. Activated M1 KCs secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and other mediators to create inflammatory stress which initiates inflammatory signalling in hepatocytes to disrupt the metabolic scenario. In contrast,  KCs generate anti-inflammatory cytokines and mediators which improve glucose and lipid metabolic states within the . Unfortunately, the M1/ bias does not provide reliable explanation as KCs depletion shows strikingly different results. Despite many investigational studies on this topic, a comprehensive review of these studies is lacking. This review attempts to address the issues related with the dichotomy of KCs effects in lipid metabolism. This review not only warns the future studies to carefully analyze the results that are drawn from KCs effects on lipid metabolism but also suggest to evaluate animal models and KCs depletion techniques as an equally important cofactor.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337151>The Number of  Galectin-3 Positive Cells Is Dually Correlated with NAFLD Severity in Children.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a complex disease ranging from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Galectin-3 (Gal-3), which is a β-galactoside binding protein, has been associated with  fibrosis, but its role in NAFLD remains elusive. We investigated the expression of Gal-3 in  resident cells and its potential association with  damage in 40 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD. We found that several  cells expressed Gal-3. The number of total Gal-3 positive cells decreased with the severity of disease and the cells were correlated with the presence of steatosis and the diagnosis of NASH. CD68 macrophages expressed Gal-3 but the number CD68/Gal-3 positive cells was significantly reduced in patients diagnosed with steatosis and NASH. Triple CD68/CD206/Gal-3, which represented the subpopulation of  macrophages, were mainly present in patients without NASH, and clearly reduced in patients with steatosis and NASH. On the contrary, the number of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)/Gal-3 positive cells increased with the severity of fibrosis in children with NAFLD. Our data demonstrated that the number of Gal-3 positive cells was associated with tissue damage in different ways, which suggests a dual role of this protein in the pathogenesis of pediatric NAFLD, even if the role of Gal-3 deserves further studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914267>Macrophage p38α promotes nutritional steatohepatitis through M1 polarization.</a></h2><p>p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are important inflammatory factors. p38α alteration has been implicated in both human and mouse inflammatory disease models. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the cell type-specific role of p38α in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Human  tissues were obtained from 27 patients with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and 20 control individuals. NASH was established and compared between hepatocyte-specific p38α knockout (p38α), macrophage-specific p38α knockout (p38α) and wild-type (p38α) mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD), high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (HFHC), or methionine-and choline-deficient diet (MCD). p38 inhibitors were administered to HFHC-fed wild-type mice for disease treatment.p38α was significantly upregulated in the  tissues of patients with NAFLD. Compared to p38α littermates, p38α mice developed significant nutritional steatohepatitis induced by HFD, HFHC or MCD. Meanwhile, p38α mice exhibited less severe steatohepatitis and insulin resistance than p38α mice in response to a HFHC or MCD. The effect of macrophage p38α in promoting steatohepatitis was mediated by the induction of pro-inflammatory factors (CXCL2, IL-1β, CXCL10 and IL-6) secreted by M1 macrophages and associated signaling pathways. p38α mice exhibited  anti-inflammatory polarization as demonstrated by increased CD45F4/80CD11bCD206  macrophages and enhanced arginase activity in  tissues. Primary hepatocytes from p38α mice showed decreased steatosis and inflammatory damage. In a co-culture system, p38α deleted macrophages attenuated steatohepatitic changes in hepatocytes through decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, CXCL10 and IL-6), which mediate M1 macrophage polarization in p38α mice. Restoration of TNF-α, CXCL10 or IL-6 induced lipid accumulation and inflammatory responses in p38α hepatocytes co-cultured with p38α macrophages. Moreover, pharmacological p38 inhibitors suppressed HFHC-induced steatohepatitis.Macrophage p38α promotes the progression of steatohepatitis by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and M1 polarization. p38 inhibition protects against steatohepatitis. LAY SUMMARY: p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are important inflammatory factors. In the present study, we demonstrated that p38α is upregulated in  tissues of patients with non-alcoholic  diseases. Genetic deletion of p38α in macrophages led to ameliorated nutritional steatohepatitis in mice through decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and increased  macrophage polarization.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the .

To further investigate these effects, RNA-Seq data were integrated with computationally identified putative dioxin response elements, and complementary targeted metabolomic and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ChIP-Seq data from female C57BL/6 mice gavaged with TCDD every 4 days for 28 days. Data integration using CytoKEGG with manual curation identified dose-dependent alterations in central carbon and amino acid metabolism. More specifically, TCDD increased pyruvate kinase isoform  (PKM2) gene and protein expression. PKM2 has lower catalytic activity resulting in decreased glycolytic flux and the accumulation of upstream intermediates that were redirected to the pentose phosphate pathway and serine/folate biosynthesis, 2 important NADPH producing pathways stemming from glycolysis. In addition, the GAC:KGA glutaminase (GLS1) protein isoform ratio was increased, consistent with increases in glutaminolysis which serves an anaplerotic role for the TCA cycle and compensates for the reduced glycolytic flux. Collectively, gene expression, protein, and metabolite changes were indicative of increases in NADPH production in support of cytochrome P450 activity and ROS defenses. This AhR-mediated metabolic reprogramming is similar to the Warburg effect and represents a novel advantageous defense mechanism to increase anti-oxidant capacity in normal differentiated hepatocytes.© The Author 2015.

Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative modulator of insulin and cytokine signaling, is a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes and obesity. We investigated the impact of PTP1B deficiency during NAFLD, particularly in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).NASH features were evaluated in livers from wild-type (PTP1BWT) and PTP1B-deficient (PTP1BKO) mice fed methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) for 8 weeks. A recovery model was established by replacing MCD to chow diet (CHD) for 2-7 days. Non-parenchymal  cells (NPCs) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Oval cells markers were measured in human and mouse livers with NASH, and in oval cells from PTP1BWT and PTP1BKO mice.PTP1BWT mice fed MCD for 8 weeks exhibited NASH, NPCs infiltration, and elevated Fgf21, Il6 and Il1b mRNAs. These parameters decreased after switching to CHD. PTP1B deficiency accelerated MCD-induced NASH. Conversely, after switching to CHD, PTP1BKO mice rapidly reverted NASH compared to PTP1BWT mice in parallel to the normalization of serum triglycerides (TG) levels. Among NPCs, a drop in cytotoxic natural killer T (NKT) subpopulation was detected in PTP1BKO livers during recovery, and in these conditions  macrophage markers were up-regulated. Oval cells markers (EpCAM and cytokeratin 19) significantly increased during NASH only in PTP1B-deficient livers. HGF-mediated signaling and proliferative capacity were enhanced in PTP1BKO oval cells. In NASH patients, oval cells markers were also elevated.PTP1B elicits a dual role in NASH progression and reversion. Additionally, our results support a new role for PTP1B in oval cell proliferation during NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Segmentation and calculation of visceral (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were also performed.There was no significant difference in mean  T2* values between obese (body mass index, BMI >30 kg/) and non-obese (BMI ≤30 kg/) subjects. After controlling for other covariates, no statistically significant association was detected between  T2* values and VFA, SFA and VFA/SFA ratio. The drop in the relative signal intensity as an indicator of steatosis and serum ferritin predicted  T2* values that almost had the same strength (standardized β of -0.41 and -0.41, respectively).Central obesity indices are not correlated with estimated  iron content by MRI. Hepatic steatosis and serum ferritin seem to be the best predictors of hepatic T2* value.

Mets was defined according to the Chinese Medical Association Diabetes Branch definition that included hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used to analyze multivariate relative risk (RR) of repeated observations of ALT and AST in quartiles for Mets or its components according to gender.In all, 826 Mets cases were reported. Adjustment of relevant parameters indicated that time-varying changes in ALT and AST levels were positively associated with the incidence of Mets in a dose-response manner. Positive association between high ALT levels and  was much stronger than that between high AST levels and , particularly in male participants. These associations were consistently observed in the following subgroups: participants with ALT and AST levels of <40 U/L, participants with of <25 kg/, and participants with non-. Furthermore, participants with 2 Mets components at baseline showed lower multivariate adjusted RRs of ALT and AST for Mets than participants with 0-1 Mets component.These results suggested that elevated serum ALT and AST levels were early biomarkers of Mets or its components.Copyright © 2016 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

Besides an extended  and metabolic work-up, interleukin (IL) 1B, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL23, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α and interferon (INF) γ were measured in plasma obtained from P and HV blood by means of multiplex immunoassay. The T helper (Th)1/Th2, the macrophage M1/ and the IL10/IL17a ratios were calculated.A decrease of the P-IL10/IL17-ratio and an increase of the P-M1/-ratio (p<0.05) were observed in NASH versus no-NASH patients. A P-M1/-ratio increase was detected also in patients with portal hypertension in comparison with patients without it (p<0.05). Moreover diabetic patients showed an increase of the P-Th1/Th2-ratio in comparison with non-diabetic ones (p<0.05). The P-M1/ ratio positively correlated with steatosis grade (r = 0.39, p = 0.02) and insulin (r = 0.47, p = 0.003). The HV-M1/ ratio positively correlated with fasting insulin and Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (r = 0.47, p = 0.003). IL6 correlated with the visceral fat amount (r = 0.36, p = 0.02). The P- and HV-IL10/IL17 ratios negatively correlated with fasting insulin (respectively r = -0.4, p = 0.005 and r = 0.4, p = 0.01).A proinflammatory cytokine state is associated with more disturbed metabolic, histological, and haemodynamic features in NAFLD obese patients. An increase of the M1/ ratio and a decrease of the IL10/IL17 ratio play a key role in this process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27049488>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in morbid obese patients: coffee consumption vs. disease severity.</a></h2><p>Obesity correlates with nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and occurs in 90 to 100% of severely obese individuals (body mass index [BMI] > 35 kg/). Coffee consumption (CC) has been associated with reduced progression of fibrosis in both hepatitis C infection and NAFLD; however, this topic is still under discussion when this  disease affects severely obese individuals.To assess the association between CC, insulin resistance (IR) and histological NAFLD morbid obese patients.Cross-sectional study, including obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery,  biopsy and histological diagnosis between September 2013 and August 2014. The patients were classified into 3 groups according to their weekly CC: 0- 239.9 mL; 240-2099.9 mL and ≥ 2100 mL.A total of 112 obese individuals were included (BMI = 41.9 ± 4.3 kg/), with a mean age of 34.7 ± 7.4 years; 68.6% were women. CC was reported by 72.3% of patients. There were no statistical significant differences between groups regarding the presence of IR (84.8% vs. 74.2% vs. 75.9%; p = 0.536). Progressively higher percentages of individuals with normal  histology were observed (14.7% vs. 21.9% vs. 24.3%). NASH (65.7% vs. 70.3% vs. 57.5%) were observed among those who consumed greater coffee volumes (p = 0.812).

RAW264.7 macrophages were incubated with different kinds of  acids including saturated  acids-palmitic acid (PA), monounsaturated  acids-oleic acid (OA) and polyunsaturated  acids-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and cell culture supernatants were collected to prepare conditioned medium (CM). Hepatocytes were isolated by in situ perfusion of the  with collagenase in mice, and a macrophage-hepatocyte CM co-culture system was established. Macrophage M1/ phenotype markers were detected by Real-time PCR. Lipid synthesis and decomposition related mRNA and protein expressions in hepatocytes were detected by Real-time PCR and Western Blot. Lipid depositions in hepatocytes were detected by oil red O staining. An analysis of variance was used for comparison of means between multiple groups.  Compared with control groups, PA polarized macrophages to a M1 phenotype (expression of TNF-α and IL-6 significantly increased, F≥22.68, P < 0.01), OA polarized macrophages to a M1/ mixed phenotype (expression of IL-6, Mrc2 and IL-10 increased F≥4.94, P < 0.05) and DHA polarized macrophages to a  phenotype (expression of Mrc2 and IL-10 significantly increased, F≥4.94, P < 0.01). CM-PA significantly increased lipid synthesis related genes, including SREBP1C, ACC1 mRNA expression (F≥5.66, P < 0.01) and FASN, ACC1 protein expression (F≥38.34, P < 0.05) in hepatocytes, and decreased lipid decomposition gene ACOX1 protein expression (F=154.48, P < 0.01). CM-OA affected several lipid metabolism genes expression. CM-DHA significantly increased CPT1A mRNA expression (F = 10.30, P < 0.01) and ACOX1, CPT1A protein expression (F≥47.06, P < 0.05), and decreased SREBP1C, ACC1 protein expression (F≥65.84, P < 0.05) in hepatocytes. Massive lipid droplets were deposited in hepatocytes in CM-PA treated hepatocytes, and a few amount of lipid droplets were deposited in CM-DHA treated hepatocytes.  Different  acids affect the balance of lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and  by inducing macrophage M1 /  polarization, thus promoting or delaying the progression of non-alcoholic  disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27063274>Current Pharmacologic Therapy for Nonalcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Weight loss, regular exercise, and diet composition modification seem to improve biochemical and histologic abnormalities.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between NAFLD and metabolic syndrome in a Chinese population.Data from subjects were retrospectively collected from 2006 to 2009. The exclusion criteria included significant consumption of alcohol and chronic hepatitis B and C. The patients were assigned to two groups according to ultrasound findings: normal group and  group. The  function of patients was determined by assessing serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed based on the 2005 International Diabetes Federation criteria.A total of 7568 subjects were enrolled and 5736 (75.8%) and 1832 (24.2%) patients were assigned to the normal and  groups, respectively. The  group had significant male predominance (69.7% vs 56.0%), higher body mass index (mean, 26.67 vs 23.55 kg/) compared with the normal group.

Metformin, a first-line oral agent used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, exhibits efficacy in metabolic reprogramming fueling changes in cell growth and proliferation for multiple cancer types, including HCC. However, the molecular mechanism by which metformin delays hepatocarcinogenesis in individuals with hepatic steatosis remains rare. Here, we investigate the preventive efficacy of metformin in a rapid AKT/c-Met-triggered HCC mouse model featuring excessive levels of steatosis. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, Oil Red O staining and immunoblotting were applied for mechanistic investigations. Pharmacological and biochemical strategies were employed to illuminate molecular evidence for HCC cell lines. The results show that metformin obstructs the malignant transformation of hepatocytes in AKT/c-Met mice. Mechanistically, metformin reduces the expression of phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) and two forms of proto-oncogenes, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc, in AKT/c-Met mice. Moreover, metformin ameliorates FASN-mediated aberrant lipogenesis and HK2/PKM2-driven ATP generation in vivo. Furthermore, metformin represses the expression of FASN and HK-2 by targeting c-Myc in an AMPK-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, metformin is effective at inhibiting PKM2 expression in the presence of an AMPK inhibitor compound C, suggesting that its functioning in PKM2 is AMPK-independent. Our study experimentally validates a novel molecular mechanism by which metformin alleviates enhanced lipogenesis and high energy metabolism during hepatocarcinogenesis, indicating that metformin may serve as an agent for the prevention of HCC in patients with nonalcoholic  diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, their role in the development of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the alterations of phenotype and immunological function of MAIT cells in NAFLD. Analysis of PBMCs in 60 patients with NAFLD and 48 healthy controls (HC) revealed that circulating MAIT cell frequency decreased in NAFLD, especially in the patients with higher serum levels of γ-glutamyl transferase or total triglyceride. Functional alterations of circulating MAIT cells were also detected in NAFLD patients, such as the increased production of IL-4 whereas the decreased production of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Furthermore, elevated expression of CXCR6 was observed in circulating MAIT cells of patients. Meanwhile, we found an increased number of MAIT cells in the livers of NAFLD, and the number was even greater in patients with higher NAFLD activity score. Moreover, activated MAIT cells induced monocytes/macrophages differentiation into  phenotype . Additionally, MAIT cells were enriched and displayed Th2 type cytokines profile in livers of wild type mice fed with methionine and choline deficient diet (MCD). Notably, mice deficient of MAIT cells exhibited more severe hepatic steatosis and inflammation upon MCD, accompanied with more CD11c proinflammatory macrophages (M1) and less CD206 anti-inflammatory macrophages () in livers. Our results indicate that MAIT cells protect against inflammation in NAFLD through producing regulatory cytokines and inducing anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization, which may provide novel therapeutic strategies for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29248877> acid oxidation contributes to IL-1β secretion in  macrophages and promotes macrophage-mediated tumor cell migration.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are predominantly  phenotype in solid cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Though differentiation of  macrophages has been recently linked to  acid oxidation (FAO), whether FAO plays a role in functional maintenance of  macrophages is still unclear. Here, we used an in vitro model to mimic TAM-HCC interaction in tumor microenvironment. We found that  monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells through an FAO-dependent way. Further investigations identified that IL-1β mediated the pro-migratory effect of  MDM. Using etomoxir and siRNA to inhibit FAO and palmitate to enhance FAO, we showed that FAO was responsible for the up-regulated secretion of IL-1β and, thus, the pro-migratory effect in  MDMs. In addition, we proved that IL-1β induction was reactive oxygen species and NLRP3-dependent. Our study demonstrates that FAO plays a key role in functional human  macrophages by enhancing IL-1β secretion to promote HCC cell migration. These findings provide evidence for different dependency of energy sources in macrophages with distinct phenotypes and functions, and suggest a novel strategy to treat HCC by reprogramming cell metabolism or modulating tumor microenvironment.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28579299>SGLT2 Inhibition by Empagliflozin Promotes Fat Utilization and Browning and Attenuates Inflammation and Insulin Resistance by Polarizing  Macrophages in Diet-induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion (UGE), leading to blood glucose reductions and weight loss. However, the impacts of SGLT2 inhibition on energy homeostasis and obesity-induced insulin resistance are less well known. Here, we show that empagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, enhanced energy expenditure and attenuated inflammation and insulin resistance in high-fat-diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. C57BL/6J mice were pair-fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a HFD with empagliflozin for 16weeks. Empagliflozin administration increased UGE in the DIO mice, whereas it suppressed HFD-induced weight gain, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. Moreover, empagliflozin shifted energy metabolism towards fat utilization, elevated AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carbolxylase phosphorylation in skeletal muscle, and increased hepatic and plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels. Importantly, empagliflozin increased energy expenditure, heat production, and the expression of uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat and in inguinal and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT). Furthermore, empagliflozin reduced M1-polarized macrophage accumulation while inducing the anti-inflammatory  phenotype of macrophages within WAT and , lowering plasma TNFα levels and attenuating obesity-related chronic inflammation.

Fifteen participants (8F, Age: 49.9±3.6yr; BMI: 31.0±1.5kg/; VO2peak: 23.2±1.2mg/kg/min) with prediabetes (ADA criteria, 75g OGTT and/or HbA1c) underwent a time-course matched Control, and isocaloric (200kcal) exercise at moderate (MIE; at lactate threshold (LT)), and high-intensity (HIE; 75% of difference between LT and VO2peak). A 75g OGTT was conducted 1 hour post-exercise/Control, and plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and free  acids were determined for calculations of skeletal muscle (1/Oral Minimal Model; SMIR), hepatic (HOMAIR), and adipose (ADIPOSEIR) IR. Insulin secretion rates were determined by deconvolution modeling for GSIS, and disposition index (DI; GSIS/IR; DISMIR, DIHOMAIR, DIADIPOSEIR) calculations. Compared to Control, exercise lowered SMIR independent of intensity (P<0.05), with HIE raising HOMAIR and ADIPOSEIR compared with Control (P<0.05). GSIS was not reduced following exercise, but DIHOMAIR and DIADIPOSEIR were lowered more following HIE compared with Control (P<0.05). However, DISMIR increased in an intensity based manner relative to Control (P<0.05), which corresponded with lower post-prandial blood glucose levels. Taken together, pancreatic insulin secretion adjusts in an exercise intensity dependent manner to match the level of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle,  and adipose tissue. Further work is warranted to understand the mechanism by which exercise influences the cross-talk between tissues that regulate blood glucose in people with prediabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30683312>Liraglutide protects against inflammatory stress in non-alcoholic  by modulating Kupffer cells  polarization via cAMP-PKA-STAT3 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the second major chronic  disease world-wide and growing.

The mice underwent four weeks of intraperitoneal injections of liraglutide (0.6 mg/kg body weight). In the NAFLD model used in this study, the  index, the body weight, and the serum levels of ALT, AST, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were meaningfully improved. In sections using H&E and Oil Red O staining, hepatic steatosis was significantly improved. Liraglutide decreased  inflammation and the inflammatory properties of Kupffer cells in the NAFLD mouse model and there was a higher ratio of /M1 Kupffer cells. In vitro studies found that Liraglutide treatment modulates Kupffer cells to -like activation via the cAMP-PKA-STAT3 signaling pathway. The perilous effects of a high-fat diet were alleviated by liraglutide, including hepatic steatosis, by modulating Kupffer cells  polarization via the cAMP-PKA-STAT3 signaling pathway.

We investigated whether NAFLD, as determined by the  index (FLI), could predict incident CKD in 10-year prospective cohort study. We also assessed the clinical utility of FLI to predict the development of CKD.6,238 adults aged 40 to 69 years without baseline CKD from the Ansan-Ansung cohort were examined. Patients were classified according to FLI as follows: FLI<30, no NAFLD; FLI≥60, NAFLD; and 30≤ FLI<60, intermediate. Incident CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min per 1.73 . The clinical utility of FLI in predicting incident CKD was estimated via area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analyses.During an average of 10 years of follow-up, 724 subjects (15.21%) developed CKD. The adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] for incident CKD increased in a graded manner with FLI increased (<30 vs. 30-59 vs. ≥60 = 1 vs. 1.17 [0.997-1.375] vs. 1.459 [1.189-1.791], respectively, P for trend = 0.0012).

The transcription factor, PPARα, regulates lipid metabolism in mammals; however, the detailed mechanism whereby PPARαb regulates Elovls remains largely unknown in fish. In the present study, we report the full length cDNA sequence of Trachinotus ovatus Elovl4a (ToElovl4a), which encodes a 320 amino acid polypeptide that possesses five putative membrane-spanning domains, a conserved HXXHH histidine motif and an ER retrieval signal. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the deduced protein of ToElovl4a is highly conserved with the Oreochromis niloticus corresponding homologue. Moreover, functional characterization by heterologous expression in yeast indicated that ToElovl4a can elongate C18 up to C20 polyunsaturated  acids. A nutritional study showed that the protein expressions of ToElovl4a in the brain and  were not significantly affected among the different treatments. The region from PGL3-basic-Elovl4a-5 (-148 bp to +258 bp) is defined as the core promoter via a progressive deletion mutation of ToElovl4a. The results from promoter activity assays suggest that ToElovl4a transcription is positively regulated by PPARαb. Mutation analyses indicated that the  binding site of PPARαb is functionally important for protein binding, and transcriptional activity of the ToElovl4a promoter significantly decreased after targeted mutation. Furthermore, PPARαb RNA interference reduced ToPPARαb and ToElovl4a expression at the protein levels in a time-dependent manner. In summary, PPARαb may promote the biosynthesis of LC-PUFA by regulating ToElovl4a expression in fish.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28018292>Obesity: An Immunometabolic Perspective.</a></h2><p>Obesity, characterized by chronic activation of inflammatory pathways, is a critical factor contributing to insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Free  acids (FFAs) are increased in obesity and are implicated as proximate causes of IR and induction of inflammatory signaling in adipose, , muscle, and pancreas. Cells of the innate immune system produce cytokines, and other factors that affect insulin signaling and result in the development of IR. In the lean state, adipose tissue is populated by adipose tissue macrophage of the anti-inflammatory  type (ATM2) and natural killer (NK) cells; this maintains the insulin-sensitive phenotype because ATM2 cells secrete IL10. In contrast, obesity induces lipolysis and release of pro-inflammatory FFAs and factors, such as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which recruit blood monocytes in adipose tissue, where they are converted to macrophages of the highly pro-inflammatory M1-type (ATM1). Activated ATM1 produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, interleukin-1β, IL-6, leukotriene B4, nitric oxide (NO), and resistin that work in a paracrine fashion and cause IR in adipose tissue. In the , both pro-inflammatory Kupffer cells (M1-KCs) and recruited hepatic macrophages (Ly6C) contribute to decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity. The present mini-review will update the bidirectional interaction between the immune system and obesity-induced changes in metabolism in adipose tissue and  and the metabolic consequences thereof.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25632192>Characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>To determine characteristics and prognostic predictors of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in association with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).We reviewed the records of all patients with NAFLD associated HCC between 2000 and 2012. Data collected included demographics; histology; presence or absence of cirrhosis, size and number of HCC, alpha-fetoprotein, body mass index (BMI), and the presence of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidaemia.Fifty-four patients with NAFLD associated HCC were identified. Mean age was 64 years with 87% male. Fifteen percent (8/54) were not cirrhotic. 11%, 24% and 50% had a BMI of <25 kg/, 25-29 kg/ and ≥30 kg/ respectively. Fifty-nine percent were diabetic, 44% hypertensive and 26% hyperlipidaemic. Thirty-four percent of the patients had ≤1 of these risk factors. Non-cirrhotics had a significantly larger mean tumour diameter at diagnosis than cirrhotics (P=0.041). Multivariate analysis did not identify any other patient characteristics that predicted the size or number of HCC.HCC can develop in NAFLD without cirrhosis. At diagnosis such tumours are larger than those in cirrhotics, conferring a poorer prognosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30540086>CORRELATION BETWEEN NONALCOHOLIC  DISEASE FEATURES AND LEVELS OF ADIPOKINES AND INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES AMONG MORBIDLY OBESE INDIVIDUALS.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the commonest hepatopathy worldwide.To investigate the correlations between NAFLD histopathological features and the levels of adipokines (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) and circulating inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-8 [IL-8], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and C-reactive protein [CRP]).This is an exploratory cross-sectional study, which enrolled 19 women with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery. Biochemical characteristics evaluated included the levels of adiponectin, leptin, resistin, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and CRP. NAFLD was assessed through histological examination of  biopsies carried out during the surgical procedures.The mean age of the study group was 37.3±8.2 years old; mean BMI was 36.2±2.5 kg/. Among individuals with  fibrosis, the levels of IL-8 were significantly higher (24.4 ± 9.7 versus 12.7 ± 6.6; P=0.016726). The intensity of fibrosis presented a significant negative correlation with the levels of adiponectin (R= -0.49379; P=0.03166); i.e. the higher the levels of adiponectin, the lower the intensity of fibrosis. The intensity of steatohepatitis presented a significant negative correlation with the levels of adiponectin (R= -0.562321; P=0.01221); this means that the higher the levels of adiponectin, the lower the intensity of steatohepatitis.Adiponectin levels were inversely correlated with the severity of fibrosis and steatohepatitis, whereas IL-8 levels were higher in individuals with  fibrosis among individuals with obesity and NAFLD undergoing bariatric surgery. The use of these markers to assess NAFLD may bring significant information within similar populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30001365>Association of inflammatory genes in obstructive sleep apnea and non alcoholic  disease in Asian Indians residing in north India.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have indicated that variants of the high sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin (IL)-6 and leptin receptor (LEPR) genes are associated with the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) but not in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in Asian Indians. The study was conducted to investigate the association of CRP rs1130864 (1444C/T), IL-6 rs1800795 (-174G/C) and LEPR rs1137101 (Q223R) genes with OSA and NAFLD in Asian Indians residing in North India.240 overweight/ obese subjects [body mass index (BMI>23kg/)], 124 with OSA and with NAFLD (group 1), 47 with OSA without NAFLD (group 2), 44 without OSA and with NAFLD (group 3) and 25 without OSA and without NAFLD (group 4) were recruited in this study. The severity of NAFLD was based on abdomen  ultrasound and of OSA on overnight polysomnography. Clinical details, anthropometry profile, body composition, biochemical parameters and inflammatory markers were measured. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism of CRP, IL-6 and LEPR gene was performed. The associations of these polymorphisms with clinical, anthropometric and biochemical profiles were investigated. The genotypes were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis.The C, T and R alleles of IL-6, CRP and LEPR genes was more frequent in OSA and NAFLD subjects and significantly correlated with higher protein levels. The prevalence of variant genotypes C/T of CRP, G/C of IL-6 and Q/R of LEPR genes was significantly higher in OSA subjects as compared to non OSA subjects. Further, C/C genotype of IL-6 (G/C), T/T of CRP (C/T) and RR genotype of LEPR (Q/R) was associated with significantly higher BMI, fat mass (kg), % body fat, waist circumference, serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, alkaline phosphate, aspartate transaminase and fasting insulin levels in OSA and NAFLD subjects. Using a multivariate analysis, the combined effect of three polymorphisms of CRP, IL-6 and LEPR gene variants on OSA and NAFLD risk was evaluated. Odds ratio for OSA and NAFLD with the combination of the three gene polymorphisms increased to 2.84 (95% CI: 1.08-6.54; p = 0.04) even when adjusted for sex, age and BMI.Polymorphisms of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes were associated with increased risk of OSA and NAFLD in Asian Indians.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28076416>The CCR2 Inhibitor Propagermanium Attenuates Diet-Induced Insulin Resistance, Adipose Tissue Inflammation and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Obese patients with chronic inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT) have an increased risk of developing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The C-C chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) has a crucial role in the recruitment of immune cells to WAT and , thereby promoting the inflammatory component of the disease. Herein, we examined whether intervention with propagermanium, an inhibitor of CCR2, would attenuate tissue inflammation and NASH development.Male C57BL/6J mice received a high-fat diet (HFD) for 0, 6, 12 and 24 weeks to characterize the development of early disease symptoms of NASH, i.e. insulin resistance and WAT inflammation (by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and histology, respectively) and to define the optimal time point for intervention. In a separate study, mice were pretreated with HFD followed by propagermanium treatment (0.05% w/w) after 6 weeks (early intervention) or 12 weeks (late intervention). NASH was analyzed after 24 weeks of diet feeding.Insulin resistance in WAT developed after 6 weeks of HFD, which was paralleled by modest WAT inflammation. Insulin resistance and inflammation in WAT intensified after 12 weeks of HFD, and preceded NASH development. The subsequent CCR2 intervention experiment showed that early, but not late, propagermanium treatment attenuated insulin resistance. Only the early treatment significantly decreased Mcp-1 and CD11c gene expression in WAT, indicating reduced WAT inflammation. Histopathological analysis of  demonstrated that propagermanium treatment decreased macrovesicular steatosis and tended to reduce lobular inflammation, with more pronounced effects in the early intervention group. Propagermanium improved the ratio between pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory () macrophages, quantified by CD11c and Arginase-1 gene expression in both intervention groups.Overall, early propagermanium administration was more effective to improve insulin resistance, WAT inflammation and NASH compared to late intervention. These data suggest that therapeutic interventions for NASH directed at the MCP-1/CCR2 pathway should be initiated early.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30835899>Iron alters macrophage polarization status and leads to steatohepatitis and fibrogenesis.</a></h2><p>We have previously demonstrated that iron overload in hepatic reticuloendothelial system cells (RES) is associated with severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and advanced fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Recruited myeloid-derived macrophages have gained a pivotal position as drivers of NASH progression and fibrosis. In this study, we used bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from C57Bl6 mice as surrogates for recruited macrophages and examined the effect of iron on macrophage polarization. Treatment with iron (ferric ammonium citrate, FAC) led to increased expression levels of M1 markers: CCL2, CD14, iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α; it also increased protein levels of CD68, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 by flow cytometry. This effect could be reversed by desferrioxamine, an iron chelator. Furthermore, iron loading of macrophages in the presence of IL-4 led to the down-regulation of  markers: arginase-1, Mgl-1, and -specific transcriptional regulator, KLF4. Iron loading of macrophages with IL-4 also resulted in reduced phosphorylation of STAT6, another transcriptional regulator of  activation. Dietary iron overload of C57Bl6 mice led to hepatic macrophage M1 activation. Iron overload also stimulated hepatic fibrogenesis. Histologic analysis revealed that iron overload resulted in steatohepatitis. Furthermore, NAFLD patients with hepatic RES iron deposition had increased hepatic gene expression levels of M1 markers, IL-6, IL-1β, and CD40 and reduced gene expression of an  marker, TGM2, relative to patients with hepatocellular iron deposition pattern. We conclude that iron disrupts the balance between M1/ macrophage polarization and leads to macrophage-driven inflammation and fibrogenesis in NAFLD.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28412824>Assessment of Lean Patients with Non-alcoholic  Disease in a Middle Income Country; Prevalence and Its Association with Metabolic Disorders: A Cross-sectional Study.</a></h2><p>Recent data has proven that the WHO (world health organization) cut-off for obesity is not applicable to the Asian population. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of lean NAFLD (non-alcoholic  disease) in the capital of Iran and extract probable predictors for this growing health issue in this population.This is a population-based cross-sectional study on apparently healthy subjects over 18 years of age. The participants were interviewed for baseline demographic and clinical information. They were subsequently referred for physical examination and blood sampling. NAFLD was diagnosed using abdominal ultrasonography by a single expert radiologist.Of 927 eligible participants who entered the study, 314 were lean; BMI (body mass index) <25 kg/. The prevalence of NAFLD was 17.52% (95% Exact CI: 13.48%-22.18%). BMI, SBP (systolic blood pressure), DBP (diastolic blood pressure), total cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and triglyceride were significantly different in patients with NAFLD. In the final multiple analysis, higher levels of triglyceride, upper SBP and higher BMI even in the range of less than 25 kg/ were independent predictors of NAFLD in lean participants. In lean participants with more components of metabolic syndrome, the prevalence of NAFLD increased significantly (all P < 0.01). BMI cut-offs in men and women along with waist circumference cut-off in men could significantly predict the presence of NAFLD in lean patients. After comparing these values, McNemar test showed that BMI cut-offs are more robust than waist circumference cut-offs for predicting the presence of NAFLD in lean subjects (P < 0.01).The prevalence of NAFLD in lean subjects in a sample of Iranian population is 17.52%. Hypertriglyceridemia, higher SBP, and higher BMI especially over 23.2 are independent factors associated with the presence of NAFLD in lean subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30365498>Proteome and microbiota analysis reveals alterations of -gut axis under different stocking density of Peking ducks.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine the impact of stocking density on the  proteome and cecal microbiota of Peking ducks. A total of 1,200 21-day-old ducks were randomly assigned to 5 stocking density groups of 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 ducks/, with 6 replicates for each group. At 40 days of age, duck serum and pectorals were collected for biochemical tests;  and cecal contents of ducks were gathered for proteome and microbiota analysis, respectively. Serum MDA increased while pectorals T-AOC reduced linearly with enhancing stocking density. Duck lipid metabolism was altered under different stocking density as well. Serum LDL-C increased linearly with increasing stocking density. Proteome analysis revealed  acid biosynthesis proteins such as acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2 and  acid oxidation related proteins including acyl-CoA dehydrogenase long chain and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase were enriched in high stocking density group. Additionally, high stocking density increased oxidative response associated proteins such as DDRGK domain containing 1. Furthermore, increasing stocking density diminished proteins of anti-oxidant capacity including regucalcin and catalase. 16S rDNA analysis revealed that higher stocking density was accompanied with decreased microbial diversity, as well as depletion of anti-inflammatory bacterial taxa, including Bacteroidales, Butyricimonas and Alistipe. Besides, reduced bile acid metabolism-associated bacteria such as Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales and Desulfovibrionaceae were found in the high-density group. Both proteome and 16S rDNA results showed inflammation and chronic  disease trend in the high-density group, which suggests the involvement of the -gut axis in oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25972231>Oncostatin M is a potential agent for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders: a study in mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity and insulin resistance are closely associated with adipose tissue dysfunction caused by the abnormal recruitment of inflammatory cells, including macrophages. Oncostatin M (OSM), a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines, plays important roles in a variety of biological functions including the regulation of inflammatory responses. In previous reports, we have demonstrated that mice deficient in the OSM receptor β subunit show obesity, adipose tissue inflammation, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, all of which are exacerbated by feeding the mice a high-fat diet. These results prompted us to test the therapeutic effects of OSM on obesity-induced metabolic disorders using mouse models of obesity.In diet-induced obese and ob/ob mice, metabolic variables were assessed physiologically, histologically and biochemically after the intraperitoneal injection of recombinant mouse OSM twice a day for 1 week.Treatment with OSM improved obesity, adipose tissue inflammation, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in both mouse models. Although OSM reduced food intake, such therapeutic effects of OSM were observed even under pair-feeding conditions. Functionally, OSM directly changed the phenotype of adipose tissue macrophages from M1 type (inflammatory) to  type (anti-inflammatory). In the , OSM suppressed the expression of genes related to  acid synthesis and increased the expression of genes related to  acid oxidation. Furthermore, OSM decreased lipid absorption and increased the expression of active glucagon-like peptide-1 in the intestine.We showed that OSM is a novel candidate to act as a powerful therapeutic agent for the treatment of obesity-induced metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29590715>Nutritional Status and Nutrition Quality in Patients with Non-Alcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is becoming a major health burden with increasing prevalence worldwide due to its close association with the epidemic of obesity. Currently there is no standardized pharmacological treatment, and the only proven effective therapeutic strategy is lifestyle modification, therefore it is important to determine the potential dietary targets for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. We assessed nutritional status in 30 patients diagnosed with NAFLD using anthropometric parameters, hand grip strength, and lifestyle and dietetic parameters (physical activity, NRS2002 form and three-day food diary). The mean body mass index was 29.62±4.61 kg/, yielding 86.67% of obese or overweight patients. Physical activity results indicat-ed poorly active subjects. Excessive energy intake was recorded in 27.78% of patients. The mean in-take of macronutrients was as follows: 15.5% of proteins, 42.3% of carbohydrates and 42.2% of fat, with -deficient micronutrient intake of calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and vitamins A, B1 and B2. The -results showed that the quality of nutrition in study subjects was not accordant to current rec-ommendations and that they consumed a high proportion of fat, especially saturated  acids, along with low micronutrient intake.

Recently, the -derived plasma protein, histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), was demonstrated, in mouse tumor models, to mediate the transition of alternatively activated () to proinflammatory (M1) macrophages, which limit tumor growth and metastasis. We hypothesized that -derived HRG is a critical endogenous modulator of hepatic macrophage functionality and investigated its implications for  inflammation and fibrosis by comparing C57BL/6N wild-type (WT) and Hrg(-/-) mice. In homeostatic conditions, hepatic macrophages were overall reduced and preferentially polarized toward the anti-inflammatory  subtype in Hrg(-/-) mice. Upon chronic  damage induced by CCl4 or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet,  injury and fibrosis were attenuated in Hrg(-/-) , compared to WT, mice. Macrophage populations were reduced and skewed toward  polarization in injured livers of Hrg(-/-) mice. Moreover, HRG-deficient mice showed significantly enhanced hepatic vascularization by micro-computed tomography and histology, corroborating proangiogenic activities of -polarized  macrophages. Purified HRG protein induced, but HRG-deficient serum prevented, M1 macrophage differentiation in vitro. Accordingly, Hrg(-/-) mice transplanted with Hrg(+/+) bone marrow, but not Hrg(-/-) -transplanted Hrg(+/+) mice, remained protected from experimental steatohepatitis. Consistent with these findings, patients with chronic hepatitis C and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis significantly up-regulated hepatocytic HRG expression, which was associated with M1 polarization of adjacent macrophages.-derived HRG, similar to alarmins, appears to be an endogenous molecular factor promoting polarization of hepatic macrophages toward the M1 phenotype, thereby promoting chronic  injury and fibrosis progression, but limiting angiogenesis. Therefore, controlling tissue levels of HRG or PGF might be a promising strategy in chronic inflammatory  diseases.© 2015 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29473277>Formation of p62-positive inclusion body is associated with macrophage polarization in non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Hepatic inclusion composed of autophagy-specific substrate p62 is one of the histological features of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and can be a precursor to hepatic carcinogenesis. The expression of p62 was enhanced by not only autophagic dysfunction but also oxidative stress and inflammation. M1/ phenotypic balance of macrophages plays a pivotal role in the progression of NAFLD. We evaluated the correlation between macrophage polarization and the formation of p62 aggregation in NAFLD. biopsy specimens from NAFLD patients were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining for M1 macrophage marker CD11c,  macrophage marker CD163, and p62/SQSTM1 (p62). The histological severity of NAFLD is assessed by a NAFLD activity score (NAS). The number of autophagic vesicles in hepatocytes was visualized and counted by using transmission electron microscopy.The aggregation of p62 was undetectable in control, whereas hepatocytes with p62 aggregation were observed in approximately 88% of NAFLD specimens. The number of hepatocytes with p62 aggregation was positively correlated with the number of autophagic vesicles, serum alanine aminotransferase, NAS, fibrosis, and the number of CD11c-positive cells, but not CD163-positive cells. Assembly of CD11c-positive cells was observed around hepatocytes with p62 aggregation. The ratio of CD11c/CD163-positive macrophages was significantly associated with the formation of p62 aggregation.These findings indicate that chronic inflammation by M1-polarization of macrophages contributes to the disease progression from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in concert with autophagic dysfunction.© 2018 The Japan Society of Hepatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30183204>Rapidly progressive non-alcoholic  disease due to hypopituitarism.

While multiple 'hits' have been reported to contribute to NAFLD progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and  cancer, understanding the natural history of the specific molecular signals leading to hepatocyte damage, inflammation and fibrosis, is hampered by the lack of suitable animal models that reproduce disease progression in humans. The purpose of this study was first, to develop a mouse model that closely mimics progressive NAFLD covering the spectrum of immune, metabolic and histopathologic abnormalities present in human disease; and second, to characterize the temporal relationship between sterile/exogenous danger signals, inflammation, inflammasome activation and NAFLD progression.Male C57Bl/6 mice were fed a high fat diet with high cholesterol and a high sugar supplement (HF-HC-HSD) for 8, 27, and 49 weeks and the extent of steatosis,  inflammation, fibrosis and tumor development were evaluated at each time point.The HF-HC-HSD resulted in  steatosis at 8 weeks, progressing to steatohepatitis and early fibrosis at 27 weeks, and steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and tumor development at 49 weeks compared to chow diet. Steatohepatitis was characterized by increased levels of MCP-1, TNFα, IL-1β and increased  NASH histological score. We found increased serum levels of sterile danger signals, uric acid and HMGB1, as early as 8 weeks, while endotoxin and ATP levels increased only after 49 weeks. Increased levels of these sterile and microbial danger signals paralleled upregulation and activation of the multiprotein complex inflammasome. At 27, 49 weeks of HF-HC-HSD, activation of M1 macrophages and loss of  macrophages as well as  fibrosis were present. Finally, similar to human NASH,  tumors occurred in 41% of mice in the absence of cirrhosis and livers expressed increased p53 and detectable AFP.HF-HC-HSD over 49 weeks induces the full spectrum of  pathophysiologic changes that characterizes the progression of NAFLD in humans.

Subjects' mortality rate during the follow-up period was 1.94%, 2.23% in the NAFLD group, and 1.89% in the control group. Average life expectancy was 75.58 years in NAFLD group and 78.68 years in the control group. All deaths in NAFLD groups were associated with MS, and 70.83% combined with three or more MS. The primary cause of death in NAFLD group was tumors (37.5%), followed by cardiovascular disease (16.67%) and three cases died directly from MS.  The prevalence of NAFLD in the elderly population in Kunshan city, Jiangsu province is relatively low, which may be associated with local diet and high-intensity workouts. MS disorders represented by obesity and diabetes mellitus are closely associated to the onset of NAFLD. Obesity is the most important risk factor for the incidence of NAFLD in the local elderly population over 60 years old. However, the risk of NAFLD should not be neglected in people with normal BMI, especially in aged women, and the weight control should be the most important means to prevent and control NAFLD. NAFLD may increase mortality rate and reduce life expectancy in the elderly population. The main reason to cause death in the elderly with NAFLD is cardiovascular disease and malignant tumors. Simultaneously, multiple MS development may increase the death rate in elderly with NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29133512>Exosomes From Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Attenuate Adipose Inflammation and Obesity Through Polarizing  Macrophages and Beiging in White Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) play critical roles in controlling obesity-associated inflammation and metabolic disorders. Exosomes from ADSCs exert protective effects in several diseases, but their roles in obesity and related pathological conditions remain unclear. In this study, we showed that treatment of obese mice with ADSC-derived exosomes facilitated their metabolic homeostasis, including improved insulin sensitivity (27.8% improvement), reduced obesity, and alleviated hepatic steatosis. ADSC-derived exosomes drove alternatively activated  macrophage polarization, inflammation reduction, and beiging in white adipose tissue (WAT) of diet-induced obese mice. Mechanistically, exosomes from ADSCs transferred into macrophages to induce anti-inflammatory  phenotypes through the transactivation of arginase-1 by exosome-carried active STAT3. Moreover,  macrophages induced by ADSC-derived exosomes not only expressed high levels of tyrosine hydroxylase responsible for catecholamine release, but also promoted ADSC proliferation and lactate production, thereby favoring WAT beiging and homeostasis in response to high-fat challenge. These findings delineate a novel exosome-mediated mechanism for ADSC-macrophage cross talk that facilitates immune and metabolic homeostasis in WAT, thus providing potential therapy for obesity and diabetes.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28244120>The histone methyltransferase Suv39h2 contributes to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Uncontrolled inflammatory response highlights the central theme of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a growing global pandemic. Hepatocytes and macrophages represent two major sources of hepatic inflammation during NASH pathogenesis, contributing to excessive synthesis of proinflammatory mediators. The epigenetic mechanism that accounts for the activation of hepatocytes and macrophages in this process remains obscure. Here, we report that compared to wild-type littermates, mice with a deficiency in the histone H3K9 methyltransferase suppressor of variegation 39 homolog 2 (Suv39h2, knockout) exhibited a less severe form of NASH induced by feeding with a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. Pro-NASH stimuli increased Suv39h2 expression in cell culture, in mice, and in human livers. In hepatocytes, Suv39h2 bound to the Sirt1 gene promoter and repressed Sirt1 transcription. Suv39h2 deficiency normalized Sirt1 expression, allowing nuclear factor kappa B/p65 to become hypoacetylated and thus dampening nuclear factor kappa B-dependent transcription of proinflammatory mediators. In macrophages, Suv39h2-mediated repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma transcription favored a proinflammatory M1 phenotype over an anti-inflammatory  phenotype, thereby elevating hepatic inflammation.Suv39h2 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammatory response in hepatocytes and macrophages, contributing to NASH pathogenesis.

In this study, we describe the in vivo role of miR-155 in ALD.Wild-type (WT) (C57/BL6J) or miR-155 knockout (KO) and TLR4 KO mice received Lieber DeCarli diet for 5weeks. Some mice received corn oil or CCl4 for 2 or 9weeks.We found that miR-155 KO mice are protected from alcohol-induced steatosis and inflammation. The reduction in alcohol-induced fat accumulation in miR-155 KO mice was associated with increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)α (miR-155 target) binding and decreased MCP1 production. Treatment with a miR-155 inhibitor increased PPARγ expression in naïve and alcohol treated RAW macrophages. Alcohol increased lipid metabolism gene expression (FABP4, LXRα, ACC1 and LDLR) in WT mice and this was prevented in KO mice. Alcohol diet caused an increase in the number of CD163(+) CD206(+) infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils in WT mice, which was prevented in miR-155 KO mice. Kupffer cells isolated from miR-155 KO mice exhibited predominance of  phenotype when exposed to M1 polarized signals and this was due to increased C/EBPβ. Pro-fibrotic genes were attenuated in miR-155 KO mice after alcohol diet or CCl4 treatment. Compared to WT mice, attenuation in CCl4 induced hydroxyproline and α-SMA was observed in KO mice. Finally, we show TLR4 signaling regulates miR-155 as TLR4 KO mice showed no induction of miR-155 after alcohol diet.Collectively our results demonstrated the role of miR-155 in alcohol-induced steatohepatitis and fibrosis in vivo.Copyright © 2016 European Association for the Study of the .

Clinical studies have demonstrated an association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and both inflammation and fibrosis in NASH, but the mechanism has not been identified. In this study, we use  modeling to examine the impact of intermittent hypoxia on the . Hepatocyte, stellate cell, and macrophage cell lines were exposed to intermittent or sustained hypoxia. Candidate genes associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and lipogenesis were analyzed. Circulating cytokines were assessed in human serum of patients with nonalcoholic  disease. Intermittent hypoxia results in significant induction of interleukin (IL)-6 expression in both hepatocytes and macrophages. The increase in IL-6 expression was independent of hypoxia inducible factor 1 induction but appeared to be in part related to antioxidant response element and nuclear factor kappa B activation. Mature microRNA 365 (miR-365) has been demonstrated to regulate IL-6 expression, and we found that miR-365 expression was decreased in the setting of intermittent hypoxia. Furthermore, macrophage cell lines showed polarization to an M1 but not  phenotype. Finally, we found a trend toward higher circulating levels of IL-6 in patients with OSA and NASH. : Intermittent hypoxia acts as a potent proinflammatory stimulus, resulting in IL-6 induction and M1 macrophage polarization. Increased IL-6 expression may be due to both induction of antioxidant response element and nuclear factor kappa B as well as inhibition of miR-365 expression. Higher levels of IL-6 were observed in human samples of patients with OSA and NASH. These findings provide biological insight into mechanisms by which obstructive sleep apnea potentiates inflammation and fibrosis in patients with  disease.

In this study, we hypothesized that DWJ504, an extract of O ficus-indica seed, would ameliorate hepatic steatosis and inflammation by regulating hepatic de novo lipogenesis and macrophage polarization against experimental nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Mice were fed a normal diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. DWJ504 (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose) were orally administered for the last 4 weeks of the 10-week HFD feeding period. DWJ504 treatment remarkably attenuated HFD-induced increases in hepatic lipid content and hepatocellular damage. DWJ504 attenuated increases in sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein expression and a decrease in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A. Although DWJ504 augmented peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α protein expression, it attenuated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression. Moreover, DWJ504 promoted hepatic  macrophage polarization as indicated by attenuation of the M1 marker genes and enhancement of  marker genes. Finally, DWJ504 attenuated expression of toll-like receptor 4, nuclear factor κB, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 6, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon β, and interferon β levels. Our results demonstrate that DWJ504 prevented intrahepatic lipid accumulation, induced  macrophage polarization, and suppressed the toll-like receptor 4-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway. Thus, DWJ504 has therapeutic potential in the prevention of nonalcoholic  disease.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The association of NAFLD with outcomes in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has been variably reported. This study aimed to investigate the association of NAFLD with cardiovascular, renal outcomes and mortality in patients with advanced DKD (CKD 3-5, not on dialysis).This observational study was carried out on 192 patients with DKD within a cohort of 2,974 non-dialysis CKD patients, who had an ultrasound (US) of their  done between January 2000 and end of December 2014. From these 192 patients, 149 patients (NAFLD 48 and normal US 101) were included for comparative analysis, as they had complete datasets. Patient demographics, comorbidities and blood results were collected at study baseline. Follow-up data on non-fatal cardiovascular events (NFCVE), mortality and serial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was gathered until study end point. Cox-regression analysis was used to study the association of NAFLD with NFCVE and mortality, and linear regression analysis was used for the estimation of renal progression.Median follow-up time was 69 months, similar in both groups (p = 0.09). Median eGFR was 31.6 mL/min/1.73 , with a median urine protein creatinine ratio of 46 g/mol. A total of 20 (41.7%) NFCVE were recorded in the NAFLD group compared to 14 (13.9%) in the normal US group. Multivariable Cox-regression analysis showed NAFLD as an independent risk factor (hazard ratio 2.95; 95% CI 1.31-6.60; p = 0.01) for NFCVE even after including all cardiovascular risks parameters that were significant in the univariable model. There was no significant difference in survival between the 2 groups over the follow-up period (log-rank test, p = 0.76). The overall rate of decline in eGFR was 3.46 mL/min/1.73 /year and this was not observed to be different between the groups (p = 0.65).In our cohort of patients with advanced DKD, NAFLD showed a strong independent association with cardiovascular outcomes.

The present study was conducted to investigate transcriptomic responses in the  and jejunal mucosa of pigs to evaluate the effects of different feeding frequencies on the body's metabolism. Twelve Duroc × Landrance × Yorkshire growing pigs with an average initial weight (IW) of 14.86 ± 0.20 kg were randomly assigned to two groups: feeding one time per day (M1) and feeding two times per day (); each group consisted of six replicates (pens), with one pig per pen. During the one-month experimental period, pigs in the M1 group were fed on an ad libitum basis at 8:00 am; and the  group was fed half of the standard feeding requirement at 8:00 am and adequate feed at 16:00 pm. The results showed that average daily feed intake, average daily gain, feed:gain, and the organ indices were not significantly different between the two groups ( > 0.05).

We conducted a pooled analysis of individual participant data from published studies to compare the diagnostic performance of MRE vs TE for staging of  fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, using  biopsy as reference.We performed a systematic search of publication databases, from 2005 through 2017. We identified 3 studies of adults with NAFLD who were assessed by MRE, TE, and  biopsy. In a pooled analysis, we calculated the cluster-adjusted area under the curve (AUROC) of MRE and TE for the detection of each stage of fibrosis. AUROC comparisons between MRE and TE were performed using the Delong test.Our pooled analysis included 230 participants with biopsy-proven NAFLD with mean age of 52.2±13.9 years and a body mass index of 31.9±7.5 kg/. The proportions of patients with fibrosis of stages 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were: 31.7%, 27.8%, 15.7%, 13.9%, and 10.9%, respectively.

Macrophage-mediated inflammation plays a critical role in NASH pathogenesis; however, optimum therapies for macrophage activation and NASH remain elusive. HSPA12A encodes a novel member of the HSP70 family. Here, we report that NASH patients showed increased hepatic HSPA12A expression and serum HSPA12A contents. Intriguingly, knockout of HSPA12A ( ) in mice attenuated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis and injury. HFD-induced macrophage polarization toward an M1 phenotype and inflammatory responses in the  of  mice were also attenuated. Loss- and gain-of-function studies revealed that the de novo lipogenesis in hepatocytes was regulated by the paracrine effects of macrophage HSPA12A rather than by hepatocyte HSPA12A. In-depth molecular analysis revealed that HSPA12A interacted with the  isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) in macrophages and increased its nuclear translocation, thereby promoting M1 polarization and secretion of proinflammatory M1 cytokines; this led, ultimately, to hepatocyte steatosis via paracrine effects. Taken together, these findings show that HSPA12A acts as a novel regulator of M1 macrophage polarization and NASH pathogenesis by increasing nuclear PKM2. Strategies that inhibit macrophage HSPA12A might be a potential therapeutic intervention for NASH.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30248395>Pharmacokinetic changes of tramadol in rats with hepatotoxicity induced by ethanol and acetaminophen in perfused rat  model.</a></h2><p>Tramadol is an opioid agonist with activation monoaminergic properties. It can be administered orally, rectally, intravenously, or intramuscularly as a centrally acting analgesic.  injury can lead to changes in the metabolism of tramadol. In this study, the rate of tramadol metabolism in rats with damaged  induced by ethanol and acetaminophen was assessed in a recirculation perfusion system. Acetaminophen is a mild analgesic and antipyretic agent, which can cause centrilobular hepatic necrosis in toxic doses, whereas alcohol causes death due to  diseases. Alcoholic  disease (ALD), such as alcoholic , alcoholic hepatitis, and alcoholic fibrosis, is the most common  disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the alteration in tramadol metabolism in different hepatotoxicity conditions in animal models. Male rats were randomly assigned to three groups. The control group received normal saline, group 2 received acetaminophen at the dose of 250 mg/kg/day, and group 3 received ethanol at the beginning dose of 3 g/kg/day, which was slowly increased to 6 g/kg/day. Tramadol was added to the perfusion solution at the concentration of 500 ng/mL. Samples were collected during 180 min, and analyte concentrations were determined by the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method. The concentration of tramadol and its three main metabolites, O-desmethyltramadol (M1), N-desmethyltramadol (), and N,O-didesmethyltramadol (M5), were determined in perfusate samples. Ethanol and acetaminophen significantly affected the pattern of weight gain and  weights before perfusion and caused a significant increase in enzyme activities. Moreover, histopathologic examination revealed that ethanol and acetaminophen caused  damage. An increase in the elimination half-life and reduced clearance rate of tramadol were seen in the acetaminophen and ethanol groups, in comparison to the control group. Additionally, significant reductions in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of metabolites of tramadol (M1, , and M5) were observed in the acetaminophen and ethanol groups in the perfused rat  model.  damage caused by ethanol and acetaminophen during 45 days in animals leads to a significant reduction in the level of tramadol metabolites. Therefore, in patients with  damage caused by ethanol and acetaminophen, caution needs to be considered when prescribing tramadol.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Immune molecules, including some cytokines, have a close relationship with metabolism. Interleukin (IL)-25 is a member of the IL-17 cytokine family that can regulate macrophages and alleviate some metabolic dysfunction; however, its role and mechanisms in lipid metabolism remain to be extensively clarified. Human serum and  biopsy specimens, high-fat diet-induced obesity mice and DB/DB (Lepr-/-) animal models were used to examine IL-25 expression in obesity and nonalcoholic  diseases (NAFLD). To observe the role of IL-25 in lipid metabolism, model mice were administered with IL-25 or adoptively transferred with IL-25-educated macrophages in vivo, whereas bone marrow-derived macrophages, the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and adipocytes differentiated from 3T3-L1 were used in vitro. IL-25 was decreased in NAFLD patients and obese mice. In addition, IL-25 reduced body weight gain and lipid accumulation, enhanced lipid uptake by macrophages and increased the expression of lipolysis and β-oxidation enzymes via alternatively activating macrophages. IL-25 also promoted lipolysis and suppressed lipogenesis in adipocytes co-cultured with the IL-25-educated macrophages. Furthermore, IL-25 improved the mitochondrial respiratory capacity and oxygen consumption rate of macrophages and produced more NAD/NADH and ATP. In conclusion, IL-25 can stimulate  macrophage polarization and thereby promote lipolysis and mitochondrial respiratory capacity, highlighting the potential for IL-25 to be used as a therapeutic agent against obesity and associated metabolic syndromes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142104>Effects of different exercise modalities on novel hepatic steatosis indices in overweight women with type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p> is a clinical and pathologic condition in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Here, we describe the orphan nuclear receptor retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) as a key regulator of M1/ polarization in hepatic residential Kupffer cells (KCs) and infiltrated monocyte-derived macrophages. RORα enhanced  polarization in KCs by inducing the kruppel-like factor 4.  polarization was defective in KCs and bone-marrow-derived macrophages of the myeloid-specific RORα null mice, and these mice were susceptible to HFD-induced NASH. We found that IL-10 played an important role in connecting the function of  KCs to lipid accumulation and apoptosis in hepatocytes. Importantly,  polarization was controlled by a RORα activator, JC1-40, which improved symptoms of NASH. Our results suggest that the -promoting effects of RORα in  macrophages may provide better therapeutic strategies against NASH.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

As one of the three ER membrane resident proteins, pancreatic eIF-2alpha kinase (PERK) plays an important role in ER stress, but its participation in macrophage polarization is largely unknown. In this study, we found that the PA mediated ER-stress activation could induce M1-type polarization in macrophages, and this phenotype polarization could be inhibited by ER-stress inhibitor 4-PBA as well as GSK2656157, an inhibitor of PERK. Moreover, the knockdown of PERK altered the STAT1 and STAT6 pathways in macrophages, which then led to the M1-to- phenotypic shift. In summary, we found that PERK could regulate the phenotypic polarization of macrophages.

This was a retrospective analysis of patients without history of  disease examined by abdominal US in the University hospital setting. US was used to detect and semiquantitatively grade (0-3)  steatosis. Data on patients' age, gender, body mass index (BMI), impaired glucose metabolism (IGM), atherogenic dyslipidaemia (AD), raised blood pressure (RBP), transaminases, and platelet counts were obtained from medical records. MS was defined as having at least 3 of the following components: obesity, IGM, AD, and RBP. Of the 631 patients (median age 60 years, median BMI 27.4 kg/, and 57.4% females) 71.5% were overweight and 48.5% had NAFL. In the subgroup of 159 patients with available data on the components of MS, patients with higher US grade of steatosis had significantly higher BMI and increased prevalence of obesity, IGM, AD, RBP, and accordingly more frequently had MS, whereas they did not differ in terms of age and gender. NAFL was independently associated with the risk of having MS in a multivariate model adjusted for age, gender, BMI, and IGM. The grade of  steatosis did not correlate with the presence of  fibrosis. We demonstrated worrisome prevalence of obesity and NAFL in the outpatient population from our geographic region.

Macrophage polarization is an important mechanism for the regulation of inflammatory response. Since PPAR-γ has emerged as a master regulator of macrophage polarization, we aimed to investigate the lipid-induced macrophage/Kupffer cell polarization in vivo and in vitro, and explore the association between PPAR-γ activity and macrophages M1/ polarization shifting. Here we showed that long-term high-fat diet increased Kupffer cells content with M1-predominant phenotype and increasing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Saturated  acids polarized Kupffer cells/macrophages to an M1-predominant phenotype while n-3 PUFA polarized Kupffer cells/macrophages to an  phenotype, which was associated with activation of NF-κB signal pathway and PPAR-γ respectively. Furthermore, up-regulation of PPAR-γ shifted lipid-induced macrophages polarization from M1-predominant phenotype to  phenotype. Macrophages polarization switch was associated with the interaction between PPAR-γ and NF-κBp65 signal pathway. Rosiglitazone restored high-fat diet-induced imblance of Kupffer cells M1/ polarization and alleviated hepatic steatosis as well as local pro-inflammatory response. These findings suggest that manipulation of PPAR-γ activity has the potential to balance lipid-induced M1/ macrophage/Kupffer cell polarization, and leading to prevent the development of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29093267>Loss of miR-141/200c ameliorates hepatic steatosis and inflammation by reprogramming multiple signaling pathways in NASH.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of lipid droplets and inflammatory cell infiltration is the hallmark of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The roles of noncoding RNAs in NASH are less known. We aim to elucidate the function of miR-141/200c in diet-induced NASH. WT and miR-141/200c-/- mice were fed a methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet for 2 weeks to assess markers of steatosis,  injury, and inflammation. Hepatic miR-141 and miR-200c RNA levels were highly induced in human patients with NASH  and in WT MCD mice. miR-141/200c-/- MCD mice had reduced  weights and triglyceride (TG) levels, which was associated with increased microsomal TG transfer protein (MTTP) and PPARα but reduced SREBP1c and FAS expression. Inflammation was attenuated and F4/80 macrophage activation was suppressed in miR-141/200c-/- mice, as evidenced by decreased serum aminotransferases and IL-6 and reduced hepatic proinflammatory, neutrophil, and profibrotic genes. Treatment with LPS in BM-derived macrophages isolated from miR-200c/141-/- mice polarized macrophages toward the  antiinflammatory state by increasing Arg1 and IL-10 levels while decreasing the M1 marker iNOS. In addition, elevated phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), p-AKT, and p-GSK3β and diminished TLR4 and p-mTOR/p-4EBP1 proteins were observed. Lipidomics and metabolomics revealed alterations of TG and phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid species by miR-141/200c deficiency. In summary, miR-141/200c deficiency diminished NASH-associated hepatic steatosis and inflammation by reprogramming lipid and inflammation signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28895584>Effects of lobeglitazone, a novel thiazolidinedione, on adipose tissue remodeling and brown and beige adipose tissue development in db/db mice.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of long-term treatment with lobeglitazone, a novel thiazolidinedione-based activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, on adipose tissue (AT), focusing on its effects on insulin resistance in obese db/db mice.Seven-week-old male db/db mice were assigned to either a vehicle-treated (n=8) or lobeglitazone-treated (n=8) group. Lobeglitazone (1 mg kg daily) was injected intraperitoneally for 20 weeks.Lobeglitazone treatment for 20 weeks resulted in a remarkably improved glycemic index, including significantly decreased glucose levels, enhanced insulin sensitivity and preserved pancreatic beta cells. Both whole body and subcutaneous AT weight increased in the lobeglitazone-treated group. However, lobeglitazone induced an increase in the number of small adipocyte in both epididymal and subcutaneous AT, with a significant weight decrease in the epididymal AT of db/db mice. Using flow cytometry, the CD11c-positive M1 macrophages and CD206-positive  macrophages in the epididymal AT were observed to exhibit a decreased M1-to- ratio in lobeglitazone-treated db/db mice. Furthermore, in the lobeglitazone-treated group, interscapular brown AT was clearly visualized by F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (F-FDG-PET/CT) and its mass was significantly greater than that of the vehicle-treated group. In the lobeglitazone-treated group, beige-specific gene expression and the number of mitochondria in white AT were upregulated. Lobeglitazone, with upregulating interferon regulatory factor-4 (a key transcriptional regulator of thermogenesis), promoted the development of brown adipocytes and the differentiation of white adipocytes into beige adipocytes.Long-term lobeglitazone treatment has a beneficial role in remodeling and ameliorating inflammation in white AT and in glycemic control, in relation to insulin sensitivity in obese db/db mice. Moreover, lobeglitazone induced the differentiation of brown and beige adipocytes. Collectively, our data suggest that lobeglitazone treatment provides promising effects on white and brown AT as well as great improvement in glycemic control, as a potent insulin sensitizer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30310658>Effects of exposure of adult mice to multi-walled carbon nanotubes on the  lipid metabolism of their offspring.</a></h2><p>: To explore the toxicity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the  lipid metabolism of offspring mice and the possible mechanisms involved. : Virgin female (16-18 g) and male (18-20 g) C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into two groups: Control group and Test group. After anesthesia with chloral hydrate, the mice were administered 50 μL saline or dust solution by intratracheal instillation (Control group: 50 μL saline; Test group: 15 mg kg MWCNTs). Mice were injected with these doses once a week for 13 weeks. Then, male and female mice in the same group were allowed to mate to produce offspring. The pups were fed with normal diet until the end of the experiment (12 weeks old). The offspring mice were sacrificed by decapitation to detect the blood biochemistry and the expression of genes and proteins. : Compared with the Control group, MWCNTs significantly reduced the weight of offspring mice (male and female) and led to histopathological changes in the  tissues. The expression of  fat synthesis gene significantly increased ( < 0.05 or  < 0.01). The expression of genes and proteins involved in the inflammatory reactions appeared to be abnormal ( < 0.05 or  < 0.01). : Exposure of adult mice to MWCNTs can affect the expression of  acid synthesis genes in the  tissues of offspring mice, leading to disruption of  function and accumulation of lipid droplets in the hepatocytes. The imbalance between M1 and   macrophage phenotypes may be one of the underlying mechanisms of action of MWCNTs leading to disordered  acid synthesis in offspring mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30949667>Consumption of Alcoholic and Sugar-Sweetened Beverages is Associated with Increased  Fat Content in Middle-Aged Men and Women.</a></h2><p> is the leading cause of chronic  diseases and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Besides alcohol consumption, energy-containing nonalcoholic beverages may contribute to  fat accumulation.We aimed to study the consumption of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and their mutual replacement in relation to hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC) in middle-aged men and women.In this cross-sectional analysis, HTGC was assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Habitual consumption of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages was assessed using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. All beverages were converted to standard servings and to percentage of total energy intake (En%). We performed linear regression to examine the association of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages with HTGC, adjusted for age, sex, smoking, education, ethnicity, physical activity, total energy intake, and total body fat. We studied replacement of alcoholic beverages with nonalcoholic beverages per 1 serving/d and per 5 En%/d.After exclusion of individuals with missing values, 1966 participants (47% men) were analyzed, with a mean ± SD age of 55 ± 6 y, BMI of 26 ± 4 kg/, and HTGC of 5.7% ± 7.9%. Each extra alcoholic serving per day was associated with more  fat (1.09 times; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.12). Replacing 5 En% of alcoholic beverages with milk was associated with less  fat (0.89 times; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), whereas replacement with 5 En% of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with  fat to an extent similar to alcoholic beverages (1.00 times; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.09).In a population-based cohort, consumption of each extra daily alcoholic beverage was associated with more  fat. In isocaloric replacement of alcoholic beverages, milk was associated with less  fat, whereas sugar-sweetened beverages were equally associated with  fat. This suggests that intake of alcohol and sugars may contribute to  fat accumulation.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at risk for developing end-stage  disease due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the aggressive form of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Data on prevalence of advanced fibrosis among T2DM patients is scarce.To evaluate prevalence of steatosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis using non-invasive methods in T2DM patients.145 consecutive T2DM patients (> 55 years-old) were prospectively recruited. Presence of cirrhosis and advanced fibrosis was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) respectively. Exclusion criteria included significant alcohol consumption, markers of viral hepatitis infection or other  diseases. Results are expressed in percentage or median (interquartile range).52.6% of patients were women, the median age was 60 years old (57-64), mean BMI was 29.6 ± 4.7 kg/ and diabetes duration was 7.6 ± 6.9 years. A high prevalence of  steatosis (63.9%), advanced fibrosis assessed by NFS (12.8%) and evidence of  cirrhosis in MRI (6.0%) was observed. In a multivariate analysis GGT > 82 IU/L (P = 0.004) and no alcohol intake (P = 0.032) were independently associated to advanced fibrosis.A high frequency of undiagnosed advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis was observed in non-selected T2DM patients.

This study aimed to investigate the association of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and hip-adjusted WC with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.50045 people aged 40-75 (58% women, median BMI: 26.3 kg / ) participated in the population-based Golestan Cohort Study. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association of obesity indicators with mortality. We also examined the association of these indicators with intermediate outcomes, including hypertension, blood glucose, dyslipidemia, carotid atherosclerosis, nonalcoholic , and visceral abdominal fat.After a median follow-up of 10.9 years (success rate: 99.1%), 6651 deaths (2778 cardiovascular) occurred. Comparing 5th to the 1st quintile, HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were 1.12 (1.02-1.22) and 1.59 (1.39-1.83) for BMI, 1.16 (1.07-1.27) and 1.66 (1.44-1.90) for WC, 1.28 (1.17-1.40) and 1.88 (1.63-2.18) for WHtR, 1.44 (1.32-1.58) and 2.04 (1.76-2.36) for WHR, and 1.84 (1.62-2.09) and 2.72 (2.23-3.32) for hip-adjusted WC, respectively. Hip-adjusted WC had the strongest associations with the intermediate outcomes.Indicators of visceral adiposity (e.g., hip-adjusted WC) were much stronger predictors of overall and cardiovascular mortality than were indicators of general adiposity (e.g., BMI). The full-strength effect of visceral adiposity becomes apparent only when both WC, as a risk factor, and hip circumference, as a protective factor, are individually and simultaneously taken into consideration.© 2019 The Author(s).

Demographics, body mass index (BMI), medical history, and laboratory parameters were compared for groups stratified by obesity (≥ 28 kg/) or CKD. An association between obesity and CKD was analyzed, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted for risk factors associated with CKD.In the overall population, 28.7% were obese and 54.8% had CKD; there were more women (58.8%) than men. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was similar between the obese and nonobese groups and between the CKD and non-CKD groups. Obese patients had significantly higher levels of serum uric acid and estimated glomerular filtration rates when compared with the nonobese group. When compared with those without CKD, patients with CKD were significantly older in addition to having higher BMI and serum uric acid levels. The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that CKD was positively associated with age, BMI, and serum uric acid levels.Elderly obese patients with NAFLD are at a higher risk of CKD. NAFLD patients with advanced age, greater BMI, or higher serum uric acid levels are more prone to developing CKD.

The enhanced  fibrosis test (ELF) based on the combination of serum concentration of hyaluronic acid (HA), aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase type 1 (TIMP-1) was developed as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for estimation of degree of  fibrosis. The aim of our study was to investigate the performance of ELF test in obese children with ultrasound-proven steatosis in order assess the possibility of early detection of fibrotic changes in  structure.58 obese (BMI >95th percentile) children, 27 male (mean age 13.9±2.65 years) and 31 female (mean age 13.82±2.64 years). Based on the  ultrasound (US) examination results two groups of obese children were studied: group with steatosis (N=20, 8/12 M/F, mean age 14.2±1.90 years, BMI 32.9±5.60 kg/) and group with normal  US (n=38, 19/19 M/F, mean age 13.7±2.94 years, BMI 30.4±4.67 kg/). Serum activity of aminotransferases (AST, ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and ELF test (HA, PIIINP, and TIMP-1 were analyzed.Children with  steatosis presented with significantly higher AST (34.1 vs. 25.6 U/L), ALT (43.4 vs. 32 U/L), LDH (427.5 vs. 361.3 U/L), GGT (30.7 vs. 18.9 U/L). The ELF test value was also significantly higher in that group (8.98 vs. 8.49). Nevertheless no combination of measured parameters with ELF test value show better diagnostic value for differentiation between children with and without steaotosis.ELF test cannot be used for assessment of steatosis in obese children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28241076>Characterisation of  fat in the UK Biobank cohort.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease and the risk of progression to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma have been identified as major public health concerns. We have demonstrated the feasibility and potential value of measuring  fat content by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a large population in this study of 4,949 participants (aged 45-73 years) in the UK Biobank imaging enhancement. Despite requirements for only a single (≤3min) scan of each subject,  fat was able to be measured as the MRI proton density fat fraction (PDFF) with an overall success rate of 96.4%. The overall hepatic fat distribution was centred between 1-2%, and was highly skewed towards higher fat content. The mean PDFF was 3.91%, and median 2.11%. Analysis of PDFF in conjunction with other data fields available from the UK Biobank Resource showed associations of increased  fat with greater age, BMI, weight gain, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes. Subjects with BMI less than 25 kg/ had a low risk (5%) of high  fat (PDFF > 5.5%), whereas in the higher BMI population (>30 kg/) the prevalence of high  fat was approximately 1 in 3. These data suggest that population screening to identify people with high PDFF is possible and could be cost effective. MRI based PDFF is an effective method for this. Finally, although cross sectional, this study suggests the utility of the PDFF measurement within UK Biobank, particularly for applications to elucidating risk factors through associations with prospectively acquired data on clinical outcomes of  diseases, including non-alcoholic  disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669784>[Interleukin-17-mediated inflammation promotes nonalcoholic  disease in mice with regulation of M1-type macrophage polarization].</a></h2><p> To study the mechanism of interleukin (IL)-17 in mice with non-alcoholic  disease for promoting M1-type macrophage polarization to exacerbate  inflammation, and to provide references for the mechanism of NAFLD occurrence and development.  A mouse model of NAFLD was constructed by high-fat diet. Mice were divided into control group, model group, IL-17 group, and anti IL-17 group. Histopathological changes of the  were observed by HE staining. The serum levels of ALT and AST in peripheral blood of mice was detected by chemical colorimetry. Macrophages labeled with F4/80-PE, CD11C-FITC was designated as M1-type macrophages, those labeled with F4/80-PE, and CD206-APC was designated as -type macrophages. The proportion of M1 and  macrophages infiltrated into the  tissues of mice were measured by flow cytometry. CD168 expression level of  tissues was detected using immunohistochemistry. Protein and mRNA levels of the marker molecules (iNOS, TNF-alpha and IL-6) of M1 macrophages were detected using ELISA and RT-Q PCR. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of JAK-STAT signal pathway and the expression level of MCP-1. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and t-test.  High-fat diet NAFLD mice model was successfully constructed. IL-17 had increased the proportion of M1 macrophages in mice  tissues and decreased the proportion of  macrophages ( < 0.05). The proportion of M1 and  macrophages in the  tissues of normal mice was 7.9% ± 1.1% and 19.2% ± 1.8%. The proportion of M1 and  macrophages in the model group was 17.3% ± 2.5% and 15.0% ± 2.1. The proportion of M1 macrophages (33.8% ± 4.2%) in IL-17 group was higher than model group, while the proportion of  macrophages (7.8% + 1.0%) in IL-17 group was lower than model group. Protein and mRNA marker levels of M1 macrophage (iNOS, IL-12, TNFα and IL-6) in  tissues were significantly higher than model group, control group, and anti-IL-17 group ( < 0.05). The expression levels of JAK1, STAT1, MCP-1, and CD168 in mice  tissues of IL-17 group had increased ( < 0.05). The levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases in peripheral blood of mice in IL-17 group were significantly higher than other three groups ( < 0.05).

Mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or methionine-choline 4-deficient diet (MCD) and injected intraperitoneally with IL-33. Both mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-33 and ST2 were up-regulated in the livers of mice fed with HFD or MCD. Treatment with IL-33 attenuated diet-induced hepatic steatosis and reduced activities of ALT in serum, as well as ameliorated HFD-induced systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, while aggravated hepatic fibrosis in diet-induced NASH. Furthermore, treatment with IL-33 can also promote Th2 response and  macrophage activation and beneficial modulation on expression profiles of  acid metabolism genes in livers. ST2 deficiency did not affect hepatic steatosis and fibrosis when fed with controlling diet. IL-33 did not affect diet-induced hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in ST2 knockout mice. Meanwhile, in the livers of patients with NASH, IL-33 was mainly located in hepatic sinusoid, endothelial cells, and hepatic stellate cells. The mRNA expression level of IL-33 and ST2 was elevated with the progression of NASH. In conclusion, treatment with IL-33 attenuated diet-induced hepatic steatosis, but aggravated hepatic fibrosis, in a ST2-dependent manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26453839>Palmitate differentially regulates the polarization of differentiating and differentiated macrophages.</a></h2><p>The tissue accumulation of M1 macrophages in patients with metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been well-documented. Interestingly, it is an accumulation of  macrophages that is observed in the adipose,  and lung tissues, as well as in the circulation, of patients who have had major traumas such as a burn injury or sepsis; however, the trigger for the  polarization observed in these patients has not yet been identified. In the current study, we explored the effects of chronic palmitate and high glucose treatment on macrophage differentiation and function in murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages. We found that chronic treatment with palmitate decreased phagocytosis and HLA-DR expression in addition to inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Chronic palmitate treatment of bone marrows also led to  polarization, which correlated with the activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ signalling pathway. Furthermore, we found that chronic palmitate treatment increased the expression of multiple endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, including binding immunoglobulin protein. Preconditioning with the universal ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate attenuated ER stress signalling and neutralized the effect of palmitate, inducing a pro-inflammatory phenotype. We confirmed these results in differentiating human macrophages, showing an anti-inflammatory response to chronic palmitate exposure. Though alone it did not promote  polarization, hyperglycaemia exacerbated the effects of palmitate. These findings suggest that the dominant accumulation of  in adipose tissue and  in patients with critical illness may be a result of hyperlipidaemia and hyperglycaemia, both components of the hypermetabolism observed in critically ill patients.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600295>Association of Parity in Patients with Chronic  Disease.</a></h2><p>The impact of type of  disease on parity rates hasn't been described.

With age, most adult patients with GSDIa develop hepatocellular adenomas (HCA), which can progress to hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). In this study, we characterized metabolic reprogramming and cellular defense alterations during tumorigenesis in the  of hepatocyte-specific G6pc deficient (L.G6pc) mice, which develop all the hepatic hallmarks of GSDIa. metabolism and cellular defenses were assessed at pretumoral (four months) and tumoral (nine months) stages in L.G6pc mice fed a high fat/high sucrose (HF/HS) diet.In response to HF/HS diet, hepatocarcinogenesis was highly accelerated since 85% of L.G6pc mice developed multiple hepatic tumors after nine months, with 70% classified as HCA and 30% as HCC. Tumor development was associated with high expression of malignancy markers of HCC, i.e. alpha-fetoprotein, glypican 3 and β-catenin. In addition, L.G6pc livers exhibited loss of tumor suppressors. Interestingly, L.G6pc steatosis exhibited a low-inflammatory state and was less pronounced than in wild-type livers. This was associated with an absence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and fibrosis, while HCA/HCC showed a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the absence of TGF-β1 increase. In HCA/HCC, glycolysis was characterized by a marked expression of PK-, decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS and a decrease of pyruvate entry in the mitochondria, confirming a "Warburg-like" phenotype. These metabolic alterations led to a decrease in antioxidant defenses and autophagy and chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress in L.G6pc livers and tumors. Interestingly, autophagy was reactivated in HCA/HCC.The metabolic remodeling in L.G6pc  generates a preneoplastic status and leads to a loss of cellular defenses and tumor suppressors that facilitates tumor development in GSDI.Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD1a) is a rare metabolic disease characterized by hypoglycemia, steatosis, excessive glycogen accumulation and tumor development in the . In this study, we have observed that GSDIa livers reprogram their metabolism in a similar way to cancer cells, which facilitates tumor formation and progression, in the absence of hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, hepatic burden due to overload of glycogen and lipids in the cells leads to a decrease in cellular defenses, such as autophagy, which could further promote tumorigenesis in the case of GSDI.Copyright © 2018 European Association for the Study of the .

This study aimed to investigate whether honokiol could prevent NASH induced by high-cholesterol and high-fat (CL) diet in mice and the possible mechanism involved.Mice were fed with CL diet for 12 weeks to establish a NASH model; honokiol (0.02% w/w in diet) was added to evaluate its effect on NASH. Murine peritoneal macrophages, RAW264.7 and ANA-1 cells, were used to explore the possible mechanisms of honokiol on macrophage polarization.Mice developed NASH after fed with CL diet for 12 weeks. Honokiol supplementation alleviated insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis induced by CL diet. Immunohistochemistry showed that honokiol induced more  macrophages in livers compared with CL diet alone. Honokiol decreased M1 marker genes (TNFα and MCP-1) and increased  marker gene (YM-1, IL-10, IL-4R and IL-13) expression in mice  compared with CL diet. Moreover, treatment with honokiol lowered alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in serum and preserved  from lipid peroxidation, evidenced by lowered hepatic malondialdehyde level. Honokiol has antioxidant function, as honokiol upregulated hepatic glutathione and superoxide dismutase level and downregulated hepatic CYP2E1 protein level. Hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and its target genes were upregulated by honokiol. Furthermore, honokiol (10 μM) treatment in mouse peritoneal cells, RAW264.7 cells and ANA-1 cells, led to  macrophage polarization, whereas a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, abolished this effect of honokiol.Honokiol can attenuate CL diet-induced NASH and the mechanism in which possibly is polarizing macrophages to  phenotype via PPARγ activation.© 2017 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28324002>Association of NAFLD With Diabetes and the Impact of BMI Changes: A 5-Year Cohort Study Based on 18,507 Elderly.</a></h2><p>Previous studies about the relationship between nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and diabetes are limited by inconsistent conclusions, mainly being cross-sectional and having a small sample size, no elderly people, or a lack of prediabetes.This study sought to examine the relationship between NAFLD and diabetes and prediabetes in a large cohort based on Chinese male elderly.This was a retrospective cohort study that was followed up for ∼5 years.This study was conducted in Beijing, China.Chinese male elderly (n = 18,507). Participants with diabetes/prediabetes at baseline were excluded.Ultrasound was used for diagnosis of NAFLD.Mean age of the 18,507 participants was 71.38 ± 14.15 years. The prevalence of NAFLD was 18.77% (3474/18,503), and participants with NAFLD had higher body mass index (BMI), blood pressure levels, blood lipid levels, and also higher alanine aminotransferase levels (P < 0.001). The total 5-year incidence was 2.448% for diabetes and 10.628% for prediabetes. Participants with NAFLD at baseline had a higher incidence of both diabetes and prediabetes. The adjusted relative risks (RRs) were 1.672 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.361 to 2.052] and 1.336 (95% CI, 1.205 to 1.481). The RRs were closely related to BMI changes. The adjusted RRs for diabetes according to three BMI change groups (<-1.00 kg/, -1.00 to 1.00 kg/, >1.00 kg/) were 1.599 (95% CI, 1.054 to 2.426), 1.640 (95% CI, 1.241 to 2.167), and 1.918 (95% CI, 1.239 to 2.969), respectively. Similar results were obtained when prediabetes was used as the dependent variable.There was a strong and independent association between NAFLD and both diabetes and prediabetes among Chinese male elderly, and this relationship was closely related to BMI changes.Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29390103>Non-alcoholic  disease and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is an independent risk factor associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). NAFLD is threatening to become a major public health problem in association with the metabolic syndrome. The association of NAFLD with outcomes in patients with advanced CKD has not been evaluated. In this study, the prevalence of NAFLD and its impact on cardiovascular and renal outcomes and mortality were determined in a large secondary care CKD cohort.The study was conducted on 1148 CKD patients within a cohort of 3061 CKD patients, who had undergone ultrasound imaging of the  over a 15-year period. A propensity-matched population from within the cohort was also included. Cox regression analysis was used to study the association of NAFLD with cardiovascular events, end-stage renal disease and mortality and linear regression analysis for CKD progression.The prevalence of NAFLD was 17.9%. The median duration of follow-up after scanning was 5.4 years, with a median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 33.5 mL/min/1.73  in this population. NAFLD proved to be a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular events [hazard ratio (HR) 2.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-3.13; P < 0.01] but it was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.58-1.08; P = 0.14) or CKD progression (P = 0.09 for rate of decline of eGFR slope). Patients with CKD are known to have high cardiovascular risk; the propensity-matched analysis showed that NAFLD increased this cardiovascular risk (HR 2.00; CI 1.10-3.66; P < 0.05).NAFLD has a strong independent association with cardiovascular events, even in an advanced CKD cohort with high comorbidity. The implication is that routine screening for NAFLD may be warranted in CKD populations to enable targeted interventions for CVD prevention in higher risk patients.© The Author(s) 2018.

The aim of our study was to study the changes in the functional state of the  and the dependence of the external respiration function in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in combination with bronchial asthma and obesity.Materials and methods: The study was attended by 50 people aged from 30 to 50 years (average age 42 years), of which 40% were men and 60% women. Of these, 30 patients with obesity I degree (BMI greater than 30 kg / ) non-alcoholic steatohepatitis was detected, and in 20 of patients, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis was combined with obesity of the I degree and persistent bronchial asthma of moderate severity. Duration of the disease was from 2 to 6 years. The control group consisted of 20 practically healthy persons (PHPs) of the corresponding age and sex.Results: In patients with NASH with comorbid BA and obesity I degree there are more noticed syndromes of cytolysis and cholestasis, mesenchymal inflammation, more significant changes in the , as evidenced by the low AST/ALT ratio in this group. Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis on the background of obesity of the I degree with the addition of bronchial asthma of moderate severity and the persistent flow at the exacerbation phase, the content in the blood of markers of the activity of cytolysis of hepatocytes increases (increased activity of aminotransferases serum, p <0,05), cholestasis (increased contentof direct bilirubin in the blood, p <0,05, cholesterol activity, p<0,05, gamma-glutamyltransferase activity, p <0,05 and alkaline phosphatase, p <0,05) and mesenchymal inflammation (increase in the thyme test, p <0,05), which testifies to the aggravating factor and the impact of BA on the course of NASH.Conclusion: The presence of visceral obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in patients with bronchial asthma leads to the accumulation of its clinical course, the deepening of changes in the function of external respiration by obstructive type (a possible decrease in FEV1 and PEF, p<0.05). The presence of obesity and NASH contributed to the development of restrictive type of respiratory insufficiency in the form of a possible decrease in Vital capacity (VC, p<0,05) in patients without BA, and in patients with NASH and obesity with BA, which significantly aggravated its course.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30896957>Bariatric and metabolic endoscopy in the handling of  disease.

However, the benefits of the bariatric endoscopy in this disease are barely documented.to evaluate changes in NAFLD, via non-invasive methods in obese patients who underwent bariatric restrictive endoscopy. Weight, metabolic changes and the level of technical safety were also analyzed as secondary objectives.thirty patients with NAFLD and obesity (mean BMI 38.22 ± 6.55 kg/) underwent bariatric restrictive endoscopy; this included 15 one-year intragastric balloons and 15 sutured gastroplasties (ESG-Apollo®). A non-invasive prospective analysis was performed via analytical (hepatic function, insulin-resistance and hepatic steatosis/fibrosis scores) and ultrasonographic parameters. In addition, anthropometric features and the evolution of the main obesity-related comorbidities were evaluated. The follow-up period was one year in all cases.thirty patients were included; 63% were female with a mean age of 46 ± 13.8 years. There was a decrease in FLI, HSI, NAFLD-Fibrosis Score, hepatic ultrasonographic steatosis, subcutaneous fat (p < 0.001), HOMA-IR, insulin and triglycerides (p < 0.05) after 12 months. An average EWL of 44.02% (16.34% TBWL) was obtained after one year, with EWL > 25% in 27/30 patients (TBWL > 10% in 25/30 patients) (p < 0.001). Obesity-related comorbidities were resolved in 17/30 (57%) of cases, 5/8 (62.5%) HTA, 5/12 (41.7%) DLP, 2/4 (50%) T2DM, 2/3 (66.7%) SOAS and 3/3 (100%) arthropathy. An improvement in HbA1c in the ESG-Apollo group (p = 0.017) was the only difference. One migrated and spontaneously expelled balloon was the only technical incidence.bariatric endoscopy could be proposed during short-term follow-up as an effective and safe alternative in patients with obesity and NAFLD. It stimulates weight loss and improves analytical and ultrasound parameters from hepatic fat, insulin-resistance and hypertriglyceridemia.

Therapeutic drug monitoring of plasma concentrations of atazanavir was performed and genetic polymorphisms, including UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1*28 and multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) G2677T/A, were determined in a subgroup of patients who received ritonavir-boosted or unboosted atazanavir-containing combination antiretroviral therapy. Information on demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory testing were collected and analyzed.During the 11-year study period, 910 patients who underwent routine abdominal sonography were included for analysis. The patients were mostly male (96.9%) with a mean age of 42.2 years and mean body-mass index of 22.9 kg/ and 85.8% being on antiretroviral therapy. The anchor antiretroviral agents included non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (49.3%), unboosted atazanavir (34.4%), ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (20.4%), and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (5.5%). The overall prevalence of cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis was 12.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Among 680 antiretroviral-experienced patients with both baseline and follow-up sonography, the crude incidence of cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis was 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the independent factors associated with incident cholelithiasis were exposure to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir for >2 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 6.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-35.16) and older age (AOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.09). The positive association between duration of exposure to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir and incident cholelithiasis was also found (AOR, per 1-year exposure, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.05-2.10). The associated factors with incident nephrolithiasis were hyperlipidemia (AOR, 3.97; 95% CI, 1.32-11.93), hepatitis B or C coinfection (AOR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.09-10.62), and exposure to abacavir (AOR, 12.01; 95% CI, 1.54-93.54). Of 180 patients who underwent therapeutic drug monitoring of plasma atazanavir concentrations and pharmacogenetic investigations, we found that the atazanavir concentrations and UGT 1A1*28 and MDR1 G2677T/A polymorphisms were not statistically significantly associated with incident cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis.In HIV-positive patients in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy, a high prevalence of cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis was observed, and exposure to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir for >2 years was associated with incident cholelithiasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26591951>Non-alcoholic  disease prevalence and associated risk factors--A study from rural sector of Maharashtra.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  Disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic  diseases and hardly any studies have been reported about its prevalence from rural India.

We aimed to investigate whether PCa is related with NAFLD in Korean adults.Data from the National Health Insurance Corporation between 2009 and 2012 were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression method. NALFD was defined based on the  index (FLI) and hepatic steatosis index (HSI). Newly diagnosed PCa was identified using the claims data.NAFLD based on FLI and HSI was identified in 2,002,375 (19%) and 2,629,858 (25%) of 10,516,985 subjects, respectively. Each FLI ≥ 60 and HSI ≥ 36 was independently associated with the development of PCa after adjusting for other confounders (hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.12 and HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.16-1.23). The association was more prominent among those who were older (FLI, ≥ 65 years old and HSI, ≥ 40 years old), were not currently smoking, were presently consuming alcohol (< 30g/day) and had null components of metabolic syndrome than each counterpart. Non-obese persons with NAFLD defined by HSI had a higher risk of developing PCa than those with body mass index > 25 Kg/.NAFLD defined by FLI or HSI may help identify high-risk individuals for developing PCa particular in the elderly, even in the absence of obesity or metabolic syndrome.

HFC was measured using 1H-MRS prior to test meal administration (before time 0) and at 3 and 6 h. Plasma concentrations of triglycerides, nonesterified  acids, glucose, and insulin were monitored throughout each experiment.HFC increased to 119 ± 19% (P < 0.05) and 117 ± 17% (P < 0.01) of baseline when subjects consumed a high-fat load alone or a high-fat load with fructose, respectively, but was not affected when glucose was coadministered with a high-fat load. HFC was not affected when subjects had fasted or had consumed repeated doses of fructose. When subjects were administered 3 doses of glucose, HFC dropped to 85 ± 13% (P < 0.05) of baseline.Our results demonstrate that fructose and glucose have a different immediate impact on HFC in humans in vivo.

Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) has been suggested as a new noninvasive measurement made during transient elastography to assess  steatosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate CAP as a diagnostic tool for identifying the presence and degree of hepatic steatosis in consecutive patients in an outpatient  unit of a tertiary centre.Between March 2015 and August 2016, all patients who underwent  biopsy underwent  stiffness measurement with simultaneous CAP determination using the FibroScan&reg; M or XL probe. Steatosis, inflammatory activity and fibrosis were assessed using the histological SAF scoring system. In addition, fibrosis was scored according to the METAVIR system, and body mass index (BMI) and the underlying  disease were also recorded.224 patients were included in the analysis; 146 (65.2%) were male. Steatosis grades were distributed as follows: S0 n = 85 (37.9%), S1 n = 82 (36.6%), S2 n = 33 (14.7%), S3 n = 24 (10.7%). Mean BMI was 26.8 kg/, for the S0 group 24.9 kg/, S1 26.5 kg/, S2 27.3 kg/ and S3 32.5 kg/. The CAP differed significantly between steatosis groups S0 to S3. The area under receiver operating characteristics curve for S0 vs S1&ndash;S3 was 0.78, for S0/1 vs S2/3 0.83 and for S0&ndash;2 vs S3 0.82.

However, the prognosis of this subpopulation remains controversial. We aimed to examine whether MHO phenotype is associated with progression of atherosclerotic activity, reflected as the changes in coronary artery calcification (CAC) over time. If so, we sought to determine the role of  disease (FLD), the hallmark of hepatic steatosis, in this progression.We enrolled 1,240 asymptomatic subjects who underwent repeated CAC score measurement during routine health examinations. CAC score progression was defined as either incident CAC in a population free of CAC at baseline, or an increase by ≥2.5 units between the baseline and final square root of CAC scores in participants with detectable CAC at baseline. Subjects were stratified by body mass index (cut-off, 25.0 kg/) and metabolic health state using Adult Treatment Panel-III criteria. FLD was assessed via ultrasonography.Over 2.9 years of follow-up, 25.2% of total subjects exhibited CAC score progression. The MHO phenotype was not significantly associated with CAC score progression (multivariate adjusted-odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-2.25), as compared to the metabolically healthy non-obese (MHNO) phenotype. However, subgroup analysis indicated that the MHO/FLD phenotype was significantly associated with CAC score progression (multivariate adjusted-OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.34-4.16), as compared to the MHNO/no FLD phenotype, whereas the MHO/no FLD phenotype was not (multivariate adjusted OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.71-2.24).Obese individuals with FLD have an increased risk of atherosclerosis progression, despite their healthy metabolic profile.

PICOS criteria defined the research question for the systematic review. A systematic keyword search in PubMed and EMBASE identified 25 studies: 9 assessed prebiotic, 11 assessed probiotic, and 7 assessed symbiotic therapies for a total of 1309 patients.Basic population characteristics, the primary variables of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (utilized for NAFLD diagnosis), and the secondary variables of body mass index (BMI), gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and triglyceridges (TAG) were extracted. Pooled effect sizes of these variables were calculated by meta-analysis. No publication bias was identified using Begg's and Egger's tests or Cochrane bias assessment tool.Meta-analysis indicated that microbial therapies significantly reduced BMI (-0.37 kg/; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.46 to -0.28; P < 0.001), hepatic enzymes (ALT, -6.9 U/L [95%CI, -9.4 to -4.3]; AST, -4.6 U/L [95%CI, -6.6 to -2.7]; γ-GT, -7.9 U/L [95%CI, -11.4 to -4.4]; P < 0.001), serum cholesterol (-10.1 mg/dL 95%CI, -13.6 to -6.6; P < 0.001), LDL-c (-4.5 mg/dL; 95%CI, -8.9 to -0.17; P < 0.001), and TAG (-10.1 mg/dL; 95%CI, -18.0 to -2.3; P < 0.001), but not inflammation (TNF-α, -2.0 ng/mL; [95%CI, -4.7 to 0.61]; CRP, -0.74 mg/L [95%CI, -1.9 to 0.37]). Subgroup analysis by treatment category indicated similar effects of prebiotics and probiotics on BMI and  enzymes but not total cholesterol, HDL-c, and LDL-c.This meta-analysis supports the potential use of microbial therapies in the treatment of NAFLD and sheds light on their potential mode of action.

We aimed to investigate whether NLRC4-mediated TAM polarization contributes to metastatic  tumor growth in NAFLD. Wild-type and NLRC4 mice were fed low-fat or high-fat diet for 6 weeks followed by splenic injection of mouse CRC MC38 cells. The tumors were analyzed 2 weeks after CRC cell injection. High-fat diet-induced NAFLD significantly increased the number and size of CRC  metastasis. TAMs and CD206-expressing  macrophages accumulated markedly in tumors in the presence of NAFLD. NAFLD up-regulated the expression of IL-1β, NLRC4, and  markers in tumors. In NAFLD, but not normal livers, deletion of NLRC4 decreased  tumor growth accompanied by decreased  TAMs and IL-1β expression in tumors. Wild-type mice showed increased vascularity and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in tumors with NAFLD, but these were reduced in NLRC4 mice. When IL-1 signaling was blocked by recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist,  tumor formation and -type macrophages were reduced, suggesting that IL-1 signaling contributes to  polarization and tumor growth in NAFLD. Finally, we found that TAMs, but not  macrophages, produced more IL-1β and VEGF following palmitate challenge. Conclusion: In NAFLD, NLRC4 contributes to  polarization, IL-1β, and VEGF production in TAMs, which promote metastatic  tumor growth.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28252430>[EATING DISORDERS AND VISCERAL ADIPOSE TISSUE - TWO INTERCONNECTED INFORMATIVE MARKERS OF PROGNOSIS OF DISORDERS OF NUTRITIONAL STATUS AND RISK OF DEVELOPMENT OF COMORBIDITY CHRONIC NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES].</a></h2><p>The purpose of research was to study the characteristics of eating behaviour (EB) and indicators visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in patients with NAFLD and obesity stage of 1-2 or excessive body mass on the background of hypertension (H).

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and  Cyp2e1 were assessed. Expression of F4/80, CD68 for macrophages and Ly6G, MPO, E-selectin for neutrophils was measured. Macrophage polarization was determined by IL-1β/iNOS (M1) and Arg-1/IL-10/CD163/CD206 () expression.  steatosis and fibrosis were measured by oil-red-O and Sirius red staining respectively. HCC development was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging, confirmed by histology. Cellular proliferation was assessed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).Alcohol-DEN mice showed higher ALTs than pair fed-DEN mice throughout the alcohol feeding without weight gain. Alcohol feeding resulted in increased ALT,  steatosis and inflammation compared to pair-fed controls. Alcohol-DEN mice had reduced steatosis and increased fibrosis indicating advanced  disease. Molecular characterization showed highest levels of both neutrophil and macrophage markers in alcohol-DEN livers. Importantly,  macrophages were predominantly higher in alcohol-DEN livers. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed increased numbers of intrahepatic cysts and  histology confirmed the presence of early HCC in alcohol-DEN mice compared to all other groups. This correlated with increased serum alpha-fetoprotein, a marker of HCC, in alcohol-DEN mice.

However, the direct relationships between IL-25 expression regulation,  induction and NAFLD remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-25 promotes hepatic macrophage differentiation into M2a macrophages both in vivo and in vitro via the IL-13/STAT6 pathway.  macrophages that were differentiated in vitro were able to ameliorate high-fat diet HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, we found that IL-25 treatment, both in vitro and in vivo, promotes direct binding of STAT6 to the IL-25 gene promoter region. This binding of STAT6 in response to IL-25 treatment also resulted in the increase of IL-25 expression in hepatocytes. Together, these findings identify IL-25 as a protective factor against HFD-induced hepatic steatosis by inducing an increase of IL-25 expression in hepatocytes and through promotion of M2a macrophage production.© 2018 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28237848>IL-17 axis accelerates the inflammatory progression of obese in mice via TBK1 and IKBKE pathway.</a></h2><p>Obesity mediates immune inflammatory response and induces IL-17 expression. Adipgenesis can be regulated by IL-17 and it causes TBK1 activation. The inhibition of TBK1 and the inhibition of I IKBKE reduces inflammatory response and improves obesity. It is hypothesized that IL-17 deficiency inhibits obesity progression and inflammation. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated in vitro and treated with IL-17. RAW264.7 cells and differentiated 3T3-L1 were pretreated with TBK1 inhibitor and then stimulated with IL-17. Wild-type and IL-17 knock out mice were fed with high-fat diet. IL-17 inhibits adipocyte differentiation from mouse-derived 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and reduces mRNA expression of proadipogenic transcription factors and adipokines in adipocyte cells. IL-17 also showed up-regulation of mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines in RAW cells. The inhibitor of TBK1 and IKBKE attenuates the effect of IL-17. Loss of IL-17 deficiency improves diet-induced obesity, , glucose and lipid metabolism in mice. The expression of TBK1 and IKBKE decreased in the spleen and  of IL-17 deficiency mice. Moreover, the inflammatory response within the visceral adipose tissue and Th1 cells were inhibited, however,  macrophage and Th2 cells increased in IL-17 deficiency mice. IL-17 inhibits adipogenesis where a lack of IL-17 ameliorates glucose metabolism. As well, the inhibition of TBK1 reduces inflammation induced by IL-17. Therefore, IL-17 may be involved in the development of obesity and metabolic dysfunction in a TBK1-dependent manner.Copyright © 2017 European Federation of Immunological Societies.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential usefulness of transient elastography (TE), which is a technique that allows measuring both fibrosis and liver fat content simultaneously, as a screening tool for hepatic involvement in Turkish patients with T2DM.We obtained liver stiffness measurements (LSMs, as a measure of fibrosis) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP, as a marker of steatosis) in 124 (46 males and 78 females; mean body mass index (BMI): 33.2±6.6 kg/) Turkish patients with T2DM. The prevalence rates of overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome in our sample were 28.2%, 64.5%, and 77.4%, respectively. Probe-specific LSM cut-off values were used to define advanced fibrosis (>F3) and cirrhosis (F4) (M probe: F3=9.6-11.4 kPa, F4 >11.5 kPa and XL probe: F3=9.3-10.9 kPa, F4 >11.0 kPa). Mild, moderate, and severe steatosis were defined as CAP 222-232 dB/m, CAP 233-289 dB/m, and CAP >290 dB/m, respectively.Advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were identified in 21 (16.9%) and 10 (8.0%) patients, respectively. TE-defined hepatic steatosis (CAP>222 dB/m) was detected in 117 (94.3%) patients. Mild, moderate, and severe steatosis were identified in 0, 29, and 88 patients, respectively.TE is a useful non-invasive imaging modality to screen for liver involvement in Turkish patients with T2DM.

Despite its increased global incidence, very few promising treatments for NASH are available. Pirfenidone is an antifibrotic agent used to treat pulmonary fibrosis; it suppresses the pulmonary influx of T cells and macrophages. Here, we investigated the effect of pirfenidone in a mouse model of lipotoxicity-induced NASH via a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet. After 12 weeks of feeding, pirfenidone administration attenuated excessive hepatic lipid accumulation and peroxidation by reducing the expression of genes related to lipogenesis and  acid synthesis and enhancing the expression of those related to  acid oxidation. Flow cytometry indicated that pirfenidone reduced the number of total hepatic macrophages, particularly CD11cCD206(M1)-type macrophages, increased the number of CD11cCD206()-type macrophages, and subsequently reduced T-cell numbers, which helped improve insulin resistance and steatohepatitis. Moreover, pirfenidone downregulated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mRNA expression of M1 marker genes and upregulated IL-4-induced  marker genes in a dose-dependent manner in RAW264.7 macrophages. Importantly, pirfenidone reversed insulin resistance, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in mice with pre-existing NASH.

However, insulin suppression of very low-density lipoprotein-triglyceride (VLDL-TG) kinetics is not fully understood.The objective of the study was to determine VLDL-TG, glucose, and palmitate kinetics during fasting and hyperinsulinemia in men with (NAFLD+) and without NAFLD (NAFLD−).Twenty-seven nondiabetic, upper-body obese (waist to hip ratio > 0.9, body mass index > 28 kg/) men, 18 NAFLD+, and nine NAFLD− determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy were enrolled.14C-labeled VLDL-TG and 3H-labeled glucose and palmitate tracers were applied in combination with indirect calorimetry and breath samples to assess kinetics and substrate oxidations postabsorptively and during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Dual-X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging assessed body composition. fat content was greater in NAFLD+ than NAFLD− men (21.0% vs 3.7%), even though body composition, metabolites (except triglycerides), and insulin were similar in the groups. Insulin suppression of VLDL-TG secretion (P = .0001), oxidation (P = .0003), and concentration (P= .008) as well as percentage decreases were lower in NAFLD+ than NAFLD− men (secretion: 31.9% ± 17.2% vs 64.7% ± 19.9%; oxidation: −9.0% ± 24.7% vs 46.5% ± 36.6%; concentration: 11.9% ± 20.7% vs 56.2% ± 22.9%, all P < .001). Likewise, lower insulin suppression of very low-density lipoprotein particle size was present in NAFLD+ than NAFLD− men (P = .0002). Conversely, insulin suppression of endogenous glucose production was similar in the groups.Compared with endogenous glucose production, the inability of NAFLD+ men to suppress VLDL-TG kinetics to compensate for the increased  fat content seems to be an early pathophysiological manifestation of male NAFLD+. These data suggest therapeutic targets reducing  fat content may ameliorate metabolic abnormalities associated with NAFLD and presumably diabetes.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30145563>Cirrhosis in Hemochromatosis: Independent Risk Factors in 368 HFE p.C282Y Homozygotes.</a></h2><p>We sought to identify independent risk factors for cirrhosis in HFE p.C282Y homozygotes in a cross-sectional study.We evaluated 368 p.C282Y homozygotes who underwent  biopsy and compared characteristics of those with and without cirrhosis.

Cirrhosis was diagnosed in 86 participants (23.4%). Participants with cirrhosis had significantly greater mean age, proportion of men, diabetes prevalence, mean daily alcohol intake, prevalence of swollen/ tender 2nd/3rd metacarpophalangeal joints, mean serum ferritin, elevated alanine aminotransferase, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, and mean iron removed; and significantly fewer mean blood pints/units donated. GNPAT p.D519G positivity was detected in 82 of 188 participants (43.6%). In a multivariable model for cirrhosis, there were four significant positive associations: age (10-y intervals) (odds ratio 2.2 [95% confidence interval 1.5, 3.3]); diabetes (3.3; [1.1, 9.7]); alcohol intake (14 g alcohol drinks/d) (1.5 [1.2, 1.8]); and iron removed, g (1.3 [1.2, 1.4]).

A critical cause of NASH is chronic systemic inflammation promoted by innate immune cells, such as  macrophages (Mϕ) and natural killer (NK) cells. However, little is known about how the crosstalk between Mϕ and NK cells contributes to regulate NASH progression to fibrosis. In this report, we demonstrate that NKp46(+) cells play an important role in preventing NASH progression to fibrosis by regulating M1/ polarization of  Mϕ. Using a murine model of NASH, we demonstrate that DX5(+)NKp46(+) NK cells are increased during disease and play a role in polarizing Mϕ toward M1-like phenotypes. This NK's immunoregulatory function depends on the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), but not by granzyme-mediated cytolytic activity. Notably, depletion of NKp46(+) cells promotes the development of fibrosis with increased expression of profibrogenic genes as well as skewed  Mϕ phenotypes in hepatic tissues.NK cell-derived IFN-γ may be essential for maintaining a balanced inflammatory environment that promotes tissue integrity and limiting NASH progression to fibrosis.© 2015 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29414684>Digoxin Suppresses Pyruvate Kinase -Promoted HIF-1α Transactivation in Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Sterile inflammation after tissue damage is a ubiquitous response, yet it has the highest amplitude in the .

The current study was designed to assess the therapeutic effect of overexpression of Il-6 gene through gene transfer on high fat diet-induced obese mice. Hydrodynamic delivery of 1 μg pLIVE-IL6 plasmid per mouse into C57BL/6 obese mice resulted in peak level at 10 ng/ml of circulating IL-6 1 day after gene transfer and above 1n g/ml thereafter for a period of 6 weeks. Persistent Il-6 gene expression did not affect food intake but induced a significant reduction in body weight and improved obesity-associated hepatic steatosis. Il-6 gene delivery enhanced thermogenic gene expression and elevated protein levels of phosphorylated STAT3, PGC1α and UCP1 in brown adipose tissue. Il-6 overexpression elevated mRNA levels of lipolysis genes, triggered phosphorylation of STAT3, AMPK, and ACC, and increased expression of genes involved in  acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. IL-6 did not affect macrophage infiltration but maintained the  macrophage population in adipose tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that overexpression of the Il-6 gene by hydrodynamic gene delivery induces weight loss and alleviates obesity-induced  and insulin resistance, supporting the notion that gene transfer is a valid approach in managing obesity epidemics.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the functional changes occurring in  macrophages during NASH progression. In this study, we investigated phenotypic and functional modifications of hepatic macrophages in experimental NASH induced by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet up to 8weeks. In mice with steatohepatitis  F4/80-positive macrophages increased in parallel with the disease progression and formed small clusters of enlarged and vacuolated cells. At immunofluorescence these cells contained lipid vesicles positive for the apoptotic cell marker Annexin V suggesting the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies derived from dead fat-laden hepatocytes. Flow cytometry revealed that these enlarged macrophages expressed inflammatory monocyte (CD11b, Ly6C, TNF-α) markers. However, as compared to regular size macrophages the enlarged sub-set was characterized by an enhanced production of arginase-1 and of the anti-inflammatory mediators IL-10 and annexin A1. Similar vacuolated macrophages producing annexin A1 were also evident in  biopsies of NASH patients. In mice with NASH, the accumulation of enlarged F4/80(+) cells paralleled with a decline in the expression of the macrophage M1 activation markers iNOS, IL-12 and CXCL10, while the levels of  polarization markers arginase-1 and MGL-1 were unchanged. Interestingly, the lowering of IL-12 expression mainly involved the macrophage sub-set with regular size. We conclude that during the progression of NASH fat accumulation within  macrophages promotes the production of anti-inflammatory mediators that influence hepatic inflammatory responses.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In BMI-discordant MZ pairs (mean ΔBMI = 4.9 kg/) who were concordant for LF (Δ0.2%), few metabolites differed between the cotwins: very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were elevated, and high-density lipoprotein size and concentration were decreased in the cotwins with higher BMI. In contrast, in BMI-discordant MZ pairs (ΔBMI = 6.1 kg/) who were discordant for LF (Δ6.8%), cotwins with higher BMI exhibited lower insulin sensitivity and widespread metabolomic differences: elevations in small VLDL and low-density lipoprotein particles,  acids (FAs), and isoleucine. Within all 64 MZ twin pairs, lower insulin sensitivity associated with higher levels of VLDLs, triglycerides, FAs, and isoleucine.BMI-discordant MZ twin pairs who also are discordant for LF have more pronounced within-pair differences in metabolomics profiles during an OGTT than BMI-discordant pairs without LF discordance.Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29898626>Glucoraphanin: a broccoli sprout extract that ameliorates obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a low-grade sustained inflammatory state that causes oxidative stress in different metabolic tissues, which leads to insulin resistance and nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Particularly, obesity-induced metabolic endotoxemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and inflammation. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of antioxidant signaling that serves as a primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress. Pharmacological stimulation of Nrf2 mitigates obesity and insulin resistance in mice; however, Nrf2 activators are not clinically available due to biosafety concerns. A recent study demonstrated that glucoraphanin, a precursor of the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane, ameliorates obesity by enhancing energy expenditure and browning of white adipose tissue, and attenuates obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance by polarizing  macrophages and reducing metabolic endotoxemia. Thus, this review focuses on the efficiency and safety of glucoraphanin in alleviating obesity, insulin resistance, and NAFLD.

Inhibition of miR-33 has been demonstrated as protective against atherosclerosis; however, recent studies in mice suggest that miR-33 inhibition may have adverse effects on lipid and insulin metabolism. Given the therapeutic interest in miR-33 inhibitors for treating atherosclerosis, we sought to test whether pharmacologically inhibiting miR-33 at atheroprotective doses affected metabolic parameters in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.High-fat diet (HFD) feeding in conjunction with treatment of male mice with 10 mg/kg control anti-miR or anti-miR33 inhibitors for 20 weeks promoted equivalent weight gain in all groups. miR-33 inhibitors increased plasma total cholesterol and decreased serum triglycerides compared with control anti-miR, but not compared with PBS-treated mice. Metrics of insulin resistance were not altered in anti-miR33-treated mice compared with controls; however, respiratory exchange ratio was decreased in anti-miR33-treated mice. Hepatic expression of miR-33 targets Abca1 and Hadhb were derepressed on miR-33 inhibition. In contrast, protein levels of putative miR-33 target gene SREBP-1 or its downstream targets genes Fasn and Acc were not altered in anti-miR33-treated mice, and hepatic lipid accumulation did not differ between groups. In the adipose tissue, anti-miR33 treatment increased Ampk gene expression and markers of  macrophage polarization.We demonstrate in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity that therapeutic silencing of miR-33 may promote whole-body oxidative metabolism but does not affect metabolic dysregulation. This suggests that pharmacological inhibition of miR-33 at doses known to reduce atherosclerosis may be a safe future therapeutic.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30746959>Comparative study of overweight and obese patients with nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic  disorder in the western world.

The associated biochemical, dietary and genetic parameters were compared between overweight and obese patients with NAFLD.patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD (n = 203) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. The MEDAS questionnaire was used to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Biochemical, anthropometrical parameters and the I148M variant (rs738409) of the PNPLA3 gene and rs180069 of the TNF-α gene were evaluated.overweight patients had higher serum adiponectin levels (22.5 ± 21.9 vs 11.2 ± 18.1 ng/ml; p < 0.05) and lower resistin (3.3 ± 1.7 vs 8.1 ± 8 ng/ml; p < 0.001) and leptin concentrations (22.9 ± 21.9 vs 55.8 ± 45 ng/ml; p < 0.001) than obese patients. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was more frequent in the obese group (59.3% vs 41.3%; p = 0.02). The multivariate analysis showed adherence to the Mediterranean diet to be an independent protective factor for NASH and  fibrosis in overweight patients (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.8).NASH was more prevalent in obese patients than in overweight subjects. HOMA-IR and adherence to the Mediterranean diet provided protection against fibrosis in overweight patients.

A recent experimental study showed an increased intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content in mice deficient for aldolase B (aldo B-/-), the enzyme that converts fructose-1-phosphate to triose phosphates.To translate these experimental findings to the human situation.Case-control study.Outpatient clinic for inborn errors of metabolism.Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance, a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by a defect in aldolase B (n = 15), and healthy persons matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) (n =15).IHTG content, assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.IHTG content was higher in aldo B-/- patients than controls (2.5% vs 0.6%; P = 0.001) on a background of lean body mass (median BMI, 20.4 and 21.8 kg/, respectively). Glucose excursions during an oral glucose load were higher in aldo B-/- patients (P = 0.043). Hypoglycosylated transferrin, a surrogate marker for hepatic fructose-1-phosphate concentrations, was more abundant in aldo B-/- patients than in controls (P < 0.001). Finally, plasma β-hydroxybutyrate, a biomarker of hepatic β-oxidation, was lower in aldo B-/- patients than controls (P = 0.009).This study extends previous experimental findings by demonstrating that aldolase B deficiency also results in IHTG accumulation in humans. It suggests that the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate and impairment of β-oxidation are involved in the pathogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27551315>-specific NG37 overexpression leads to diet-dependent  disease accompanied by cardiac dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Environmental factors are well-known causes of diseases. However, aside from a handful of risk indicators, genes' encoding susceptibility to chronic illnesses and their associated environmental triggers are largely unknown. In this era of increasingly rich diets, such genetic predispositions would be immensely helpful from a public health perspective. The novel transgenic mouse model with -specific NG37 overexpression characterized in this article identifies the diet-dependent function of NG37 in the pathogenesis of  disease and cardiac arrhythmia.The -specific NG37 overexpression transgenic mouse model described here was generated using the Alb-SV40 polyA expression plasmid backbone. NG37 cDNA under control of the albumin promoter for -specific expression was fused with a 5' terminal  FLAG sequence and a SV40 early region transcription terminator/polyadenylation site attached at the 3'-UTR. These NG37 transgenic mice developed normally and were physiologically normal on a standard diet. However, in comparison to non-transgenic (nTG) litter mates, these mice develop dramatic phenotypes within 12-18 days of starting a high-fat diet: (i) increased body weight (28.5 ± 12.3 g), (ii) increased  weight (87.4 ± 35.7 mg), (iii) increased heart weight (140 ± 38.4 mg), and (iv) cardiac arrhythmia. The enlarged livers of high-fat diet NG37 transgenic mice was histologically similar to human  disease and contained Maltese cross birefringent active depositions in hepatocytes that are indicative of  disease. We also confirmed via X-ray diffraction the steatotic vesicles in the diseased hepatocytes of our high-fat diet NG37 mice was composed of cholesteryl derivatives also found in human  disease. In addition to cardiac enlargement, NG37 transgenic mice on high-fat diet also exhibited highly irregular bradycardia not present in either high-fat diet nTG littermates or normal-diet transgenic litter mates.The dramatic high-fat diet-dependent symptoms (increased body weight, cardiac enlargement, , and cardiac arrhythmias) characterized in our -specific NG37 overexpression mouse model identifies NG37 as a gene encoding latent lipid metabolism pathology induced only in the presence of an environmental factor relevant to human health: high-fat diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26485523>The Impact of PNPLA3 rs738409 Genetic Polymorphism and Weight Gain ≥10 kg after Age 20 on Non-Alcoholic  Disease in Non-Obese Japanese Individuals.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in non-obese individuals is inadequately elucidated. We aim to investigate the impact of known genetic polymorphisms on NAFLD and the interaction between genetic risks and weight gain on NAFLD in obese and non-obese Japanese individuals. A total of 1164 participants who received health checkups were included. Participants with excessive alcohol consumption, with viral hepatitis or other inappropriate cases were excluded.  was diagnosed by ultrasonography. Participants with a body mass index (BMI) of <18.5 kg/, 18.5-22.9 kg/, 23.0-24.9 kg/ and ≥25 kg/ were classified underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese, respectively. Self-administered questionnaire for lifestyle was assessed and a total of 8 previously reported genetic polymorphisms were chosen and examined. In all, 824 subjects were enrolled. The overall prevalence of NAFLD was 33.0%: 0% in underweight, 15.3% in normal weight, 41.1% in overweight and 71.7% in obese individuals. The prevalence of NAFLD is more affected by the G allele of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) rs738409 in normal weight (odds ratio (OR) 3.52; 95%-CI: 1.42-8.71; P = 0.0063) and in overweight individuals (OR 2.60; 95%-CI: 1.14-5.91; P = 0.0225) than in obese individuals (not significant). Moreover, the G allele of PNPLA3 rs738409 and weight gain ≥10 kg after age 20 had a joint effect on the risk of NAFLD in the normal weight (OR 12.00; 95% CI: 3.71-38.79; P = 3.3×10-5) and the overweight individuals (OR 13.40; 95% CI: 2.92-61.36; P = 0.0008). The G allele of PNPLA3 rs738409 is a prominent risk factor for NAFLD and the interaction between the PNPLA3 rs738409 and weight gain ≥10 kg after age 20 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, especially in non-obese Japanese individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237317>Relationship between Grip Strength and Nonalcoholic  Disease in Men Living with HIV Referred to a Metabolic Clinic.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to assess the relationship between grip strength (GS) and nonalcoholic  (NAFLD) in treated HIV-infected men.

Although Asians can readily develop metabolic disease without obesity, the clinical features of nonobese, apparently healthy, Asians with reduced adipose tissue insulin sensitivity (ATIS) have not been elucidated.To investigate the clinical parameters associated with reduced ATIS in nonobese, apparently healthy (body mass index <25 kg/), Japanese men.We studied 52 nonobese Japanese men without cardiometabolic risk factors. Using a two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with a glucose tracer, we evaluated the insulin sensitivity in muscle, , and adipose tissue. ATIS was calculated as the percentage of free  acid (FFA) suppression/insulin concentration during the first step of the glucose clamp.Using the median ATIS value, the subjects were divided into low- and high-FFA suppression groups. The low-FFA suppression group had moderate fat accumulation in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue and . Compared with the high-FFA group, they also had a lower fitness level, decreased insulin clearance, impaired insulin sensitivity in muscle, moderately elevated triglycerides, and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. All these factors correlated significantly with ATIS. Hepatic insulin sensitivity was comparable between the two groups.In nonobese, apparently healthy, Japanese men, reduced ATIS was associated with moderate fat accumulation in subcutaneous fat and , lower insulin clearance, muscle insulin resistance, and moderate lipedema. These data suggest that reduced ATIS can occur early in the development of the metabolic syndrome, even in nonobese, apparently healthy, men.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28672736>Innate immunity orchestrates adipose tissue homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Obesity is strongly associated with multiple diseases including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,  disease, neurodegenerative diseases and cancers, etc. Adipose tissue (AT), mainly brown AT (BAT) and white AT (WAT), is an important metabolic and endocrine organ that maintains whole-body homeostasis. BAT contributes to non-shivering thermogenesis in a cold environment; WAT stores energy and produces adipokines that fine-tune metabolic and inflammatory responses. Obesity is often characterized by over-expansion and inflammation of WAT where inflammatory cells/mediators are abundant, especially pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation and leading to insulin resistance and metabolic complications. Macrophages constitute the major component of innate immunity and can be activated as a M1 or  (anti-inflammatory) phenotype in response to environmental stimuli. Polarized M1 macrophage causes AT inflammation, whereas polarized  macrophage promotes WAT remodeling into the BAT phenotype, also known as WAT browning/beiging, which enhances insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. This review will discuss the regulation of AT homeostasis in relation to innate immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28695813>Value of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging in the Diagnosis of Early Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Objective To evaluate the value of acoustic radiation force impulse(ARFI)imaging in the diagnosis of early non-alcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH).Methods Totally 32 SD rats were randomly divided into high-fat diet group(n=24)and normal-diet group(n=8)by using the random number table. At the end of the 4,8,12,and 16 week,six rats from the high-diet group and two rats from the normal-diet group were selected blindly for weighting,blood biochemical test,conventional ultrasound,and ARFI imaing. HE staining was used for pathological observation. Results None of the 32 rats developed  fibrosis. Based on the pathological results,these rats were divided into M1 [mild-to-moderate simple (SS)],(severe SS),M3(severe SS with early NASH),and C groups(normal control). Early NASH was seen only in the severe hepatic steatosis groups,and its distribution had a significant difference(P=0.006). The diagnostic accuracy of conventional ultrasound based on histological results was 34.4%(11/32). The ARFI value of M3 group was significantly lower than that of  group [(1.16±0.04)m/s vs.(1.22±0.05)m/s;t=2.301,P=0.04),and the low-density lipoprotein of M3 group was significantly higher than  group [(1.53±0.07)mmol/L vs.(1.21±0.22)mmol/L;t=3.075,P=0.01),while other clinical indicators had no statistical difference between these two groups. Conclusions The development of early NASH is associated with the severity of hepatic steatosis.

Excessive ectopic fat deposition in obesity causes disorders of energy homeostasis and low-grade chronic inflammation in metabolic tissues. In particular, obesity-induced recruitment and activation of adipose tissue macrophages play a key role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and T2D. Therefore, treatment options for energy metabolism and macrophage polarization in obese subjects are needed. Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, thereby having subsequent anti-hyperglycemic effects and reducing body weight. We recently reported that the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin increases fat utilization and browning in white adipose tissue and attenuates obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance by activating  macrophages. Thus, this review focuses on the beneficial effects of empagliflozin in energy homeostasis and obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29846412> biopsy may facilitate pancreatic graft evaluation: Positive association between  steatosis and pancreatic graft adipose infiltration.</a></h2><p>The number of pancreatic transplants has decreased in recent years.

Positive gamma associations between pancreatic and  macroscopic and microscopic findings (0.98; confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-1 and 0.52; CI 0.04-1, respectively) were observed. Furthermore, comparisons of  microscopy findings showed significant differences between severe versus absent (p<0.001), severe versus mild (p<0.001), and severe versus moderate classifications (p<0.001). The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.94 for the diagnosis of steatosis by BMI evaluation using a cut-off BMI of 27.5 kg/, which yielded 100% sensitivity, 87% specificity, and 100% negative predictive value.We observed a positive association of macroscopic and microscopic histopathological findings in steatotic livers with adipose infiltration of pancreatic grafts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26603489>Astaxanthin prevents and reverses diet-induced insulin resistance and steatohepatitis in mice: A comparison with vitamin E.</a></h2><p>Hepatic insulin resistance and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) could be caused by excessive hepatic lipid accumulation and peroxidation. Vitamin E has become a standard treatment for NASH. However, astaxanthin, an antioxidant carotenoid, inhibits lipid peroxidation more potently than vitamin E. Here, we compared the effects of astaxanthin and vitamin E in NASH. We first demonstrated that astaxanthin ameliorated hepatic steatosis in both genetically (ob/ob) and high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. In a lipotoxic model of NASH: mice fed a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet, astaxanthin alleviated excessive hepatic lipid accumulation and peroxidation, increased the proportion of M1-type macrophages/Kupffer cells, and activated stellate cells to improve hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, astaxanthin caused an -dominant shift in macrophages/Kupffer cells and a subsequent reduction in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell recruitment in the , which contributed to improved insulin resistance and hepatic inflammation. Importantly, astaxanthin reversed insulin resistance, as well as hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, in pre-existing NASH. Overall, astaxanthin was more effective at both preventing and treating NASH compared with vitamin E in mice. Furthermore, astaxanthin improved hepatic steatosis and tended to ameliorate the progression of NASH in biopsy-proven human subjects. These results suggest that astaxanthin might be a novel and promising treatment for NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31232044>Association between Serum Ferritin Level and Nonalcoholic  Disease in a Non-Obese Chinese Population: a Cross-Sectional Study.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study is to evaluate the cross-sectional association between serum ferritin level and nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in a non-obese Chinese population.A cross-sectional study was performed among 1,020 non-obese subjects (body mass index < 25 kg/) who took their annual health examination at the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University.

Obesity is the cause of many serious diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Bariatric surgery is the only effective method of achieving weight loss in patients with morbid obesity.The aim of the study was to assess the impact of bariatric surgery on non-alcoholic  disease in patients operated on due to morbid obesity.We included 20 patients who were qualified for bariatric procedures based on BMI &gt; 40 kg/  or BMI &gt; 35kg/ with the presence of comorbidities. The average body weight in the group was 143.85kg, with an average BMI of 49.16kg/.

Chemerin mRNA was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, chemerin, and CMKLR1 immunohistochemical expression with specific antibodies, while serum chemerin concentration was assessed with commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Serum chemerin concentration reached 874.1 ±234.6 ng/ml. There was no difference in serum chemerin levels between patients with BMI < 40 kg/ and ≥ 40 kg/. Serum chemerin concentration tended to be higher in patients with hepatocyte ballooning, greater extent of steatosis, and definite nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).  chemerin mRNA was observed in all included patients and was markedly, but insignificantly, higher in those with BMI ≥ 40 kg/, hepatocyte ballooning, greater extent of steatosis, and definite NASH. Hepatic chemerin mRNA might be a predictor of hepatic steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and NAFLD activity score (NAS) but seemed not to be a primary driver regulating  necroinflammatory activity and fibrosis.

The metabolic processes underlying NAFLD and Type 2 diabetes are part of an integrated mechanism but little is known about how these conditions may differentially affect the heart. We compared the impact of NAFLD and Type 2 diabetes on cardiac structure, function and metabolism.19 adults with Type 2 diabetes (62 ± 8 years), 19 adults with NAFLD (54 ± 15 years) and 19 healthy controls (56 ± 14 years) underwent assessment of cardiac structure, function and metabolism using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging, tagging and spectroscopy at 3.0 T.Adults with NAFLD and Type 2 diabetes demonstrate concentric remodelling with an elevated eccentricity ratio compared to controls (1.05 ± 0.3 vs. 1.12 ± 0.2 vs. 0.89 ± 0.2 g/ml; p < 0.05). Despite this, only the Type 2 diabetes group demonstrate significant systolic and diastolic dysfunction evidenced by a reduced stroke index (31 ± 7vs. controls, 38 ± 10, p < 0.05 ml/) and reduced E/A (0.9 ± 0.4 vs. controls, 1.9 ± 1.4, p < 0.05) respectively. The torsion to shortening ratio was higher in Type 2 diabetes compared to NAFLD (0.58 ± 0.16 vs. 0.44 ± 0.13; p < 0.05). Significant associations were observed between fasting blood glucose/HbA1c and diastolic parameters as well as the torsion to shortening ratio (all p < 0.05).

Regarding the combinative effects of Nutrigenomics and Nutrigenetics and due to the lack of in vivo studies conducted using natural ligands of PPARs, we aimed to evaluate the effects of DHA supplementation on vascular function, telomerase activity, and PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1 pathway, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), based on the Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPARγ encoding gene. 72 T2DM patients (36 dominant and 36 recessive allele carriers), aged 30-70, with body mass index of 18.5 to 35 kg/, will be participated in this double blind randomized controlled trial. In each group, stratification will be performed based on sex and age and participants will be randomly assigned to receive 2.4 g/day DHA or placebo (paraffin) for 8 weeks. PPARγ genotyping will be carried out using PCR-RFLP method; Telomerase activity will be estimated by PCR-ELISA TRAP assay; mRNA expression levels of target genes will be assessed using real time PCR. Serum levels of ADMA, sCD163 and adiponectin, will be measured using ELISA commercial kits.

We aimed to study the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NNMT gene, namely rs694539 and the development of different stages of NAFLD diagnosed by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) of FibroScan Echosens®.Transient elastography (FibroScan®) with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurement was performed in 81 NAFLD patients (35 of them with  biopsy) and 80 non-NAFLD controls. The accuracy of CAP and FibroScan for the detection and quantification of hepatic steatosis/fibrosis, respectively, was assessed based on  biopsy aspect. Genetic variants of NNMT gene rs694539 were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).According to BMI (kg/), among the patients, 17 (21%) were overweight, 56 (69.1%) obese, and 8 (9.9%) morbidly obese. CAP and FibroScan diagnosed steatosis/fibrosis correlated significantly with  biopsy. There was a significant association between polymorphisms of rs694539-NNMT gene and NAFLD presence and stages. The mutant type (AA-genotype) was found in 33% NAFLD patients versus 1.2% controls (P<0.001), whereas the wild type (GG-genotype) was present in 21% versus 63.8% controls (P<0.001). Moreover, the AA-genotype significantly correlated with the steatosis degree by CAP but not the fibrosis degree by FibroScan. Multivariate regression analysis of all the independent risk factors showed non-significant correlations with the degree of steatosis on CAP. However, by using a stepwise approach, waist circumference showed significance as an independent predictor of NAFLD.Polymorphisms in rs694539-NNMT gene (mutant AA-genotype) could be a genetic risk factor for developing NAFLD and NASH (indicating susceptibility for progression and complications). Individuals with wild type (GG-genotype) are at less risk of NAFLD development.

The underlying mechanisms are not well understood.To evaluate the sex differences in glucose and  acid metabolism in Asians who are nonobese.Cross-sectional study.Clinical Nutrition Research Centre, Singapore.Healthy Asian men (n = 32; body mass index, 21.8 ± 1.5 kg/; age, 42 ± 14 years) and women (n = 28; body mass index, 21.4 ± 2.0 kg/; age, 41 ± 13 years).Insulin sensitivity (insulin-mediated glucose uptake normalized for steady-state insulin; hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), postprandial glucose, insulin and  acid concentrations, insulin secretion (mixed meal tolerance test with mathematical modeling), insulin clearance, body composition and fat distribution (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, MRI, and spectroscopy), cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen uptake; graded exercise test), and handgrip strength (dynamometry).Women had more total body fat but less visceral fat than men;  and muscle lipid contents were not different. Maximal oxygen uptake and handgrip strength were lower in women than men. The postprandial glucose concentrations were ~8% lower, the insulin-mediated glucose uptake was ~16% greater, and the meal-induced suppression of  acid concentrations was significantly greater in women than in men (P < 0.05 for all). However, muscle insulin sensitivity was not different between the sexes. No differences were found in postprandial insulin secretion and clearance rates; however, the steady-state insulin clearance was ~17% lower in women.Asian women who are nonobese are more insulin-sensitive than men at the level of adipose tissue but not skeletal muscle. Therefore, sex differences in glucose tolerance are likely the result of sexual dimorphism in hepatic insulin action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27306613>Enhanced  macrophage polarization in high n-3 polyunsaturated  acid transgenic mice fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Diet-induced obesity and consequent insulin resistance are caused, in part, by macrophage polarization and accumulation in peripheral tissues. Here, we examined the effects of endogenously synthesized n-3 PUFAs on macrophage chemotaxis and polarization.Fat-1 mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed a 60% calorie high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) from fat-1 and WT mice were used in in vitro chemotaxis assays and macrophage polarization studies. WT mice fed a HFD exhibited glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and lipid accumulation and macrophage infiltration in  and adipose tissue. However, these metabolic and inflammatory phenotypes were not observed in HFD-fed fat-1 mice. In flow cytometric analysis, M1 macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue was markedly attenuated in fat-1 mice. Consistently, results from in vitro experiments indicated that n-3 PUFAs prevented adipocyte conditioned medium-mediated macrophage chemotaxis, stimulated  polarization, and suppressed M1 polarization. The inhibition of macrophage migration by n-3 PUFAs was associated with suppression of multiple kinases, such as IκB kinase, AKT, and focal adhesion kinase.Our results indicate that n-3 PUFAs play a crucial role in macrophage polarization and chemotaxis, and thus regulate the development of HFD-induced tissue inflammation and metabolic derangements.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the morbid obesity impedes qualification for organ transplantation.We present a case report of a 56-year-old woman who underwent bariatric procedure followed by  transplantation (LTx). Her initial weight was 130.2 kg (BMI 50.9 kg/). The patient had a history of arterial hypertension, diabetes, gonarthrosis, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and no history of alcohol abuse. She underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedure. The routine intraoperative  biopsy revealed fibrosis (III°), steatosis (II°), and intra-acinar inﬂammation. The operation led to a substantial loss of weight. Two years after the surgery the patient was referred to the Transplantation Clinic of Department of General Surgery and Transplantology with suspicion of  failure due to advanced cirrhosis, which could be a result of previously diagnosed NASH and, probably, excessive alcohol use after bariatric surgery. The patient was qualified for elective LTx, which was performed 3 years after the RYGB. Immediately before LTx, the patient's weight was 65 kg (BMI 25.4 kg/m²). The postoperative period was complicated by bleeding into the peritoneal cavity, which required reoperation. She also had renal failure, requiring renal replacement therapy. One year after LTx, she showed stable  function with normal transaminases activity and bilirubin concentration, remission of diabetes, and good renal function.Steatohepatitis in morbidly obese patients may lead to cirrhosis.

Anthropometric evaluation,  ultrasound examination and scoring for nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD score = 0-6), and biochemical and plasma  acids analysis were performed. We compared the composition ratio of  acids between children with high-grade  steatosis (NAFLD score = 4-6), low-grade  steatosis (NAFLD score = 1-3), and healthy controls (NAFLD score = 0). In addition, correlation coefficients (r) between NAFLD score, metabolic variables, and estimated activity of desaturase indices (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1), delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase) were calculated.Compared with healthy controls, children with  steatosis showed a higher proportion of monounsaturated  acids (21.16 ± 2.81% vs. 19.68 ± 2.71%, p = 0.024). In addition, children with high- grade  steatosis exhibited higher proportions of palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1n-7), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3n-6), adrenic acid (C22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5n-6); and lower proportions of eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3) (P< 0.05).

So far, the prevalence of NAFLD in underweight individuals with and without  (IBD) is insufficiently enlightened. In this cross-sectional age, gender and -matched case-control study, underweight patients (BMI<18.5 kg/) with  (IBD), who underwent abdominal MRI at 1.5 T/3 T with fat-saturated fast-spin-echo imaging from 10/2005-07/2018 were analysed (control-to-case-ratio 1:1, n = 130). All patients were additionally investigated for duration, history of surgery, medical treatment, laboratory values, liver and spleen diameters. On MRI, liver fat was quantified by two observers based on the relative signal loss on T2-weighted fast spin-echo MR images with fat saturation compared to images without fat saturation. The prevalence of NAFLD/liver steatosis, defined as a measured intrahepatic fat content of at least 5%, was significantly higher in underweight IBD patients than in normal weight patients (87.6% versus 21.5%, p<0.001). Compared to the cases, the liver fat content of the controls was reduced by -0.19 units on average (-19%; 95%Cl: -0.20; -0.14). Similar results were obtained for the subgroup of non-IBD individuals (n = 12; -0.25 units on average (-25%); 95%Cl: -0.35; -0.14). Patients with extremely low body weight (BMI <17.5 kg/) showed the highest liver fat content (+0.15 units on average (+15%) compared to underweight patients with a BMI of 17.5-18.5 kg/ (p<0.05)). Furthermore, underweight patients showed slightly increased liver enzymes and liver diameters. There were no indications of significant differences in  duration, type of medications or surgery between cases and controls and also, there were no significant differences between observers or field strengths (p>0.05). The prevalence of liver steatosis was higher among underweight IBD and non-IBD patients compared to normal weight controls. Also, underweight patients showed slightly increased liver enzymes and liver diameters, hinting at initial metabolic disturbances.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29025246>Vaspin mRNA levels in the  of morbidly obese women with nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate hepatic vaspin mRNA in morbidly obese women with nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and to look for its relationships with metabolic and histopathological features. The study included 56 severely obese women who underwent intraoperative wedge  biopsy during bariatric surgery. Hepatic vaspin mRNA was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Vaspin mRNA found in all included patients was markedly higher in patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/ (4.59 ±3.09 vs. 0.44 ±0.33; p = 0.05). An evident but statistically insignificant difference in vaspin mRNA levels was observed between patients with and without hepatocyte ballooning (4.77 ±4.23 vs. 0.45 ±0.29, respectively), with and without steatosis (4.80 ±4.20 vs. 0.41 ±0.29, respectively), without and with fibrosis (0.25 ±0.80 vs. 6.23 ±7.2, respectively), and those without and with lobular inflammation (0.27 ±1.0 vs. 5.55 ±10.1, respectively). There was marked difference in vaspin mRNA between patients with simple steatosis/borderline nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) compared to those with definite NASH (0.24 ±0.96 vs. 10.5 ±10.4). Adiposity is an undoubted confounding factor influencing vaspin levels. Hepatic vaspin mRNA seems to be markedly elevated in morbidly obese patients with more advanced NAFLD and when hallmarks of NASH were observed. Pointing to non-linear mRNA levels within the NAFLD spectrum and an evident increase in patients with fibrosis and definite NASH, the detrimental action of vaspin cannot be excluded.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29947322>Improvements in clinical characteristics of patients with non-alcoholic  disease, after an intervention based on the Mediterranean lifestyle: a randomised controlled clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle interventions remain the cornerstone therapy for non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). This randomised controlled single-blind clinical trial investigated the effect of Mediterranean diet (MD) or Mediterranean lifestyle, along with weight loss, in NAFLD patients. In all, sixty-three overweight/obese patients (50 (sd 11) years, BMI=31·8 (sd 4·5) kg/, 68 % men) with ultrasonography-proven NAFLD (and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels) were randomised to the following groups: (A) control group (CG), (B) Mediterranean diet group (MDG) or (C) Mediterranean lifestyle group (MLG). Participants of MDG and MLG attended seven 60-min group sessions for 6 months, aiming at weight loss and increasing adherence to MD. In the MLG, additional guidance for increasing physical activity and improving sleep habits were given. Patients in CG received only written information for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of 6 months, 88·8 % of participants completed the study. On the basis of intention-to-treat analysis, both MDG and MLG showed greater weight reduction and higher adherence to MD compared with the CG (all P<0·05) at the end of intervention. In addition, MLG increased vigorous exercise compared with the other two study groups (P<0·001) and mid-day rest/naps compared with CG (P=0·04). MLG showed significant improvements in ALT levels (i.e. ALT<40 U/l (P=0·03) and 50 % reduction of ALT levels (P=0·009)) and  stiffness (P=0·004) compared with CG after adjusting for % weight loss and baseline values. MDG improved only  stiffness compared with CG (P<0·001) after adjusting for the aforementioned variables.

However, the role of ACh in human hepatic fibrogenesis is unclear.We aimed to determine the fibrogenic responses of human hepatic stellate cells (hHSC) to ACh and the relevance of the PNS in hepatic fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Primary hHSC were analyzed for synthesis of endogenous ACh and acetylcholinesterase and gene expression of choline acetyltransferase and muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChR). Cell proliferation and fibrogenic markers were analyzed in hHSC exposed to ACh, atropine, mecamylamine, methoctramine, and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide. mAChR expression was analyzed in human NASH scored for fibrosis.We observed that hHSC synthesize ACh and acetylcholinesterase and express choline acetyltransferase and M1-M5 mAChR. We also show that  was increased during NASH progression, while both  and M3 were found upregulated in activated hHSC. Furthermore, endogenous ACh is required for hHSC basal growth. Exogenous ACh resulted in hHSC hyperproliferation via mAChR and phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) signaling pathways, as well as increased fibrogenic markers.We show that ACh regulates hHSC activation via  and M3 mAChR involving the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MEK pathways in vitro.

Intestinal permeability was investigated using urinary (51)Creatinine Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) clearance. Total Kupffer cell counts and their composition (M1 vs.  Kupffer cells) were measured using flow cytometry with F4/80 and CD206 antibodies.Hepatic fat deposition, serum ALT level, and (51)Cr-EDTA clearance were significantly lower in the L. paracasei group than the NASH group (p < 0.05). The L. paracasei group had lower expression in Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX-4), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin 4 (IL-4), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), and PPAR-δ compared with the NASH group (p < 0.05).

In recent years, intestinal inflammation has been suggested to contribute to obesity related metabolic syndrome and targeting gut inflammation with 5-ASA improves diet induced IR, however, its role in dyslipidemia is unknown and has never been explored. In the present study, we reported for the first time that administration of 5-ASA for 12 weeks significantly improved lipid profile by repressing plasma triglycerides and free cholesterol levels in mice fed high-fat cholesterol diet (HFC). In addition,  lipids were significantly reduced by 5-ASA treatment in HFC-fed mice. Mechanistically, anti-inflammatory genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (Pparγ) and  marker, such as Mrc1 and Ym1, were remarkably upregulated, while pro-inflammation gene monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Mcp-1) were downregulated in small intestine of mice treated by 5-ASA. Further, 5-ASA improved gastrointestinal barrier by increasing the expression of the tight junction marker ZO-1. 5-ASA also enhanced cholesterol translocation by elevating genes expression of Npc1l1 and Abcg5/8. Moreover, mice fed HFC 5-ASA expressed increased Pparα in small intestinal and its target genes function in lipid oxidation and hydrolysis were remarkable elevated.

Understanding the mechanisms of cell metabolic reprogramming may present a new basis for  cancer treatment. In our previous study, we reported that a novel oncogene eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2) promotes tumorigenesis under hypoxic condition. Here, we aim to investigate the role of EIF5A2 in cell metabolic reprogramming during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. In this study, we reported that the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of EIF5A2 was upregulated in 59 of 105 (56.2%) HCC clinical samples (P = 0.015), and EIF5A2 overexpression was significantly associated with shorter survival time of patients with HCC (P = 0.021). Ectopic expression of EIF5A2 in HCC cell lines significantly promoted cell growth and accelerated glucose utilization and lipogenesis rates. The high rates of glucose uptake and lactate secretion conferred by EIF5A2 revealed an abnormal activity of aerobic glycolysis in HCC cells. Several key enzymes involved in glycolysis including glucose transporter type 1 and 2, hexokinase 2, phosphofructokinase  type, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase  isoform, phosphoglycerate mutase 1 and lactate dehydrogenase A were upregulated by overexpression of EIF5A2. Moreover, EIF5A2 showed positive correlations with FASN and ACSS2, two key enzymes involved in the  acid de novo biosynthetic pathway, at both protein and mRNA levels in HCC. These results indicated that EIF5A2 may regulate  acid de novo biosynthesis by increasing the uptake of acetate. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that EIF5A2 has a critical role in HCC cell metabolic reprogramming and may serve as a prominent novel therapeutic target for  cancer treatment.© The Author 2016.

MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory  macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by metabolic pathways through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological syndrome closely related to obesity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid metabolism and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid metabolism and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25716995>Alcohol-induced miR-27a regulates differentiation and  macrophage polarization of normal human monocytes.</a></h2><p>Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of  disease characterized by  inflammation, , alcoholic hepatitis, or  cirrhosis. Immunomodulatory effects of alcohol on monocytes and macrophages contribute to alcoholic  disease. Alcohol use, an independent risk factor for progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection-mediated  disease, impairs host defense and alters cytokine production and monocyte/macrophage activation. We hypothesized that alcohol and HCV have synergistic effects on the phenotype and function of monocytes. Our data show that acute alcohol binge drinking in healthy volunteers results in increased frequency of CD16(+) and CD68(+) and -type (CD206(+), dendritic cell [DC]-SIGN(+)-expressing and IL-10-secreting) circulating CD14(+) monocytes. Expression of HCV-induced CD68 and  markers (CD206 and DC-SIGN) in normal monocytes was further enhanced in the presence of alcohol. The levels of microRNA (miR)-27a was significantly upregulated in monocytes cultured in the presence of alcohol or alcohol and HCV as compared with HCV alone. The functional role of miR-27a in macrophage polarization was demonstrated by transfecting monocytes with an miR-27a inhibitor that resulted in reduced alcohol- and HCV- mediated monocyte activation (CD14 and CD68 expression), polarization (CD206 and DC-SIGN expression), and IL-10 secretion. Overexpression of miR-27a in monocytes enhanced IL-10 secretion via activation of the ERK signaling pathway. We found that miR-27a promoted ERK phosphorylation by downregulating the expression of ERK inhibitor sprouty2 in monocytes. Thus, we identified that sprouty2 is a target of miR-27a in human monocytes. In summary, our study demonstrates the regulatory role of miR-27a in alcohol-induced monocyte activation and polarization.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160090>Corrigendum to 'Liraglutide protects against inflammatory stress in non-alcoholic  by modulating Kupffer cells  polarization via cAMP-PKA-STAT3 signaling pathway' [Biochem.

Eight hundred (500 NAFLD and 300 controls) patients were studied. The mean age of NAFLD patients was 44.3 years and of controls was 41.6 years, respectively. The female-to-male ratio of NAFLD patients was 1.8:1 and of controls was 1.94:1, respectively (p>0.05). Hypothyroidism was significantly more common in NAFLD patients compared to controls. Eighty-four patients were detected to have hypothyroidism in NAFLD group compared to only four patients in control group (p<0.001). Mean ALT (55 vs. 21 IU), AST (44 vs. 18 IU), and BMI (29.17 vs. 25.14 kg/) were significantly higher in NAFLD hypothyroid group compared to nonhypothyroid NAFLD. Multivariate regression analysis showed that NAFLD was statistically significantly associated with hypothyroidism [odds ratio (OR) 14.94, 95 % confidence interval (CI), 3.5 to 62.6]. Steatohepatitis was more common in hypothyroid as compared to nonhypothyroid group [OR 3.9, 1.2 to 11.1 (95 % CI)]. The prevalence of hypothyroidism in NAFLD was 16.8 %. Hypothyroidism was closely associated with NAFLD independently of known metabolic risk factors, confirming a significant clinical relationship between these two diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29327896>Obesity and metabolic syndrome as risk factors for the development of non-alcoholic  disease as diagnosed by ultrasound.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a chronic  disease of a broad histological spectrum, characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides in more than 5% of hepatocytes in the absence of consuming alcohol in quantities harmful to the .

However, lipid accumulation in  can be experimentally dissociated from insulin resistance under certain conditions, suggesting the involvement of additional mechanisms. Obesity is also associated with pro-inflammatory changes which, in turn, can promote insulin resistance. Kupffer cells (KCs), the 's resident macrophages, are the major source of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the , such as TNF-α, which has been shown to inhibit insulin signaling in multiple cell types, including hepatocytes. Here, we sought to identify the role of CBR in KCs in obesity-induced hepatic insulin resistance.We used intravenously administered β-D-glucan-encapsulated siRNA to knock-down CBR gene expression selectively in KCs.We demonstrate that a robust knock-down of the expression of Cnr1, the gene encoding CBR, results in improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice, without affecting hepatic lipid content or body weight. Moreover, Cnr1 knock-down in KCs was associated with a shift from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  cytokine profile and improved insulin signaling as reflected by increased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation.These findings suggest that CBR expressed in KCs plays a critical role in obesity-related hepatic insulin resistance via a pro-inflammatory mechanism.Published by Elsevier GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25632188>Factors associated with significant  fibrosis assessed using transient elastography in general population.</a></h2><p>To investigate the prevalence of significant  fibrosis assessed using transient elastography (TE) and its predictors in asymptomatic general population.A total of 159 subjects without chronic viral hepatitis who underwent comprehensive medical health check-up between January 2012 and July 2012 were prospectively recruited.

In a cross-sectional study, to compare fasting and postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle (TRLP) concentrations and size in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women and determine the relationship between TRLP subfractions and whole-body insulin sensitivity, hepatic and visceral fat, and SCD-1 levels.  In 122 federally employed women without diabetes, 73 black (58 African American and 15 African immigrant) and 49 white; age 44{plus minus}10 (mean{plus minus}SD); BMI 30.0{plus minus}5.6 kg/ we measured lipoprotein subfractions using nuclear magnetic resonance. Hepatic fat was measured by proton MRS, insulin sensitivity index (SI) calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose test, RBC  acid profiles by gas chromatography were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, S, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with S and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat, and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR= 0.39, P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007).  Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite insulin resistance in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α superfamily-stimulated pathogenic cascades and M1 macrophage/Kupffer cells (KC) polarization from Th1 cytokines are important in the pathogenesis of IR  injury with hepatic steatosis (HS). Conversely, anti-inflammatory  macrophages produce Th2 cytokine (interleukin-4), which reciprocally enhances  polarization. Toll-like receptor 4-activated KCs can release proinflammatory mediators, skew M1 polarization and escalate  IR injury. Decoy receptor 3 (DcR) could be potential agents simultaneously blocking the IR  injury-related pathogenic changes and extend the survival of steatotic graft.Rats were fed with methionine and choline-deficient high-fat diet (MCD HFD) for 6 weeks to induce HS. Preliminary experiments with HS group and IR group were conducted, and either immunoglobulin G Fc protein or DcR3 analogue was treated for 14 days in all groups to evaluate the severity. In the Zucker rat-focused experiments, various serum and hepatic substances, M1 polarization, and hepatic microcirculation were assessed.We found that serum/hepatic DcR levels were lower in nonalcoholic  disease patients with HS. DcRa protected Zucker rats with HS from IR  injury. The beneficial effects of DcRa supplement were mediated by inhibiting hepatic M1 polarization of KCs, decreasing serum/hepatic TNFα, nitric oxide, nitrotyrosine, soluble TNF-like cytokine 1A, Fas ligand, and interferon-γ levels, neutrophil infiltration, and improving hepatic microcirculatory failure among rats with IR-injured steatotic livers. Additionally, downregulated hepatic TNF-like cytokine 1A/Fas-ligand and toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-κB signals were found to mediate the DcRa-related protective effects of steatotic livers from IR injury.Using multimodal in vivo and in vitro approaches, we found that DcRa analogue was a potential agent to protect steatotic  against IR injury by simultaneous blockade of the multiple IR injury-related pathogenic changes.Copyright © 2017.

NAFLD is associated with hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, resulting in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with advanced fibrosis. Placental extracts have been used to treat various chronic diseases due to their antioxidative effect. However, the effects of the extracts on the development of NASH have yet to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that supplementation with an oral porcine placental extract (PPE) attenuated lipid accumulation and peroxidation, insulin resistance, inflammatory and stress signaling, and fibrogenesis in the  of NASH model mice fed a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet. The PPE reduced the number of M1-like  macrophages, but increased the number of anti-inflammatory -like macrophages, resulting in a predominance of  over M1 macrophage populations in the  of NASH mice. Accordingly, the PPE suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced M1 polarization in isolated murine peritoneal macrophages, whereas it facilitated interleukin 4-induced  polarization. Furthermore, the PPE reduced the hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation associated with the attenuated transforming growth factor-β/Smad3 signaling, both in the  of NASH mice and in RI-T cells, a HSC line.

Hence, a possible deterioration of insulin secretion capacity in patients who are predisposed to the failure of pancreatic β-cell function is a major concern for the pharmacologic inhibition of PI3Kγ. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of PI3Kγ ablation in  diabetic mice, a genetic model of obesity-driven β-cell failure and diabetes. Mice that lacked PI3Kγ were backcrossed into  mice C57BL/KS (>10 generations) to obtain γ mice. γ mice and control  mice were phenotyped for glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, steatosis, metabolic inflammation, pancreatic islet morphometry, islet cellular composition, and inflammation. Pancreatic β-cell apoptosis and proliferation were also evaluated. γ  mice and control  mice developed similar body weight, steatosis, glycemia, and insulin levels after a glucose load; however, γ mice displayed improved insulin tolerance, higher levels of fasting serum insulin, and lower pancreatic insulin content. In γ mice, the number of adipose tissue macrophages was similar to control, but displayed reduced adipose tissue neutrophils and -polarized adipose tissue gene expression. Finally, γ mice have more pancreatic β cells and larger islets than  mice, despite displaying similar islet inflammation. This phenotype could be explained by reduced β-cell apoptosis in γ mice compared with control  mice. Our results are consistent with the concept that the beneficial action of PI3Kγ ablation in obesity-driven glucose intolerance is largely a result of its leptin-dependent effects on adiposity and, to a lesser extent, the promotion of adipose tissue neutrophil recruitment and M1 polarization of gene expression. Of importance, our data challenge the concept that PI3Kγ is required for insulin secretion in response to glucose , and indicate that PI3Kγ ablation protects  mice from β-cell apoptosis and improves fasting insulin levels. We conclude that PI3Kγ inhibition in obese patients who are predisposed to β-cell failure is not expected to produce adverse effects on insulin secretion.-Breasson, L., Sardi, C., Becattini, B., Zani, F., Solinas, G.

Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has been investigated extensively in the context of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of mTORC1 in NASH remains largely unknown.mTORC1 activity in macrophages in human mild and severe NASH  was compared. Mice with macrophage-specific deletion of the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) subunit and littermate controls were fed a high-fructose, palmitate, and cholesterol diet for 24 weeks or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet for 4 weeks to develop NASH.We report that in human beings bearing NASH, macrophage mTORC1 activity was lower in livers experiencing severe vs mild NASH . Moreover, macrophage mTORC1 disruption exacerbated the inflammatory response in 2 diet-induced NASH mouse models. Mechanistically, in response to apoptotic hepatocytes (AHs), macrophage polarization toward a  anti-inflammatory phenotype was inhibited in Raptor-deficient macrophages. During the digestion of AHs, macrophage mTORC1 was activated and coupled with dynamin-related protein 1 to facilitate the latter's phosphorylation, leading to mitochondrial fission-mediated calcium release. Ionomycin or A23187, calcium ionophores, prevented Raptor deficiency-mediated failure of lysosome acidification and subsequent lipolysis. Blocking dynamin-related protein 1-dependent mitochondria fission impaired lysosome function, resulting in reduced production of anti-inflammatory factors such as interleukins 10 and 13.Persistent mTORC1 deficiency in macrophages contributes to the progression of NASH by causing lysosome dysfunction and subsequently attenuating anti-inflammatory -like response in macrophages during clearance of AHs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether only 1-2 weeks of a high SFA diet could impact disease risk factors in overweight adults who normally eat a relatively low proportion of SFA (i.e., <40% of dietary fat).Twelve overweight (BMI: 27±1 kg/) young adults were studied before and after a 2-week diet that increased the proportion of SFA (<40% to 60% of dietary fat), while maintaining their daily intake of total fat, carbohydrate, protein, and calories. Insulin resistance, blood pressure, plasma markers of  damage, total plasma cholesterol concentrations, and  acid profile within plasma and skeletal muscle lipid pools were assessed before and after the intervention.Total plasma cholesterol concentration increased (148±5 vs. 164±8 mg/dl; P<0.05) after only one week, due exclusively to an increase in LDL-cholesterol (78±4 vs. 95±7 mg/dl; P<0.05). After two weeks, plasma aspartate amino transferase (AST) concentration increased (P<0.05) but we found no change in insulin resistance, or resting blood pressure. The diet increase the proportion of SFA in plasma (35±1% vs. 39±2%; P<0.05) and the intramyocellular triglyceride pool (32±1% vs. 37±1%; P<0.05) suggesting the  acids in these pools may readily exchange.Although blood lipids remain within normal clinical range, increasing saturated fat in diet for only 2 weeks raises plasma markers of cardiovascular risk (LDL-cholesterol) and  damage (AST).

Herein, we demonstrate that subcutaneous adipose tissue of type 2 diabetics contains considerably more sphingolipids than non-diabetic, BMI-matched counterparts. Whole-body and adipose tissue-specific inhibition/deletion of serine palmitoyltransferase (Sptlc), the first enzyme in the sphingolipid biosynthesis cascade, in mice markedly altered adipose morphology and metabolism, particularly in subcutaneous adipose tissue. The reduction in adipose sphingolipids increased brown and beige/brite adipocyte numbers, mitochondrial activity, and insulin sensitivity. The manipulation also increased numbers of anti-inflammatory  macrophages in the adipose bed and induced secretion of insulin-sensitizing adipokines. By comparison, deletion of serine palmitoyltransferase from macrophages had no discernible effects on metabolic homeostasis or adipose function. These data indicate that newly synthesized adipocyte sphingolipids are nutrient signals that drive changes in the adipose phenotype to influence whole-body energy expenditure and nutrient metabolism.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In rodents and human patients, RYGB induces an increase in the gene and protein expression levels of the  isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) in the jejunum. Since PKM2 can be secreted in the circulation, our hypothesis was that the circulating levels of PKM2 increase after RYGB. Our data, however, revealed an unexpected finding and a potential new role of PKM2 for the natural history of metabolic syndrome and NAFLD. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, RYGB-treated patients had decreased PKM2 blood levels compared with a well-matched group of patients with severe obesity before RYGB. Interestingly, PKM2 serum concentration correlated with body mass index before but not after the surgery. This prompted us to evaluate other potential mechanisms and sites of PKM2 regulation by the metabolic syndrome and RYGB. We found that in patients with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the  had increased PKM2 expression levels, and the enzyme appears to be specifically localized in Kupffer cells. The study of murine models of metabolic syndrome and NASH replicated this pattern of expression, further suggesting a metabolic link between hepatic PKM2 and NAFLD. Therefore, we conclude that PKM2 serum and hepatic levels increase in both metabolic syndrome and NAFLD and decrease after RYGB. Thus, PKM2 may represent a new target for monitoring and treatment of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408278>Silencing of lncRNA SNHG20 delays the progression of nonalcoholic  disease to hepatocellular carcinoma via regulating  Kupffer cells polarization.</a></h2><p>This study aims to investigate the role of long noncoding RNA SNHG20 in the progression of nonalcoholic  disease (NALFD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to elucidate whether polarization of Kupffer cells (KCs,  macrophages) was involved in this process.

The proportion of M1 and  macrophages was determined by flow cytometry. The levels of M1-related inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor-α and -related Arg-1 and interleukin (IL)-10 were also examined. SNHG20 expression was decreased in NALFD but increased in NALFD-HCC, both in human and experimental mouse livers. Furthermore, human and mouse NALFD-HCC KCs displayed decreased M1/ ratio compared with NALFD KCs. Moreover, SNHG20 overexpression induced  polarization through activating STAT6, whereas SNHG20 silencing suppressed M1 polarization in RAW264.7 macrophages and delayed the progression of NALFD to HCC in mice.

Linear regression analysis revealed that serum triglycerides and log-transformed ATX were independently associated with hepatic steatosis.Serum ATX may be a potential pathogenic factor and/or biomarker for NAFLD in nondiabetic women with obesity.© 2014 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25799683>[Prevalence of no alcohol  disease (NAFLD) in a population of obese children in Valencia, Venezuela].</a></h2><p>No Alcoholic  Disease (NAFLD) is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of fat in hepatocytes, without alcohol, where overweight and obesity are determinants. Ecosonografia evaluated the prevalence of  in obese pediatric patients and its relation to nutritional assessment. The sample consisted of 85 children (51 females, 34 males), age 3-17. The abdominal ecosonography, BMI, waist circumference were performed; Godard Test for physical activity, history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity and cardiovascular disease were questioned. Lipid profile, glucose and insulin resistance were determined. Data analyzed from descriptive and comparative tables. We obtained: mean age 9.8 ± 2.7 females and males 9.6 ± 2.7 years. The ecosonography indicated 50% and 50% -pancreas  in children aged 3-6 years; 7-11 years 39.7% -pancreas; 12-17yrs 31.6% -pancreas (p > 0.05); BMI > 26 kg/ 42.9% -pancreas; 21 to 25 kg/ 44.7% ; 15 to 20 kg/ 60%-pancreas (p> 0.05). 97.6% with high CC; 68.2% with inadequate physical activity; high frequency of history of chronic non-communicable diseases. We concluded that this population had predominantly   replacement of the pancreas (HG-RGP) in the groups with higher BMI, CC and high male unrelated insulin resistance, altered lipid profile and diagnosis HG.

Male  mice that develop spontaneous atherosclerotic lesions were fed 0%, 0.3%, and 0.4% mangosteen extracts, composed largely of α-mangostin (MG), for 17 weeks. Body weight gains were significantly decreased in both MG-treated groups compared to the control, but the general condition remained good throughout the study. The levels of total cholesterol (decreased very-low-density lipoprotein in lipoprotein profile) and triglycerides decreased significantly in the MG-treated mice in conjunction with decreased hepatic  synthase and . Additionally, increased serum lipoprotein lipase activity and histopathology further showed a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesions at both levels of MG exposure. Real-time PCR analysis for macrophage indicators showed a significant elevation in the levels of , an  macrophage marker, in the lesions of mice receiving 0.4% MG. However, the levels of , associated with M1 macrophages, showed no change. In addition, quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of macrophage subtypes showed a tendency for increased  populations (CD68⁺/CD163⁺) in the lesions of mice given 0.4% MG. In further analysis of the cytokine-polarizing macrophage subtypes, the levels of  (), associated with  polarization, were significantly elevated in lesions exposed to 0.4% MG.

We also had the chance to report the efficacy of a low Nickel diet on BMI and waist circumference in Nickel-sensitive overweight subjects.Eighty-seven overweight subjects, with a BMI > 26 Kg/, were consecutively enrolled in a health prevention program, and screened for the presence of Nickel allergy. The enrolled population was mostly females (72/87) (82.8%). Forty-three overweight women and two men showed a Nickel allergy and started a low Nickel diet. After 6-months of dieting, 24 overweight allergic women could be traced and changes in BMI and waist circumference were calculated.Prevalence of Nickel allergy in overweight.Prevalence of Nickel allergy in overweight female was 59.7%, compared with a prevalence rate of 12.5% in the general population. A significant reduction in BMI was observed in 24 out of 43 overweight females with Nickel allergy after 24 weeks of a low Nickel diet. Relative to baseline, mean BMI decrease was 4.2 ± 0.5 (P < 0.001) and the mean decline in waist circumference was 11.7 ± 0.6 cm (P < 0.001).This pilot observational analysis showed a substantially higher prevalence of Nickel allergy among overweight females, especially those with metabolic syndrome and  disease.

But thyroid hormones also produce non-genomic effects that typically start at the plasma membrane and are mediated mainly by integrin αvβ3, although other receptors such as TRα and TRβ are also able to elicit non-genomic responses. In the , the effects of thyroid hormones appear to be particularly important. The  is able to regenerate, but it is subject to pathologies that may lead to cancer, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and non-alcoholic  disease. In addition, cancer cells undergo a reprogramming of their metabolism, resulting in drastic changes such as aerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation. As a consequence, the pyruvate kinase isoform , the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, is dysregulated, and this is considered an important factor in tumorigenesis. Redox equilibrium is also important, in fact cancer cells give rise to the production of more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than normal cells. This increase may favor the survival and propagation of cancer cells. We evaluate the possible mechanisms involving the plasma membrane receptor integrin αvβ3 that may lead to cancer progression. Studying diseases that affect the  and their experimental models may help to unravel the cellular pathways mediated by integrin αvβ3 that can lead to  cancer. Inhibitors of integrin αvβ3 might represent a future therapeutic tool against  cancer.

This study was performed to evaluate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and acute and chronic cholecystitis, and cholecystitis and cholesterolosis. We investigated the clinical implications of BMI as a predictive factor of cholesterol associated cholecystitis.This retrospective study covered the period from January 2007 to December 2011, we included 1,158 patients who had cholecystectomy. We excluded patients with gallbladder cancer, adenomyomatosis, and cholesterolosis without cholecystitis. Finally, we investigated the data of a total of 1,109 patients with cholecystitis. Laboratory test results and clinical data such as age, sex, BMI, height, weight and underlying diseases were examined. We retrospectively investigated acute and chronic cholecysti tis, cholesterol polyps, and other gallbladder diseases such as gallbladder cancer and adenomyomatosis according to the histopathologic findings.There was a significant difference of BMI between patients with cholecystitis with cholesterolosis and without cholesterolosis (P = 0.001). Among patients who had cholecystitis with cholesterolosis, the BMI was 25.2 kg/. Among patients with cholecystitis without cholesterolosis, the average BMI was 24.3 kg/. Weight, systolic blood pressure, platelet count, glucose, triglyceride, and LDL-cholesterol were different between the groups above (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in BMI between acute and chronic cholecystitis (P = 0.05).BMI was associated with steatocholecystitis. However, we cannot predict whether cholecystitis is acute or chronic according to the BMI.

The mice were fed  with a liquid diet containing ethanol and fish oil. In the meantime, ethanol was given every 5-7 days by gavage to simulate binge drinking. After the 7 binge, steatosis, necrosis, inflammatory infiltration, and bridging fibrosis were observed in the  by histological staining. After the 13 binge, the inducers, markers and other downstream genes/proteins of the Kupffer cell M1/ phenotype in the , serum, and small intestine were analysed. The results suggested that a chronic high dosage of fish oil alone reduced the mRNA levels of most genes tested and showed a tendency to damage the intestinal zonula occludens-1 localization and reduce the number of  Kupffer cells. Meanwhile, the combination of fish oil and ethanol damaged the intestinal TJs, resulting in an increased endotoxin level in the . Gut-derived endotoxin polarized Kupffer cells to the M1 phenotype, whereas the number of cells with the  phenotype (markers: CD163 and CD206) was decreased. Interleukin-4 (IL-4), an  Kupffer cell inducer, was also decreased. Moreover,  experiments showed that IL-4 reversed eicosapentaenoic acid-induced  and  mRNA suppression in RAW 264.7 cells. Overall, our results showed that a chronic high dosage of fish oil exacerbated gut- axis injury in alcoholic  disease in mice, and endotoxin/IL-4-induced Kupffer cell polarization imbalance might play an important role in that process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30608932>High prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and abnormal  stiffness in a young and obese Mexican population.</a></h2><p>To identify nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and  stiffness in Mexican subjects with different body mass index (BMI).A cross-sectional study was conducted in 505 adults. Risk for NASH was defined as the presence of one or more of the following biochemical and metabolic parameters (BMPs): fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dl, triglycerides (TG) ≥150 mg/dl, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) ≥2.5, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >54 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >42 IU/L. Body mass index measurement and nutritional assessment were performed by standard procedures.  fibrosis stage was determined by  stiffness measurement using transitional elastography (TE) or by  biopsy (LB).Risk for NASH was 57% (290/505). Most BMPs values incremented by BMI category. Among 171 at-risk patients, 106 subjects were evaluated by TE and 65 subjects by LB. Abnormal  stiffness (≥6.0 kPa) was prevalent in 54% (57/106) of the cases, whereas by LB, 91% (59/65) of patients with obesity had NASH and  fibrosis. Furthermore,  fibrosis was prevalent in 46% (6/13) in normal weight individuals, whereas 4.6% (3/65) of patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/ showed no histopathological abnormalities.

We and others have recently shown that PPARα and its target genes are downregulated, and FAO and OXPHOS are impaired in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, whether PPARα and FAO/OXPHOS are causally linked to ADPKD progression is not entirely clear. We report that expression of PPARα and FAO/OXPHOS genes is downregulated, and in vivo β-oxidation rate of H-labeled triolein is reduced in Pkd1 mice, a slowly progressing orthologous model of ADPKD that closely mimics the human ADPKD phenotype. To evaluate the effects of upregulating PPARα, we conducted a 5-mo, randomized, preclinical trial by treating Pkd1 mice with fenofibrate, a clinically available PPARα agonist. Fenofibrate treatment resulted in increased expression of PPARα and FAO/OXPHOS genes, upregulation of peroxisomal and mitochondrial biogenesis markers, and higher β-oxidation rates in Pkd1 kidneys. MRI-assessed total kidney volume and total cyst volume, kidney-weight-to-body-weight ratio, cyst index, and serum creatinine levels were significantly reduced in fenofibrate-treated compared with untreated littermate Pkd1 mice. Moreover, fenofibrate treatment was associated with reduced kidney cyst proliferation and infiltration by inflammatory cells, including -like macrophages. Finally, fenofibrate treatment also reduced bile duct cyst number, cyst proliferation, and  inflammation and fibrosis. In conclusion, our studies suggest that promoting PPARα activity to enhance mitochondrial metabolism may be a useful therapeutic strategy for ADPKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27548140>Theophylline-Based KMUP-1 Improves Steatohepatitis via MMP-9/IL-10 and Lipolysis via HSL/p-HSL in Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>KMUP-1 (7-[2-[4-(2-chlorobenzene)piperazinyl]ethyl]-1,3-dimethylxanthine) has been reported to cause hepatic fat loss. However, the action mechanisms of KMUP-1 in obesity-induced steatohepatitis remains unclear. This study elucidated the steatohepatitis via matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and related lipolysis via hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) by KMUP-1. KMUP-1 on steatohepatitis-associated HSL/p-HSL/ATGL/MMP-9/TNFα/interleukin-10 (IL-10) and infiltration of M1/ macrophages in obese mice were examined. KMUP-1 was administered by oral gavage from weeks 1-14 in high-fat diet (HFD)-supplemented C57BL/6J male mice (protection group) and from weeks 8-14, for 6 weeks, in HFD-induced obese mice (treatment group). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of tissues, oil globules number and size, infiltration and switching of M1/ macrophages were measured to determine the effects on livers. IL-10 and MMP-9 proteins were explored to determine the effects of KMUP-1 on M1/ macrophage polarization in HFD-induced steatohepatitis. Long-term administration of KMUP-1 reversed HFD-fed mice increased in body weight, sGOT/sGPT, triglyceride (TG) and glucose. Additionally, KMUP-1 decreased MMP-9 and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased HSL/p-HSL and IL-10 in HFD mice livers. In conclusion, KMUP-1, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDEI), was shown to reduce lipid accumulation in  tissues, suggesting that it could be able to prevent or treat steatohepatitis induced by HFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26462899>[Risk factors of  metastasis in patients after radical resection of pancreatic cancer].</a></h2><p>To analyze the risk factors of  metastasis in patients after radical resection of pancreatic cancer.One hundred and twenty-four patients with non-metastatic, resectable pancreatic cancer treated in our department between 2006 and 2012 were included in this study. All of these patients underwent resection of the primary tumor combined with extensive lymph node dissection. The development of postoperative  metastases was carefully followed up, and the clinicopathological factors and molecular characteristics were evaluated by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression using SPSS 16.0 software.Forty-eight cases of  metastases were found among the 124 cases of pancreatic cancer after radical surgery (38.7%). The rate of  metastasis of pancreatic cancer after radical surgery in the age groups < 40, 40-60, and > 60 were 68.8%, 33.3% and 35.1%, respectively. The rate of  metastasis in the body mass index (BMI) group < 20 kg/, 20-25 kg/, and > 25 kg/ were 21.6%, 44.1% and 52.6%, and the rate of  metastasis in the time between the onset and diagnosis groups ≥ 3 months and < 3 months were 59.4% and 31.5%, respectively. The rate of  metastasis in patients with preoperative  was 14.3% and it was 43.7% in patients without preoperative .

The rate of  metastasis in patients with venous tumor thrombus was 68.8% and it was 34.3% in patients without venous tumor embolus. The rate of  metastasis in patients with postoperative chemotherapy was 31.2% and it was 51.1% in patients without postoperative chemotherapy. All those differences had statistical significance (P < 0.05). Univariate analysis revealed that age, body mass index (BMI), time between the onset and diagnosis, preoperative , histological grading, tumor invasion depth, venous tumor embolus, and postoperative chemotherapy were significantly related to postoperative  metastasis. Multivariate analysis revealed five statistically independent risk factors for postoperative  metastasis: BMI, time between onset and diagnosis, preoperative , histological grading, and venous tumor embolus.Our data suggest that patient's BMI, time between onset and diagnosis, histological grade, and venous tumor embolus are significantly correlated with postoperative  metastases in patients with pancreatic cancer.

Moreover, so far, no effective method has been developed to alleviate it. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER-stress) of hepatocyte is associated with the occurrence of  disease, but ER-stress of kupffer cells (KCs) in  is not clear at all. This study evaluates whether ER-stress of KCs is activated in  and accelerate IRI of  livers. ER-stress of KCs was activated in , especially the IRE1α signal pathway. KCs with activated ER-stress secreted more proinflammatory cytokine to induce its M1-phenotypic shift in , resulting in more severe IRI. Also, activated ER-stress of BMDMs in vitro by tunicamycin can induce its pro-inflammatory shift and can be reduced by 4-PBA, an ER-stress inhibitor. Knockdown of IRE1α could regulate the STAT1 and STAT6 pathway of macrophage to inhibit the M1-type polarization and promote -phenotypic shift. Furthermore, transfusion of IRE1α-knockdown KCs significantly reduced the  IRI as well as the ROS of HFD feeding mice. Altogether, these data demonstrated that IRE1α of KCs may be a potential target to reduce the  associated IRI in  transplantation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Inflammation plays a crucial role in the development and progression of NAFLD. Moreover, the pathological formation of NAFLD is closely related to accumulation and polarization of hepatic macrophages. Saxagliptin, a newly antidiabetic agent, can suppress hepatic inflammation reportedly. However, underlying mechanisms remain poorly explored. In this study, we showed saxagliptin alleviated lipid accumulation and attenuated  inflammation with downregulation of inflammation factors in diabetic rats. Moreover, saxagliptin could reduce the phenotype of M1 macrophage iNOS and increase the phenotype of  macrophage CD206. We also found saxagliptin increased CaMKKβ/AMPK activation. In vitro, human THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into M1/ macrophages by LPS/IL-4. We clarified saxagliptin's anti-inflammatory effect by reducing NF-κB, TNF-α expression and promoting  macrophage polarization. Furthermore, we demonstrated CaMKKβ-dependent AMPK activation was involved in macrophage polarization.

However, whether increased FA oxidation simply correlates with or is required for  polarization needs to be further evaluated. Macrophage M1 polarization is associated with the activation of FA synthesis, which directly contributes to the inflammatory response and affects cholesterol homeostasis and neutral lipid accumulation. Finally, recent evidences suggest that macrophages are able to autonomously produce signaling monounsaturated FAs, such as palmitoleic acid (C16 : 1 n-7), and long chain n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated FAs, such as arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. This pathway is regulated by  X receptors and has significant consequences on inflammation and on the FA composition of atheroma plaques.These studies shed new light on the tight relationship between FA metabolism, macrophage polarization, and M1/ macrophage functions.

We evaluated the effect of glycine on metabolic steatohepatitis in genetically obese, diabetic KK-A mice. Male KK-A mice were fed a diet containing 5% glycine for 4 wk, and  pathology was evaluated. Hepatic mRNA levels for lipid-regulating molecules, cytokines/chemokines, and macrophage M1/ markers were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Hepatic expression of natural killer (NK) T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Body weight gain was significantly blunted and development of hepatic steatosis and inflammatory infiltration were remarkably prevented in mice fed the glycine-containing diet compared with controls. Indeed, hepatic induction levels of molecules related to lipogenesis were largely blunted in the glycine diet-fed mice. Elevations of hepatic mRNA levels for TNFα and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 were also remarkably blunted in the glycine diet-fed mice. Furthermore, suppression of hepatic NK T cells was reversed in glycine diet-fed KK-A mice, and basal hepatic expression levels of NK T cell-derived cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, were increased. Moreover, hepatic mRNA levels of arginase-1, a marker of macrophage  transformation, were significantly increased in glycine diet-fed mice. In addition, dietary glycine improved glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemia in KK-A mice. These observations clearly indicate that glycine prevents maturity-onset obesity and metabolic steatohepatitis in genetically diabetic KK-A mice. The underlying mechanisms most likely include normalization of hepatic innate immune responses involving NK T cells and  transformation of Kupffer cells. It is proposed that glycine is a promising immunonutrient for prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome-related nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28344991>Antibody-Directed Glucocorticoid Targeting to CD163 in -type Macrophages Attenuates Fructose-Induced  Inflammatory Changes.</a></h2><p>Increased consumption of high-caloric carbohydrates contributes substantially to endemic non-alcoholic  disease in humans, covering a histological spectrum from  to steatohepatitis. Hypercaloric intake and lipogenetic effects of fructose and endotoxin-driven activation of  macrophages are suggested to be essential to disease progression. In the present study, we show that a low dose of an anti-CD163-IgG-dexamethasone conjugate targeting the hemoglobin scavenger receptor CD163 in Kupffer cells and other -type macrophages has a profound effect on  inflammatory changes in rats on a high-fructose diet. The diet induced severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-like changes within a few weeks but the antibody-drug conjugate strongly reduced inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, fibrosis, and glycogen deposition. Non-conjugated dexamethasone or dexamethasone conjugated to a control IgG did not have this effect but instead exacerbated  lipid accumulation. The low-dose anti-CD163-IgG-dexamethasone conjugate displayed no apparent systemic side effects. In conclusion, macrophage targeting by antibody-directed anti-inflammatory low-dose glucocorticoid therapy seems to be a promising approach for safe treatment of fructose-induced  inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26076562>Noninvasive Markers of Improvement of  Steatosis Achieved by Weight Reduction in Patients with Nonalcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is strongly associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, which are linked to obesity.

Steatotest improved significantly (0.68 ± 0.16 vs 0.38 ± 0.14; p = 0.02). Modification of adipocytokines was significant for leptin (p = 0.018) and adiponectin (p = 0.003). Factors associated with regression of steatosis were weight, BMI, ALT, waist circumference, GGT, HOMA, leptin, VAT and steatotest. Multivariate logistic regression showed the following factors related to improved steatosis: BMI < 25 kg/, ALT < 42 U/L, leptin < 10.5 ng/ml and adiponectin > 8.4 μg/ml.Overweight persons who achieve significant reductions in body weight through 12 months of physical activity and low caloric diet can decrease  fat, VAT and SAT. Even in those with minimal weight loss ALT levels, steatosis, adipokines and cardiovascular risk factors improved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29425212>Insulin resistance in lean and overweight non-diabetic Caucasian adults: Study of its relationship with  triglyceride content, waist circumference and BMI.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is the pathophysiological precursor of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2), and its relationship with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) has been widely studied in patients with obesity or metabolic syndrome using not only ultrasound but also  biopsies or proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H1-MRS) to assess  fat content. In contrast, there are no studies on insulin resistance and NAFLD in lean or overweight Caucasian individuals using H1-MRS or  biopsies for the quantification of hepatic triglyceride content. Our objectives were to study the presence of insulin resistance in lean and overweight Caucasian adults and investigate its possible relationship with  triglyceride content, waist circumference (as proxy of visceral adiposity), BMI, and cardiometabolic risk factors.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 113 non-obese, non-diabetic individuals classified as overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/) or lean (BMI 19.5-24.9 kg/). Hepatic triglyceride content was quantified by 3T H1-MRS. NAFLD was defined as hepatic triglyceride content >5.56%. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), serum adiponectin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were determined.HOMA-IR was significantly correlated with hepatic triglyceride content (r:0.76; p<0.0001). The lean-with-NAFLD group had significantly higher HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and lower serum adiponectin (p<0.05) than the overweight-without-NAFLD group. Insulin resistance was independently associated with NAFLD but not with waist circumference or BMI. Regression analysis showed hepatic triglyceride content to be the most important determinant of insulin resistance (p<0.01).Our findings suggest that NAFLD, once established, seems to be involved in insulin resistance and cardio-metabolic risk factors above and beyond waist circumference and BMI in non-obese, non-diabetic Caucasian individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26528818>Evaluation of Transient Elastography, Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging (ARFI), and Enhanced  Function (ELF) Score for Detection of Fibrosis in Morbidly Obese Patients.</a></h2><p> fibrosis induced by non-alcoholic  disease causes peri-interventional complications in morbidly obese patients. We determined the performance of transient elastography (TE), acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging, and enhanced  fibrosis (ELF) score for fibrosis detection in bariatric patients.41 patients (median BMI 47 kg/) underwent 14-day low-energy diets to improve conditions prior to bariatric surgery (day 0). TE (M and XL probe), ARFI, and ELF score were performed on days -15 and -1 and compared with intraoperative  biopsies (NAS staging).Valid TE and ARFI results at day -15 and -1 were obtained in 49%/88% and 51%/90% of cases, respectively. High skin-to--capsule distances correlated with invalid TE measurements. Fibrosis of  biopsies was staged as F1 and F3 in n = 40 and n = 1 individuals. However, variations (median/range at d-15/-1) of TE (4.6/2.6-75 and 6.7/2.9-21.3 kPa) and ARFI (2.1/0.7-3.7 and 2.0/0.7-3.8 m/s) were high and associated with overestimation of fibrosis. The ELF score correctly classified 87.5% of patients.In bariatric patients, performance of TE and ARFI was poor and did not improve after weight loss. The ELF score correctly classified the majority of cases and should be further evaluated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26921251>Chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection potentiates adipose tissue macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory  phenotype and contributes to diabetes progression in a diet-induced obesity model.</a></h2><p>Chronic obesity and Chagas disease (caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi) represent serious public health concerns. The interrelation between parasite infection, adipose tissue, immune system and metabolism in an obesogenic context, has not been entirely explored. A novel diet-induced obesity model (DIO) was developed in C57BL/6 wild type mice to examine the effect of chronic infection (DIO+I) on metabolic parameters and on obesity-related disorders. Dyslipidemia, hyperleptinemia, and cardiac/hepatic steatosis were strongly developed in DIO mice. Strikingly, although these metabolic alterations were collectively improved by infection, plasmatic apoB100 levels remain significantly increased in DIO+I, suggesting the presence of pro-atherogenic small and dense LDL particles. Moreover, acute insulin resistance followed by chronic hyperglycemia with hypoinsulinemia was found, evidencing an infection-related-diabetes progression. These lipid and glucose metabolic changes seemed to be highly dependent on TLR4 expression since TLR4-/- mice were protected from obesity and its complications. Notably, chronic infection promoted a strong increase in MCP-1 producing macrophages with a  (F4/80+CD11c-CD206+) phenotype associated to oxidative stress in visceral adipose tissue of DIO+I mice. Importantly, infection reduced lipid content but intensified inflammatory infiltrates in target tissues. Thus, parasite persistence in an obesogenic environment and the resulting host immunometabolic dysregulation may contribute to diabetes/atherosclerosis progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913263>Non-invasive assessment of NAFLD as systemic disease-A machine learning perspective.</a></h2><p>Current non-invasive scores for the assessment of severity of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and identification of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) have insufficient performance to be included in clinical routine. In the current study, we developed a novel machine learning approach to overcome the caveats of existing approaches.Non-invasive parameters were selected by an ensemble feature selection (EFS) from a retrospectively collected training cohort of 164 obese individuals (age: 43.5±10.3y; BMI: 54.1±10.1kg/) to develop a model able to predict the histological assessed NAFLD activity score (NAS). The model was evaluated in an independent validation cohort (122 patients, age: 45.2±11.75y, BMI: 50.8±8.61kg/).EFS identified age, γGT, HbA1c, adiponectin, and M30 as being highly associated with NAFLD. The model reached a Spearman correlation coefficient with the NAS of 0.46 in the training cohort and was able to differentiate between NAFL (NAS≤4) and NASH (NAS>4) with an AUC of 0.73. In the independent validation cohort, an AUC of 0.7 was achieved for this separation. We further analyzed the potential of the new model for disease monitoring in an obese cohort of 38 patients under lifestyle intervention for one year. While all patients lost weight under intervention, increasing scores were observed in 15 patients. Increasing scores were associated with significantly lower absolute weight loss, lower reduction of waist circumference and basal metabolic rate.A newly developed model (http://CHek.heiderlab.de) can predict presence or absence of NASH with reasonable performance. The new score could be used to detect NASH and monitor disease progression or therapy response to weight loss interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30378562>[Factors governing development of nonalcoholic  disease and insulin resistance in obesity].</a></h2><p>The factors promoting development of non-alcoholic  disease in patients with obesity and different state of carbohydrate metabolism have been studied. 43 patients were examined; these included 26 patients with abdominal obesity (BMI=52.9±7.9 kg/). The control group consisted of 17 conditionally healthy donors without obesity (BMI=18.9-24.9 kg/), seven of them formed a comparison group that was included to compare the results of study on the levels of tissue-specific expression of HSP70 mRNA. The study of mRNA expression was performed by real-time PCR. The concentration of IL-6 and TNF-a was measured in blood serum by the ELISA method. In patients with obesity with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), a significant increase in the serum level of proinflammatory cytokines was found in comparison with the group of patients without DM2 and control. The results of histological examination of  biopsy specimens in obese patients revealed the most pronounced changes in the group of DM2 patients. Regardless of the stage of nonalcoholic  disease in obese DM2 patients, an increase in the area of  inclusions (relative to the group without type 2 diabetes) was recorded. The study of the HSP70 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells allowed its significant increase relative to the comparison group. The relationship between the level of expression of the HSP70 gene in metabolically active tissues (visceral, subcutaneous adipose tissue and ) established in all obese patients with the serum content of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-a) may indicate suppression of HSP70 expression in these tissues, background of systemic and local inflammation in obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637181>Effect of Weight Reduction on Histological Activity and Fibrosis of Lean Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Patient.</a></h2><p>Weight reduction has evidenced benefit on attenuation of histological activity and fibrosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but there is scarcity of data for lean NASH subgroup. We have designed this study to compare the effects of weight reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean NASH.We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven NASH patients. BMI < 25 kg/ was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second  biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic  disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ 5% weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, 5/6 and 2/6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean NASH.© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

A meta-analysis has confirmed decreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in NAFLD patients. This intervention study investigates whether vitamin D correction ameliorates hepatic steatosis.We prospectively recruited 40 patients from an outpatient  clinic with vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/ml). Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) during transient elastography quantified hepatic steatosis. Patients with significant  fat accumulation were included, which was defined by a CAP value >/= 280 dB/m. Patients received 20,000 IU vitamin D/week for six months, while vitamin D status,  function tests (LFTs), CAP and body composition were monitored.The cohort comprised 47.5% women (age 54.9 +/- 12.1 years; BMI 29.5 +/- 3.0 kg/). Mean serum vitamin D level was 11.8 +/- 4.8 ng/ml. CAP decreased significantly from baseline (330 +/- 32 vs. 307 +/- 41 dB/m) during supplementation (P = 0.007). A mean CAP reduction relative to baseline was demonstrated at four weeks and three and six months: -5.3 +/- 13.8%; -6.0 +/- 14.6% and -6.4 +/- 13.0%, respectively. During these time points, restoration of serum vitamin D levels was observed (34.6 +/- 12.9, 36.3 +/- 10.2, 34.8 +/- 9.8 ng/ml; P < 0.0001).  function tests and body composition remained unchanged.Hepatic steatosis, as assessed by CAP, significantly improves after only 4 weeks of vitamin D correction. Hepatic steatosis is a dynamic process, that can be monitored in the short-term using such non-invasive methods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25777360>ITCH modulates SIRT6 and SREBP2 to influence lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis in ApoE null mice.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages into a lipid-laden plaque. ITCH is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been shown to polarize macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We therefore investigated the effect of ITCH deficiency on the development of atherosclerosis. ApoE-/-ITCH-/- mice fed a western diet for 12 weeks showed increased circulating  macrophages together with a reduction in plaque formation. Bone marrow transplantation recreated the haemopoietic phenotype of increased circulating  macrophages but failed to affect plaque development. Intriguingly, the loss of ITCH lead to a reduction in circulating cholesterol levels through interference with nuclear SREBP2 clearance. This resulted in increased LDL reuptake through upregulation of LDL receptor expression. Furthermore, ApoE-/-ITCH-/- mice exhibit reduced hepatic steatosis, increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity and an increased reliance on  acids as energy source. We found that ITCH ubiquitinates SIRT6, leading to its breakdown, and thus promoting hepatic lipid infiltration through reduced  acid oxidation. The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase ITCH modulates lipid metabolism impacting on atherosclerosis progression independently from effects on myeloid cells polarization through control of SIRT6 and SREBP2 ubiquitination. Thus, modulation of ITCH may provide a target for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28115795>The Role of Tissue Macrophage-Mediated Inflammation on NAFLD Pathogenesis and Its Clinical Implications.</a></h2><p>The obese phenotype is characterized by a state of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation that contributes to the development of comorbidities, including nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). In fact, NAFLD is often associated with adipocyte enlargement and consequent macrophage recruitment and inflammation. Macrophage polarization is often associated with the proinflammatory state in adipose tissue. In particular, an increase of M1 macrophages number or of M1/ ratio triggers the production and secretion of various proinflammatory signals (i.e., adipocytokines). Next, these inflammatory factors may reach the  leading to local M1/ macrophage polarization and consequent onset of the histological damage characteristic of NAFLD. Thus, the role of macrophage polarization and inflammatory signals appears to be central for pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD, even if the heterogeneity of macrophages and molecular mechanisms that govern their phenotype switch remain incompletely understood. In this review, we discuss the role of adipose and  tissue macrophage-mediated inflammation in experimental and human NAFLD. This focus is relevant because it may help researchers that approach clinical and experimental studies on this disease advancing the knowledge of mechanisms that could be targeted in order to revert NAFLD-related fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746485>Adiponectin and the steatosis marker Chi3L1 decrease following switch to raltegravir compared to continued PI/NNRTI-based antiretroviral therapy.</a></h2><p>People with HIV are at for metabolic syndrome (MetS) and  disease, but the role of Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is poorly understood. MetS and  disease been associated with changes in adiponectin, soluble ST2 (sST2), chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3L1), hyaluronic acid (HA), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), lysyl oxidase-like-2 (LOXL2) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) concentrations in HIV-uninfected populations. Protease (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) may contribute to these comorbidities, but the effects of switching from PI- or NNRTI to raltegravir (RAL) on these biomarkers is unknown.Cryopreserved plasma was obtained from a completed, prospective trial of HIV-infected women with central adiposity on NNRTI- or PI-based ART during which they were randomized to remain on their current ART or switch to a RAL based regimen. Biomarker concentrations were quantified using ELISA and Multiplex assays at baseline and 24 weeks after randomization. Wilcoxon-signed rank test evaluated within-group changes, Spearman and linear regression models evaluated correlations between biomarkers and clinical covariates.Participants had a median age of 43 years, CD4+ T lymphocyte count 558 cells/mm3 and BMI 32 kg/; 35% met criteria for MetS. At baseline, higher adiponectin levels correlated with higher Chi3L1 levels (r = 0.42, p = 0.02), as did declines after 24 weeks (r = 0.40, p = 0.03). Changes in sST2 correlated with changes in Chi3L1 (r = 0.43, p = 0.02) and adiponectin (r = 0.40, p = 0.03). Adiponectin and Chi3L1 levels decreased significantly in women switched to RAL vs continue PI/NNRTI.In women with HIV and central obesity, the hepatic steatosis/fibrosis marker Chi3L1 and adiponectin decrease in conjunction with sST2 decreases following switch to RAL. Whether switching from NNRTI/PI-based regimens to RAL can improve hepatic steatosis and dysmetabolism requires further study.Clinicaltrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034016>Associations of plasma CD36 and body fat distribution.</a></h2><p>CD36 is a class B scavenger-receptor involved in the uptake of  acids in  and adipose tissue. It is unknown whether plasma CD36 levels are related to  fat content or adipose tissue in the general population.We measured plasma CD36 from 575 participants of the community-based PopGen-cohort who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue and  signal intensity (LSI), a proxy for  fat content. Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) was defined as LSI ≥3.0 in the absence of high alcohol intake. The relations between plasma CD36 and body mass index (BMI), VAT, SAT, LSI, and NAFLD were evaluated using multivariable-adjusted linear and logistic regression analysis.Plasma CD36 concentrations were correlated with BMI (r=0.11; P=0.01), SAT (r=0.16; P<0.001), and VAT (r=0.15, P<0.001), but not with LSI (P=0.44). In multivariable-adjusted regression models, mean BMI values rose across CD36-quartiles (Q1: 27.8 kg/; Q4: 28.9 kg/; P-trend=0.013). Similarly, VAT (Q1: 4.13 dm3; Q4: 4.71 dm3; P-trend<0.001) and SAT (Q1: 7.61 dm3; Q4: 8.74 dm3; P-trend<0.001) rose across CD36 quartiles. Plasma CD36 concentrations were unrelated to LSI (P-trend=0.36), and NAFLD (P-trend=0.64). Participants with NAFLD and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a marker for  damage, had higher CD36 compared to NAFLD participants with normal ALT.Higher plasma concentrations of CD36 were associated with greater general and abdominal adiposity, but not with  fat content or NAFLD in this community-based sample. However, plasma CD36 may reflect more severe  damage in NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26052006>Lipoxin A4 Attenuates Obesity-Induced Adipose Inflammation and Associated  and Kidney Disease.</a></h2><p>The role of inflammation in obesity-related pathologies is well established. We investigated the therapeutic potential of LipoxinA4 (LXA4:5(S),6(R),15(S)-trihydroxy-7E,9E,11Z,13E,-eicosatetraenoic acid) and a synthetic 15(R)-Benzo-LXA4-analog as interventions in a 3-month high-fat diet (HFD; 60% fat)-induced obesity model. Obesity caused distinct pathologies, including impaired glucose tolerance, adipose inflammation, , and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Lipoxins (LXs) attenuated obesity-induced CKD, reducing glomerular expansion, mesangial matrix, and urinary H2O2. Furthermore, LXA4 reduced  weight, serum alanine-aminotransferase, and hepatic triglycerides. LXA4 decreased obesity-induced adipose inflammation, attenuating TNF-α and CD11c(+) M1-macrophages (MΦs), while restoring CD206(+) -MΦs and increasing Annexin-A1. LXs did not affect renal or hepatic MΦs, suggesting protection occurred via attenuation of adipose inflammation. LXs restored adipose expression of autophagy markers LC3-II and p62. LX-mediated protection was demonstrable in adiponectin(-/-) mice, suggesting that the mechanism was adiponectin independent. In conclusion, LXs protect against obesity-induced systemic disease, and these data support a novel therapeutic paradigm for treating obesity and associated pathologies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Resveratrol has been reported to possess a wide range of biological functions, including antioxidant activities. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of resveratrol supplementation on oxidative/anti-oxidative status in patients with NAFLD.  This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 60 patients with NAFLD (males and females) aged 20 to 60 years, and body mass index (BMI) of 25-35 kg/. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 600 mg resveratrol (2×300 mg pure trans-resveratrol capsules; n=30) or placebo capsules (n=30) for 12 wk. Fasting blood samples, anthropometric measurements, and dietary intakes were collected for all patients at baseline and at the end of the trial. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measurement of serum malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities. Changes in the outcomes were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  Resveratrol supplementation did not significantly affect neither serum MDA, ox-LDL, and TAC levels, nor erythrocyte SOD and GSH-Px activities, compared to placebo group (All P>0.05). Moreover, changes in serum levels of  enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP) were not significant in neither of the study groups (All P>0.05).
