Leptin, adiponectin, and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) may play potential roles in the underlying disease mechanisms. We investigated the impact of fetal exposure to GDM on leptin, adiponectin, and FGF21 concentrations and their associations with measures of adiposity and metabolic traits during childhood/adolescence.The follow-up study included 504 GDM and 540 control offspring aged 9-16 from the Danish National Birth Cohort. Anthropometric measurements, fasting blood samples, puberty status and  percentages by Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry were examined. Serum concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, and FGF21 were measured by validated immune assays.GDM offspring had 38% (95% CI: 22-55%) higher leptin, 0.6mg/L (95% CI -1., -0.04mg/L) lower adiponectin, and 32% (95% CI: -47%, -12%) lower FGF21 concentrations than control offspring (p<0.05). After adjustment for confounders including maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, GDM offspring had borderline higher leptin (p=0.06) and significantly lower FGF21 concentrations (p=0.006). When accounting for offspring BMI z-score, GDM exposure had no significant independent effect on leptin or adiponectin concentrations whereas FGF21 was still significant. In univariate analyses, leptin and adiponectin were associated with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and adiposity, and FGF21 with total  percentage.GDM offspring had higher leptin, lower adiponectin and FGF21 concentrations than control offspring. Elevated leptin and decreased adiponectin concentrations associated with adverse metabolic traits and were most likely driven by higher obesity prevalence among GDM offspring. The functional implications of decreased FGF21 concentrations among GDM offspring need to be further explored.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661889>Combined Exposure to Fructose and Bisphenol A Exacerbates Abnormal  in Liver of Developmental Male Rats.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal  in the liver of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating  include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), zinc α  glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic  accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal  in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636709>Production of galactitol from galactose by the oleaginous yeast  IFO0880.</a></h1><p>Sugar alcohols are commonly used as low-calorie sweeteners and can serve as potential building blocks for bio-based chemicals. Previous work has shown that the oleaginous yeast  IFO0880 can natively produce arabitol from xylose at relatively high titers, suggesting that it may be a useful host for sugar alcohol production. In this work, we explored whether  can produce additional sugar alcohols. is able to produce galactitol from galactose. During growth in nitrogen-rich medium,  produced 3. ± 0.6 g/L, and 8.4 ± 0.8 g/L galactitol from 20 to 40 g/L galactose, respectively. In addition,  was able to produce galactitol from galactose at reduced titers during growth in nitrogen-poor medium, which also induces  production. These results suggest that  can potentially be used for the co-production of lipids and galactitol from galactose. We further characterized the mechanism for galactitol production, including identifying and biochemically characterizing the critical aldose reductase. Intracellular metabolite analysis was also performed to further understand galactose . has traditionally been used for the production of lipids and -based chemicals. Our work demonstrates that  can also produce galactitol, which can be used to produce polymers with applications in medicine and as a precursor for anti-cancer drugs. Collectively, our results further establish that  can produce multiple value-added chemicals from a wide range of sugars.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631099>Empagliflozin's Ameliorating Effect on Plasma Triglycerides: Association with Endothelial Function Recovery in Diabetic Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.</a></h1><p>So far, the mechanisms behind the cardiovascular benefits of sodium/glucose cotransporter  (SGLT2) inhibitors have not been fully clarified.In order to evaluate the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on systemic hemodynamics, glucose ,  profile, and endothelial function, 50 diabetic patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) were included in this analysis and were given empagliflozin 10 mg/d. Cookie meal testing (carbohydrates: 75 g, fats: 28.5 g), endothelial function testing using flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and body composition evaluation were performed before and after six months of treatment. Changes in %FMD between the treatment periods and its association with metabolic biomarkers were evaluated.After six months of treatment, the body weight and body  percentage decreased significantly, while the body muscle percentage increased significantly. The hemoglobin A1c level and fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels were significantly decreased with treatment. Postprandial insulin secretion was also significantly suppressed and the insulin resistance index was significantly decreased. Furthermore, the fasting and postprandial triglyceride (TG) levels decreased significantly, while total ketone bodies increased significantly after the six-month treatment. While the plasma brain natriuretic peptide level was not changed, the C-reactive protein level was decreased and FMD was significantly improved after the six-month treatment. Multiple regression analysis showed that the strongest predictive factor of FMD improvement is change in the plasma TG levels.SGLT2 inhibitors improve multiple metabolic parameters. Of these, a reduction in plasma TGs was strongly associated with endothelial function recovery in diabetic patients with CAD, and this reduction may be related to the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631098>Regulation of angiopoietin-like protein 8 expression under different nutritional and metabolic status.</a></h1><p>Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease with increasing prevalence worldwide. Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8), a member of the angiopoietin-like protein family, is involved in glucose , , and energy homeostasis and believed to be associated with T2DM. Expression levels of ANGPTL8 are often significantly altered in metabolic diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diabetes mellitus. Studies have shown that ANGPTL8, together with other members of this protein family, such as angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), regulates the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), thereby participating in the regulation of triglyceride related lipoproteins (TRLs). In addition, members of the angiopoietin-like protein family are varyingly expressed among different tissues and respond differently under diverse nutritional and metabolic status. These findings may provide new options for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, metabolic syndromes and other diseases. In this review, the interaction between ANGPTL8 and ANGPTL3 or ANGPTL4, and the differential expression of ANGPTL8 responding to different nutritional and metabolic status during the regulation of LPL activity were reviewed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640107>Low Appendicular Lean Mass and Associations with Metabolic and Demographic Parameters in Wheelchair Athletes with Spinal Cord Injury.</a></h1><p>People suffering from spinal cord injury (SCI) undergo metabolic and physical disturbances that target the skeletal muscle, causing a progressive loss of muscle mass.To estimate the appendicular lean mass (ALM) in athletes with traumatic (T-group) and non-traumatic (NT-group) SCI, and its association with metabolic and demographic parameters.Wheelchair athletes with SCI aged 18 to 52 years old were included (n = 62). From DEXA assessment, we estimated the ALM index (ALMI = appendicular lean mass/height2) and classified participants according to the degree of muscle loss (ALMI <   SD from the reference populations). Fasting blood was assayed for glycaemia, insulin, cortisol, and IGF-1 serum levels. Data were compared by T-test and Fisher's Exact Test; predictors of ALMI were investigated by linear regression models.The frequency of low ALM was 63% in overall sample, 55% T-group and 71% NT-group. Low ALM had no significant association with the origin of injury (X2 = 1.1, p = 0.29). Linear regression analyses showed significant association, in the whole sample, between ALMI and serum levels of IGF-1 (Beta = 0.69; p <  0.001), age (Beta=-5.8; p <  0.001), percentage  mass (Beta=-0.26; p = 0.001), and energy intake (Beta = 0.32; p = 0.02). These significances were not maintained in the NT-group sub-analyses.Low ALM was very frequent in our SCI participants, despite exercising and independently of the type of injury. Metabolic and demographic variables associated with low ALM were different according to the origin of injury, which possibly relies on physiopathology particularities. More studies are necessary to clarify our findings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616396>SCFAs-Induced GLP-1 Secretion Links the Regulation of Gut Microbiome on Hepatic Lipogenesis in Chickens.</a></h1><p>The impact of gut microbiota and its metabolites on  have been widely reported in human and animals. However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in  that liver is the main site of  synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and  synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed  accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634484>Deficiency of NONO is associated with impaired cardiac function and fibrosis in mice.</a></h1><p>Non-POU-domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO), a component of multifunctional Drosophila behavior/human splicing (DBHS) family, plays an important role in regulating glucose and , circadian cycles, cell division, collagen formation and fibrosis. Dysfunctional variants of NONO have been described as the cause of congenital heart defects in males. However, the effects of NONO deficiency on the ventricular function and cardiac fibrosis as well as the related mechanisms are not clear. In the present study, we aimed to reveal the overall phenotypes, cardiac function and fibroblasts in NONO knockout (NONO KO) mice compared with the wild-type (WT) male littermates. The results showed that the birth rate of NONO mice was much lower than their WT male littermates at the time of weaning. The body weight of NONO mice was 19% lower than that of WT male littermates (27. ± 1.49 g vs. 22.01 ± 1.20 g, P < .001). NONO KO mice exhibited continuous higher mortality from birth to a year later (P < .05). Compared with those in the WT mice, the heart weight was lower(142.0 ± 8.7 mg vs. 179.0 ± 10.4 mg, P < .001), the heart weight to body weight ratio (HW/BW) was similar, the E/A ratio was higher (1.80 ± 0.47 vs. 1.44 ± 0.26, P < .05), and the left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDd) was significantly lower (.72 ± 0.51 mm vs.3.54 ± 0.43 mm, P < .001) in the NONO KO mice. We also found excessive matrix deposition in vivo. In vitro, NONO deficiency led to fibroblasts hyperproliferation, while migration was inhibited, which would induce collagen maturation and deposition. Conversely, overexpression of NONO inhibited fibroblasts proliferation and increased migration which reduced collagen deposition. RNA-seq of cardiac fibroblasts further indicated that NONO deficiency upregulated the cell cycle regulators, which included cyclin B2, the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1) and cell division cycle 6 (CDC6), while downregulated the migration regulators, which included myosins, integrin and coagulation factor II. Overexpression of NONO further verified the effects of these indicators. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that NONO deficiency was associated with developing heart defects in mice. Hyperproliferation of cardiac fibroblasts with dramatically excessive collagen secretion might be the cause of heart defects of NONO KO mice.Copyright © 2019.

Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin  (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small  droplets around mitochondrial chains, and 5- to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (>5 min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially beneficial against AF in patients with obesity or diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595423>Effects of oral administration of common antioxidant supplements on the energy  of red blood cells. Attenuation of oxidative stress-induced changes in Rett syndrome erythrocytes by CoQ10.</a></h1><p>Nutritional supplements are traditionally employed for overall health and for managing some health conditions, although controversies are found concerning the role of antioxidants-mediated benefits in vivo. Consistently with its critical role in systemic redox buffering, red blood cell (RBC) is recognized as a biologically relevant target to investigate the effects of oxidative stress. In RBC, reduction of the ATP levels and adenylate energy charge brings to disturbance in intracellular redox status. In the present work, several popular antioxidant supplements were orally administrated to healthy adults and examined for their ability to induce changes on the energy  and oxidative status in RBC. Fifteen volunteers (3 per group) were treated for 30 days per os with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (1 g green tea extract containing 50% EGCG), resveratrol (325 mg), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) (300 mg), vitamin C (1 g), and vitamin E (400 U.I.). Changes in the cellular levels of high-energy compounds (i.e., ATP and its catabolites, NAD and GTP), GSH, GSSG, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were simultaneously analyzed by ion-pairing HPLC. Response to oxidative stress was further investigated through the oxygen radical absorptive capacity (ORAC) assay. According to our experimental approach, (i) CoQ10 appeared to be the most effective antioxidant inducing a high increase in ATP/ADP, ATP/AMP, GSH/GSSG ratio and ORAC value and, in turn, a reduction of NAD concentration, (ii) EGCG modestly modulated the intracellular energy charge potential, while (iii) Vitamin E, vitamin C, and resveratrol exhibited very weak effects. Given that, the antioxidant potential of CoQ10 was additionally assessed in a pilot study which considered individuals suffering from Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe X-linked neuro-developmental disorder in which RBC oxidative damages provide biological markers for redox imbalance and chronic hypoxemia. RTT patients (n = 11), with the typical clinical form, were supplemented for 12 months with CoQ10 (300 mg, once daily). Level of  peroxidation (MDA production) and energy state of RBCs were analyzed at  and 12 months. Our data suggest that CoQ10 may significantly attenuate the oxidative stress-induced damage in RTT erythrocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596116>Delayed access to feed alters expression of genes associated with carbohydrate and amino acid utilization in newly hatched broiler chicks.</a></h1><p>Newly hatched chicks must transition from -rich yolk to carbohydrate-rich feed as their primary nutrient source, and post-hatch delays in access to feed can have long-term negative consequences on growth and . In this study, impacts of delayed access to feed at hatch on expression of genes related to nutrient uptake and utilization in two metabolically important tissues, liver and muscle, were determined in broiler (meat-type) chickens. Hatched chicks were given access to feed within 3h (Fed) or delayed access to feed for 48h (Delayed Fed), and liver and breast muscle were collected from males at hatch and 4h, 1 day (D), 2D, 4D, and 8D post-hatch for analysis of gene expression. Differential expression of carbohydrate response element binding protein and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in muscle and liver was observed, with results indicating a transitional delay from  to carbohydrate  when hatched chicks were not given immediate access to feed. Extended upregulation of insulin receptor mRNA was observed in both tissues in Delayed Fed birds, suggesting increased sensitivity to circulating levels of the hormone. Developmental delays in expression patterns of cationic amino acid transporters 1 and  in both tissues and large neutral amino acid transporter 1 in muscle were also apparent when immediate feed access was prevented. These data suggest that delayed transition to carbohydrate use and altered nutrient transport and utilization within liver and breast muscle are key factors negatively affecting growth and  following delayed feed access in broiler chickens.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672758>Relationship of obstructive sleep apnoea severity and subclinical systemic atherosclerosis.</a></h1><p>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common form of sleep-disordered breathing. Untreated OSA might accelerate atherosclerosis, potentially increasing the cardiovascular disease burden in patients. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between objectively measured OSA severity and the presence of subclinical systemic atherosclerosis using non-invasive measurements, including tomographic quantification of the calcium burden.A total of 2157 participants of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, who were free of structural heart disease and underwent both in-home polysomnography and chest computed tomography, were cross-sectionally analysed. Participants were divided into three groups based on the severity of OSA: no OSA (apnoea-hypopnea index [AHI]<5, n=1096), mild OSA (5≤AHI<15, n=700), and moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI≥15, n=361). Calcium deposits in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries were measured by the Agatston score.Participants with moderate-to-severe OSA were 1.6 times (95% CI=1.18-.15, p=0.002) more likely to have ascending thoracic aorta calcification (aTAC≥100 units) than those without OSA, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the association between moderate-to-severe OSA and aTAC of subjects with higher epicardial  volume (EFV) was slightly stronger than that in patients without OSA and lower EFV tertile (OR=.11; 95% CI=1.30-3.43).Severity of OSA in the general population was independently associated with subclinical systemic atherosclerosis. These findings highlight the potential importance of severe OSA, especially in subjects with higher epicardial , as a possible predictive factor for systemic atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647087>Daily red wine vinegar ingestion for eight weeks improves glucose homeostasis and affects the metabolome but does not reduce adiposity in adults.</a></h1><p>Some studies have reported that vinegar ingestion at mealtime attenuates postprandial glycemia in healthy adults and individuals with type  diabetes. Emerging data suggest that chronic vinegar ingestion impacts  and reduces adiposity, although no study has yet corroborated the events of vinegar supplementation metabolically through a metabolomics approach. To examine the impact of daily vinegar ingestion on glucose homeostasis, adiposity, and the metabolome, an 8-week, randomized controlled trial design was implemented utilizing two parallel treatment arms: daily red wine vinegar ingestion and a control treatment. Participants were 45 healthy adults at increased risk for metabolic complications as determined by high waist circumferences. Measurements and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. Central adiposity and visceral  were assessed by waist circumference and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively. Plasma metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Analysis showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (p = 0.003) and insulin (p < 0.001). Insulin resistance was reduced 8.3% in the red wine vinegar group and increased 9.7% in the control group (p < 0.001). No significant between-group differences in body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, or visceral  were observed. Significant differences were observed in amino valerate and indole-3-acetic acid (p < 0.05), with high magnitudes of fold change (>) between groups. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in tryptophan . Although daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks induced significant improvements in glucose homeostasis, our results indicate that daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks is not associated with reductions in adiposity. This is the first study to investigate the effects of daily red wine vinegar supplementation using a metabolomics approach. Our results provide strong rationales for larger prospective studies to further clarify associations among obesity, chronic diseases, and functional foods such as vinegar using metabolomics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672941>Athletes feature greater rates of muscle glucose transport and glycogen synthesis during  infusion.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUNDInsulin resistance results from impaired skeletal muscle glucose transport/phosphorylation, linked to augmented  availability. Despite greater intramuscular lipids, athletes are highly insulin sensitive, which could result from higher rates of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis or glucose transport/phosphorylation and oxidation. Thus, we examined the time course of muscle glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations during low and high systemic  availability.METHODSEight endurance-trained and 9 sedentary humans (VO2 peak: 56 ±  vs. 33 ±  mL/kg/min, P < 0.05) underwent 6-hour hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp tests with infusions of triglycerides or saline in a randomized crossover design. Glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations were monitored in vastus lateralis muscles using 13C/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.RESULTSAthletes displayed a 25% greater (P < 0.05) insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate (Rd) than sedentary participants. During Intralipid infusion, insulin sensitivity remained higher in the athletes (ΔRd: 25 ± 3 vs. 17 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05), supported by higher glucose transporter type 4 protein expression than in sedentary humans. Compared to saline infusion, AUC of glucose-6-phosphate remained unchanged during Intralipid infusion in athletes (1.6 ± 0. mmol/L vs. 1.4 ± 0. [mmol/L] × h, P = n.s.) but tended to decrease by 36% in sedentary humans (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1 [mmol/L] × h, P < 0.059). This drop was accompanied by a 72% higher rate of net glycogen synthesis in the athletes upon Intralipid infusion (47 ± 9 vs. 13 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONAthletes feature higher skeletal muscle glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis during increased  availability, which primarily results from maintained insulin-stimulated glucose transport with increased myocellular glucose-6-phosphate levels for subsequent glycogen synthesis.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov .FUNDINGGerman Federal Ministry of Health (BMG).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655859>Deletion of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 knocks mitochondria down triggering metabolic rewiring in yeast.</a></h1><p>The Voltage-Dependent Anion-selective Channel (VDAC) is the pore-forming protein of mitochondrial outer membrane, allowing metabolites and ions exchanges. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete metabolic rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the glycolysis-derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate  droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol. Such unexpected re-arrangement of whole  suggests a regulatory role of VDAC1 in cell bioenergetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629366>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in adults: Current concepts in etiology, outcomes and management.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disease, extending from simple steatosis, through to inflammation and fibrosis with a significant risk for the development of cirrhosis.

We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and other  factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino acids and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve  of phospholipid , carnitine , and development of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652267>Comparative characterization of bacterial communities in geese consuming of different proportions of ryegrass.</a></h1><p>Geese are extremely well-adapted to utilizing plant-derived roughage in their diet, so the grass must be added to commercial diets under intensive rearing systems. However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.5:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = :1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut microbiota of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading microbiota such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut microbiota were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate  and amino acid  were dominant metabolic pathways.  was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal  deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading microbiota (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the  metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal  accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668688>Metabolomics of Aerobic Exercise in Chronic Stroke Survivors: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Understanding the  response to exercise may aid in optimizing stroke management. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate plasma metabolomic profiles in chronic stroke survivors following aerobic exercise training.Participants (age: 62 ± 1 years, body mass index: 31 ± 1 kg/m, mean ± standard error of the mean) were randomized to 6 months of treadmill exercise (N = 17) or whole-body stretching (N = 8) with preintervention and postintervention measurement of aerobic capacity (VOpeak). Linear models for microarray data expression analysis was performed to determine  changes over time, and Mummichog was used for pathway enrichment analysis following analysis of plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry.VOpeak change was greater following exercise than stretching (18.9% versus -.%; P < .01). Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites results showed significant enrichment in 4  following treadmill exercise, 3 of which (heparan-, chondroitin-, keratan-sulfate degradation) involved connective tissue  and the fourth involve lipid signaling (linoleate ). More  were altered in pre and post comparisons of stretching, including branched-chain amino acid, tryptophan, tyrosine, and urea cycle, which could indicate loss of lean body mass.These preliminary data show different  changes due to treadmill training and stretching in chronic stroke survivors and suggest that in addition to improved aerobic capacity, weight-bearing activity, like walking, could protect against loss of lean body mass. Future studies are needed to examine the relationship between changes in metabolomic profiles to reductions in cardiometabolic risk after treadmill rehabilitation.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651237>RNA-Seq based transcriptome analysis during bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) infection.</a></h1><p>Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is the member of the genus Pestivirus within the Flaviviridae family and responsible for severe economic losses in the cattle industry. BVDV can employ 'infect-and-persist' strategy and 'hit-and-run' strategy to remain associated with hosts and thus contributes to BVDV circulation in cattle herds. BVDV have also evolved various strategies to evade the innate immunity of host. To further understand the mechanisms by which BVDV overcomes the host cell innate immune response and provide more clues for further understanding the BVDV-host interaction, in this descriptive study, we conducted a investigation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the host during BVDV infection by RNA-Seq analysis.Our analysis identified 1297, 1732, 3072, and 1877 DEGs in the comparison groups mock vs. MDBK cells infected with BVDV post  h (MBV2h), mock vs. MBV6h, mock vs. MBV12h, and mock vs. MBV24h, respectively. The reproducibility and repeatability of the results were validated by RT-qPCR. Enrichment analyses of GO annotations and KEGG pathways revealed the host DEGs that are potentially induced by BVDV infection and may participate in BVDV-host interactions. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses identified the potential interactions among the DEGs. Our findings suggested that BVDV infection induced the upregulation of genes involved in . The expression of genes that have antiviral roles, including ISG15, Mx1, OSA1Y, were found to be downregulated and are thus potentially associated with the inhibition of host innate immune system during BVDV infection. The expression levels of F3, C1R, KNG1, CLU, C3, FB, SERPINA5, SERPINE1, C1S, F2RL2, and C2, which belong to the complement and coagulation signalling cascades, were downregulated during BVDV infection, which suggested that the complement system might play a crucial role during BVDV infection.In this descriptive study, our findings revealed the changes in the host transcriptome expression profile during BVDV infection and suggested that BVDV-infection induced altering the host's metabolic network, the inhibition of the expression of antiviral proteins and genes within the complement system might be contributed to BVDV proliferation. The above findings provided unique insights for further studies on the mechanisms underlying BVDV-host interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641636>Nonfunctioning and Subclinical Cortisol Secreting Adrenal Incidentalomas and their Association with Metabolic Syndrome: A Systematic Review.</a></h1><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that nonfunctioning and subclinical cortisol secreting adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) are associated with several components of metabolic syndrome resulting in increased cardiometabolic risk. The long-term metabolic outcome of these AIs is largely unknown and their most appropriate management remains controversial.To undertake a systematic review of the prevalence of cardiometabolic abnormalities in nonfunctioning and subclinical cortisol secreting AIs and long-term outcome of conservative treatment and adrenalectomy.MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and EMBASE were searched for relevant studies and systematic review was performed. National Institutes of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies was used to assess the risk of bias in the studies.Of the 65 studies screened, 18 (10 retrospective, 5 prospective,  cross-sectional studies, and 1 randomized controlled trial) were included in the systematic review. Prevalence of hypertension (HTN), impaired glucose , dyslipidaemia, and raised body mass index (BMI) was higher in subclinical cortisol secreting AIs as compared with nonfunctioning AIs. Surgical intervention had a beneficial effect on blood pressure, glucometabolic control, and obesity in patients with subclinical Cushing's syndrome. The results for  were equivocal. There was no significant improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors after adrenalectomy in nonfunctioning AIs. The quality of evidence was found to be low to moderate.The systematic review demonstrated increased prevalence of components of metabolic syndrome in patients with subclinical cortisol secreting and nonfunctioning AIs.

The goal of the current study was to investigate the short-term effects of continuous access to a high  diet (HFD) versus limited access to dietary  on the gustatory neural circuit. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a chow diet, a HFD (56% kcal from ), or provided limited, daily ( h/day) or limited, intermittent ( h/day, 3 times/week) access to vegetable shortening for  weeks. Real time PCR was used to determine mRNA expression of markers of  sensing/signaling (e.g. CD36) on the circumvallate papillae, markers of homeostatic eating in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) and markers of hedonic eating in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Continuous HFD increased mRNA levels of lingual CD36 and serotonin signaling, altered markers of homeostatic and hedonic eating. Limited, intermittent access to dietary  selectively altered the expression of genes associated with the regulation of dopamine signaling. Overall, these data suggest that short-term, continuous access to HFD leads to altered  taste and decreased expression of markers of homeostatic and hedonic eating. Limited, intermittent access, or binge-like, consumption of dietary  led to an overall increase in markers of hedonic eating, without altering expression of lingual  sensors or homeostatic eating. These data suggest that there are differential effects of meal patterns on gustatory neurocircuitry which may regulate the overconsumption of  and lead to obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although estimating the VFA by X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the primary index for visceral obesity, it is expensive and requires invasive radiation exposure. Dual bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a simple and reliable method to estimate VFA; however, the clinical usefulness of dual BIA remains unclear in patients with type  diabetes (T2D).We estimated the VFAs by dual BIA and CT in 98 patients with T2D and assessed anthropometric parameters, blood test results, and the presence of comorbid hypertension and dyslipidemia. We compared the correlation between the VFAs examined by dual BIA and CT. Furthermore, we performed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses for the VFAs to detect the presence of comorbid hypertension and/or dyslipidemia with T2D, which are major comorbidities of visceral obesity, and estimated the area under the curve (AUC).The measurement error between the VFAs by dual BIA and CT was significantly higher among patients with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥ 100 pg/mL than those with BNP < 100 pg/mL (39.% ± 31.1% vs. 24.1% ± 18.6%, P < 0.05). After excluding patients with BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL, the VFA by dual BIA significantly correlated with the VFA by CT (r = 0.917; P < 0.0001). The AUC in the ROC analysis for the VFA by dual BIA to detect the presence of comorbid hypertension and/or dyslipidemia with T2D was almost equivalent to that for the VFA by CT.In patients with T2D without elevated BNP > 100 pg/mL as indicator for fluid accumulation interfering with BIA, estimation of the VFA by dual BIA significantly correlated with that by CT and also detected comorbid hypertension and/or dyslipidemia with T2D equivalent to those detected by CT. Hence, dual BIA could be an alternative to CT as a standard method for estimating the VFA in patients with diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599971>Effect of the Incorporation of Amaranth (Amaranthus Mantegazzianus) into - and Cholesterol-Rich Diets for Wistar Rats.</a></h1><p>The hypocholesterolemic effect of amaranth was studied in male Wistar rats fed a high- diet that was supplemented with amaranth flour, AF, or isolated protein, AI. Likewise, an in vitro test was carried out, in which the capacity of the AI, AF, the digested isolate, DAI, and the digested amaranth flour, DAF, to displace the cholesterol of the model micelles was evaluated. The in vivo results showed an increase in the excretion of cholesterol through feces (77% for AF7; 23% and 108% for AI30 and AF30, respect control) and a decrease in the content of hepatic cholesterol (98% for AF7; 96% and 53% for AI30 and AF30 respect control); whereas in vitro it was shown that both AF and DAF have greater power to displace cholesterol than the AI and DAI (IC 0.1, 0.71, 0., and .1 for AF, DAF, AI, and DAI, respectively).

REE by indirect calorimetry; skeletal muscle (SM), trunk organs, and brain volumes by MRI; and FFM by DXA were measured at post-surgery visits and compared with CON (N = 84) using linear regression models that adjusted for relevant covariates. Ns in RYGB were 50, 42, and 30 for anthropometry and 39, 27, 17 for MRI body composition at years 1, , and 5 after surgery, respectively.Regression models adjusted for age, weight, height, ethnicity, and sex showed REE differences (RYGB minus CON; mean ± s.e.): year 1 (43. ± 34 kcal/day, p = 0.20); year  (- 27.9 ± 37.3 kcal/day, p = 0.46); year 5 (114.6 ± 42.3 kcal/day, p = 0.008). Analysis of FFM components showed that RYGB had greater trunk organ mass (~ 0.4 kg) and less SM (~ 1.34 kg) than CON at each visit. REE models adjusted for FFM, SM, trunk organs, and brain mass showed no between-group differences in REE (- 15.9 ± 54.8 kcal/day, p = 0.8; - 46.9 ± 64.9 kcal/day, p = 0.47; 47.7 ± 83.0 kcal/day, p = 0.57, at years 1, , and 5, respectively).Post bariatric surgery patients maintain a larger mass of high-metabolic rate trunk organs than non-operated controls of similar anthropometrics.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that Wingless type 5a (Wnt5a) is implicated in cardiovascular diseases through non-canonical Wnt cascades. However, its precise role during the pathogenesis of AS is still unclear. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the role and the underlying mechanism of Wnt5a/receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor  (Ror2) pathways in the promotion of AS process through affecting  accumulation and inflammation. In atherosclerotic clinical samples, Wnt5a levels were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. In vivo experiments were conducted by using apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE) mice model. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were applied for in vitro studies. Wnt5a was highly expressed in both of atherosclerotic clinical samples and apoE mice. The knockdown of Wnt5a significantly inhibited cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Additionally, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation aggravated the cholesterol accumulation and decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression in VSMCs. Depletion of intracellular cholesterol by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) led to the upregulation of ABCA1 and the inhibition of inflammation. Conversely, the overexpression of Wnt5a inhibited ABCA1 expression, facilitated cholesterol accumulation, impared cholesterol efflux, promoted NF-κB nuclear translocation and the inflammatory cytokines secretion. Moreover, the knockdown of Ror2 increased ABCA1 expression and reduced Wnt5a-induced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the knockdown of ABCA1 enhanced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Therefore, Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway was critical in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response, which might be a promising therapeutic target for AS therapy.Copyright © 2019.

As a novel adipocytokine, Chemerin not only plays a pivotal role in physiological and pathological processes such as immune response and , but is also involved in the regulation of programmed cell death, including autophagy and apoptosis. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate whether autophagy and apoptosis of bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) was triggered by Chemerin. BMECs were cultured and treated with Chemerin in vitro. The expression of autophagosome-forming marker, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 II (LC3-II) and sequestosome-1 (SQSTM 1, best known as p62), a substrate of autophagosome degradation were detected. The result showed that Chemerin significantly decreased the expression of p62 and markedly induced the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. The ratio of Bcl2-associated X and B-cell lymphoma- (Bax/Bcl-) and the activity of caspase-3 were up-regulated after being treated by Chemerin, and the apoptotic rate was also significantly increased. These results suggested that Chemerin promoted the occurrence of autophagy and apoptosis in BMECs. Chloroquine (CQ), which is an inhibitor of autophagy. To explore effects of Chemerin on apoptosis, we prevented Chemerin-induced autophagy by pre-adding CQ in BMECs. Interestingly, this part of the experiment helped us find that all effects of Chemerin on apoptosis of BMECs could be enhanced with the inhibition of autophagy. Our study demonstrates that Chemerin-induced autophagy and apoptosis are mutually regulated in BMECs, but the specific mechanism remains to be further researched.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648945>Structural analyses of inositol phosphate second messengers bound to signaling effector proteins.</a></h1><p>The higher-order inositol phosphate second messengers inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP4), inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) are important signaling molecules that regulate DNA-damage repair, cohesin dynamics, RNA-editing, retroviral assembly, nuclear transport, phosphorylation, acetylation, crotonylation, and ubiquitination. This functional diversity has made understanding how inositol polyphosphates regulate cellular processes challenging to dissect. However, some inositol phosphates have been unexpectedly found in X-ray crystal structures, occasionally revealing structural and mechanistic details of effector protein regulation before functional consequences have been described. This review highlights a sampling of crystal structures describing the interaction between inositol phosphates and protein effectors. This list includes the RNA editing enzyme "adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA " (ADAR2), the Pds5B regulator of cohesin dynamics, the class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC1 and HDAC3, and the PH domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). One of the most important enzymes responsible for higher-order inositol phosphate synthesis is inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), which plays dual roles in both inositol and phosphoinositide signaling. Structures of phosphoinositide  binding proteins have also revealed new aspects of protein effector regulation, as mediated by the nuclear receptors Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1, NR5A2) and Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2). Together, these studies underscore the structural diversity in binding interactions between effector proteins and inositol phosphate small signaling molecules, and further support that detailed structural studies can lead to new biological discovery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Fenugreek is a well-known hypocholesterolaemic agent with amazing phytochemical composition. Due to its impact on plant , CO enrichment was tested as a strategy to support functional values in fenugreek seeds. Phytochemical composition and biological activities of three fenugreek cultivars (G2, G6 and G30) grown under ambient (aCO, 400 μmol mol) and elevated CO (eCO, 620 μmol mol) were assessed. Applying eCO improved physical parameters of fenugreek seeds, and enhanced their biological activities. A significant increase in hypocholesterolaemic potential, as indicated by inhibition of cholesterol micellar solubility and pancreatic lipase activity, was recorded. In addition, antioxidant, anti- peroxidation and antibacterial activities were improved. These enhanced biological activities were accompanied by improved seed chemical composition at the primary and secondary metabolic levels. Therefore, eCO treatment represents an efficient strategy to increase the hypocholesterolaemic, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of fenugreek seeds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we demonstrate that DHA, but not arachidonic acid (ARA), suppressed oligomeric amyloid-β peptide (oAβ)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in primary mouse microglia and immortalized mouse microglia (BV2). Similarly, DHA but not ARA suppressed oAβ-induced increases in phosphorylated cytosolic phospholipase A (p-cPLA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in BV2 cells. LC-MS/MS assay indicated the ability for DHA to cause an increase in 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) and suppress oAβ-induced increase in 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Although oAβ did not alter the nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (Nrf2) pathway, exogenous DHA, ARA as well as low concentrations of 4-HHE and 4-HNE upregulated this pathway and increased production of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in microglial cells. These results suggest that DHA modulates ARA  in oAβ-stimulated microglia through suppressing oxidative and inflammatory pathways and upregulating the antioxidative stress pathway involving Nrf2/HO-1.

Stratified cluster sampling was used to select 17,007 participants (5971 with biochemical indexes available) aged 6-12 years on two avenues per region in urban, suburban, and rural areas. The prevalence of hypertension was 12.55%; children with obesity combined with rural residence, low family income, birth weight (<3000 g) (BWP) or >10 months of breastfeeding had a significantly elevated prevalence of hypertension (37.06%, 30.41%, 30.04%, and 30.84%, respectively). Obesity and heart rate were the significant anthropometric determinants; gestational hypertension, BWP25 and >10 months of breastfeeding were the significant perinatal determinants; rural residence was the significant socioeconomic determinant; fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were the significant serum biochemical determinants; and red blood cell counts and platelet counts were the significant haematological determinants of childhood hypertension. The adjusted R values were 14.45% and 24.88% in the full models excluding and including serum indexes, respectively. We observed a notable prevalence of hypertension in a large paediatric sample.

Seventeen randomized placebo controlled PCSK9 inhibitor trials were included, providing data on 79,578 participants. Results were scaled to a one mmol/L lower LDL-C concentration.The PCSK9 GS (comprising 4 SNPs) associations with plasma  and apolipoprotein levels were consistent in direction with treatment effects. The GS odds ratio (OR) for myocardial infarction (MI) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.42; 0.68), compared to a PCSK9 inhibitor effect of 0.90 (95% CI 0.86; 0.93). For ischemic stroke ORs were 0.84 (95% CI 0.57; 1.22) for the GS, compared to 0.85 (95% CI 0.78; 0.93) in the drug trials.

After 6 mice with low body weight were removed from the study, the remaining 24 mice were fed with a normal- diet (NFD; 10% energy from , n = 12) or an HFD (60% energy from , n = 12) for 24 wk. At the end of the experiment, serum glucose and  concentrations were measured, and skeletal muscle was collected for atrophy analysis, inflammation measurements, and phosphoproteomic analysis.Compared with the NFD, the HFD increased (P < 0.05) body weight (35.8%), serum glucose (64.5%), and  (27.3%) concentrations, along with elevated (P < 0.05) expressions of the atrophy-related proteins muscle ring finger 1 (MURF1; 27.6%) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFBX; 44.5%) in skeletal muscle. Phosphoproteomic analysis illustrated 64 proteins with differential degrees of phosphorylation between the HFD and NFD groups. These proteins were mainly involved in modulating cytoskeleton [adenylyl cyclase-associated protein  (CAP2) and actin-α skeletal muscle (ACTA1)], inflammation [NF-κB-activating protein (NKAP) and serine/threonine-protein kinase RIO3 (RIOK3)], glucose  [Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (TRIP10); protein kinase C, and casein kinase II substrate protein 3 (PACSIN3)], and protein degradation [heat shock protein 90 kDa (HSP90AA1)]. The HFD-induced inhibitions of the insulin signaling pathway and activations of inflammation in skeletal muscle were verified by Western blot analysis.Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis in C57BL/6 J mice fed an NFD or HFD for 24 wk revealed that the phosphorylation of inflammatory proteins and proteins associated with glucose  at specific serine residues may play critical roles in the regulation of skeletal muscle atrophy induced by an HFD. This work provides information regarding underlying molecular mechanisms for inflammation-induced dysfunction and atrophy in skeletal muscle.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620810>Sex-specific initiation rates of tobacco smoking and its determinants among adults from a Middle Eastern population: a cohort study.</a></h1><p>To assess the initiation rate and determinants of tobacco smoking among adults.In the Tehran  and Glucose Study, a population-based cohort from Iran, 6101 participants ≥ 18 years old who had never smoked tobacco at baseline (phase II: 2002-2006) were followed until phase VI (2015-2018). Sex-specific initiation rates per 1000 person-years for self-reported tobacco smoking and hazard ratios (HR) for its potential determinants (using Cox proportional hazards models) were calculated.The age- and sex-adjusted smoking initiation rate was 13.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.59-14.94] per 1000 person-years, of which 78% was attributed to water pipe use. Initiation rate was remarkably higher among men [19.1 (16.9-21.)] than women [8.3 (7.4-9.)] and declined in older age-groups. Among both genders, being married was protective [men: HR 0.67 (CI 95% 0.48-0.92); women: 0.58 (0.45-0.74)], while intermediate-level education (compared with high level) [men: 1.61 (1.14-.26); women: 1.33 (0.95-1.84, p value = 0.092)] and passive smoking [men: 1.76 (1.36-.28); women: 1.82 (1.42-.33)] increased the risk. Educational intervention decreased the risk among women [0.74 (0.58-0.94)].The majority of adult smoking initiators started smoking with water pipe.

We assessed the effects of tesamorelin on liver  and histology in people with HIV and NAFLD.This randomised, double-blind, multicentre study with identical placebo as a comparator was done in a hospital and a medical research centre in the USA. People with HIV infection and a hepatic  fraction (HFF) of 5% or more by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either tesamorelin  mg once daily or placebo once daily for 12 months, followed by a 6-month open-label phase during which all participants received tesamorelin  mg daily. The randomisation list was prepared by the study statistician using a permuted block algorithm within each stratum with randomly varying block sizes. The primary endpoint was change in HFF between baseline and 12 months. The primary safety endpoint was glucose. Analysis was by intention to treat using all available data. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .61 patients were enrolled between Aug 20, 2015, and Jan 16, 2019, of whom 30 received tesamorelin and 30 received placebo. Patients receiving tesamorelin had a greater reduction of HFF than did patients receiving placebo, with an absolute effect size of -4·1% (95% CI -7·6 to -0·7, p=0·018), corresponding to a -37% (95% CI -67 to -7, p=0·016) relative reduction from baseline. After 12 months, 35% of individuals receiving tesamorelin and 4% receiving placebo had a HFF of less than 5% (p=0·0069). Changes in fasting glucose and glycated haemoglobin were not different between groups at 12 months. Individuals in the tesamorelin group experienced more localised injection site complaints than those in the placebo group, though none were judged to be serious.Tesamorelin might be beneficial in people with HIV and NAFLD.

We tested how a graded reduction in insulin impacts the source of FA used by cardiomyocytes and the cardiac adaptations required to process these FA. Methods and Results Rats injected with 55 (D55) or 100 (D100) mg/kg streptozotocin were terminated after 4 days. Although D55 and D100 were equally hyperglycemic, D100 showed markedly lower pancreatic and plasma insulin and loss of lipoprotein lipase, which in D55 hearts had expanded. There was minimal change in plasma FA in D55. However, D100 exhibited a - to 3-fold increase in various saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA in the plasma. D100 demonstrated dramatic cardiac transcriptomic changes with 1574 genes differentially expressed compared with only 49 in D55. Augmented mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation in D100 was not matched by elevated tricarboxylic acid or oxidative phosphorylation. With increasing FA, although control myocytes responded by augmenting basal respiration, this was minimized in D55 and reversed in D100. Metabolomic profiling identified significant lipid accumulation in D100 hearts, which also exhibited sizeable change in genes related to apoptosis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells. Conclusions With increasing severity of diabetes mellitus, when the diabetic heart is unable to control its own FA supply using lipoprotein lipase, it undergoes dramatic reprogramming that is linked to handling of excess FA that arise from adipose tissue. This transition results in a cardiac  signature that embraces mitochondrial FA overload, oxidative stress, triglyceride storage, and cell death.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654570>Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction via regulation of AMPK signaling and .</a></h1><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is known as a potent metabolic regulator but its protective mechanisms against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet  in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high- diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced  accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation and reduced  deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell  accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high- diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10). Liver histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with fatty acid with or without myriocin treatment.  accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults, liver biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and liver biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated body weight and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated liver pathology including steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of fatty acid  associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced NASH, and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in NASH patients as compared to the controls and non-NASH patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hence, blockade of ceramide signaling by myriocin may be of therapeutically beneficial in NASH.Registration ID: ChiCTR-DDT-13003983 .

Although the mechanisms involved are likely complex, these associations suggest that lowering circulating ceramide levels could be protective against cardiovascular diseases. Conversely, dietary fibers, such as inulin, have been reported to promote cardiovascular and metabolic health. However, the mechanisms involved in these protective processes also are not well understood. We studied the effects of inulin on  with a model of atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient mice using lipidomics and transcriptomics. Plasma and tissues were collected at 10 days and/or 12 weeks after feeding mice an atherogenic diet supplemented with inulin or cellulose (control). Compared with controls, inulin-fed mice displayed a decreased C16:0/C24:0 plasma ceramide ratio and lower levels of circulating ceramides associated with VLDL and LDL. Liver transcriptomic analysis revealed that Smpd3, a gene that encodes neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase), was downregulated by -fold in inulin-fed mice. Hepatic NSMase activity was 3-fold lower in inulin-fed mice than in controls. Furthermore, liver redox status and compositions of phosphatidylserine and free fatty acid species, the major factors that determine NSMase activity, also were modified by inulin. Taken together, these results showed that, in mice, inulin can decrease plasma ceramide levels through reductions in NSMase expression and activity, suggesting a mechanism by which fiber could reduce cardiometabolic disease risk.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615062>Acetate Affects the Process of  in Rabbit Liver, Skeletal Muscle and Adipose Tissue.</a></h1><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (a microbial fermentation production in the rabbit gut) have an important role in many physiological processes, which may be related to the reduced body  of rabbits.

Ninety rabbits (40 days of age) were randomly divided into three groups: a sham control group (injection of saline for four days); a group experiencing subcutaneous injection of acetate for four days ( g/kg BM per day, one injection each day, acetate); and a pair-fed sham treatment group. The results show that acetate-inhibited  accumulation by promoting lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation and inhibiting fatty acid synthesis. Activated G protein-coupled receptor 41/43, adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/ signal pathways were likely to participate in the regulation in  accumulation of acetate. Acetate reduced hepatic triglyceride content by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis, enhancing fatty acid oxidation and  output. Inhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α () and activated AMPK and ERK1/ signal pathways were related to the process in liver. Acetate reduced intramuscular triglyceride level via increasing fatty acid uptake and fatty acid oxidation.

All the synthesized compounds were preliminarily screened by using the Triton WR-1339-induecd hyperlipidemia model, in which T1 exhibited more potent hypolipidemic property than positive drug fenofibrate (FF). T1 also significantly decreased serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterin (LDL) in methionine solution (Mets) induced hyperlipidemic mice. Moreover, hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) were obviously ameliorated after treatment with T1 and the histological observation indicated that T1 ameliorated the injury in liver tissue and inhibited the hepatic  accumulation. In the livers of T1-administrated rat, the levels of PPARα related to lipids  were up-regulated. Additional effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and HS releasing action confirmed and reinforced the activity of T1 as a potential multifunctional hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective agent.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

SCFAs are known to improve host  but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL,  mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of  related stearic acid and glycerol--phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic acid, fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic acid; and decreased levels of the amino acid  products aspartic acid and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited fatty acid synthesis and promoted  metabolic process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased glycolysis.

This study assessed the trend of esophageal cancer mortality in Serbia.A population-based study analyzing esophageal cancer mortality in Serbia in the period 1991-2015 was carried out based on official data. The annual percentage of change (APC), with the 95% confidence interval (CI), was computed using the joinpoint regression analysis. The age, period and birth cohort effects on the mortality from esophageal cancer were examined using the age-period-cohort analysis.In Serbia, esophageal cancer mortality trend significantly increased from 1991 to 2015 in men (APC=+0.9%, 95%CI=0.3 to 1.4), but nonsignificantly increased in women (APC=+0.4%, 95%CI=-0.6 to 1.4). The age-specific mortality rates were increasing with age, but this trend has only been significant in men in the 50-59 years age group (APC = +1.5%, 95%CI= 0.8 to .3).

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the metabolic effects of PRL on glucose homeostasis in men with T2DM.Eighty male patients with T2DM compared with 25 male healthy controls matched with patients for age and weight were divided into four groups: Group (A): patients with T2DM on metformin ( = 29), Group (B): patients with T2DM on glyburide ( = 30), Group (C): patients with T2DM on glyburide plus metformin ( = 21), and Group (D): healthy male subjects as control ( = 25). Body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure measurements were determined. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, atherogenic index, fasting serum insulin, insulin resistance (IR), and β-cell function of the pancreas were determined by homeostatic model assessment- (HOMA-IR). Furthermore, C-reactive protein and PRL serum level were determined in patients with T2DM and healthy control men.BMI of T2DM patients was higher as compared with control ( = 0.003). Combination therapy (glyburide plus metformin) in patients with T2DM showed better effect on most of glycemic indices and  profile than glyburide or metformin monotherapy ( < 0.05). PRL serum level was higher in patients with T2DM as compared with control ( = 0.001). PRL serum level was high in glyburide-treated patients as compared with metformin-treated patients ( = 0.002).This study concludes that elevated PRL serum level in patients with T2DM is associated with diabetic complications. Diabetic pharmacotherapy mainly metformin reduced PRL serum level in patients with T2DM through amelioration of IR.Copyright: © 2019 International Journal of Critical Illness and Injury Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677208>β-cell Function, Incretin Response, and Insulin Sensitivity of Glucose and  in Obese Youth: Relationship to OGTT Time to Glucose Peak.</a></h1><p>In adults, the time to glucose peak at or after 30 min during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) identifies physiologically distinct groups with differences in insulin sensitivity, β-cell function and risk for type  diabetes. In obese non-diabetic adolescents, we investigated if the OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak also reflects incretin and free fatty acid (FFA) responses besides insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, measured by the clamp.Obese adolescents (n=278) were categorized according to their OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak by Early-peak (at 30 min) vs. Late-peak (>30 min) groups. Body composition, visceral adipose tissue, oral disposition index (oDI) and OGTT-area under the curve (AUC) were examined. A subset of 102 participants had both hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps to measure in vivo insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity.Compared with the Early-peak group, the Late-peak group had impaired β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, lower glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)-AUC, and higher FFA-AUC despite higher insulin and C-peptide-AUC. They also had lower hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity despite similar percent body  and visceral adipose tissue, and had higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (all P<0.05).In obese non-diabetic youth, those with a Late-peak vs. an Early-peak glucose during an OGTT showed diminished β-cell function, blunted incretin secretion, and lower insulin sensitivity of glucose and FFA .

The aberrantly expressed methylation‑driven genes in HCC and normal tissues were identified using the Limma package and the MethylMix algorithm. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and ConsensusPathDB were used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and pathway analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to construct a prognostic risk model of HCC. Survival curve and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the clinical utility of the risk model. A total of 238 methylation‑driven genes were successfully identified from cancer and normal tissues. GO enrichment analysis indicated that these genes functioned in the extracellular space, interfering with  in hepatocytes and regulating adaptive immune responses. In total, 14 relevant pathways were identified. The following prognostic risk model was generated: Risk score=CALML3 (degree of methylation) x (‑4.860) + CCNI2 x (.071) + TNFRSF12A x (‑3.369) + IFITM1 x (1.203) + ENPP7P13 x (‑1.366) + DDT x (.139) + RASAL2‑AS1 x (‑1.384) + ANKRD22 x (‑3.215). The median risk score (0.970) derived from this model was set as cutoff value for assigning patients to high‑ or low‑risk group. The 5‑year survival rate was 35.8% [95% confidence interval (CI)=27.1‑47.4%] in the high‑risk group and 61.7% (95% CI=51.4‑74.%) in the low‑risk group (P<0.0001). The ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0.742, indicating that this model is appropriate for predicting the survival rate of patients. Furthermore, the methylation and expression levels of two key genes, tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 12A and D‑dopachrome decarboxylase, were significantly associated with prognosis and were correlated with cg00510447, cg26808293, cg11060661 and cg16132339 methylation. In conclusion, a prognostic risk model for HCC is proposed based on the bioinformatic analysis of methylation‑driven genes.

EETs elicit endothelial angiogenic activity linked to tumor growth in various cancer models that can be attenuated in vivo by COX- inhibitors. This study further defines the relationship between endothelial EET  and COX- in promoting angiogenesis. Using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), we quantified 8,9-EET-induced tube formation and cell migration as indicators of angiogenic potential, in the presence and absence of a COX- inducer (PDBu). Although PDBu itself was potent in increasing angiogenic markers, 8,9-EET in combination with PDBu elicited a 1.3-fold larger response than 8,9-EET alone, and compared to PDBu. Contributing to this response were 8,9-EET metabolites formed from COX-, the 11-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,11-EHET) and 15-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,15-EHET). When exogenously dosed into HAEC, synthetic 8,9,11-EHET enhanced angiogenesis at all concentrations tested, whereas 8,9,15-EHET was inactive. Tube formation by 8,9,11-EHET was independent of PI3K-Akt, p38 MAPK, and MEK signaling. These results indicate that 8,9-EET-stimulated angiogenesis is enhanced by COX-  in endothelium through formation of 8,9,11-EHET. This  mediator may play a role in regulating physiological angiogenesis, and it may be especially important under circumstances where COX- is induced, such as in cancer tumor growth and inflammation. Finally, the generation of 8, 9, 11-EHET from 8, 9-EET may help explain why EETs are weakly angiogenic under some conditions yet block tumor growth under other conditions.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648012>Recombinant buckwheat trypsin inhibitor decreases  accumulation via the IIS pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h1><p>Buckwheat trypsin inhibitor (BTI) is a low molecular weight polypeptide that can help to prevent metabolic diseases such as obesity, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Herein, the effects of recombinant BTI (rBTI) on  accumulation in Caenorhabditis elegans were studied. rBTI prevented  accumulation under normal and high glucose conditions, and led to significantly shorter body widths without affecting C. elegans feeding behavior. Results also indicate that rBTI altered  breakdown, synthesis, and accumulation by altering the transcription, expression and activity of key enzymes in lipolysis and  synthesis. In daf- and daf-16 mutants, rBTI did not prevent  accumulation, indicating that rBTI activity relies on the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IIS) pathway. Overall rBTI may regulate changes in lipolysis and  synthesis by down-regulating the IIS pathway, which can affect  accumulation. These findings support the application of rBTI in preventing obesity, hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Six dairy cows were sampled during transition period to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome changes and its relationship with blood biomarkers. Blood samples were collected at - 20 ± , - 3 ± 1, 3, and 7 days from parturition (DFP). Leukocyte transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing technology (Hiseq1000 Illumina, USA). Plasma was analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to run an enrichment analysis through the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). Considering - 20 DFP as references time, the main KEGG impacted pathways were activated before calving (- 3 DFP) and were connected to ,  transport in plasma, and phagosome. The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to immunity and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to  and amino acid  were inhibited.

Body composition was evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Skeletal muscle index, calculated as appendicular non- mass (kg) divided by height squared (m ), was used to determine sarcopenia. Sarcopenic obesity was defined as the coexistence of sarcopenia and a ratio of android to gynoid  mass greater than the median values in each gender. The association of sarcopenic obesity both with the annual rate of decline in estimated GFR and a >30% decline in estimated GFR was evaluated using multivariate linear regression models and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively.Participants with sarcopenic obesity were at an increased risk of a high annual rate of decline in estimated GFR, even after adjustment for the confounding variables (standardized β = -0.228, P <0.001). Sarcopenic obesity was also significantly associated with risk of a >30% decline in estimated GFR (hazard ratio 4.52, 95% CI .16-9.47; P < 0.01) in multivariate model.Sarcopenic obesity evaluated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry is associated with a faster decline in renal function in people with type  diabetes.© 2019 Diabetes UK.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618976>The Potential of the FSP1cre- Mouse Model for Studying Juvenile NAFLD.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can progress from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) characterized by liver inflammation, possibly leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mice with impaired macrophage activation, when fed a high- diet, develop severe NASH. Evidence is mounting that Kupffer cells are implicated. However, it is unknown whether the resident CD68 or bone marrow-derived CD11b Kupffer cells are involved. Characterization of the FSP1cre-Pparb/d mouse liver revealed that FSP1 is expressed in CD11b Kupffer cells. Although these cells only constitute a minute fraction of the liver cell population,  deletion in these cells led to remarkable hepatic phenotypic changes. We report that a higher  content was present in postnatal day  (P2) FSP1cre- livers, which diminished after weaning. Quantification of total lipids and triglycerides revealed that P2 and week 4 of age FSP1cre- livers have higher levels of both. qPCR analysis also showed upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, and fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis pathways. This result is further supported by western blot analysis of proteins in these pathways. Hence, we propose that FSP1cre- mice, which accumulate lipids in their liver in early life, may represent a useful animal model to study juvenile NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614355>Chronic Kidney Disease Is Associated with Increased Plasma Levels of Fibroblast Growth Factors 19 and 21.</a></h1><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the result of a reduced number of nephrons, in which adipose tissue and its metabolites play a significant role.

The aim of the study was to examine the concentrations of FGF19 and FGF21 in patients with CKD, as well as the correlation between FGF19 and FGF21 and selected biochemical parameters.The study included 178 subjects: 52 patients with CKD in stages -4, without haemodialysis (CKD), 47 haemodialysed patients with CKD (HD), 56 patients with CKD after a renal transplantation (Tx) and 23 healthy subjects as the control group (C).The highest FGF19 serum concentrations were observed in CKD patients and the lowest were observed in the Tx group. Patients in the CKD group had significantly higher serum FGF21 concentrations. There were negative correlations between FGF19 and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as well as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients after kidney transplantation. Negative correlations were also found between serum FGF21 concentrations and GFR in patients after Tx, while positive correlations were observed between FGF21 concentrations and lean body mass in the CKD group, body mass index and total cholesterol in the HD group.Our results suggest that increased concentrations of FGF19 and FGF21 in patients with CKD may be associated with the  of lipids and carbohydrates. Our results also indicate that haemodialysis and transplantation results in the reduction of FGF19 and FGF21 concentrations in patients with CKD.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Although deregulated metabolic pathways have been implicated in HCC onset and progression, the mechanisms triggering this metabolic imbalance are yet to be explored. Here, we identified a gene signature coding catabolic enzymes (Cat-GS) involved in key metabolic pathways like amino acid, , carbohydrate, drug, and retinol  as suppressed in HCC. A higher expression of deregulated Cat-GS is associated with good survival and less aggressive disease state in HCC patients. On the other hand, we identified mTOR signaling as a key determinant in HCC onset and progression, whose hyperactivation is found associated with poor survival and aggressive disease state in HCC patients. Next, out of Cat-GS, we established two key regulators of alcohol , alcohol dehydrogenase 1A (ADH1A) and aldehyde dehydrogenase  (ALDH2), as being transcriptionally suppressed by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) at the downstream of mTORC1 signaling. Suppressed ADH1A and ALDH2 expression aligns well with HCC-specific molecular profile and can efficiently predict disease onset and progression, whereas higher ADH1A and ALDH2 expression is associated with good survival and less aggressive disease state in HCC patients. Overall, our  findings suggest that transcriptional suppression of alcohol  regulators, ADH1A and ALDH2, at the downstream of mTOR signaling is, in part, responsible for triggering oncogenic transformation of hepatocytes resulting in disease onset and progression in HCC.Copyright © 2019 Zahid, Yao, Khan, Raza and Gou.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606962>Elevated Expression of Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 Delta Is Associated with  Dysregulation during Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression.</a></h1><p>Liver cancer is the third rank amongst the common malignancies, causing maximum death in the patients diagnosed with cancers. Currently available biomarkers are not enough sensitive for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This makes difficult management of HCC. With the aim of finding new generation of proteomic-based biomarkers, the represented study was designed to characterize the differentially expressed proteins at different stages of HCC initiation and at progression. This could lead to find potential biomarkers for early detection of HCC.In this experimental study, we report induction of HCC by administrating chemical carcinogens in male Wistar rats. Disease progression was monitored by histological evaluation. Serum proteomic analyses such as  dimensional (2D)-electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF-MS/MS and Western blot have been used to analyze and characterize the differentially expressed proteins during HCC development.HCC initiation and tumorigenesis were observed at one and four months post carcinogen treatment, respectively. One of the differentially-expressed proteins, namely, cytosolic phospholipase A2 delta was significantly up-regulated at very early stage of HCC development. Its expression continued to increase during cancer progression and hepatotumorigenesis stages. Its elevated expression has been confirmed by Western blot analysis. Consistent to this, analyses of the sera in the clinically confirmed liver cancer patients showed elevated expression of this protein, further validating our experimental results.This study suggests that elevation in the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 delta is associated with progression of HCC.Copyright© by Royan Institute.

Participants completed a submaximal incremental exercise test to determine their  and carbohydrate oxidation rates.The relative oxygen volume (VO ) peak was significantly higher in the control group than in the survivors of childhood brain tumors (43.3 ± 11.9 and 32.4 ± 10. mL/kg /min, P = .04). At the same relative exercise intensity, there was no difference in the carbohydrate or  oxidation rate between the two groups, or in the maximal  oxidation (MFO) rate, or in the heart rate or percentage of VO peak to reach MFO. Healthy children achieved MFO at significantly higher muscular power than did brain tumor survivors (47.9 ± 20.8 and 21.8 ± 9.6 W, P = .003).Because child brain tumor survivors are less physically fit than healthy children, and substrate utilization during submaximal exercise is not different, physical activity should be promoted for child brain tumor survivors.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606252>Silica nanoparticles exacerbates reproductive toxicity development in high- diet-treated Wistar rats.</a></h1><p>To demonstrate the combined adverse effect and the mechanism of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) with 57.66 ± 7.30 nm average diameter and high- diet (HFD) on Wistar rats, 60 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 10): Control group, SiNPs group, HFD group,  mg kg SiNPs + HFD group, 5 mg kg SiNPs + HFD group and 10 mg kg SiNPs + HFD group. HFD was administrated for  weeks for the rats in advance and SiNPs were supplied every 3 d for 48 d subsequently. The present study illustrated that both HFD and SiNPs could decrease sperm concentration, mobility rates, increase abnormality rates, damage testicular structure, reduce spermatogonium numbers and spermatoblast numbers, reduce ATP levels, and affect expression of regulatory factors for meiosis in testis. HFD and SiNPs further damaged the sperm and lowered the ATP level and expression of factors associated with meiotic signaling pathway compared with the HFD without SiNPs in testicular tissue of Wistar rats. These results suggested that SiNPs significantly promoted reproductive toxicity induced by HFD in Wistar rats, which provides novel experimental evidence and an explanation for magnified reproductive toxicity triggered by SiNPs in HFD rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

NEGT4 contained 7 mg of drug in 10% w/w distilled water, 30% w/w surfactant (Labrafil M) and cosurfactant (Transcutol P) mixture in ratio 1:4 and 60 % Capryol 90 as oily phase thickened with 98.9 mg ethyl cellulose (20 cps). In vivo studies were carried out on male Wistar rats following standard guidelines. Scopolamine was used to induce amnesia in rats which is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Various formulations were compared by performing pharmacokinetic, histopathological, behavioural and biochemical studies on rats. Stability studies on nanoemulsion gels were carried out in accordance with The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines.Pharmacokinetic studies exhibited significantly greater extent of absorption from NEGT4 in comparison to capsule and hydrogel with a .18 & 5.26-fold increase respectively. Significant improvement in neurobehavioral parameters was observed with NEGT4 in scopolamine-induced amnesic rats. Biochemical assessment showed superior anti-amnesic activity of NEGT4 through augmentation of antioxidant enzymes, decreased  peroxidation & acetylcholinesterase activity. Low value of serum aminotransferase in rats treated with NEGT4 indicated absence of hepatotoxicity. NEGT4 was found to be non-irritant and possessed a shelf life of 4.11 years.Developed nanoemulsion gel of tacrine hydrochloride was found to be safe, stable, and efficacious and has immense potential to be used in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663569>Daily consumption of fruit-flavored yoghurt enriched with vitamins B contributes to lower energy intake and body weight reduction, in type  diabetic patients: a randomized clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Yoghurt naturally contains vitamins of B-complex which play a central role in energy . This study investigates the effects of consumption of yoghurt enriched with vitamins B, in comparison with conventional yoghurt, on body weight management and glycemic control of patients with Type  Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Thirty-three overweight/obese patients (BMI 27-36 kg m-) were randomized into two groups receiving two servings of non- yoghurt per day, either strawberry-flavored enriched with vitamins B1, B5 and B6 (VY) or conventional (CY) for 12 weeks. At the beginning and the end of the dietary intervention, anthropometric characteristics, biochemical parameters, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b), vitamins B and homocysteine concentrations were determined.

The expression of , a  gene copy, partially compensates for  disruption due to exon-7 excision in 90% of transcripts subsequently explaining the strong clinical heterogeneity. Several alterations in energy , like glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia, have been reported in SMA at both systemic and cellular level, prompting questions about the potential role of energy homeostasis and/or production involvement in disease progression. In this context, we have recently reported the tolerance of mild SMA-like mice ( ) to 10 months of low-intensity running or high-intensity swimming exercise programs, respectively involving aerobic and a mix aerobic/anaerobic muscular metabolic pathways. Here, we investigated whether those exercise-induced benefits were associated with an improvement in metabolic status in mild SMA-like mice. We showed that untrained SMA-like mice exhibited a dysregulation of  with an enhancement of lipogenesis and adipocyte deposits when compared to control mice. Moreover, they displayed a high oxygen consumption and energy expenditure through β-oxidation increase yet for the same levels of spontaneous activity. Interestingly, both exercises significantly improved  and glucose homeostasis in SMA-like mice, and enhanced oxygen consumption efficiency with the maintenance of a high oxygen consumption for higher levels of spontaneous activity. Surprisingly, more significant effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol with the maintenance of high  oxidation. Finally, when combining electron microscopy, respiratory chain complexes expression and enzymatic activity measurements in muscle mitochondria, we found that (1) a muscle-specific decreased in enzymatic activity of respiratory chain I, II, and IV complexes for equal amount of mitochondria and complexes expression and () a significant decline in mitochondrial maximal oxygen consumption, were reduced by both exercise programs. Most of the beneficial effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol. Taking together, our data support the hypothesis that active physical exercise, including high-intensity protocols, induces metabolic adaptations at both systemic and cellular levels, providing further evidence for its use in association with SMN-overexpressing therapies, in the long-term care of SMA patients.Copyright © 2019 Houdebine, D’Amico, Bastin, Chali, Desseille, Rumeau, Soukkari, Oudot, Rouquet, Bariohay, Roux, Sapaly, Weill, Lopes, Djouadi, Bezier, Charbonnier and Biondi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603061>Differential effects of ruminally protected amino acids on fattening of fallow deer in two culling periods.</a></h1><p>A well-balanced amino acid profile in the feedstuffs for livestock is essential to support adequate growth. This is well studied for monogastric species but still not well understood for ruminants and especially for the most unconventional species, like cervids. This study investigated the influence of ruminally protected lysine (Lys) and methionine (Met) supplementation during the fattening period, as well as two slaughter seasons (late autumn (LA) v. late winter (LW)), on the growth, carcass traits, body condition and blood plasma metabolites of fallow deer (Dama dama). Forty-five yearlings of fallow deer bucks were allocated into three groups, balanced by weight (40. ± .7 kg). The deer were pasture-fed and supplemented with barley, free-choice mineral premix, silage during the winter period, and varying levels of ruminally protected Lys and Met: no amino acids (Control), 9 g/day of Lys, and 9 g/day of Lys plus 3 g/day of Met (Lys+Met). Animals were slaughtered in two separate seasons, LA (six animals per group), and LW (nine animals per group). Animals culled in LA had higher average daily weight gain than LW (P = 0.002), due to the reduced growth during winter typical for seasonal cervids in temperate zone, mediated by the photoperiod. Dressing percentage was significantly higher in LW and in the Lys+Met group (P = 0.002). Body condition score (P = 0.024), kidney  index (KFI) (P = 0.005), and internal  (P < 0.001) increased significantly with Lys+Met supplementation. During LW, KFI (P = 0.004) and kidney  (P = 0.001) were also significantly higher than in LA. Blood creatinine concentration increased significantly for deer receiving Lys (P = 0.002) and Lys+Met (P < 0.001). Also, triglycerides level increased in Lys group (P < 0.001). These findings highlight the effects of Lys and Met supplementation on the growth and internal  storage for winter survival, suggesting a different use of the supplemented resource according to the season.

The aim of this study was to examine the associations of short- and long-term regional ambient and near-roadway air pollution (NRAP) exposures on adiposity and cardiometabolic health in young adults aged 17-22 years.From 2014 to 2018, a subset of participants (n = 158) were recruited from the Children's Health Study to participate in the Meta-AIR (Metabolic and Asthma Incidence Research) study to assess obesity (body composition and abdominal adiposity) and cardiometabolic health (fasting glucose, fasting insulin and  profiles) measures. Prior 1-month and 1-year average air pollution exposures were calculated from residential addresses. This included nitrogen dioxide (NO), ozone (O), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 μm (PM), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < .5 μm (PM) and NRAP (freeway, non-freeway, and total nitrogen oxides (NO)) exposures. Linear regression models examined associations of prior 1-month (short-term) and 1-year (long-term) air pollution exposures on obesity and cardiometabolic factors adjusting for covariates and past childhood air pollution exposures.In the Meta-AIR study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis with short- and long-term regional ambient and NRAP exposures (in both single- and multi-pollutant models) and obesity- and cardiometabolic-related outcomes and found associations with a few outcomes. A 1 standard deviation (SD) change in long-term NO exposure was associated with a 11.3 mg/dL higher level of total cholesterol (p = 0.04) and 9.4 mg/dL higher level of low-density lipoproteins (LDL)-cholesterol (p = 0.04). Amongst obese participants, associations between long-term NO and total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were 4.5 and 9 times larger than the associations in non-obese participants (p = 0.008 and 0.03, respectively). Additionally, we observed a statistically significant association with increased short-term O exposure and higher triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels (p = 0.04), lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (p = 0.03), and higher hepatic  levels (p = 0.02). Amongst glucose-related factors, long-term PM exposure was associated with higher levels of insulin area under the curve (p = 0.03). There were no other statistically significant associations with short- or long-term air pollutants and BMI, other measures of adiposity, and cardiometabolic outcomes.Higher exposure to regional air pollutants, namely prior 1-year average NO, was associated with higher fasting serum  measures. These associations were more pronounced in obese participants, suggesting obesity may exacerbate the effects of air pollution exposure on  levels in young adults. This study did not find any other associations between short- and long-term ambient and NRAP exposures across a range of other obesity and cardiometabolic indicators.

Here, we used hearing-specific cells and tissues OC-1 cells and zebrafish inner ear tissues as models to identify common transcriptome changes in genes and pathways in the absence of human OSBPL2 orthologues by RNA-seq analysis. In total, 2112 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between wild-type (WT) and Osbpl2 OC-1 cells, and 877 DEGs were identified between WT and osbpl2b zebrafish inner ear tissues. Functional annotation implicated Osbpl2/osbpl2b in , cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix in both OC-1 cells and zebrafish inner ear tissues.

Linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) are members of two classes of PUFAs, namely the n-6 and n-3 series, which are required for normal human health. Both are considered precursors of a cascade of molecules (eicosanoids), which take part in many biological processes (inflammation, vasoconstriction/vasodilation, thromboregulation, etc.). However, their biological functions are opposite and are mainly related to the form (precursor or long-chain products) in which they were administered and to the enzyme-substrate preference. ALA is widely present in common vegetable oils and foods, marine algae, and natural herbs, whereas its long-chain PUFA derivatives are available mainly in fish and animal product origins. Recent studies have shown that the accumulation of n-3 PUFAs seems mostly to be tissue-dependent and acts in a tissue-selective manner. Furthermore, dietary n-3 PUFAs widely affect the  oxidation susceptibility of all tissues. In conclusion, sustainable sources of n-3 PUFAs are limited and exert a different effect about (1) the form in which they are administered, precursor or derivatives; () their antioxidant protections; and (3) the purpose to be achieved (health improvement, physiological and reproductive traits, metabolic pathways, etc.).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630534>Comparison of murine steatohepatitis models identifies a dietary intervention with robust fibrosis, ductular reaction and rapid progression to cirrhosis, cancer.</a></h1><p>Progressive fibrosis, liver failure and cancer are central liver-related outcomes of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but notoriously difficult to achieve in mouse models. We performed a direct, quantitative comparison of hepatic fibrosis progression in well-defined methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) and choline-deficient, amino-acid defined (CDAA) diets with increasing  content (10-60% by calories) in C57Bl/6J and BALB/cAnNCrl mice.In C57Bl/6J mice, MCD feeding resulted in moderate fibrosis at week 8 (-fold increase in hepatic collagen content) and progressive weight loss, irrespective of  content. In contrast, CDAA-fed mice did not lose weight and developed progressive fibrosis starting from week 4. High dietary  in the CDAA diet model dose-dependently induced the  genes SREBP and SCD2, and increased the ductular reaction and fibrosis. Longitudinal analysis of CDAA with 60%  (HF-CDAA) feeding revealed pronounced ductular reaction and perisinusoidal bridging fibrosis, with a 7-fold increase of hepatic collagen at week 12, that showed limited spontaneous reversibility. At 24 weeks, HF-CDAA mice developed signs of cirrhosis with 10-fold HYP increase, regenerative nodules, portal hypertension and elevated serum bilirubin and ammonia; 80% of mice (8/10) developed multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). High  supplementation of MCD in C57Bl/6J, or feeding HF-CDAA diet to fibrosis-prone BALB/cAnNCrl strain failed to result in increased fibrosis.In conclusion, HF-CDAA feeding in C57Bl/6J mice was identified as an optimal model of steatohepatitis with robust fibrosis and ductular proliferations that progress to cirrhosis and HCC within 24 weeks.

Tg6 mice with chronic erythropoietin overexpression have a high hematocrit, reduced trabecular and cortical bone and bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein  driven ectopic bone and adipocyte formation. Erythropoietin treatment (1 200 IU·kg) for 10 days similarly exhibit increased hematocrit, reduced bone and bone marrow adipocytes without increased osteoclasts, and reduced bone morphogenic protein signaling in the bone marrow. Interestingly, endogenous erythropoietin is required for normal differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells to osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes. ΔEpoR mice with erythroid restricted erythropoietin receptor exhibit reduced trabecular bone, increased bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein  ectopic bone formation. Erythropoietin treated ΔEpoR mice achieved hematocrit similar to wild-type mice without reduced bone, suggesting that bone reduction with erythropoietin treatment is associated with non-erythropoietic erythropoietin response. Bone marrow stromal cells from wild-type, Tg6, and ΔEpoR-mice were transplanted into immunodeficient mice to assess development into a bone/marrow organ. Like endogenous bone formation, Tg6 bone marrow cells exhibited reduced differentiation to bone and adipocytes indicating that high erythropoietin inhibits osteogenesis and adipogenesis, while ΔEpoR bone marrow cells formed ectopic bones with reduced trabecular regions and increased adipocytes, indicating that loss of erythropoietin signaling favors adipogenesis at the expense of osteogenesis.

Most proteomic studies have focused on atherosclerotic plaques, vascular cells, monocytes and platelets in the blood; however, the concentration of these factors in plasma is low, making it difficult to measure the complexity of plasma components. Moreover, some studies have examined the plasma protein of patients with acute coronary syndrome with histochemistry; however, the results are not consistent. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the differential proteins in the plasma of patients with AMI via proteomics to identify new biomarkers of AMI.In this study, immunodepletion of high-abundance plasma proteins followed by an isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyze plasma samples from 5 control individuals and 10 AMI patients.Four hundred sixty-eight proteins were identified from two samples, and 33 proteins were differentially expressed in AMI patients compared to the controls. Among the 33 proteins, 12 proteins showed a ≥1.5-fold change between AMI and control samples. These proteins included fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3, ratio =6.36), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB ratio =4.89), adenylate kinase1 (AK1 ratio =4.16), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP ratio =3.29), creatine kinase (CK ratio =.88), platelet factor 4 (PF4 ratio =.62), peptidyl prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A (PPIA ratio =.05), Cofilin-1 (CFL1 ratio =1.81), coronin1A (CORO1A ratio =1.71), protein kinase M (PKM ratio =1.63), ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1, ratio =1.67), and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI1 ratio =1.56). By contrast, there was a decrease of 19 proteins, such as adiponectin (ADIPOQ ratio =0.70), insulin-like growth factor binding protein6 (IGFBP6 ratio =0.70), Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3 ratio =0.70) and complement 4B (C4B ratio =0.68). The most over-represented term was regulation of cell proliferation in the cellular component category of Gene Ontology (GO). The top 3 biological process terms were regulation of cell proliferation, response to wounding and wound healing. These proteins included immune proteins, blood coagulation proteins,  proteins, cytoskeleton proteins, energy  proteins, gene regulation proteins, myocutaneous proteins, and myocardial remodeling proteins and were highly connected with each other, which indicates that the functional network of these processes contribute to the pathophysiology of AMI.In conclusion, the present quantitative proteomic study identified novel AMI biomarker candidates and might provide fundamental information for the development of an AMI biomarker.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Smoking may be linked to insulin resistance that leads to impaired glucose and . Aim of the study was to assess the levels of fasting serum glucose level in healthy male cigarette smokers in order to compare this parameter with healthy non smokers. This comparative study was carried out in the Department of Physiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from July 2013 to June 2014. One hundred healthy male subjects (75 male were cigarette smokers as study group and 25 male were non smokers as control group) aged between 16 to 40 years were enrolled in this study. Fasting serum glucose was estimated by GOD-PAP Method. Data were expressed as mean±SD and statistical significance of difference among the group was calculated by unpaired students''t' test. The mean±SD fasting serum glucose (FSG) levels were higher in smoker group in comparison to the non smoker group. There were gradual increases in FSG levels in the smokers as the duration of smoking was increased and these were 4.75±0.88, 5.12±0.67, 5.29±0.47 and 5.58±.05mmol/L in group I, IIA, IIB and IIC respectively. This study concludes cigarette smoking impair the carbohydrate  and increase fasting serum glucose level in accordance with the duration of smoking.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676775>Characterizing the Role of HMG-CoA Reductase in Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor-Mediated Liver Injury in C57BL/6 Mice.</a></h1><p>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor. The prototypical ligand of the AHR is an environmental contaminant called ,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD exposure is associated with many adverse health outcomes in humans including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous studies suggest that AHR ligands alter cholesterol homeostasis in mice through repression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, such as Hmgcr, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis called 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). In this study, we sought to characterize the impact of HMGCR repression in TCDD-induced liver injury. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to TCDD in the presence or absence of simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMGCR. Simvastatin exposure decreased TCDD-induced hepatic  accumulation in both sexes, but was most prominent in females. Simvastatin and TCDD (S + T) co-treatment increased hepatic AHR-battery gene expression and liver injury in male, but not female, mice. In addition, the S + T co-treatment led to an increase in hepatic glycogen content that coincides with heavier liver in female mice. Results from this study suggest that statins, which are amongst the most prescribed pharmaceuticals, may protect from AHR-mediated steatosis, but alter glycogen  and increase the risk of TCDD-elicited liver damage in a sex-specific manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602989>Melatonin treatment prevents carbon tetrachloride-induced acute lung injury in rats by mitigating tissue antioxidant capacity and inflammatory response.</a></h1><p>Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is an organic chemical that produces different tissue‑damaging effects when ingested or inhaled. Present study aims to determine whether the application of exogenous melatonin, a neurohormone with numerous biological properties, can prevent disturbances in lung tissue antioxidative capacities and arginine , tissue inflammation and oxidative damage induced by exposure to CCl4 in rats.The effects of melatonin on the changes occurring in rat lung tissue after an acute exposure to CCl4 were studied by monitoring alterations in antioxidant capacities, inflammatory parameters, parameters of arginine , and  and protein oxidative damage.The results indicated that melatonin prevents CCl4-induced lung damage by mitigating tissue antioxidant capacity and preventing nitric oxide production through a shift from nitric oxide synthase to arginase. Also, melatonin partially prevented tissue inflammation and molecules' oxidative modification seen after exposure to CCl4.The protective activity of melatonin can be attributed to its ability to scavenge both free radicals, as well as to its potential to increase tissue antioxidant capacity. The modulation of inflammatory response through both decrease in tissue inflammatory parameters and influence on arginine-nitric oxide  might be an additional mechanism of action (Tab. 1, Fig. , Ref. 33).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675452>Bone Marrow and Muscle  Infiltration are Correlated Among Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis: the AMBERS Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>Bone and muscle have shown to interact, but little is known about  within bone and muscle. Clinical studies have isolated  within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg.  segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<5%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow ) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±5.9yrs, BMI: 29.5±5.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle  was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily energy expenditure, hypertension and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis.  from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone  and mesenchymal cell commitment to  within patients with osteoporosis. This article is protected by copyright.

To determine maternal and fetal contributions to  flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid  were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid  alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves  deficits in fetal carbohydrate  by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid  in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient  in mediating maternal-fetal  communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

We analyzed the clinical data from 1421 T2DM inpatients at Wuhan Union Hospital. Subjects were divided into early-onset T2DM group (diagnostic age <40 years) and late-onset T2DM group (diagnostic age >40 years). All subjects underwent a standardized assessment of microvascular complications. Data were compared with independent-samples t test or Chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors of microvascular complications. Patients with early-onset T2DM were more inclined to have a lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), a longer duration of diabetes and higher levels of body mass index (BMI), uric acid (UA), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC)- triglyceride (TG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) than those with late-onset T2DM (P<0.05). The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) was significantly higher and that of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was significantly lower in early-onset group than in late-onset group (P<0.05). For DN, UA was an independent risk factor in early-onset T2DM. SBP and TG were independent risk factors in late-onset T2DM. For DR, duration of diabetes and SBP were independent risk factors in early-onset T2DM. Duration of diabetes, SBP and HbA1c were independent risk factors in late-onset T2DM. This study demonstrated that the clinical characteristics of early-onset T2DM were metabolic disorders, including glucose ,  and amino acid . Early-onset T2DM was more likely to be associated with DR. The potential pathogenesis of early and late-onset T2DM might be different. The management of metabolic risk factors especially HbA1c, SBP, TG and UA is advised to be performed in the early stage of diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599132>Emerging Mechanisms of GH-Induced Lipolysis and Insulin Resistance.</a></h1><p>Growth hormone (GH) is a pleiotropic hormone that coordinates an array of physiological processes including growth and . GH promotes anabolic action in all tissues except adipose, where it catabolizes stored  to release energy for the promotion of growth in other tissues. However, chronic stimulation of lipolysis by GH results in an increased flux of free fatty acids (FFAs) into systemic circulation. Hence, a sustained release of high levels of GH contributes significantly to the development of insulin resistance by antagonizing the anti-lipolytic action of insulin. The molecular pathways associated with the lipolytic effect of GH in adipose tissue however, remain elusive. Recent studies have provided molecular insights into GH-induced lipolysis and impairment of insulin signaling. This review discusses the physiological and metabolic actions of GH on adipose tissue as well as GH-mediated deregulation of the FSP27-PPARγ axis which alters adipose tissue homeostasis and contributes to the development of insulin resistance and Type  diabetes.Copyright© of YS Medical Media ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615167>Are Circulating Mg Levels Associated with Glucose Tolerance Profiles and Incident Type  Diabetes?</a></h1><p>Magnesium (Mg) is an enzyme co-factor that plays a key role in many biochemical reactions, as well as in glucose . Clinical evidences have demonstrated that depletion of serum Mg increases exponentially with the duration of type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Diabetes is associated with low Mg, and hypomagnesemia is associated with insulin resistance, inflammation, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. In subjects at high risk of inflammation and insulin resistance, supplementation of Mg alone ameliorates both phenotypes, slowing the development and progression of hepatic steatosis. We analyze the relationship between serum Mg levels and the onset of T2DM in a large cohort of well-characterized adult white individuals participating in the CATAMERI study, who were reexamined after a mean follow-up of 5.6 ± 0.9 years. In our analysis we acquired a significant negative correlation between Mg levels, fasting glucose, and 2h-post load glucose in subjects who underwent an OGTT. Moreover, Mg levels correlated negatively with fasting insulin levels, and positively with the  profile. As for the detrimental effect of lower circulating Mg levels, our data revealed a significant reduction of T2DM risk of about 20% for each 1 mg/dL increase of circulating Mg. The present results are consistent with the theory that Mg supplementation could ameliorate insulin sensitivity reducing the risk to develop T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658729>Sugar-Lowering Drugs for Type  Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Syndrome-Review of Classical and New Compounds: Part-I.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia together with disturbances in the  of carbohydrates, proteins and , which in general results from an insulin availability and need imbalance.

After year 1, patients could enter the all-evolocumab period and receive evolocumab + SOC for an additional 4 years. The authors analyzed the persistence of  effects and exposure-dependent safety focusing on yearly rates of adverse events (AEs) and anti-drug antibodies over 4.951 patient-years of observation.A total of 1,255 patients (safety analysis population) randomized into the year 1 SOC-controlled period and received ≥1 evolocumab dose (mean ± SD age 57 ± 12 years; 53% female). A total of 1,151 patients (efficacy analysis population) progressed to the all-evolocumab period (year  and beyond). Evolocumab + SOC persistently lowered mean ± SE low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 56% ± 0.6% (n = 1,071), 57% ± 0.8% (n = 1,001), 56% ± 0.8% (n = 943), and 56% ± 0.8% (n = 803) after approximately , 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, from randomization. Mean baseline LDL-C decreased from 140 to 61 mg/dl on treatment. Yearly serious AE rates during evolocumab + SOC ranged from 6.9% to 7.9%, comparable to the 6.8% rate in SOC patients during year 1. Evolocumab discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 5.7% of patients. Two SOC and  evolocumab + SOC patients developed new, transient, binding anti-drug antibodies; no neutralizing antibodies were observed.The OSLER-1 trial demonstrated consistently excellent LDL-C-lowering efficacy, tolerance, and safety of evolocumab, with no neutralizing antibodies detected, throughout the longest-duration study of a PCSK9 inhibitor reported to date.

However, researches on the impact of isoflurane on insulin-related  in the central nervous system, especially in type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are scarce. This study sought to explore whether isoflurane anesthesia had a negative effect on insulin sensitivity both in peripheral and central tissues. Moreover, the possible role of isoflurane anesthesia in T2DM mice with pre-existing IR was analyzed. T2DM model in C57BL/6J mice was established by high  diet (HFD) and single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Both HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice and normal mice received 6 h isoflurane exposure. Blood glucose level and serum insulin concentration were detected and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated to estimate peripheral IR. Relative levels of genes and proteins in the insulin-dependent signaling pathway in mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined to measure central IR. Results indicated that 6 h isoflurane exposure induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and raised HOMA-IR index. Meanwhile, phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) (Ser639) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate- (pIRS2) (Ser731) were upregulated, while phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) (Ser473) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (pGSK3β) (Ser9) were downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of anesthetized mice. Notably, isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravated the degree of central IR in the aspects of gene transcriptions and protein expressions in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice with pre-existing IR. This study suggested that isoflurane anesthesia induced peripheral and central IR and aggravated pre-existing insulin resistance in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019.

However, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that an increase in dietary saturated fat could lead to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and heart rhythm by a NOX2 (NADPH oxidase )-dependent mechanism.We investigated this hypothesis by feeding mice high-fat diets. In vivo heart rhythm telemetry, optical mapping, and isolated cardiac myocyte imaging were used to quantify arrhythmias, repolarization, calcium transients, and intracellular calcium sparks.We found that saturated fat activates NOX (NADPH oxidase), whereas polyunsaturated fat does not. The high saturated fat diet increased repolarization heterogeneity and ventricular tachycardia inducibility in perfused hearts. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of NOX2 prevented arrhythmogenic abnormalities in vivo during high statured fat diet and resulted in less inducible ventricular tachycardia. High saturated fat diet activates CaMK (Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) in the heart, which contributes to abnormal calcium handling, promoting arrhythmia.We conclude that NOX2 deletion or pharmacological inhibition prevents the arrhythmogenic effects of a high saturated fat diet, in part mediated by activation of CaMK. This work reveals a molecular mechanism linking cardiac  to arrhythmia and suggests that NOX2 inhibitors could be a novel therapy for heart rhythm abnormalities caused by cardiac lipid overload.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614330>Impact of Polarized Versus Threshold Training on  and Neuromuscular Variables in Ultrarunners.</a></h1><p>To compare the effects of  different intensity distribution training programs (threshold [THR] and polarized [POL]) on  and neuromuscular variables.Twenty ultrarunners were allocated to POL (n = 11; age 40.6 [9.7] y, weight 73.5 [10.8] kg, VO2max 55.8 [4.9] mL·kg-1·min-1) or THR group (n = 9; age 36.8 [9.] y, weight 75.5 [10.4] kg, VO2max 57.1 [5.] mL·kg-1·min-1) and performed a 12-week training program that consisted of 5 running sessions,  strength sessions, and 1 day of full rest per week. Both groups performed similar total training duration and load but with different intensity distribution during running sessions. Resting metabolic rate, , isometric rate of force development (RFD; N·s-1) and maximal voluntary contraction in the knee extensor, and electromyographic amplitude were measured before and after each program.A significant decrease in RFD0-100 ms (Δ -13.4%; P ≤ .001; effect size [ES] = 1.00), RFD0-200 ms (Δ -11.7%; P ≤ .001; ES = 1.4), and RFDpeak (Δ -18%; P ≤ .001; ES = 1.4) were observed in the POL group. In THR group, a significant increase in mean electromyographic amplitude (Δ 24.4%; P = .02; ES = 1.4) was observed. There were no significant differences between groups in any of the variables.Similar adaptations in  and neuromuscular performance can be achieved after 12 weeks of POL or THR intensity distribution. However, THR distribution appears to better maintain strength (RFD) and improve mean electromyographic amplitude. Nevertheless, the combination of both running and maximum strength training could influence on results because of the residual fatigue thus inducing suboptimal adaptations in the POL group.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597730>Effects of FABP knockdown on flight performance of the desert locust, .</a></h1><p>During migratory flight, desert locusts rely on fatty acids as their predominant source of energy. Lipids mobilized in the  body are transported to the flight muscles and enter the muscle cells as free fatty acids. It has been postulated that muscle fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) is needed for the efficient translocation of fatty acids through the aqueous cytosol towards mitochondrial β-oxidation. To assess whether FABP is required for this process, dsRNA was injected into freshly emerged adult males to knockdown the expression of FABP. Three weeks after injection, FABP and its mRNA were undetectable in flight muscle, indicating efficient silencing of FABP expression. At rest, control and treated animals exhibited no morphological or behavioral differences. In tethered flight experiments, both control and treated insects were able to fly continually in the initial, carbohydrate-fueled phase of flight, and in both groups lipids were mobilized and released into the hemolymph. Flight periods exceeding thirty minutes, however, when fatty acids become the main energy source, were rarely possible for FABP-depleted animals, while control insects continued to fly for more than  h.

Moreover, environmental factors that directly affect the secretion of lipokines such as diet, exercise, and exposure to cold temperatures constitute attractive therapeutic strategies, but the mechanisms that regulate lipokine stimulation have not been thoroughly reviewed. In this study, we will discuss the chemical characteristics of lipokines that position them as attractive targets for chronic disease treatment and prevention and the emerging roles of lipokines as regulators of inter-tissue communication. We will define the target tissues of lipokines, and explore the ability of lipokines to prevent or delay the onset and development of chronic diseases.

However, the role of PKA in NAFLD has not been well tested in vivo due to the lack of optimal PKA deficient mouse model.A novel PKA-specific inhibitor gene was conditionally overexpressed in mouse (PKAi mouse) liver using LoxP/Cre system. PKA activity in the liver extract was measured with a commercial assay kit. The PKAi and control mice of 8-week age, were subjected to HFD or chow diet (CD) for  months. Body weight, liver index, and triglyceride in the liver were measured. RNA sequencing was performed for the liver tissues and analyzed with Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment.PKAi-GFP protein was overexpressed in the liver and the PKA activation was significantly inhibited in the liver of PKAi mouse.

However, when fed with HFD for  months, the liver was enlarged more, and the accumulation of triglyceride in the liver was more severe in PKAi mice. When comparing the transcriptomes of CD-fed and HFD-fed control mice, GO enrichment showed that the genes down-regulated by HFD were mainly enriched in immune-related GO terms, and up-regulated genes were enriched in . When comparing the transcriptomes of CD-fed and HFD-fed PKAi mice, GO analysis showed that the down-regulated genes were enriched in , while the up-regulated genes were clustered in ER stress-related pathways. When comparing HFD-fed PKAi and HFD-fed control mice, the genes with lower expression level in PKAi mice were enriched in the lipoprotein synthesis, which might explain that more TG is accumulated in PKAi liver after HFD feeding.Reduced PKA activity could be a factor promoting the TG accumulation in the liver and the development of NAFLD.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610152>Racial differences in body composition and cardiometabolic risk during the menopause transition: a prospective, observational cohort study.</a></h1><p>Obesity disproportionately affects more women than men. The loss of ovarian function during the menopause transition coincides with weight gain, increases in abdominal adiposity, and impaired metabolic health. Racial differences in obesity prevalence that results from the menopause transition are not well understood.To assess longitudinal changes in body composition and cardiometabolic risk among Black and White women during the menopausal transition.In a secondary analysis of a prospective, observational cohort study-the Healthy Transitions study-161 women aged 43 years and older with body mass index between 20 and 40 kg/m and who had not yet transitioned through menopause were enrolled at Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Women were seen annually for body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; abdominal adipose tissue distribution by computed tomography; sex steroid hormones; and cardiometabolic risk factors including fasting glucose, insulin, and lipids. Surrogate measures of insulin sensitivity were also calculated.Ninety-four women (25 Black, 69 White) transitioned through menopause and were included within the analyses. At menopause onset, Black women weighed more (77.8±3.0 vs. 70.8±1.8 kg), and had higher systolic (125±16 vs. 118±14 mmHg) and diastolic (80±8 vs. 74±7 mmHg) blood pressure compared to White women (all p≤0.05). No other differences in body composition, sex steroid hormones, or cardiometabolic risk factors were observed at menopause onset. Before menopause, White women gained significant weight (+3 kg), total body adiposity (+6% percent body , +9%  mass, +12% trunk  mass), and abdominal adipose tissue (+19% subcutaneous , +15% visceral , +19% total adipose tissue) which coincided with significant decreases in estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, and estrone sulfate, as well as increases in follicle-stimulating hormone, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Conversely, Black women had more abdominal adipose tissue before menopause, which was maintained across the menopause transition. Black women also had significant decreases in estrone sulfate and total testosterone, as well as increases in follicle-stimulating hormone before menopause. In the postmenopausal years, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue, total adipose tissue, follicle-stimulating hormone, total cholesterol, and low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased only in White women.White women gained more abdominal adiposity during the menopause transition compared to Black women, which may be due in part to differences in the pattern of sex steroid hormone changes between women of different racial backgrounds. The gains in abdominal adiposity in White women were observed in tandem with increased cardiometabolic risk factors. Future studies should consider comprehensive lifestyle approaches to target these increased gains in abdominal adiposity (i.e., nutrition and physical activity coaching), while also taking into account the potential interactions of race, body adiposity, sex steroid hormones, and their influence on cardiometabolic risk.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to assess the relation of  peroxidation and interleukin-6 with carotid atherosclerosis in type  diabetes mellitus.This cross-sectional study included 90 type  diabetes mellitus male patients with age ≥ 40 years and 30 healthy male subjects matched for age. All of them were subjected to measuring of 8-iso prostaglandin F2α as a marker of  peroxidation, interleukin-6 and carotid intima media thickness as a marker of carotid atherosclerosis.Both 8-iso prostaglandin F2α and interleukin-6 were found to have significant positive correlation with carotid intima media thickness ( < 0.001) and both were found to be significant predictors of the presence of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in multiple regression analysis. peroxidation and interleukin-6 may play an important role in atherogenesis in type  diabetes mellitus and limiting their effects may reduce atherosclerotic vascular complications in type  diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Therefore, we conducted a preliminary study on the anti-obesity effect of PGE in 108 Korean adults (aged 20-60 years, 30 kg/m ≥ body mass index ≥ 23 kg/m). The participants were randomly assigned to four groups and were administered the placebo, PGE571 (571 mg as PGE), PGE1142 (1142 mg as PGE), and PGE2855 (2855 mg as PGE), independently, for 12 weeks. Body composition, nutrient intake, computed tomography scan, and plasma adipokines, as well as hepatic/renal function markers, were assessed. The PGE571 group revealed a significant decrease in body  mass and body  percentage when compared with the placebo group. Moreover, the total abdominal and subcutaneous  areas were significantly decreased following PGE (PGE2855 group) supplementation.

NAFLD, associated lipotoxicity, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and altered mitochondrial , is responsible for systemic inflammation, which contributes to organ dysfunction in extrahepatic tissues, including the heart. We investigated the ability of L-carnitine (LC) to oppose the pathogenic mechanisms underlying NAFLD progression and associated heart dysfunction, in a mouse model of methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCDD). Mice were divided into three groups: namely, the control group (CONTR) fed with a regular diet and two groups fed with MCDD for 6 weeks. In the last 3 weeks, one of the MCDD groups received LC (200 mg/kg each day) through drinking water (MCDD + LC). The hepatic  accumulation and oxidative stress decreased after LC supplementation, which also reduced hepatic fibrosis via modulation of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), peroxisome-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and nuclear factor kappa B (NfƙB) expression. LC ameliorated systemic inflammation, mitigated cardiac reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and prevented fibrosis progression by acting on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1- (ERK1-), and αSMA. This study confirms the existence of a relationship between fatty liver disease and cardiac abnormalities and highlights the role of LC in controlling liver oxidative stress, steatosis, fibrosis, and NAFLD-associated cardiac dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that brain insulin signaling plays an important role in the pathophysiology of type  diabetes. This study explores whether the antidiabetic effect of DJB is involved in brain insulin signaling activation and brain glucose utilization.A diabetic rat model was established by high- and high-glucose diet. DJB or sham surgery was performed in diabetic rats. 18F-FDG PET scanning was used to detect glucose uptake in different organs, particularly in the brain. The levels of glucose transporters, glucose utilization-related proteins (HK1 and PFK2), insulin, and insulin signaling pathway-related proteins (InsR, IRS1/, PI3K, and p-Akt) in the brain tissues were evaluated and analyzed.The results showed that DJB significantly improved basal glycemic parameters and reversed the decreasing glucose uptake in the brains of type  diabetic rats. DJB significantly increased not only the expression levels of brain insulin, IRS1/, PI3K, and p-Akt but also the levels of the glucose utilization enzymes HK1 and PFK2 in the brain.These results indicate that enhanced brain insulin signaling transduction and brain glucose utilization play important roles in the antidiabetic effect of DJB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664995>CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of SPRY2 in human hepatocytes leads to increased glucose uptake and lipid droplet accumulation.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities, including type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is dramatically increasing throughout the world; however, the underlying aetiology is incompletely understood. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genec susceptibility loci for obesity and T2DM, although the causal genes and mechanisms are largely unknown. SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body fat percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to insulin production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and insulin resistance.CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and lipid droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated lipid droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling  (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling . Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) mRNA level was subsequently validated as significantly upregulated following SPRY2 KO, highlighting this as a potential mediator downstream of SPRY2.These findings suggest a role for SPRY2 in glucose and lipid  in hepatocytes and contribute to clarifying the function of this gene in the context of  diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632279>Synergistic Combination of Polymyxin B and Enrofloxacin Induced Metabolic Perturbations in Extensive Drug-Resistant .</a></h1><p>Polymyxins are used as a last-resort class of antibiotics against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative . As polymyxin monotherapy is associated with potential development of resistance, combination therapy is highly recommended. This study investigated the mechanism underlying the synergistic killing of polymyxin B and enrofloxacin against extensive drug-resistant (XDR) . An XDR isolate  12196 was treated with clinically relevant concentrations of polymyxin B ( mg/L) and enrofloxacin (1 mg/L) alone or in combination. Metabolome profiles were investigated from bacterial samples collected at 1-and 4-h posttreatment using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics. Significantly perturbed metabolites ( < 0.05, fold change ≥ ) were subjected to pathway analysis. The synergistic killing by polymyxin B-enrofloxacin combination was initially driven by polymyxin B as indicated by the perturbation of  metabolites at 1 h in particular. The killing was subsequently driven by enrofloxacin  the inhibition of DNA replication, resulting in the accumulation of nucleotides at 4 h. Furthermore, the combination uniquely altered levels of metabolites in energy  and cell envelope biogenesis. Most importantly, the combination significantly minimized polymyxin resistance  the inhibition of  A modification pathway, which was most evident at 4 h. This is the first study to elucidate the synergistic mechanism of polymyxin B-enrofloxacin combination against XDR . The metabolomics approach taken in this study highlights its power to elucidate the mechanism of synergistic killing by antibiotic combinations at the systems level.Copyright © 2019 Lin, Han, Zhao, Zhu, Rao, Forrest, Song, Kaye, Hertzog, Purcell, Creek, Zhou, Velkov and Li.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669255>Time-resolved Phosphoproteomic Analysis Elucidates Hepatic 11,12-Epoxyeicosatrienoic Acid Signaling .</a></h1><p>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are potent lipid mediators with well-established effects in vascular tissues. Recent studies indicated an emerging role of these eicosanoids in  diseases and the EET signaling pathway was shown to be involved in hepatic insulin sensitivity. However, compared to vascular tissues, there is only limited knowledge about the underlying signaling  in the liver. Therefore, we employed an LC-MS/MS-based time-resolved phosphoproteomics approach to characterize 11,12-EET-mediated signaling events in the liver cell line Hepa 1-6. 11,12-EET treatment resulted in the time-dependent regulation of phosphopeptides involved in processes as yet unknown to be affected by EETs, including RNA processing, splicing and translation regulation. Pathway analysis combined with western blot-based validation revealed enhanced AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signaling as demonstrated by increased acute phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and p70S6K (Thr389). In addition, 11,12-EET treatment led to differential regulation of phosphopeptides including important mediators of the DNA damage response and we observed a prolonged induction of the etoposide-induced DNA damage marker γH2AX in response to 11,12-EET. In summary, our findings extend current knowledge of 11,12-EET signaling events and emphasize the importance of the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway in hepatic 11,12-EET signaling. Based on the results presented in this study, we furthermore propose a novel role of EET signaling in the regulation of the DNA damage response.Copyright © 2019.

A total of 360 44-week-old Hy-Line brown laying hens were randomly distributed into four groups each with six replicates of 15 birds, and fed with corn-soybean-meal-based diets supplemented with 0, 0.15, 0.30, and 0.45 g/kg GML, respectively. Our results showed that 0.15, 0.30, and 0.45 g/kg GML treatments significantly decreased feed conversion ratios (FCRs) by .65%, 7.08%, and 3.54%, respectively, and significantly increased the laying rates and average egg weights. For egg quality, GML drastically increased albumen height and Haugh units, and enhanced yolk color. Notably, GML increased the concentrations of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and reduced the concentration of total saturated fatty acids in the yolk. The albumen composition was also significantly modified, with an increase of 1.02% in total protein content, and increased contents of His (4.55%) and Glu (.02%) under the 0.30 g/kg GML treatment. Additionally, GML treatments had positive effects on the  of laying hens, including lowering the serum triglyceride and total cholesterol levels and reducing  deposition in abdominal adipose tissue. Intestinal morphology was also improved by GML treatment, with increased villus length and villus height to crypt depth ratio. Our data demonstrated that GML supplementation of laying hens could have beneficial effects on both their productivity and physiological properties, which indicates the potential application of GML as a functional feed additive and gives us a new insight into this traditional food additive.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610782>Down-regulated of SREBP-1 in circulating leukocyte is a risk factor for atherosclerosis: a case control study.</a></h1><p>Sterol regulatory-element binding proteins (SREBPs) and mir-33 (miR-33a, miR-33b), which are encoded by the introns of SREBPs, are key factors in the  pathway. SREBPs mRNA in circulating leucocyte and carotid plaques, along with various risk factors that associated with Coronary Atherosclerotic Disease (CAD) were investigated in a central Chinese cohort.A total of 218 coronary atherosclerotic disease (CAD) patients, and 178 non-CAD controls, were recruited to collect leukocytes. Carotid plaques and peripheral blood were obtained from CAD patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) (n = 12) while THP-1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) to establish an in vitro foam cell formation model. SREBPs and miR-33 levels were quantified by qPCR. Routine biochemical markers were measured using standard procedures.SREBP-1 mRNA level of circulating leucocytes in CAD patients were significantly lower than in non-CAD controls (p = 0.005). After stratification coronary artery atherosclerotic complexity, we detected a significant reduction of SREBP-1 in high-risk complexity CAD patients (SYNTAX score > 23) (p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that decreased expression of SREBP-1 was a risk factor of CAD (odds ratio (OR) =0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.30~0.76, p = 0.002) after adjusting clinical confounders; the mRNA levels of SREBPs in carotid plaques correlated with the corresponding value in circulating leukocytes (SREBP-1 r = 0.717, p = 0.010; SREBP- r = 0.612, p = 0.034).

Enhancing DIT can lead to weight loss. Factors that increase DIT are expected to lower body mass index and body fat mass. Although various methods have been developed for measuring DIT in humans, there is currently no method available for calculating absolute DIT values in mice. Therefore, we attempted to measure DIT in mice by applying the method more commonly used for humans. Mouse energy  was first measured under fasting conditions; EE was plotted against the square root of the activity count, and a linear regression equation was fit to the data. Then, energy  was measured in mice that were allowed to feed ad libitum, and EE was plotted in the same way. We calculated the DIT by subtracting the predicted EE value from the fed EE value for the same activity count. The methodology for measuring DIT in mice may be helpful for researching ways of combatting obesity by increasing DIT. •The methodology for measuring absolute DIT values in mice is developed.•For mice, the proportion of DIT compared with calorie intake and EE are 12.3% and 21.7%, respectively.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665679>Probing the hepatotoxicity mechanisms of novel chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl sulfonates to zebrafish larvae: Implication of structural specificity.</a></h1><p>Hepatotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae elicited by legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and its three novel chlorinated alternatives, including chlorinated polyfluorooctane sulfonate (Cl-PFOS) and chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates (6: and 8: Cl-PFESA analogs), was evaluated in this study. Upon 7-day separate exposure to the four target compounds at 1 µmol/L, significant hepatic steatosis in exposed larvae was evidenced by pathological micro/macro vacuolation, which was presumably attributed to the excess accumulation of lipid, especially the overloaded triglyceride (TG) level. Disruption on gene transcription was subjected to a structure-dependent manner. In general, PFOS, Cl-PFOS and 6: Cl-PFESA of the identical carbon chain length (i.e. C8), despite with different substituents, displayed a similar activation mode and comparable disruptive potency on lipid  responsive genes, which particularly promoted fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acacb) and β-oxidation (cytochrome P450 enzymes-1A, cyp1a; peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1, acox1; and acyl-CoA dehy-drogenase, acadm). However, 8: Cl-PFESA with a prolonged carbon chain length (i.e. C10), preferentially disturbed fatty acid exportation (apolipoprotein-B100, apob) and triggered a different modulation pattern on fatty acid β-oxidation against the other three compounds. Molecular docking analysis indicated that 8: Cl-PFESA exhibited considerably higher peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) antagonism than others, corresponding to its unique suppression effect on fatty acid β-oxidation responsive genes. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study reporting hepatotoxicity of Cl-PFOS and Cl-PFESAs to aquatic organisms. Although characterized with different toxic mode-of-action, these novel alternatives can elicit hepatic steatosis as strong as PFOS, stressing the biological risks in view of their global contamination.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In contrast,  is one of the most strongly TZD-induced transcripts in human adipocytes, although not in cells from all individuals. Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +.5 kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human  as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS. These  low-expression variants may account for human genetic associations in this region with obesity as well as neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676981>Circulating palmitoleic acid is an independent determinant of insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals: a longitudinal analysis.</a></h1><p>Experimental studies suggest that the fatty acid palmitoleate may act as an adipocyte-derived  hormone (or 'lipokine') to regulate systemic . We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose insulin sensitivity index [OGIS]). The liver insulin resistance index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including  mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to  mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001), liver insulin resistance (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance ( h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in insulin sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and insulin sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals. These results support the role of palmitoleate as a beneficial lipokine released by adipose tissue to prevent the negative effects of adiposity and excess NEFA on systemic glucose .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669309>A novel ML domain-containing protein (SpMD2) functions as a potential LPS receptor involved in anti-Vibrio immune response.</a></h1><p>The myeloid differentiation protein  (MD2)-related lipid-recognition (ML) proteins display diverse biological functions in host immunity and lipid  by interacting with different lipids. Human MD2, an indispensable accessory protein in TLR4 signaling pathway, specifically recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS), thereby leading to the activation of TLR4 signaling pathway to produce many effectors that participate in inflammatory and immune responses against Gram-negative bacteria. Toll and immune deficiency (IMD)  are first characterized in Drosophila and are reportedly present in crustaceans, but the recognition and activation mechanism of these signaling  in crustaceans remains unclear. In the present study, a novel ML protein was characterized in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) and designated as SpMD2. The complete SpMD2 cDNA sequence is 1114 bp long with a 465 bp open reading frame; it encodes a protein that contains 154 amino acids (aa). In the deduced protein, a signal peptide (1-21 aa residues) and a ML domain (43-151 aa residues) were predicted. SpMD2 shared a similar three-dimensional structure and a close evolutionary relationship with human MD2. SpMD2 was highly expressed in gills, hemocytes, intestine, and hepatopancreas and was upregulated in gills and hemocytes after challenges with bacteria, thereby suggesting its involvement in antibacterial defense. Western blot assay showed that SpMD2 possesses strong binding activities to different bacteria and two fungi. ELISA demonstrated that SpMD2 exhibits binding abilities to LPS, lipid A, peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Its binding ability to LPS and lipid A were stronger than to PGN or LTA, implying that SpMD2 was an important LPS-binding protein in mud crab. Bacterial clearance assay revealed that the pre-incubation of Vibrio parahemolyticus with SpMD2 facilitates bacterial clearance in vivo and that knockdown of SpMD2 dramatically suppresses the bacterial clearance and decreases the expression of several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Furthermore, SpMD2 overexpression could enhance the promoter activity of SpALF2. These results revealed that SpMD2 affects bacterial clearance by regulating AMPs. Thus, by binding to LPS and by regulating AMPs, SpMD2 may function as a potential receptor, which is involved in the recognition and activation of a certain immune signaling pathway against Gram-negative bacteria. This study provides new insights into the diverse functions of ML proteins and into the antibacterial mechanisms of crustaceans.Copyright © 2019.

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy  and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal  in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate  (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal  in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614337>Metabolic impact of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma: Targeted metabolomics in patients before and after tumor removal.</a></h1><p>Excess catecholamine release by pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) leads to characteristic clinical features and increased morbidity and mortality.

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) are the ideal source to study  formation as they are the progenitors of adipocytes. In this work, we used human MSCs, received from surgery waste, and differentiated them into  adipocytes. The combination of several layers of information coming from lipidomics, metabolomics and proteomics enabled network analysis of the biochemical pathways in adipogenesis. Simultaneous analysis of metabolites, lipids, and proteins in cell culture is challenging due to the compound's chemical difference, so most studies involve separate analysis with unimolecular strategies. In this study, we employed a multimolecular approach using a two-phase extraction to monitor the crosstalk between  and protein-based signaling in a single sample (~10 cells). We developed an innovative analytical workflow including standardization with in-house produced C isotopically labeled compounds, hyphenated high-end mass spectrometry (high-resolution Orbitrap MS), and chromatography (HILIC, RP) for simultaneous untargeted screening and targeted quantification. Metabolite and  concentrations ranged over three to four orders of magnitude and were detected down to the low fmol (absolute on column) level. Biological validation and data interpretation of the multiomics workflow was performed based on proteomics network reconstruction, metabolic modelling (MetaboAnalyst 4.0), and pathway analysis (OmicsNet). Comparing MSCs and adipocytes, we observed significant regulation of different metabolites and lipids such as triglycerides, gangliosides, and carnitine with 113 fully reprogrammed pathways. The observed changes are in accordance with literature findings dealing with adipogenic differentiation of MSC. These results are a proof of principle for the power of multimolecular extraction combined with orthogonal LC-MS assays and network construction. Considering the analytical and biological validation performed in this study, we conclude that the proposed multiomics workflow is ideally suited for comprehensive follow-up studies on adipogenesis and is fit for purpose for different applications with a high potential to understand the complex pathophysiology of diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659627>Impact of Carbohydrate on Glucose Variability in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Assessed Through Professional Continuous Glucose Monitoring: A Retrospective Study.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to objectively analyze the correlation between dietary components and blood glucose variation by means of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who received CGM to manage their blood glucose levels were enrolled into the study, and the components of their total caloric intake were analyzed.

One additional percentage of protein calories of total calories per day decreased the MAGE to 4.25 mg/dL and CV to 0.012 (p < 0.05). The optimal dietary protein percentage for MAGE < 140 mg/dL was 15.13%. The performance of predictive models revealed the beneficial effect of adequate carbohydrate intake on glucose variation when combined with protein consumption.Adequate carbohydrate consumption-but not more than half the daily total calories-combined with protein calories that amount to approximately 15% of the daily caloric intake is important for glucose stability and beneficial for patients with T1DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627110>Triclosan-induced liver and brain injury in zebrafish (Danio rerio) via abnormal expression of miR-125 regulated by PKCα/Nrf2/p53 signaling pathways.</a></h1><p>Triclosan (TCS) is widely used in personal care products, and its chronic exposure leads to severely toxic effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio). PKCα, Nrf2 and p53 are three important signaling pathways concerned with cell development. Herein, we speculated on and verified a novel TCS regulatory pathway: (1) TCS acted on GPER (G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor) to activate MAPK/ERK pathway, further resulting in the expression changes of protein kinase C (PKC) family; () PKC participated in Nrf2 phosphorylation; (3) The expression of miR-125b was regulated by Nrf2; and (4) The expression changes of related genes in the PKCs-Nrf2-ARE pathway showed the specificity of zebrafish tissue and organ. TCS exposure led to down-regulation of the Nrf2 and phosphorylated Nrf2(Ser40) protein in diencephalon nucleus, stratum marginale and stratum centrale areas in adult zebrafish brain. The phosphorylated Nrf2(Ser40) was mainly expressed in PGz area, while it was not the case for Nrf2. Both Nrf2 and phosphorylated Nrf2 were activated by TCS exposure; however, the changing trend of PKCs was opposite to that of Nrf2 in the liver. Both DAPI staining and Merge images demonstrated that TCS induced oxidative phosphorylation, and phosphorylated Nrf2 is translocated into the nucleus as the transcription factor to regulate gene transcription in liver and brain. Nrf2 over-expression increased accumulation of  droplets in yolk, brain and liver, resulting from the upregulation of pri-miR-125b1, pri-miR-125b3, but not pri-miR-125b2. These findings reveal the upstream regulation mechanism of miR-125b for TCS-induced  disorder from the regulatory perspective of the pri-miR-125b promoter region.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Low carnitine availability may contribute to metabolic inflexibility and impaired glucose tolerance. Here, we investigated whether carnitine supplementation improves metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity in impaired glucose tolerant (IGT) volunteers.Eleven IGT- volunteers followed a 36-day placebo- and L-carnitine treatment ( g/day) in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind crossover design. A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (40 mU/m/min), combined with indirect calorimetry (ventilated hood) was performed to determine insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility. Furthermore, metabolic flexibility was assessed in response to a high-energy meal. Skeletal muscle acetylcarnitine concentrations were measured in vivo using long echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS, TE=500 ms) in the resting state (7:00AM and 5:00PM) and after a 30-min cycling exercise. Twelve normal glucose tolerant (NGT) volunteers were included without any intervention as control group.Metabolic flexibility of IGT-subjects completely restored towards NGT control values upon carnitine supplementation, measured during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and meal test. In muscle, carnitine supplementation enhanced the increase in resting acetylcarnitine concentrations over the day (delta 7:00 AM versus 5:00 PM) in IGT-subjects. Furthermore, carnitine supplementation increased post-exercise acetylcarnitine concentrations and reduced long-chain acylcarnitine species in IGT-subjects, suggesting the stimulation of a more complete  oxidation in muscle. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was not affected.Carnitine supplementation improves acetylcarnitine formation and rescues metabolic flexibility in IGT-subjects.

Pin1 interacts with the motif containing phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro of substrates and enhances cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds, thereby controlling the functions of these substrates. Importantly, the Pin1 expression level is highly upregulated in most cancer cells and correlates with malignant properties, and thereby with poor outcomes. In addition, Pin1 was revealed to promote the functions of multiple oncogenes and to abrogate tumor suppressors. Accordingly, Pin1 is well recognized as a master regulator of malignant processes. Recent studies have shown that Pin1 also binds to a variety of metabolic regulators, such as AMP-activated protein kinase, acetyl CoA carboxylase and pyruvate kinase2, indicating Pin1 to have major impacts on  and glucose  in cancer cells. In this review, we focus on the roles of Pin1 in metabolic reprogramming, such as "Warburg effects", of cancer cells. Our aim is to introduce these important roles of Pin1, as well as to present evidence supporting the possibility of Pin1 inhibition as a novel anti-cancer strategy.Copyright © 2019.

The hyperlipidemia models were successfully made by high- diet for 12 weeks in male SD rats,and then divided into model control group and DJC treatment groups( 500 and 1 000 mg·kg~(-1)·d-1) via gavage administration for additional 8 weeks.The levels of serum  and liver  indices were detected; HE and oil red O staining were used to observe the pathological changes of liver. Expression levels of extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/( ERK1/),c-Jun N-terminal kinase( JNK),and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase( p38 MAPK) were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction( RT-PCR). Expression of MCP-1,phosphorylated ERK( p-ERK),phosphorylated JNK( p-JNK),and phosphorylated p38 MAPK( p-p38) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The results showed that DJC decreased body weight and serum levels of total cholesterol( TC),triglyceride( TG),alanine aminotransferase( ALT),aspartate aminotransferase( AST),increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol( HDL-C) level,ameliorate injury and  deposition in the liver induced by the high- diet,decreased mRNA expression of ERK1/,JNK and p-38 MAPK as well as protein expression of p-ERK,p-JNK,p-p38,and MCP-1,somewhat showing a dose-dependent effect. Therefore,DJC has an obvious protective effect on liver of hyperlipidemic rats with certain dose-dependent effect,and the mechanism may be related with inhibiting MAPK pathways and inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594997>Modulation of PTH1R signaling by an ECD binding antibody results in inhibition of β-arrestin  coupling.</a></h1><p>Parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTH1R) belongs to the secretin class of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and natively binds parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP). Ligand binding to PTH1R involves binding to the large extracellular domain (ECD) and the orthosteric pocket, inducing conformational changes in the transmembrane domain and receptor activation. PTH1R regulates bone , signaling mainly through G and G G-proteins. Here, we used phage display to generate PTH1R ECD-specific antibodies with the aim of modulating receptor functionality. We identified ECD-scFvhFc, which exhibited high affinity binding to both the isolated ECD and to the full-length receptor in styrene-maleic acid (SMA)  particles. Epitope mapping using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) indicates that the α1 helix of the ECD is ECD-scFvhFc's epitope which may partially overlap with the known PTH (1-34) binding site. However, PTH (1-34)-mediated G activation is Undisturbed by ECD-scFvhFc binding. In contrast, ECD-scFvhFc potently inhibits β-arrestin- recruitment after PTH (1-34)-driven receptor activation and thus represents the first monoclonal antibody to selectively inhibit distinct PTH1R signaling pathways. Given the complexity of PTH1R signaling and the emerging importance of biased GPCR activation in drug development, ECD-scFvhFc could be a valuable tool to study PTH1R signaling bias.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598388>The expanded role of fatty acid  in cancer: new aspects and targets.</a></h1><p>Cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to support cell proliferation, growth, and dissemination.

However, to date, no studies have directly compared the effects of these two drugs on the components of the metabolic syndrome in patients with type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM).The Comparison of Canagliflozin vs. Teneligliptin against Basic Metabolic Risks in Patients with T2DM (CANTABILE) study aims to examine whether the DPP-4 inhibitor (teneligliptin) or the SGLT2 inhibitor (canagliflozin) is the more effective drug for reducing metabolic risk factors as a composite in Japanese patients with T2DM.The CANTABILE study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group comparison study. A total of 200 patients with T2DM treated with metformin alone or without glucose-lowering agents will be enrolled if they have one or more of the metabolic risk factors, such as obesity, borderline high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia. They will then will be randomized into the Teneligliptin group or the Canagliflozin group and treated for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the composite ratio of subjects with one or more improved metabolic risk factors.

Total [<6; ≥6 months] and predominant [<3; ≥3 months] breastfeeding were recalled using questionnaires. Diet were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. DP obtained by factor analysis by principal component were categorized into tertiles of adherence (T1 = reference). Glucose and  biomarkers were categorized into tertiles (T1 + T2 = reference). Logistic regression was applied considering minimal sufficient adjustment recommended by directed acyclic graphs.Median (interquartile range) age and BMI were 23.0 (20.0; 28.5) years and 22.6 (20.7; 25.4) kg/m, respectively. Mean ± SD values of glucose, LDL-c and HDL-c were 82.0 ± 9.0, 101.1 ± 29.6 and 54.4 ± 12.4 mg/dL, respectively. Women breastfed for <6 months had higher chance of being classified into T3 of insulin (OR = .87; 95%CI = 1.28-6.40).

Success in managing CVD risk factors was evaluated as follows: (1) glucose control (haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] <7.0% in patients aged <65years and <8.0% in patients aged ≥65years), () blood pressure control (<140/90mmHg), and (3)  control (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥1.0mmol/L in men and ≥1.3mmol/L in women, and triglycerides <1.7mmol/L).During a median 8.0-year follow-up, 206 CVD incident cases were identified. Each 1% increment in HbA1c, 10mmHg increment in systolic blood pressure (SBP), and 1mmol/L increment in triglycerides during follow-up significantly increased the risk of CVD by 17%, 37%, and 14%, respectively. Compared to those who did not, patients who met the blood pressure and glucose control goals during follow-up had a 64% and a 29% decreased risk of CVD, respectively.

Reactive oxygen species play a key role in the regulation of adipogenesis and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by adipocytes. Quercetin (QCT) regulates adipogenesis by affecting the redox state of preadipocytes. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins contaminating food. It has cytotoxic, genotoxic, pro-inflammatory, and anti-adipogenic effects. Antioxidants are believed to protect cells from the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induced by OTA. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of QCT and OTA application on preadipocyte differentiation, oxidative status, and adipocyte . () Methods: Primary rat preadipocytes were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue of Wistar rats. Gene expressions were determined by qPCR. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, glucose uptake, and  accumulation were determined using commercially available kits. (3) Results: A dose-dependent inhibitory effect of QCT on adipogenic differentiation was observed, which was accompanied by a decrease in ROS production. Reduced ROS formation is closely related to impaired glucose uptake by adipocytes.

Patients were divided into four subgroups. The groups were as follows: patients with less than or equal to 12 ng/ml (group 1, =126) vitamin D levels, between 20 and 12 ng/ml (group , =48), between 30 and 20 ng/ml (group 3, =21), and at least 30 ng/ml (group 4, =120) vitamin D levels. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and non-HDL-C levels of the four groups were compared.HDL-C levels of group 4 were the highest (=0.03), and TG and non-HDL-C levels of group 1 were the highest (=0.04, 0.016, respectively) in all groups. There was no significant difference between serum parathormone, calcium, and phosphorus levels of the four groups (=0.778, 0.121, 0.184, respectively). In unadjusted analysis, 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were found to be correlated negatively with BMI (=0.0005), LDL-C (=0.01), and non-HDL-C (=0.003) and correlated positively with HDL-C levels (=0.006).

The mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA regulate biological processes begins with an understanding of the n-3 biosynthetic pathway that starts with alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) and is commonly thought to end with the production of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3). However, our understanding of this pathway is not as complete as previously believed. In the current review we provide a background of the evidence supporting the pathway as currently understood and provide updates from recent studies challenging three central dogma of n-3 PUFA . By building on nearly three decades of research primarily in cell culture and oral dosing studies, recent evidence presented focuses on in vivo kinetic modelling and compound-specific isotope abundance studies in rodents and humans that have been instrumental in expanding our knowledge of the pathway. Specifically, we highlight three main updates to the n-3 PUFA biosynthesis pathway: (1) DHA synthesis rates cannot be as low as previously believed, () DHA is both a product and a precursor to tetracosahexaenoic acid (24:6n-3) and (3) increases in EPA in response to DHA supplementation are not the result of increased retroconversion.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we used hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced injury in human hepatic L02 cells to investigate the mechanisms involved in the hepatoprotective activity of γ-oryzanol. The injuries produced by HO in L02 cells include increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased protein expressions of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with γ-oryzanol enhanced the ROS scavenging activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreased  peroxidation in HO treated cells. Moreover, pretreatment with γ-oryzanol inhibited HO-induced apoptosis by restoring MMP, upregulating the expression ratio of Bcl-/Bax, and inhibiting the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. These findings show that γ-oryzanol can prevent HO-induced apoptosis by suppressing intracellular accumulation of ROS and impeding ROS-activated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We tested the hypothesis that high amounts of upper VAT (aVAT) and low-quality VAT worsen treatment outcomes via altered insulin .Cohort 1 included 106 women with breast cancer who were undergoing surgery. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-R), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) were measured before the initiation of treatment. aVAT was measured via computed tomography (CT). VAT quality was assessed using CT-determined Hounsfield units (VAT-HU). Associations between the variables investigated and VAT quality and quantity were analyzed. Cohort  included 271 patients who underwent chemotherapy. Associations between the variables investigated and survival outcomes after chemotherapy were analyzed via retrospective chart review.In cohort 1, aVAT was significantly correlated with insulin and HOMA-R levels. As body mass index (BMI) class increased, mean IGF-1 increased and mean IGFBP3 decreased, but these trends were not statistically significant. In cohort , aVAT was significantly positively correlated with BMI. The patients in the third aVAT tertiles had significantly shorter distant disease-free survival (dDFS) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting. In multivariate analysis, aVAT and VAT-HU were significantly associated with shorter dDFS.High aVAT and low-quality VAT were associated with poor survival outcome, increased insulin levels, and insulin resistance.

We aimed to determine the in vivo net energy content of RS and examine its effect on macronutrient oxidation. This was a randomized, double-blind cross-over study. Eighteen healthy adults spent 24 h in a whole room indirect calorimeter to measure total energy expenditure (TEE), substrate oxidation, and postprandial metabolites in response to three diets: 1) digestible starch (DS), ) RS (33% dietary fiber; RS), or 3) RS with high fiber (RSF, 56% fiber). The in vivo net energy content of RS and RSF are .74 ± 0.41 and 3.16 ± 0.27 kcal/g, respectively. There was no difference in TEE or protein oxidation between DS, RS, and RSF. However, RS and RSF consumption caused a 32% increase in  oxidation ( = 0.04) with a concomitant 18% decrease in carbohydrate oxidation ( = 0.03) versus DS. Insulin responses were unaltered after breakfast but lower in RS and RSF after lunch, at equivalent glucose concentrations, indicating improved insulin sensitivity. The average in vivo net energy content of RS is .95 kcal/g, regardless of dietary fiber content. RS and RSF consumption increase  and decrease carbohydrate oxidation with postprandial insulin responses lowered after lunch, suggesting improved insulin sensitivity at subsequent meals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655012>Hypocretin/orexin modulates body weight and the  of glucose and insulin.</a></h1><p>The hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt/orexin) unit affects the functions of several organ systems including the nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and the reproductive systems. This review examines the tissue distribution of the hcrt/orexin system and the variety of biological activities attributed to it. Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to obesity, and insulin and glucose . Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin  receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein  and glucagon. Literature reports show that hcrt/orexin can significantly increase insulin secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreata. Moreover, several studies reported that the tissue expression of glucose transporter type 4 is markedly higher after treatment with orexin. Hcrt/orexin also decreases blood glucose concentration and reduces insulin resistance. It reduces obesity by increasing browning of  cells and energy expenditure. Taken together, hcrt/orexin modulates obesity and the  of glucose and insulin. The Hcrt/orexin system may thus be a target in the development of new therapies for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.This article is protected by copyright.

Leptin treatment with metreleptin in lipodystrophy decreases insulin resistance and lowers triglycerides without changing high-density lipoprotein. Detailed measurement of lipoprotein particles with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can offer insights into cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and  beyond a standard  panel. We hypothesized that patients with lipodystrophy would have a more atherogenic  profile than controls at baseline, which would be ameliorated with metreleptin treatment.To characterize the lipoprotein profile in patients with lipodystrophy compared with controls and to evaluate effects of metreleptin treatment.Patients with lipodystrophy (N = 17) were studied before and after metreleptin for  weeks and 6 months and compared with 51 insulin-sensitive sex-matched controls.Lipoprotein profiles were measured by NMR with the LP4 deconvolution algorithm, which reports triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles (TRLPs), high-density lipoprotein particles (HDLPs), and low-density lipoprotein particles (LDLPs).Patients with lipodystrophy had elevated large TRLPs and smaller HDLPs and LDLPs compared with controls. Five patients with lipodystrophy had chylomicrons, compared with zero controls. Metreleptin decreased the size and concentration of TRLPs, eliminated chylomicrons in all but one patient, decreased LDLPs, and increased LDLP size. Metreleptin treatment did not have major effects on HDLPs.Patients with lipodystrophy had an atherogenic lipoprotein profile at baseline consistent with elevated CVD risk, which improved after metreleptin treatment. The presence of fasting chylomicrons in a subset of patients with lipodystrophy suggests saturation of chylomicron clearance by lipoprotein lipase.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651077>Metabolomic Profiling to Identify Molecular Biomarkers of Cellular Response to Methotrexate In Vitro.</a></h1><p>Variation in methotrexate (MTX) efficacy represents a significant barrier to early and effective disease control in the treatment of autoimmune arthritis. We hypothesize that the utilization of metabolomic techniques will allow for an improved understanding of the biochemical basis for the pharmacological activity of MTX, and can promote the identification and evaluation of novel molecular biomarkers of MTX response. In this work, erythroblastoid cells were exposed to MTX at the physiologic concentration of 1,000 nM and analyzed using three metabolomic platforms to give a broad spectrum of cellular metabolites. MTX pharmacological activity, defined as cellular growth inhibition, was associated with an altered cellular metabolomic profile based on the analysis of 724 identified metabolites. By discriminant analysis, MTX treatment was associated with increases in ketoisovaleric acid, fructose, galactose, and -deoxycytidine, and corresponding reductions in -deoxyuridine, phosphatidylinositol 32:0, orotic acid, and inosine monophosphate. Inclusion of data from analysis of folate  in combination with chemometric and metabolic network analysis demonstrated that MTX treatment is associated with dysregulated folate  and nucleotide biosynthesis, which is in line with its known mechanism of action. However, MTX treatment was also associated with alterations in a diversity of metabolites, including intermediates of amino acid, carbohydrate, and . Collectively, these findings support a robust metabolic response following exposure to physiologic concentrations of MTX. They also identify various metabolic intermediates that are associated with the pharmacological activity of MTX, and are, therefore, potential molecular biomarker candidates in future preclinical and clinical studies of MTX efficacy in autoimmune arthritis.© 2019 The Authors.

Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence of positive islet autoimmunity in T2DM community patients.495 community patients with T2DM were recruited totally using the method of Cluster sampling in this cross-sectional study. Three islet autoantibodies including GADA, IAA and ICA were measured, and clinical characteristics involved in those individuals were evaluated.The positive rate of islet autoantibodies was 28.5% in total. Compared with GADA negative group, positive counterparts significantly tended to have lower levels of BMI, WHR, and mALB. Adjusted for confounding factors, WHR, Triglycerides (TG), mALB seemed to be negative independent predictors of GADA. Patients with positive IAA tended to receive insulin treatment (P<0.0001). Besides, FBG, HDL-CH, AST, and GGT were more likely to be higher in IAA positive subgroup in comparison with the negative counterparts. While after AST was adjusted by unconditional logistic regression analysis, history of insulin treatment, FBG, HDL-CH, and GGT were confirmed as positive predictors of IAA. Furthermore, in patients with IAA positive, those treated with exogenous insulin tended to have longer duration of diabetes than non-insulin treatment counterparts. With regard to ICA, however, there were no significant differences between the two subgroups, except that serum level of AST/ALT seemed to be slightly different (P=0.064).These data suggested thatT2DM community patients with positive GADA tended to be lean and were able to maintain normal , while patients with positivity of IAA were frequently accompanied with insulin treatment and more closely associated with diabetic liver damage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673759> oxidation at rest and during exercise in male monozygotic twins.</a></h1><p>We aimed to investigate if hereditary factors, leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and metabolic health interact with resting  oxidation (RFO) and peak  oxidation (PFO) during ergometer cycling.We recruited 23 male monozygotic twin pairs (aged 32-37 years) and determined their RFO and PFO with indirect calorimetry for 21 and 19 twin pairs and for 43 and 41 twin individuals, respectively. Using physical activity interviews and the Baecke questionnaire, we identified 10 twin pairs as LTPA discordant for the past 3 years. Of the twin pairs, 8 pairs participated in both RFO and PFO measurements, and  pairs participated in either of the measurements. We quantified the participants' metabolic health with a -h oral glucose tolerance test. oxidation within co-twins was correlated at rest [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.78] and during exercise (ICC = 0.67, 95% CI 0.33-0.86). The LTPA-discordant pairs had no pairwise differences in RFO or PFO. In the twin individual-based analysis, PFO was positively correlated with the past 12-month LTPA (r = 0.26, p = 0.034) and the Baecke score (r = 0.40, p = 0.022) and negatively correlated with the area under the curve of insulin (r = - 0.42, p = 0.015) and glucose (r = - 0.31, p = 0.050) during the oral glucose tolerance test.Hereditary factors were more important than LTPA for determining  oxidation at rest and during exercise.

Unhealthy dietary habits and physical inactivity are traditionally considered as responsible factors for these disorders. The relatively new concept of foetal programming suggests that development of metabolic diseases later in life may be associated with poor nutritional status , and such phenomenon could be amplified by subsequent exposure to unhealthy diets after birth. We suggest that foetal programming and mismatched nutritional situations during foetal and postnatal life are important causative factors for increased prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorders in Nepal. Issues highlighted in this paper may also be relevant to other developing countries with similar socioeconomic status. Undernutrition in foetal life can predispose for visceral  deposition and may alter dietary preferences towards unhealthy diets, amplifying the risk of nutritional mismatch after birth; this can lead to metabolic disturbances in a number of pathways including glucose and . Providing attention to early life nutrition could therefore be an important tool to reduce the prevalence of lifestyle diseases in Nepal. Future national health policies should thus include changes in research and intervention activities towards preventing averse early life nutritional programming. Availability of free-of-cost and mandatory nutritional education and medical services to pregnant women and their families and better management of national health care systems including digitalization of national health data could be viable strategies to achieve these goals.Copyright © 2019 by The Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610611>Tissue Distribution, Growth Dilution and Species-specific Bioaccumulation of Organic Ultraviolet Absorbents in Wildlife Freshwater Fish in the Pearl River Catchment, China.</a></h1><p>Tissue distributions, body-size dependent and species-specific bioaccumulation of 12 organic ultraviolet absorbents (UVAs) were investigated in 9 species of wildlife freshwater fish from the Pearl River (PR) catchment, South China. The concentration of 12 UVAs summed from 109 to 2320 ng/g  weight (lw) in the fish tissue samples. -hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (BP-3), octocrylene (OCR), UV531, and 5 benzotriazole UV stabilizers (UVP, UV329, UV234, UV328, and UV327) were detected in more than half of the fish tissue samples. UV531 showed obvious potential of bioaccumulation in the wild freshwater fish with an estimated bioaccumulation factor (LogBAF) and a bio-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) of 4.54 ± 0.55 and 4.88 ± 6.78, respectively. Generally, liver (989±464 ng/g lw) contained the highest level of the UVAs, followed in decreasing order by belly  (599±318 ng/g lw), swimming bladder (494±282 ng/g lw), dorsal muscle (470±240 ng/g lw), and egg (442±238 ng/g lw). The UVAs bioaccumulation in the freshwater wild fish showed species-specific and compound - dependent. Bottom-dwelling detritus ingesting omnivorous fish contained obviously higher UVA concentrations, suggesting detritus/sediment ingestion a significant pathway for exposure of the wild freshwater fish to the UVAs. UV531 and BP-3 demonstrated potential of growth dilution.  might play a significant role in elimination of the UVAs in the fish tissues, with the highest rate of  in liver. The UVAs did not demonstrate obviously trophic magnification in the freshwater ecosystem of the PR catchment. More research is warranted to elucidate maternal transfer of the UVAs in organisms.

It acts in a variety of organs and disease states ranging from cancer progression over neuropathic pain to neurodegeneration. Protein components engaged in the signaling, trafficking, and homeostasis machinery of the G-protein coupled CB2, are however largely unknown. It is therefore important to identify further interaction partners to better understand CB2 receptor functions in physiology and pathophysiology. For this purpose, we used an affinity purification and mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach of Strep-HA-CB2 receptor in HEK293 cells. After subtraction of background interactions and protein frequency library assessment we could identify 83 proteins that were classified by the identification of minimally  unique peptides as highly probable interactors. A functional protein association network analysis obtained an interaction network with a significant enrichment of proteins functionally involved in protein metabolic process, in endoplasmic reticulum, response to stress but also in  and membrane organization. The network especially contains proteins involved in biosynthesis and trafficking like calnexin, Sec61A, tubulin chains TUBA1C and TUBB2B, TMED2, and TMED10. Six proteins that were only expressed in stable CB2 expressing cells were DHC24, DHRS7, GGT7, HECD3, KIAA2013, and PLS1. To exemplify the validity of our approach, we chose a candidate having a relatively low number of edges in the network to increase the likelihood of a direct protein interaction with CB2 and focused on the scaffold/phagosomal protein p62/SQSTM1. Indeed, we independently confirmed the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemical colocalization studies. 3D reconstruction of confocal images furthermore showed CB2 localization in close proximity to p62 positive vesicles at the cell membrane. In summary, we provide a comprehensive repository of the CB2 interactome in HEK293 cells identified by a systematic unbiased approach, which can be used in future experiments to decipher the signaling and trafficking complex of this cannabinoid receptor. Future studies will have to analyze the exact mechanism of the p62-CB2 interaction as well as its putative role in disease pathophysiology.Copyright © 2019 Sharaf, Mensching, Keller, Rading, Scheffold, Palkowitsch, Djogo, Rezgaoui, Kestler, Moepps, Failla and Karsak.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678218>Skeletal muscle  in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy adults.</a></h1><p>To compare skeletal muscle  (SMF), intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) between individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and healthy individuals of the same age, and healthy individuals at least 10 years older than those with RA.Two cross-sectional studies.

Two and seven days of forearm immobilization led to a 40±7% and 52±7% decrease in FGU, respectively (P<0.001), with no difference between day  and 7 and no effect of HFD. Forearm NEFA balance tended to increase following two and seven days of immobilization (P=0.095).forearm immobilization leads to a rapid and substantial decrease in FGU, which is accompanied by an increase in forearm NEFA balance but is not exacerbated by excess dietary  intake. Altogether, our data suggest that disuse-induced insulin resistance of glucose  is occurs as a physiological adaptation in response to the removal of muscle contraction.© Endocrine Society 2019.

However, SGA treatment is associated with severe metabolic alterations and body weight gain, which can increase the risk of type  diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that metabolic changes in insulin-sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the metabolic disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole-body glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG,  dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on insulin signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and insulin secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648126>Effect of Marantodes pumilum Blume (Kuntze) var.alata on β-cell function and insulin signaling in ovariectomised diabetic rats.</a></h1><p>Oestrogen deficiency leads to metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance and impairment of adipose tissue or . Marantodes pumilum (Blume) Kuntze (Primulaceae) is believed to have phytoestrogenic properties and is claimed to have beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM), but the mechanism behind its phytoestrogenic effects on estrogen-deficient diabetic condition have not been fully examined.The present study investigated the effects of oral treatment with M. pumilum var. alata (MPA) extracts on the estrogen receptor, metabolic characteristics and insulin signaling pathway in pancreas and liver of ovariectomised nicotidamide streptozotocin-induced diabetes in female rats.Ovariectomised diabetic (OVXS) Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered with either aqueous leaf extract and ethanol (50%) stem-root extract of MPA (50 or 100 mg/kg) respectively for 28 days. Metabolic parameters were evaluated by measuring fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, oral glucose and insulin tolerance test. Distribution and expression level of insulin, oxidative stress and inflammatory marker in the pancreatic islets and liver were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot, respectively.Oral treatment with aqueous leaf and ethanol (50%) stem-root extracts of MPA (100 mg/kg) significantly reversed the elevated fasting blood glucose, impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. The protein expression of insulin, glucose transporter (GLUT- and GLUT-4) increased in the pancreatic islets and liver. Furthermore, marked improvement in the tissue morphology following treatment with MPA was observed. Similarly, the western blots analysis denotes improved insulin signaling in the liver and decreased reactive oxygen species producing enzymes, inflammatory and pro-apoptotic molecules with MPA treatment.Taken together, this work demonstrate that 100 mg/kg of aqueous leaf extract and ethanol (50%) stem-root extract of MPA improves β-cell function and insulin signaling in postmenopausal diabetes through attenuation of oxidative stress and partially mediated by oestrogen receptor stimulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor  (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in NAFLD.Human liver biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by liver fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of liver biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and liver assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total liver cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile acid output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in liver glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/ as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in liver.These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related  conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Skin represents the largest organ of the body that is exposed to  peroxidation. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of oxidative stress in the development of lichen planus (LP), a chronic inflammatory skin condition with a complex pathogenesis. The aim of our study is to investigate a panel of pro-oxidants (4-hydroxy-nonenal (4-HNE), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and malondialdehyde (MDA)), the total antioxidant status (TAS), and thiol-disulfide homeostasis parameters (TDHP), including total thiol (TT), native thiol (NT), disulfides (DS), DS/NT ratio, DS/TT ratio, and NT/TT ratio. The comparative determinations of serum levels of 4-HNE, TBARS, and MDA in patients with LP ( = 31) and controls ( = 26) show significant differences between the two groups (4-HNE: 7.81 ± 1.96 µg/mL vs. 6.15 ± 1.17 µg/mL,  < 0.05, TBARS: 4.23 ± 0.59 µmol/L vs. 1.99 ± 0.23 µmol/L,  < 0.05, MDA: 32.3 ± 6.26 ng/mL vs. 21.26 ± .36 ng/mL).

This work aims to characterize adipocyte phenotype and expression profile of genes in the regulation of  and glucose  in visceral adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle. From mating until weaning, a recommended dose of folic acid for pregnancy (C,  mg of folic acid per kg of diet) or a high folic acid dose (HFA, 40 mg of folic acid per kg of diet) was administered to Sprague-Dawley females. At 10 months of age progeny were divided into groups fed the standard chow (C/STD and HFA/STD) and groups fed the standard chow plus drinking water with 10% fructose (C/FRU and HFA/FRU), as an additional metabolic challenge. Adipocyte morphology and quantification of key genes involved in  and glucose  were studied in visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of 13 months old offspring. HFA exposure led to an enlargement of visceral adipose cells most likely mediated by an upregulation of lipoprotein lipase, and it tended to downregulate Glut4 in visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Fructose exposure in a background of perigestational excess folic acid, but not in controls, induced an upregulation of lipogenesis pathway genes and it decreased jejunal expression of the proton-coupled folate transporter (Pcft1). In addition, fructose exposure led to a downregulation of jejunal Sglt1 in control animals. Our data suggest that high folic acid exposure during the perigestational period caused morphologic and genic alterations related to insulin resistant states indicating that this intervention may act as an effective programmer of long-term metabolic dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672126>Association of physical activity with adiposity in preschoolers using different clinical adiposity measures: a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>More research is needed about the association between physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviour (SB), and adiposity in preschoolers, particularly using more direct clinical measures of adiposity. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity measures in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal-weight (77%) -6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (p < 0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (p > 0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal-weight population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of body  in preschoolers. The role of vigorous PA in the prevention of early childhood obesity should be further investigated in future studies.ISRCTN ISRCTN41045021 .

Evidence suggests that BBR ameliorates palmitate-induced  deposition and apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which tracks in tandem with the enhancement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha). The study aim was to investigate the roles of BBR in renal lipotoxicity in vitro, and investigate whether PPAR-alpha was the underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS Human TECs (HK- cells) were injured with palmitic acid (PA), and then treated with BBR, BBR+PPAR-alpha inhibitor (GW6471), and PA+PPAR-alpha agonist (fenofibrate). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was assessed by measuring the expression of prospective evaluation of radial keratotomy (PERK), C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), and 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78).  was assessed by determining  anabolism-associated genes, including fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), as well as  catabolism-associated gene, including carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Inflammatory response of HK- cells was evaluated by measuring interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Cell apoptosis and protein levels of cleaved-caspase-3 were evaluated. RESULTS PA downregulated PPAR-alpha and induced server lipotoxicity in HK- cells by ER stress, increasing  deposition, and elevating inflammatory response of HK- cells accompanied with inducting cell apoptosis and cleaved-caspase-3, which were obviously reversed by additional treatment of BBR or PPAR-alpha agonist. However, the protective effect of BBR in PA-induced lipotoxicity in HK- cells was significantly ameliorated by PPAR-alpha inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS BBR attenuated PA-induced lipotoxicity via the PPAR-alpha pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612375>Genome-wide identification and characterization of the AMPK genes and their distinct expression patterns in response to air exposure in the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum).</a></h1><p>AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPK) are heterotrimeric complexes. The main upstream phosphorylase has AMP-dependent LKB1 and Ca-dependent CaMKK beta. AMPK also includes an auto-inhibitory domain and a region associated with beta and gamma subunits, which regulate a variety of cellular activities and energy . The increase in the ratio of AMP/ATP can stimulate the activation of AMPK. Once AMPK is activated, pathways to ATP consumption (e.g., , cholesterol, and protein synthesis) will be shut down. The pathway to ATP generation (e.g., oxidation of  and glycolysis pathway) will be activated. AMPK genes have not been systematically characterized in marine invertebrates.In this study, we identified and characterized three AMPK genes, AMPK-α, AMPK-β, and AMPK-γ, in the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum). To gain insight into the role of AMPK genes during clam energy , quantitative real-time PCR was used to investigate the expression profiles in the different stages of clam development, in healthy adult tissues, and after air exposure at two different temperatures.Phylogenetic and protein structural analyses were conducted to determine the identity and evolutionary relationships of these genes. The structural features of the genes were relatively well-conserved, relative to the AMPK genes of other vertebrates. The expression of genes was significantly induced 3-48 h after air exposure.AMPK-α, AMPK-β and AMPK-γ are involved in clam energy . Increased expression levels of AMPK genes in the gill and intestine of Manila clam in response to air exposure implied a strong adaptability to the coastal environment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602953>[Mechanism of Calculus Bovis Sativus in inhibiting hepatocyte  deposition based on serum pharmacology].</a></h1><p>The aim of this paper was to investigate the molecular mechanism of Calculus Bovis Sativus( CBS) in alleviating  accumulation in vitro by serum pharmacology. The CBS-containing serum of mice was obtained by serum pharmacology method to evaluate its effect on the proliferation of LO2 hepatocytes. The  reducing effects of CBS-containing serum through Nrf2 was evaluated by fructose-induced LO2 hepatocyte steatosis model,nuclear factor erythroid  related factor ( Nrf2) agonist oltipraz combined intervention,cell oil red O staining and intracellular triglyceride( TG) content. The effects of CBS-containing serum on  peroxidation and hepatocytes apoptosis were evaluated by reactive oxygen species( ROS) and apoptosis assay,respectively. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction( PCR) was used to detect the relative expression of  synthesis-related genes and apoptosis-related genes.RESULTS:: showed that CBS drug-containing serum had no significant effect on LO2 hepatocyte proliferation. As compared with the model group,CBS-containing serum could effectively reduce the formation of  droplets in fructose-induced LO2 hepatocytes,significantly reduce intracellular TG and ROS levels,and significantly reduce hepatocyte apoptosis rate( P < 0. 05). As compared with the model group,carbohydrate responsive element binding protein( ChREBP),sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 c( SREBP-1 c),fatty acid synthase( FAS),acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1( ACC1),stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1( SCD1),Bax and caspase-3 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in CBS drug-containing serum treatment group( P<0. 05). All of the above effects could be reversed by oltipraz.In conclusion,CBS-containing serum can significantly inhibit the fructose-induced LO2 liver  deposition,and the mechanism may be related to reducing intracellular ROS level through the Nrf2 pathway and improving intracellular peroxidation state to reduce apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606738>A role for Oncostatin M in the impairment of glucose homeostasis in obesity.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of OSM with the inflammatory state that leads to impaired glucose homeostasis in obesity. We also assessed whether OSM immunoneutralization could revert metabolic disturbances caused by a high- diet (HFD) in mice.28 patients with severe obesity were included and stratified into two groups: 1) glucose levels < 100 mg/dL and ) glucose levels > 100 mg/dL. White adipose tissue was obtained to examine OSM gene expression. Human adipocytes were used to evaluate the effect of OSM in the inflammatory response, and HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice were injected with anti-OSM antibody to evaluate its effects.OSM expression was elevated in subcutaneous and visceral  from patients with obesity and hyperglycemia, and correlated with Glut4 mRNA levels, serum insulin, HOMA-IR, and inflammatory markers. OSM inhibited adipogenesis and induced inflammation in human adipocytes. Finally, OSM receptor knockout mice had increased Glut4 mRNA levels in adipose tissue, and OSM immunoneutralization resulted in a reduction of glucose levels and Ccl2 expression in adipose tissue from HFD-fed mice.OSM contributes to the inflammatory state during obesity and may be involved in the development of insulin resistance.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Herein, we aim to develop a prognosis-prediction tool based on an immune- signature, tumor cell-associated immune microenvironment, and  proteins inferred from the function of gut microbiota.16S gene ribosomal RNA sequencing was performed on 10 fecal samples obtained after tumor resection but before chemotherapy (EBVaGC = 4 and EBVnGC = 6). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was applied to screening for highly accurate marker proteins. A compound score based on the fraction of screened markers was then constructed using a LASSO logistic regression model.The Tax4Fun analysis based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes data indicated differentially expressed tumor pathway between EBVnGC and EBVaGC. Using the LASSO logistic model, a compound score was established consisting of 14 types of immune microenvironment and  proteins. In the training set (378 patients), significant differences were found between high- and low-compound score groups in overall survival across and within subpopulations with an identical EBV. Multivariable analysis revealed that the compound score was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio, .26; 95% confidence interval = .28-3.36). The prognostic value ;of the compound score was also confirmed in the validation (162 patients) and entire (540 patients) sets.The proposed compound score is a promising signature for estimating overall survival in patients with gastric cancer having EBVaGCs or EBVnGCs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641049>Sphingosine kinase  potentiates amyloid deposition but protects against hippocampal volume loss and demyelination in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h1><p>Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent vasculoprotective and neuroprotective signalling , synthesized primarily by sphingosine kinase  (SK2) in the brain. We have reported pronounced loss of S1P and SK2 activity early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and an inverse correlation between hippocampal S1P levels and age in females, leading us to speculate that loss of S1P is a sensitizing influence for AD. Paradoxically, SK2 was reported to mediate amyloid β (Aβ) formation from amyloid precursor protein (APP)  To determine if loss of S1P sensitizes to Aβ-mediated neurodegeneration, we investigated whether SK2 deficiency worsens pathology and memory in male J20 (PDGFB-APP) mice. SK2 deficiency greatly reduced Aβ content in J20 mice, associated with significant improvements in epileptiform activity and cross-frequency coupling measured by hippocampal electroencephalography. However, several key measures of APP-dependent neurodegeneration were enhanced on the SK2 null background, despite reduced Aβ burden. These included hippocampal volume loss, oligodendrocyte attrition and myelin loss, and impaired performance in Y-maze and social novelty memory tests. Inhibition of the endosomal cholesterol exporter NPC1 greatly reduced sphingosine phosphorylation in glial cells, linking loss of SK2 activity and S1P in AD to perturbed endosomal . Our findings establish SK2 as an important endogenous regulator of both APP processing to Aβ, and oligodendrocyte survival,  These results urge greater consideration of the roles played by oligodendrocyte dysfunction and altered membrane  metabolic flux as drivers of neurodegeneration in AD.Genetic, neuropathological, and functional studies implicate both Aβ and altered  and/or signalling as key pathogenic drivers of AD. In this study, we firstly demonstrate that the enzyme SK2, which generates the signalling  S1P, is required for Aβ formation from APP  Secondly, we establish a new role for SK2 in the protection of oligodendrocytes and myelin. Loss of SK2 sensitizes to Aβ-mediated neurodegeneration by attenuating oligodendrocyte survival and promoting hippocampal atrophy, despite reduced Aβ burden. Our findings support a model in which Aβ-independent sensitizing influences such as loss of neuroprotective S1P are more important drivers of neurodegeneration than gross Aβ concentration or plaque density.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652237>Impact of Exercise-Nutritional State Interactions in Patients with Type  Diabetes.</a></h1><p>This study examines the role of nutritional status during exercise training in patients with type  diabetes mellitus by investigating the impact of endurance-type exercise training in the fasted versus the fed state on clinical outcome measures, glycemic control, and skeletal muscle characteristics in male type  diabetes patients.Twenty-five male patients (HbA1c 57±3 mmol/mol (7.4±0.3%)) participated in a randomized 12-week supervised endurance-type exercise intervention, with exercise being performed in an overnight fasted state (FastEx, n=13) or after consuming breakfast (FedEx, n=12). Patients were evaluated for glycemic control, blood  profiles, body composition and physical fitness, and skeletal muscle gene expression.Exercise training was well tolerated without any incident of hypoglycemia. Exercise training significantly decreased whole-body  mass (-1.6kg) and increased HDL concentrations (+2mg*dL), physical fitness (+1.7mL*min*kg) and  oxidation during exercise in both groups (PTIME<0.05), with no between group differences (PTIME*GROUP>0.05). HbA1c concentrations significantly decreased after exercise training (PTIME<0.001), with a significant greater reduction in FedEx (-0.30±0.06%) compared to FastEx (-0.08±0.06%; mean difference 0.21%; PTIME*GROUP=0.016). No interaction effects were observed for skeletal muscle genes related to  or oxidative capacity.Endurance-type exercise training in the fasted or fed state do not differ in their efficacy to reduce  mass, increase  oxidation capacity, increase cardiorespiratory fitness and HDL concentrations or their risk of hypoglycemia in male patients with type  diabetes.

Melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), contributes to appetite control in hypothalamic neurons and is a target for future anti-obesity treatments (such as setmelanotide) or novel drug development effort. Proper MC4R trafficking regulation in hypothalamic neurons is crucial for normal neural control of homeostasis and is altered in obesity and in presence of lipids. The mechanisms underlying altered MC4R trafficking in the context of obesity is still unclear. Here, we discovered that C2CD5 expressed in the hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of MC4R endocytosis. This study unmasked a novel trafficking protein nutritionally regulated in the hypothalamus providing a novel target for MC4R dependent  involved in bodyweight homeostasis and Obesity.To evaluate the expression of C2cd5, we first used in situ hybridization and RNAscope technology in combination with electronic microscopy. For in vivo, we characterized the energy balance of wild type (WT) and C2CD5 whole-body knockout (C2CD5KO) mice fed normal chow (NC) and/or western-diet (high-fat/high-sucrose/cholesterol) (WD). To this end, we performed comprehensive longitudinal assessment of bodyweight, energy balance (food intake, energy expenditure, locomotor activity using TSE  cages), and glucose homeostasis. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of loss of C2CD5 on feeding behavior changes normally induced by MC4R agonist (Melanotan, MTII) injection in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). For in vitro approach, we tease out the role of C2CD5 and its calcium sensing domain C2 in MC4R trafficking. We focused on endocytosis of MC4R using an antibody feeding experiment (in a neuronal cell line - Neuro2A (N2A) stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP; against HA-tag and analyzed by flux cytometry).We found that 1) the expression of hypothalamic C2CD5 is decreased in diet-induced obesity models compared to controls, ) mice lacking C2CD5 exhibit an increase in food intake compared to WT mice, 3) C2CD5 interacts with endocytosis machinery in hypothalamus, 4) loss of functional C2CD5 (lacking C2 domain) blunts MC4R endocytosis in vitro and increases MC4R at the surface that fails to respond to MC4R ligand, and, 5) C2CD5KO mice exhibit decreased acute responses to MTII injection into the PVH.Based on these, we conclude that hypothalamic C2CD5 is involved in MC4R endocytosis and regulate bodyweight homeostasis. These studies suggest that C2CD5 represents a new protein regulated by  cues and involved in  receptor endocytosis. C2CD5 represent a new target and pathway that could be targeted in Obesity.Copyright © 2019.

Each LD is enclosed by a monolayer of phospholipids, distinct from bilayer membranes. During LD biogenesis and growth, this monolayer of lipids expands by acquiring phospholipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through nonvesicular mechanisms. Here, in a mini-screen, we find that ORP5, an integral membrane protein of the ER, can localize to ER-LD contact sites upon oleate loading. ORP5 interacts with LDs through its ligand-binding domain, and ORP5 deficiency enhances neutral  synthesis and increases the size of LDs. Importantly, there is significantly more phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) and less phosphatidylserine (PS) on LDs in ORP5-deficient cells than in normal cells. The increased presence of PI(4)P on LDs in ORP5-deficient cells requires phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase -α. Our results thus demonstrate the existence of PI(4)P on LDs and suggest that LD-associated PI(4)P may be primarily used by ORP5 to deliver PS to LDs.© 2019 Du et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654486>The association study of  gene polymorphisms with AMD identifies a protective role for APOE-E2 allele in the wet form in a Northern Spanish population.</a></h1><p>To elucidate the potential role of eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the most relevant  genes in Northern Spanish patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).A case-control study of 228 unrelated native Northern Spanish patients diagnosed with AMD (73 dry and 155 wet) and 95 healthy controls was performed. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genotyped for the SNPs APOE rs429358 and rs7412; CTEP rs3764261; LIPC rs10468017 and rs493258; LPL rs12678919; ABCA1 rs1883025; ABCA4 rs76157638, rs3112831 and rs1800555; and SCARB1 rs5888, using TaqMan probes.

An understanding of  in women at risk of GDM could contribute to earlier diagnosis and treatment. We tested the hypothesis that altered  at the beginning of the second trimester in obese pregnant women is associated with a diagnosis of GDM. Plasma samples from 831 participants (16-45 years, 15-18 weeks gestation, BMI ≥ 30) from the UPBEAT study of obese pregnant women were used. The , sterol and glyceride fraction was isolated and analysed in a semi-quantitative fashion using direct infusion mass spectrometry. A combination of uni-, multi-variate and multi-variable statistical analyses was used to identify candidate biomarkers in plasma associated with a diagnosis of GDM (early third trimester; IADPSG criteria). Multivariable adjusted analyses showed that participants who later developed GDM had a greater abundance of several triglycerides (48:0, 50:1, 50:, 51:5, 53:4) and phosphatidylcholine (38:5). In contrast sphingomyelins (32:1, 41:, 42:3), lyso-phosphatidylcholine (16:0, 18:1), phosphatidylcholines (35:, 40:7, 40:10), two polyunsaturated triglycerides (46:5, 48:6) and several oxidised triglycerides (48:6, 54:4, 56:4, 58:6) were less abundant.

As gut microbial imbalances and maladaptive host responses have been implicated in the pathology of obesity and diabetes, this study aimed to determine the effects of pharmacologically stimulated GLP-1 and GLP- receptor function on the gut microbiome composition in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice received treatment with a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide, 0. mg/kg, BID) or dual GLP-1/GLP- receptor agonist (GUB09-145, 0.04 mg/kg, BID) for 4 weeks. Both compounds suppressed caloric intake, promoted a marked weight loss, improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma cholesterol levels. 16S rDNA sequencing and deep-sequencing shotgun metagenomics was applied for comprehensive within-subject profiling of changes in gut microbiome signatures. Compared to baseline, DIO mice assumed phylogenetically similar gut bacterial compositional changes following liraglutide and GUB09-145 treatment, characterized by discrete shifts in low-abundant species and related bacterial  .

This trial aimed to determine the effect of dietary fibre (DB) (mix of wheat, soy and sugar beet pulp fibres) and aleurone supplementation and their interaction on energy and nitrogen balances in growing pigs with ad libitum access to feed. Forty pigs (BW: 35 kg) were fed diets differing by fibre concentration (NDF concentration: 10% or 14% DM) and aleurone supplementation (0,  or 4 g/kg) during 3 weeks. Pigs were housed individually in a respiration chamber during the last week to record feeding behaviour and measure energy and nitrogen balances (n = 36). Glucose oxidation was studied on the 6th day with an injection of [U-13C] glucose and measurement of 13CO2 production. There was no significant interaction between DB inclusion and aleurone supplementation on any variables characterizing feeding behaviour. Pigs had less but longer meals with high level of DB, with an increased interval between two meals without effect on daily feed intake. The meal frequency significantly decreased when aleurone supplementation increased. Total tract apparent digestibility coefficient of DM, organic matter, ash, nitrogen and gross energy decreased when pigs received high DB level. Dietary fibre level increased significantly faecal excreted nitrogen. Aleurone supplementation decreased nitrogen retention. Free access to the feed induced a great individual variability not only in feed intake level (from 784 to 2290 g/day) but also in feeding behaviour (from 5.5 to 21.5 meals per day). This variability can be linked with the importance of underlying feed intake regulation pathways and difference in energy balance and  efficiency. Several profiles of  efficiency can be discriminate, thanks to a clustering based on feeding behaviour and pre-prandial concentrations of metabolites and hormones. In conclusion, DB inclusion decreased meal frequency, increased average meal size, decreased total tract apparent faecal digestibility coefficient of nitrogen and gross energy. Supplementation of aleurone decreased average daily feed intake with a reduction of the meal number per day, without modification of average meal size. Aleurone supplementation decreased nitrogen retention and nutrient deposition. Independently of experimental diets, the high individual variability permitted discriminating different profiles with different metabolic strategies. Efficient pigs with a high energy retention as protein and  seem to be able to adapt their  according to energy sources.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638831>Inhibition of dengue virus infection by 1-stearoyl--arachidonoyl-phosphatidylinositol .</a></h1><p>Dengue fever is an acute febrile infectious disease caused by dengue virus (DENV). Despite the significant public health concerns posed by DENV, there are currently no effective anti-DENV therapeutic agents. To develop such drugs, a better understanding of the detailed mechanisms of DENV infection is needed. Both  and  synthesis are activated in DENV-infected cells, so we used  screening to identify potential antiviral  molecules. We identified 1-stearoyl--arachidonoyl-phosphatidylinositol (SAPI), which is the most abundant endogenous phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecular species, as an anti-DENV  molecule. SAPI suppressed the cytopathic effects induced by DENV2 infection as well as the replication of all DENV serotypes without inhibiting the entry of DENV2 into host cells. However, no other PI molecular species or PI metabolites, including lysophosphatidylinositols and phosphoinositides, displayed anti-DENV2 activity. Furthermore, SAPI suppressed the production of DENV2 infection-induced cytokines and chemokines, including C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)5, CCL20, C-X-C chemokine ligand 8, IL-6, and IFN-β. SAPI also suppressed the TNF-α production induced by LPS stimulation in macrophage cells differentiated from THP-1 cells.

The demographic data, anthropometric parameters, and laboratory results were collected from 24 512 type  diabetes patients. The BP goal was a systolic BP <130 mm Hg and a diastolic BP <80 mm Hg regardless of a history of hypertension or current antihypertensive treatment. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 59.9% with geographical differences. Among the diabetes patients with hypertension, 76.9% received antihypertensive medicines. Calcium channel blockers (39.3%), angiotensin II receptor antagonists (26.6%), and then β-blockers (14.0%) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (13.6%) were frequently used for BP control. Only 17.5% (n = 2658) of diabetes patients with hypertension reached the recommended target BP. Body mass index <24 kg/m , urban resident, frequent physical activity, good adherence to medication, comorbidity with cardiovascular disease, achieving glycemic goal (HbA1c <7.0%), achieving  goal (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <.59 mmol/L) were independent factors that predicted achievement of target BP goal. On the contrary, comorbidity with chronic kidney disease predicted failure to achieve target BP goal. Patients who were treated in a cardiology department or lived in the North were more likely to achieve BP goals. A considerable proportion of diabetic patients failed to achieve guideline-recommended BP targets.

Angiotensin converting enzyme  (ACE2) counteracts Ang II/AT1R axis via converting Ang II to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which is known to have an anti-obesity effect. In this study, we hypothesized that ACE2 exerts a strong anti-obesity effect by increasing Ang1-7 levels. We injected intraperitoneally recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) (.0mg/ kg/day) for 28 days to high- diet (HFD) induced obesity mice. rhACE2 treatment decreased body weight and improved glucose . Furthermore, rhACE2 increased oxygen consumption and upregulated thermogenesis in HFD-fed mice. In the rhACE2 treatment group, BAT mass increased, accompanied with ameliorated insulin signaling and increased protein levels of UCP-1 and PRDM16. Importantly, subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) mass decreased, concomitant with browning, which was established by the increase of UCP-1 expression. The browning is due to increased H3K27 acetylation via the downregulation of HDAC3 and increased H3K9 acetylation via upregulation of GCN5 and PCAF. These results suggest that rhACE2 exerts anti-obesity effects by stimulating BAT and inducing browning in sWAT. ACE2 and the Ang 1-7 axis represent a potential therapeutic approach to prevent the development of obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663477>In vivo antiplasmodial activity of curcumin-loaded Nanostructured  Carriers.</a></h1><p>It was shown that curcumin (Cur) has anti-plasmodium activity, however, its weak bioavailability, rapid , and limited chemical stability has restricted its application in clinical usages. Nanostructured  carriers (NLCs) are a type of drug-delivery systems (DDSs) which their core matrix is composed of both solid and liquid lipids.The aim of the current study was to prepare and characterize curcumin-loaded nanostructured  carriers (Cur-NLC) for malaria treatment.For the production of NLC, coconut oil and cetyl palmitate were selected as a liquid and solid , respectively. In order to prepare the Cur-NLC, the microemulsion method was applied. General toxicity assay on Artemia salina and also hemocompatibility was investigated. Antimalarial activity was studied on mice infected with Plasmodium berghei.The NLCs mean particle size and polydispersity index (PI) was 145 nm and 0.3, respectively. Moreover, the zeta potential of the Cur-NLC was -25 mV, as well as, the NLCs showed pseudo-spherical shape which revealed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The loading capacity and encapsulation efficacy of the obtained Cur-NLC were 3.1 ± 0.015% and 74 ± 3.32%, respectively. In vitro, Cur release profiles showed a sustained-release pattern up to 5 days in synthesized Cur-NLC. The results of in vivo anti-plasmodial activity against P. berghei revealed that antimalarial activity of Cur-NLC was high -fold compared with bare Cur at the tested dosage level.The results of this study showed that NLC would be used as a potential nanocarrier for the treatment of malaria.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642491>Altered Expression of Adrenomedullin  and its Receptor in the Adipose Tissue of Obese Patients.</a></h1><p>Adrenomedullin  (AM2) plays protective roles in the renal and cardiovascular systems. Recently, studies on experimental animals showed that AM2 is an adipokine with beneficial effects on energy . However, there is little information regarding AM2 expression in human adipose tissue.To investigate the pattern and regulation of AM2 expression and that of its receptor component in human adipose tissue, in the context of obesity and type  diabetes.We measured metabolic parameters, serum AM2 and expression of ADM2 and its receptor component genes in abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue in obese (with or without type  diabetes) and normal-weight women. Serum AM2 was assessed before and 6-9 months after bariatric surgery. Expression/secretion of AM2 and its receptor was assessed in human adipocytes.ADM2 mRNA in both  depots was higher in obese patients, whether diabetic or not. Although serum AM2 was significantly lower in obese patients, it was not changed after bariatric surgery. AM2 and its receptor complex were predominantly expressed by adipocytes, and expression of CALCRL, encoding a component of the AM2 receptor complex, was lower in both  depots of obese patients. Incubating adipocytes with substances mimicking the microenvironment of obese adipose tissue increased ADM2 mRNA but reduced AM2 secretion into culture media and CALCRL mRNA expression.Our data indicate that AM2 signalling is suppressed in adipose tissue in obesity, involving lower receptor expression and ligand availability, likely contributing to insulin resistance and other aspects of the pathophysiology associated with obesity.© Endocrine Society 2019.

To better understand the effects of whole diets on stress system responsiveness, we examined randomized control trial effects of a whole food diet based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) on cortisol responsiveness. A randomized, double-blind, controlled 8-week intervention was conducted in overweight and obese women to examine differentiated effects between two diet intervention groups: one based on the 2010 DGA and the other one based on a typical American diet (TAD). During a test week that occurred at baseline and again after 8 weeks of the intervention, we assessed salivary cortisol collected at 14 selected times across the day, including upon awakening, at bedtime, and during a test visit, and administered a standardized social stress task (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). There were no statistical differences between the diet groups in salivary cortisol at baseline or after 8 weeks. However, when considering differences in dietary carbohydrate, but not  or protein, from the pre-intervention (habitual) to the intervention period, there was a significant ( = 0.0001) interaction between diet group, intervention week, saliva sample, and level of intervention-based change in carbohydrate consumption. This interaction was reflected primarily by an 8-week reduction in salivary cortisol during a period just prior to (log Δ -0.35 ± 0.12 nmol/L) and 30 (log Δ -0.49 ± 0.12 nmol/L), 60 (log Δ -0.50 ± 0.13 nmol/L), 90 (log Δ -0.51 ± 0.13 nmol/L), and 120 (log Δ -0.4476 ± 0.1231 nmol/L) min after the TSST in the DGA group having the highest increase (90th percentile) in carbohydrate consumption. In support of this finding, we also found significant ( < 0.05) and inverse linear associations between dietary carbohydrate and log salivary cortisol, with the strongest negative association (β: -0.004 ± 0.0015,  = 0.009) occurring at 30 min post-TSST, but only in the DGA group and at week 9 of the intervention. Together, increasing dietary carbohydrate as part of a DGA-based diet may reduce circulating cortisol and dampen psychological stress-related cortisol responsiveness.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672618>Oxysterols and sterols: from lipidomics to food sciences.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678484>Dietary soybean oil, canola oil and partially-hydrogenated soybean oil affect testicular tissue and steroid hormone levels differently in the miniature pig.</a></h1><p>The present study was conducted to examine the influence of dietary canola oil (CAN) and partially-hydrogenated soybean oil (HSO) compared to soybean oil (SOY, control) on the morphology and function of testes using miniature pigs as the test subject. Male miniature pigs were fed a diet containing 10%SOY, 9%CAN+1%SOY, or 9%HSO+1%SOY for 18 months. The scheduled autopsies revealed no abnormalities in histopathological examination of the major organs, except the testes. Atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and hyperplasia in the Leydig cells were found in the SOY and CAN groups. DNA microarray analysis indicated downregulation in the CAN and the HSO groups of genes encoding for gonadotropins in the pituitary gland and of enzymes and proteins involved in steroid hormone  in the testes, compared to the SOY group. Plasma levels of sex hormones in the CAN and HSO groups tended to be higher and testosterone and dihydrotestosteorne in the HSO group were significantly higher than in the SOY group. These results demonstrate that testes are morphologically and functionally affected by the dietary oils, while the plasma steroid hormone levels do not necessarily reflect the gene expression, probably owing to feedback regulation via the gonadal hormones in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis.Copyright © 2019.

However, studies have failed to control for habitual physical activity levels, which directly influences both mtDNA copy number and insulin sensitivity. We, therefore, examined whether physical conditioning status (maximal oxygen uptake, V̇O) was associated with skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume and mtDNA, and was predictive of T2DM in overweight, middle-aged men.Whole-body physiological (ISI-insulin sensitivity index, HOMA-IR, V̇O) and muscle biochemical/molecular (vastus lateralis; mtDNA, mitochondrial and glycolytic enzymes activity,  content and markers of  peroxidation) measurements were performed in three groups of overweight, middle-aged male volunteers (n = 10 per group): sedentary T2DM (ST2DM); sedentary control (SC) and non-sedentary control (NSC), who differed in aerobic capacity (ST2DM < SC < NSC).mtDNA was greater in NSC versus SC and ST2DM (P < 0.001; P < 0.001), and less in ST2DM versus SC (P < 0.01). Across all groups, mtDNA positively correlated with ISI (P < 0.001; r = 0.688) and V̇O (normalised to free  mass; r = 0.684, P < 0.001), and negatively correlated to HOMA-IR (r = -0.544, P < 0.01). The activity of mitochondrial enzymes (GluDH, CS and β-HAD) was greater in NSC than ST2DM (P < 0.01, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05) and SC (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), but similar between ST2DM and SC. Intramuscular-free fatty acids, triglycerides and malondialdehyde contents were similar between ST2DM and SC.Body composition and indices of muscle mitochondrial volume/function were similar between SC and ST2DM. However, mtDNA differed and was positively associated with ISI, HOMA-IR and V̇O across all groups. Collectively, the findings support the contention that habitual physical activity is a key component of T2DM development, possibly by influencing mtDNA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652245>Exercise Effects on Mitochondrial Function and  during Energy Balance.</a></h1><p>Aerobic exercise training (AET) has been shown to improve mitochondrial bioenergetics and upregulate proteins related to . However, it remains to be determined if these alterations associated with AET persist when measured in energy balance (EB) in the days following the last bout of training. . The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that improvements in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function induced by AET observed in previous literature would persist when measured after restoring EB conditions 72 hours removed from the last exercise bout.Participants were 14 premenopausal women (age = 31. ± 6.7 years, BMI = 26.6 ± 5.1 kg/m). The AET program required 3 monitored training sessions per week for 8-16 weeks. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and following 8-16 weeks of AET (≥72 hrs after the last exercise bout). All food was provided for 72 hours prior to biopsies and EB was managed 24 hours prior to testing within ±100 kcal of measured energy requirements using a whole-room calorimeter. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity was quantified in permeabilized muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis.We found that AET increased coupled respiration (154%) and uncoupled respiration (90%) rates using a fatty acid substrate (palmitoyl carnitine) (P<0.05). However, when rates were normalized to complex IV activity (a marker of mitochondrial content), no significant differences were observed. Additionally, there were no changes in proteins known to mediate mitochondrial biogenesis or  transport and  following AET.8-16 weeks of AET improved mitochondrial capacity under fatty acid substrate when assessed in EB, which appears to be due to mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640132>Effects of Dietary Supplementation of Alpha-Ketoglutarate in a Low-Protein Diet on Fatty Acid Composition and  Related Gene Expression in Muscles of Growing Pigs.</a></h1><p>The aim of the current study was to investigate whether dietary supplementation with alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) in a reduced crude protein (CP) diet would affect fatty acid composition and  related gene expression in the muscles of growing pigs. A total of 27 Large White × Landrace growing pigs at 44 ± 1 d of age (11.96 ± 0.18 kg) were randomly allocated to three treatments ( = 9). Dietary treatments included: (1) normal protein diet with 20% crude protein (CP) (NP); () a low crude protein diet formulated to contain approximately 17% CP (LP); and (3) a low crude protein diet with 17% CP supplemented with 1% AKG at the expense of regular corn components (ALP). The experimental trial lasted 35 d. The results showed that compared with the NP and LP diets, supplementation with AKG in a low-protein diet increased the intramuscular  (IMF), oleic acid (C18:1n-9), and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) contents ( < 0.05), and tended to increase the percentage of palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and stearic acid (C18:0) ( < 0.10) in the biceps femoris and longissimus dorsi muscles of growing pigs. These effects may be associated with increased relative mRNA expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD1), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in skeletal muscle, indicating that AKG might be involved in the differential regulation of some key lipogenic genes in skeletal muscles of pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676443>Increased fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation in liver are associated with increased plasma kynurenine metabolites and nicotinamide levels in normolipidemic and carnitine-depleted rats.</a></h1><p>Dysregulation of the tryptophan (Trp)-NAD pathway has been related to several pathological conditions, and the metabolites in this pathway are known to influence mitochondrial respiration and redox status. The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound -(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic acid, Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects on body composition.To compare the long-term effects of weight loss via severe vs moderate energy restriction on lean mass and other aspects of body composition.The Type of Energy Manipulation for Promoting Optimum Metabolic Health and Body Composition in Obesity (TEMPO) Diet Trial was a 12-month, single-center, randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least 5 years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%) energy restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%) energy restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate energy restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual body weight per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole-body lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were body weight, thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and  mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.] years; mean [SD] weight, 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.4 [.5]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more weight (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8. to -5.1 kg), lost more whole-body lean mass (effect size, -1. kg; 95% CI, -.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4. cm2; 95% CI, -6.5 to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total weight loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole-body  mass (effect size, -5.5 kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe energy restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole-body lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate energy restriction and was associated with -fold greater weight and  loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate energy restriction.

Furthermore, we performed QTL analysis and Mendelian randomization analysis to obtain additional evidence to be associated with the identified phosSNPs and genes.We found 483 phosSNPs for  levels and 243 phosSNPs for RA in the GWAS loci (P < 1.0 × 10-5). SNPs associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Total cholesterol (TC) and RA were significantly enriched with phosSNPs. Almost all of the identified phosSNPs showed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) effects. A total of 48 protein QTLs and 9 metabolite QTLs were found. The phosSNP rs3184504 (p.Trp262Arg) at SH2B3 was significantly associated with RA, SH2B3 expression level, and plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TC, hypoxanthine and 80 proteins, including beta--microglobulin. SH2B3 was differentially expressed between RA cases and controls in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and synovial tissues. Mendelian randomization analysis showed that SH2B3 expression level was significantly associated with TC level and RA. Plasma beta--microglobulin level was causally associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TC levels and RA.The findings suggested that phosSNPs may play important roles in  and the pathological mechanisms of RA. PhosSNPs may influence  levels and RA risk by altering gene expression and plasma protein levels.© The Author(s) 2019.

Current guidelines recommend continuous energy restriction (CER) along with a comprehensive lifestyle intervention as the cornerstone of obesity treatment, yet this approach produces modest weight loss on average. Recently, there has been increased interest in identifying alternative dietary weight loss strategies that involve restricting energy intake to certain periods of the day or prolonging the fasting interval between meals (i.e., intermittent energy restriction, IER). These strategies include intermittent fasting (IMF; >60% energy restriction on -3 days per week, or on alternate days) and time-restricted feeding (TRF; limiting the daily period of food intake to 8-10 h or less on most days of the week). Here, we summarize the current evidence for IER regimens as treatments for overweight and obesity. Specifically, we review randomized trials of ≥8 weeks in duration performed in adults with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m) in which an IER paradigm (IMF or TRF) was compared to CER, with the primary outcome being weight loss.

Demographic characteristics, body composition, hand grip, gait speed, and indices of glucose and  were collected. Sarcopenia and SO were diagnosed using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria.(1) The prevalence of sarcopenia was 19.% in males and 8.6% in females. The prevalence of SO was 7.0% in males and .4% in females. () In males, the odds ratios (ORs) of osteoporosis and dyslipidemia in the SO group were 4.21-fold and 4.15-fold higher than those in the normal group, respectively. In females, the ORs of osteoporosis and hyperglycemia in the SO group were 1.12-fold and 4.21-fold higher than those in the normal group.Males were more likely to be sarcopenic and to have SO than females using the AWGS criteria. Females with SO were more likely to have higher blood glucose, whereas males with SO were more likely to have osteoporosis and dyslipidemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678069>Ingestion of lean meat elevates muscle inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 protein content independent of a distinct post-prandial circulating proteome in young adults with obesity.</a></h1><p>We have recently shown that a novel signalling kinase, inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1), is implicated in whole-body insulin resistance via its inhibitory action on Akt. Insulin and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) share many intracellular processes with both known to play a key role in glucose and protein  in skeletal muscle.We aimed to compare IGF/IP6K1/Akt signalling and the plasma proteomic signature in individuals with a range of BMIs after ingestion of lean meat.Ten lean [Body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m): 22.7 ± 0.4; Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA): 1.36 ± 0.17], 10 overweight (BMI: 27.1 ± 0.5; HOMA: 1.25 ± 0.11), and 10 obese (BMI: 35.9 ± 1.3; HOMA: 5.82 ± 0.81) adults received primed continuous L-[ring-C]phenylalanine infusions. Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected at 0 min (post-absorptive), 120 min and 300 min relative to the ingestion of 170 g pork loin (36 g protein and 5 g ) to examine skeletal muscle protein signalling, plasma proteomic signatures, and whole-body phenylalanine disappearance rates (R).Phenylalanine R was not different in obese compared to lean individuals at all time points and was not responsive to a pork ingestion (basal, P = .056; 120 & 300 min, P > .05). IP6K1 was elevated in obese individuals at 120 min post-prandial vs basal (P < .05). There were no acute differences plasma proteomic profiles between groups in the post-prandial state (P > .05).These data demonstrate, for the first time that muscle IP6K1 protein content is elevated after lean meat ingestion in obese adults, suggesting that IP6K1 may be contributing to the dysregulation of nutrient uptake in skeletal muscle. In addition, proteomic analysis showed no differences in proteomic signatures between obese, overweight or lean individuals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Under excess energy conditions, TG is synthesized by acylation of diacylglycerol (DG), whereas TG is broken down into DG and free fatty acid, which provide energy for mitochondrial  oxidation when needed. In this regard, DG is not merely an intermediate metabolite for TG ; it also serves as a signaling molecule. DG kinase (DGK) phosphorylates DG to produce phosphatidic acid (PA). Consequently, DGK plays a pivotal role in the control of  and signal transduction pathway. Recently, a report has described that DGKε-knockout (KO) mice show expansion of epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) together with the impairment of glucose clearance after short-term (40 days) high  diet (HFD) feeding, an early presymptomatic phase of obesity in wild-type animals. Nevertheless, no report describes an investigation of their phenotype under long-term HFD feeding conditions. Remarkably, results obtained during long-term HFD feeding show that WAT mass is decreased significantly and that the blood glucose profile in response to glucose challenge is improved in DGKε-KO mice compared with wild-type, which contrast sharply against the phenotype shown for short-term HFD feeding. Morphological examination reveals that cyclooxygenase- (COX-) expression and clusters of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-positive multilocular brown-like ("beige") adipocyte are induced in DGKε-deficient WAT after long-term HFD feeding, suggesting that beige adipocytes facilitate energy expenditure during prolonged HFD feeding. Administration of celecoxib, a selective inhibitor of COX-, abolishes the appearance of UCP1-positive beige adipocytes in DGKε-KO mice. These findings suggest that DGKε deficiency promotes visceral WAT remodeling in a COX--dependent manner under long-term HFD feeding conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we aimed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of an IFD to reduce body mass index and glucose  in the general population without diabetes mellitus. Cochrane, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared an IFD with a regular diet or a continuous calorie restriction diet. The effectiveness of an IFD was estimated by the weighted mean difference (WMD) for several variables associated with glucometabolic parameters including body mass index (BMI) and fasting glucose. The pooled mean differences of outcomes were calculated using a random effects model. From 2814 studies identified through a literature search, we finally selected 12 articles (545 participants). Compared with a control diet, an IFD was associated with a significant decline in BMI (WMD, -0.75 kg/m; 95% CI, -1.44 to -0.06), fasting glucose level (WMD, -4.16 mg/dL; 95% CI, -6.92 to -1.40), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (WMD, -0.54; 95% CI, -1.05 to -0.03).  mass (WMD, -0.98 kg; 95% CI, -.32 to 0.36) tended to decrease in the IFD group with a significant increase in adiponectin (WMD, 1008.9 ng/mL; 95% CI, 140.5 to 1877.3) and a decrease in leptin (WMD, -0.51 ng/mL; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.24) levels.

In this study, we compared the difference in prevalence of elevated and hypertensive BP values defined by the 2017 AAP guideline and the 2004 Fourth Report and estimated the cardiovascular risk associated with the reclassification of BP status defined by the AAP guideline. A total of 47 200 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years from 6 countries (China, India, Iran, Korea, Poland, and Tunisia) were included in this study. Elevated BP and hypertension were defined according to  guidelines. In addition, 1606 children from China, Iran, and Korea who were reclassified upward by the AAP guideline compared with the Fourth Report and for whom laboratory data were available were 1:1 matched with children from the same countries who were normotensive by both guidelines. Compared with the Fourth Report, the prevalence of elevated BP defined by the AAP guideline was lower (14.9% versus 8.6%), whereas the prevalence of stages 1 and  hypertension was higher (stage 1, 6.6% versus 14.5%; stage , 0.4% versus 1.7%). Additionally, comparison of laboratory data in the case-control study showed that children who were reclassified upward were more likely to have adverse  profiles and high fasting blood glucose compared with normotensive children. In conclusion, the prevalence of elevated BP and hypertension varied significantly between both guidelines.

Di-(-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), a widely used plasticizer, could exacerbate type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study aimed to investigate the metabolic toxicity, susceptibility and mechanism of DEHP exposure to A-T2DM. DEHP was administered orally (0, 0.18, 1.8, 18, and 180 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks to adolescent normal mice (A-normal mice) and established A-T2DM mice. The results of fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels showed that the susceptibility of A-T2DM mice to DEHP exposure was more significant than that of A-normal mice. DEHP, interfering with glucose and  of A-normal and A-T2DM mice, caused the body weight increase of A-normal mice and decrease of A-T2DM mice. Besides, DEHP could cause more injury of cardiovascular, hepatic and renal function to A-T2DM mice than A-normal mice. Hepatic transcriptome analysis revealed that DEHP exposure interfered with the biological feedback adjustment of endocrine and metabolic system in A-T2DM mice and then led to the development of T2DM. According to the transcriptome results, insulin signaling transduction pathway was applied and researched by immunoassay. It was discovered that DEHP reduced insulin sensitivity and disturbed insulin signaling transduction, glucose utilization,  synthesis and protein synthesis. Collectively, DEHP could disturb the endocrine and metabolic functions and increase the insulin resistance in adolescent mice. Moreover, the adolescent T2DM mice are more sensitive to DEHP-induced endocrine and metabolic toxicity than the healthy adolescent mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627187>RabGAPs TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 in skeletal muscle function and exercise.</a></h1><p>The two closely related RabGAPs TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 are key signaling factors of skeletal muscle substrate utilization. In mice, deficiency in both RabGAPs leads to reduced skeletal muscle glucose transport in response to insulin and lower GLUT4 abundance. Conversely, Tbc1d1- and Tbc1d4-deficiency results in enhanced  use as fuel in skeletal muscle, through yet unknown mechanisms. In humans, variants in TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 are linked to obesity and insulin resistance and type  diabetes. While the specific function in  of each of the two RabGAPs remains to be determined, TBC1D1 emerges to be controlling exercise endurance and physical capacity whereas TBC1D4 may rather be responsible for maintaining muscle insulin sensitivity, muscle contraction, and exercise. There is growing evidence that TBC1D1 also plays an important role in skeletal muscle development, since it has been found to be associated to meat production traits in several livestock species. In addition, TBC1D1 protein abundance in skeletal muscle is regulated by both, insulin receptor and insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor signaling. This review focusses on the specific roles of the two key signaling factors TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 in skeletal muscle , development and exercise physiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601342>[Effects of wheat bran fiber on  in ApoE~(-/-) mice].</a></h1><p>To explore the effect and mechanism of wheat bran fiber on  in ApoE~(-/-)mice fed a high  diet.Twenty 7-week-old male ApoE~(-/-)mice were randomly divided into two groups and fed either a high  diet as AS model group or a high  diet adding 0. 8% wheat bran fiber as W-fiber group.

The associations between the SVR and T2DM and MS were examined using logistic regression to determine whether the SVR was associated with T2DM and MS. profiles, glucose levels, blood pressure, WC and BMI showed significant differences when stratified based on the extent of SVR. The SVR levels were also significantly higher in subjects without MS or T2DM than in those with MS or T2DM. The SVR was inversely correlated with  profiles and WC and was especially correlated with BMI, with an r>0.5. The SVR was identified as a risk factor for T2DM and MS after adjusting age and sex. SVR can predict T2DM [area under the curve =0.726, 95% CI (0.669-0.782), <0.001] and MS [area under the curve =0.730, 95% CI (0.694-0.766), <0.001].

Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increase the risk of type  diabetes (T2D). This study investigated CETP gene variants to assess the risk of T2D and specific complications of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and diabetic retinopathy. Towards this, a total of 3023 Taiwanese individuals (1383 without T2D, 1640 with T2D) were enrolled in this study. T2D mice (+Lepr/+Lepr, db/db) were used to determine CETP expression in tissues. The A-alleles of rs3764261, rs4783961, and rs1800775 variants were found to be independently associated with .86, 1.71, and 0.91 mg/dL increase in HDL-C per allele, respectively. In addition, the A-allele of rs4783961 was significantly associated with a reduced T2D risk (odds ratio (OR), 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71‒0.96)), and the A-allele of rs1800775 was significantly related to a lowered DKD risk (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64‒0.96).

We aimed to investigate the independent contribution of visceral adipose measured by visceral adiposity index and  accumulation product and liver  assessed by fatty liver index to the risk of hyperuricemia.We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 1284 participants aged ≥ 40 years old recruited from communities in Zhonglou district, Changzhou. Each participant completed a standard questionnaire, and provided blood samples for biochemical measurements. Visceral adiposity index, fatty liver index and  accumulation product were calculated by simple anthropometric and functional parameters. Hyperuricemia was defined as serum uric acid ≥ 420 μmol/l for males and ≥ 360 μmol/l for females.The prevalence of hyperuricemia was 15.9% and gradually increased across tertiles of adiposity-based indices. The visceral adipose-based measurements (visceral adiposity index, fatty liver index,  accumulation product) had better power to discriminate hyperuricemia than body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and neck circumference, and visceral adiposity index exhibited the highest power, with the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.662 (0.636-0.688). Multivariate logistic regression found 1.49-fold, .21-fold and .12-fold increased risk of hyperuricemia with 1-unit increment of visceral adiposity index, fatty liver index, and  accumulation product, respectively. Compared to tertile 1, the odds ratios of hyperuricemia for the second tertile and the third tertile of visceral adiposity index were 1.57 (1.00-.50) and 3.11 (1.96-4.94), those of fatty liver index were 1.64 (1.05-.68) and 3.58 (1.94-6.01), and those of  accumulation product were 1.93 (1.19-3.15) and 3.53 (.05-6.09), respectively. However, no significant associations of BMI, waist circumference and neck circumference with hyperuricemia were observed.Visceral adipose accumulation increased the risk of hyperuricemia, independently of BMI, waist circumference and neck circumference, among middle-aged and elderly Chinese adults.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607479>Effects of maternal dietary supplementation of phytosterol esters during gestation on muscle development of offspring in mice.</a></h1><p>The development of muscle in the embryo, which is crucial for postnatal skeletal muscle growth, has been investigated widely. Much has been learned during the past several decades about the role of maternal nutrition in the outcome of pregnancy. Protein and carbohydrate levels during pregnancy have been shown to be important in the development of offspring, especially muscle development. However, the maternal effects of steroids were still not clear. Phytosterol esters (PEs) are produced by the esterification of phytosterols and fatty acids and have many beneficial functions, such as anti-inflammation and hypolipemic functions. Through the effect of regulation on , can pregnant mice fed with PEs show any programming effect on the muscle development of offspring? In our study, PEs were supplied to the maternal diet, and changes in maternal  and the development of offspring skeletal muscle were detected. As a result, the amniotic fluid total bile acid (TBA) and total cholesterol (TC) levels were decreased; the growth of offspring was significantly faster than that of the control group until 6 weeks of age. Adult offspring had a higher lean mass index and grip strength. In skeletal muscle, the proportion of myosin heavy chain (MHC) 1 was significantly decreased, while the proportion of MHC  b was increased. In conclusion, maternal PEs significantly reduced sterols in the amniotic fluid, while skeletal muscle development was promoted in the offspring.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A face-centered central composite design was adopted to observe the effects of different formulation variables on TBN-BLS, and artificial neural network (ANN) modeling was employed to optimize TBN-BLS. TBN-BLS were prepared by a thin film hydration method integrating soybean phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol as a  phase and sodium deoxycholate (SDC) as a surfactant with or without the coating of chitosan (CTS). After being subjected to physicochemical characterization, TBN-BLS were enrolled in a histopathological study and pharmacokinetic investigation in a rat model. The optimized TBN chitosan-coated bilosomes (TBN-CTS-BLS) were spherical vesicles (245.13 ± 10.23 nm) with adequate entrapment efficiency (65.25 ± 5.51%) and good permeation characteristics (340.11 ± 22.34 μg/cm). The TBN-CTS-BLS gel formulation was well-tolerated with no inflammatory signs manifested upon histopathological evaluation. The pharmacokinetic study revealed that the optimized TBN-CTS-BLS formulation successively enhanced the bioavailability of TBN by about .33-fold and increased t to about 6.21 ± 0.24 h as compared to the oral solution.

Individual data from 1,780 mice from 43 inbred strains was also used to estimate genetic variances and covariances for dispersion in each trait.Several loci for PDpLep were detected, including possibly syntenic Chr 17 loci, but there was only a single position on Chr 6 for PDAFP. Coding SNP in genes linked to the consensus Chr 17 PDpLep locus occurred in immunological and cancer genes, genes linked to diabetes and energy regulation, post-transcriptional processors and vomeronasal variants. There was evidence of intersexual differences in the genetic architecture of PDpLep. PDpLep had moderate heritability [Formula: see text] and PDAFP low heritability [Formula: see text]; dispersion in these traits was highly genetically correlated r = 0.8).Greater genetic variance for dispersion in plasma leptin, a physiological trait, may reflect its more ephemeral nature compared to body , an accrued progressive character. Genetic effects on incidental phenotypes such as leptin might be effectively characterized with randomization-detection methodologies in addition to classical approaches, helping identify incipient or borderline cases or providing new therapeutic targets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680138></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672147>Luseogliflozin attenuates neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in high- diet-fed mice via inhibition of perivascular adipose tissue remodeling.</a></h1><p>Excess  deposition could induce phenotypic changes of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT remodeling), which may promote the progression of atherosclerosis via modulation of adipocytokine secretion. However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter  (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice.Wilt-type mice fed with low- diet (LFD) or high- diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25 days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed.In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf-b in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio.Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF-B expression in PVAT. Inhibition of PVAT remodeling by luseogliflozin may be a novel therapeutic target for vascular remodeling after angioplasty.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621523>Improving HbA with Glucose Self-Monitoring in Diabetic Patients with EpxDiabetes, a Phone Call and Text Message-Based Telemedicine Platform: A Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h1><p>   n    </p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619724>Circulating Apolipoprotein L1 is associated with insulin resistance-induced abnormal .</a></h1><p>Circulating ApolipoproteinL1 (ApoL1) is a component of pre-β-high-density lipoprotein (HDL), however little is known about the relationship of ApoL1 with cardiometabolic factors.

The current study examined their associations in 126 non-diabetic subjects and 36 patients with type  diabetes (T2DM). Non-diabetic subjects demonstrated triglyceride (standardized coefficients [s.c.] = 0.204, p < 0.05), body mass index (s.c. =0.232, p < 0.05) and HDL cholesterol (s.c. = -0.203, p < 0.05) as independent determinant of ApoL1 levels, and the significant elevation of ApoL1 in metabolic syndrome. Lipoprotein fractionation analysis revealed the predominant distribution of ApoL1 in large HDL fraction, and the significant increase of ApoL1 in large LDL fraction in high ApoL1 samples with insulin resistance. In T2DM, ApoL1 was higher in T2DM with metabolic syndrome, however ApoL1 was lower with β cell dysfunction. Insulin significantly promotes ApoL1 synthesis and secretion in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, circulating ApoL1 may be associated with abnormal HDL  in insulin resistant status. This may suggest a regulation of insulin signal on the ApoL1 level, leading to offer a novel insight to the ApoL1 biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves  and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of  in obese patients with no overt type  diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type  diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without diabetes.

Hepatic function can dramatically influence whole body energy expenditure and may therefore significantly influence whole body health during cancer progression.To examine alterations in markers of hepatic  and physiology during cachexia progression.Male C57BL/6J mice were injected with 1X106 Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells dissolved in 100 µL PBS and cancer was allowed to develop for 1, , 3, or 4 weeks. Control animals were injected with an equal volume of PBS. Livers were analyzed for measures of , collagen deposition, protein turnover and mitochondrial quality.4wk animals had ~30% larger livers compared to all other groups. Cancer progression was associated with altered regulators of . Additionally, longer duration of cancer development was associated with ~3-fold increased regulators of collagen deposition as well as phenotypic collagen content, suggesting increased liver fibrosis. Mitochondrial quality control regulators appeared to be altered before any phenotypic alterations to collagen deposition. While induction of Akt was noted, downstream markers of protein synthesis were not altered.Cancer cachexia progression is associated with hepatic pathologies, specifically liver fibrosis. Alterations to mitochondrial quality control mechanisms appear to precede this fibrotic phenotype, potentially suggesting mitochondrial mechanisms for the development of hepatic pathologies during the development and progression of cancer cachexia. Novelty Cachexia progression results in liver collagen deposition and fibrosis. Alterations in mitochondrial quality control may precede liver pathologies during cachexia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652719>Peroxiredoxin 6 Down-Regulation Induces Metabolic Remodeling and Cell Cycle Arrest in HepG2 Cells.</a></h1><p>Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is the only member of 1-Cys subfamily of peroxiredoxins in human cells. It is the only Prdx acting on phospholipid hydroperoxides possessing two additional sites with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and lysophosphatidylcholine-acyl transferase (LPCAT) activities. There are contrasting reports on the roles and mechanisms of multifunctional Prdx6 in several pathologies and on its sensitivity to, and influence on, the redox environment. We have down-regulated Prdx6 with specific siRNA in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells to study its role in cell proliferation, redox homeostasis, and metabolic programming. Cell proliferation and cell number decreased while cell volume increased; import of glucose and nucleotide biosynthesis also diminished while polyamines, phospholipids, and most glycolipids increased. A proteomic quantitative analysis suggested changes in membrane arrangement and vesicle trafficking as well as redox changes in enzymes of carbon and glutathione , pentose-phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, fatty acid , biosynthesis of aminoacids, and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis. Specific redox changes in Hexokinase- (HK2), Prdx6, intracellular chloride ion channel-1 (CLIC1), PEP-carboxykinase- (PCK2), and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) are compatible with the metabolic remodeling toward a predominant gluconeogenic flow from aminoacids with diversion at 3-phospohglycerate toward serine and other biosynthetic pathways thereon and with cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657926>Digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-enriched phosphoethanolamine plasmalogens based on gastrointestinal functions in healthy mice.</a></h1><p>EPA-enriched phosphoethanolamine plasmalogens (EPA-pPE), widely present in marine creatures, is a unique glycerophospholipid with EPA at the sn- position of glycerol backbone. EPA-pPE has been reported to exhibit numerous distinctive bioactivities. However, the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE in vivo are not clear, which restrict the molecular mechanism analysis related to its distinctive activities. The aim of the present study was to illustrate the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE by  analysis in serum, intestinal wall and content after oral administration of EPA-pPE emulsion. Results showed the EPA percentage of total fatty acids in serum was increasing over time, with two peaks at 5 and 10 h by 1.89±0. and .58±0.27, respectively, then fell from 1.89±0.17 at 10h to 1.35±0.16 at16h. In small intestinal content, EPA-pPE was hydrolyzed to lyso-phospholipids and EPA by phospholipases A2, the vinyl ether bond was retained at the sn-1 position. The released EPA could be quickly taken up into the enterocytes and enter circulation. The comparison of simulated digestion in vitro showed that the distinct digestion and absorption process of EPA-pPE was a unique phenomenon. EPA could be retained in serum at high level for a substantial period of time, which suggested us that EPA-pPE was not just a short-lived circulating molecular.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608013>Sex-Based Differences in Diabetes Prevalence and Risk Factors: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study Among Low-Income Adults in China.</a></h1><p> The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) among adults has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, including China. In China, sex-based differences in the prevalence and risk factors of DM may exist, particularly among low-income individuals. Thus, we assessed these differences in the prevalence of DM and its risk factors in a low-income Chinese population.  Residents aged ≥45 years without histories of strokes or cardiovascular disease were recruited for this study. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association of risk factors with DM prevalence.  This study included 3,725 participants (41.%, men; 58.8%, women). The mean age of the women (61.12 years) was higher than that of the men (59.14 years,  < 0.001). There was no significant sex-based difference in DM prevalence (men, 14.1%; women, 14.5%). Overweight, obesity, high triglyceride levels, and hypertension were independent risk factors for DM in both sexes. However, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were negatively associated with DM risk among men [odds ratio (OR), 0.544; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.355-0.833;  = 0.005]. Among women, advanced age and high low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were independent risk factors for DM; there was a higher DM risk for women aged 55-74 years than for those aged 45-54 years; however, physical activity was associated with an increased risk of DM (OR, 1.705; 95% CI, 1.195-.432;  = 0.003).  These findings suggest a crucial need to implement individualized blood pressure, weight, and  managements in low-income populations in China to reduce the burden of DM, especially among older women.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Ni, Yu, Wu, Li, Liu, Tu, Ning, He and Wang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642867>Association of Lipidomic Profiles With Progression of Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis in HIV Infection.</a></h1><p> disruption and excess risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been observed in HIV-infected individuals, but the associations among HIV infection, plasma lipidome, and CVD risk have not been well understood.To evaluate plasma lipidomic profiles and their associations with carotid artery atherosclerosis in individuals with HIV and individuals without HIV.Prospective analysis in the Women's Interagency HIV Study and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study during a 7-year follow-up (from 2004-2006 to 2011-2013) at multicenter HIV cohorts in the United States. The study included 737 participants aged 35 to 55 years (520 with HIV and 217 without HIV) without CVD or carotid artery plaque at baseline. Data were analyzed between April 2017 and July 2019.Two hundred eleven plasma  species.Poisson regression was used to examine the associations of baseline  species with risk of plaque measured by repeated B-mode carotid artery ultrasonography imaging.Of the 737 included participants, 398 (54%) were women, 351 (48%) were African American (non-Hispanic), 156 of 737 (21%) were nonwhite Hispanic, and the mean (SD) age was 45 (6) years. After adjusting for demographic and behavioral factors, we identified 12  species, representing independent signals for 10  classes, associated with risk of plaque. Nine  species remained significant after further adjusting for conventional CVD risk factors, although many of them showed moderate to high association with conventional blood lipids (eg, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols and triglycerides). Cholesteryl ester (16:1) (risk ratio [RR] per standard deviation, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.08-1.52), ceramide (16:0) (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.02-1.63), lysophosphatidylcholine (20:4) (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.58), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (16:0) (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.57), phosphatidylethanolamine (38:6) (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.08-1.64), phosphatidylethanolamine-plasmalogen (36:) (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.04-1.52), phosphatidylserine-plasmalogen (36:3) (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.43), and triacylglycerol (54:6) (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.54) were associated with increased risk of plaque, while phosphatidylcholine (36:4) (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54-0.77) was associated with decreased risk of plaque. Most of these plaque-increased  species showed higher levels in individuals with HIV, particularly among individuals with HIV using antiretroviral therapy compared with individuals without HIV. Network analysis identified 9  modules, and  modules composed of triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines with long and unsaturated acyl chains, respectively, showed the strongest associations with increased risk of plaque.This study identified multiple plasma  species associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis, and alterations in these  species might be associated with HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy. Our data suggest unfavorable associations of long-chain and unsaturated triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines with carotid artery plaque formation.</p></html>
