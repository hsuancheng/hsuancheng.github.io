Previous studies have shown that P-glycoprotein transport activity in rat brain capillaries is rapidly reduced by the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) acting through protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent signaling. In this study, we used isolated rat brain capillaries to show that the TNF-alpha-induced reduction of P-glycoprotein activity was prevented by a PKCbeta(I/II) inhibitor, LY333531, and mimicked by a PKCbeta(I/II) activator, 12-deoxyphorbol-13-phenylacetate-20- (dPPA). Western blotting of brain capillary extracts with phospho-specific antibodies showed that dPPA activated PKCbeta(I), but not PKCbeta(II). Moreover, in intact rats, intracarotid infusion of dPPA potently increased brain accumulation of the P-glycoprotein substrate, [(3)H]-verapamil without compromising  integrity. Thus, PKCbeta(I) activation selectively reduced P-glycoprotein activity both in vitro and in vivo. Targeting PKCbeta(I) at the BBB may prove to be an effective strategy for enhancing the delivery of small molecule therapeutics to the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11477572>Relation of the induction of epidermal ornithine decarboxylase and hyperplasia to the different skin tumor-promotion susceptibilities of protein kinase C alpha, -delta and -epsilon transgenic mice.</a></h2><p>To define the in vivo role of individual PKC isoforms in mouse skin carcinogenesis, we previously characterized FVB/n transgenic mice that over-expressed epitope-tagged PKC delta (T7-PKC delta) or PKC epsilon (T7-PKC epsilon) isoforms under the regulation of the human K14 promoter. In continuation of our prior PKC isoform specificity studies, we now report the generation of FVB/n transgenic mice with K14-regulated, epitope-tagged PKC alpha (T7-PKC alpha). T7-PKC alpha transgenic mice (line 115) express 8-fold more PKC alpha protein than wild-type mice. Using high-resolution immunogold cytochemistry, we determined that transgenic over-expression of T7-PKC alpha did not alter the subcellular localization of PKC alpha but that the density of PKC alpha staining increased. PKC alpha localized primarily to the cytoskeleton (tonofilaments, ) and cell membranes, with modest but definite nuclear labeling also identified. Also, PKC alpha over-expression did not alter the immunoreactive protein levels of other PKC isoforms (delta, epsilon, eta, zeta, mu) in the epidermis. Skin tumor-promotion susceptibility was compared among all 3 lines of T7-PKC transgenic mice (alpha, delta and epsilon). While T7-PKC alpha had no effect on skin tumor promotion by TPA, T7-PKC delta reduced papilloma burden by 76% compared to wild-type controls. T7-PKC epsilon further reduced papilloma burden to 93% compared to wild-type controls but still resulted in the development of squamous-cell carcinoma. To find potential mechanisms of PKC-associated differences in tumor promotion, the induction of known downstream effectors of tumor promotion, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and epidermal hyperplasia, was determined. Despite long-term papilloma inhibition in both PKC delta and PKC epsilon transgenic mice, the induction of ODC by TPA was not attenuated in PKC delta and epsilon mouse lines. Both PKC transgenic and wild-type mice exhibited sustained hyperplasia after repeated TPA treatments. However, TPA-induced epidermal hyperplasia in T7-PKC epsilon mice was significantly increased (52%) compared with T7-PKC alpha, T7-PKC delta and wild-type mice. TPA-induced ODC activity and the resultant accumulation of polyamines may play different roles (e.g., induction of apoptosis vs. proliferation) in the pathways leading to the induction of cancer in PKC alpha, PKC delta and PKC epsilon transgenic mice.Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9166410>Protein kinase C activation upregulates intercellular adhesion of alpha-catenin-negative human colon cancer cell variants via induction of desmosomes.</a></h2><p>The alpha-catenin molecule links E-cadherin/ beta-catenin or E-cadherin/plakoglobin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton. We studied several invasive human colon carcinoma cell lines lacking alpha-catenin. They showed a solitary and rounded morphotype that correlated with increased invasiveness. These round cell variants acquired a more normal epithelial phenotype upon transfection with an alpha-catenin expression plasmid, but also upon treatment with the protein kinase C (PKC) activator 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13- (TPA). Video registrations showed that the cells started to establish elaborated intercellular  within 30 min after addition of TPA. Interestingly, this normalizing TPA effect was not associated with alpha-catenin induction. Classical and confocal immunofluorescence showed only minor TPA-induced changes in E-cadherin staining. In contrast, desmosomal and  junctional proteins were dramatically rearranged, with a conversion from cytoplasmic clusters to obvious concentration at cell-cell contacts and exposition at the exterior cell surface. Electron microscopical observations revealed the TPA-induced appearance of typical desmosomal plaques. TPA-restored cell-cell adhesion was E-cadherin dependent as demonstrated by a blocking antibody in a cell aggregation assay. Addition of an antibody against the extracellular part of desmoglein-2 blocked the TPA effect, too. Remarkably, the combination of anti-E-cadherin and anti-desmoglein antibodies synergistically inhibited the TPA effect. Our studies show that it is possible to bypass the need for normal alpha-catenin expression to establish  intercellular adhesion by epithelial cells. Apparently, the underlying mechanism comprises upregulation of desmosomes and  by activation of the PKC signaling pathway, whereas E-cadherin remains essential for basic cell-cell adhesion, even in the absence of alpha-catenin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25864708>Celiac disease 2015 update: new therapies.</a></h2><p>Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic, small intestinal, immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Currently, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only available treatment. However, GFD alone is not sufficient to relieve symptoms, control small intestinal inflammation and prevent long-term complications in many patients. The GFD has its challenges including issues related to adherence, lifestyle restrictions and cost. As a result, there is growing interest in and a need for non-dietary therapies to manage this condition. In recent years, different targets in the immune-mediated cascade of CD have been identified in clinical and pre-clinical trials for potential therapies. This review will discuss the latest non-dietary therapies in CD, including endopeptidases, modulators of enterocyte tight junctions and agents involved in gluten tolerization and immunomodulation. We will also discuss the potential implications of approved therapeutics on CD clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28852737>PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF ETHYL  EXTRACTION FROM GASTRODIA ELATA BLUME ON BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER IN FOCAL CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA REPERFUSION.</a></h2><p>Damage of the blood brain barrier (BBB) during the process of cerebral ischemic injury is a key factor which influences the therapeutic efficacy to the cerebral ischemic injury. The present study was designed to verify the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of the ethyl  (EtOAc) extraction from Gastrodia elata Blume (GEB) on the BBB by developing a model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats.MCAO/R model in rats was developed through a thread embolism method. The neurological scales, the moisture and the evans blue (EB) contents of brains were detected. Meanwhile, the release of nitric oxide (NO) and activities of NO synthase (NOS) in brain tissues were measured. Western blotting analyses were also performed to assess the protein expressions of AQP-4, Occludin and Claudin-5 in brain tissue.After rats were pretreated with different concentrations of EtOAc extractions from GEB, the neurologic scores, the EB contents in the brain tissues and the moisture of the brains were significantly decreased. Meanwhile, the release of NO, the activities of nNOS and iNOS were notably inhibited. Furthemore, the protein expression of AQP-4 was markedly decreased, but the protein expressions of -5 and Occludin were significantly increased.the EtOAc extracts of GEB may decrease the permeability of BBB when focal cerebral ischemia occurs. The inhibition of the NOS pathways, the attenuation of the protein expression of AQP-4 and the enhancement of the expressions of the  proteins may contribute to the protective effects of the EtOAc extracts from GEB on BBB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20697888>Protein kinase C activation has distinct effects on the localization, phosphorylation and detergent solubility of the claudin protein family in  and leaky epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that protein kinase C (PKC) activation has distinct effects on the structure and barrier properties of cultured epithelial cells (HT29 and MDCK I). Since the claudin family of  (TJ)-associated proteins is considered to be crucial for the function of mature TJ, we assessed their expression patterns and cellular destination, detergent solubility and phosphorylation upon PKC stimulation for 2 or 18 h with phorbol myristate  (PMA). In HT29 cells, claudins 1, 3, 4 and 5 and possibly claudin 2 were redistributed to apical cell-cell contacts after PKC activation and the amounts of claudins 1, 3 and 5, but not of claudin 2, were increased in cell lysates. By contrast, in MDCK I cells, PMA treatment resulted in redistribution of claudins 1, 3, 4 and 5 from the TJ and in reorganization of the proteins into more insoluble complexes. Claudins 1 and 4 were phosphorylated in both MDCK I and HT29 cells, but PKC-induced changes in claudin phosphorylation state were detected only in MDCK I cells. A major difference between HT29 and MDCK I cells, which have low and high basal transepithelial electrical resistance, respectively, was the absence of claudin 2 in the latter. Our findings show that PKC activation targets in characteristic ways the expression patterns, destination, detergent solubility and phosphorylation state of claudins in epithelial cells with different capacities to form an epithelial barrier.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26268064>Enhancing Effect of Trachelogenin from Trachelospermi caulis Extract on Intestinal Barrier Function.</a></h2><p>Trachelospermi caulis is used widely as an herbal medicine in oriental countries to attenuate fever and pain. We wished to reveal the novel function of this herb and its active component on barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells. Monolayers of intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) were used to evaluate the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and quantity of permeated ovalbumin (OVA) as indices of barrier function. T. caulis increased TEER values on cell monolayers and decreased OVA permeation across cell monolayers. To ascertain the active component of T. caulis, the extract was isolated to five fractions, and the effect of each of these fractions on intestinal barrier function examined. Chloroform and ethyl  fractions showed increased TEER values and decreased OVA flux. Chloroform and ethyl  fractions contained mainly trachelogenin and its glycoside, tracheloside. Trachelogenin increased TEER values and decreased OVA flux by enhancing the  protein occludin (but not tracheloside) in Caco-2 monolayers. These findings demonstrated that trachelogenin, an active component of T. caulis, might help to attenuate food allergy or inflammatory bowel disease through inhibition of allergen permeation or enhancement of the intestinal barrier.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8950609>Pyrogallol red-vanadium complex-a new stain for electron microscopy.</a></h2><p>We report on the application of a pyrogallol red-vanadium complex (PR-V) for ultracytochemical staining of proteinaceous structures in animal tissues and cell cultures. This dye may be used as a general purpose stain in electron microscopy. In contrast to osmium tetroxide, the price of the material is low and no toxic vapors are produced. The PR-V complex was prepared by addition of vanadium (IV) oxide sulfate to pyrogallol red dissolved in  buffer (pH 5.6). The formation of the complex was indicated by a color change from purple-red (lambda max = 520 nm) to violet (lambda max = 539 nm) which occurred at equimolar concentrations of the dye and the metal salt. Under these conditions PR-V was stable for several days. The mechanism of PR-V binding was checked in dot blots using different proteins as well as heparin for control. While heparin remained unstained, proteins were stained in a dose-dependent manner. Deamination of proteins with nitric oxide strongly reduced PR-V staining in dot blots as well as in cell cultures. Optimal staining results of animal cells and tissues were obtained in specimens that had been mildly fixed for at least 1 h or longer with a mixture of 0.1% glutaraldehyde and 1.0% paraformaldehyde dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, washed with  buffer, pH 5.6, and subsequently treated with PR-V in the presence of 50% ethanol at room temperature. Control specimens without PR-V but treated en bloc with uranyl  or sodium molybdate showed similar contrast but less details in the ultrastructure of the tissue. All specimens were embedded in epoxy resin and ultratain sections were stained conventionally with uranyl and lead salt solutions. In electron micrographs, membrane-associated particles, stress fibers and filaments of the cell cortex, collagen fibrils,  and desmosomes, and other proteinaceous components were clearly visualized only in the PR-V-treated specimens. In conclusion, the ability to bind selectively and specifically to protein-aceous structures makes PR-V a versatile stain to study the localization and distribution of these structures in cells and tissues at the ultrastructural level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12354099>Role of nectin in organization of  in epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>In polarized epithelial cells, cell-cell adhesion forms specialized membrane structures comprised of claudin-based  (TJs) and of E-cadherin-based adherens  (AJs). These structures are aligned from the apical to the basal side of the lateral membrane, but the mechanism of this organization remains unknown. Nectin is a Ca2+ independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecule which localizes at AJs. Nectin is associated with E-cadherin through their respective cytoplasmic tail-binding proteins, afadin and catenins, and involved in the formation of AJs in cooperation with E-cadherin. We show here that nectin is also involved in the formation of TJs.During the formation of the junctional complex consisting of AJs and TJs in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, claudin and occludin accumulated at the apical sites of the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites. This accumulation of claudin and occludin was inhibited by inhibitors acting on the trans interaction of nectin. The barrier function of TJs was also impaired by the nectin inhibitors. It has been shown that a phorbol ester promotes the formation of a TJ-like structure in an E-cadherin-independent manner. This phorbol ester-induced formation of the TJ-like structure was also inhibited by the nectin inhibitors.These results suggest a role of the nectin-afadin system in the organization of TJs as well as AJs in epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312663>Severe burn injury alters intestinal microbiota composition and impairs intestinal  in mice.</a></h2><p>The intestinal   is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis, and the mechanisms of intestinal  disruption induced by burn injury remain obscure. This study was aimed to investigate the changes of intestinal microbiota and  function in burned mice to further comprehend the mechanisms of burn-induced intestinal  dysfunction.Samples were from mice inflicted with 30% total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness burns. The intestinal permeability, tight junction proteins expressions, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) localization, inflammatory cytokines expressions, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents were determined. The microbial community was assessed via 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing.The intestinal permeability was increased after severe burn injury, peaking at 6 h post-burn, with approximately 20-folds of the control ( < 0.001). The expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-2) was significantly altered ( < 0.05). The ZO-1 morphology was dramatically changed following burn injury. The fecal SCFAs' contents (, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were noticeably declined after burn injury ( < 0.05). The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6) in ileal mucosa were increased, whereas the expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) were decreased following burn injury ( < 0.05). In addition, burned mice showed an alteration of intestinal microbial community, such as decreased diversity, reduced  abundance, and increased  abundance.The severe burn-induced intestinal  dysfunction is along with the alterations of microbial community.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24790027>Toll-like receptor 2 activation by β2→1-fructans protects   of T84 human intestinal epithelial cells in a chain length-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Dietary fiber intake is associated with lower incidence and mortality from disease, but the underlying mechanisms of these protective effects are unclear. We hypothesized that β2→1-fructan dietary fibers confer protection on intestinal epithelial cell   via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and we studied whether β2→1-fructan chain-length differences affect this process. T84 human intestinal epithelial cell monolayers were incubated with 4 β2→1-fructan formulations of different chain-length compositions and were stimulated with the proinflammatory phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA). Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was analyzed by electric cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) as a measure for tight junction-mediated  . To confirm TLR2 involvement in  modulation by β2→1-fructans, ECIS experiments were repeated using TLR2 blocking antibody. After preincubation of T84 cells with short-chain β2→1-fructans, the decrease in TEER as induced by PMA (62.3 ± 5.2%, P < 0.001) was strongly attenuated (15.2 ± 8.8%, P < 0.01). However, when PMA was applied first, no effect on recovery was observed during addition of the fructans. By blocking TLR2 on the T84 cells, the protective effect of short-chain β2→1-fructans was substantially inhibited. Stimulation of human embryonic kidney human TLR2 reporter cells with β2→1-fructans induced activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, confirming that β2→1-fructans are specific ligands for TLR2. To conclude, β2→1-fructans exert time-dependent and chain length-dependent protective effects on the T84 intestinal epithelial cell  mediated via TLR2. These results suggest that TLR2 located on intestinal epithelial cells could be a target of β2→1-fructan-mediated health effects.© 2014 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11812992>JAM-1 is a ligand of the beta(2) integrin LFA-1 involved in transendothelial migration of leukocytes.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory recruitment of leukocytes is governed by dynamic interactions between integrins and endothelial immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) proteins. We have identified the IgSF member junctional adhesion molecule 1 (JAM-1) as a ligand of the beta(2) integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1). Under static and physiological flow conditions, JAM-1 contributed to LFA-1-dependent transendothelial migration of T cells and neutrophils as well as LFA-1-mediated arrest of T cells. The latter was triggered by chemokines on endothelium that was stimulated with cytokines to redistribute JAM-1 from the . Transfectants expressing JAM-1 supported LFA-1-mediated adhesion of leukocytes, which required the membrane-proximal Ig-like domain 2 of JAM-1. Thus, JAM-1 is a counter-receptor for LFA-1 that is ideally situated to guide and control transmigration during leukocyte recruitment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3045132>Fetal type 2 pneumocytes form alveolar-like structures and maintain long-term differentiation on extracellular matrix.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effects of reconstituted basement membrane (a crude extract of the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor) on type 2 pneumocyte differentiation during long-term culture. Cells were derived from mature 29 d fetal rabbits. Morphology was studied by light and electron microscopy. On thin gel, the cells initially segregated into clumps; they were cuboidal with apical microvilli and contained lamellar bodies, but dedifferentiated by 8 d. On thick gel, epithelial cells associated into spherical clusters surrounding a central lumen. These alveolarlike structures persisted at least 22 d. The cells were cuboidal and had lamellar bodies and intercellular ; they exhibited polarity, with apical microvilli facing the lumen, basally located nuclei, and gel matrix abutting the basal surface. In contrast, cells cultured on plastic formed colonies, then a monolayer, but dedifferentiated 5-7 d after plating. [14C] was used to label newly synthesized phospholipids. The amount of disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC), expressed as a percentage of total phosphatidylcholine (PC), was used as an indicator of surfactant lipid production; percentage DSPC synthesized by cells cultured on thick gel did not change significantly, from 55 +/- 3 at 3 d, to 63 +/- 2 at 22 d in culture. DSPC synthesized by cells cultured on plastic decreased from 57 +/- 1% at 3 d to 45 +/- 2% at 22 d (p less than 0.001), which is consistent with the morphologic evidence of dedifferentiation. Synthesis of total PC compared with total phospholipid did not vary with either time in culture or substrate. This study emphasizes the importance of a complex extracellular matrix for maintenance of type 2 pneumocyte differentiation. The system should prove useful for studying the interaction of these cells with basement membrane, including the role of events occurring at the cell surface in modulating expression of a differentiated phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16936117>Histamine-induced phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin II disrupts the barrier integrity of corneal endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>To investigate histamine-induced changes in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) and its influence on the barrier integrity of corneal endothelial cells through altered contractility of the actin cytoskeleton.Experiments were performed in cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells (BCECs). Phosphorylation of MLC, which increases contractility of the actin cytoskeleton through actomyosin interaction, was assessed by urea-glycerol gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Immunocytochemistry was used to locate phosphorylated MLC in relation to . Phosphorylation of the 17-kDa PKC-potentiated inhibitory protein of type 1 protein phosphatase (CPI-17), which inhibits MLC phosphatase, was studied using Western blot analysis. The cortical actin cytoskeleton was visualized by staining with Texas-red phalloidin. Barrier integrity was determined by quantifying horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 44 kDa) flux across cells grown on porous filters.RT-PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of Galphaq/11-coupled H1 receptors in BCECs. Exposure to histamine (100 microM; 10 minutes) led to phosphorylation of MLC (134% relative to untreated cells) and of CPI-17. Histamine also increased the flux of HRP by sevenfold and disrupted the assembly of the dense cortical actin found in resting cells. PKC activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA; 100 nM; 30 minutes) caused phosphorylation of both MLC and CPI-17. The histamine-induced MLC phosphorylation was reduced by pre-exposure to either ML-7 (50 microM), an MLCK (MLC kinase) inhibitor, or chelerythrine (10 microM), an inhibitor of PKC. Cotreatment with agents that elevate cAMP in BCECs prevented the histamine-induced MLC phosphorylation and the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, and increased HRP flux. Phosphorylated MLC in response to histamine or PMA was found in a punctate form in close proximity to ZO-1, a marker of the  junctional complex.Histamine induces MLC phosphorylation by activating MLCK and partly inhibiting MLC phosphatase. The latter is facilitated by the phosphorylation of CPI-17. Localization of phosphorylated MLC in proximity to ZO-1 suggests increased contractility of the cortical actin at the  junctional complex. This contractility oppose the tethering forces and lead to a breakdown of the barrier integrity. Last, elevated cAMP prevents histamine-induced loss of the barrier integrity, not only by blocking inactivation of MLC phosphatase but also by inactivating MLCK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11082294>The transient increase of  permeability induced by bryostatin 1 correlates with rapid downregulation of protein kinase C-alpha.</a></h2><p>The role of PKC-alpha in altered epithelial barrier permeability following the activation of PKC by TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-) and bryostatin 1 in LLC-PK1 cells was investigated in this study. Like TPA, bryostatin 1 binds to and activates PKC but unlike TPA, it is not a tumor promoter. TPA at 10(-7) M induced a sustained 95% decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (R(t)) across LLC-PK1 epithelial cell sheets, while 10(-7) M bryostatin 1 caused only a 30% decrease in R(t), which spontaneously reversed after 5 h. Simultaneous exposure of cell sheets to 10(-7) M TPA and 10(-7) M bryostatin 1 blunted the increase in epithelial permeability observed with 10(-7) M TPA alone. Co-incubation of cell sheets with bryostatin 1 and MG-132, a proteasomal inhibitor, caused a further decrease in R(t) at the 6-h time point and inhibited the recovery in R(t) seen with bryostatin 1 alone at this time point. TPA caused a rapid translocation of PKC-alpha from the cytosol to the membrane of the cell where it remained elevated. Bryostatin 1 treatment resulted in a slower translocation of PKC-alpha from the cytosol to the membrane and a much more rapid downregulation of PKC-alpha, with disappearance from this compartment after only 6 h. The classical PKC inhibitor Go6976 prevented the decrease in R(t) seen with TPA. Treatment of cells with TPA and bryostatin 1 resulted in a PKC-alpha translocation and downregulation profile which more closely resembled that seen with bryostatin 1 alone. Co-incubation of cells with MG-132 and bryostatin 1 caused a slower downregulation of PKC-alpha from the membrane fraction. Bryostatin 1 treatment of cells expressing a dominant/negative form of PKC-alpha resulted in a slower and less extensive decrease in R(t) compared to the corresponding control cells. For both TPA and bryostatin 1, the level of PKC-alpha in the membrane-associated fraction of the treated cells correlated closely with increased transepithelial permeability. Due to its transient effect on  permeability, bryostatin 1 offers a novel pharmacological tool to investigate junctional physiology.Copyright 2000 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24015300>The Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) undergoes ectodomain shedding and regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP).</a></h2><p>The Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) is a cell adhesion molecule originally characterized as a virus receptor but subsequently shown to be involved in physiological processes such as neuronal and heart development, epithelial tight junction integrity, and tumour suppression. Proteolysis of cell adhesion molecules and a wide variety of other cell surface proteins serves as a mechanism for protein turnover and, in some cases, cell signaling. Metalloproteases such as A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease (ADAM) family members cleave cell surface receptors to release their substrates' ectodomains, while the presenilin/ɣ-secretase complex mediates regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), releasing intracellular domain fragments from the plasma membrane. In the case of some substrates such as Notch and amyloid precursor protein (APP), the released intracellular domains enter the nucleus to modulate gene expression. We report that CAR ectodomain is constitutively shed from glioma cells and developing neurons, and is also shed when cells are treated with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and the calcium ionophore ionomycin. We identified ADAM10 as a sheddase of CAR using assays involving shRNA knockdown and rescue, overexpression of wild-type ADAM10 and inhibition of ADAM10 activity by addition of its prodomain. In vitro peptide cleavage, mass spectrometry and mutagenesis revealed the amino acids M224 to L227 of CAR as the site of ADAM10-mediated ectodomain cleavage. CAR also undergoes RIP by the presenilin/γ-secretase complex, and the intracellular domain of CAR enters the nucleus. Ectodomain shedding is a prerequisite for RIP of CAR. Thus, CAR belongs to the increasing list of cell surface molecules that undergo ectodomain shedding and that are substrates for ɣ-secretase-mediated RIP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8321620>Effects of phorbol ester on gap  of neonatal rat heart cells.</a></h2><p>Myocytes were isolated from the ventricles of neonatal rat hearts and cultured for 1-3 days. Newly formed cell pairs were used to examine the conductance of gap , gj. Measurements were performed using a dual voltage-clamp method in conjunction with a whole-cell, -seal recording. Exposure to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA, 100-160 nM) led to a decrease in gj. Single-channel events recorded immediately before complete uncoupling yielded a single-channel conductance, gamma j, of 40.5 pS, implying that TPA affects the channel kinetics rather than gamma j. TPA-induced uncoupling was observed at subphysiological levels of cytosolic Ca2+ (pipette solution = 18 nM), not at physiological levels (pipette solution = 170 nM). The effects of TPA could not be mimicked by 250 microM 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (OAG). Preincubation with TPA (up to 24 h) revealed no changes in gj attributable to down-regulation of protein kinase C, PKC. Pretreatment with PKC inhibitors, staurosporine or PKCI, prevented the TPA-dependent decrease in gj. TPA-dependent uncoupling was not impaired by 4-bromophenacyl bromide, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2, PLA2; conversely, an arachidonic acid-dependent decrease in gj was not prevented by PKCI. This suggests that gj regulation does not involve an interaction between PLA2 and PKC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8825530>Regulation of  resistance in T84 monolayers by elevation in intracellular Ca2+: a protein kinase C effect.</a></h2><p>Elevation in intracellular Ca2+ acting via protein kinase C (PKC) is shown to regulate  resistance in T84 cells, a human colon cancer line and a model Cl- secretory epithelial cell. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187, which was used to increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, caused a decrease in  resistance in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Dual Na+/mannitol serosal-to-mucosal flux analysis performed across the T84 monolayers treated with 2 microM A23187 revealed that A23187 increased both fluxes and that in the presence of ionophore there was a linear relationship between the Na+ and mannitol fluxes with a slope of 56.4, indicating that the decrease in transepithelial resistance was due to a decrease in  resistance. Whereas there was no effect of 0.1 microM A23187, 1 or 2 microM produced a 55% decrease in baseline resistance in 1 hr and 10 microM decreased resistance more than 80%. The A23187-induced decrease in  resistance was partially reversible by washing 3 times with a Ringer's-HCO3 solution containing 1% BSA. The A23187 effect on resistance was dependent on intracellular Ca2+; loading the T84 cells with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA significantly reduced the decrease in  resistance caused by A23187. This intracellular Ca2+ effect was mediated by protein kinase C and not calmodulin. While the protein kinase C antagonist H-7 totally prevented the action of A23187 on  resistance, the Ca2+/calmodulin inhibitor W13 did not have any effect. Sphingosine, another inhibitor of PKC, partially reduced the A23187-induced decline in  resistance. The PKC agonist PMA mimicked the A23187 effect on resistance, although the effect was delayed up to 1 hr after exposure. In addition, however, PMA also caused an earlier increase in resistance, indicating it had an additional effect in addition to mimicking the effect of elevating Ca2+. The effects of a phospholipase inhibitor (mepacrine) and of inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism (indomethacin for the cyclooxygenase pathway, NDGA for the lipoxygenase pathway, and SKF 525A for the epoxygenase pathway) on the A23187 action were also examined. None of these agents altered the A23187-induced decrease in resistance. Monolayers exposed to 2 microM A23187 for 1 hr were stained with fluorescein conjugated phalloidin, revealing that neighboring cells did not part one from another and that A23187 did not have a detectable effect on distribution of F-actin in the perijunctional actomyosin ring. The results indicate that elevation in intracellular Ca2+ decreases  resistance in the T84 monolayer, acting through protein kinase C by a mechanism which does not involve visible changes in the perijunctional actomyosin ring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26173414>ALDH2 Deficiency Promotes Ethanol-Induced Gut  Dysfunction and Fatty Liver in Mice.</a></h2><p>Acetaldehyde, the toxic ethanol (EtOH) metabolite, disrupts intestinal epithelial  . Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) detoxifies acetaldehyde into . Subpopulations of Asians and Native Americans show polymorphism with loss-of- mutations in ALDH2. We evaluated the effect of ALDH2 deficiency on EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions and adherens junctions, gut  dysfunction, and liver injury.Wild-type and ALDH2-deficient mice were fed EtOH (1 to 6%) in Lieber-DeCarli diet for 4 weeks. Gut permeability in vivo was measured by plasma-to-luminal flux of FITC-inulin, tight junction and adherens junction integrity was analyzed by confocal microscopy, and liver injury was assessed by the analysis of plasma transaminase activity, histopathology, and liver triglyceride.EtOH feeding elevated colonic mucosal acetaldehyde, which was significantly greater in ALDH2-deficient mice. ALDH2(-/-) mice showed a drastic reduction in the EtOH diet intake. Therefore, this study was continued only in wild-type and ALDH2(+/-) mice. EtOH feeding elevated mucosal inulin permeability in distal colon, but not in proximal colon, ileum, or jejunum of wild-type mice. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, EtOH-induced inulin permeability in distal colon was not only higher than that in wild-type mice, but inulin permeability was also elevated in the proximal colon, ileum, and jejunum. Greater inulin permeability in distal colon of ALDH2(+/-) mice was associated with a more severe redistribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins from the intercellular junctions. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, but not in wild-type mice, EtOH feeding caused a loss of junctional distribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins in the ileum. Histopathology, plasma transaminases, and liver triglyceride analyses showed that EtOH-induced liver damage was significantly greater in ALDH2(+/-) mice compared to wild-type mice.These data demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency enhances EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions,  dysfunction, and liver damage.Copyright © 2015 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15485832>The junctional adhesion molecule-C promotes neutrophil transendothelial migration in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>The third member of the family of junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), JAM-3, also called JAM-C, was recently shown to be a novel counter-receptor on platelets for the leukocyte beta(2)-integrin Mac-1 (alphaMbeta(2), CD11b/CD18). Here, new functional aspects of the role of endothelial cell JAM-C were investigated. Endothelial cells express JAM-C, which is predominantly localized within  at interendothelial contacts, since it codistributes with a  component, zonula occludens-1. Whereas JAM-C does not participate in neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, it mediates neutrophil transmigration in a Mac-1-dependent manner. In particular, inhibition of JAM-C significantly reduced neutrophil transendothelial migration, and the combination of JAM-C and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 blockade almost completely abolished neutrophil transendothelial migration in vitro. In vivo, inhibition of JAM-C with soluble mouse JAM-C resulted in a 50% reduction of neutrophil emigration in the mouse model of acute thioglycollate-induced peritonitis. Thus, JAM-C participates in neutrophil transmigration and thereby provides a novel molecular target for antagonizing interactions between vascular cells that promote inflammatory vascular pathologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10430658>Redistribution and phosphorylation of occludin during opening and resealing of  in cultured epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>We studied the expression, distribution, and phosphorylation of the  (TJ) protein occludin in confluent MDCK cell monolayers following three procedures for opening and resealing of TJs. When Ca(2+) is transiently removed from the culture medium, the TJs open and the cells separate from each other, but the occludin band around each cell is retained. When Ca(2+) is reintroduced, the TJs reseal. When the monolayers are exposed to prolonged Ca(2+) starvation the cells maintain contact, but occludin disappears from the cell borders and can be detected only in a cytoplasmic compartment. When Ca(2+) is reintroduced, new TJs are assembled and the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) is reestablished in about 20 hr. Monolayers treated with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) show a different pattern of TJ opening: the cell-cell contact is maintained but the TJ strand network, as seen in freeze-fracture replicas, becomes discontinuous. Occludin is still localized at the cell periphery, but in a pattern of distribution that matches the discontinuous TJ. These TJs do not reseal even 24 hr after removal of the TPA. Western blot analysis showed that the 62-65 kD double band of occludin did not change with these treatments. However, in vivo phosphorylation analysis showed that the TPA treatment reduced the phosphorylation levels of occludin, while the prolonged Ca(2+) starvation completely dephosphorylated the two occludin bands. In addition, a highly phosphorylated 71 kD band that immunoprecipitates with occludin is not present when TJ is opened by the Ca(2+) removal. Phosphoaminoacid analysis showed that the 62-65 kD occludin bands are phosphorylated on serine and threonine, while the 71 kD band was phosphorylated exclusively on serine. Our results provide further evidence that phosphorylation of occludin is an important step in regulating TJ formation and permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3127401>Effects of diacylglycerols on LLC-PK1 renal epithelia: similarity to phorbol ester tumor promoters.</a></h2><p>As previously shown using phorbol ester tumor promoters (see Mullin and O'Brien: Am. J. Physiol., 251:C597-C602, 1986), diacylglycerols induce leakiness in LLC-PK1 renal epithelial . The similarity between phorbol ester and diacylglycerol action includes effects on 1) cell morphology, 2) dome formation, 3) transepithelial resistance and potential difference, 4) transepithelial flux of D-mannitol, and 5) mitogenesis. Four diacylglycerols have been tested: 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol; 1,2-dicaprylglycerol; 1,2-dioleoylglycerol; and 1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-sn-3-glycerol. Their relative effectiveness depended upon the phenomenon being observed. Unlike phorbol esters, diacylglycerol effects were reversible within hours at 37 degrees C in the continued presence of diacylglycerol, and effects were more pronounced when cell sheets were exposed to diacylglycerols from the basolateral cell surface. Overall, these findings indicate that previous results with phorbol esters may be attributed to the protein kinase C signal transduction system, and this system may therefore exert a role in transepithelial permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18477669>Protein kinase C enhances  barrier function of human nasal epithelial cells in primary culture by transcriptional regulation.</a></h2><p>The epithelium of upper respiratory tissues such as human nasal mucosa forms a continuous barrier via , which is thought to be regulated in part through a protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. To investigate the mechanisms of the regulation of PKC-mediated  barrier function of human nasal epithelium in detail, primary human nasal epithelial cells were treated with the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylophorbol-13- (TPA). In primary human nasal epithelial cells, treatment with TPA led not only to activation of phosphorylation of PKC, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, and mitogen-activated protein kinase but also expression of novel PKC-delta, PKC-theta, and PKC-epsilon. Treatment with TPA increased transepithelial electrical resistance, with  barrier function more than 4-fold that of the control, together with up-regulation of  proteins, occludin, zona occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2 and claudin-1 at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, it affected the subcellular localization of the  proteins and the numbers of  strands. The up-regulation of barrier function and  proteins was prevented by a pan-PKC inhibitor, and the inhibitors of PKC-delta and PKC-theta but not PKC-epsilon. In primary human nasal epithelial cells, transcriptional factors GATA-3 and -6 were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The knockdown of GATA-3 using RNA interference resulted in inhibition of up-regulation of ZO-1 and ZO-2 by treatment with TPA. These results suggest that TPA-induced PKC signaling enhances the barrier function of human nasal epithelial cells via transcriptional up-regulation of  proteins, and the mechanisms may contribute to a drug delivery system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18723323>Short-chain fatty acids and trichostatin A alter  permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), butyrate, propionate, and , produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber, can modulate the transcription of certain genes by inhibiting histone deacetylase in colonocytes and several other cell types in vitro. We previously reported that butyrate decreases  permeability by activating lipoxygenase (LOX) in intestinal monolayer cells. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of SCFAs on  permeability in an endothelial cell culture and their possible mechanisms of action via histone deacetylase inhibitor activity. We also investigated the factors modulating  permeability.The effects of butyrate, propionate, and  on  permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells were examined using Transwell chamber cultures. The contributions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS), endothelial NOS, estrogen receptor, cyclo-oxygenase, and LOX to SCFAs' effects were also evaluated. The effects of SCFAs were compared with those of trichostatin A, a typical histone deacetylase inhibitor.Low concentrations of butyrate and propionate decreased paracellular permeability without inducing cell damage. However,  decreased paracellular permeability in a concentration-dependent manner. An estrogen receptor antagonist attenuated the effects of SCFAs on  permeability. The influences of inducible NOS, cyclo-oxygenase, and LOX inhibitors and the expressions of cyclo-oxygenase and LOX mRNAs were different for each SCFA. Trichostatin A slightly decreased paracellular permeability when used at lower concentrations, but higher concentrations of trichostatin A increased permeability.The SCFAs play an important role in the assembly of  in normal vascular endothelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18381207>Reproductive hormones regulate the selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier.</a></h2><p>Reproductive hormones have been demonstrated to modulate both gap and  protein expression in the ovary and other reproductive tissues, however the effects of changes in reproductive hormones on the selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remain unclear. Age-related declines in BBB integrity correlate with the loss of serum sex steroids and increase in gonadotropins with menopause/andropause. To examine the effect of reproductive senescence on BBB permeability and gap and  protein expression/localization, female mice at 3 months of age were either sham operated (normal serum E2 and gonadotropins), ovariectomized (low serum E2 and high serum gonadotropins) or ovariectomized and treated with the GnRH agonist leuprolide  (low serum E2 and gonadotropins). Ovariectomy induced a 2.2-fold increase in Evan's blue dye extravasation into the brain. The expression and localization of the cytoplasmic membrane-associated  protein zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) in microvessels was not altered among groups indicating that the increased paracellular permeability was not due to changes in this  protein. However, ovariectomy induced a redistribution of the gap  protein connexin-43 (Cx43) such that immunoreactivity relocalized from along the extracellular microvascular endothelium to become associated with endothelial cells. An increase in Cx43 expression in the mouse brain following ovariectomy was suppressed in ovariectomized animals treated with leuprolide , indicating that serum gonadotropins rather than sex steroids were modulating Cx43 expression. These results suggest that elevated serum gonadotropins following reproductive senescence may be one possible cause of the loss of selective permeability of the BBB at this time. Furthermore, these findings implicate Cx43 in mediating changes in BBB permeability, and serum gonadotropins in the cerebropathophysiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21832130>Sheep rumen and omasum primary cultures and source epithelia: barrier function aligns with expression of  proteins.</a></h2><p>The forestomachs of cows and sheep have historically served as important models for the study of epithelial transport. Thus, the ruminal epithelium was among the first tissues in which absorption of chloride against an electrochemical gradient was observed, requiring a  paracellular barrier to prevent back-leakage. However, little is known about ruminal barrier function, despite the considerable implications for ruminant health. The  proteins of the omasum have never been investigated, and no cell culture model exists. We present a new method for the isolation of cells from forestomach epithelia. Protein expression of cells and source tissues of sheep were studied using western blot, PCR and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cultured cells were characterized by transepithelial resistance (TER) measurements and patch clamping. Cells developed TER values of 729±134 Ω cm(2) (rumen) and 1522±126 Ω cm(2) (omasum). Both primary cells and source epithelia of rumen and omasum expressed cytokeratin, occludin and claudins 1, 4 and 7 (but not claudins 2, 3, 5, 8 and 10), consistent with the observed paracellular sealing properties. Staining for claudin-1 reached the stratum basale. The full mRNA coding sequence of claudins 1, 4 and 7 (sheep) was obtained. Patch-clamp analyses of isolated cells proved expression of an anion conductance with a permeability sequence of gluconate<<chloride. This is in accordance with a model that ruminal and omasal transport of anions such as chloride and  has to occur via a transcellular route and involves channel-mediated basolateral efflux, driven by Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26409956>Abundance of ruminal bacteria, epithelial gene expression, and systemic biomarkers of metabolism and inflammation are altered during the peripartal period in dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Seven multiparous Holstein cows with a ruminal fistula were used to investigate the changes in rumen microbiota, gene expression of the ruminal epithelium, and blood biomarkers of metabolism and inflammation during the transition period. Samples of ruminal digesta, biopsies of ruminal epithelium, and blood were obtained during -14 through 28d in milk (DIM). A total of 35 genes associated with metabolism, transport, inflammation, and signaling were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Among metabolic-related genes, expression of HMGCS2 increased gradually from -14 to a peak at 28 DIM, underscoring its central role in epithelial ketogenesis. The decrease of glucose and the increase of nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate in the blood after calving confirmed the state of negative energy balance. Similarly, increases in bilirubin and decreases in albumin concentrations after calving were indicative of alterations in liver function and inflammation. Despite those systemic signs, lower postpartal expression of TLR2, TLR4, CD45, and NFKB1 indicated the absence of inflammation within the epithelium. Alternatively, these could reflect an adaptation to react against inducers of the immune system arising in the rumen (e.g., bacterial endotoxins). The downregulation of RXRA, INSR, and RPS6KB1 between -14 and 10 DIM indicated a possible increase in insulin resistance. However, the upregulation of IRS1 during the same time frame could serve to restore sensitivity to insulin of the epithelium as a way to preserve its proliferative capacity. The upregulation of TGFB1 from -14 and 10 DIM coupled with upregulation of both EGFR and EREG from 10 to 28 DIM indicated the existence of 2 waves of epithelial proliferation. However, the downregulation of TGFBR1 from -14 through 28 DIM indicated some degree of cell proliferation arrest. The downregulation of OCLN and TJP1 from -14 to 10 DIM indicated a loss of  integrity. The gradual upregulation of membrane transporters MCT1 and UTB to peak levels at 28 DIM reflected the higher intake and fermentability of the lactation diet. In addition, those changes in the diet after calving resulted in an increase of butyrate and a decrease of ruminal pH and , which partly explain the increase of Anaerovibrio lipolytica, Prevotella bryantii, and Megasphaera elsdenii and the decrease of fibrolytic bacteria (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus). Overall, these multitier changes revealed important features associated with the transition into lactation. Alterations in ruminal epithelium gene expression could be driven by nutrient intake-induced changes in microbes; microbial metabolism; and the systemic metabolic, hormonal, and immune changes. Understanding causes and mechanisms driving the interaction among ruminal bacteria and host immunometabolic responses merits further study.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

A transient (2-3 min duration) increase in intracellular calcium levels was observed within 20-30 sec of androgen addition, which was followed by a plateau phase with steroid concentrations higher than 1 nM. The kinetics of the calcium responses were similar in immature rat Sertoli cells, which contain normal nuclear receptors; the human prostatic tumor cell line, LNCaP, which contains a mutated nuclear receptor; and the human prostatic cell line, PC3, which does not contain a nuclear receptor. The human A431 tumor cell line did not respond to androgens. Concentrations of testosterone and the synthetic androgen, R1881, between 1-1000 pM induced transient calcium increases with ED(50) values near 1 pM and 1 nM, whereas dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was not active at these concentrations. At concentrations higher than 1 nM, testosterone, R1881, and DHT were equipotent in stimulating an increase in calcium that lasted for more than 10 min, with ED(50) values between 5 and 20 nM. Testosterone covalently bound to albumin was also active, whereas 11 related androstane compounds as well as progesterone and estradiol-17beta were inactive at 1000 nM. The calcium response induced by the three androgens (10 nM) was abolished in all cell types by hydroxyflutamide (1000 nM) and finasteride (1000 nM), but not by cyproterone  (1000 nM). The calcium response was also abolished in the absence of extracellular calcium and strongly inhibited by the presence of verapamil. Exposure of the responsive cells to brief (150-sec) pulses of androgens generated calcium responses that were similar to those after continuous exposure. After exposure of Sertoli cells for only 30 sec to 100 nM testosterone, the calcium response lasted for at least 50 min. Although nuclear binding of androgens could be demonstrated, there was no evidence for  binding to the plasma membrane under similar conditions. When protein synthesis was inhibited, an enhancement of GJIC between rat Sertoli cells, but not between LNCaP cells or PC3 cells, was observed within 15 min of the addition of 10 nM testosterone. Because nuclear androgens are not present in PC3 cells and many functional properties of the responsive system are different from the nuclear receptor in all three cell types, we postulate the existence of an alternative cell surface receptor system with biphasic response characteristics (high and low affinity). The calcium signals are probably coupled to the regulation of gap junctional efficiency between Sertoli cells. The low-affinity receptors may convey complementary androgen signals at elevated local levels such as in the testis, when nuclear receptors are (over)saturated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21790749>Ultrastructural changes in the equine colonic mucosa after ischaemia and reperfusion.</a></h2><p>Ultrastructural changes in the epithelium can provide information on early changes in barrier properties, repair and inflammation in equine colon after ischaemia and reperfusion (I/R).To describe the morphology and ultrastructure of the epithelium in equine large colonic mucosa after I/R, and the response of inflammatory cells to injury.Ischaemia was induced for 1 h followed by 4 h of reperfusion in a 40 cm segment of the pelvic flexure in 6 horses. Mucosal biopsies before and after ischaemia, and after 1, 2 and 4 h of reperfusion were fixed in glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde and osmium tetroxide, and embedded in epon. Morphological and ultrastructural changes were evaluated in toluidine blue-stained semithin sections by light microscopy and in thin sections stained with uranyl /lead citrate by transmission electron microscopy.Ischaemia caused swelling of epithelial cells and their organelles, opening of , detachment from the basement membrane, early apoptosis and single cell necrosis. Autophagy was a prominent feature in epithelial cells after ischaemia. Reperfusion was characterised by apoptosis, epithelial regeneration and restoration of apical cell . Phagocytic-like vacuoles containing cellular debris and bacteria were evident in epithelial cells after reperfusion. Paracellular and subepithelial clefts formed, accompanied by infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils into the epithelium.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a specific multi-fibre mix [MF], designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, on intestinal epithelial barrier function in IL-10 knockout [IL-10(-/-)] mice with spontaneous chronic colitis.IL-10(-/-) mice aged 16 weeks, with established colitis, were used for the experiments with multi-fibre mix diet [MF] for 4 weeks. Severity of colitis, levels of short cahin fatty acids [SCFA] in caecum contents, expression of STAT 3 and STAT 4 proteins, CD4(+) CD45(+) lymphocytes, CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells [Tregs] and cytokines in the lamina propria [LP], epithelial expression of  proteins, TNF-α/TNFR2 mRNA expression, and epithelial apoptosis in the proximal colon were measured at the end of the experiment.MF feeding effectively attenuated disease activity index and colitis associated with decreased lamina propria CD4(+) CD45(+) lymphocytes, IFN-γ/IL-17A mRNA expression, and p-STAT 3 and p-STAT 4 expression in colonic mucosa of IL-10(-/-) mice [p < 0.05]. Furthermore, CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in the LP and concentrations of total SCFA, , propionate, and butyrate in the caecum were markedly increased after MF feeding in IL-10(-/-) mice. After MF feeding, increased epithelial expression and correct localisation of  proteins [occludin and zona occludens protein 1], as well as reduced TNF-α/TNFR2 mRNA expression and epithelial apoptosis, were also observed in IL-10(-/-) mice.These results indicated that EEN supplemented with the tested fibre mix, known to modulate the intestinal microbiota composition and SCFA production, could possibly improve efficacy in inducing remission in patients with active CD.Copyright © 2016 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Isoforms of alpha-DB show different localization in cells and tissues; at basolateral membranes in epithelial cells, dystrobrevins mediate contact with the extracellular matrix, peripheral and transmembrane proteins and the filamentous actin cytoskeleton. Beside their structural role, alpha-DBs are assumed to be important in cell signalling and cell differentiation. We have primarily assessed the role of alpha-DB in two epithelial cell lines (MDCK I, HT 29), which represent different developmental stages and exhibit distinct permeability characteristics. Using a polyclonal anti-alpha-DB antibody, we have investigated its expression, localization and association with  (TJ)- associated proteins (ZO-1, occludin) before and after protein kinase C (PKC) activation with phorbol myristate . Distinct subsets of alpha-DB isoforms were detected in the two cell lines by immunoblotting. In both cell lines there was submembranous localization of alpha-DB both apically and basolaterally, shown with confocal imaging. PKC activation caused a reorganization of TJ, which was parallel to increased localization of alpha-DB to TJ areas, most pronounced in MDCK I cells. Moreover, actin and ZO-1 co-immunoprecipitated with a-DB, as displayed with immunoblotting. Our findings suggest that a-dystrobrevin specifically is associated with the  during their reorganization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1676241>Effects of apical vs. basolateral palytoxin on LLC-PK1 renal epithelia.</a></h2><p>Research on palytoxin focuses on its action as a tumor promoter and its ionophoretic action in cell membranes. The first property is unusual because palytoxin is not a protein kinase C activator. The second property is remarkable in that it may require interaction with the Na(+)-K(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase). Our studies here with palytoxin exposure to the LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells have yielded the following results: 1) unlike protein kinase C-activating tumor promoters (tetradecanoylphorbol 12,13- or teleocidin), palytoxin does not produce a specific effect on the  between epithelia; 2) palytoxin instead produces an irreversible cytotoxic effect characterized by a pronounced cell swelling associated with sharply elevated levels of intracellular Na+ and decreased levels of intracellular K+; 3) these fluctuations in intracellular Na+ and K+ levels are explained by marked elevations in the membrane flux of 22Na+ and 86Rb+; 4) the electrophysiological reflection of these altered ion fluxes is a pronounced depolarization of the cell sheet if palytoxin is presented to the basolateral cell surface and a pronounced hyperpolarization (due to sharply elevated apical Na+ flux and transepithelial short-circuit current) if palytoxin is administered apically; 5) the apical effect of palytoxin can be blocked by apical ouabain; and 6) this apical effect of palytoxin decreases as a function of the age of the cell sheet. This first report of palytoxin action in a polar epithelial cell system provides additional evidence for palytoxin effects being mediated by contact with the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase.

The microcapsules of the LH-RH superagonist leuprorelin  prepared using the new in-water drying method and biodegradable polymers, such as PLGA and PLA, could achieve a long-term sustained release for 1-6 months thereby facilitating easily treatment of hormone-dependent diseases, prostate cancer, endometriosis, and precocious puberty. This DDS technology showed an improvement in patient QOL and highly promoted the clinical value of the agonist. Moreover, PLGA microcapsules of siRNAs against VEGF, cFLIP, Raf-1, and Int6 have also been developed to treat various cancers and arteriosclerosis obliterans. To develop therapeutic nucleotides, a particle design is created using functional peptides, such as cell penetrating peptides (CPP), nuclear localizing signals (NLS),  reversible openers (AT1002), bombesin, and dynein light chain-associated sequences. siRNA use should lead to a paradigm shift in drug discovery against various diseases. Tat analog with NLS could enhance the potency of a vaginal DNA vaccine. The artificial Tat CPP of STR-CH(2)R(4)H(2)C synthesized in our laboratory could efficiently deliver siRNAs into many types of cells and enhance the therapeutic effects for treating sarcoma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma by intratumor injection and inhalation of the nanoparticles.

The worldwide consequences of this therapy are discussed in four categories: (1) adoption of ORT as the primary therapy for acute dehydrating diarrhea; (2) establishment of national ORT programs; (3) scientific knowledge gained from studies into intestinal absorption of oral rehydration solutions; and (4) implications of ORT for the next decade. The Diarrheal Disease Control Program has been assigned a high priority by the World Health Organization. It now includes 99% of the population of the developing world, although it is not uniformly implemented. Because knowledge of how to use ORT parallels implementation, it is hoped that expanded training of community health workers will increase implementation. In addition, specific indications for ORT need further study and refinement so that community health workers may learn to distinguish between diarrheal episodes that require such therapy and those that do not. Better scientific understanding of intestinal absorption of ORT fluids has led to the development of new formulations that enhance absorption of nutrients and repletion of electrolytes. The optimal composition of such revised solutions has yet to be established. In addition to these improvements in utilization, distribution, education, and application of ORT, other measures to reduce the morbidity and mortality from diarrhea can be expected in the areas of better infant feeding practices, improved sanitation, management of persistent diarrhea, targeted therapy for particular groups of infants at high risk, and immunization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30138914>Short-Chain Fatty Acids Manifest Stimulative and Protective Effects on Intestinal Barrier Function Through the Inhibition of NLRP3 Inflammasome and Autophagy.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the major energy resources of intestinal epithelial cells. It has been reported that SCFAs can repair the dysfunction of intestinal barrier, however, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we investigated the stimulative and protective effects of SCFAs on intestinal barrier function and the possible mechanisms.To investigate the effects of SCFAs on intestinal barrier function, the Caco-2 monolayers were exposed to , propionate, butyrate respectively or simultaneously without or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Next, Caco-2 cells were treated with trichostatin A and etomoxir to identify whether SCFAs act as HDAC inhibitors or energy substances. To activate NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy, Caco-2 cells were treated with LPS+ATP and rapamycin respectively without or with SCFAs. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and paracellular permeability were respectively detected with a Millicell-ERS voltohmmeter and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were applied to analyze the expression and distribution of  proteins, and the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy. (0.5mM), propionate(0.01mM) and butyrate (0.01mM) alone or in combination significantly increased TER, and stimulated the formation of . SCFAs also dramatically attenuated the LPS-induced TER reduction and paracellular permeability increase, accompanying significantly alleviated morphological disruption of ZO-1 and occludin. Meanwhile, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy induced by LPS were significantly inhibited by SCFAs. Trichostatin A imitated the inhibiting action of SCFAs on NLRP3 inflammasome, whereas etomoxir blocked the action of SCFAs on protecting intestinal barrier and inhibiting autophagy. In addition, the activation of autophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome by rapamycin and LPS+ATP resulted in TER reduction, paracellular permeability increase and morphological disruption of both ZO-1 and occludin, which was alleviated by SCFAs.It is suggested that SCFAs stimulate the formation of intestinal barrier, and protect the intestinal barrier from the disruption of LPS through inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy. In addition, SCFAs act as energy substances to protect intestinal barrier and inhibit autophagy, but act as HDAC inhibitors to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, the mutual promoting action between NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy would destroy intestinal barrier function, which could be alleviated by SCFAs.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

CeD is one of the most common autoimmune disorders affecting around 1% of the population worldwide. Currently, the only acceptable treatment for CeD is strict, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) which can often present a challenging task. A GFD alone is not sufficient to control symptoms and prevent mucosal damage that can result from unintentional gluten exposure. Moreover, long-term complications can occur in many patients. Consequently, there is an unmet need for non-dietary therapies for the management of CeD. Such therapies could serve as an adjunct to the GFD but eventually may replace it. This review will focus on and discuss non-dietary therapies currently in clinical development for the management of CeD. METHODOLOGY: We searched clinicaltrials.gov and PubMed to extract articles about celiac disease. We used keywords including, but not limited to, "celiac disease," "non-dietary," "therapeutics," "pathophysiology," "Endopeptidases," " modulators," "vaccine," and "Nexvax2". We focused mainly on articles that conducted pathophysiologic and therapeutic research in human trials.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Dysregulation of claudin 1 has been shown to induce epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, activation of the ERK signaling pathway by protein kinase C (PKC) was shown to be necessary for EMT induction. Whether PKC is involved in regulating breast cancer progression has not been addressed. The PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA) was used to investigate the effect of PKC activity on claudin 1 transcription and protein levels, subcellular distribution, and alterations in EMT markers in human breast cancer (HBC) cell lines. As well, tissue microarray analysis (TMA) of a large cohort of invasive HBC biopsies was conducted to investigate correlations between claudin 1 and PKC isomers. TPA upregulated claudin 1 levels in all HBC cell lines analyzed. In particular, a high induction of claudin 1 protein was observed in the MCF7 cell line. TPA treatment also led to an accumulation of claudin 1 in the cytoplasm. Additionally, we demonstrated that the upregulation of claudin 1 was through the ERK signaling pathway. In patient biopsies, we identified a significant positive correlation between claudin 1, PKCα, and PKCε in ER+ tumors. A similar correlation between claudin 1 and PKCε was identified in ER- tumors, and high PKCε was associated with shorter disease-free survival. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that claudin 1 and the ERK signaling pathway are important players in HBC progression.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not known. Therefore, we studied the influence of HOE642 on the barrier function of the epithelial cell line CaCo2. The phorbolester phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) was used to induce hyperpermeability of the epithelial layer which was indirectly determined by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Confocal laser scan microscopy (LSM) served to analyze the intracellular localization of adherens and  molecules. In five independent experiments we found that HOE642 increased TER in non-treated CaCo2 cells (control: 350 +/- 28 Omega/cm2; HOE642: 444 +/- 53 Omega/cm2) and prevented PMA-induced barrier dysfunction (PMA: 33 +/- 12 Omega/cm2; PMA plus HOE642: 496 +/- 47 Omega/cm2). LSM showed that HOE642 prevented the PMA-induced disassociation of the zonula adherens molecule beta-catenin from the cell membrane and the decreased expression of the zonula occludens molecule ZO-1. From our data we conclude that HOE642 may prevent stress-induced epithelial dysfunction by stabilization of cell membrane-associated  molecules.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31157194>Evolving Therapy for Celiac Disease.</a></h2><p>Gluten is known to be the main triggering factor for celiac disease (CeD), an immune-mediated disorder. CeD is therefore managed using a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), the only effective treatment available currently. However, the GFD is restrictive. Hence, efforts are being made to explore alternative therapies. Based on their mechanisms of action on various molecular targets involved in the pathogenesis of CeD, these therapies may be classified into one of the following five broad approaches. The first approach focuses on decreasing the immunogenic content of gluten, using strategies like genetically modified wheat, intra-intestinal gluten digestion using glutenases, microwave thermal treatment of hydrated wheat kernels, and gluten pretreatment with either bacterial/ fungal derived endopeptidases or microbial transglutaminase. The second approach involves sequestering gluten in the gut lumen before it is digested into immunogenic peptides and absorbed, using binder drugs like polymer p(HEMA-co-SS), single chain fragment variable (scFv), and anti- gluten antibody AGY. The third approach aims to prevent uptake of digested gluten through intestinal epithelial tight junctions, using a zonulin antagonist. The fourth approach involves tissue transglutaminase (tTG) inhibitors to prevent the enhancement of immunogenicity of digested gluten by the intestinal tTG enzyme. The fifth approach seeks to prevent downstream immune activation after uptake of gluten immunogenic peptides through the intestinal mucosal epithelial layer. Examples include HLA-DQ2 blockers that prevent presentation of gluten derived- antigens by dendritic cells to T cells, immune- tolerizing therapies like the vaccine Nexvax2 and TIMP-Glia, cathepsin inhibitors, immunosuppressants like corticosteroids, azathioprine etc., and anti-cytokine agents targeting TNF-α and interleukin-15. Apart from these approaches, research is being done to evaluate the effectiveness of probiotics/prebiotics, helminth therapy using , low FODMAP diet, and pancreatic enzyme supplementation in CeD symptom control; however, the mechanisms by which they play a beneficial role in CeD are yet to be clearly established. Overall, although many therapies being explored are still in the pre-clinical phase, some like the zonulin antagonist, immune tolerizing therapies and glutenases have reached phase II/III clinical trials. While these potential options appear exciting, currently they may at best be used to supplement rather than supplant the GFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25780093>Strengthening of the intestinal epithelial tight junction by Bifidobacterium bifidum.</a></h2><p>Epithelial  dysfunction has been implicated as one of the major contributors to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The increase in intestinal permeability allows the translocation of luminal antigens across the intestinal epithelium, leading to the exacerbation of colitis. Thus, therapies targeted at specifically restoring tight junction   are thought to have great potential as an alternative or supplement to immunology-based therapies. In this study, we screened Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus species for beneficial microbes to strengthen the intestinal epithelial , using the human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-2) in an in vitro assay. Some Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species prevented epithelial  disruption induced by TNF-α, as assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Furthermore, live Bifidobacterium species promoted wound repair in Caco-2 cell monolayers treated with TNF-α for 48 h. Time course (1)H-NMR-based metabonomics of the culture supernatant revealed markedly enhanced production of  after 12 hours of coincubation of B. bifidum and Caco-2. An increase in TER was observed by the administration of  to TNF-α-treated Caco-2 monolayers. Interestingly, -induced TER-enhancing effect in the coculture of B. bifidum and Caco-2 cells depends on the differentiation stage of the intestinal epithelial cells. These results suggest that Bifidobacterium species enhance intestinal epithelial   via metabolites such as .© 2015 The Authors.

We found here that l-afadin, neurabin-II, ZO-1, and E-cadherin showed similar and different behavior during the formation and destruction of cell-cell AJ in MDCK cells. In MDCK cells, the accumulation of both l-afadin and E-cadherin, but not that of ZO-1, changed in parallel depending on Rac small G protein activity. Dissociation of MDCK cells by culturing the cells at 2 microM Ca2+ caused rapid endocytosis of E-cadherin, but not that of l-afadin or ZO-1. Addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13- to these dissociated cells formed a -like structure where ZO-1 and l-afadin, but not neurabin-II or E-cadherin, accumulated. We furthermore found that, in non-epithelial EL cells, which expressed E-cadherin and attached to each other, l-afadin, neurabin-II, ZO-1 and E-cadherin were all localized at AJ. In cadherin-deficient L cells, I-afadin was mainly localized at cell-cell contact sites, but ZO-1 was mainly localized at the tip area of cell processes. Neurabin-II did not accumulate at the plasma membrane area. Neither l-afadin nor neurabin-II significantly interacted with alpha-, beta-catenin, E-cadherin, ZO-1 or occludin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9688609>Overexpression of protein kinase C-delta increases  permeability in LLC-PK1 epithelia.</a></h2><p>The Ca2+-independent delta-isoform of protein kinase C (PKC-delta) was overexpressed in LLC-PK1 epithelia and placed under control of a tetracycline-responsive expression system. In the absence of tetracycline, the exogenous PKC-delta is expressed. Western immunoblots show that the overexpressed PKC-delta is found in the cytosolic, membrane-associated, and Triton-insoluble fractions. Overexpression of PKC-delta produced subconfluent and confluent epithelial morphologies similar to that observed on exposure of wild-type cells to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-. Transepithelial electrical resistance (RT) in cell sheets overexpressing PKC-delta was only 20% of that in cell sheets incubated in the presence of tetracycline, in which the amount of PKC-delta and RT were similar to those in LLC-PK1 parental cell sheets. Overexpression of PKC-delta also elicited a significant increase in transepithelial flux of D-[14C]mannitol and a radiolabeled 2 x 10(6)-molecular-weight dextran, suggesting with the RT decrease that overexpression increased paracellular,  junctional permeability. Electron microscopy showed that PKC-delta overexpression results in a multilayered cell sheet, the  of which are almost uniformly permeable to ruthenium red. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy indicates that overexpression of PKC-delta results in a more disorganized arrangement of  junctional strands. As with LLC-PK1 cell sheets treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-, the reduced RT, increased D-mannitol flux, and  junctional leakiness to ruthenium red that are seen with PKC-delta overexpression suggest the involvement of PKC-delta in regulation of  junctional permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8869884>Alterations in cell cholesterol content modulate Ca(2+)-induced  assembly by MDCK cells.</a></h2><p>Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), a measure of  (TJ) barrier function, develops more rapidly and reaches higher values after preincubation of MDCK cells for 24 h with 2 microM Lovastatin (lova), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. While this effect was attributed to a 30% fall in cholesterol (CH), possible effects of lova on the supply of prenyl group precursors could not be excluded. In the current study, strategies were devised to examine effects on TER of agents that simultaneously lower CH and increase the flux of intermediates through the CH biosynthetic pathway. Zaragozic acid, 20 microM, an inhibitor of squalene synthase known to increase the synthesis of isoprenoids and levels of prenylated proteins, lowered cell CH by 30% after 24 h, while accelerating development of TER in the same manner as lova. TER was also enhanced, despite a 23% increase in the rate of [3H] incorporation into CH, when total CH was reduced by 45% during a 2-h incubation with 2 mM methyl beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD), an agent that stimulates CH efflux from cells. The fact that the rate of TER development was diminished when cell CH content was elevated by incubation with a complex of CH and MBCD is further evidence that this sterol modulates development of the epithelial barrier. Cell associated CH derived from the complex was similar to endogenous CH with respect to its accessibility to cholesterol oxidase. Lova's effect on TER was diminished when 5 micrograms/mL of CH was added to the medium during the last 11 h of incubation with lova.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9563475>Protein kinase C activation increases transepithelial transport of biologically active insulin.</a></h2><p>Protein kinase C activation leads to  junctional leakiness and, consequently, to increased transepithelial (paracellular) solute flux across epithelial barriers. This leakiness is shown here to result in as much as a 20-fold increase in the transepithelial flux of insulin. Using an epithelial/fibroblast coculture model, this transepithelially transported insulin is shown to be biologically active. The 3T3 fibroblasts situated on one side of the epithelial barrier exhibited increased insulin binding and resulting DNA synthesis when the epithelial  were made leaky to insulin on the opposite side of the epithelial barrier. The dramatically enhanced permeability of macromolecules across epithelial cell layers undergoing protein kinase C activation may play a significant role in epithelial cancer, immunology, and drug delivery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30112382>Volatile Oil of  Inhibits Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease via the Gut-Liver Axis.</a></h2><p>The dried mature fruit of  has been historically used in China as food and in the auxiliary treatment of digestive system disorders. Numerous studies have shown that gastrointestinal function is closely related to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease via the "gut-liver" axis.The present study aimed to explore whether the mechanism underlying the regulation of lipid accumulation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may affect related disorders using the active ingredients in .Male Sprague-Dawley rats on a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce NAFLD were administered water extract of  (WEAV), volatile oil of  (VOAV), or bornyl . After treatment, serum and liver total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), free fatty acid (FFA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were measured. The regulatory role of  in the microecology of the intestines was assessed using the V4 region of the 16S rDNA sequencing. The expression of the intestinal  proteins occludin and ZO-1 was also measured. The influence of  on TLR4-mediated chronic low-grade inflammation was evaluated based on the concentrations of key proteins of the TLR4/NF-кB signaling pathway.  effectively inhibited endogenous lipid synthesis, reduced TG, TC, and FFA accumulation, regulated the expression of LDL-C, and decreased lipid accumulation in liver tissues. VOAV effectively regulated the intestinal microflora, improved chronic low-grade inflammation by promoting ZO-1 and occludin protein expressions, and inhibited the TLR4/NF-кB signaling pathway.The present study provides scientific basis for the potential application of  in NAFLD prevention and treatment. Additional chemical constituents other than bornyl  also contributed to the preventive effects of  on NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17535255>Involvement of integrin-induced activation of protein kinase C in the formation of adherens .</a></h2><p>In epithelial cells,  (TJs) and adherens  (AJs) form junctional complexes. At AJs, cadherins and nectins are the major cell-cell adhesion molecules. Nectins first form cell-cell adhesions and then recruit cadherins to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites to form AJs in coordination with the activation of integrin alpha(v)beta(3), followed by the formation of TJs. We previously demonstrated that when MDCK cells precultured at a low Ca(2+) concentration were treated with the protein kinase C (PKC) activator 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13- (TPA), incomplete AJs and a TJ-like structure were achieved. However, it remains unknown how PKC is activated and how it regulates the formation of cell-cell . When MDCK cells precultured at a low Ca(2+) concentration were treated with TPA, incomplete AJs were formed without the activation of integrin alpha(v)beta(3). Treatment of cells with TPA also enhanced the phosphorylation of FAK, which transmits the outside-in signal of integrin and plays a role in the nectin-induced formation of AJs. In addition, inhibition of PKC suppressed the formation of AJs. These results indicate that the activation of PKC functions downstream of integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and upstream of FAK, and is important for the nectin-induced formation of AJs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28134251>Low-dose acetaminophen induces early disruption of cell-cell tight junctions in human hepatic cells and mouse liver.</a></h2><p>Dysfunction of cell-cell tight junction (TJ) adhesions is a major feature in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Liver TJs preserve cellular polarity by delimiting functional bile-canalicular structures, forming the blood-biliary . In acetaminophen-hepatotoxicity, the mechanism by which tissue cohesion and polarity are affected remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that acetaminophen, even at low-dose, disrupts the  of TJ and cell-matrix adhesions, with indicators of cellular stress with liver injury in the human hepatic HepaRG cell line, and primary hepatocytes. In mouse liver, at human-equivalence (therapeutic) doses, dose-dependent loss of intercellular hepatic TJ-associated ZO-1 protein expression was evident with progressive clinical signs of liver injury. Temporal, dose-dependent and specific disruption of the TJ-associated ZO-1 and cytoskeletal-F-actin proteins, correlated with modulation of hepatic ultrastructure. Real-time impedance biosensing verified in vitro early, dose-dependent quantitative decreases in TJ and cell-substrate adhesions. Whereas treatment with NAPQI, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen, or the PKCα-activator and TJ-disruptor phorbol-12-myristate-13-, similarly reduced TJ , which may implicate oxidative stress and the PKC pathway in TJ destabilization. These findings are relevant to the clinical presentation of acetaminophen-hepatotoxicity and may inform future mechanistic studies to identify specific molecular targets and pathways that may be altered in acetaminophen-induced hepatic depolarization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17678893>Phosphorylation of claudin-4 by PKCepsilon regulates  barrier function in ovarian cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Claudin proteins belong to a large family of transmembrane proteins essential to the formation and maintenance of  (TJs). In ovarian cancer, TJ protein claudin-4 is frequently overexpressed and may have roles in survival and invasion, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its regulation are poorly understood. In this report, we show that claudin-4 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) at Thr189 and Ser194 in ovarian cancer cells and overexpression of a claudin-4 mutant protein mimicking the phosphorylated state results in the disruption of the barrier function. Furthermore, upon phorbol ester-mediated PKC activation of OVCA433 cells, TJ strength is decreased and claudin-4 localization is altered. Analyses using PKC inhibitors and siRNA suggest that PKCepsilon, an isoform typically expressed in ovarian cancer cells, may be important in the TPA-mediated claudin-4 phosphorylation and weakening of the TJs. Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies showed that claudin-4 and PKCepsilon are co-localized at the TJs in these cells. The modulation of claudin-4 activity by PKCepsilon may not only provide a mechanism for disrupting TJ function in ovarian cancer, but may also be important in the regulation of TJ function in normal epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9450479>Transepithelial paracellular leakiness induced by chronic phorbol ester exposure correlates with polyp-like foci and redistribution of protein kinase C-alpha.</a></h2><p>Although exposure of LLC-PK1 epithelial cell sheets to phorbol esters (TPA) causes a near immediate and total decrease of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), continuation of exposure for 3 to 4 days results in a tachyphylactic response as TER begins to return to control levels. Recovery of TER is maximal by 5 to 6 days, but reaches only 70 to 80% of control level. A reciprocal change in the transepithelial flux of D-mannitol indicates that the TER decrease is indicative of an increase in  permeability. Exposure of cell sheets to TPA for several days also results in the appearance of multilayered polyp-like foci (PLFs) across the otherwise one cell layer thick cell sheets. The pattern of penetration of the electron dense dye, ruthenium red, from the apical surface, across the  and into the lateral intercellular space indicates that the  of the cell sheet become uniformly leaky after acute exposure to TPA. However, when exposure is continued for several days, only the  of cells in the PLFs manifest leakiness. The decrease in TER following acute TPA exposure correlates with the translocation of protein kinase C-alpha (PKC alpha) into a membrane-associated compartment. With exposure of several days, only a trace of PKC alpha is visible by Western immunoblot, and this is in the membrane-associated compartment. Immunofluorescent microscopy indicates that the trace of PKC alpha seen in the Western immunoblots is ascribable distinctly to cells of the PLFs. Monolayer areas between PLFs show no discernible immunofluorescent signal. The data therefore indicate that  barrier function may be restored in certain areas by the down regulation of PKC alpha from the membrane-associated compartment. Failure to down regulate may result in the paracellular leakiness and abnormal cell architecture of the PLFs. Possible implications of this model for in vivo epithelial tumor promotion are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12112361>Glial induction of blood-brain barrier-like L-system amino acid transport in the ECV304 cell line.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by the presence of  complexes between brain endothelial cells that restrict paracellular permeability. As a consequence, a number of transport proteins are expressed on cerebral endothelial cells to facilitate the transport of nutrients into the brain. Although the modulation of barrier  properties by glial-conditioned medium and by second messengers is well established, little is known about the effects of these factors on carrier-mediated BBB transport processes. The ECV304 cell line shows an endothelial phenotype and can be induced to upregulate certain BBB features in the presence of glial factors. In the present study, we have examined the effect of conditioned medium derived from rat C6-glioma cells (C6CM) on the function of the L-system amino acid transporter in ECV304 cells, using L-leucine as the model substrate, and have determined whether the changes observed can be mimicked by modulating intracellular cAMP levels. ECV304 cells exposed to C6CM exhibited a significant increase in both the affinity of leucine transport and the diffusional constant (Michaelis-Menten), while the maximal transport capacity remained unchanged. Conversely, acute exposure to modulators of the PKA and PKC second messenger pathways was found to reduce significantly the maximal transport capacity and diffusion constants, while transport affinity remained unchanged. In both cases, the maximal flux of leucine was increased, indicating transport of greater efficiency. This study indicates that exposure of ECV304 cells to C6CM provides an influence inducing L-system transport properties characteristic of brain endothelial cells. Furthermore, it appears that L-system-mediated transport of amino acids can be modulated by several distinct pathways.Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6284631>Dendritic reticulum cell sarcoma?

In intestinal epithelial cells, MAGI-1/BAP1 was localized at , whereas SAP97/hDLG was localized diffusely at cell - cell . In Madine Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, MAGI-1/BAP1 was colocalized with ZO-1, whereas SAP97/hDLG was colocalized with E-cadherin. In MDCK cells, dominant active and negative mutants of Rac1 small G protein changed the amounts of SAP97/hDLG at cell - cell , but not that of MAGI-1/BAP1. When MDCK cells were switched to a low Ca2+ medium, E-cadherin disappeared from the plasma membrane, and cells were dissociated.

We noted a significant increase of lead level in capillaries and synaptosomes obtained from brains of rats under chronic toxicity conditions. Intravenously injected horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used to evaluate the functional state of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The results indicate that, systematically administered at low doses, lead induces BBB dysfunction. The changes, revealed in light microscopy and confirmed by electron microscopic studies, are typical for "leaky" microvessels, reported for variety of neuropathological conditions associated with BBB damage. Enhanced pinocytotic activity of the endothelial cells and the opening of interendothelial , together with enormous phagocytizing action of the pericytes, are the most characteristic ultrastructural features noted. The presence of specific type of perivascular cells containing droplets of lipids in the cytoplasm, together with changes in phospholipid profile in brain capillaries, suggest that altered lipid composition of membranes may, at least in part, be responsible for changes in observed membrane permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22401910>Larazotide  promotes  assembly in epithelial cells.</a></h2><p> (TJ) control paracellular permeability and apical-basolateral polarity of epithelial cells.

Here, we examined the effect of larazotide  on de novo TJ assembly using 2 different model systems. In MDCK cells, larazotide  promoted TJ assembly in a calcium switch assay. Larazotide  also promoted actin rearrangement, and junctional distribution of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, claudins, and E-cadherin. Larazotide  promoted TJ maturation and decreased paracellular permeability in "leaky" Caco-2 cells. Taken together, our data indicate that larazotide  enhances TJ assembly and barrier function by promoting actin rearrangement and redistribution of TJ and AJ proteins.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Pullulan  (PA) nanoparticles (NPs) are a promising nanocarrier derived from natural polysaccharide; however, their transplacental transport ability and mechanism are unknown.In this study, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated PA (PA-FITC) was synthesized. PA-FITC NPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cytotoxicity of PA-FITC NPs at concentrations of 15, 30, 60, 125, 250, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 μg/mL was studied by cell counting kit-8. The human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) cytokine assay was conducted to evaluate the biological function of BeWo b30 cells. Endocytic mechanisms of PA-FITC NPs were investigated via fluorescence analysis. The monolayer properties were characterized by TEM,  staining, transepithelial electrical resistance and fluorescein sodium transportation. The transport ability was measured in the cell based transwell model by confocal imaging and SEM.PA-FITC NPs were almost spherical shape with a size range of 200-300 nm. Cell viability of BeWo b30 cells was up to 100% in all groups. The concentrations of HCG increased with increasing numbers of cells and culture time, which showed the good biological function of BeWo b30 cells. PA-FITC NPs were rapidly endocytosed through caveolae-mediated endocytosis and pinocytosis, with uptake inhibition rates with nystatin (NY) and colchicines (Col) of 55% and 51% respectively. BeWo b30 cell monolayer was formed over 5 days. PA-FITC NPs were found in the cytoplasm of cells on the transwell membranes; while some NPs were found in the basolateral (fetal) compartment over 24 h.In summary, PA-FITC NPs are nontoxic, can cross the blood-placental barrier, and show mainly internalization to BeWo b30 cells through caveolae-mediated endocytosis and pinocytosis pathways, major via the former pathway. The results could benefit the adjustment and control of the transplacental transport of nanomedicines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7688317>Effects of epidermal growth factor versus phorbol ester on kidney epithelial (LLC-PK1)  permeability and cell division.</a></h2><p>In polarized epithelia, the  (TJs) constitute a barrier that controls the paracellular flux of solutes and water. In the renal LLC-PK1 cells, the TJ permeability can be correlated directly with the unidirectional transepithelial flux of solutes, such as D-mannitol, which have negligible affinity for cell membrane transport systems, and inversely to the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). This study investigates TJ permeability and cell proliferation in LLC-PK1 cells treated with the phorbol ester, tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) or with epidermal growth factor (EGF), a mitogen without secondary carcinogenic effects. Both TPA and EGF induced mitogenesis in LLC-PK1 cells. The TJs in TPA-treated cells were leaky, as indicated by decreased TER, increased D-mannitol flux, and TJ penetration by ruthenium red. In contrast, EGF treatment did not result in a decrease in TER, only slightly increased the D-mannitol flux, and did not result in ruthenium red penetration of the TJs. This inability of ruthenium red to penetrate TJs between EGF-treated epithelial cells was true even for cells in mitosis. The data therefore indicate that mitogenesis per se does not increase TJ permeability, suggesting that the TJ leakiness observed during tumor promotion with phorbol esters does not arise from cell proliferation and is perhaps associated distinctly with or causal to the transformation of those cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23189932>Depot medroxyprogesterone  increases immune cell numbers and activation markers in human vaginal mucosal tissues.</a></h2><p>The relationship between exogenous contraceptive hormones and permissiveness of the female genital tract to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the subject of renewed debate. To better characterize the effect of depot medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA) on HIV-1 cellular targets and epithelial integrity in the vagina, we compared leukocyte populations, markers of activation and proliferation, and the density of intercellular junctional proteins in the vaginal epithelium of women during the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle and approximately 12 weeks after receiving a DMPA injection. This prospective cohort study involved 15 healthy women. Vaginal biopsies were obtained in the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, and approximately 12 weeks following a 150-mg intramuscular injection of DMPA. Leukocyte populations, activation phenotype, and epithelial  and adherens proteins were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. After receiving DMPA, the numbers of CD45, CD3, CD8, CD68, HLA-DR, and CCR5 bearing immune cells were significantly (p<0.05) increased in vaginal tissues, compared to the follicular and/or luteal phases of untreated cycles. There were no significant differences in immune cell populations between the follicular and luteal phases of the control cycle. There were also no statistically significant differences in epithelial thickness and density of epithelial  and adherens proteins among the follicular, luteal, and post-DMPA treatment sampling points. In this pilot study, vaginal immune cell populations were significantly altered by exogenous progesterone, resulting in increased numbers of T cells, macrophages, and HLA-DR- and CCR5-positive cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1324609>Cellular variability in the development of  after activation of protein kinase C.</a></h2><p>Phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) decreases the  conductance (TJC) during the reorganization of LLC-PK1A monolayers, but has the opposite effect in LLC-PK1B4, MDCK, and MDCK4 cells. Because no protein synthesis was required for the effects of PMA on the TJC of LLC-PK1A monolayers, we conclude that the regulation of the  by protein kinase C (PKC) is a posttranslational event. In LLC-PK1A monolayers with existing , PMA produced an initial increase in the TJC that reverted later to control values despite the continuous presence of PMA and cycloheximide. The inhibitory effect of PMA on the other cell lines was not revertible. A downregulation of total PKC activity and phorbol ester receptors was only observed during the reorganization of LLC-PK1A monolayers. PMA further increases this downregulation. This indicates that the peculiar response to PMA observed in LLC-PK1A monolayers is the result of two concurrent events: 1) the early activation of the enzyme just before the reorganization of the  begin, and 2) its late downregulation induced after prolonged exposure to phorbol esters. We conclude that PKC regulates the development of the occluding , but through different mechanisms dependent on the characteristics of the cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9143587>Ultrastructural study of brain microvessels in patients with traumatic cerebral contusions.</a></h2><p>Brain tissue from 11 patients with traumatic cerebral contusions submitted to surgery was studied. Control biopsy specimens were obtained from 5 patients undergoing ventriculo-peritoneal shunts for "communicating" hydrocephalus. After collection, the small fragments were fixed by immersion in glutaraldehyde-osmium and embedded in Epon. Semi-thin sections stained with toluidine blue were observed with the light microscope. Thin sections stained with lead citrate and uranyl  were observed using a Jeol electron microscope. In tissues from patients with head trauma a clear space most probably corresponding to fluid accumulation was systematically observed around microvessels. Ultrastructurally endothelial cells from these specimens exhibited signs of marked intracellular oedema,  being intact. Pinocytotic activity was increased, mainly at the abluminal surface. Swelling of astrocytic perivascular processes and the appearance of macrophagic cells with voluminous lysosomes were also observed. The authors conclude that the oedema of endothelial cells probably represent a central fact in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain oedema and speculate on the putative involvement of stretch-activated receptors in this condition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22731715>Microbial butyrate and its role for barrier function in the gastrointestinal tract.</a></h2><p>Butyrate production in the large intestine and ruminant forestomach depends on bacterial butyryl-CoA/-CoA transferase activity and is highest when fermentable fiber and nonstructural carbohydrates are balanced. Gastrointestinal epithelia seem to use butyrate and butyrate-induced endocrine signals to adapt proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation to the growth of the bacterial community. Butyrate has a potential clinical application in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; ulcerative colitis). Via inhibited release of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 13 and inhibition of histone deacetylase, butyrate may contribute to the restoration of the  barrier in IBD by affecting the expression of claudin-2, occludin, cingulin, and zonula occludens poteins (ZO-1, ZO-2). Further evaluation of the molecular events that link butyrate to an improved  structure will allow for the elucidation of the cofactors affecting the reliability of butyrate as a clinical treatment tool.© 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27564600>All-Trans Retinoic Acid Inhibits Human Colorectal Cancer Cells RKO Migration via Downregulating Myosin Light Chain Kinase Expression through MAPK Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) inhibits the invasive and metastatic potentials of various cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ATRA inhibited colorectal cancer cells RKO (human colon adenocarcinoma cell) migration by downregulating cell movement and increasing cell adhesion. ATRA inhibited the expression and activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in RKO cells, while the expression level of MLC phosphatase (MLCP) had no change in RKO cells treated with or without ATRA. The expression and activity of MLC was also inhibited in RKO cells exposed to ATRA. Intriguingly, ATRA increased the expression of occludin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein and its localization on cell membrane. However, ATRA did not change the expression of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), but increased the accumulation of ZO-1 on RKO cells membrane. ML-7, an inhibitor of MLCK, significantly inhibited RKO cell migration. Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous MLCK expression inhibited RKO migration. Mechanistically, we showed that MAPK-specific inhibitor PD98059 enhanced the inhibitory effect of ATRA on RKO migration. In contrast, phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) attenuated the effects of ATRA in RKO cells. Moreover, knocking down endogenous extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) expression inhibited MLCK expression in the RKO cells. In conclusion, ATRA inhibits RKO migration by reducing MLCK expression via extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/Mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/MAPK) signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27729974>Acetylsalicylic acid supplementation improves protein utilization efficiency while vitamin E supplementation reduces markers of the inflammatory response in weaned pigs challenged with enterotoxigenic .</a></h2><p>This experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that vitamin E (Vit E) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, will additively reduce the production of the immunosuppressive molecule prostaglandin E (PGE) and hence reduce inflammatory responses in weaner pigs experimentally infected with an enterotoxigenic strain of .The experiment was conducted in a research facility with 192 individually-housed male weaner pigs (Landrace × Large White) weighing 6.6 ± 0.04 kg (mean ± SEM).

The FGT is composed of upper and lower parts, distinct in their morphological and functional characteristics. Co-factors in the genital microenvironment, such as presence of hormones, semen, and other sexually transmitted infections, can facilitate or deter HIV infection and play a critical role in determining susceptibility to HIV. In this review, we examine some of these co-factors and their potential influence. Presence of physical and chemical barriers such as epithelial tight junctions, mucus, and anti-microbial peptides can actively block and inhibit viral replication, presenting a significant deterrent to HIV. Upon exposure, HIV and other pathogens first encounter the genital epithelium: cells that express a wide repertoire of pattern recognition receptors that can recognize and directly initiate innate immune responses. These and other interactions in the genital tract can lead to direct and indirect inflammation and enhance the number of local target cells, immune activation, and microbial translocation, all of which promote HIV infection and replication. Better understanding of the dynamics of HIV transmission in the female genital tract would be invaluable for improving the design of prophylactic strategies against HIV.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

It is formed by endothelial cells with special characteristics, which confer the BBB with low permeability and high transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). We previously demonstrated that malathion and lead, two neurotoxicants widely present in the environment, decrease TEER and increase permeability in in vitro models of the BBB. In this study we assessed  disruption at the protein and gene expression levels using a rat brain microvascular endothelial cell line (RBE4) exposed to lead  at 10(-5)M and 10(-6)M, malathion at 10(-5)M, malaoxon at 10(-6)M, and their combinations. Cells were incubated with treatments for 2h, 4h, 8h, 16h, and 24h periods. Immunoblotting assessments demonstrated that protein levels of  proteins occludin and claudin 5, and scaffold proteins ZO1 and ZO2 were decreased after treatments. Gene expression determinations did not correlate with the decreases in protein, indicating that the effects on these proteins were post-translational.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Ethanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH), catalase or cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) to acetaldehyde, which is then further oxidized to  by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Acetaldehyde has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a Group 1 carcinogen to humans. The acetaldehyde level in the stomach and colon is locally influenced by gastric colonization by  or colonic microbes, as well as polymorphisms in the genes encoding tissue alcohol metabolizing enzymes, especially ALDH2. Alcohol stimulates the uptake of carcinogens and their metabolism and also changes the composition of enteric microbes in a way to enhance the aldehyde level. Alcohol also undergoes chemical coupling to membrane phospholipids and disrupts organization of , leading to nuclear translocation of β-catenin and ZONAB, which may contributes to regulation of genes involved in proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Alcohol also generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) by suppressing the expression of antioxidant and cytoprotective enzymes and inducing expression of CYP2E1 which contribute to the metabolic activation of chemical carcinogens. Besides exerting genotoxic effects by directly damaging DNA, ROS can activates signaling molecules involved in inflammation, metastasis and angiogenesis. In addition, alcohol consumption induces folate deficiency, which may result in aberrant DNA methylation profiles, thereby influencing cancer-related gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7775116>Freeze-fracture studies of interendothelial  in the angle of the human eye.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine the structure and complexity of the intercellular  between trabecular endothelial cells and Schlemm's canal endothelial (SCE) cells as they exist in the normal human eye. Despite the probable relevance of these  to aqueous outflow, examination of these  has been limited to monkey eyes.Human eyes (< 24 hours after death) were fixed by immersion in modified Karnovsky's fluid. Radially oriented tissue-chopper sections (190 microns) were trimmed to contain only the trabecular meshwork, Schlemm's canal, and a narrow strip of the sclera. Specimens were processed for conventional electron microscopy and freeze-fracture. Replicas were produced in a freeze-fracture apparatus operated at -115 degrees C and 10(-7) torr. Thin sections were stained with uranyl  and lead citrate. Micrographs were taken on a transmission electron microscope.The trabecular endothelial cells were joined by gap  and short discontinuous junctional strands that partitioned predominantly with P-face. The strand pattern varied from short and isolated undulating strands to radiating arrays of short junctional strands. No continuous zonulae occludentes were observed. The SCE cells were joined by continuous  (tj) composed of discontinuous strands that rarely branched or anastomosed. The tj strands fractured preferentially with the E-face, where they were positioned at the bases of shallow valleys. On the P-face, a complementary system of shallow ridges was observed with few particles at their crests. Often, only a single continuous strand was present for long distances, with occasional short discontinuous strands running parallel to the single strand. Less often, short lengths of remarkably complex , which occasionally branched or anastomosed, were also encountered. When more than one strand was present, numerous free endings and transjunctional pathways, described in monkey eyes as "slit-pores," were evident.The overall structure of the  between endothelial cells of Schlemm's canal in the human eye was more complex, and thus less permeable, than that reported in the monkey eye. The role of slit-pores and other  of SCE and trabecular endothelial cells will require further investigation under conditions of flow and in glaucoma to determine if these  change in a manner that might influence outflow resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15975492>Short-chain fatty acids alter  permeability in intestinal monolayer cells via lipoxygenase activation.</a></h2><p>Involvement of lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclo-oxygenase (COX) on cellular differentiation or apoptosis induced by butyrate has been reported recently, but the effect on  (TJ) permeability has not been reported. One major activity of butyrate and, to a lesser extent, propionate is to modulate gene transcription via histone acetylation by their histone deacetylase inhibitor activity. In this study, we evaluated the activation of LOX and COX in TJ permeability changes by short-chain fatty acids, butyrate, propionate, and  in intestinal monolayer cells and their possible mechanism by histone acetylation.The effects of LOX and COX inhibitors on TJ permeability and the expression of LOX or COX mRNA induced by short-chain fatty acids were investigated in Caco-2 cells using Transwell chambers. The effects of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (a product of LOX) on TJ permeability were also evaluated. The effects of short-chain fatty acids were compared with those of trichostatin A (histone deacetylase inhibitor).A LOX inhibitor clearly inhibited the effect of butyrate on TJ permeability, whereas COX inhibitors did not. The LOX and COX inhibitors partly inhibited the effects of propionate but not of . Butyrate increased LOX mRNA expression, and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and trichostatin A mimicked its effect.These results suggest that short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, induce TJ permeability changes through LOX activation through histone acetylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20533305>c-Jun N-terminal kinase is largely involved in the regulation of tricellular  via tricellulin in human pancreatic duct epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Tricellulin (TRIC) is a  protein at tricellular contacts where three epithelial cells meet, and it is required for the maintenance of the epithelial barrier. To investigate whether TRIC is regulated via a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, human pancreatic HPAC cells, highly expressed at tricellular contacts, were exposed to various stimuli such as the JNK activators anisomycin and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA), and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-1α. TRIC expression and the barrier function were moderated by treatment with the JNK activator anisomycin, and suppressed not only by inhibitors of JNK and PKC but also by siRNAs of TRIC. TRIC expression was induced by treatment with the PKC activator TPA and proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-1α, whereas the changes were inhibited by a JNK inhibitor. Furthermore, in normal human pancreatic duct epithelial cells using hTERT-transfected primary cultured cells, the responses of TRIC expression to the various stimuli were similar to those in HPAC cells. TRIC expression in tricellular  is strongly regulated together with the barrier function via the JNK transduction pathway. These findings suggest that JNK may be involved in the regulation of tricellular  including TRIC expression and the barrier function during normal remodeling of epithelial cells, and prevent disruption of the epithelial barrier in inflammation and other disorders in pancreatic duct epithelial cells.© 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2418946>Ovarian endodermal sinus tumor with intestinal differentiation.</a></h2><p>A 12-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of an abdominal mass.

A study of long-term exposure of immortalized bovine retinal endothelial cells (iBRECs) to VEGF(165) clearly confirmed the role of the  protein claudin-1, which almost completely disappeared within 24 hours, an effect that was completely reversed by addition of the VEGF-binding Fab fragment ranibizumab. This study was conducted to investigate whether the VEGF(165)-induced loss of claudin-1 is regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) and indeed affects the barrier function of iBRECs.The effects of various PKC inhibitors on claudin-1 expression and cellular localization in iBRECs treated with VEGF(165) for up to 2 days were studied by Western blot analyses and immunofluorescence microscopy. The permeability of the cell layers was determined by transendothelial electrical resistance measurements.Activation of PKC led to decreased expression of claudin-1, which was blocked by inhibitors of PKCdelta. However, none of the PKC inhibitors significantly affected VEGF(165)-induced effects on cellular localization or expression of claudin-1. Also VEGF(165)-induced higher permeability of iBREC layers could be reversed or prevented by ranibizumab but not by PKC inhibitors. In addition, low claudin-1 expression and its delocalization from the plasma membrane were significantly associated with elevated permeability.In iBRECs, PKC isoforms are not crucially involved in the VEGF(165)-initiated signal transduction that affects permeability and expression of claudin-1. This finding is in contrast to published results concerning only short-term effects of VEGF(165).

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of such modifications on small intestinal and colonic mucosa, two segments with different transit time and physiological functions. Rats were fed with either normal protein (NP; 14% protein) or HP (53% protein) isocaloric diet for 2 weeks, and parameters related to intestinal mucous-secreting cells and to several innate/adaptive immune characteristics (myeloperoxidase activity, cytokine and epithelial TLR expression, proportion of immune cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues) were measured in the ileum and colon. In ileum from HP animals, we observed hyperplasia of mucus-producing cells concomitant with an increased expression of Muc2 at both gene and protein levels, reduction of mucosal myeloperoxidase activity, down-regulation of Tlr4 gene expression in enterocytes and down-regulation of mucosal Th cytokines associated with CD4+ lymphocyte reduction in mesenteric lymph nodes. These changes coincided with an increased amount of  in the ileal luminal content. In colon, HP diet ingestion resulted in a lower number of goblet cells at the epithelial surface but increased goblet cell number in colonic crypts together with an increased Muc3 and a slight reduction of Il-6 gene expression. Our data suggest that HP diet modifies the goblet cell distribution in colon and, in ileum, increases goblet cell activity and decreases parameters related to basal gut inflammatory status. The impact of HP diet on intestinal mucosa in terms of beneficial or deleterious effects is discussed.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Of 512 potential proteins, >90% were unchanged in expression. Noteworthy was the up-regulation of several -related proteins, including MUPP1 (multi-PDZ protein-1), ZO1 (zonula occludens 1), and Af6. The most robustly up-regulated protein under hypertonic conditions was MUPP1 (7.2x, P < 0.001). Changes in expression for MUPP1 were verified by quantitative PCR for message and Western blot for protein. In mouse kidney tissues, MUPP1 expression was substantial in the papilla and was absent in the cortex. Furthermore, MUPP1 expression increased 253% (P < 0.01) in the papilla upon 36 h of thirsting. Localization of MUPP1 protein expression was confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis demonstrating only minor staining under isotonic conditions and the substantial presence in chronically adapted cells at the basolateral membrane. Message and protein half-life in IMCD3 cells were 26.2 and 17.8 h, respectively. Osmotic initiators of MUPP1 expression included NaCl, sucrose, mannitol, sodium , and choline chloride but not urea. Stable IMCD3 clones silenced for MUPP1 expression used the pSM2-MUPP1 vector. In cell viability experiments, clones silenced for MUPP1 demonstrated only a minor loss in cell survival under acute sublethal osmotic stress compared with empty vector control cells. In contrast, a 24% loss (P < 0.02) in transepithelial resistance for monolayers of MUPP1-silenced cells was determined as compared with controls.

Intriguingly, we discovered cross-talk between podosomes and TJs in human brain endothelial cells. Tight junction scaffold proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2 localize at podosomes in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13- treatment. We found that both ZO proteins are essential for podosome formation and function. Rather than being derived from new protein synthesis, podosomal ZO-1 and ZO-2 are relocated from a pre-existing pool found at the peripheral plasma membrane with enhanced physical interaction with cortactin, a known protein marker for podosomes. Sequestration of ZO proteins in podosomes weakens tight junction complex formation, leading to increased endothelial cell permeability. This effect can be further attenuated by podosome inhibitor PP2. Altogether, our data revealed a novel cellular function of podosomes, specifically, their ability to negatively regulate tight junction and endothelial  , which have been linked to a variety of cerebrovascular diseases.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17235143>Short communication: Ability of cultured mammary epithelial cells in a bicameral system to secrete milk fat.</a></h2><p>Mammary epithelial cells from lactating cows were cultured onto inserts coated with type I collagen. Every second day, the rates of fatty acid synthesis and secretion were determined by measuring the amount of [14C]-labeled sodium  incorporated into lipids over a 4-h period. The [14C]-containing lipids were identified by thin layer chromatography fractionation. In parallel, the integrity of the cell layer was evaluated by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance. The integrity increased progressively to reach a maximum after 8 d of culture. Cells incorporated  into lipids; 1.34% of  was incorporated into lipids produced by freshly isolated cells. This percentage decreased to 0.5% after 2 d of culture. Moreover, this capacity decreased with the duration in culture; on d 8, the rate of incorporation dropped to about 3% of that on d 2. In the cell extracts, the [14C]-labeled lipids were mainly triglycerides, although the proportion of diglycerides and phospholipids progressively increased as a part of total newly synthesized lipids. The proportion of triglycerides decreased 0.66 times between d 2 and 8 when the proportion of diglycerides and phospholipids increased 1.33 and 2.18 times, respectively. About 28% of the newly synthesized lipids were secreted within 4 h of incubation. Around 65 to 85% of these labeled lipids were found in the apical compartment, suggesting a partially vectorial secretion. But 58 to 80% of labeled lipids found in the apical and basolateral medium were free fatty acids. Functional  and incorporation of labeled fatty acids into triglycerides are not compatible with an inferred status of complete dedifferentiation of the cell layer. Moreover, triglyceride secretion seems compromised, probably due to the lack of an appropriate cell environment and cell shape.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27646195>Bottom up design of nanoparticles for anti-cancer diapeutics: "put the drug in the cancer's food".</a></h2><p>The story starts in Basel at CLINAM in 2013, when I asked Pieter about making nanoparticles and he advised me to "try this solvent-exchange method we have developed for making limit sized particles". We are particularly interested in what are "limit size materials" because we want to test the feasibility of an idea: could we design, make, develop, and test the concept for treating metastatic cancer by, "Putting the Drug in the Cancer's Food? "Limit size" is the size of the cancer's food, ? the common Low Density Lipoprotein, (LDL) ~20 nm diameter. In this contribution to Pieter's LTAA we focus on the "bottom" (nucleation) and the "up" (growth) of "bottom-up design" as it applies to homogeneous nucleation of especially, hydrophobic drugs and the 8 physico-chemical stages and associated parameters that determine the initial size, and any subsequent coarsening, of a nanoparticle suspension. We show that, when made by the rapid solvent-exchange method, the same sized particles can be obtained without phospholipid. Furthermore, the obtained size follows the predictions of classic nucleation theory when the appropriate values for the parameters (surface tension and supersaturation) at nucleation are included. Calculations on dissolution time for nanoparticles reveal that a typical fewmicromolar-solubility, hydrophobic, anti-cancer drug (like Lapatinib, Niclosamide, Abiraterone, and Fulvestrant) of 500 nm diameter would take between 3?7 s to dissolve in an infinite sink like the blood stream; and a 50 nm particle would dissolve in less than a second! And so the nanoparticle design requires a highly water-insoluble drug, and a tight, encapsulating, impermeable lipid:cholesterol monolayer. While the "Y" junction can be used to mix an ethanolic solution with anti-solvent, we find that a "no-junction" can give equally good results. A series of nanoparticles (DiI-fluorescently labeled Triolein-cored and drug-cored nanoparticles of Orlistat) were then tested in well-characterized cell lines for uptake and efficacy as well as a PET-imageable nanoparticle in initial PET-imaging studies in animals for EPR uptake and tumor detection. We show that, while free-drug cannot be optimally administered in vivo, a nanoparticle formulation of orlistat could in principle represent a stable parenteral delivery system. The article ends with a brief discussion of what we see as the way forward in Individualized Medicine from the Diagnostic-Therapeutic ("Diapeutic") side, requiring FDG detection of metastatic lesions, functional imaging of a protein target (e.g. Fatty Acid Synthase) using C , then a PET (or other)-imageable nanoparticle to demonstrate EPR accumulation, and then the administration of the pure-drug nanoparticle taken in by the most aggressive cancer cells in the perivascular space, as they would their "food".</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8141294>Reversible disassembly of an intestinal epithelial monolayer by prolonged exposure to phorbol ester.</a></h2><p>This article describes a model of reversible disassembly of a cultured human intestinal epithelial monolayer by prolonged exposure to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA). Prolonged phorbol ester exposure reduces protein kinase C (PKC) levels in numerous cell types including T84, as shown here. Under PKC-downregulated conditions, T84 monolayers, which simulate the highly organized structure of native intestinal crypt cells, become disassembled into 2 or 3 layers of rounded cells. Proliferation does not account for these morphological changes as assessed by thymidine incorporation studies. The effects of structural disorganization on epithelial barrier function was also examined. The permeability of disassembled monolayers was significantly greater than that of controls. Flux studies localized the permeability defect to the . PKC-associated alterations in the perijunctional ring of actin and myosin, one of the putative regulators of flow across the , were found to correlate with the observed functional changes. Most interesting was the fact that monolayer reassembly to the original columnar epithelial phenotype and reestablishment of barrier function occurred upon normalization of PKC levels. This model of reversible monolayer disassembly will allow investigation into the relationship between epithelial structure and function and examination of factors that govern monolayer formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14667834>Activation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway induces  disruption in human corneal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by exposure of cultured human corneal epithelial cells to phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) resulted in an increase in paracellular permeability as evidenced by a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). A change in the membrane distribution of the  protein ZO-1 was also observed in the PMA-treated cells. In contrast, when the cells were treated with PMA in the presence of PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase, all barrier characteristics were preserved, suggesting that PKC induces  disruption through the activation of MAPK. The role of this signaling pathway in the regulation of epithelial permeability was further elucidated by the use of corneal epithelial-derived cell lines expressing constitutively activated (ca) or dominant-negative (dn) mutants of MAPK kinase-1 (MEK1). Transfectants of caMEK1, when compared to parental cells, had higher levels of phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), altered distribution of ZO-1 and occludin, and much reduced TER. On the other hand, dnMEK1 transfectants had lower but detectable levels of ERK phosphorylation, more flattened morphology, and, most importantly, significantly higher TER when compared to parental cells. Our study demonstrates that activation of PKC causes the disruption of  through activation of MAP kinase and that the MAP kinase signaling pathway plays a key role in the regulation of epithelial cell morphology and barrier function in the cornea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22153524>Non-dietary therapeutic clinical trials in coeliac disease.</a></h2><p>Coeliac disease is a permanent immunological intolerance to gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. The only management is life-long strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. Unfortunately, compliance with gluten-free diet is very difficult in practice due to the widespread presence of gluten in Western diets. For this reason, about 50% of coeliacs following a gluten-free diet continue to suffer from symptoms and present with autoantibodies and/or villous atrophy while on a gluten-free diet. It is therefore important to explore new therapies to improve the management of coeliac disease. To date, five experimental therapies have been tested in randomized and controlled clinical trials. Larazotide  reduces the para-cellular passage of gluten to the lamina propria by preventing the opening of intercellular . The endopeptidases ALV003 and AN-PEP break down gluten to produce less or non-toxic peptide fragments. A therapeutic vaccine is being tested with the aim of developing gluten tolerance. Finally, infection with the nematode Necator americanus and treatment with the CCR9 antagonist Traficet-EN have also been reported. While substantial progress has been made in the last few years, it is important to remember that all these investigational therapies are in research stage and are generally being considered as "adjunctive" therapies to the gluten-free diet and not as substitutes of the gluten-free diet at this point in time.Copyright © 2011 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

We analyzed the influence of the bacteria on transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) on a model  epithelium, T84, grown to confluence in permeable filters. H. pylori sonicates produced a dramatic decrease in TER after 1 to 2 h of exposure, while sonicates from other bacteria did not induce a significant reduction of TER. The effect induced by sonicates was mimicked by a water-soluble fraction from the bacterial surface, was not reproducible with isolated lipopolysaccharide, and was concomitant with a significant increase in the paracellular permeability of the marker molecule [14C]mannitol. Furthermore, H. pylori sonicates also provoked a significant increase in permeability to [14C]mannitol across rat gastric mucosa in vitro. The sonicate-induced decrease in TER in T84 monolayers was inhibited by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol myristate . As PKC is directly involved in  regulation, we suggest that H. pylori may induce intracellular signalling events counteracting PKC effects. Following long-term H. pylori stimulation, epithelial monolayers regained baseline resistance values slowly after 24 h. The resistance recovery process was inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating its dependency upon protein synthesis. No association between resistance variation and E-cadherin protein levels was observed. These results indicate that H. pylori alters in vitro the barrier properties of the epithelium, probably by generating cell signalling events counteracting the normal function of PKC. This increased permeability may provide a potential mechanism by which H. pylori antigens can reach the gastric lamina propria, thereby activating the mucosal immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10784122>Phorbol ester induced changes in  and adherens  in the choroid plexus epithelium and in the ependyma.</a></h2><p>The molecular composition and functional properties of cell-cell  of choroid plexus epithelial cells and the ependyma of the lateral ventricular wall were investigated in the rat brain. Expression studies of cadherin and alpha- and beta-catenins, as well as expression of occludin and ZO-1, indicated that cell adherens and  were present in both choroid plexus epithelial cells and in ependymal cells. We then tested the hypothesis that phorbolester in vivo can induce changes in the expression level of adherens and  molecules at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier as well as in the ependyma. In addition, the functional properties of the ependymal  were tested by injection of dextran 3000 into the striatum after phorbolester application. Twenty-four hours after phorbolester-injection into the lateral ventricle of the rat brain, the expression patterns of  and adherens  molecules were markedly changed in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. The adherens  proteins cadherin and beta-catenin were reduced in both the ependymal cells of the lateral ventricle and choroid plexus epithelial cells. In addition, the occludin-immunoreactivity of the choroid plexus epithelial cells was strongly reduced. However, the ZO-1 immunoreactivity was not affected by the phorbol ester-treatment and the alpha-catenin immunoreactivity was not changed. Furthermore, phorbol ester injection induced a reduction of the volume of intrastriatal injected biotinylated dextran (m.w. 3000), which is consistent with a modulatory influence of protein kinase C activation on the clearance capacity of the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30564756>Diet supplementation with an organic acids-based formulation affects gut microbiota and expression of gut barrier genes in broilers.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to study the effect of diet supplementation with an organic acids-based formulation (OABF) on luminal- and mucosa-associated bacteria, concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA), microbial glycolytic enzyme activity and expression of mucin 2 (), immunoglobulin A () and  protein, i.e., zonula occludens-1 (), zonula occludens-2 (), claudin-1 (), claudin-5 () and occludin (), genes at the ileal and cecal level. A 2 × 2 factorial design was used having OABF inclusion and avilamycin as main factors. Subsequently, 544 day-old male Cobb broilers were allocated in the following 4 treatments, each with 8 replicates: no additions (CON), 1 g OABF/kg diet (OA), 2.5 mg avilamycin/kg diet (AV) and combination of OA and AV (OAAV). The trial lasted for 42 days. In the ileum, OAAV resulted in lower mucosa-associated total bacteria levels (  = 0.028) compared with AV. In addition, ileal digesta levels of  subgroup were decreased by avilamycin (  = 0.045).

Compared with normotensive rats: (1) volume of the endothelial cell layer was increased in all hypertensive situations with the exception of the late group after aortic ligature; the increase was most marked early after aortic ligature and early and late after DOCA; (2) endothelial surface to volume ratio was markedly decreased early after aortic ligature and early and late after DOCA; the ratio of luminal, abluminal, and lateral to total endothelial surface remained unchanged in all hypertensive situations; (3) in all hypertensive situations the ratio of  to lateral membrane surface increased, whereas the ratio of gap  to lateral membrane surface showed no significant change; (4) in all hypertensive situations lateral endothelial plasma membranes contained, in addition to zonular and macular type , many small aggregates of intramembrane particles in the P face and particle-free grooves in the E face; these structures were particularly numerous early after aortic ligature and early and late after DOCA; (5) in all hypertensive situations (most early and late after DOCA and least after sodium-rich diet) gap  were irregularly shaped in contrast to those of normotensive animals. Our results suggest that : (1) different types of hypertension produced different degrees of hypertrophy of the endothelial cell layer ; (2) hypertension increases the ratio of  to lateral endothelial membrane surface; the presence of small aggregates of intramembrane particles (probably representing assembly and/or disassembly of ) in the lateral endothelial plasma membranes is responsible for this phenomenon; (3) hypertension does not change the ratio of gap  to lateral membrane surface but results in abnormal gap  morphology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25683116>Larazotide  for persistent symptoms of celiac disease despite a gluten-free diet: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Celiac disease (CeD) is a prevalent autoimmune condition. Recurrent signs and symptoms are common despite treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD), yet no approved or proven nondietary treatment is available.In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we assessed larazotide  0.5, 1, or 2 mg 3 times daily to relieve ongoing symptoms in 342 adults with CeD who had been on a GFD for 12 months or longer and maintained their current GFD during the study. The study included a 4-week placebo run-in, 12 weeks of treatment, and a 4-week placebo run-out phase. The primary end point was the difference in average on-treatment Celiac Disease Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale score.The primary end point was met with the 0.5-mg dose of larazotide , with fewer symptoms compared with placebo by modified intention to treat (n = 340) (analysis of covariance, P = .022; mixed model for repeated measures, P = .005). The 0.5-mg dose showed an effect on exploratory end points including a 26% decrease in celiac disease patient-reported outcome symptomatic days (P = .017), a 31% increase in improved symptom days (P = .034), a 50% or more reduction from baseline of the weekly average abdominal pain score for 6 or more of 12 weeks of treatment (P = .022), and a decrease in the nongastrointestinal symptoms of headache and tiredness (P = .010). The 1- and 2-mg doses were no different than placebo for any end point. Safety was comparable with placebo.Larazotide  0.5 mg reduced signs and symptoms in CeD patients on a GFD better than a GFD alone.

Gliadin peptides pass through the epithelial layers, either paracellularly or transcellularly, to launch a potent adaptive immune response in the lamina propria. This aberrant immune response leads to diverse gastrointestinal and extra-gastrointestinal symptoms. Currently, the only treatment for CD is a strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), which can be challenging. An early effect of gluten in CD is an increase in gut permeability. Larazotide , also known as AT-1001, is a synthetic peptide developed as a permeability regulator primarily targeting CD.

Using an in vitro model based on porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells (PCPEC), we investigated the influence of PKC activating phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) on barrier properties and analyzed mechanisms involved in the regulation of barrier tightness. Applied in concentrations of 5-25 nM, PMA induced a fast and lasting decrease of the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), which could be blocked by rottlerin, indicating the involvement of PKCdelta in signal transduction. The immediate impairment of barrier integrity was accompanied by dephosphorylation of occludin and formation of actin bundles. Moreover, in the presence of at least 25 nM PMA, changes of cell shape as well as discontinuities of  strands were observed, suggesting the disruption of cell-cell contacts. Exposure to PMA for 1-2 days additionally induced down-regulation of claudin-2 and up-regulation of barrier modulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, respectively.

In the present study the inhibitory effects of these growth-promoting factors on hormone synthesis were studied in thyroid follicles cultured in type-I collagen gel, and morphologic alteration by these factors was examined by light and electron microscopy (EM). Porcine open thyroid follicles obtained by treatment with 0.1% collagenase were embedded in collagen gel and cultured in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 6H (insulin, hydrocortisone, somatostatin, transferrin, glycyl-his-lys, and thyrotropin) + 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 1 week these open follicles developed to closed follicles, and the medium was changed to one containing 6H + 0.5% FBS + 0.1 microM sodium iodide (NaI). Some media were supplemented with either EGF, phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA), or all-trans RA.

In this report, we present results obtained using a fluorimetric microplate assay for quantitative measurements of OA-induced changes on F-actin pools in BE(2)-M17 cells. The proposed method shows important advantages over classical methods in terms of rapidity, sensitivity (less than 5000 cells per well) and reproducibility, thus providing a very useful tool for studying F-actin levels in living cells. Results obtained demonstrate a time- and dose-dependent decrease of F-actin pools (IC(50)=100 nM at 1 h) in OA-treated cells, which was partly counteracted by TPA, H89, forskolin, wortmannin, ionomycin and orthovanadate at early stages, but remained unaffected after 24 h of incubation. Cells exposed for 1 h to 1 nM OA showed a slight increase of F-actin pools (1.5-fold), which was blocked by genistein and lavendustin A, thus suggesting a role for tyrosine kinases-dependent pathways in OA-induced polymerization at low concentrations. These results suggest direct interactions of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases with actin-binding proteins in the regulation of actin polymerization, thus indicating that disruption of cytoskeletal structure may be a key mechanism of OA-induced diarrhea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1673354>Influence of PMA and a low extracellular Ca2+ concentration on the development of the Na(+)-dependent hexose carrier in LLC-PK1 cells.</a></h2><p>We have analyzed the development of Na(+)-dependent hexose transport during differentiation and during polarization of LLC-PK1, an established cell line with characteristics of the proximal tubule. When cell-cell contact was disturbed by a low extracellular Ca2+ concentration or by a phorbol myristate  (PMA) treatment, the development of Na(+)-dependent hexose transport was completely inhibited. The effect of PMA on the development of hexose transport could be uncoupled from its effect on the . The PMA concentration needed for the latter effect was approx. 10-fold higher than for the former. As the primary cause of the PMA effect, an influence on the cytoskeleton is suggested. In contrast to PMA, the concentration dependence of both phenomena on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration was almost the same. Moreover, the incorporation of hexose carriers in the plasma membrane could be induced by changing the extracellular CA2+ concentration from low to normal. We conclude that there is a relation between the formation of  and the development of the Na(+)-dependent hexose carrier, possibly because Ca(2+)-dependent cell adhesion molecules play a role in both phenomena. However, a direct relation between Ca(2+)-dependent elements of the  and the insertion of the hexose carrier can not be excluded.

In the present study, the involvement of the protein kinase C pathway in the regulation of the phosphorylation and cellular distribution of occludin has been investigated. Phorbol 12-myristate 13- and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol induced the rapid phosphorylation of occludin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells cultured in low extracellular calcium medium with a concomitant translocation of occludin to the regions of cell-cell contact. The extent of occludin phosphorylation as well as its incorporation into  induced by protein kinase C activators or calcium switch were markedly decreased by the protein kinase C inhibitor GF-109203X. In addition, in vitro experiments showed that the recombinant COOH-terminal domain of murine occludin could be phosphorylated by purified protein kinase C. Ser(338) of occludin was identified as an in vitro protein kinase C phosphorylation site using peptide mass fingerprint analysis and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectroscopy.

In this study, we determined whether the paracellular permeability of opossum kidney (OK) cells would resemble that of the in vivo proximal tubule epithelium.The parental and subclonal OK cells and, for comparison, LLC-PK1 cells were cultured on permeable Transwell supports. The apparent paracellular permeability coefficient (Papp) for the extracellular marker 3H-mannitol was determined.The Papp of OK cell sheets (12.17 x10-6 cm/sec) was remarkably close to the previously reported Papp of rat proximal tubules. The Papp of LLC-PK1 cells, another proximal tubule cell line, however, was approximately 20-fold lower than that of both OK cells and the in vivo proximal tubule. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-, a protein kinase C activator, enhanced the Papp of OK cell sheets. The characteristic response of paracellular permeability to Ca2+ switch was demonstrated in OK cell sheets. Slight variations of Papp among several OK subclones were observed. Basal to apical Papp was uniformly higher than apical to basal Papp, independent of cell subtype. This rectification was attenuated by inhibition of active transport.OK cell sheets cultured on Transwell supports possess a leaky paracellular pathway resembling that of the proximal tubule epithelium in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24144481>Lead exposure results in hearing loss and disruption of the cochlear blood-labyrinth  and the protective role of iron supplement.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to investigate the impact of lead (Pb(2+)) on the auditory system and its molecular mechanisms. Pb(AC)2 was administrated to male SD rats aged 21-22 d for 8 weeks at a dose of 300ppm. Male guinea pigs were also administrated with 50mg/kg Pb(AC)2 two times a week for 8 weeks.

Abnormal shapes and loss of OHCs were found in the cochlear basilar membrane following the Pb(2+) exposure. TEM study showed that the tight junctions between the endothelial cells and the border cells were lost and disrupted. Down-regulation of the occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-5 in the stria vascularis suggested that the increased permeability of the blood-labyrinth  may attribute to the Pb(2+)-induced decrease of TJPs' expression. Additionally, Fe(2+) supplement partly reversed the Pb(2+)-induced hearing loss and down-regulation of TJPs. Taken together, these data indicate that the disruption of blood-labyrinth  by down-regulating the expression of TJPs plays a role in the Pb(2+)-induced hearing loss, and Fe(2+) supplement protects the auditory system against Pb(2+)-induced toxicity and may have significant clinical implications.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Hecht, B. Robinson, and A. Koutsouris. Am. J. Physiol. 266 (Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 29): G214-G221, 1994]. We have previously shown that phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin II (MLC) is associated with decreases in TER and have suggested that contraction of the perijunctional actomyosin ring (PAMR) increases  (TJ) permeability [J. R. Turner, B. K. Rill, S. L. Carlson, D. Carnes, R. Kerner, R. J. Mrsny, and J. L. Madara. Am. J. Physiol. 273 (Cell Physiol. 42): C1378-C1385, 1997]. We therefore hypothesized that PKC activation alters TER via relaxation of the PAMR. Activation of PKC by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) resulted in a progressive dose-dependent increase in TER that was apparent within 15 min (111% of controls) and maximal within 2 h (142% of controls). Similar increases were induced by a diacylglycerol analog, and the effects of both PMA and the diacylglycerol analog were prevented by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I. PMA treatment caused progressive decreases in MLC phosphorylation, by 12% at 15 min and 41% at 2 h. Phosphorylation of MLC kinase (MLCK) increased by 64% within 15 min of PMA treatment and was stable over 2 h (51% greater than that of controls). Thus increases in MLCK phosphorylation preceded decreases in MLC phosphorylation. These data suggest that PKC regulates TER via decreased phosphorylation of MLC, possibly due to inhibitory phosphorylation of MLCK. The decreased phosphorylation of MLC likely reduces PAMR tension, leading to decreased TJ permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28551186>Key role of short-chain fatty acids in epithelial barrier failure during ruminal acidosis.</a></h2><p>Subacute ruminal acidosis is induced by high concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA, mainly , propionate, and butyrate) that release protons to decrease the pH of the ruminal digesta. This low pH, in turn, is thought to damage epithelial barrier function. The present study applied a model of simulated ruminal acidosis ex vivo to investigate if SCFA directly contribute to epithelial barrier failure beyond their role as proton donors. Epithelial tissues from the rumen of slaughtered sheep were mounted in Ussing chambers and incubated under 3 different conditions. Two groups were incubated in the absence of SCFA at mucosal pH 6.1 (control) and pH 5.1, respectively, for 7 h. A third group was first incubated in a mucosal solution containing 100 mM SCFA at pH 5.1 for 2 h and, thereafter, in a mucosal solution without SCFA at pH 6.1 for the remaining 5 h. Transepithelial conductance (G), short-circuit current (I), and fluorescein fluxes were determined. After 7 h of incubation, the expression levels of claudin-1, claudin-4, claudin-7, and occludin were measured by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and Western blot. Furthermore, the local distribution of these  (TJ) proteins was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. A 7-h incubation at pH 5.1 in the absence of SCFA did not influence either G or fluorescein flux rates of ruminal tissues ex vivo compared with the control. In contrast, incubation at pH 5.1 with SCFA for only 2 h induced increases in G and fluorescein flux rates that continued even after tissues were returned back to pH 6.1. Expression analysis showed that pH 5.1 without SCFA for 7 h induced no changes in mRNA expression of claudin-1, claudin-4, claudin-7, and occludin and a selective decrease in protein expression of only claudin-4 compared with the control. However, a 2-h incubation at pH 5.1 in the presence of SCFA decreased the mRNA-expression of claudin-7, as well as the protein expression of claudin-4, claudin-7, and occludin. The decreased expression of these TJ proteins in the group incubated with SCFA was also evident in immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry additionally evidenced a considerable retraction of all tested TJ proteins out of the TJ in that group. We conclude that a low mucosal pH of 5.1 is tolerated well by ruminal epithelia for several hours. However, a low pH in combination with SCFA induces damage to the TJ and disturbs barrier function, which is not immediately reversible upon the removal of the acidotic insult.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

While a number of studies have shown that naturally occurring anti-oxidants may be applicable for prevention and therapy for those diseases, most in vitro anti-oxidation tests reported have not provided significant insight into the absorption efficiency or metabolism of dietary anti-oxidants in the gastrointestinal tract. In the present study, we established a novel assay system by focusing on the bioconversion of food constituents using differentiated Caco-2 cells as a model of human intestinal epithelial cells. Various fresh food preparations [ginger, garlic, shimeji (Hypsizigus marmoreus), onion, carrot] were added to the apical side of differentiated Caco-2 monolayers. After incubation, the medium was recovered and tested for its inhibitory effects on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA)-induced generation in differentiated HL-60 cells, and on combined lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and interferon (IFN)-gamma -induced NO generation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The garlic preparation (25% v/v) basolateral medium abolished generation without any cytotoxicity toward HL-60 cells, though it was cytotoxic to Caco-2 cells. In the NO generation tests, all of the food preparations showed notable inhibitory activity, while the garlic preparation (5% v/v) basolateral medium inhibited NO generation with substantial cytotoxicity toward RAW 264.7 cells. Interestingly, the carrot preparation (1% v/v) basolateral medium inhibited NO generation in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner without any cytotoxicity toward RAW 264.7 or Caco-2 cells, and its activities were higher than those of the carrot preparation alone (1% v/v). Our results indicate that the present assay system is appropriate and reliable for determination of the anti-oxidative efficacy of dietary phytochemicals in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17625592>Claudin expression modulations reflect an injury response in the murine epidermis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8563191>Nuclear alterations during acrosomal cap formation in spermatids of lead-treated rats.</a></h2><p>Ultrastructural studies were conducted to assess the effect of lead (Pb 5 mg/kg IP for 16 days as lead ) on rat spermiogenesis. Results showed swelling of nuclei and acrosomes in round spermatids. In Sertoli cells, nuclei appeared fragmentated, whereas the cytoplasm exhibited a vacuolated appearance and a few structures delimitated by a double membrane that contain parallelly arranged microtubules and cross-striated fine fibrils. Sertoli cell  remained intact. There was no significant change in epididymal sperm motility and counts, although testicular and blood lead levels were found to be elevated after lead exposure.

These  are now redefined in terms of their configuration after treatment of brain tissue in uranyl  before dehydration. Instead of a median dense lamina, they are bisected by a median gap 20-30 A wide which is continuous with the rest of the interspace. The patency of these "gap " is further demonstrated by the penetration of horseradish peroxidase or lanthanum into the median gap, the latter tracer delineating there a polygonal substructure. However, either tracer can circumvent gap  because they are plaque-shaped rather than complete, circumferential belts. , which retain a pentalaminar appearance after uranyl  block treatment, are restricted primarily to the endothelium of parenchymal capillaries and the epithelium of the choroid plexus. They form rows of extensive, overlapping occlusions of the interspace and are neither circumvented nor penetrated by peroxidase and lanthanum. These  are morphologically distinguishable from the "labile" pentalaminar appositions which appear or disappear according to the preparative method and which do not interfere with the intercellular movement of tracers. Therefore, the interspaces of the brain are generally patent, allowing intercellular movement of colloidal materials. Endothelial and epithelial  occlude the interspaces between blood and parenchyma or cerebral ventricles, thereby constituting a structural basis for the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12445825>Ectodomain shedding of nectin-1alpha by SF/HGF and TPA in MDCK cells.</a></h2><p>Nectin is a Ca(2+)-independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecule implicated in the organization of the junctional complex comprised of E-cadherin-based adherens  and claudin-based  in epithelial cells. Scatter factor (SF)/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA), a tumor-promoting phorbol ester, induce cell spreading, followed by cell-cell dissociation and cell scattering, in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. We found here that SF/HGF and TPA induced proteolytic cleavage of nectin-1alpha in the ectodomain, resulting in generation of the 80-kDa extracellular fragment and the 33-kDa fragment composed of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, in MDCK cells. This shedding of nectin-1alpha was inhibited by metalloprotease inhibitors. These results indicate that SF/HGF and TPA induce the ectodomain shedding of nectin-1alpha presumably by a metalloprotease, and have raised the possibility that this shedding is involved in the SF/HGF- and TPA-induced cell-cell dissociation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17210245>ZO-1 is required for protein kinase C gamma-driven disassembly of connexin 43.</a></h2><p>We have previously reported that protein kinase C gamma (PKC-gamma) is activated by phorbol-12-myristate-13- (TPA) and that this causes PKC-gamma translocation to membranes and phosphorylation of the gap  protein, connexin 43 (Cx43). This phosphorylation, on S368 of Cx43, causes disassembly of Cx43 out of cell junctional plaques resulting in the inhibition of dye transfer. The purpose of this study is to identify the specific role of zonula occludens protein-1 (ZO-1), a  protein with recently established effects on gap , in this PKC-gamma-driven Cx43 disassembly. For this purpose, ZO-1 levels in lens epithelial cells in culture were decreased by up to 70% using specific siRNA. The down-regulation of ZO-1 caused a stable interaction of PKC-gamma with Cx43 even without normal enzyme activation by TPA. However, after TPA activation of the PKC-gamma, the Cx43 did not disassemble out of plaques even though the PKC-gamma enzyme was activated and the Cx43 was phosphorylated on S368. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the siRNA treatment caused a loss of ZO-1 from borders of large junctional Cx43 cell-to-cell plaques and resulted in the accumulation of Cx43 aggregates inside of cells. Loss of the specific "plaquetosome" arrangement of large Cx43 plaques surrounded by ZO-1 was accompanied by a complete loss of functional dye transfer. These results suggest that ZO-1 is required for Cx43 control, both for dye transfer, and, for the PKC-gamma-driven disassembly response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9496347>Seminal fluid factor increases the resistance of the  junctional complex of cultured human cervical epithelium CaSki cells.</a></h2><p>To determine the effects of human seminal fluid on cervical paracellular resistance.Experimental study.Healthy volunteers in an academic research environment; cultures of human CaSki cells on filters, with phenotypic characteristics of the endocervix.Healthy men donating sperm to a sperm bank.Seminal fluid was obtained as the discarded fluid from ejaculates.Changes in transepithelial electrical resistance across CaSki cells on filters were determined in an Ussing chamber from successive measurements of the short-circuit current and the transepithelial potential difference. Changes in the dilution potential (and hence in the ratio of Cl- to Na+ mobilities) were determined after lowering the NaCl concentration in the luminal solution.Seminal fluid increased transepithelial electrical resistance acutely (t1/2, 2 minutes), reversibly, and in a dose-related manner (ED50, 1%). The effect of seminal fluid was abolished when the extracellular calcium level was lowered, and the increase in transepithelial electrical resistance correlated with a decrease in the ratio Cl- to Na+ mobilities, indicating an increase in the resistance of the  junctional complex. The increase in transepithelial electrical resistance in response to seminal fluid was nonadditive to that of sn-1,2-dioctanoyl diglyceride (a stable diacylglyceride and activator of protein kinase C), and it was abolished by prolonged preincubation with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13- (to downregulate protein kinase C) or with staurosporin (to inhibit protein kinase C), suggesting that seminal fluid acts through a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. Slower (t1/2, 3.3 minutes) increases in transepithelial electrical resistance occurred when seminal fluid was added only to the luminal or the subluminal solution. Treatment with pertussis toxin, adenosine triphosphatase, or trypsin had no effect on the changes in transepithelial electrical resistance. Seminal fluid increased cytosolic calcium, but changes in cytosolic calcium are not important for the increases in transepithelial electrical resistance, suggesting that the effect of seminal fluid is not receptor-mediated. Preliminary studies indicate that the factor(s) in seminal fluid that increases transepithelial electrical resistance is a labile, low molecular weight (< 10 kd) lipid.Seminal fluid may regulate cervical mucus production in vivo by modulating endocervical permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3464217>Effects of tumor promoters on LLC-PK1 renal epithelial  and transepithelial fluxes.</a></h2><p>The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) irreversibly dissipates the electrical potential difference (PD) across LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cell sheets in a dose-dependent manner. The promoter is equally effective when presented to either cell surface. TPA is also equally effective at dissipating the apical-negative PD or the heretofore undescribed apical-positive PD, both of which can exist spontaneously across this monolayer. Diffusion potentials arising from imposed NaCl gradients across LLC-PK1 cell sheets are likewise reduced by TPA. The non-tumor-promoting parent compound, phorbol, is ineffective, but the more hydrophilic TPA analogue, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) is as effective as TPA. Unlike TPA, the effects of PDBU are reversible. By observing the (paracellular) fluxes of D-mannitol and polyethylene glycol, these effects on PD are shown to be due to increased permeability of the . This effect is immediately reversible once PDBU is removed. These findings are discussed in light of the ramifications of the breakdown of epithelial compartments in vivo and the role this could play in the regulation of epithelial cell growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10370058>Anion selectivity of apical membrane conductance of Calu 3 human airway epithelium.</a></h2><p>Anion selectivity of the cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and other channels and parallel pathways expressed endogenously in apical membranes of polarized Calu-3 epithelial monolayers was studied under control conditions and during cAMP stimulation. Basolateral membranes were eliminated using alpha-toxin. The cAMP-stimulated, gradient-driven currents had the sequence Br>/=Cl>/=NO3>SCN> I>/=F>formate>HCO3>>propionate=butyrate=ATP= PPi=PO4=SO4=0. Selectivity of parallel cAMP-independent pathway(s) was Br>Cl=SCN=NO3>I>formate=F >HCO3>>propionate. SCN, I, F or formate blocked cAMP-stimulated, but not control, Cl currents. Anions >0.53 nm in diameter were impermeant, suggesting that the apical CFTR channel has a limiting diameter of 0.53 nm. The selectivity, blocking patterns and pore size of the cAMP-stimulated conductance pathway were very similar to those in previous reports in which CFTR was heterologously expressed in non-epithelial cells. Thus, CFTR appears to be the major apical anion conductance pathway in Calu-3 cells, and its conduction properties are independent of the expression system. CFTR in Calu-3 cells also conducts physiologically relevant anions, but not ATP, PO4 or SO4. A pathway parallel (probably a ) showed a different selectivity than CFTR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6748616>Tubulocisternal endoplasmic reticulum in human eccrine sweat glands.</a></h2><p>Human eccrine sweat glands, including those expressing the gene for cystic fibrosis, were stained sequentially en bloc with uranyl , lead citrate and copper sulfate, and osmium tetroxide for the ultrastructural demonstration of tubulocisternal endoplasmic reticulum (TER).

We have studied the effects of the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) in the differentiation phenotype of mucus-secreting (HT-29 M6) and absorptive (HT-29 M3) cells. TPA prevented the accumulation of differentiation markers such as dipeptidylpeptidase IV, villin or mucins, down-regulated the expression of these molecules in post-confluent differentiated cell cultures and induced the loss of the functional integrity of the  in the monolayer (i.e. decreased transepithelial resistance and inhibited dome formation). These effects were mediated by activation of protein kinase C (PK-C), as demonstrated using the specific inhibitor GF109203x. Analysis by immunoblotting of the PK-C isoforms present in HT-29 M6 cells revealed that the most abundant TPA-sensitive isoform was PK-C epsilon, although low levels of cPK-C were also detected.

E-Cadherin and nectin are major cell-cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) at AJs, whereas claudin, occludin and junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) are major CAMs at TJs. When MDCK cells precultured at 2 microm Ca(2+) are cultured at 2 mm Ca(2+), nectin first forms cell-cell adhesion and recruits E-cadherin to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites to form AJs. Thereafter, nectin recruits first JAM-A and then claudin-1 and occludin to the apical side of AJs to form TJs. In contrast, when MDCK cells precultured at 2 microm Ca(2+) are cultured at 2 microm Ca(2+) in the presence of a phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA), a TJ-like structure is formed without the formation of the E-cadherin-based AJs. We showed here that GFP-E-cadherin, which did not trans-interact due to 2 microm Ca(2+) but associated with alpha- and beta-catenins and p120(ctn), was recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites by the action of TPA. The nectin inhibitors, which inhibited the trans-interaction of nectin, inhibited the recruitment of GFP-E-cadherin and their associating catenins by the action of TPA. Microbeads coated with the extracellular fragment of nectin recruited not only cellular nectin but also GFP-E-cadherin and their associating catenins by the action of TPA. These results indicate that when the TJ-like structure is formed by the action of TPA, non-trans-interacting E-cadherin and its associating catenins are recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites and that the trans-interaction of E-cadherin is not essential for the formation of TJs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10222469>Anion size of sodium salts and simple taste reaction times.</a></h2><p>Simple taste reaction times (RT) and taste intensities were measured in adult humans for 100-mM aqueous solutions of sodium chloride, , glutamate, ascorbate, and gluconate flowed over the anterodorsal tongue with a closed liquid delivery system.

Mice were sacrificed 24 hours post-operatively or followed seven days for survival.Septic alcohol-fed mice had a significantly higher mortality than septic water-fed mice (74% vs. 41%, p = 0.01). This was associated with worsened gut integrity in alcohol-fed mice with elevated intestinal epithelial apoptosis, decreased crypt proliferation and shortened villus length. Further, alcohol-fed mice had higher intestinal permeability with decreased ZO-1 and occludin protein expression in the intestinal . The frequency of splenic and bone marrow CD4+ T cells was similar between groups; however, splenic CD4+ T cells in septic alcohol-fed mice had a marked increase in both TNF and IFN-γ production following ex vivo stimulation. Neither the frequency nor function of CD8+ T cells differed between alcohol-fed and water-fed septic mice. NK cells were decreased in both the spleen and bone marrow of alcohol-fed septic mice. Pulmonary myeloperoxidase levels and BAL levels of G-CSF and TFG-β were higher in alcohol-fed mice. Pancreatic metabolomics demonstrated increased , adenosine, xanthine, acetoacetate, 3-hydroxybutyrate and betaine in alcohol-fed mice and decreased cytidine, uracil, fumarate, creatine phosphate, creatine, and choline. Serum and peritoneal cytokines were generally similar between alcohol-fed and water-fed mice, and there were no differences in bacteremia, lung wet to dry weight, or pulmonary, liver or splenic histology.When subjected to the same septic insult, mice with chronic alcohol ingestion have increased mortality.

Claudin is a key cell-cell adhesion molecule that forms TJ strands at TJs. JAM is associated with claudin through their cytoplasmic tail-binding protein, ZO-1. JAM is furthermore associated with Par-3, a cell polarity protein which forms a ternary complex with Par-6 and atypical protein kinase C. Nectin is another Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecule which localizes at adherens  (AJs). Nectin is associated with E-cadherin through their respective cytoplasmic tail-binding proteins, afadin and catenins, and involved in the formation of AJs cooperatively with E-cadherin. We show here that nectin is furthermore involved in the localization of JAM at TJs. During the formation of the junctional complex consisting of AJs and TJs in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, JAM was recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites. This recruitment of JAM was inhibited by nectin inhibitors, which inhibited the trans-interaction of nectin. Microbeads coated with the extracellular fragment of nectin, that interacted with cellular nectin, also recruited JAM to the bead-MDCK cell contact sites. Furthermore, when cadherin-deficient L fibroblasts stably expressing both exogenous JAM and nectin (nectin-JAM-L cells) were co-cultured with L fibroblasts expressing only nectin (nectin-L cells), JAM was concentrated at the cell-cell adhesion sites between nectin-JAM-L and nectin-L cells without the trans-interaction of JAM. Analyses of the localization and immunoprecipitation of JAM revealed that it was associated with nectin through afadin and ZO-1. These results suggest that nectin has a role in the localization of JAM at TJs in the process of the formation of the junctional complex in epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21169903>The effect of L-ascorbic acid and/or tocopherol supplementation on electrophysiological parameters of the colon of rats chronically exposed to lead.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of diet supplementation with L-ascorbic acid (500 mg/L), tocopherol (3 mg/kg b.w.), and/or a water soluble analog of tocopherol (Trolox) (48 mg/L) on ion transport in the colon of rats subjected to a chronic exposure (9 months) to 0.1% lead  in drinking water.The electrophysiological parameters of the colon wall were measured with Ussing methods.

Here, we investigated the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and protein kinase C (PKC), in the process of reassembly of cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion of Caco-2 cells. We used chemical activation of PKC and EGFR with 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA), a tumor-promoting agent, pretreatment with protein kinase inhibitors and subcellular fractionation to analyze the effect of the phorbol ester on the redistribution of junctional proteins. Transepithelial resistance (TER), electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analyses were also carried out. Activation with TPA resulted in disassembly of adherens  (AJs), but the  (TJ) structure and function remained unaltered. TPA affected E-cadherin levels. In Caco-2 cells at day 2 of culture, when most E-cadherin is not associated with the cytoskeleton, a decrease in the level of this protein was observed as soon as 6 h after TPA addition. However, at day 5 of culture, the major effect observed after 6 h of treatment was a translocation of the protein from the Triton-insoluble to the -soluble fraction. On the other hand, TPA did not significantly affect the E-cadherin-associated proteins alpha and beta-catenins. Potent specific EGFR inhibitors, such as PD153035 and Tyrphostin 25, as well as Calphostin C, an inhibitor of PKC, significantly blocked the effect of TPA on AJs. Furthermore, inhibition of the TPA effect by the PD98059 MAPK inhibitor suggests that activation of this kinase was the final event in the modulation of cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Pretreatment of cell monolayers with Calphostin C before EGF treatment, one of the ligands of EGFR, blocked the redistribution of E-cadherin caused by EGF. Based on these results, we conclude that both EGFR and PKC activation are involved in TPA-induced cell signaling for modulation of cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion and cell shape in Caco-2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7194150>Tumor promoter-induced changes in the permeability of epithelial cell .</a></h2><p>Treatment of the kidney epithelial cell line MDCK with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) induces a large increase in the permeability of  within 2-4 hr. This change in transepithelial permeability is accompanied by alterations in cell morphology that include the opening of , loss of apical surface microvilli and the formation of cytoplasmic processes containing numerous microtubules, microfilaments and 10 nm intermediate filaments. Simultaneously, TPA also stimulates a 10-20 fold increase in the synthesis and secretion of the serine protease plasminogen activator (PA); however, the inhibition of PA synthesis by cycloheximide does not prevent the morphological changes or the increased  junctional permeability, suggesting that PA is not involved in these early TPA-induced events. Drugs that inhibit cytoskeletal function, such as cytochalasins B and D, colchicine, and vinblastine sulfate, are all relatively effective in preventing the TPA-induced morphological changes but not the increases in transepithelial permeability. Our results provide evidence that possible sites of TPA action include epithelial  as well as components of the cytoskeleton.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22401908>Larazotide  regulates epithelial  in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p> (TJs) control paracellular permeability and apical-basolateral polarity of epithelial cells, and can be regulated by exogenous and endogenous stimuli. Dysregulated permeability is associated with pathological conditions, such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Herein we studied the mechanism by which larazotide , an 8-mer peptide and TJ regulator, inhibits the cellular changes elicited by gliadin fragments, AT-1002, and cytokines. Previously, we demonstrated that AT-1002, a 6-mer peptide derived from the Vibrio cholerae zonula occludens toxin ZOT, caused several biochemical changes in IEC6 and Caco-2 cells resulting in decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased TJ permeability. In this study, larazotide  inhibited the redistribution and rearrangement of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and actin caused by AT-1002 and gliadin fragments in Caco-2 and IEC6 cells. Functionally, larazotide  inhibited the AT-1002-induced TEER reduction and TJ opening in Caco-2 cells. Additionally, larazotide  inhibited the translocation of a gliadin 13-mer peptide, which has been implicated in celiac disease, across Caco-2 cell monolayers. Further, apically applied larazotide  inhibited the increase in TJ permeability elicited by basolaterally applied cytokines. Finally, when tested in vivo in gliadin-sensitized HLA-HCD4/DQ8 double transgenic mice, larazotide  inhibited gliadin-induced macrophage accumulation in the intestine and preserved normal TJ structure. Taken together, our data suggest that larazotide  inhibits changes elicited by AT-1002, gliadin, and cytokines in epithelial cells and preserves TJ structure and function in vitro and in vivo.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Electron microscopic examination of embryos stained en bloc with uranyl , and the study of  permeability using horseradish peroxidase and lanthanum nitrate provided information on structure, intermembrane spacing and permeability of the junctional complexes. In addition, the freeze fracture technique was used with day 5 and day 6 blastocysts, since the large size of these embryos facilitated use of this method. These experiments showed that although rudimentary  were present between blastomeres of the early cleavage stages, effective  were not present until the blastocyst stage. Electron microscopic examination of thin sections revealed apical foci of membrane approximation or "fusion" between trophoblast cells by day 4. Freeze fracturing revealed a lattice of interconnecting ridges (on the A face) and grooves (on the B face) in the apical region between trophoblast cells of the day 5 blastocyst. This lattice formed a continuous band along the apical margin of each cell, and therefore constituted a zonula occludens. The zonula occludens of the day 5 blastocyst averages 2-3 ridges per lattice, while day 6 blastocysts had lattices that averaged 5-6 ridges. Also seen in the freeze fracture replicas from the day 5 and day 6 blastocysts were local accumulations of intramembranous particles on the A face. These particles were often observed in aggregates similar to those of previously described gap . It could not be determined whether these small regions of particles were true gap  or a possible primitive form of gap  because the complementary pitted surfaces (B face pits) were not demonstrated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6105159>The junctional complex in the intestine of Sagitta setosa (Chaetognatha): the paired septate .</a></h2><p>The junctional complex of the intestine of Sagitta setosa has been studied in tissues stained with uranyl  or after lanthanum impregnation, and by freeze-cleavage. All types of  have been characterized in both perpendicular and tangential planes. From the apex to the base of the cell the following  occur in this order: a zonula adhaerens; a septate  where the septa occur in pairs; a pleated sheet septate ; and numerous gap  of the A-type. From the upper part of the cells inwards to the septate , the membranes follow a relatively straight path. In the lower part of the cells the membranes are deeply interdigitating. At the intersection between 3 cells a very different  is to be observed where small units, periodically disposed, bind the membranes of the 3 adjoining cells. Each unit is composed of 3 short segments which bind the cell membranes to a central ring 16.6 +/- 2.3 nm in outer diameter. The paired septate  constitutes a new type. Its main features are that the septa are paired and occur in 2 formations, one the 'loose formation', with elements between the septa of each pair, and the other, a ' formation'. After lanthanum impregnation, the thickness of each septum is seen to be about 3 nm and the undulation period 12.6 +/- 1.6 nm. On freeze-fractures 10-nm particles are found on crests on the PF face and in furrows on the EF face. The possible significance of this type of  is discussed. The junctional complex described is analogous to those found in various invertebrate epithelia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10330054>cAMP-dependent and -independent downregulation of type II Na-Pi cotransporters by PTH.</a></h2><p>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) leads to the inhibition of Na-Pi cotransport activity and to the downregulation of the number of type II Na-Pi cotransporters in proximal tubules, as well as in opossum kidney (OK) cells. PTH is known also to lead to an activation of adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C in proximal tubular preparations, as well as in OK cells. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of these two regulatory pathways in OK cells in the PTH-dependent downregulation of the number of type II Na-Pi cotransporters. We have addressed this issue by using pharmacological activators of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC), i.e., 8-bromo-cAMP (8-BrcAMP) and beta-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (beta-TPA), respectively, as well as by the use of synthetic peptide fragments of PTH that activate adenylate cyclase and/or phospholipase C, i.e., PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(3-34), respectively. Our results show that PTH signal transduction via cAMP-dependent, as well as cAMP-independent, pathways leads to a membrane retrieval and degradation of type II Na-Pi cotransporters and, thereby, to the inhibition of Na-Pi cotransport activity. Thereby, the cAMP-independent regulatory pathway leads only to partial effects (approximately 50%).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29385473>Effect of ruminal acidosis and short-term low feed intake on indicators of gastrointestinal barrier function in Holstein steers.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine effect of ruminal acidosis (RA) and low feed intake [LFI] on the regional barrier function of the gastrointestinal tract. Twenty-one Holstein steers were fed for ad libitum intake for 5 d (control [CON]), fed at 25% of ad libitum intake for 5 d (LFI), or provided 2 d of ad libitum intake followed by 1-d of feed restriction (25% of ad libitum intake), 1 d where 30% of ad libitum dry matter intake (DMI) was provided as pelleted barley followed by the full allocation (RA) and fed for ad libitum intake the following day. Tissues and digesta from the rumen, omasum, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, proximal, and distal colon were collected. Permeability was assessed using the mucosal-to-serosal flux of inulin (JMS-inulin) and mannitol (JMS-mannitol). Digesta pH was 0.81, 0.63, and 0.42 pH units less for RA than CON in the rumen, cecum, and proximal colon; while, LFI had pH that was 0.47 and 0.36 pH units greater in the rumen and proximal colon compared to CON. Total ruminal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration were less for LFI (92 mM; P = 0.010) and RA (87 mM; P = 0.007) than CON (172 mM) steers. In the proximal colon, the proportion of butyrate (P = 0.025 and P = 0.022) and isobutyrate (P = 0.019 and P = 0.019) were greater, and  (P = 0.028 and P = 0.028) was less for LFI and RA, respectively, when compared to CON steers. Ruminal papillae length, width, perimeter, and surface area were 1.21 mm, 0.78 mm, 3.84 mm, and 11.15 mm2 less for LFI than CON; while, RA decreased papillae width by 0.52 mm relative to CON. The JMS-mannitol was less for LFI steers than CON in the proximal colon (P = 0.041) and in the distal colon (P = 0.015). Increased gene expression for claudin 1, occludin, -cell  protein 1 and 2, and toll-like receptor 4 were detected for LFI relative to CON in the rumen, jejunum, and proximal colon. For RA steers, expression of toll-like receptor 4 in the rumen, and occludin and -cell  protein 1 were greater in the jejunum than CON. An acute RA challenge decreased pH in the rumen and large intestine but did not increase tissue permeability due to increases in the expression of genes related to barrier function within 1 d of the challenge. Steers exposed to LFI for 5 d had reduced ruminal SCFA concentrations, smaller ruminal papillae dimensions, and increased tissue permeability in the proximal and distal colon despite increases for genes related to barrier function and immune function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22825365>A randomized, double-blind study of larazotide  to prevent the activation of celiac disease during gluten challenge.</a></h2><p>In patients with celiac disease, enteropathy is caused by the entry of gluten peptides into the lamina propria of the intestine, in which their immunogenicity is potentiated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and T-helper type 1-mediated immune responses are triggered.  disassembly and paracellular permeability are believed to have an important role in the transport of gluten peptides to the lamina propria. Larazotide  is a  regulator peptide that, in vitro, prevents the opening of intestinal epithelial . The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of larazotide  in protecting against gluten-induced intestinal permeability and gastrointestinal symptom severity in patients with celiac disease.In this dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study, 86 patients with celiac disease controlled through diet were randomly assigned to larazotide  (0.25, 1, 4, or 8 mg) or placebo three times per day with or without gluten challenge (2.4 g/day) for 14 days. The primary efficacy outcome was the urinary lactulose/mannitol (LAMA) fractional excretion ratio. Secondary endpoints included gastrointestinal symptom severity, quality-of-life measures, and antibodies to tTG.LAMA measurements were highly variable in the outpatient setting. The increase in LAMA ratio associated with the gluten challenge was not statistically significantly greater than the increase in the gluten-free control. Among patients receiving the gluten challenge, the difference in the LAMA ratios for the larazotide  and placebo groups was not statistically significant. However, larazotide  appeared to limit gluten-induced worsening of gastrointestinal symptom severity as measured by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale at some lower doses but not at the higher dose. Symptoms worsened significantly in the gluten challenge-placebo arm compared with the placebo-placebo arm, suggesting that 2.4 g of gluten per day is sufficient to induce reproducible gluten toxicity. Larazotide  was generally well tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed. The most common adverse events were headache and urinary tract infection.LAMA variability in the outpatient setting precluded accurate assessment of the effect of larazotide  on intestinal permeability. However, some lower doses of larazotide  appeared to prevent the increase in gastrointestinal symptom severity induced by gluten challenge.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10861597>Intestinal absorption of octreotide: N-trimethyl chitosan chloride (TMC) ameliorates the permeability and absorption properties of the somatostatin analogue in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Octreotide  is a somatostatin analogue used for the control of endocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the treatment of acromegaly. The oral absorption of octreotide is limited because of the limited permeation across the intestinal epithelium. Both chitosan hydrochloride and N-trimethyl chitosan chloride (TMC), a quaternized chitosan derivative, are nonabsorbable and nontoxic polymers that have been proven to effectively increase the permeation of hydrophilic macromolecules across mucosal epithelia by opening the . This study investigates the intestinal absorption of octreotide when it is coadministered with the polycationic absorption enhancer TMC. Caco-2 cell monolayers were used as an in vitro intestinal epithelium model, and male Wistar rats were used for in vivo studies. Octreotide with or without polymers (TMC; chitosan hydrochloride) was administered intrajejunally in rats, and serum peptide levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. All applications and administrations were performed at neutral pH values (i.e., pH = 7.4). In vitro transport studies with Caco-2 cells revealed an increased permeation of octreotide in the presence of TMC. Enhancement ratios ranged from 34 to 121 with increasing concentrations of the polymer (0.25-1.5%, w/v). In rats, 1.0% (w/v) TMC solution significantly increased the absorption of the peptide analogue, resulting in a 5-fold increase of octreotide bioavailability compared with the controls (octreotide alone). Coadministration of 1.0% (w/v) chitosan hydrochloride did not enhance octreotide bioavailability. These results in combination with the nontoxic character of TMC suggest that this polymer is a promising excipient in the development of solid dosage forms for the peroral delivery and intestinal absorption of octreotide.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14283623>A STUDY OF EXTRACELLULAR SPACE IN CENTRAL NERVOUS TISSUE BY FREEZE-SUBSTITUTION.</a></h2><p>It was attempted to preserve the water distribution in central nervous tissue by rapid freezing followed by substitution fixation at low temperature. The vermis of the cerebellum of white mice was frozen by bringing it into contact with a polished silver mirror maintained at a temperature of about -207 degrees C. The tissue was subjected to substitution fixation in acetone containing 2 per cent OsO(4) at -85 degrees C for 2 days, and then prepared for electron microscopy by embedding in Maraglas, sectioning, and staining with lead citrate or uranyl  and lead. Cerebellum frozen within 30 seconds of circulatory arrest was compared with cerebellum frozen after 8 minutes' asphyxiation. From impedance measurements under these conditions, it could be expected that in the former tissue the electrolyte and water distribution is similar to that in the normal, oxygenated cerebellum, whereas in the asphyxiated tissue a transport of water and electrolytes into the intracellular compartment has taken place. Electron micrographs of tissue frozen shortly after circulatory arrest revealed the presence of an appreciable extracellular space between the axons of granular layer cells. Between glia, dendrites, and presynaptic endings the usual narrow clefts and even  were found. Also the synaptic cleft was of the usual width (250 to 300 A). In asphyxiated tissue, the extracellular space between the axons is either completely obliterated () or reduced to narrow clefts between apposing cell surfaces.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15288477>Disruption of hepatocellular  by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF): a novel mechanism for tumor invasion.</a></h2><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is expressed by many tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is involved in tumor angiogenesis. Little is known about its role for HCC infiltration into normal liver parenchyma.The effects of VEGF on the integrity of  were studied in HepG2 cells and human HCC by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy.VEGF induced within 45 min a marked loss of pseudocanaliculi and disruption of occludin-delineated . This effect of VEGF was mimicked by phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA) and was sensitive to protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition by Gö6850. VEGF induced within 15 min the translocation of the PKC alpha-isoform to the plasma-membrane, but had no effect on the activity of Erks and p38(MAPK). Sections from surgically removed HCC showed expression of VEGF in the tumor and occludin disassembly in normal liver parenchyma next to the tumor.VEGF induces disruption of  in a PKC-alpha dependent manner. In addition to its known angioneogenic properties, VEGF may promote HCC spreading into normal liver parenchyma. The data may provide another rationale for the use of VEGF antagonists for tumor therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9493417>[Electron microscopic study of capillary in the human renal cell carcinoma].</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated the ultrastructure of the microvasculature in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) specimens.RCC specimens from 30 patients were studied by light microscopy after hematoxylin and eosin staining and alpha-smooth muscle actin staining, and by electron microscopy after uranyl  lead nitrate staining or periodic acid thiosemicarbazide gelatin methenamine silver staining.In the light microscopy, the capillaries located adjacent to the renal medullary tubules in normal renal tissue specimen were in an orderly manner, while capillaries in the RCC specimens were found to be densely or sparsely distributed unconventionally. The pericytes encircling the capillary endothelial cells were positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin and formed aggregates in many of the RCC specimens, but did not form aggregates in the normal tissue specimens. In the electron microscopy, capillary endothelial cells in the normal renal tissue specimens were found to form well-developed membranous structure such as characterized by fenestrations and . However, few pericytes were detected. On the other hand, the capillary endothelial cells in RCC specimens were found to be immature with poorly developed junctional complexes. Capillary pericytes with numerous cytoplasmic processes were found in many of the RCC specimens. In addition, the basement membranes of the capillary walls were structurally abnormal in that it was being multilayered. Based on the results of analysis of a total of 324 capillaries observed in all RCC specimens, capillaries could be classified as type I capillaries, associated with well-developed pericytes with numerous processes, or type II capillaries, associated with few pericytes with few processes. Type I capillaries predominated in cases which an angiographically hypervascularity was detected. Whereas, type II capillaries predominated in cases in which angiographically hypovascular pattern were detected.The fine structure of the pericytes seems to reflect the qualitative difference in capillary structure between normal renal tissue and RCC specimens. Therefore, the present findings may contribute to the recognition of intratumoral hemodynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19422706>Protein kinase C activation disrupts epithelial apical  via ROCK-II dependent stimulation of actomyosin contractility.</a></h2><p>Disruption of epithelial cell-cell adhesions represents an early and important stage in tumor metastasis. This process can be modeled in vitro by exposing cells to chemical tumor promoters, phorbol esters and octylindolactam-V (OI-V), known to activate protein kinase C (PKC). However, molecular events mediating PKC-dependent disruption of epithelial cell-cell contact remain poorly understood. In the present study we investigate mechanisms by which PKC activation induces disassembly of  (TJs) and adherens  (AJs) in a model pancreatic epithelium.Exposure of HPAF-II human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell monolayers to either OI-V or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- caused rapid disruption and internalization of AJs and TJs. Activity of classical PKC isoenzymes was responsible for the loss of cell-cell contacts which was accompanied by cell rounding, phosphorylation and relocalization of the F-actin motor nonmuscle myosin (NM) II. The OI-V-induced disruption of AJs and TJs was prevented by either pharmacological inhibition of NM II with blebbistatin or by siRNA-mediated downregulation of NM IIA. Furthermore, AJ/TJ disassembly was attenuated by inhibition of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) II, but was insensitive to blockage of MLCK, calmodulin, ERK1/2, caspases and RhoA GTPase.Our data suggest that stimulation of PKC disrupts epithelial apical  via ROCK-II dependent activation of NM II, which increases contractility of perijunctional actin filaments. This mechanism is likely to be important for cancer cell dissociation and tumor metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17891173>Involvement of Rab13 and JRAB/MICAL-L2 in epithelial cell scattering.</a></h2><p>Epithelial cell scattering recapitulates the first steps of carcinoma invasion/metastasis. While the balance between cell-cell adhesive activity and cell motility ultimately determines this process, its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Adherence  and  (TJs) are primarily responsible for cell-cell adhesive activity and subjected to dynamic remodeling. We previously showed that Rab13 and its effector protein JRAB/MICAL-L2 mediate the endocytic recycling of the integral TJ protein occludin and the assembly of functional TJs. In this study, we examined the role of Rab13 and JRAB/MICAL-L2 in the scattering of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA). Knockdown of Rab13 in canine MDCK cells suppressed the TPA-induced scattering, and this phenotype was restored by re-expression of human Rab13. During TPA-induced MDCK cell scattering, Rab13 was transiently activated and returned to its basal level, and both Rab13 and JRAB/MICAL-L2 were colocalized with F-actin at cell-cell contact sites and then accumulated at emerging lamellipodial structures. TPA-induced MDCK cell scattering was also inhibited by knockdown of canine JRAB/MICAL-L2 and rescued by re-expression of mouse JRAB/MICAL-L2. These results indicate that Rab13 and JRAB/MICAL-L2 are involved in epithelial cell scattering.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18344902>Supplementation with galactooligosaccharides and inulin increases bacterial translocation in artificially reared newborn rats.</a></h2><p>Supplementation of formulas with prebiotics enhances the growth of lactate producing bacteria, and fecal lactate, and  levels in infants. High concentrations of organic acids in intestinal lumen have, however, been shown to impair the intestinal barrier function. To determine whether stimulating the colonic microbiotal metabolism with prebiotics would impair the neonatal intestinal barrier function, artificially reared rats were fed milk formula with or without a mixture of galactooligosaccharides/inulin (GOS/Inulin, 88/12; 5.6 g/L) from the 7th d of life (d7) until weaning (d20). At d18, GOS/inulin supplementation had increased the concentrations of  and lactate in colonic lumen. Although neither ileum-associated microbiota nor colonic permeability (assessed in Ussing chambers), nor the expression of  claudin-2 and claudin-3 mRNA were altered, GOS/inulin supplementation was associated with increased bacterial translocation (BT) toward spleen. None of these effects persisted at d40. We conclude that GOS/inulin supplementation may increase BT in an immature gut. The balance between the potential infectious risk of BT vs. its putative beneficial effect on the maturation of neonatal immune system clearly warrants further study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29690739>[Effects of short chain fatty acid on barrier disruption of human intestinal epithelial cell induced by endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide and the related mechanism].</a></h2><p> To investigate the effects of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) on barrier disruption of human intestinal epithelial cell induced by endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the related mechanism.  The human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 was used to reproduce monolayer-cells. Cells were divided into control group, LPS group, and SCFA+ LPS group according to the random number table. Cells in control group were only routinely cultured with DMEM medium. Cells in LPS group were cultured with DMEM medium and LPS with final mass concentration of 10 μg/mL. Cells in SCFA+ LPS group were cultured with DMEM medium, LPS and SCFA (consisting of 0.5 mmol/L , 0.01 mmol/L propionate, and 0.01 mmol/L butyrate) with final mass concentration of 10 μg/mL. At post culture hour (PCH) 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of cells was determined with an ohmmeter, with sample number of 72. Another portion of cells were divided and treated as above, and then Western blotting was employed to detect the protein expressions of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), occludin, and claudin-1 at PCH 24, with sample number of 6. Another portion of cells were divided and treated as above and then immunofluorescence was used to observe cellular morphology and distribution of ZO-1. Data were processed with analysis of variance of factorial design, one-way analysis of variance, least-significant difference test, and Bonferroni correction.  (1) Compared with that in control group, TER of cells in LPS group was significantly reduced from PCH 1 to 24 (<0.01), while TER of cells in SCFA+ LPS group showed no obvious change (>0.05). TER of cells in SCFA+ LPS group was significantly higher than that in LPS group from PCH 1 to 24 (<0.01). (2) Compared with the protein expressions of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 of cells in control group (1.25±0.10, 1.17±0.04, and 1.24±0.20), those of cells in LPS group (0.74±0.23, 0.76±0.11, and 0.77±0.11) at PCH 24 were significantly decreased (<0.05), while those of cells in SCFA+ LPS group (1.23±0.46, 1.05±0.09, and 1.01±0.13) showed no significant differences (>0.05). Protein expressions of occludin and claudin-1 of cells in SCFA+ LPS group were significantly higher than those in LPS group at PCH 24 (<0.05). Protein expression of ZO-1 of cells in SCFA+ LPS group was higher than that in LPS group at PCH 24 with no significant difference (>0.05). (3) At PCH 24, cells in control group were compact in arrangement with pebble-like appearance, and ZO-1 was distributed smoothly and continuously along the cell membrane. In LPS group, cells were sparse in arrangement with change in appearance, and ZO-1 was distributed uncontinuously along the cell membrane with curls and breaks. In SCFA+ LPS group, the appearance of cells and distribution of ZO-1 were remarkably ameliorated compared with those in LPS group.  SCFA can alleviate the barrier disruption of human intestinal epithelial cell induced by LPS through interdicting the abnormal distribution of ZO-1 and decrease of TER and  proteins' expressions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1707214>[Pathophysiology of intraocular neovascularization].</a></h2><p>The pathology of intraocular neovascularization was studied in human and animal eyes by means of electron microscopy and histochemistry, and also by tissue culture of bovine retinal small vessels. The newly formed vessels in the vitreous obtained at the time of vitrectomy from the eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion lacked  and formed fenestration in the endothelial cells. When 1 microgram of the basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) enveloped in ethylene vinyl  copolymer was implanted into the vitreous of monkey eyes, new vessels were formed in the iris in all eyes and in the vitreous in 12 eyes out of 14 experimental eyes. The origins of new vessels were the iris vessels in the iris, and both stromal vessels of the ciliary body and retinal vessels in the vitreous. These vessels showed fenestration in the endothelial cells. The activity of the lysosomal enzyme detected by acid phosphatase increased in the epithelial layer of the ciliary body. The new vessels in the vitreous of rabbits were seen in 9 out of 10 eyes when b-FGF was implanted in the vitreous with an intravitreal injection of amino adipic acid solution (1 mg in 0.2 ml of physical saline), although none of the 8 eyes formed new vessels when sodium iodate was injected intravenously after implantation of b-FGF with aminoadipic acid. Corneal neovascularization was formed by implantation of 250 ng of b-FGF into the corneal micropockets of the guinea pigs, and regressed after the b-FGF was removed. The endothelial budding and protrusion were frequently seen during the course of neovascularization. Immunohistochemical detections showed positive stainings for fibronectin in most front-end lesions, for laminin and type 4 collagen associated with the endothelial cells, and for factor VIII only on the endothelial cells which formed the vascular lumen. The acid phosphatase activity was detected on the leucocytes infiltrating in the corneal stroma. In the course of regression of corneal neovascularization, initial pathological change was thrombus formation followed by disappearance of endothelial cells, although the basement membrane of the endothelial cells remained. Fibronectin reduced its activity in the early stage of regression, laminin and type 4 collagen remained even after the vascular lumen had subsided, and factor VIII was stained in a geographically irregular manner. Migrating activity of the cultured-bovine retinal small vessels was accelerated by fibronectin and fetal bovine serum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15622522>Influence of protein kinase C on transcription of the  elements ZO-1 and occludin.</a></h2><p> as an epithelial barrier against paracellular diffusion have mainly been investigated on the protein level with particular respect to subcellular localization. In this study, real-time PCR has been established to investigate the influence of protein kinase C (PKC) modulation on the transcription of  elements occludin and ZO-1 in the cell line T84. Activation of PKC by the phorbol ester TPA induced ZO-1 and occludin transcription, whereas PKC inhibition lead to decreased expression levels. Activation of PKC exerted its effect on transcript level directly. PKC signal was partially transduced via MEK1/MEK2 but depended strongly on MAPK independent pathways probably involving nuclear localized PKC, whereas p38 signaling was not implicated. TPA induced loss of function concomitant with a dislocation of ZO-1 and occludin could be prevented by inhibition of MEK1 by PD98059. Overall ZO-1 and occludin seem to be identically regulated in colonic epithelium on the transcript level.(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28214040>Reinforcement of intestinal epithelial barrier by arabinoxylans in overweight and obese subjects: A randomized controlled trial: Arabinoxylans in gut barrier.</a></h2><p>Obesity and metabolic diseases are associated with alterations in microbial composition and impaired gut barrier. Previous in vitro and animal studies have shown that arabinoxylans (AX) have the potential to modulate gut microbiota and gut barrier and therefore could have a protective role. Primary aim of the study was to investigate the effect of AX on intestinal permeability. Secondary aims included the effect of AX on gene transcription and protein expression of  (TJ), intestinal microbiota composition and activity, immune response and metabolic markers in overweight and obese individuals.In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 47 overweight subjects were randomly assigned to groups receiving 7.5 g/d AX (n = 16), 15 g/d AX (n = 17) or 15 g/d placebo (n = 14) for 6 wks. Intestinal permeability was investigated using a multi-sugar test. Sigmoid colon tissue was obtained from a subgroup (n = 26) for analyzing gene transcription and mucosal expression of TJ proteins. Fecal samples were collected to assess microbial composition and activity. Furthermore, the production of cytokines by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was examined. Blood was also sampled for measuring metabolic markers.No significant changes in gastrointestinal permeability and TJ protein expression were observed after 6 wks AX supplementation compared to placebo. However, gene transcription of occludin was upregulated in the 7.5 g AX group, and transcription of claudin-3 and claudin-4 were upregulated in the 15 g AX group compared to placebo. Furthermore, fecal microbiota diversity was decreased after 6 wks 15 g AX treatment, but no change in relative abundance of dominant phyla was observed. AX intake significantly decreased fecal pH and increased fecal concentrations of total SCFAs, , propionate and butyrate, compared to placebo. Additionally, a decreased TNFα production by stimulated PBMCs was observed after 15 g AX treatment. No changes in metabolic markers were detected.Regular consumption of AX resulted in a more beneficial fermentation profile in overweight and obese individuals. Further studies are required to assess whether such fermentation profile will translate into improved gut barrier function and immune health.

Nevertheless, during the past decade, there have been a growing number of publications focused on human genetics, the gut microbiome, and proteomics, suggesting that loss of mucosal barrier function, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, may substantially affect antigen trafficking, ultimately causing chronic inflammation, including autoimmunity, in genetically predisposed individuals. The gut mucosa works as a semipermeable barrier in that it permits nutrient absorption and also regulates immune surveillance while retaining potentially harmful microbes and environmental antigens within the intestinal lumen. Celiac disease (CD), a systemic, immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, is associated with altered gut permeability. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that gliadin, a prolamine component of gluten that is implicated in CD pathogenesis, is capable to disassembling intercellular junctional proteins by upregulating the zonulin pathway, which can be inhibited by the zonulin antagonist larazotide . In this review, we will focus on CD as a paradigm of chronic inflammatory diseases in order to outline the contribution of gut paracellular permeability toward disease pathogenesis; moreover, we will summarize current evidence derived from available clinical trials of larazotide  in CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20566751>Transcriptional control of  proteins via a protein kinase C signal pathway in human telomerase reverse transcriptase-transfected human pancreatic duct epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>In human pancreatic cancer, integral membrane proteins of  claudins are abnormally regulated, making these proteins promising molecular diagnostic and therapeutic targets. However, the regulation of claudin-based  remains unknown not only in the pancreatic cancer cells but also in normal human pancreatic duct epithelial (HPDE) cells. To investigate the regulation of  molecules including claudins in normal HPDE cells, we introduced the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene into HPDE cells in primary culture. The hTERT-transfected HPDE (hTERT-HPDE) cells were positive for the pancreatic duct epithelial markers such as CK7, CK19, and carbonic anhydrase isozyme 2 and expressed epithelial  molecules claudin-1, -4, -7 and, -18, occludin, JAM-A, ZO-1, ZO-2, and tricellulin. By treatment with fetal bovine serum or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA), the  molecules were up-regulated at the transcriptional level via a protein kinase C (PKC) signal pathway. A PKC-alpha inhibitor, Gö6976, prevented up-regulation of claudin-4 by TPA. Furthermore, a PKC-delta inhibitor, rottlerin, prevented up-regulation of claudin-7, occludin, ZO-1, and ZO-2 by TPA. By GeneChip analysis, up-regulation of the transcription factor ELF3 was observed in both fetal bovine serum- and TPA-treated cells. Treatment with small interfering RNAs of ELF3 prevented up-regulation of claudin-7 by TPA. These data suggest that  of normal HPDE cells were at least in part regulated via a PKC signal pathway by transcriptional control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10583506>Similar and differential behaviour between the nectin-afadin-ponsin and cadherin-catenin systems during the formation and disruption of the polarized junctional alignment in epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>We have recently identified a novel cell-cell adhesion system, named NAP system, which is localized at cadherin-based cell-cell adherens  (AJs). The NAP system is composed of at least nectin, afadin and ponsin. Nectin is an immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule. Afadin is an actin filament-binding protein which associates nectin with the actin cytoskeleton. Ponsin is an afadin-binding protein which furthermore binds to vinculin and provides a possible linkage of nectin-afadin to cadherin-catenin through vinculin. We compared here the behaviour of the NAP and cadherin-catenin systems during the formation and disruption of the polarized junctional alignment in epithelial cells.At the early stage of the formation of the polarized junctional alignment in MTD-1 A cells, primordial spot-like  were formed at the tips of thin cellular protrusions radiating from adjacent cells. Nectin, afadin, ponsin, cadherin and catenin were simultaneously recruited to these . As the cell polarization proceeded, the spot-like  were gradually fused to form belt-like AJs where all these proteins were concentrated. The disruption of cell-cell AJs in MDCK cells by culturing at a low Ca2+ concentration caused rapid endocytosis of cadherin, but not that of nectin or afadin. Addition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- to the cells formed a -like structure where nectin and afadin, but not cadherin, accumulated.These results indicate that the NAP and cadherin-catenin systems show similar and differential behaviour during the formation and disruption of the polarized junctional alignment in epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12471472>Lysophosphatidylcholine alters enterocyte monolayer permeability via a protein kinase C/Ca2+ mechanism.</a></h2><p>The activity of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) is elevated in the intestinal epithelia of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We recently reported that PLA(2) mediates the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysophosphatidylcholine (L-PC) when both are applied to the apical surface of cultures enterocyte monolayers, resulting in increased bacterial translocation (BT) and decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). However, the mechanism by which the converted L-PC affects  permeability (TJP) as reflected by decreased TEER is unknown. There are some reports that protein kinase C (PKC) or Ca(2+) mediate TJP in enterocyte monolayer models. To investigate whether the observed change in TJP was mediated via PKC or Ca(2+) in our Caco-2 monolayer model, human Caco-2 enterocytes were grown to confluence on porous filters in the apical chamber of a two-chamber cell culture system. The filters were then transferred to an Ussing chamber for precise, real-time resistance measurements. After 30 min equilibration, PC (0.1 or 1 mM) and L-PC (0.01, 0.1 or 1 mM), PMA 200 or 300 nM (phorbol 12-myristate 13-, PCK activator), or staurosporine 12 nM (PKC inhibitor) were added to the apical chamber and TEER was measured every 20 s for 2 h. The concentration of intracellular free Ca(2+) in the monolayers before and after treatment with L-PC (1 mM) was measured by fluorometry of whole monolayers using the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2. Neither PC at any dose nor the 0.01-mM L-PC dose had an effect on TEER. The 0.1-mM dose of L-PC had its greatest effect (47% +/- 3.5% reduction in TEER vs control) within 6 min following its addition, with TEER recovery to control levels (100%) at 2 h ( P < 0.05). The 1-mM dose of L-PC had its greatest effect (6% +/- 0.5% reduction in TEER vs control) within 3 min after its addition, but the TEER did not recover to control levels after 2 h of incubation ( P < 0.05). The addition of 200 or 300 nM PMA inhibited the observed recovery of TEER by L-PC. Conversely, the addition of 12 nM staurosporine enhanced TEER recovery to control levels. The 1-mM dose of L-PC increased the concentration of intracellular free Ca(2+) immediately after the addition of L-PC. These results suggest that L-PC alters TJP via a PKC/Ca(2+) interaction in our Caco-2 monolayer model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22160590>Protein kinase Cα inhibitor enhances the sensitivity of human pancreatic cancer HPAC cells to Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin via claudin-4.</a></h2><p>Protein kinase C (PKC) is overexpressed in cancer, including pancreatic cancer, compared with normal tissue. Moreover, PKCα is considered one of the biomarkers for the diagnosis of cancers. In several human cancers, the claudin  molecules are abnormally regulated and are thus promising molecular targets for diagnosis and therapy with Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE). In order to investigate the changes of  functions of claudins via PKCα activation in pancreatic cancer cells, the well-differentiated human pancreatic cancer cell line HPAC, with its highly expressed  molecules and well-developed barrier function, was treated with the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA). Treatment with TPA modified the activity of phosphoPKCα and caused an increase of the Snail family members Snail, Slug and Smad-interacting protein 1 and a decrease of E-cadherin. In HPAC cells treated with TPA, downregulation of claudin-1 and mislocalization of claudin-4 and occludin around the nuclei were observed, together with a decrease in the numbers of  strands and an increase in phosphorylation of claudin-4. The barrier function and the cytotoxicity of CPE were significantly decreased on TPA treatment. All such changes after TPA treatment were prevented by inhibitors of panPKC and PKCα. These findings suggest that, in human pancreatic cancer cells, PKCα activation downregulates  functions as a barrier and as a receptor of CPE via the modification of claudin-1 and -4 during epithelial to mesenchymal transition-like changes. PKCα inhibitors might represent potential therapeutic agents against human pancreatic cancer cells by use of CPE cytotoxicity via claudin-4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1722391>Electrophysiological responses to non-electrolytes in lingual nerve of rat and in lingual epithelia of dog.</a></h2><p>Epithelial and neural mechanisms underlying the trigeminal chemoreception of non-electrolytes were investigated in whole-nerve recordings from lingual nerve and in Ussing-chamber studies of isolated lingual epithelia. The non-electrolytes included menthol, amyl , phenethyl alcohol, toluene, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, hexanol and octanol. They produced different lingual nerve responses: methanol and ethanol only increased ongoing activity; longer-chain alcohols initially increased but then suppressed activity below baseline; phenethyl alcohol and toluene only suppressed activity. Their threshold concentrations for lingual nerve responses, with the exception of menthol, were proportional to the octanol:water partition coefficients of the stimuli. The threshold concentration for menthol was significantly lower than predicted by this coefficient. Calculation of the free energy of transfer from the threshold concentrations for the n-alcohols suggests that they undergo partition into a hydrophobic environment such as is found in lipid bilayers. Lanthanum chloride, which inhibited lingual nerve responses to hydrophilic compounds, presumably by blocking their diffusion across , did not inhibit responses to these non-electrolytes. At high concentrations, hexanol acted as an anaesthetic in that the lingual nerve no longer responded to thermal and chemical stimuli whereas ethanol, which only increased lingual nerve activity, did not inhibit those responses. Epithelial transport, as indicated by the short-circuit current (Isc) measured across tongues bathed in symmetrical solutions of Krebs-Henseleit buffer, was reversibly inhibited by ethanol, hexanol, octanol, phenyl ethanol and menthol. The stimulus concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of the Isc decreased with increasing octanol:water partition coefficient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10841351>Organization of choroid plexus epithelial and endothelial cell  and regulation of claudin-1, -2 and -5 expression by protein kinase C.</a></h2><p>Claudins are components of the  junctional complex in epithelial and endothelial cells.

Twenty-four hours after the phorbolester injection into the ventricle, claudin-1 immunoreactivity of the epithelial cells was increased and spread to the cytoplasm.

Cytochalasin D and phorbol 12-myristate 13- increased Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability and the appearance of particles in apical medium two- to threefold, as monitored by mannitol movement and AP activity, respectively. Blocking the apical secretory pathway by nocodazole or colchicine had no effect on either parameter. Estimation of SLP content demonstrated an increase in apical media particles similar to that determined by AP activity.

As the TPA exposure period is continued by chronically passaging cells in the presence of TPA, TER begins to recover. By 6 weeks of exposure, TER recovers to almost 50% of its initial value, suggesting that  (TJs) are recovering barrier function even in the continued presence of TPA. Between 6 and 8 weeks, TER then decreases a second time to approximately 20 to 40% of initial values, and TER values remain at this level for at least 18 weeks of exposure. Transepithelial (paracellular) fluxes of D-mannitol inversely correspond with TER changes. Across chronically treated cell sheets, rates are higher than those across control cell sheets, but lower than those across acutely treated cell sheets. The decrease of TER at 6-8 weeks coincides with the appearance of multilayered, polyp-like foci (PLFs) on the otherwise one cell layer thick epithelium. Electron microscopy shows that the electron-dense dye ruthenium red cannot penetrate across TJs of control cells but passes across all of the TJs of a cell sheet treated acutely with TPA. In chronically treated cultures, ruthenium red penetrates TJs between most cells of PLFs, but not TJs of adjacent morphologically normal epithelium. A clonal subline derived from cells of a PLF (clone PLF-A) is multilayered almost throughout and exhibits ruthenium red penetration across nearly all of its , monolayer or multilayer. Acute exposure of control cell sheets to TPA induces activation, translocation, and down-regulation of protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-alpha). In chronically TPA-treated and clone PLF-A cells, total PKC-alpha levels are reduced even further and almost all remaining PKC-alpha is found in the membrane-associated and Triton-insoluble fractions. Immunofluorescence shows that PKC-alpha expression is restricted to the PLFs in chronically TPA-treated cells and is more homogeneously distributed in clone PLF-A cultures. In summary, the data show that chronic treatment of epithelial cells with a tumor promoter induces the formation of abnormal cell architecture (PLFs) associated with increased leakiness of TJs and membrane translocation of PKC-alpha. Recovery of barrier function in portions of chronically TPA-treated cultures does not correlate with up-regulation of PKC-alpha nor translocation back to the cytosolic compartment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1722179>Effects of cyclic AMP and phorbol ester on transepithelial electrical resistance of Sertoli cell monolayers in two-compartment culture.</a></h2><p>The effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP [Bu)2cAMP) and phorbol ester (TPA), in the absence or presence of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or testosterone, on the development of  by immature rat Sertoli cells (Sc) were investigated in vitro using the two-compartment culture system. The  status was evaluated by repeated measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Untreated cell monolayers developed stable TER of approximately 120 omega cm2 during 3 days of culture. Continuous presence of FSH (200 ng/ml) from day 1 onward significantly increased the TER up to approximately 300 omega cm2 after a transient (24-36 h) delay. The initial delay was prolonged to 3-4 days by the addition of 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (MIX) (0.2 mM), whereas the subsequent increase of TER was significantly potentiated by the concomitant presence of testosterone (10 microM). Cholera toxin (CHT; 10 ng/ml) and forskolin (FR; 50 microM) mimicked these FSH effects. (Bu)2cAMP, at concentrations which maximally stimulated immunoactive inhibin secretion (100-500 microM), inhibited the initial TER increase and significantly decreased the TER level when added on days 1 and 5 of culture, respectively. In contrast, low concentrations of (Bu)2cAMP (4-20 microM) consistently stimulated the TER development, mimicking the stimulatory phase of FSH action. TPA (100 nM) alone had no effect on TER development, but potentiated the stimulatory effect of testosterone in a manner similar to FSH, CHT, FR or low concentrations of (Bu)2cAMP. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a concentration-dependent, dual effect of exogenous cAMP on the Sc function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29378000>Effect of individual SCFA on the epithelial barrier of sheep rumen under physiological and acidotic luminal pH conditions.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate whether individual short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) have a different potential to either regulate the formation of the ruminal epithelial barrier (REB) at physiological pH or to damage the REB at acidotic ruminal pH. Ruminal epithelia of sheep were incubated in Ussing chambers on their mucosal side in buffered solutions (pH 6.1 or 5.1) containing no SCFA (control), 30 mM of either , propionate or butyrate, or 100 mM . Epithelial conductance (Gt), short-circuit current (Isc), and fluorescein flux rates were measured over 7 h. Thereafter, mRNA and protein abundance, as well as localization of the  proteins claudin (Cldn)-1, -4, -7, and occludin were analyzed. At pH 6.1, butyrate increased Gt and decreased Isc, with additional decreases in claudin-7 mRNA and protein abundance (each P < 0.05) and disappearance of Cldn-7 immunosignals from the stratum corneum. By contrast, the mRNA abundance of Cldn-1 and/or Cldn-4 were upregulated by 30 mM propionate, 30 mM butyrate, or 100 mM  (P < 0.05), however, without coordinated changes in protein abundance. At luminal pH 5.1, neither Gt, Isc, nor TJ protein abundance was altered in the absence of SCFA; only fluorescein flux rates were slightly increased (P < 0.05) and fluorescein signals were no longer restricted to the stratum corneum. The presence of , propionate, or butyrate at pH 5.1 increased fluorescein flux rates and Gt, and decreased Isc (each P < 0.05). Protein abundance of Cldn-1 was decreased in all SCFA treatments but 30 mM butyrate; abundance of Cldn -4 and -7 was decreased in all SCFA treatments but 30 mM ; and abundance of occludin was decreased in all SCFA treatments but 30 mM propionate (each P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence staining of SCFA-treated tissues at pH 5.1 showed disappearance of Cldn-7, discontinuous pattern for Cldn-4 and blurring of occludin and Cldn-1 signals in  complexes. The fluorescein dye appeared to freely diffuse into deeper cell layers. The strongest increase in Gt and consistent decreases in the abundance and immunosignals of  proteins were observed with 100 mM  at pH 5.1. We conclude that SCFA may contribute differently to the REB formation at luminal pH 6.1 with possible detrimental effects of butyrate at 30 mM concentration. At luminal pH 5.1, all SCFA elicited REB damage with concentration appearing more critical than SCFA species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17234227>Iron supplement prevents lead-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier during rat development.</a></h2><p>Children are known to be venerable to lead (Pb) toxicity. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) in immature brain is particularly vulnerable to Pb insults. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that Pb exposure damaged the integrity of the BBB in young animals and iron (Fe) supplement may prevent against Pb-induced BBB disruption. Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Three groups of rats were exposed to Pb in drinking water containing 342 microg Pb/mL as Pb , among which two groups were concurrently administered by oral gavage once every other day with 7 mg Fe/kg and 14 mg Fe/kg as FeSO(4) solution as the low and high Fe treatment group, respectively, for 6 weeks. The control group received sodium  in drinking water. Pb exposure significantly increased Pb concentrations in blood by 6.6-folds (p<0.05) and brain tissues by 1.5-2.0-folds (p<0.05) as compared to controls. Under the electron microscope, Pb exposure in young animals caused an extensive extravascular staining of lanthanum nitrate in brain parenchyma, suggesting a leakage of cerebral vasculature. Western blot showed that Pb treatment led to 29-68% reduction (p<0.05) in the expression of occludin as compared to the controls. Fe supplement among Pb-exposed rats maintained the normal ultra-structure of the BBB and restored the expression of occludin to normal levels. Moreover, the low dose Fe supplement significantly reduced Pb levels in blood and brain tissues. These data suggest that Pb exposure disrupts the structure of the BBB in young animals. The increased BBB permeability may facilitate the accumulation of Pb. Fe supplement appears to protect the integrity of the BBB against Pb insults, a beneficial effect that may have significant clinical implications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10954417>Protein kinase C activation leads to dephosphorylation of occludin and  permeability increase in LLC-PK1 epithelial cell sheets.</a></h2><p>Activation of protein kinase C by exposure of LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells to 10(-7) M TPA, a tumor promoting phorbol ester, results in a rapid and sustained increase in paracellular permeability as evidenced by a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance. Occludin, the first identified transmembrane protein to be localized to the  of both epithelial and endothelial cells is thought play an important role in  barriers. Although transepithelial electrical resistance fell to less than 20% of initial values within 1 hour of TPA exposure, transmission electron microscopy showed no change in the gross morphology of the  of cells treated with 10(-7) M TPA for up to 2 hours. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a more rapid change in the membrane distribution of ZO-1 compared to occludin in the TPA-treated cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated that occludin levels in total cell lysates as well as cytosolic, membrane (Triton-X soluble) and cytoskeletal (Triton-X insoluble) fractions remained unchanged for at least 2 hours in cells treated with 10(-7) M TPA compared to their corresponding control cells. As the phosphorylation state of occludin is thought to be important in both  assembly and regulation, the effect of phorbol ester treatment on the phosphorylation of occludin was investigated. Surprisingly, activation of protein kinase C with 10(-7) M TPA resulted in a time-dependent decrease in threonine phosphorylation of occludin which correlated closely with the rapid decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance. This dephosphorylation of occludin, occurring after activation of a serine/threonine kinase by TPA, suggested that protein kinase C was not acting directly on this  target protein. If occludin dephosphorylation is involved in increasing  permeability, then protein kinase C is apparently further upstream in the signaling pathway regulating epithelial barrier function, with a downstream serine/threonine phosphatase acting upon occludin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23163616>Larazotide  in patients with coeliac disease undergoing a gluten challenge: a randomised placebo-controlled study.</a></h2><p>Coeliac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion, is managed by a gluten-free diet (GFD), which is difficult for many patients.

We found that treatment of polarized TBA B4-3 cells with a strong protein kinase C (PKC) agonist, phorbol 12-myristate-13- (PMA), induced 3-4 days later a transient interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) mRNA expression and vectorial IFN-gamma protein secretion toward the apical side of the monolayer. Exposure of TBA B4-3 cells to PMA first resulted in a rapid and profound disorganization of the monolayer structure mainly characterized by the appearance of multilayered polyp-like foci structures, a strong decrease of the TER, and a increase of permeability correlated with changes in the organization and localization of the TJ-associated proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) and filamentous actin (f-actin). After PMA removal, spontaneous return to the initial polarized monolayer state occurred, characterized by TER rising to prestimulation values, TJ protein relocalization, and multilayered cell structures fading. This return was strictly correlated with transient IFN-gamma gene induction. Our report represents the first example of an inducible expression of IFN-gamma by a polarized epithelial cell. After PMA treatment, the close correlation between establishment of cell polarity and IFN-gamma gene expression suggests a link between these phenomena. This also suggests a novel biological mechanism by which transient and reversible disorganization of a polarized monolayer of epithelial cells could trigger regulated expression of a cytokine gene by these cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329991>Effect of dietary graded resistant potato starch levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, and intestinal health in meat ducks.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary graded raw potato starch (RPS) levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, ileal  function, and cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentration in meat ducks from 1 to 35 D of age. This study included 2 experiments. In experiment (Exp.) 1, sixteen 35-day-old meat ducks were used to evaluate the AME of RPS by orogastric administration. Results showed the AME value of RPS on ducks is 2.76 kcal/g. In Exp. 2, a total of 600 one-day-old ducklings were randomly assigned to 5 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary treatments that included 0 (control), 6, 12, 18, and 24% RPS, respectively. Samples were collected at both of 14 and 35 D. Neither growth performance nor ileal parameters (length, weight, and pH) at both of 14 and 35 D was affected by dietary RPS. However, the mucosal thickness (14 D), villus height (except for 18% RPS at 14 D), and the villus height: crypt depth ratio (14 and 35 D) of the ileum were increased in the 12 and 18% RPS diets when compared to 0% RPS diet. Meanwhile, proinflammatory factors such as plasma interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 (14 D) reduced in 12% RPS diet and tumor necrosis factor α decreased in 12% (except for 14 D) and 18% RPS groups. When compared with the control group, diets with 18% RPS significantly increased mucin 2 gene expression at 14 D, and 12% RPS elevated the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins including Zonula occludens-1 and Claudin 1 (except for 14 D) in the ileal mucosa of birds. Furthermore, ducks fed 12% RPS diet had higher concentrations of , propionate, and butyrate in cecal digesta than other groups. These findings indicated that diets with 12 and/or 18% RPS increased the cecal SCFA concentration, which subsequently enhanced the  function and improved intestinal health in the ileum for 14 and 35-day-old meat ducks.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/126116>Retinal capillary : ultrastructural  artefacts induced by sodium ions and membrane reduction in streptozotocin diabetes.</a></h2><p>Retinal capillary  were analysed in normal and diabetic rats and in a human retina with the electron microscope. Diabetes mellitus was induced with streptozotocin. The retinae were fixed in Palade's osmium tetroxide containing sodium or calcium ions and block-stained in uranyl . With Ca-fixation, no significant difference in interendothelial cleft width was detected between retinal layers or between normal and diabetic retinae. Diabetes caused a narrowing of the clefts in the Na-fixed tissue X +/- SE, n=375; Normal: 78.6 +/- 300 A; Diabetic: 57.7 +/- 2.42 A; p less than 0.001). A significant correlation was found between cleft width and the length of the  or zonulae occludentes (p less than 0.001). In the nerve fibre layer of the Na-diabetic retina, where cleft narrowing was greatest, there was an increase in length of the zonulae occludentes from 22.8 +/- 2.2% to 41.6 +/- 3.7% (p less than 0.001). Ca-fixation prevented these changes, indicating that at least some zonulae occludentes were interendothelial extraction artefacts. In the normal retina, endothelial cell membrane thickness was greater with Ca- than Na-fixation (p less than 0.001). Diabetes caused a decrease in membrane thickness of Ca-fixed tissue (p less than 0.001). The diabetic decrease in membrane thickness may explain the increased fragility and increased permeability of diabetic capillaries. Calcium binding by endothelial cell membranes is of primary importance in anticoagulation which is defective in diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18032479>Transcriptional activation of the human claudin-18 gene promoter through two AP-1 motifs in PMA-stimulated MKN45 gastric cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Claudin-18 (CLDN18), a member of the claudin family of proteins that are structural components of , has two alternatively spliced variants, claudin-18a1 and claudin-18a2, which are highly expressed in lung and stomach, respectively. Downregulation of claudin-18a2 is associated with gastric cancers of an intestinal phenotype; however, the mechanisms regulating its expression have not been defined. Here, we found that phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) treatment of MKN45 human gastric cancer cell line increased claudin-18a2 expression. In addition, this study aimed to characterize the human CLDN18a2 promoter. Using reporter gene assays and deletion analysis, we mapped the critical promoter region of the PMA-stimulated claudin-18a2 expression to the -923/-286 region. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and mutational analyses revealed that two activator protein (AP)-1 binding sites played an important role in the expression of claudin-18a2 in PMA-stimulated MKN45 cells. Protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors suppressed the upregulation of claudin-18a2. These results indicate that the PKC/MAPK/AP-1 dependent pathway regulates claudin-18a2 expression in gastric cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16702264>Longer milking intervals alter mammary epithelial permeability and the Udder's ability to extract nutrients.</a></h2><p>Increasing the milking interval decreases milk yield and modifies milk composition. To gain a clearer understanding of the regulation of milk yield and composition, a study was conducted to establish the response curves of nutrient extraction by the mammary gland and mammary epithelial permeability in response to increasing milking intervals. Four multiparous lactating dairy cows were milked at 8-, 12-, 16-, or 24-h intervals over a period of 7 d using a Latin square design. Between the 8- and 24-h milking intervals, milk yield and milk protein levels fell curvilinearly from 38.2 to 29.2 kg/d and from 1,086 to 827 g/d, respectively. Milk fat yield decreased linearly from 1,475 to 1,235 g/d. Indicators of the opening of  increased linearly with increasing milking intervals: milk BSA increased from 148 to 207 mg/L and plasma lactose increased from 22.9 to 32.0 mg/L. The mammary gland's ability to extract nutrients decreased with increasing milking intervals. Extraction rates of glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and total glycerol decreased significantly (from 27.2 to 23.3%, from 42.3 to 34.4%, from 36.6 to 30.8% between 8- and 24-h milking intervals, respectively), and not significantly for alpha-amino nitrogen (from 23.2 to 20.0%). The extraction rate of  remained constant. Moreover, the extraction of milk fat precursors appeared to be less regulated than those of the precursors of milk protein and lactose, which could partly explain why milk yield and milk protein yield decreased more than milk fat yield. The arteriovenous differences of beta-hydroxybutyrate and total glycerol remained constant, whereas those of glucose decreased significantly from 0.98 to 0.87 +/- 0.05 mmol/L and not significantly from 0.74 to 0.64 +/- 0.12 mmol/L for alpha-amino nitrogen. As a result, the mammary gland's ability to extract nutrients appears to be downregulated explaining partly the decrease in daily milk yield observed in response to increased milking intervals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30154787>Butyrate and Dietary Soluble Fiber Improve Neuroinflammation Associated With Aging in Mice.</a></h2><p>Aging results in chronic systemic inflammation that can alter neuroinflammation of the brain. Specifically, microglia shift to a pro-inflammatory phenotype predisposing them to hyperactivation upon stimulation by peripheral immune signals. It is proposed that certain nutrients can delay brain aging by preventing or reversing microglial hyperactivation. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced primarily by bacterial fermentation of fiber in the colon, has been extensively studied pharmacologically as a histone deacetylase inhibitor and serves as an attractive therapeutic candidate, as butyrate has also been shown to be anti-inflammatory and improve memory in animal models. In this study, we demonstrate that butyrate can attenuate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in microglia in aged mice. It is still not fully understood, however, if an increase in butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut as a consequence of a diet high in soluble fiber could affect microglial activation during aging. Adult and aged mice were fed either a 1% cellulose (low fiber) or 5% inulin (high fiber) diet for 4 weeks. Findings indicate that mice fed inulin had an altered gut microbiome and increased butyrate, , and total SCFA production. In addition, histological scoring of the distal colon demonstrated that aged animals on the low fiber diet had increased inflammatory infiltrate that was significantly reduced in animals consuming the high fiber diet. Furthermore, gene expression of inflammatory markers, epigenetic regulators, and the microglial sensory apparatus (i.e., the sensome) were altered by both diet and age, with aged animals exhibiting a more anti-inflammatory microglial profile on the high fiber diet. Taken together, high fiber supplementation in aging is a non-invasive strategy to increase butyrate levels, and these data suggest that an increase in butyrate through added soluble fiber such as inulin could counterbalance the age-related microbiota dysbiosis, potentially leading to neurological benefits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23519560>Dysregulation of pathways involved in the processing of cancer and microenvironment information in MCA + TPA transformed C3H/10T1/2 cells.</a></h2><p>The two-stage cell transformation assay is an in vitro model cell culture system to identify the ability of chemicals to act as initiators or promoters of cell transformation and also to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of chemically induced morphological and neoplastic cell transformation. The global gene expression profiles of 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) + 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA)-transformed C3H/10T1/2 cells are not known. Therefore, we have investigated the global transcriptional profile of MCA + TPA-transformed C3H10T1/2 cells using an 8 × 60 k probe microarray. The study revealed a differential regulation of pathways and gene expressions. Multifold dysregulation was seen in pathways of cancer, phagosomal activity, and tumor cell microenvironment information processing systems, notably the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, actin cytoskeleton regulation, , axon guidance, and cell adhesion molecules. The genes FGF1, EIF4E1B, MAGI1, and GRIA3 showed upregulation; these encoded the pluripotent fibroblast growth factor, the translation initiation factor, the  scaffolding protein, and the antiapoptotic as well as the enhancer of proliferation and migration, respectively. The genes CXCL7/CXCL5/CXCL12, H2DMB1, and HSPA1A showed downregulation; these encoded the chemotactic agent protein, the protein involved in MHC class II antigen processing/presentation or participating in cell adhesion/phagosomal activity/autoimmune disorder, and the chaperone protein stabilizing the existing as well as newly translated cytosolic/organelle proteins against aggregation, respectively. By loss or gain of function, these dysregulated genes apparently seem to reprogram cells for apoptosis or proliferation and support their transformation into the tumor cell phenotype. The observed molecular changes can be seen as molecular signatures of transformed cells and can be of use as objective evidences to C3H/10T1/2 cell transformation assay in investigations on the carcinogenic potential of chemicals and their mechanism of actions using in vitro carcinogenesis method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302308>Effects of starter feeding on caecal mucosal bacterial composition and expression of genes involved in immune and tight junctions in pre-weaned twin lambs.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to explore the effects of starter feeding on caecal mucosal bacterial composition and the expression of genes involved in immune and tight junctions in pre-weaned lambs. Six pairs of new-born twin lambs were selected. From 10 days of age, one lamb of each pair received ewe's milk only (M group, n = 6), while the other one was fed ewe's milk plus starter feed (M + S group, n = 6). At 56 days of age, the lambs were sacrificed, and then cecum digesta was collected to measure pH values and concentrations of volatile fatty acid (VFA), and caecal mucosa were collected to determine the changes in bacterial communities and the mRNA expression of cytokines, toll-like receptors (TLRs) and tight junction proteins. The results showed the body weight and average daily gain were not significantly different between both groups. Starter feeding significantly (P < 0.05) increased the concentrations of propionate and butyrate; the proportions of , propionate and butyrate to total concentrations of VFA; and decreased the ratio of  to propionate in caecal contents. Principal coordinate analysis showed that samples from the M + S group could be distinguished from those from the M group; starter feeding also increased the diversity of caecal mucosal bacteria. At the genus level, starter feeding significantly (FDR < 0.05) increased the relative abundance of Alistipes, Parabacteroides, Parasutterella and Butyricimonas, and caused a decreasing trend (FDR < 0.10) in the relative abundance of Campylobacter and Helicobacter. The real-time PCR results showed that starter feeding significantly (FDR < 0.05) decreased the relative mRNA expression level of IL-12, TNF-α and TLR4 and increased the relative mRNA expression level of claudin-4. These results indicate that starter feeding altered caecal mucosal bacterial communities and decreased the expression of inflammatory factors, which may be beneficial in alleviating the weaning stress of lambs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Both EGF and TPA stimulated dose-dependently the cellular incorporation of [3H]thymidine, which maximally (at 10 ng/ml EGF for 48 h) corresponded to a 65% increase of the DNA content. The EGF-treated cells proliferated mainly within the original monolayer, which became folded due to the increased cell number; clusters of epithelial cells also assembled between the monolayer and the filter. Although the transepithelial potential difference was reduced, from 15-30 mV in controls to 2-10 mV, the epithelial barrier function was maintained (RTE 1-3.10(3) omega.cm2; impermeability to [3H]inulin). EGF did not change the ultrastructural polarity of the plasma membrane or the distinct distribution of ZO-1 and cadherin immunoreactivities to , but cytoplasmic cadherin present in controls disappeared after EGF. In cultures acutely depleted of extracellular Ca2+ EGF pretreatment for 48 h antagonized the preventive effect of thyrotropin on paracellular leakage and loss of cell-cell adhesion. TPA (0.1 microM) induced a temporary barrier dysfunction (maximal after 24 h) accompanied by pronounced alterations of cell shape and actin-based cytoskeleton, dissociation of junctional cadherin, and shedding of cells into the apical medium. In long-term (2-5 days) TPA-treated cultures the epithelial morphotype and barrier function recovered. The combined stimulation with EGF and TPA caused a persistent derangement of the cell layer including attenuation of ZO-1 at cell-cell contacts, paracellular leakage of [3H]inulin, and cell detachment. We conclude that EGF is able to release porcine thyroid epithelial cells from contact inhibition of growth along with intact cell polarity and . Yet, when acting together with phorbol ester EGF provokes a lasting morphological transformation. Impaired positive control of Ca(2+)-dependent cell-cell adhesion in EGF-treated cultures suggests a latent defect with possible transforming potential in the cadherin-based regulation of the junctional complex.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17945025>Changes in the distribution pattern of Claudin  proteins during the progression of mouse skin tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Despite the fact that morphological and physiological observations suggest that the  (TJ)-based permeability barrier is modified/disrupted in tumorigenesis, the role of members of the Claudin (Cldn) family of TJ proteins is not well-understood. Using a well-established two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model, we investigated the temporal and spatial changes in expression of those Cldns that we have previously demonstrated to be important in epidermal differentiation and the formation of the epidermal permeability barrier, i.e., Cldn1, Cldn6, Cldn11, Cldn12 and Cldn18.The lower dorsal backskin of mice was treated topically with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA; 0.25 mg/ml in acetone) and following a 10-day incubation period, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13- (TPA; 25 microg/ml in acetone) was applied three times a week to the same area. Backskin samples were dissected 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks after the initiation of the experimental protocol and immunohistochemistry was performed on sections using antibodies against the following: Cldn1, Cldn6, Cldn11, Cldn12, Cldn18, Ki67 and CD3.Our data indicate that along with the changes in epidermal cell morphology and differentiation that occur during tumor formation, there is a dramatic change in Cldn distribution consistent with cell polarity and barrier selectivity changes. Specifically, in the early stages of DMBA/TPA treatment, the suprabasal-specific Cldns occupy an expanded zone of expression corresponding to an increased number of suprabasal epidermal cell layers. As tumorigenesis progressed, the number of suprabasal epidermal layers positive for Cldn6, Cldn11, Cldn12 and Cldn18 was reduced, especially in the lower strata of the expanded suprabasal zone. In addition, a variably reduced cell membrane association of those differentiation-specific Cldns was observed, especially within the infiltrating epidermal structures. In contrast, Cldn1 (which is normally expressed in all the living layers of the epidermis) remained restricted to the cell membrane throughout the tumorigenesis protocol. However commencing 2 weeks after treatment there was a marked decrease in the number of Cldn1-positive basal cells, and the zone of Cldn1-null epidermal cells was expanded up into the lower stratified epidermis throughout the progression of DMBA/TPA treatment. In addition, there was no Cldn1 localization in the infiltrating epidermal structures of the tumorigenic epidermis.This is the first demonstration of the changes in Cldn expression in the progression of DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumors; however further investigation into the molecular mechanisms regulating the observed changes in barrier selectivity during tumorigenesis is required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11210226>Multiparametric microsensor chips for screening applications.</a></h2><p>The identification of drug targets for pharmaceutical screening can be greatly accelerated by gene databases and expression studies.

Cytoskeletal inhibitors, cytochalasin E (20 mumol.L-1) or colchicine (0.5 mmol.L-1), when present in mucosal, serosal, or in both mediums, significantly increase unidirectional mannitol fluxes. Exposure of mucosal and serosal intestinal surface to 10 mmol.L-1 theophylline or 1 mmol.L-1 cyclic AMP analogue for raising the intracellular cAMP enhances paracellular permeability. In Ca(2+)-free physiological medium passive permeability strongly increases. Alterations of cytosolic Ca2+ levels induced by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (20 mumol.L-1) or by 0.3 mmol.L-1 TMB-8, a Ca2+ releasing inhibitor from the intracellular stores, enhance mannitol flux. Addition of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-, which activates protein kinase C (PKC), also induces a large increase in the intestinal permeability to mannitol. These results provide evidence that  and consequently epithelial paracellular permeability can be physiologically controlled by intracellular mediators (Ca2+, cAMP, and PKC) probably through modulation of the cytoskeleton activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16574992>Chronic PKC-beta2 activation in HT-29 Cl.19a colonocytes prevents cAMP-mediated ion secretion by inhibiting apical membrane CFTR targeting.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effects of chronically applied PKC-stimulating phorbol esters on subcellular CFTR expression and localization in polarized HT-29 Cl.19A monolayers. Modulation of PKC activity with the PKC-beta-specific agonist 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20- (DOPPA) or nonisoform-selective PMA altered monolayer CFTR immunofluorescence. A decrease in the CFTR signal within the luminal cellular pole was noted with both phorbol esters. Volumetric analysis of the intracellular CFTR signal revealed that both compounds promoted CFTR accumulation into punctate vesicle-like structures found adjacent to the cellular  [labeled with zona occludens (ZO)-1 antibody], extending basally (DOPPA) into the cell. Puncta were more frequent with DOPPA and larger in size with PMA. DOPPA also promoted ZO-1 accumulation at tricellular corners associated with enhanced CFTR puncta number. The observed loss of CFTR immunofluorescence signal induced by low-dose PMA was related to CFTR sequestration into fewer cytoplasmic puncta and correlated with larger increases in PKC substrate phosphorylation. Both phorbol esters downregulated steady-state cellular CFTR mRNA levels by 70%. However, the effects of DOPPA and PMA were largely independent of CFTR biosynthesis: expression levels were 80-85% of control, and the glycosylation status of immunoprecipitated protein remained largely unchanged. Thus changes in cellular CFTR localization correlated with our companion study showing that PMA-induced inhibition of transcellular cAMP-dependent short-circuit current (ISC) was accompanied by cytoplasmic PKC-beta2 accumulation and modest activation of PKC-beta1 and PKC-epsilon. The inhibitory effect of DOPPA on ISC was related solely to increased cytoplasmic PKC-beta2 levels. Thus PKC-beta2 is hypothesized to participate in the regulation of CFTR apical plasma membrane targeting within the constitutive cellular biosynthetic pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1701980>Expression of normal and cystic fibrosis phenotypes by continuous airway epithelial cell lines.</a></h2><p>Continuous epithelial cell lines from individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and normal controls are required to understand the genetic and cellular defects in CF.

The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of SCFAs on ethanol-induced  dysfunction and to examine the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a possible mechanism using Caco-2 monolayers. The monolayers were treated apically with butyrate (2, 10, or 20 mmol/L), propionate (4, 20, or 40 mmol/L), or  (8, 40, or 80 mmol/L) for 1 h before ethanol (40 mmol/L) for 3 h.   was analyzed by measurement of transepithelial resistance and permeation of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran. Distribution of the tight junction (TJ) proteins zona occludens-1, occludin, and filamentous-actin (F-actin) was examined by immunofluorescence. Metabolic stress was determined by measuring oxidative stress, mitochondrial , and ATP using dichlorofluorescein diacetate, dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, and bioluminescence assay, respectively. AMPK was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA), and its activity was assessed by a cell-based ELISA. Exposure to ethanol significantly impaired   compared with controls (P < 0.0001), disrupted TJ and F-actin cytoskeleton integrity, and induced metabolic stress. However, pretreatment with 2 mmol/L butyrate, 4 mmol/L propionate, and 8 mmol/L  significantly alleviated the ethanol-induced  dysfunction, TJ and F-actin disruption, and metabolic stress compared with ethanol-exposed monolayers (P < 0.0001). The promoting effects on   were abolished by inhibiting AMPK using either compound C or siRNA. These observations indicate that SCFAs exhibit protective effects against ethanol-induced  disruption via AMPK activation, suggesting a potential for SCFAs as prophylactic and/or therapeutic factors against ethanol-induced gut leakiness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2537298>Protein kinase C activation has dissimilar effects on sodium-coupled uptakes in renal proximal tubular cells in primary culture.</a></h2><p>Protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) was shown to be present in renal brush border membranes. To evaluate the influence of protein kinase C activation on three apical transport systems, we studied the effect of phorbol myristate  (PMA) and of two diacylglycerol analogs, oleoylacetylglycerol and dioctanoylglycerol, on sodium-dependent uptakes of phosphate (Pi), L-alanine, and alpha-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (MGP), as well as on specific phlorizin binding, in cultured rabbit proximal tubular cells. PMA, at 100 ng/ml, decreased the Vmax of Pi and MGP uptake by 30 and 17%, respectively, but not that of alanine uptake. None of the Km values were affected. PMA also decreased the number of phlorizin binding sites by 40%. PMA-induced inhibition of Pi and MGP uptake was time- and concentration-dependent, was mimicked by oleoylacetylglycerol, dioctanoylglycerol, and the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor R59022, and was reversed by the protein kinase C antagonist 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7). The effects of PMA persisted in the presence of amiloride and dimethyl amiloride, and were potentiated by Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Opening of  blunted subsequent PMA-induced decrease of MGP uptake, but not of Pi uptake. It is concluded that: (i) activation of protein kinase C does not affect similarly Na-Pi, Na-hexose, and Na-alanine cotransport; and (ii) different pathways are likely to be involved in the observed effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23525277>Amyloid-β-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion is associated with retinal pigment epithelial barrier disruption.</a></h2><p>Local and chronic inflammation induced by amyloid-β (Aβ) plays a central role in the development of age-related macular degeneration. The retina is an immune-privileged site due to local tissue barrier. Yet, the manner by which immune cells pass through this barrier and accumulate in the retina remains unclear. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) induce barrier disruption via proteolysis of epithelial  (TJ) proteins. We hypothesized that Aβ-induced MMP secretion causes disruption of epithelial barrier integrity. To test this hypothesis, human adult retinal pigment epithelial (haRPE) cells were exposed to Aβ, and the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was detected using gelatin zymography. To demonstrate the key role of MMPs in modulating epithelial barrier structure, the MMP agonist 4-aminophenylmercuric  (APMA), an MMP inhibitor (GM6001) and siRNA against MMP-9 were employed for comparison. We found that MMP-9, secreted by Aβ- or APMA-stimulated cells, mediated low transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and high transepithelial permeability by disrupting TJ proteins. However, these alterations were reduced by the MMP inhibitor GM6001 or by silencing of the MMP-9 gene. Our findings suggest that the degradation of TJ proteins such as zonula occludens-1, occludin and F-actin by MMP-9 secreted by Aβ-stimulated cells constitutes an important mechanism in the breakdown of the barrier which contributes to chronic inflammation in the retina of age-related macular degeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30973755>Dynamic changes in rumen fermentation and bacterial community following rumen fluid transplantation in a sheep model of rumen acidosis: implications for rumen health in ruminants.</a></h2><p>Over the years, rumen fluid transplantation (RT) has been successfully applied to treat acute rumen acidosis in ruminants, but how it functions in the ruminal microbial homeostasis and host function remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the dynamic changes of rumen fermentation and bacterial communities following RT and its beneficial effects on rumen epithelial morphology and function in a sheep model of rumen acidosis. The results showed that RT resulted in dynamic changes in rumen fermentation and increased the concentrations of total volatile fatty acid, , propionate, and butyrate, but it decreased the levels of lactate and LPS in the rumen. Illumina MiSeq Sequencing data showed that RT facilitated rapid rebuilt of ruminal bacterial homeostasis (8 d in control  2 d in RT) from a markedly dysbiotic acidosis state to a healthy level (similar with those of donors). At the genus level, RT increased the relative abundance of unclassified , unclassified , unclassified , and . Additionally, RT also accelerated recovery of the predicted metagenomic function of ruminal bacteria. Rumen papillae morphology results showed that RT alleviated the damage of rumen epithelia induced by acute rumen acidosis and increased the length of rumen papillae. Furthermore, real-time PCR results showed that RT modulated mRNA expression of genes related to cytokines and  in the rumen epithelia.

The blood-retinal barrier required for normal retinal function is compromised in diabetic retinopathy, causing retinal vascular leakage. Previously, we demonstrated the ability of Sac-0601[((2R,3S)-3-acetoxy-6-((3S,10R,13R,17R)-10,13-dimethyl-17-((R)-6-methylheptan-2-yl)-2,3,4,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17-tetradecahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-3-yloxy)-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)methyl ], a pseudo-sugar derivative of cholesterol, to increase survival of retinal endothelial cells. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of Sac-0601 to prevent retinal vascular leakages in vitro and in vivo. Sac-0601 treatment blocked VEGF-induced formation of actin stress fibers and stabilized the cortical actin ring in retinal endothelial cells. It also inhibited degradation of occludin, an important  protein, and blocked VEGF-induced disruption of its linear pattern at the cell border. The [(14)C] sucrose permeability assay demonstrated that Sac-0601 was able to prevent VEGF-induced retinal endothelial permeability. The compound inhibited the vascular leakage in retina of mice intravitreally injected with VEGF. And it also significantly reduced the leakage in retina of diabetic retinopathy mice model. Taken together, our findings suggest the potential therapeutic usefulness of Sac-0601 for retinal vascular permeability diseases.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To examine the role of specific PKC isoforms in this process we have created modified LLC-PK1 subclones that express wild-type and dominant negative versions of PKC-alpha under control of the tetracycline-responsive expression system. Overexpression of wild-type PKC-alpha rendered the cells more sensitive to the effects of TPA on transepithelial permeability as measured by loss of transepithelial resistance across the cell sheet. Conversely, expression of a dominant negative PKC-alpha rendered the cells more resistant to the effects of TPA as measured both by loss of transepithelial resistance as well as cell scattering. The properties of both subclones could be modulated by the addition of tetracycline, which suppressed the effect of the exogenous genes. These results indicate that the alpha isoform of PKC is at least one of the isoforms that regulate  and other cell-cell  of LLC-PK1 epithelia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7733936>The protein kinase C inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide, inhibits the TPA-induced but not the TNF-induced increase in LLC-PK1 transepithelial permeability.</a></h2><p>The transepithelial paracellular permeability of an epithelium formed by LLC-PK1 cells increases upon activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by the phorbol ester tumor promoter, TPA, or in response to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). Until recently, however, we have not been able to inhibit the permeability effects of TPA or TNF using any of the currently available serine-threonine kinase inhibitors. In this study we report the treatment of epithelial cell sheets with the selective PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide, GF109203X, completely prevents the TPA-induced but not the TNF-alpha induced increase in  permeability. While PKC-alpha still translocates from the cytosol to the membrane of TPA-stimulated epithelial cells overall PKC activity in the membrane fraction is markedly reduced in the presence of GFX.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7593331>Phosphorylation of the  protein cingulin and the effects of protein kinase inhibitors and activators in MDCK epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>In previous studies we have shown that protein kinase inhibitors and extracellular calcium can affect dramatically the assembly of  (TJ) and the localization of the TJ protein cingulin at sites of cell-cell contact in renal epithelial (MDCK) cells. To characterize in more detail the relationships between kinase activity and  organization, we have studied the effects of the protein kinase C agonist phorbol myristate  (PMA) on the intracellular localization of cingulin, E-cadherin, desmoplakin and actin microfilaments in confluent MDCK monolayers. To study cingulin phosphorylation, MDCK cells were metabolically labelled with [32P]orthophosphate and immunoprecipitates were prepared with anti-cingulin antiserum. We show here that cingulin is phosphorylated in vivo on serine, and its specific phosphorylation is not significantly changed by treatment of confluent MDCK monolayers with PMA, with the protein kinase inhibitor H-7, or with the calcium chelator EGTA. Metabolic labeling with a pulse of [35S]methionine/cysteine showed that at normal extracellular calcium net cingulin biosynthesis was not affected by PMA or H-7. During  assembly by calcium switch, H-7 did not change the specific phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated cingulin, however, it prevented the increase in the amount of cingulin in the immunoprecipitates, suggesting that H-7 may block  assembly by interfering with cellular processes that lead to the accumulation and stabilization of TJ proteins at sites of cell-cell contact.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9130471>Different size limitations for increased transepithelial paracellular solute flux across phorbol ester and tumor necrosis factor-treated epithelial cell sheets.</a></h2><p>By observing increases in the transepithelial paracellular permeability of a range of radiolabeled solutes and electron dense dyes, changes in molecular sieving caused by the cytokine, TNF (tumor necrosis factor), and the phorbol ester, TPA (12-0-tetra-decanoylphorbol-13-), were characterized. Using 14C-labeled mannitol (mw 182), raffinose (mw 504), PEG (polyethylene glycol; mw 4000), and dextran (mw 10,000, 70,000 and 2,000,000), the transepithelial flux rates of these compounds were determined at the peak of the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) changes caused by these two agents. TNF treatment resulted in increased permeability across LLC-PK1 epithelial cell sheets only to relatively small solutes, with an upper limit of approximately 4,000 mw. The low molecular weight "ceiling" for the TNF-treated epithelium is further evidence against TNF increasing transepithelial permeability by means of inducing nonspecific, microscopic "holes" in the epithelium, for which a "ceiling" would not exist. TPA treatment increases transepithelial paracellular permeability to a much broader range of solutes, extending well beyond 2 million mw. Transmission electron micrographs provide evidence that even the electron-dense dye complex, ruthenium red, can cross  of TPA-treated cell sheets. However, cationic ferritin cannot cross  of TPA-treated cell sheets. This shows that there is an upper limit to solutes able to cross TPA-treated cell sheets, but that this upper limit will include most proteins, which would then be able to cross tumor promoter-exposed (protein kinase C-activated) epithelial layers at accelerated rates. The biomedical implications for a high molecular weight cutoff in tumor promoter action in epithelial carcinogenesis, and for a low molecular weight cutoff in cytokine-induced epithelial apoptosis in inflammation, are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19447895>Claudin-4 augments alveolar epithelial barrier function and is induced in acute lung injury.</a></h2><p>Intact alveolar barrier function is associated with better outcomes in acute lung injury patients; however, the regulation of alveolar epithelial paracellular transport during lung injury has not been extensively investigated. This study was undertaken to determine whether changes in  claudin expression affect alveolar epithelial barrier properties and to determine the mechanisms of altered expression. In anesthetized mice exposed to ventilator-induced lung injury, claudin-4 was specifically induced among  structural proteins. Real-time PCR showed an eightfold increase in claudin-4 expression in the lung injury model. To examine the role of this protein in barrier regulation, claudin-4 function was inhibited with small interfering RNA (siRNA) and a blocking peptide derived from the binding domain of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE(BD)). Inhibition of claudin-4 decreased transepithelial electrical resistance but did not alter macromolecule permeability in primary rat and human epithelial cells. In mice, CPE(BD) decreased air space fluid clearance >33% and resulted in pulmonary edema during moderate tidal volume ventilation that did not induce edema in control peptide-treated mice. In vitro phorbol ester induced a ninefold increase in claudin-4 expression that was dependent on PKC activation and the JNK MAPK pathway. These data establish that changes in alveolar epithelial claudin expression influence paracellular transport, alveolar fluid clearance rates, and susceptibility to pulmonary edema. We hypothesize that increased claudin-4 expression early in acute lung injury represents a mechanism to limit pulmonary edema and that the regulation of alveolar epithelial claudin expression may be a novel target for acute lung injury therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7532273>Responses of the fetal cerebral vasculature to prenatal cytotoxic brain damage.</a></h2><p>Prenatal exposure to the drug methylazoxy-methanol  (MAM Ac) has been commonly used as an experimental model of prenatal cytotoxic brain damage. We have examined the effects of this prenatal brain damage on the development of vasculature in the fetal neocortex, because vasculature is likely to play an important role in fetal brain repair. Pregnant Wistar strain rats received either MAM Ac (25 mg/kg) or saline on embryonic day (E) 13 by IP injection. At E15, E17, E19, and and E21, the rats were overdosed with pentobarbitone (100 mg/kg) and fetuses removed for paraffin embedding, lectin histochemistry, and electron microscopy. For lectin histochemistry, sections were exposed to a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated B4 isolectin from Griffonia simplicifolia. Fetuses exposed to MAM Ac showed significant deficits in cortical vessel branch point density at E15 and E17 (46% and 20%, respectively). There were also significant reductions in stem vessel density at these ages (34% and 26%, respectively) among MAM Ac exposed animals, but there were no differences in growing tip density, capillary internal diameter, or stem vessel internal diameter. The only consistent differences between the two groups at the electron microscope level were an increase in vacuolisation and an irregular luminal surface in MAM Ac animals at E15.  formation, basement membrane formation, and loss of fenestrations were not delayed in experimental animals. The results indicate that there is no increase in angiogenic activity coincident with the fetal neocortical repair that follows MAM Ac induced damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8253858>Lipid synthesis and secretion by primary cultures of rat mammary epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Lipid synthesis and secretion was measured in primary rat mammary epithelial cells cultured on basement matrix in medium supplemented with lactogenic hormones. The cells grew and differentiated to form alveolar-like structures reminiscent of lactating mammary gland. They synthesized abundant triacylglycerol, containing fatty acids characteristic of rat milk (C10:0-C14:0), using 14C-glucose, 14C-oleic acid or 14C-glycerol as precursors. Basal levels of triacylglycerol secretion were measured using 14C-oleic acid labeling; 1.3 +/- 0.3% of the labeled cellular triacylglycerol was secreted into the medium in 24 hours. Secreted lipid droplets were surrounded by a bilayer membrane with an electron-dense inner coat characteristic of fat globules secreted by the mammary gland. The rate of triglycerol secretion was increased to 998 +/- 98% of control (P < 0.01) by the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) in combination with staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor. Several other protein kinase inhibitors, when combined with PMA, also markedly stimulated secretion. Effective protein kinase inhibitors included sphingosine (has diverse cellular effects including the inhibition of protein kinase C; 13-fold increase in secretion), and KT5823 (a cGMP dependent protein kinase inhibitor; 5-fold increase). KT5720 (a cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor) did not alter secretion. Kinase inhibitors were effective only in the presence of a phorbol ester. 4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, a phorbol ester which does not activate protein kinase C (PKC), could substitute for PMA. Lipid release was not mediated by disruption of cell-cell , as EGTA did not release lipid. Based on these observations we suggest that two signals are needed to enable or stimulate lipid secretion in cultured rat mammary epithelial cells: 1) inhibition of a protein kinase and 2) a PKC-independent effect of phorbol ester. We have, for the first time, characterized a cell culture model suitable for studying lipid synthesis and secretion by mammary epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8556986>Effect of cotton, hemp, and flax dust extracts on lung permeability in the guinea pig.</a></h2><p>Byssinosis is an occupational lung disease in textile mill workers exposed to the respirable dusts of cotton, hemp, and flax. This study investigated the influence of aqueous extracts from these dusts on overall lung permeability in the guinea pig as an index of respiratory epithelial damage. Lung permeability was assessed by absorption into blood from the lung of inhaled technetium-99m diethylenetriamine penta- (Tc-DTPA) using gamma-scintigraphy. The half-life for Tc-DTPA absorption (t1/2) was significantly reduced following a 4-week inhalation treatment with cotton, hemp, or flax dust extracts when compared to saline control. There was at least a partial return to normal permeability 7 days after stopping treatment. A single inhalation of extract did not affect the t1/2, but increased the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 24 h postexposure. Neutrophil migration into the airspaces therefore appeared to precede the increased lung permeability. Long-term exposure was not associated with respiratory epithelial shedding, suggesting that the increased permeability reflects a loss of epithelial  integrity arising from repeated exposure to as yet undefined agents in these dusts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21381080>Transcriptional regulation of claudin-18 via specific protein kinase C signaling pathways and modification of DNA methylation in human pancreatic cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Since claudin-18 (Cldn18) is overexpressed in precursor lesion PanIN and pancreatic duct carcinoma, it serves as a diagnostic marker and a target of immunotherapy. The stomach isoform of Cldn18, Cldn18a2 is regulated via a PKC/MAPK/AP-1-dependent pathway in PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA)-stimulated gastric cancer cells. However, little is known about how Cldn18 is regulated, not only in pancreatic duct carcinoma but also in normal human pancreatic duct epithelial cells (HPDE cells). In the present study, four pancreatic cancer cell lines, HPAF-II, HPAC, PANC-1 and BXPC3, and hTERT-HPDE cells in which the hTERT gene was introduced into HPDE cells in primary culture, were treated with TPA. In all human pancreatic cancer cell lines and hTERT-HPDE cells, Cldn18 mRNA indicated as Cldn18a2 was markedly induced by TPA and in well- or moderately differentiated human pancreatic cancer cells HPAF-II and HPAC and hTERT-HPDE cells, the protein was also strongly increased. The upregulation of Cldn18 by TPA in human pancreatic cancer cell lines was prevented by inhibitors of PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCα, whereas the upregulation of Cldn18 by TPA in hTERT-HPDE cells was prevented by inhibitors of PKCδ, PKCθ, and PKCα. Furthermore, a CpG island was identified within the coding sequence of the Cldn18 gene and treatment with the demethylating agent 5-azadeoxycytidine enhanced upregulation of Cldn18 by TPA in HPAF-II and HPAC, but not hTERT-HPDE cells. Our findings suggest that in human pancreatic cancer cells, Cldn18 is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level via specific PKC signaling pathways and modified by DNA methylation.Copyright © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27375258>Exploitation of Leuconostoc mesenteroides strains to improve shelf life, rheological, sensory and functional features of prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica L.) fruit puree.</a></h2><p>Strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified from raw prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica L.). Five autochthonous strains were selected based on the kinetics of growth and acidification on prickly pear fruit juice, and the capacity to synthesize exo-polysaccharides. All selected Leuc. mesenteroides strains showed an in vitro mucilage-degrading capability. A protocol for processing and storage of fermented prickly pear fruit puree (FP) was set up. Unstarted FP and chemically acidified FP were used as the controls. Starters grew and remained viable at elevated cell numbers during 21 days of storage at 4 °C. Contaminating Enterobacteriaceae and yeasts were found only in the controls. Viscosity and serum separation distinguished started FP compared to the controls. Colour parameters, browning index, sensory attributes, antimicrobial activity, vitamin C and betalains levels were positively affected by lactic acid fermentation. Increase of free radical scavenging activity in ethyl  soluble extract suggested an effect of selected strains on phenolic profiles. Started FP markedly inhibited the inflammatory status of Caco-2/TC7 cells, and also contributed to maintaining the integrity of . Started FP scavenged the reactive oxygen species generated by H2O2 on Caco-2 cells. All selected strain variously affected the immunomodulatory activity towards anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p></html>
