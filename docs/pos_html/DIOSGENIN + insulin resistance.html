Treatments with DSG, 5-MOP, and their combination were performed, respectively. The result showed that the incubation of HepG2 cells with high concentration insulin markedly decreased glucose consumption and glycogen synthesis. However, treatment with DSG, 5-MOP, or their combination significantly reversed the condition and increased the phosphorylated expression of estrogen receptor-α (ERα), sarcoma (Src), Akt/protein kinase B, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 (PI3Kp85). At the transcriptional level, expression of the genes mentioned above also increased except for the negative regulation of GSK-3β mRNA. The increased expression of glucose transport-4 (GLUT-4) was meanwhile observed through immunofluorescence. Nevertheless, the synergistic effect of DSG and 5-MOP on improving glycometabolism was not obvious in the present study. These results suggested that DSG and 5-MOP may improve insulin resistance through an ER-mediated PI3K/Akt activation pathway which may be a new strategy for type 2 , especially for women in an estrogen-deficient condition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31080828> and Its Fenugreek Based Biological Matrix Affect  and Anabolic Hormones in a Rat Based  Model.</a></h2><p>Fenugreek is known since ancient times as a traditional herbal medicine of its multiple beneficial effects. Fenugreek's most studied and employed effect is its hypoglycemic property, but it can also be useful for the treatment of certain thyroid disorders or for the treatment of anorexia. The regulation of glucose homeostasis is a complex mechanism, dependent on the interaction of different types of hormones and neurotransmitters or other compounds. For the study of how  and fenugreek seeds modify  sensitivity, we used a rat  model induced by high-fat diet.  in three different doses (1mg/bwkg, 10mg/bwkg, and 50 mg/bwkg, respectively) and fenugreek seed (0.2 g/bwkg) were administered orally for 6 weeks.  sensitivity was determined by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp method. Our research group found that although glucose infusion rate was not significantly modified in either group, the increased  sensitivity index and high metabolic clearance rate of  found in the 1 mg/kg  and the fenugreek seed treated group suggested an improved peripheral  sensitivity. Results from the 10 mg/kg  group, however, suggest a marked . Fenugreek seed therapy results on the investigated anabolic hormones support the theory that, besides  and gastrointestinal peptides, the hypothalamic-hypopituitary axis regulated hormones synchronized action with IGF-1 also play an important role in the maintaining of normal glucose levels. Both  and fenugreek seeds are capable of interacting with substrates of the above-mentioned regulatory mechanisms, inducing serious hormonal disorders. Moreover, fenugreek seeds showed the ability to reduce the thyroid hormone levels at the periphery and to modify the T4/T3 ratio. It means that in healthy people this effect could be considered a severe side effect; however, in hypothyroidism this effect represents a possibility of alternative natural therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27765371>Protodioscin ameliorates fructose-induced renal injury via inhibition of the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway.</a></h2><p>High dietary fructose can cause metabolic syndrome and renal injury.The effects of protodioscin on metabolic syndrome and renal injury were investigated in mice receiving high-dose fructose.Mice received 30% (w/v) fructose in water and standard chow for 6 weeks to induce metabolic syndrome and were divided into four groups to receive carboxymethylcellulose sodium, allopurinol (5 mg/kg) and protodioscin (5 and 10 mg/kg) continuously for 6 weeks, respectively. The glucose intolerance, serum uric acid (UA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined.Protodioscin significantly improved glucose intolerance and reduced the levels of serum UA, BUN, Cr, TC and TG. Histological examinations showed that protodioscin ameliorated glomerular and tubular pathological changes. Protodioscin significantly reduced renal concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α by inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. In addition, the effect of protodioscin on the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway was examined.Taken together, protodioscin is a potential drug candidate for high dietary fructose-induced metabolic syndrome and renal injury.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Mechanisms that underlie β-cell failure include glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and oxidative stress. This study was designed to assess the protective effect of trigonelline and  against changes in ER stress-associated apoptotic proteins CHOP, Caspase12, and Caspase3 and antioxidant levels in pancreas as well as adipose tissue PPARγ mRNA in T2DM rats. Markers of diabetes and  such as serum glucose, insulin, free fatty acid (FFA), TNF-α, IL-6, and leptin were also assessed. T2DM rats showed significantly elevated levels of pancreatic ER stress proteins and lipid peroxidation, while the antioxidants were significantly reduced. Histological examination also confirmed T2DM-associated damage in pancreas. In addition, a significant increase in serum FFA, TNF-α, IL-6, and decrease in leptin levels along with significantly decreased adipose mass and reduced PPARγ expression were observed in T2DM rats. On the other hand, trigonelline and  treatment independently brought about significant improvement in serum parameters, decrease in apoptotic ER stress proteins, and reinforced antioxidant status in pancreas. Histological examination of pancreas showed normal morphology. Treated groups also showed increased adipose tissue mass and enhanced PPARγ expression. Data from docking studies indicated good interaction of both compounds with PPARγ, and  showed better binding efficiency. These findings suggest that the insulin-sensitizing effects of trigonelline and  are mediated through moderation of ER stress and oxidative stress in pancreas as well as by PPARγ activation in adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19998383> attenuates inflammatory changes in the interaction between adipocytes and macrophages.</a></h2><p>Obese adipose tissues are characterized by the enhanced infiltration of macrophages. It is considered that the paracrine loop involving monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and the free fatty acid between adipocytes and macrophages establishes a vicious cycle that aggravates inflammatory changes and insulin resistance in obese adipose tissues. , a saponin aglycon found in a variety of plants, has anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, we examined the effect of  on the inflammatory changes in the interaction between adipocytes and macrophages. A coculture of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and RAW 264 macrophages markedly enhanced the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and nitric oxide compared with the sum of their single cultures; however, treatment with  inhibited the production of these proinflammatory mediators.  also suppressed the inflammation in RAW 264 macrophages that was induced by the conditioned medium derived from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore,  inhibited the conditioned medium-induced degradation of inhibitor kappaB and the phosphorylation of c-jun N-terminal kinase in macrophages. These results indicate that  exhibits anti-inflammatory properties in the interaction of adipocytes and macrophages by inhibiting the inflammatory signals in macrophages.  may be useful for ameliorating the inflammatory changes in obese adipose tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483735>Dioscin attenuates high‑fat diet‑induced insulin resistance of adipose tissue through the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance, as a common metabolic disorder, may be caused by diet‑induced . The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of dioscin on regulating insulin resistance of adipose tissue induced by a high‑fat diet (HFD). An animal model was established successfully using C57BL/6J mice with high‑fat feeding, followed by treatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg dioscin through gavage for 18 weeks, and randomly divided into a control group, a HFD model group and a dioscin group treated with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day dioscin for 12 weeks. Histopathological changes in adipose tissues were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biochemical parameters of the serum were also monitored, including glucose, insulin, total triglyceride, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‑IR) and adipose insulin resistance (Adipo‑IR) levels. Expression of the mRNA and associated proteins of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS‑1)/phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathways were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. HOMA‑IR and Adipo‑IR values of mice fed with a HFD were significantly higher compared with those in the control group (P<0.01). However, dioscin administration significantly decreased HOMA‑IR and Adipo‑IR values in a dose‑dependent manner (P<0.05), suggesting the effects of dioscin on attenuating insulin resistance. RT‑qPCR results indicated that the associated genes of the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt pathway were significantly downregulated by HFD compared with the control group (P<0.05), while dioscin significantly increased the expression of those genes compared with the control group (P<0.05). Similarly, the significant increase in phosphorylated (p‑)IRS‑1/IRS‑1 (P<0.05) and p‑Akt/Akt (P<0.05) values were substantially reversed by dioscin treatment. Dioscin pronouncedly mitigated insulin resistance in adipose tissues through the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt pathway and has potential to be used as a novel therapeutic agent for the therapy of HFD‑induced insulin resistance in adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22766331> ameliorates palmitate-induced endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance via blocking IKKβ and IRS-1 pathways.</a></h2><p>We investigated whether , a widely used steroidal sapogenin, exerted protection against palmitate (PA)-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in the endothelium.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pretreated with  for 30 min, and then incubated with 100 μmol/L PA for 30 min or 24 h with or without insulin.

High fat (HF) diet-fed mice and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was used to evaluate the effect of DSG. We showed that DSG attenuated metabolic dysfunction in HF diet-fed mice, as evidenced by reduction of blood glucose level and improvement of glucose and insulin intolerance. DSG ameliorated oxidative stress, reduced body weight, fat pads, and systematic lipid profiles and attenuated lipid accumulation. DSG inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and reduced adipocyte size through regulating key factors. DSG inhibited PPARγ and its target gene expression both in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and fat tissues in HF diet-fed mice. Overexpression of PPARγ suppressed DSG-inhibited adipocyte differentiation. DSG significantly increased nuclear expression of ERβ. Inhibition of ERβ significantly suppressed DSG-exerted suppression of adipocyte differentiation and PPARγ expression. In response to DSG stimulation, ERβ bound with RXRα and dissociated RXRα from PPARγ, leading to the reduction of transcriptional activity of PPARγ. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of DSG on adipocyte differentiation and demonstrate that ERβ-exerted regulation of PPARγ expression and activity is critical for DSG-inhibited adipocyte differentiation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the search for effective treatments is a high priority in biomedical research. Products derived from botanicals have a time-honored history of use in the treatment of metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes. Trigonella foenum-graecum, commonly known as fenugreek, is an annual herbaceous plant that has been a staple of traditional herbal medicine in many cultures. Although fenugreek has been studied in both clinical and basic research settings, questions remain about its efficacy and biologic mechanisms of action. , 4-hydroxyisoleucine, and the fiber component of the plant are the most intensively studied bioactive constituents present in fenugreek. These compounds have been demonstrated to exert beneficial effects on several physiologic markers including glucose tolerance, inflammation, insulin action, liver function, blood lipids, and cardiovascular health. Although insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the favorable effects of fenugreek have been gained, we still do not have definitive evidence establishing its role as a therapeutic agent in metabolic disease. This review aims to summarize the currently available evidence on the physiologic effects of the 3 best-characterized bioactive compounds of fenugreek, with particular emphasis on biologic mechanisms of action relevant in the context of metabolic syndrome.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27871063>Dioscorea esculenta-induced increase in muscle sex steroid hormones is associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity in a type 2  rat model.</a></h2><p>The effects of chronic Dioscorea esculenta administration and exercise training on muscle sex steroid hormone levels and insulin resistance in type 2  rats was assessed.

Traditionally the seeds are used as macerate for the treatment of diabetes, cough, and flatulence, to increase breast milk secretion, and for anti-inflammatory and aphrodisiac effects. The use is limited by its unpleasant smell and bitter taste which can be modified by adding mint leaves to the macerate. Antidiabetic properties are attributed mainly to galactomannan, 4-hydroxyisoleucin (4-OH-Ile),  and trigonelline. These substances demonstrate direct antidiabetic properties in clinical studies by increasing insulin secretion (4-OH-Ile), decreasing insulin resistance and glucose resorption from the GIT (galactomannan) and improvement in B-cells regeneration (trigonelline). Besides this main effect, the herb improves blood lipid spectre (4-OH-Ile, ), and has reno-protective (4-OH-Ile, trigonelline), neuroprotective (trigonelline) and antioxidant (, trigonelline) effects. Antidiabetic efficacy of trigonelline is comparable to glibenclamide treatment and more effective than sitagliptine therapy.

Alimentary treatments were carried out for six weeks. The abdominal aortas were isolated, and 2 mm wide rings were sectioned off and mounted at a resting tension of 10 mN in organ baths containing Krebs solution (36 °C) exposed to 95% O₂ and 5% CO₂. After 60-min incubation, a norepinephrine concentration-response (E/c) curve was generated to determine their half-maximal effective concentration (EC) value. After 60-min wash-out, a pre-contraction with norepinephrine EC was made, followed by an acetylcholine E/c curve. Plasma glutathione levels, glutathione-handling enzyme activities and blood antioxidant capacities were also determined. HFHSD significantly decreased the dilatory response to acetylcholine and increased plasma glutathione levels and these effects were significantly reversed by fenugreek seed flour, 10 and 50 mg/kg bw/day .

In this study, the blood glucose regulation activity and mechanism of total saponins from P. kingianum (TSPK) were investigated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats in this research.TSPK (0.025g/kg and 0.1mg/kg) was administrated by gavage to STZ-induced diabetic rats for 8 weeks. Changes of body weight, food intakes, blood glucose, serum insulin and lipid indexes were observed. Genome-wide expression profiling was applied to explore the gene expression alternation after treated with TSPK. Expressions of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), the relative transcript level of glucose kinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (GK/G6P) in the liver were investigated. Meanwhile, contents of AMPK, and glucose transporter subtype-4 (GLUT4) in skeletal muscle, and peroxysome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ) in adipose tissue were investigated.TSPK could effectively alleviate hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetic rats. Genome-wide expression profiling showed that TSPK up-regulated the expression of GLUT4 while down-regulated the expression of G6P in insulin signal pathway. In the liver, the expression of AMPK and GK are increased. Further more, TSPK promoted the expressions of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, and PPAR-γ in adipose tissue, respectively.These results provide possible mechanisms for the antidiabetic effects of TSPK. TSPK could promote not only glycogenesis but also glucose utilization in peripheral tissue.
