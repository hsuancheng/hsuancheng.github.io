While chemical synthesis often leads to undesired racemic mixtures, microbial production allows obtaining optically pure lactones. The production of a specific lactone by biotransformation depends on the supply of the corresponding hydroxy fatty acid, which has economic and industrial value similar to γ-lactones. Hence, the identification and exploration of microorganisms with the rare natural ability for de novo biosynthesis of lactones will contribute to the long-term sustainability of microbial production. In this study, the innate ability of Ashbya gossypii for de novo production of γ-lactones from glucose was evaluated and improved.Characterization of the volatile organic compounds produced by nine strains of this industrial filamentous fungus in glucose-based medium revealed the noteworthy presence of seven chemically different γ-lactones. To decipher and understand the de novo biosynthesis of γ-lactones from glucose, we developed metabolic engineering strategies focused on the fatty acid biosynthesis and the β-oxidation pathways. Overexpression of AgDES589, encoding a desaturase for the conversion of oleic acid (C18:1) into linoleic acid (C18:2), and deletion of AgELO624, which encodes an elongase that catalyses the formation of C20:0 and C22:0 fatty acids, greatly increased the production of γ-lactones (up to 6.4-fold; (7.6 ± 0.8) × 10 µg/g). Further substitution of AgPOX1, encoding the exclusive acyl-CoA oxidase in A. gossypii, by a codon-optimized POX2 gene from Yarrowia lipolytica, which encodes a specific long chain acyl-CoA oxidase, fine-tuned the biosynthesis of γ-decalactone to a relative production of more than 99%.This study demonstrates the potential of A. gossypii as a model and future platform for de novo biosynthesis of γ-lactones. By means of metabolic engineering, key enzymatic steps involved in their production were elucidated. Moreover, the combinatorial metabolic engineering strategies developed resulted in improved de novo biosynthesis of γ-decalactone. In sum, these proof-of-concept data revealed yet unknown metabolic and genetic determinants important for the future exploration of the de novo production of γ-lactones as an alternative to biotransformation processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28238071>Acyl-CoA oxidase 1 is involved in γ-decalactone release from peach (Prunus persica) fruit.</a></h2><p>γ-Decalactone accumulation in peach mesocarp was highly correlated with ACX enzyme activity and natural PpACX1 content. Adding the purified recombinant PpACX1 induced γ-decalactone biosynthesis in cultured mesocarp discs in vitro. Previous gene expression studies have implied that acyl coenzyme A oxidase (ACX) is related to lactones synthesis, the characteristic aroma compounds of peach. Here, we analysed the correlation between γ-decalactone content and ACX enzyme activity in mesocarp of five different types of fully ripe peach varieties. Furthermore, 'Hu Jing Mi Lu' ('HJ') and 'Feng Hua Yu Lu' ('YL'), which have strong aroma among them, at four ripening stages were selected to study the role of ACX in lactone biosynthesis. The result showed that γ-decalactone was the most abundant lactone compound. γ-Decalactone accumulation was highly correlated with ACX enzyme activity. Mass spectrometry (MS) showed that PpACX1 was the most abundant PpACX protein in fully ripe mesocarp of cv. 'HJ'. To further elucidate the function of the PpACX1 protein, the PpACX1 gene was heterologously expressed in a bacterial system and characterized in vitro. MS identification gave the molecular  of the recombinant PpACX1 as 94.44 kDa and the coverage rate of the peptide segments was 47.3%. In cultured mesocarp discs in vitro, adding the purified recombinant PpACX1 and C-CoA substrate induced the expected γ-decalactone biosynthesis. Using a sandwich ELISA based on mixed mono- and polyclonal antibodies against recombinant PpACX1, PpACX1 content in mesocarp was found to be highly correlated with γ-decalactone accumulation in mesocarp of five fully ripe varieties and four ripening stages of 'HJ' and 'YL'. This study revealed the vital function of PpACX1 in γ-decalactone biosynthesis in peach fruit.</p></html>
