The aim of this work was to validate that observation in human cells and humans.We investigated the induction of in-vitro  and the activation of PPARgamma-target genes, adiponectin and lipoprotein lipase, by ARB in human preadipocytes. We also studied PPARgamma response-element-driven luciferase reporter gene activation in human adipocytes. Finally, we treated 14 obese men for 10 days with placebo crossed over with 150 mg/day . Subcutaneous fat was analyzed for mRNA expression of adiponectin and lipoprotein lipase.Telmisartan and , and to a lesser degree losartan, induced  and activated PPARgamma-target genes. This stimulation of PPARgamma-target genes was prevented by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662. Eprosartan had no effect. Paradoxically, all ARB activated the luciferase reporter gene. PPARgamma activity increased approximately two-fold with pioglitazone and 1.5-fold with the ARB in all assays. In the cross-over clinical study,  lowered blood pressure but had no effect on adiponectin or lipoprotein lipase mRNA expression.Our data are the first to show that ARB induce  and PPARgamma-target gene expression in human adipocytes. Pharmacokinetic differences may contribute to the heterogeneous effects on metabolism and preadipocyte differentiation. In humans, larger doses of ARB, longer treatments, or both may be required to activate PPARgamma in adipose cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12031955>Mature adipocytes inhibit in vitro differentiation of human preadipocytes via angiotensin type 1 receptors.</a></h1><p>Recent studies suggest that angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a role in the  of murine preadipocytes. Here, we examined the role of Ang II for the differentiation of primary cultured human preadipocytes. Preadipocytes were isolated from human adipose tissue and stimulated to differentiate. Quantitation of gene expression during  was performed for renin-angiotensin system (RAS) genes. The influence of the RAS on adipogenic differentiation was investigated by addition of either angiotensinogen (AGT), Ang II, or angiotensin receptor antagonists to the differentiation medium. We also examined the influence of adipocytes on  by co-culture experiments. Expression of the RAS genes AGT, renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and Ang II type 1 receptor increased during . Stimulation of the Ang II type 1 receptor by Ang II reduced adipose conversion, whereas blockade of this receptor markedly enhanced . Adipocytes were able to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation in the co-culture, and this effect was abolished by blockade of the Ang II type 1 receptor. This finding points to a functional role of the RAS in the differentiation of human adipose tissue. Because AGT secretion and Ang II generation are characteristic features of , we postulate a paracrine negative-feedback loop that inhibits further recruitment of preadipocytes by maturing adipocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16765099>Molecular activation of PPARgamma by angiotensin II type 1-receptor antagonists.</a></h1><p>Elevated blood pressure and insulin resistance are strongly associated in patients. We explored the potential for the anti-hypertensive angiotensin II type 1-receptor (ATR(1)) antagonists to improve insulin sensitivity through modulation of the nuclear receptor PPARgamma, in vitro and in vivo compared to the potent insulin sensitizer, rosiglitazone.PPARgamma modulation by ATR(1) antagonists was measured first by direct recruitment of PGC-1, followed by trans-activation reporter assays in cells, and promotion of  in fibroblast and pre-adipocyte cell lines. Improvement of insulin sensitivity was measured as changes in levels of glucose, insulin, and adiponectin in ob/ob mice.Telmisartan, candesartan, , and losartan (but not valsartan or olmesartan) each served as bona fide PPARgamma ligands in vitro, with EC(50) values between 3 and 5 micro mol/l. However, only telmisartan, and to a lesser extent candesartan, resulted in significant PPARgamma agonism in cells. In vivo, although rosiglitazone significantly lowered both glucose (33%, p<0.01) and insulin (61%, p<0.01) levels and increased expression of adiponectin (74%, p<0.001), sartan treatment had no effect.Many members of the sartan family of ATR(1) antagonists are PPARgamma ligands in cell-free assays but their modulation of PPARgamma in cells is relatively weak. Furthermore, none appear to improve insulin sensitivity in a rodent model under conditions where other insulin sensitizers, including rosiglitazone, do. These results question whether reported effects of sartans on insulin sensitivity may be through other means, and should guide further efforts to develop dual agents to treat hypertension and insulin resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16298156>Treating the metabolic syndrome using angiotensin receptor antagonists that selectively modulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma.</a></h1><p>The metabolic syndrome, defined as a cluster of visceral obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and elevated blood pressure, is associated with pro-thrombotic, pro-atherogenic and inflammatory risk factors that predispose to cardiovascular disease. Although activators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARalpha,gamma,delta) in various combinations are under development for treating the metabolic syndrome, they are hampered by adverse effects related to increased , weight gain, fluid overload and carcinogenesis. The recent discovery that telmisartan and , antihypertensive angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) blockers (ARBs), were uniquely capable of activating PPARgamma, has provided a novel approach to addressing the multifactorial components of the metabolic syndrome. Both drugs have established favorable safety profiles and can activate PPARgamma at concentrations potentially achievable at therapeutic doses. Emerging studies have revealed that both these drugs have beneficial metabolic profiles. This information provides a strategic rationale and pharmacological platform for the development of novel dual ARB/PPARgamma agonists to target the metabolic syndrome and its cardiovascular sequelae, for which therapy is presently insufficient or non-existent. Beneficial effects of these agents include increased energy expenditure, improved lipid profile, increased insulin sensitivity, blood pressure reduction, and amelioration of the associated pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic risk profiles. The potential benefit for treatment of the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular protection, and prevention of related end-organ complications could be of immense clinical value.</p></html>
