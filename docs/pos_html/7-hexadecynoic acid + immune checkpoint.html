Here, we report a series of novel Pt(IV) complexes derived from the conjugation of platinum(II) anticancer agents with an   TDO inhibitor. These complexes not only showed significant cytotoxic effects on the tested cancer  lines, but also could enhance antitumor  response. Particularly, complex T2, the mono-conjuagte of oxoplatin and (E)-4-oxo-4-(3-(2-(pyridin-3-yl)vinyl)-1H-indol-1-yl)butanoic , displayed 35-fold more potency than cisplatin against TDO-overexpressed HepG-2 cancer cells. Further study indicated that T2 could inhibit TDO via releasing a derivative of a TDO inhibitor and block kynurenine production, resulting in T- activation and proliferation in vitro. In vivo tests proved that T2 as a potent immunomodulator could highly promote the antitumor activity of cisplatin and effectively suppress the expression of TDO. This immunochemotherapeutic strategy can be promisingly applied to treat with TDO-overexpressed cancers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Unique tumor mutations are key T- targets, but a comprehensive understanding of the nature of a successful antitumor T- response is lacking. To investigate the T- receptor (TCR) repertoire associated with treatment success versus failure, we used a well-characterized mouse carcinoma that is rejected by CD8 T cells in mice treated with radiotherapy (RT) and anti-CTLA-4 in combination, but not as monotherapy, and comprehensively analyzed tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) by high-throughput sequencing of the  CDR3 region. The combined treatment increased TIL density and CD8/CD4 ratio. Assessment of the frequency of T- clones indicated that anti-CTLA-4 resulted in fewer clones and a more oligoclonal repertoire compared with untreated tumors. In contrast, RT increased the CD8/CD4 ratio and broadened the TCR repertoire, and when used in combination with anti-CTLA-4, these selected T- clones proliferated. Hierarchical clustering of CDR3 sequences showed a treatment-specific clustering of TCRs that were shared by different mice. Abundant clonotypes were commonly shared between animals and yet treatment-specific. Analysis of amino- sequence similarities revealed a significant increase in the number and richness of dominant CDR3 motifs in tumors treated with RT + anti-CTLA-4 compared with control. The repertoire of TCRs reactive with a single tumor antigen recognized by CD8 T cells was heterogeneous but highly clonal, irrespective of treatment. Overall, data support a model whereby a diverse TCR repertoire is required to achieve tumor rejection and may underlie the synergy between RT and CTLA-4 blockade. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28522738>Imaging of Programmed  Death Ligand 1: Impact of Protein Concentration on Distribution of Anti-PD-L1 SPECT Agents in an Immunocompetent Murine Model of Melanoma.</a></h2><p>Programmed  death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is part of an   system that is essential for preventing autoimmunity and cancer. Recent approaches in immunotherapy that target   have shown great promise in a variety of cancers, including metastatic melanoma. The use of targeted molecular imaging would help identify patients who will best respond to anti-PD-L1 treatment while potentially providing key information to limit -related adverse effects. Recently, we developed an antibody-based PD-L1-targeted SPECT agent-In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic  (DTPA)-anti-PD-L1-to identify PD-L1-positive tumors in vivo. To best use such PD-L1-targeted imaging agents, it is important, as a first step, to understand how the signal is affected by different parameters.  We evaluated the impact of protein concentration on the distribution of In-DTPA-anti-PD-L1 in a murine model of aggressive melanoma. In-DTPA-anti-PD-L1 (dissociation constant, 0.6 ± 0.1 nM) demonstrated increased uptake in B16F10 tumors at protein concentrations equaling or exceeding 1 mg/kg at 24 h and 3 mg/kg at 72 h. At 24 h, the PD-L1-rich spleen and lungs demonstrated decreasing uptake with increasing protein concentration. At 72 h, uptake in the thymus was significantly increased at protein concentrations of 3 mg/kg or greater. Both time points demonstrated increased tracer amounts remaining in circulation as the amount of cold antibody was increased.  These studies demonstrate that In-DTPA-anti-PD-L1 is capable of identifying tumors that overexpresses PD-L1 and monitoring the impact of PD-L1-rich organs on the distribution of anti-PD-L1 antibodies.© 2017 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30068698>Identification of a novel c-Myc inhibitor with antitumor effects on multiple myeloma cells.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence shows that c-Myc oncoprotein is tightly associated with multiple myeloma (MM) progression.

Therefore, new therapeutic interventions are needed to increase the immunogenicity of tumors and overcome the resistance to these immunotherapies. Oncolytic properties of common viruses can be exploited for the priming of antitumor immunity, and such oncolytic viruses are currently in active clinical development in combination with  -targeted therapies. However, the routine implementation of these therapies is limited by their manufacturing constraints, the risk of exposure of clinical staff, and the ongoing regulations on genetically modified organisms. We sought to determine whether anti-infectious disease vaccines could be used as a commercially available source of immunostimulatory agents for cancer immunotherapy. We found that rotavirus vaccines have both immunostimulatory and oncolytic properties. In vitro, they can directly kill cancer cells with features of immunogenic  death. In vivo, intratumoral rotavirus therapy has antitumor effects that are dependent on the  system. In several immunocompetent murine tumor models, intratumoral rotavirus overcomes resistance to and synergizes with  -targeted therapy. Heat- and UV-inactivated rotavirus lost their oncolytic activity but kept their synergy with  -targeted antibodies through the up-regulation of the double-stranded RNA receptor retinoic -induced gene 1 (RIG-I). Rotavirus vaccines are clinical-grade products used in pediatric and adult populations. Therefore, in situ immunization strategies with intratumoral-attenuated rotavirus could be implemented quickly in the clinic.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

These therapies are known to cause -related side effects; however, their role in patients with a preexisting autoimmune disease is not clear.We describe two cases of anti-PD-1 -related adverse events. A 52-year-old male with longstanding type 1 diabetes (T1D), long-term stable kidney transplant, and hypothyroidism received two separate anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies for metastatic melanoma. The patient developed acute kidney graft rejection requiring hemodialysis and worsening of autoimmune hypothyroidism 3 weeks after starting treatment. He continued anti-PD-1 treatments and remained on hemodialysis and increased levothyroxine dosage. The second case is a 62-year-old male with no previous history of diabetes who received anti-PD-1 treatment and developed severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) 5 days following the start of therapy. Further laboratory testing revealed high titer antibodies directed against glutamic  decarboxylase. These antibodies, which were of the IgG isotype and involved in memory  responses, were likely present before anti-PD-1 treatment. He also had human leukocyte antigen genes that confer T1D genetic risk. Despite normal pretreatment blood glucose levels and HbA1c, the patient requires permanent exogenous insulin treatment.Patients with preexisting endocrine autoimmunity may have more frequent and severe -related side effects with anti-PD-1 treatment. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with solid organ transplant rejection and DKA, clinicians caring for patients receiving these state-of-the-art therapies need to be aware of the potential adverse events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30378157>Endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagic and apoptotic  death, and  activation by a natural triterpenoid in human prostate cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Though the current therapies are effective at clearing an early stage prostate cancer, they often fail to treat late-stage metastatic disease. We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of a natural triterpenoid, ganoderic  DM (GA-DM), on two human prostate cancer  lines: the androgen-independent prostate carcinoma (PC-3), and androgen-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma (LNCaP).  viability assay showed that GA-DM was relatively more toxic to LNCaP cells than to PC-3 cells (IC s ranged 45-55 µM for PC-3, and 20-25 µM for LNCaP), which may have occurred due to differential expression of p53. Hoechst DNA staining confirmed detectable nuclear fragmentation in both  lines irrespective of the p53 status. GA-DM treatment decreased Bcl-2 proteins while it upregulated apoptotic Bax and autophagic Beclin-1, Atg5, and LC-3 molecules, and caused an induction of both early and late events of apoptotic  death. Biochemical analyses of GA-DM-treated prostate cancer cells demonstrated that caspase-3 cleavage was notable in GA-DM-treated PC-3 cells. Interestingly, GA-DM treatment altered   progression in the S phase with a significant growth arrest in the G2  and enhanced CD4  T  recognition of prostate tumor cells. Mechanistic study of GA-DM-treated prostate cancer cells further demonstrated that calpain activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress contributed to  death. These findings suggest that GA-DM is a candidate for future drug design for prostate cancer as it activates multiple pathways of  death and  recognition.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102938>Genetic association between HLA-G 14-bp polymorphism and diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>HLA-G is an   molecule. Since a differential molecule expression has been reported even for healthy individuals, many studies have focused on polymorphisms at HLA-G regulatory regions, particularly the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The presence/absence of a 14-bp sequence was the first polymorphism described and it is the most studied in association between HLA-G and disorders.In this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all association studies published regarding the HLA-G 14-bp.We verified association between 14-bp alleles and diseases in the following situations: (1) presence of 14-bp (insertion) conferred susceptibility to preeclampsia (child alleles evaluated) and systemic lupus erythematosus (OR = 1.42; 95%CI = 1.04-1.93; p = 0.026 and OR = 1.13; 95%CI = 1.01-1.27, p = 0.028); (2) 14-bp absence (deletion) was associated with increased risk to breast cancer (OR = 1.23; 95%CI = 1.06-1.43; p = 0.006) and human Cytomegalovirus infection (OR = 2.06; 95%CI = 1.60-2.64; p < 0.0001); and (3) a risk association was observed between the group of reproductive disorders and the 14-bp insertion (OR = 1.12; 95%CI = 1.01-1.24; p = 0.034).Considering that others 14-bp associations were inconclusive and that other variation sites observed at HLA-G 3'UTR exhibit a proven role on post-transcriptional regulation of HLA-G expression, the complete 3'UTR segment should be analyzed in terms of disease susceptibility, instead of a single polymorphism.Copyright © 2018.

These tumors adapt to treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy by stimulating secretion of molecules that cause tryptophan metabolism to be disrupted. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) are produced, accelerating metabolism along the kynurenine pathway and resulting in excess levels of quinolinic , 3-hydroxyanthranilic  and other neurotoxic molecules. IDO and TDO also act as  molecules that suppress T- function. GBM is particularly associated with severe immunosuppression, and this tumor type might be thought to be the ideal candidate for  inhibitor therapy. However, treatment with  inhibitors now in clinical use for peripheral solid tumors, such as those inhibiting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA4) or programmed  death-1 (PD1) receptors, results in further abnormalities of tryptophan metabolism. This implies that to obtain optimal results in the treatment of GBM, one may need to add an inhibitor of the kynurenine pathway to therapy with a CTLA4 or PD1 inhibitor, or use agents which can suppress multiple  molecules.Copyright© 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

T-  inhibitors are revolutionizing the management of advanced cancers including non-small  lung cancer and melanoma. Unfortunately, many common cancers are not responsive to these drugs and resistance remains problematic. A growing number of novel cancer immunotherapies have been discovered but their clinical translation has been limited by shortcomings of conventional drug delivery.  signaling is tightly-regulated and often requires simultaneous or near-simultaneous activation of multiple signals in specific subpopulations of  cells. Nucleic  therapies, which require intact intracellular delivery, are among the most promising approaches to modulate the tumor microenvironment to a pro-immunogenic phenotype.

The latest therapeutic perspectives under development for  modulator administration exploits vectorization, and biodegradable delivery systems are one of the most promising vehicles. Nanoparticles based on Poly (D,L) Lactic  (PLA) as polymer for formulation are widely investigated due to its bioresorbable, biocompatible and low immunogen properties. We propose a PLA-based nanoparticle delivery system to vectorize PamCSK, a lipopeptide TLR1/2 ligand and a potent activator of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB that shows a self-assembling behavior from 30 µg/mL onwards. We demonstrate successful encapsulation of PamCSK in PLA nanoparticles by nanoprecipitation in a 40-180 µg/mL concentration range, with 99% of entrapment efficiency. By molecular modelling, we characterize drug/carrier interactions and conclude that PamCSK forms clusters onto the nanoparticle and is not encapsulated into the hydrophobic core. In silico predictions provide nanoprecipitation optimization and the mechanistic understanding of the particle dynamics. The loaded-PamCSK maintains bioactivity on TLR2, confirmed by in vitro experiments using reporter  line HEK-Blue hTLR2. Our presented data and results are convincing evidence that PamCSK-loaded in PLA nanoparticles represent a promising  modulating system.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanism of molecular recognition and inhibition of PD-L1 mAbs is not yet clear, which hinders the subsequent antibody design and modification. In this work, the trajectories of PD-1/PD-L1 and nanobody/PD-L1 complexes were obtained via comparative molecular dynamics simulations. Then, a series of physicochemical parameters including hydrogen bond, dihedral angle distribution, pa value and binding free energy, and so forth, were all comparatively analyzed to investigate the recognition difference between PD-L1 and PD-1 and nanobody. Both R113 (the amino  residues in PD-L1 are represented by the lower left sign of L) and R125 residues of PD-L1 undergo significant conformational change after association with mAbs, which dominates a strong electrostatic interaction. Solvation effect analysis revealed that solvent-water enhanced molecular recognition between PD-L1 and nanobody. By combining the analyses of the time-dependent root mean squared fluctuation (RMSF), free energy landscape, clustering and energy decomposition, the potential inhibition mechanism was proposed that the nanobody competitively and specifically bound to the β-sheet groups of PD-L1, reduced the PD-L1’s flexibility and finally blocked the formation of PD-1/PD-L1 complex. Based on the simulation results, site-directed mutagenesis of D99 (the amino  residues in Nano are displayed by the lower left sign of N) and Q116 in the nanobody may be beneficial for improving antibody activity.

In addition to activation-induced signaling cascades, metabolic reprogramming (profound changes in metabolic pathways) also provides a novel form of regulation to control the formation of desirable  responses.  cells encounter various nutrient compositions by circulating in bloodstream and infiltrating into peripheral tissues; therefore, proper engagement of metabolic pathways is critical to fulfill the metabolic demands of  cells.

Here, a strategy involving blocking programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) to enhance the chemotherapeutic effect of a doxorubicin nanoprodrug HA-Psi-DOX is proposed and the synergetic mechanism between them is further studied. The nanoprodrugs are fabricated by conjugating doxorubicin (DOX) to an anionic polymer hyaluronic  (HA) via a tumor overexpressed matrix metalloproteinase sensitive peptide (CPLGLAGG) for tumor targeting and enzyme-activated drug release. Once accumulated at the tumor site, the nanoprodrug can be activated to release antitumor drug by tumor overexpressed MMP-2. It is found that HA-Psi-DOX nanoparticles can kill tumor cells effectively and initiate an antitumor  response, leading to the upregulation of interferon-γ. This cytokine promotes the expression of programmed  death protein-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells, which will cause immunosuppression after interacting with PD-1 on the surface of lymphocytes. The results suggest that the therapeutic efficiency of HA-Psi-DOX nanoparticles is significantly improved when combined with  inhibitors anti-PD-1 antibody (α-PD1) due to the neutralization of immunosuppression by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1.

The blockade of PD‑1/PD‑L1 interaction using monoclonal antibodies has emerged as an effective therapy for several solid tumors; however, durable response has been observed in a subset of patients with PD‑L1-positive tumors. Thus, the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the expression of PD‑L1 in tumor cells may help to improve the response to PD‑L1 blockade therapies. In this study, we investigated whether resveratrol, a grape-derived stilbenoid with immunoregulatory activity, modulates the expression of PD‑L1 in breast and colorectal cancer cells. The surface expression of PD‑L1 was determined by flow cytometry in cancer cells treated with resveratrol and/or piceatannol. Each stilbenoid alone induced PD‑L1 and when used in combination, elicited a synergistic upregulation of PD‑L1 in some  lines. The induction of PD‑L1 by the combined use of stilbenoids was most pronounced in the Cal51 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and SW620 colon cancer cells. The observed induction of PD‑L1 was transcriptionally mediated by nuclear factor (NF)-κB, as shown by NF‑κB reporter assays, the nuclear accumulation of the p65 subunit of NF‑κB, inhibition by the IKK inhibitor, BMS‑345541, and histone the modification inhibitors, resminostat, entinostat or anacardic . Combined treatment with resveratrol and piceatannol also decreased tumor  survival as indicated by the upregulation of the DNA damaging marker, γH2AX, the cleavage of caspase 3, the downregulation of the survival markers, p38-MAPK/c‑Myc, and G1-to-S   arrest.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29302770>Modulating Tumor Immunology by Inhibiting Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase (IDO): Recent Developments and First Clinical Experiences.</a></h2><p>Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) catalyze the first rate-limiting step in the oxidative metabolism of compounds containing indole rings, including the transformation of the essential amino  L-tryptophan to N-formyl-L-kynurenine.

We therefore conducted a study of the effects of pretreatment gut microbiota and metabolites on ICT Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors response in 39 metastatic melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab plus nivolumab (IN), or pembrolizumab (P). IN yielded 67% responses and 8% stable disease; P achieved 23% responses and 23% stable disease. ICT responders for all types of therapies were enriched for Bacteroides caccae. Among IN responders, the gut microbiome was enriched for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides thetaiotamicron, and Holdemania filiformis.

Lu-DOTA-PEG-LLP2A (Lu-LLP2A) is a TRT that shows high affinity for VLA-4 and high uptake in B16F10 mouse melanoma tumors in vivo. Here, we report efficacy studies of Lu-LLP2A, alone and combined with   inhibitors (ICIs) (anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies), in B16F10 tumor-bearing mice.  Tumor cells (1 × 10) were implanted subcutaneously in C57BL/6 mice. After 8-10 d, the mice were randomized into 8 groups. Lu-LLP2A was injected intravenously on day 8 or 9 (single dose), and ICI antibodies were administered intraperitoneally in 3 doses. Tumor growth was monitored over time via calipers. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining for apoptosis was performed on fixed tumors. In a separate study, Cy3-LLP2A or Cy3-scrambled LLP2A was injected in tumor-bearing mice, and tumors were collected 4 h after injection and then analyzed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy using different   markers.  TRT alone showed efficacy comparable to the dual-ICI anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-L1 + anti-CTLA-4, whereas TRT + ICIs significantly enhanced survival. TUNEL staining showed that the highest levels of apoptosis were in the TRT + ICI groups. In addition to targeting tumor cells, TRT also bound  cells in the tumor microenvironment. Flow cytometry data showed that the tumors consisted of about 77% tumor cells and fibroblasts (CD45-negative/CD49d-positive) and about 23%  cells (CD45-positive/CD49d-positive) and that  cells expressed higher levels of VLA-4. Cy3-LLP2A and CD49d colocalized with macrophages (CD68), T cells (CD8, CD4), and B cells (CD19). Immunohistochemical analysis identified a significant colocalization of Cy3-LLP2A and CD68.

Use of this combination treatment schema in mouse models of NSCLC reverses tumor  evasion and modulates T  exhaustion state towards memory and effector T  phenotypes. Key correlative science metrics emerge for an upcoming clinical trial, testing enhancement of   therapy for NSCLC.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Gut microbiota has a strong impact on host immunostasis and homeostasis of gut function for maintaining the health condition. Dysbiosis leads to an increase in bacterial populations that stimulate tumorigenesis, and contributes to epithelial carcinogenesis and tumor progression by altering metabolic properties(such as bile  and butyric )and inflammatory process. Inflammation aid the bacterial translocation into the neoplastic tissue, which in turn promotes production of inflammatory cytokines subsequently leading to tumor growth. The colonic microbiota such as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis(ETBF)may also promote colorectal cancer by stimulating exaggerated  responses via Th17 cells. Dysbiosis caused by a deficiency of the NLRP6 inflammasome promotes cancer development via interleukin-6(IL- 6)-induced epithelial proliferation. Emerging data suggest that certain groups of bacteria might promote whereas others might protect against colon cancer. Indeed, Fusobacteriumnucleatum (F. nucleatum)seems to play a central role in the tumor microenvironment as its abundance correlates with cancer progression as well as the dysbiotic tumor microbiota composition including Bacteroides and Prevotella species. Moreover, gut microbiota not only plays a key role in carcinogenesis but also influences the efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapy, especially   inhibitors by targeting the programmed death receptor 1(PD-1)and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4(CTLA-4).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30037229>Peptide-Based Ga-PET Radiotracer for Imaging PD-L1 Expression in Cancer.</a></h2><p>Tumors create and maintain an immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes cancer  escape from  surveillance. The   protein programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed in many cancers and is an important contributor to the maintenance of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. PD-L1 is a prominent target for cancer immunotherapy. Guidance of anti-PD-L1 therapy is currently effected through measurement of PD-L1 through biopsy and immunohistochemistry. Here, we report a peptide-based imaging agent, [Ga]WL12, to detect PD-L1 expression in tumors noninvasively by positron emission tomography (PET). WL12, a cyclic peptide comprising 14 amino , binds to PD-L1 with high affinity (IC50≈ 23 nM). Synthesis of [Ga]WL12 provided radiochemical purity >99% after purification. Biodistribution in immunocompetent mice demonstrated 11.56 ± 3.18, 4.97 ± 0.8, 1.9 ± 0.1, and 1.33 ± 0.21 percentage of injected dose per gram (%ID/g) in hPD-L1, MDAMB231, SUM149, and CHO tumors, respectively, at 1 h postinjection, with high binding specificity noted with coinjection of excess, nonradiolabeled WL12. PET imaging demonstrated high tissue contrast in all tumor models tested.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29974196>Targeting tumor-associated acidity in cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p> inhibitors, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed  death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies have changed profoundly the treatment of melanoma, renal  carcinoma, non-small  lung cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and bladder cancer. Currently, they are tested in various tumor entities as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapies or targeted therapies. However, only a subgroup of patients benefit from  blockade (combinations). This raises the question, which all mechanisms inhibit T  function in the tumor environment, restricting the efficacy of these immunotherapeutic approaches. Serum activity of lactate dehydrogenase, likely reflecting the glycolytic activity of the tumor cells and thus acidity within the tumor microenvironment, turned out to be one of the strongest markers predicting response to  inhibition. In this review, we discuss the impact of tumor-associated acidity on the efficacy of T -mediated cancer immunotherapy and possible approaches to break this barrier.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29048978>Antitumor effect of oral cancer vaccine with Bifidobacterium delivering WT1 protein to gut  system is superior to WT1 peptide vaccine.</a></h2><p>Despite the revolutionary progress of   inhibitors (CPIs) for cancer immunotherapy, CPIs are effective only in a subset of patients. Combining CPIs and cancer vaccines to achieve better clinical outcomes is a reasonable approach since CPI enhances cancer vaccine-induced tumor-associated antigen (TAA) specific CTL. Among the various TAAs so far identified, WT1 protein is one of the most promising TAAs as a cancer vaccine target. Until now clinical trials of WT1 vaccine have demonstrated only modest clinical efficacy. These WT1 vaccines were based on peptides or dendritic cells (DCs), and there was no oral cancer vaccine. Recently, we developed a WT1 oral cancer vaccine using a recombinant Bifidobacterium displaying WT1 protein, which can efficiently deliver WT1 protein to the gut  system, and we demonstrated that this oral cancer vaccine had a significant anti-tumor effect in a C1498-WT1 murine leukemia syngeneic tumor model. The WT1 protein displayed in this vaccine consists of about 70% of the WT1 amino  sequence including multiple known CD4 and CD8 T- epitopes of WT1. In this commentary, we introduce our recent data indicating the superior anti-tumor effect of a WT1 oral cancer vaccine delivering WT1 protein to the gut  system compared to a peptide vaccine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28782050>Theranostic Gold Nanoantennas for Simultaneous Multiplexed Raman Imaging of Immunomarkers and Photothermal Therapy.</a></h2><p>In this study, we demonstrate the theranostic capability of actively targeted, site-specific multibranched gold nanoantennas (MGNs) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in vitro. By utilizing multiplexed surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging, enabled by the narrow peak widths of Raman signatures, we simultaneously targeted   receptor programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in TNBC cells. A 1:1 mixture of MGNs functionalized with anti-PDL1 antibodies and Raman tag 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic ) (DTNB) and MGNs functionalized with anti-EGFR antibodies and Raman tag -mercaptobenzoic  (MBA) were incubated with the cells. SERS imaging revealed a cellular traffic map of MGN localization by surface binding and receptor-mediated endocytosis, enabling targeted diagnosis of both biomarkers. Furthermore, cells incubated with anti-EGFR-MBA-MGNs and illuminated with an 808 nm laser for 15 min at 4.7 W/cm exhibited photothermal  death only within the laser spot (indicated by live/dead  fluorescence assay). Therefore, this study not only provides an optical imaging platform that can track immunomarkers with spatiotemporal control but also demonstrates an externally controlled light-triggered therapeutic approach enabling receptor-specific treatment with biocompatible theranostic nanoprobes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088651>Can an amino -based oral rehydration solution be effective in managing  therapy-induced diarrhea?</a></h2><p>  inhibitor (ICPi) therapy has transformed the way we treat cancer. However, its  related adverse events (irAEs) can be debilitating and life threatening.  therapy-induced diarrhea (ITID) is one of the most commonly encountered irAEs and can lead to expensive and prolonged hospitalizations. The current standard of care for grade 3 or 4 ITID involves ICPi discontinuation, the initiation of steroids, and infliximab for refractory disease. This treatment regimen reverses the desired anti-tumor effect of ICPis, can lead to side effects, and is cost-ineffective. We report the first case of the successful treatment of grade 3 ITID with steroids and an amino -based oral rehydration solution (AA-ORS), enterade. Research suggests that AA-ORS may be used to reduce diarrhea and adequately hydrate patients, in contrast to glucose-based oral rehydration solutions, which have been implicated as a contributing factor to diarrhea in cancer patients. We hypothesize that an AA-ORS may mitigate ITID via safer and more economically viable means than the current standard of care, but more controlled trials are needed to test this hypothesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Incidentally, there has been significant progress in understanding the role of polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) in modulating cancer and the  system, as well as in regulating the microbiome. Inflammation seems to be the common denominator among these seemingly unrelated biological entities- system, the microbiome, and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  (LC-PUFAs). This commentary presents a hypothesis proposing the existence of an optimal level of LC-PUFAs that nurtures the suitable gut microbiota preventing dysbiosis. This synergy between optimal LC-PUFAs and gut microbiota helps the  system overcome the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment including enhancing the efficacy of   inhibitors. A model on how LC-PUFAs (such as omega(n)-3 and n-6 fatty ) forms a synergistic triad with the  system and the microbiome in regulating inflammation to maintain homeostasis is presented. The principles underlying the hypothesis provide a basis in managing and even preventing cancer and other chronic diseases associated with inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833751>Glutaminyl cyclase is an enzymatic modifier of the CD47- SIRPα axis and a target for cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Cancer cells can evade  surveillance through the expression of inhibitory ligands that bind their cognate receptors on  effector cells. Expression of programmed death ligand 1 in tumor microenvironments is a major   for tumor-specific T  responses as it binds to programmed  death protein-1 on activated and dysfunctional T cells. The activity of myeloid cells such as macrophages and neutrophils is likewise regulated by a balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals. In particular,  surface expression of the CD47 protein creates a 'don't eat me' signal on tumor cells by binding to SIRPα expressed on myeloid cells. Using a haploid genetic screen, we here identify glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like protein (QPCTL) as a major component of the CD47-SIRPα . Biochemical analysis demonstrates that QPCTL is critical for pyroglutamate formation on CD47 at the SIRPα binding site shortly after biosynthesis. Genetic and pharmacological interference with QPCTL activity enhances antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and cellular cytotoxicity of tumor cells. Furthermore, interference with QPCTL expression leads to a major increase in neutrophil-mediated killing of tumor cells in vivo. These data identify QPCTL as a novel target to interfere with the CD47 pathway and thereby augment antibody therapy of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246309>Fine and Predictable Tuning of TALEN Gene Editing Targeting for Improved T  Adoptive Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Using a TALEN-mediated gene-editing approach, we have previously described a process for the large-scale manufacturing of "off-the-shelf" CAR T cells from third-party donor T cells by disrupting the gene encoding TCRα constant chain (TRAC). Taking advantage of a previously described strategy to control TALEN targeting based on the exclusion capacities of non-conventional RVDs, we have developed highly efficient and specific nucleases targeting a key T   , PD-1, to improve engineered CAR T cells' functionalities. Here, we demonstrate that this approach allows combined TRAC and PDCD1 TALEN processing at the desired locus while eliminating low-frequency off-site processing. Thus, by replacing few RVDs, we provide here an easy and rapid redesign of optimal TALEN combinations. We anticipate that this method can greatly benefit multiplex editing, which is of key importance especially for therapeutic applications where high editing efficiencies need to be associated with maximal specificity and safety.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

To this end, molecular approaches have been used to identify candidate targets, such as Necator americanus (Na) haemoglobinase aspartic protease-1 (APR-1), with immunogenicity profiled in canine and hamster models. We sought to accelerate the  analysis of these identified therapeutic targets by developing an appropriate mouse model. Here we demonstrate that Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb), a phylogenetically distant strongylid nematode of rodents, begins blood feeding early in its development and that immunisation with Na-APR-1 can block its growth and completion of its life . Furthermore, we identify a new haem detoxification pathway in Nb required for blood feeding that can be blocked by drugs of the quinolone family, reducing both infection burden and the associated anaemia in rodents. Collectively, our findings show that haem metabolism has potential as a  for interrupting hookworm development in early stages of the hookworm life  and that the Nippostrongylus brasiliensis rodent model is relevant for identifying novel therapeutic targets against human hookworm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30283446>Gene Expression Analysis Identifies Novel Targets for Cervical Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>Although there has been significant progress in prevention and treatment of cervical cancer, this malignancy is still a leading cause of cancer death for women. Anti-angiogenesis and immunotherapy approaches have been providing survival benefits, however, response rates and durability of response need to be improved. There is a clear need for combination therapies that increase effectiveness of these agents and further improve patient outcome. Previous studies have largely focused on gene expression and molecular pathways in untreated cervix cancer. The goal of this study was to evaluate cancer-specific molecular pathways and their correlation with tumor  profile in recurrent cervical cancer. Tumor and adjacent normal tissues were used to identify potential combination therapy targets. We found that DNA damage repair pathway genes were significantly overexpressed in the tumor. Based on our results and other recent investigations, we suggest that combination   and PARP inhibitor therapy is a high priority consideration for patients with recurrent, previously treated cervical cancer. We also show that multiple epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes, including MAP2K4, ID2, JAK1, FGF2, PIK3R1, AKT3, FGF13, and STAT3 may be potential targets. Interestingly, high-throughput analysis of Cancer Genome Atlas data identified distinct targets, including Fatty  synthase FASN and Matrix Metallopeptidase 1 MMP1 as novel, promising combination therapy partners.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727885>Establishment of Novel Cells Stably Secreting Various Human IL-18 Recombinant Proteins.</a></h2><p>The immunotherapies against cancer, autoinmmune diseases or infection are remarkable development. These days programmed  death (PD)-1 antibody-induced   blockade or chimeric antigen receptor-T cells (CAR-T) have been shown to have eminent therapeutic effects on tumor development. We have focused on adoptive transfer with human gamma delta T cells for novel immunotherapies. Additionally, IL-18 is one of the cytokines that enhances cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity of human gamma delta T cells.Thus, we established novel  lines stably expressing and secreting various types of human recombinant IL-18 proteins to their culture supernatants using episomal vector. We also differentiated primary cultured human gamma delta T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes to validate biological activity of the IL-18 proteins using measuring IFN-γ by ELISA.Finally, we demonstrated that the supernatant could activate human gamma delta T cells using monitoring interferon gamma in culture medium.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29032197>Interleukin-22 attenuates double-stranded RNA-induced upregulation of PD-L1 in airway epithelial cells via a STAT3-dependent mechanism.</a></h2><p>Double-stranded RNA derived from viruses induces host  responses. PD-L1, also known as B7-H1, is an - molecule associated with the escape of viruses from host  systems, which plays a role in the persistence of viral infection, resulting in exacerbations of underlying diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Interleukin (IL)-22 is produced from various  cells and has protective properties on mucosal tissue. The binding of IL-22 to IL-22 receptor induces STAT3 activation. We investigated the effect of IL-22 on the expression in airway epithelial cells in vitro and in mouse lungs in vivo after the stimulation with an analog of viral double-stranded RNA, polyinosinic-polycytidylic  (poly I:C). Stimulation with poly I:C upregulated PD-L1 expression on BEAS-2B cells. This upregulation of PD-L1 was attenuated by IL-22 administration. STAT3 phosphorylation was induced by IL-22 and poly I:C. Treatment of cells with STAT3 siRNA abolished the effect of IL-22 on the poly I:C-induced upregulation of PD-L1. This upregulation of PD-L1 was also attenuated by IL-11, a cytokine inducing STAT3 phosphorylation, in BEAS-2B cells. In mouse lung cells in vivo, IL-22 suppressed poly I:C-induced upregulation of PD-L1. These results suggest that IL-22 attenuates virus-induced upregulation of PD-L1 in airway epithelial cells via a STAT3-dependent mechanism.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, we demonstrate the design of the -adjuvant nanodrug carriers on the basis of poly(ethylene glycol)- block-poly(lactic- co-glycolic ) copolymer-encapsulated FeO superparticles (SPs), in which imiquimod (R837), a kind of Toll-like receptor 7 agonist, is loaded. The nanodrug carriers are defined as FeO-R837 SPs. The multitasking FeO-R837 SPs can destroy the 4T1 breast tumor by photothermal therapy (PTT) under near-infrared laser irradiation to generate the tumor-associated antigens because of the high efficiency of tumor magnetic attraction ability and photothermal effect. The PTT also triggers the release of R837 as the adjuvant to trigger a strong antitumor  response. By further combining with the  blockade adjusted by programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody, the FeO-R837 SP-involved PTT cannot only eliminate the primary tumors but also prevent tumor metastasis to lungs/liver. Meanwhile, this synergistic therapy also shows abscopal effects by completely inhibiting the growth of untreated distant tumors through effectively triggering the tumors infiltrated by CD45 leukocytes. Such findings suggest that FeO-R837 SP-involved PTT can significantly potentiate the systemic therapeutic efficiency of PD-L1  blockade therapy by activating both innate and adaptive  systems in the body.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29774560>High-resolution separation of monoclonal antibodies mixtures and their charge variants by an alternative and generic CZE method.</a></h2><p>The determination of mAb critical quality attributes (CQA) is crucial for their successful application in health diseases. A generic CZE method was developed for the high-resolution separation of various mAb charge variants, which are often recognized as important CQA. A dynamic coating of the capillary was obtained with polyethylene oxide (PEO), whereas Bis-Tris allowed the analysis of mAbs under native conditions at pH 7.0. The effect of PEO and Bis-Tris concentrations, as well as the nature of the acidic counter ion on the method performance was systematically studied. The %RSD on migration times was below 5% on three different CE instruments using the optimized method. Additional charge variants (in particular acidic variants) were resolved for 10 out of 17 mAbs compared to a reference CZE approach involving the use of ε-amino-caproic  (EACA), triethylenetetramine (TETA), and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC). The amount of basic and acidic charge variants of 17 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved mAbs covering a wide range of physico-chemical properties, e.g., pI between 8.0 and 9.4 and different hydrophobicity, were mainly comprised between 5-15% and 15-30%, respectively.

Val-boroPro is a non-selective inhibitor of post-proline-cleaving serine proteases, and the inhibition of the highly related cytosolic serine proteases Dpp8 and Dpp9 (Dpp8/9) by Val-boroPro was recently demonstrated to trigger an immunostimulatory form of programmed  death known as pyroptosis selectively in monocytes and macrophages.

Individuals with heterozygous mutations in CTLA-4 have a complex phenotype typically characterized by antibody deficiency alongside variable autoimmunity. Despite severe disease in some individuals, others remain largely unaffected with reasons for this variation unknown. We studied a large family carrying a single point mutation in CTLA-4 leading to an amino  change R75W and compared both unaffected with affected individuals. We measured a variety of features pertaining to T  and CTLA-4 biology and observed that at the cellular level there was complete penetrance of CTLA-4 mutations. Accordingly, unaffected individuals were indistinguishable from those with disease in terms of level of CTLA-4 expression, percentage of Treg, upregulation of CTLA-4 upon stimulation and proliferation of CD4 T cells. We conclude that the wide variation in disease phenotype is influenced by  variation outside of CTLA-4 biology.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Our present study successfully constructs and expresses a fully human, bispecific, single-chain diabody (BsDb) that can bind to vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) in . Under the optimal expression conditions (methanol concentration, 1%; pH, 4.0; inoculum density, OD600 = 4, and the induction time, 96 h), the maximum production level of this BsDb is achieved at approximately 20 mg/L. The recombinant BsDb is purified in one step using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column chromatography with a purity of more than 95%. Indirect enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) and sandwich ELISA analyses show that purified BsDb can bind specifically to VEGF165 and PD-1 simultaneously with affinities of 124.78 nM and 25.07 nM, respectively. Additionally, the BsDb not only effectively inhibits VEGF165-stimulated proliferation, migration, and tube formation in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), but also significantly improves proliferation and INF-γ production of activated T cells by blocking PD-1/PD-L1 co-stimulation. Furthermore, the BsDb displays potent antitumor activity in mice bearing HT29 xenograft tumors by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and activating immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. Based on these results, we have prepared a potential bispecific antibody drug that can co-target both VEGF165 and PD-1 for the first time.

Here, we address the dilemma of using corticosteroids for the treatment of irAEs induced by ICB. ICB augments neoantigen-specific CD8 T  responses, resulting in tumor regression. In our model, simultaneous, but not late, administration of corticosteroids impaired antitumor responses with reduction of CD8 T  proliferation. Secondary challenge using tumors with/without the neoantigen showed selective progression in tumors lacking the neoantigen when corticosteroids were administered. Corticosteroids decreased low- but not high-affinity memory T cells by suppressing fatty  metabolism essential for memory T cells. In a small cohort of human melanoma patients, overall survival was shorter after treatment with CTLA-4 blockade in patients who received early corticosteroids or had low tumor mutation burden. Together, low-affinity memory T cells are dominantly suppressed by corticosteroids, necessitating careful and thoughtful corticosteroid use.© 2019 Tokunaga et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462642>Blood-brain barrier permeable nano immunoconjugates induce local  responses for glioma therapy.</a></h2><p>Brain glioma treatment with  inhibitor antibodies to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (a-CTLA-4) and programmed  death-1 (a-PD-1) was largely unsuccessful due to their inability to cross blood-brain barrier (BBB).

Polybromo 1 (PBRM1 or BAF180) is hypothesized to function as the nucleosome-recognition subunit of the PBAF chromatin-remodeling complex and is frequently mutated in clear  renal  carcinoma (ccRCC). Previous studies have applied  methods to explore the binding specificities of the six individual PBRM1 BDs. However, BD targeting to histones and the influence of neighboring BD on nucleosome recognition have not been well characterized. Here, using histone microarrays and intact nucleosomes to investigate the histone-binding characteristics of the six PBRM1 BDs individually and combined, we demonstrate that BD2 and BD4 of PBRM1 mediate binding to acetylated histone peptides and to modified recombinant and cellular nucleosomes. Moreover, we show that neighboring BDs variably modulate these chromatin interactions, with BD1 and BD5 enhancing nucleosome interactions of BD2 and BD4, respectively, whereas BD3 attenuated these interactions. We also found that binding pocket missense mutations in BD4 observed in ccRCC disrupt PBRM1-chromatin interactions and that these mutations in BD4, but not similar mutations in BD2, in the context of full-length PBRM1, accelerate ccRCC  proliferation. Taken together, our biochemical and mutational analyses have identified BD4 as being critically important for maintaining proper PBRM1 function and demonstrate that BD4 mutations increase ccRCC  growth. Because of the link between PBRM1 status and sensitivity to   inhibitor treatment, these data also suggest the relevance of BD4 as a potential clinical target.© 2018 Slaughter et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30800564>Characteristics and clinical course of type 1 diabetes mellitus related to anti-programmed  death-1 therapy.</a></h2><p>We conducted a national survey to clarify the characteristics and clinical course of type 1 diabetes related to anti-programmed  death-1 therapy.We analyzed the detailed data of 22 patients that were collected using a Japan Diabetes Society survey and a literature database search.Among the 22 patients, 11 (50.0%) met the criteria for fulminant type 1 diabetes and 11 (50.0%) met the criteria for acute-onset type 1 diabetes.

Here we describe the identification of the Pekin duck programmed death-1 orthologue (duPD-1). The duPD-1 cDNA encodes a 283-amino  polypeptide that has an amino  identity of 70%, 32% and 31% with chicken, murine and human PD-1, respectively. The duck PD-1 gene shares five conserved exons with chicken, murine and human PD-1 genes. A cluster of putative regulatory elements within the conserved region B (CR-B) of the basal promotor is conserved. Homology modeling was most compatible with the two β-sheet IgV domain structure of murine PD-1. Contact residues, shown to be critical for binding of the respective human and murine PD-1 ligands are mostly conserved between avian and mammalian species, whereas residues that define the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) are highly conserved across higher vertebrates and frog. Constitutive expression of duPD-1 transcripts was predominantly found in lymphocyte-rich tissues, and mitogen-stimulation of duck peripheral blood mononuclear cells transiently increased duPD-1 mRNA expression. A soluble duPD-1 protein was expressed and shown to engage the identified duck PD-1 ligands. Our observations show considerable evolutionary conservation between mammalian and avian PD-1 orthologues. This work will facilitate further investigation of the role of PD-1 signaling in adaptive immunity in the Pekin duck, a non-mammalian vertebrate and pathogen host with relevance for human and animal health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, most neoantigens result from random mutations and are patient specific, and some cancers contain few mutations to serve as potential antigens. We describe a patient with stage IV acral melanoma who achieved a complete response following adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Tumor exome sequencing surprisingly revealed fewer than 30 nonsynonymous somatic mutations, including oncogenic BRAFV600E. Analysis of the specificity of TILs identified rare CD4+ T cells specific for BRAFV600E and diverse CD8+ T cells reactive to nonmutated self-antigens. These specificities increased in blood after TIL transfer and persisted long-term, suggesting they contributed to the effective antitumor  response. Gene transfer of the BRAFV600E-specific T  receptor (TCR) conferred recognition of class II MHC-positive cells expressing the BRAF mutation. Therapy with TCR-engineered BRAFV600E-specific CD4+ T cells may have direct antitumor effects and augment CD8+ T  responses to self- and/or mutated tumor antigens in patients with BRAF-mutated cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28594868>Design of short peptides to block BTLA/HVEM interactions for promoting anticancer T- responses.</a></h2><p>Antibody based - blockade therapy is a major breakthrough in oncology, leading to clinical benefit for cancer patients. Among the growing family of inhibitory receptors, the B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), which interacts with herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), is a promising target for immunotherapy. Indeed, BTLA inhibits T- proliferation and cytokine production. The crystal structure of the BTLA/HVEM complex has shown that the HVEM(26-38) fragment is directly involved in protein binding. We designed and analyzed the capacity of several analogs of this fragment to block the ligation between BTLA and HVEM, using competitive ELISA and cellular assay. We found that the HVEM(23-39) peptide can block BTLA/HVEM ligation. However, the blocking ability was due to the Cys encompassed in this peptide and that even free cysteine targeted the BTLA protein and blocked its interaction with HVEM. These data highlight a Cys-related artefact in vitro, which should be taken in consideration for future development of BTLA/HVEM blocking compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30617039>Exploiting FAsting-mimicking Diet and MEtformin to Improve the Efficacy of Platinum-pemetrexed Chemotherapy in Advanced LKB1-inactivated Lung Adenocarcinoma: The FAME Trial.</a></h2><p>Advanced lung adenocarcinoma with inactive liver kinase B1 (LKB1) tumor suppressor protein is associated with poor response to   inhibitors and molecularly targeted agents, and with dismal patient prognosis. LKB1 is a central orchestrator of cancer  metabolism, and halts tumor growth/proliferation during metabolic stress. Recent preclinical evidence suggests that LKB1-inactive lung adenocarcinoma is highly sensitive to metformin, a safe and low-cost antidiabetic compound that inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The effects of metformin can be enhanced by nutrient deprivation (ie, glucose, amino ), which reduces intracellular levels of ATP and anabolic precursors and can be achieved by the fasting mimicking diet (FMD). Noticeably, metformin also prevents resistance to cisplatin in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of LKB1-inactive lung adenocarcinoma. Based on such preclinical evidence, the phase II FAME trial was designed to test the hypothesis that the addition of metformin, with or without cyclic FMD, to standard platinum-based chemotherapy improves the progression-free survival of patients with advanced, LKB-1 inactive lung adenocarcinoma. Enrolled patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive cisplatin/carboplatin and pemetrexed with the addition of metformin alone (Arm A) or metformin plus FMD (Arm B). The FAME study will use a "pick-the-winner" design with the aim of establishing which of the 2 experimental treatments is superior in terms of antitumor efficacy and safety. The primary assumption of the study is that the combination of the 2 experimental treatments shall improve median progression-free survival from 7.6 months (historical data with chemotherapy alone) to 12 months. Secondary study endpoints are: objective response rate, overall survival, treatment tolerability, and compliance to the experimental treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although CYP has been shown to pose toxic effects in some  cells, as of now the immunotoxicity of CYP on  progenitor cells has not been well studied. In this study, we evaluated the immunotoxicity of β-CYP and 3-PBA on the human promyelocytic leukemia  line, HL-60. Both β-CYP and 3-PBA reduced  viability. In addition, both β-CYP and 3-PBA stimulated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while only β-CYP induced   arrest in G1 stage. Moreover, exposure to β-CYP and 3-PBA at 100 μM inhibited all-trans retinoic  (ATRA)-induced mRNA expressions of the granulocytic differentiation-related genes, CD11b and CSF-3R. Furthermore, exposure to β-CYP and 3-PBA resulted in a downregulation of the granulocytic differentiation promoting transcriptional factors, PU.1 and C/EBPε. Furthermore, we found that β-CYP and 3-PBA exposure led to elevated levels of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and that pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) blocked the toxic effects caused by β-CYP and 3-PBA. The results obtained in the present study provide evidence showing the immunotoxic effects of β-CYP and 3-PBA on promyelocytic cells as well as its possible underlying mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30623363>Targeting Colon Cancers with Mutated BRAF and Microsatellite Instability.</a></h2><p>The subgroup of colon cancer (CRC) characterized by mutation in the BRAF gene and high mutation rate in the genomic DNA sequence, known as the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype, accounts for roughly 10% of the patients and derives from polyps with a serrated morphology. In this review, both features are discussed with regard to therapeutic opportunities. The most prevalent cancer-associated BRAF mutation is BRAF V600E that causes constitutive activation of the pro-proliferative MAPK pathway. Unfortunately, the available BRAF-specific inhibitors had little clinical benefit for metastatic CRC patients due to adaptive MAPK reactivation. Recent contributions for the development of new combination therapy approaches to pathway inhibition will be highlighted. In addition, we review the promising role of the recently developed   therapy for the treatment of this CRC subtype. The MSI phenotype of this subgroup results from an inactivated DNA mismatch repair system and leads to frameshift mutations with translation of new amino  stretches and the generation of neo-antigens. This most likely explains the observed high degree of infiltration by tumour-associated lymphocytes. As cytotoxic lymphocytes are already part of the tumour environment, their activation by   therapy approaches is highly promising.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354693>The evolving role of pemetrexed disodium for the treatment of non-small  lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) remains one of the big cancer killers, despite the introduction of a number of approved therapeutics in recent times.

During the last couple of years, the advent of direct oral antivirals has allowed pursuing global HCV eradication. In an unprecedented manner, these drugs cure more than 95% of hepatitis C patients when given for only 2-3 months. The enthusiasm on HCV has renewed the interest for curative strategies for both HIV and HBV. However, important biological differences between all three viruses may preclude envisioning a similar rapid success for either HIV or HBV than for HCV infection. As shown in figure 1, once infection of targeted cells has occurred, the viral genetic material only replicates in the cytosol for HCV whereas it enters the nucleus and integrates into the chromosomes as provirus for HIV or is converted in a circular covalently closed form (cccDNA) for HBV (Fig. 1). Blocking viral nucleic  replication for a minimum lag of time allows definitive clearance of HCV infection, with degradation of residual cytoplasmic HCV-RNA strands. In contrast, blocking viral replication has only a transient effect on HIV or HBV, as mRNA expression resumes following treatment discontinuation, given the stability of the HIV provirus or the HBV cccDNA, respectively. The European Liver meeting took held in Paris on April 2018. A relatively large number of presentations addressed distinct new hepatitis B therapeutic strategies. Table 1 summarizes some of the molecules that have been investigated so far with more promising results, grouping them into distinct drug classes (Soriano et al. Exp Op Inv Drugs 2017;26:843-51), based on their distinct mechanism of action and targeted steps in the HBV life  (Fig. 2). Considering the pros and cons of novel HBV therapeutic candidates, it has become apparent new HBV gene therapies among the most attractive. Several advances have contributed to position gene therapy in front within the experimental HBV armamentarium. First, progresses in delivery systems, including the use of polymers and nanoformulations have allowed developing easier forms of administration that now are becoming subcutaneous and monthly. Second, the synthetic production of oligonucleotide formulations has reduced costs. Third, the specificity against HBV is higher than for other experimental agents, as  modulators that enhance innate immunity, such as TLR agonists (i.e., GS-9620) or  inhibitors (i.e., nivolumab). Fourth, significant declines in serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are demonstrated during gene therapy, which have never been seen using the most potent polymerase inhibitors (i.e., tenofovir or entecavir). Finally, unanticipated significant reductions in cccDNA are seen with HBV gene therapy, most likely as prove of an indirect benefit of waning the immunosuppressive effect of large over amounts of HBsAg released by infected hepatocytes that contributes to T- exhaustion. In a pioneering study, Roche was the first to publish the potent effect of an oral small molecule that blocked HBV gene expression (Mueller et al. J Hepatol 2018;68:412-20). The drug belonged to the dihydroquinolizinone class, and directly or indirectly modified viral RNAs, promoting their degradation. This posttranscriptional silencing was accompanied by rapid drops in HBV-DNA and more importantly in serum HBsAg in the humanized mice. However, Roche decided to discontinue any further clinical development of the drug. Nowadays, two major groups of agents are being developed as HBV gene therapies. At this time, interference RNA (iRNA) molecules and nucleic  polymers (NAPs) are the most promising. Overall, iRNA is double-stranded RNA molecules, 20 nucleotides long. One strand matches a segment of specific HBV mRNA and induces its degradation. Several iRNA molecules have entered into Phase II clinical trials (Flisiak et al. Exp Op Biol Ther, in press), including ARB-1467 and AB-729 (Arbutus), ARO-HBV (Arrowhead), ALN-HBV (Alnylam), and IONIS-HBVRx (Ionis). In most cases, they are tested as part of combination therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogs and/or peginterferon. NAPs are phosphorothioate 40 length oligonucleotides that no map any HBV sequence. However, they interact with a liver host target protein (apolipoprotein-like) and result in specific inhibition of HBV mRNAs. This is followed by rapid suppression of HBsAg release (Roehl et al. Mol Ther Nuc  2017;8:1-12). In a pilot study with intravenous REP-2139, investigators from Replicor demonstrated strong reductions in HBV-DNA along with significant drops in HBsAg and seroconversion in some patients. More interestingly was the recognition of significant reductions in hepatic cccDNA, most likely a result of an indirect effect following the removal of large amounts of HBsAg from the bloodstream that contributes to impaired T- responses in chronic hepatitis B patients (Bazinet et al. EASL, Paris 2018; abstract FRI-343). An improved NAP, named REP-2165 and subcutaneous administration are currently being tested.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30097571>A dormant TIL phenotype defines non-small  lung carcinomas sensitive to   blockers.</a></h2><p>The biological determinants of sensitivity and resistance to   blockers are not completely understood. To elucidate the role of intratumoral T-cells and their association with the tumor genomic landscape, we perform paired whole exome DNA sequencing and multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) in pre-treatment samples from non-small  lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients treated with PD-1 axis blockers. QIF is used to simultaneously measure the level of CD3+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), in situ T- proliferation (Ki-67 in CD3) and effector capacity (Granzyme-B in CD3). Elevated mutational load, candidate class-I neoantigens or intratumoral CD3 signal are significantly associated with favorable response to therapy. Additionally, a "dormant" TIL signature is associated with survival benefit in patients treated with   blockers characterized by elevated TILs with low activation and proliferation. We further demonstrate that dormant TILs can be reinvigorated upon PD-1 blockade in a patient-derived xenograft model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30225435>Association of -Mediated Cerebellitis With   Inhibitor Therapy.</a></h2><p>-mediated encephalitis related to   inhibitor therapy is a rare but increasingly described condition that can cause significant morbidity. There are several reported cases in the literature but no previously described cases of -mediated cerebellitis. We describe a case of acute cerebellitis that developed in a 20-year-old man with primary refractory Hodgkin lymphoma being treated with the   inhibitor nivolumab. After exposure to 3 cycles of nivolumab, the patient had acute onset of headache, ataxia, nausea, and vomiting, with imaging findings of cerebellar edema, early tonsillar herniation, and early hydrocephalus. -mediated cerebellar encephalitis was suspected and high-dose dexamethasone therapy (8 mg every 6 hours) was initiated. Within 4 days of dexamethasone therapy, his symptoms greatly improved with near-complete resolution of symptoms after a 4-week taper. Differential diagnosis of his condition included viral cerebellitis and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. In cerebellar encephalitis suspected to be due to   inhibitor therapy, prompt recognition and early initiation of high-dose corticosteroids is essential for symptom resolution and treatment success, including the prevention of hydrocephalus and tonsillar herniation. Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines to guide the initial dose, type, or duration of corticosteroids.

Thus, new targets acting on T cells are needed. CD33-related sialic -binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) are pattern-recognition  receptors binding to a range of sialoglycan ligands, which appear to function as self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs) that suppress autoimmune responses. Siglecs are expressed at very low levels on normal T cells, and these receptors were not until recently considered as interesting targets on T cells for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we show an upregulation of Siglecs, including Siglec-9, on tumor-infiltrating T cells from non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal, and ovarian cancer patients. Siglec-9-expressing T cells coexpressed several inhibitory receptors, including PD-1. Targeting of the sialoglycan-SAMP/Siglec pathway in vitro and in vivo resulted in increased anticancer immunity. T  expression of Siglec-9 in NSCLC patients correlated with reduced survival, and Siglec-9 polymorphisms showed association with the risk of developing lung and colorectal cancer. Our data identify the sialoglycan-SAMP/Siglec pathway as a potential target for improving T  activation for immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642767>STING Activation and its Application in Immuno-Oncology.</a></h2><p>Recent regulatory approval of several   inhibitors has ushered a new era of cancer immunotherapies with the promise of achieving a durable response. This represents a paradigm shift in cancer treatment from directly targeting tumor cells to harnessing the power of a patient's own  system to destroy them. The cGAS-STING pathway is the major cytosolic dsDNA sensing pathway that plays a pivotal role in the innate antitumor response. With a fundamentally different mode of action (MOA) than   modulators, STING activation can potentially enhance tumor immunogenicity and improve patient responses by synergizing with existing anti-cancer drugs.

Many established risk factors were identified for the disease, including genetic and external risk factors. Radiographic survey, endoscopic examination and urine cytology remained the most important diagnostic modalities. In localized upper tract urothelial carcinomas, radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision are the gold standard for large, high-grade and suspected invasive tumors of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter, whereas kidney-sparing surgeries should be considered in patients with low-risk disease. Advances in technology have given endoscopic surgery an important role, not only in diagnosis, but also in treatment. Although platinum-based combination chemotherapy is efficacious in advanced or metastatic disease, current established chemotherapy regimens are toxic and lack a sustained response.   inhibitors have led to a new era of treatment for advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinomas. The remarkable results achieved thus far show that immunotherapy will likely be the future treatment paradigm. The combination of   inhibitors and other agents is another inspiring avenue to explore that could benefit even more patients.

The founder gene of the family is thought to be an ancestor of the inhibitory   molecule CEACAM1. Comprehensive analyses of mammalian genomes showed that the CEA gene family is subject to tremendous gene family expansion and contraction events in different mammalian species. While in some species (e.g. rabbits) less than three CEACAM1 related genes exist, were in others (certain microbat species) up to 100 CEACAM1 paralogs identified. We have recently reported that the horse has also an extended CEA gene family. Since mechanisms of gene family expansion and diversification are not well understood we aimed to analyze the equine CEA gene family in detail.We found that the equine CEA gene family contains 17 functional CEACAM1-related genes. Nine of them were secreted molecules and eight CEACAMs contain transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain exons, the latter being in the focus of the present report. Only one (CEACAM41) gene has exons coding for activating signaling motifs all other CEACAM1 paralogs contain cytoplasmic exons similar to that of the inhibitory receptor CEACAM1. However, cloning of cDNAs showed that only one CEACAM1 paralog contain functional immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in its cytoplasmic tail. Three receptors have acquired a stop codon in the transmembrane domain and two have lost their inhibitory motifs due to alternative splicing events. In addition, alternative splicing eliminated the transmembrane exon sequence of the putative activating receptor, rendering it to a secreted molecule. Transfection of eukaryotic cells with FLAG-tagged alternatively spliced CEACAMs indicates that they can be expressed in vivo. Thus detection of CEACAM41 mRNA in activated PBMC suggests that CEACAM41 is secreted by lymphoid cells upon activation.The results of our study demonstrate that alternative splicing after gene duplication is a potent mechanism to accelerate functional diversification of the equine CEA gene family members. This potent mechanism has created novel CEACAM receptors with unique signaling capacities and secreted CEACAMs which potentially enables equine lymphoid cells to control distantly located  cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29288206>IL-4-Induced Gene 1: A Negative   Controlling B  Differentiation and Activation.</a></h2><p>Emerging data highlight the crucial role of enzymes involved in amino  metabolism in   biology. IL-4-induced gene-1 (IL4I1), a secreted l-phenylalanine oxidase expressed by APCs, has been detected in B cells, yet its immunoregulatory role has only been explored on T cells. In this study, we show that IL4I1 regulates multiple steps in B  physiology. Indeed, IL4I1 knockout mice exhibit an accelerated B  egress from the bone marrow, resulting in the accumulation of peripheral follicular B cells. They also present a higher serum level of natural Igs and self-reactive Abs. We also demonstrate that IL4I1 produced by B cells themselves controls the germinal center reaction, plasma  differentiation, and specific Ab production in response to T dependent Ags, SRBC, and NP-KLH. In vitro, IL4I1-deficient B cells proliferate more efficiently than their wild-type counterparts in response to BCR cross-linking. Moreover, the absence of IL4I1 increases activation of the Syk-Akt-S6kinase signaling pathway and calcium mobilization, and inhibits SHP-1 activity upon BCR engagement, thus supporting that IL4I1 negatively controls BCR-dependent activation. Overall, our study reveals a new perspective on IL4I1 as a key regulator of B  biology.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30062658>(-)-4-O-(4-O-β-D-glucopyranosylcaffeoyl) Quinic  Inhibits the Function of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells to Enhance the Efficacy of Anti-PD1 against Colon Cancer.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy in the clinic has demonstrated its potential to control cancer through disinhibiting the  system, especially for   inhibitors such as anti-programmed  death protein 1/anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1). However, although these new immunotherapies have resulted in durable clinical responses in various cancers, multiple mechanisms of  resistance and suppression exist in tumors. One significant barrier to efficacy of anti-PD1 against colon cancer may be the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into the tumor microenvironment. Here we demonstrated functional inhibition of G-MDSC with (-)-4-O-(4-O-β-D-glucopyranosylcaffeoyl) quinic  (QA), an inhibitor of PI3Kδ/γ, reshaped the tumor  microenvironment and promoted cytotoxic T -mediated tumor regression, resultantly enhancing responses to anti-PD1 treatment in colon tumor model.A syngeneic colon tumor mouse model was used to study the effects of QA on tumor  microenvironment and its potential synergistic effects with anti-PD1 blockade.QA treatment inhibited G-MDSC function in the tumor tissue.

The Cancer Genome Atlas identified hypermutated CRCs with somatic mutations in DNA polymerase ε (POLE) with mutation burdens exceeding that of MMR-deficient CRCs.To identify the morphologic, immunophenotypic and molecular features of POLE mutated CRCs, 63 consecutive MMR-intact CRCs were evaluated by Sanger sequencing for POLE exonuclease domain mutations in exons 9, 11, 13 and 14 and confirmed by next generation sequencing. Tumor  microenvironment and immunoscores were assessed in POLE-mutated CRCs using immunohistochemistry to detect CD3+/CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and compared to 59 non-POLE mutated MMR-intact CRC, 10 non-POLE mutated MMR-deficient CRCs, and 223 normal colonic mucosa.4.8% CRC (4 MMR-intact primary and 1 MMR-intact metastasis) harbored POLE mutations in amino  286 in exon 9 (p.P286R) or exon 13 (p.V411L). POLE mutated CRCs arose in the transverse colon and rectum, were male-predominant, younger, and showed increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and  cells at the tumor-stromal interface. The patient with metastatic POLE mutated CRC was placed on PD-1 inhibitor treatment with marked and sustained response. These data indicate that POLE mutated CRCs have hypermutated phenotypes despite MMR-intact status, with mutation burdens higher than that in microsatellite unstable CRCs. Given the recent approval for treatment of microsatellite unstable cancer with   inhibitors, assessment of POLE status may help guide therapeutic decisions for hypermutated tumors with intact MMR that would otherwise be missed by routine testing.This article is protected by copyright.

Accumulating evidence indicates that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a major factor responsible for immunosuppression in patients with cancer. Therefore, identifying effective therapies that deplete or modulate MDSCs is essential. In this study, we focus on the anticonvulsant drug valproic  (VPA), which has additional activities including anticancer and immunoregulation by inhibition of histone deacetylases. We showed that VPA decreased the proportion of polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs in vitro and showed for the first time that VPA greatly attenuated the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, we demonstrated that in vitro differentiated VPA-conditioned MDSCs exhibited impaired ability to stimulate tumor progression in vivo. We also showed the possible involvement of several mechanisms in the VPA-induced attenuation of the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs, including the interleukin-4 receptor-α (IL-4Rα)/arginase axis, programmed  death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathways, and retinoblastoma 1 (Rb1) derepression.

The altered metabolic landscape of the tumor microenvironment can suppress the infiltration of  cells and other functions of antitumor immunity through the production of -suppressive metabolites. Metabolic dysregulation in cancer cells further affects the expression of  surface markers, which interferes with  surveillance.   therapies have revolutionized the standard of care for some patients with cancer, but disease in many others is resistant to immunotherapy. Specific metabolic pathways involved in immunotherapy resistance include PI3K-Akt-mTOR, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), adenosine, JAK/STAT, and Wnt/Beta-catenin. Depletion of essential amino  such as glutamine and tryptophan and production of metabolites like kynurenine in the tumor microenvironment also blunt   function. Targeted therapies against metabolic  could work in synergy with   therapy. This combined strategy could be refined by profiling patients' mutation status before treatment and identifying the optimal sequencing of therapies. This personalized combinatorial approach, which has yet to be explored, may well pave the way for overcoming resistance to immunotherapy.Copyright © 2018.

The PDA tumor microenvironment contains infiltrating  cells including cytotoxic T cells; however, there is an overall immunosuppressive milieu. Hypoxia is a known element of the solid tumor microenvironment and may promote tumor survival. Through various mechanisms including, but not limited to, those mediated by HIF-1α, hypoxia also leads to increased tumor proliferation and metabolic changes. Furthermore, epithelial to mesenchymal transition is promoted through several pathways, including NOTCH and c-MET, regulated by hypoxia. Hypoxia-promoted changes also contribute to the immunosuppressive phenotype seen in many different  types within the microenvironment and thereby may inhibit an effective  system response to PDA. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and myofibroblasts appear to contribute to the recruitment of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and B cells in PDA via cytokines increased due to hypoxia. PSCs also increase collagen secretion in response to HIF-1α, which promotes a fibrotic stroma that alters T  homing and migration. In hypoxic environments, B cells contribute to cytotoxic T  exhaustion and produce chemokines to attract more immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. MDSCs inhibit T  metabolism by hoarding key amino , modulate T  homing by cleaving L-selectin, and prevent T  activation by increasing PD-L1 expression. Immunosuppressive M2 phenotype macrophages promote T  anergy via increased nitric oxide (NO) and decreased arginine in hypoxia. Increased numbers of regulatory T cells are seen in hypoxia which prevent effector T  activation through cytokine production and increased CTLA-4. Effective immunotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and other solid tumors will need to help counteract the immunosuppressive nature of hypoxia-induced changes in the tumor microenvironment. Promising studies will look at combination therapies involving  inhibitors, chemokine inhibitors, and possible targeting of hypoxia. While no model is perfect, assuring that models incorporate the effects of hypoxia on cancer cells, stromal cells, and effector  cells will be crucial in developing successful therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28761949>  Inhibitor Therapy in a Liver Transplant Recipient With Melanoma.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008436>Majority of -Mutant and -Deficient Colorectal Carcinomas Achieve Clinical Benefit From   Inhibitor Therapy and Are Microsatellite Instability-High.</a></h2><p>Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) show high rates of response to   inhibitors (IOs).  mutations and protein loss have been proposed as causes of resistance to IOs, yet they are enriched in MSI-H CRC.

We hypothesized that tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells harbor latent antitumor activity that can be reactivated using combination immunotherapy.Preserved human PDA specimens were analyzed using multiplex IHC (mIHC) and T- receptor (TCR) sequencing. Fresh tumor was treated in organotypic slice culture to test the effects of combination PD-1 and CXCR4 blockade. Slices were analyzed using IHC, flow cytometry, and live fluorescent microscopy to assess tumor kill, in addition to T- expansion and mobilization.mIHC demonstrated fewer CD8 T cells in juxtatumoral stroma containing carcinoma cells than in stroma devoid of them. Using TCR sequencing, we found clonal expansion in each tumor; high-frequency clones had multiple DNA rearrangements coding for the same amino  binding sequence, which suggests response to common tumor antigens. Treatment of fresh human PDA slices with combination PD-1 and CXCR4 blockade led to increased tumor  death concomitant with lymphocyte expansion. Live microscopy after combination therapy demonstrated CD8 T- migration into the juxtatumoral compartment and rapid increase in tumor  apoptosis.Endogenous tumor-reactive T cells are present within the human PDA tumor microenvironment and can be reactivated by combined blockade of PD-1 and CXCR4.

T lymphocytes have the remarkable plasticity that allows them to shape their metabolism to adapt to extracellular and intracellular cues, a process that involves molecular modules referred to as "metabolic checkpoints" that sense metabolic signals and transduce effector messages. These metabolic checkpoints may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for immune modulation. Chemical immunosuppressive drugs including mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine), and purine and pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors (6-mercaptopurine, mycophenolic acid, and methotrexate) are widely prescribed for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and for controlling alloimmunity in interfering with the signals that activate and allow T cells to proliferate. Emerging evidence indicates that these drugs also target T-cell metabolism and metabolic checkpoints, which, as a consequence, could contribute to their immunosuppressive effects. These examples raise the issue of how the modulation of these metabolic checkpoints can regulate T-cell activation, differentiation, and function. In this review we highlight emerging concepts about the modulation of metabolic reprogramming in T-cell responses by immunosuppressive drugs and how potential therapeutic interventions influence T-cell fate and effector function.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the efficacy of radiotherapy is usually limited by tumor hypoxia-associated radiation resistance. Moreover, as a local treatment technique, radiotherapy can hardly control tumor metastases, the major cause of cancer death. Herein, core-shell nanoparticles based poly(lactic-co-glycolic)  (PLGA) are fabricate, by encapsulating water-soluble catalase (Cat), an enzyme that can decompose H O to generate O , inside the inner core, and loading hydrophobic imiquimod (R837), a Toll-like-receptor-7 agonist, within the PLGA shell. The formed PLGA-R837@Cat nanoparticles can greatly enhance radiotherapy efficacy by relieving the tumor hypoxia and modulating the -suppressive tumor microenvironment. The tumor-associated antigens generated postradiotherapy-induced immunogenic  death in the presence of such R837-loaded adjuvant nanoparticles will induce strong antitumor  responses, which together with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4)  blockade will be able to effectively inhibit tumor metastases by a strong abscopal effect. Moreover, a long term immunological memory effect to protect mice from tumor rechallenging is observed post such treatment. This work thus presents a unique nanomedicine approach as a next-generation radiotherapy strategy to enable synergistic whole-body therapeutic responses after local treatment, greatly promising for clinical translation.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Patient prognosis is poor when treated with CHOP, and there is an unmet need for new drugs. Several agents have been developed for PTCL, and their use is the subject of this review.Phase 2 studies demonstrated the activity of new drugs in Relapsed/refractory PTCL. Only four compounds were approved by the food and drug administration: romidepsin and belinostat, which are epigenetic modifiers, the antifolate agent pralatrexate, the immuno-conjugate brentuximab vedotin. New combinations have been tested, but the results were disappointing. Given the latest progress in biology, targeted agents are evaluated in different subtypes of PTCL. Relapsed anaplastic large- lymphoma exhibits improved prognosis with the approved anti-CD30 drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin. Localized nasal NK/T is treated with radiotherapy and nonanthracycline chemotherapy with L-asparaginase. Recently,   inhibitors demonstrated activity in NK/T lymphoma and can be used in elderly patients.Treatment remains a challenge for PTCL, and several targeted drugs provide new approaches.

However, the factors that determine the ratio of HDR to NHEJ products after CRISPR/Cas9 editing remain unclear, and methods by which the proportion of HDR products can be increased have not yet been fully established. We systematically analyzed the HDR and NHEJ products after genome editing using various modified guide RNAs (gRNAs) and Cas9 variants with an enhanced conformational  to improve the fidelity at endogenous gene loci in HEK293T cells and HeLa cells. We found that these modified gRNAs and Cas9 variants were able to enhance HDR in both single-nucleotide substitutions and a multi-kb DNA fragment insertion.

There are no approved circulating diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers, nor novel therapies like   inhibitors for glioblastoma, and chemotherapy brings only minimal survival benefits. The development of molecular biology led to the discovery of new potential diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets, offering the premise to detect patients at earlier stages and overcome the current poor prognosis.One potential diagnostic and therapeutic breakthrough might come from microRNAs (miRNAs). It is well-known that miRNAs play a role in the initiation and development of various types of cancer, including glioblastoma. The review aims to answer the following questions concerning the role of RNA theranostics for brain tumors: (1) which miRNAs are the best candidates to become early diagnostic and prognostic circulating biomarkers?; (2) how to deliver the therapeutic agents in the CNS to overcome the BBB?; (3) which are the best methods to restore/inhibit miRNAs?Because of the proven roles played by miRNAs in gliomagenesis and of their capacity to pass from the CNS tissue into the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we propose miRNAs as ideal diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.

Blockade of the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 shows exciting clinical responses in a fraction of cancer patients and the success makes PD-1 as a valuable target in   therapy. For the rational design of PD-1 targeting modulators, the ligand binding mechanism of PD-1 should be well understood in prior.In this study, we applied 50 ns molecular dynamics simulations to observe the structural properties of PD-1 molecule in both apo and ligand bound states, and we studied the structural features of PD-1 in human and mouse respectively.The results showed that the apo hPD-1 was more flexible than that in PD-L1 bound state. We unexpectedly found that K135 was important for binding energy although it was not at the binding interface. Moreover, the residues which stabilized the interactions with PD-L1 were distinguished. Taking the dynamic features of these residues into account, we identified several residual sites where mutations may gain the function of ligand binding. The in vitro binding experiments revealed the mutants M70I, S87 W, A129L, A132L, and K135 M were better in ligand binding than the wild type PD-1.The structural information from MD simulation combined with in silico mutagenesis provides guidance to design engineered PD-1 mutants to modulate the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30081936>Can IDO activity predict primary resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment in NSCLC?</a></h2><p>  inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment paradigm of highly lethal malignancies like advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC), demonstrating long-term tumour control and extended patient survival. Unfortunately, only 25-30% of patients experience a durable benefit, while the vast majority demonstrate primary or acquired resistance. Recently, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity has been proposed as a possible mechanism of resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment leading to an immunosuppressive microenvironment.Pre-treatment serum concentrations of tryptophan (trp) and kynurenine (kyn) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in NSCLC patients treated with second-line nivolumab. The IDO activity was expressed with kyn/trp ratio. The associations between kyn/trp ratio and early progression, performance status (PS), age, sex, brain metastases, pleural effusion, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using Spearman test and Mann-Whitney test.Twenty-six NSCLC patients were included in our study; 14 of them (54%) presented early progression (< 3 months) to nivolumab treatment. The median value of kyn/trp ratio was 0.06 µg/ml and the median value of quinolinic  was 68.45 ng/ml. A significant correlation between early progression and higher kyn/trp ratio and quinolinic  concentration was observed (p = 0.017 and p = 0.005, respectively). Patients presenting lower values of kyn/trp ratio and quinolinic  levels showed longer PFS (median PFS not reached versus 3 months; HR: 0.3; p = 0.018) and OS (median OS not reached vs 3 months; HR: 0.18; p = 0.0005).IDO activity, expressed as kyn/trp ratio, is associated with response to immunotherapy; in particular, higher kyn/trp ratio could predict resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment. These preliminary results suggest the possibility of using anti-PD-1 plus IDO inhibitor in those patients with high level of kyn/trp ratio.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524529>The sialoglycan-Siglec glyco-  - a target for improving innate and adaptive anti-cancer immunity.</a></h2><p>: During cancer progression, tumor cells develop several mechanisms to prevent killing and to shape the  system into a tumor-promoting environment.

Despite this opportunity, identification of protein-protein interfaces remains challenging. We have previously developed a method that relies on coating protein surfaces with small-molecule dyes to discriminate between solvent-accessible protein surfaces and hidden interface regions. Dye-bound, solvent-accessible protein regions resist trypsin digestion, whereas hidden interface regions are revealed by denaturation and sequenced by MS. The small-molecule dyes bind promiscuously and with high affinity, but their binding mechanism is unknown. Here, we report on the optimization of a novel dye probe used in protein painting, Fast Blue B + naphthionic , and show that its affinity for proteins strongly depends on hydrophobic moieties that we call here "hydrophobic clamps." We demonstrate the utility of this probe by sequencing the protein-protein interaction regions between the Hippo pathway protein Yes-associated protein 2 (YAP2) and tight junction protein 1 (TJP1 or ZO-1), uncovering interactions via the known binding domain as well as ZO-1's MAGUK domain and YAP's N-terminal proline-rich domain. Additionally, we demonstrate how residues predicted by protein painting are present exclusively in the complex interface and how these residues may guide the development of peptide inhibitors using a case study of programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed  death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1).

Recently, we demonstrated that glycan structures of serum α- glycoprotein (AGP) changed dramatically in cancer patients and that α1,3fucosylated AGP (fAGP) levels increased along with disease progression and decreased responding to chemotherapy treatments. Here, the fAGP was analyzed in sera prospectively obtained from 39 patients with advanced lung cancer who underwent immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab. Twenty-three patients had significantly high fAGP levels above the cut-off value (H-fAGP) at one month after starting the treatment and 20 patients in this group, whose tumor sizes did not decrease, maintained high fAGP levels continuously and subsequently died. However, the other 16 patients, whose fAGP levels decreased or maintained below the cut-off value (L-fAGP), survived during a 2-year observation even though 5 patients in this group had no tumor shrinkage. Accordingly, the overall survival rate was found to significantly correlate with the fAGP level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the H-fAGP was an independent risk factor for cancer progression. Therefore, the fAGP level appeared to be a reliable biomarker for predicting clinical efficacy of immunotherapy with nivolumab.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30223043>Recent advances in applying nanotechnologies for cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Cancer immunotherapy aimed at boosting cancer-specific immunoresponses to eradicate tumor cells has evolved as a new treatment modality.

Understanding the underlying molecular pathogenesis leading to hepatocellular carcinoma is a prerequisite to develop new drugs that will hamper or block the steps of these pathways. As hepatocellular carcinoma has higher arterial vascularization than normal liver, this could be a good target for novel molecular therapies. Introduction of the antiangiogenic drug sorafenib into clinical practice since 2008 has led to new perspectives in the management of this tumor. The importance of this drug lies not only in the modest gain of patients' survival, but in having opened a roadmap towards the development of new molecules and targets. Unfortunately, after the introduction of sorafenib, during the last years, a wide number of clinical trials on antiangiogenic therapies failed in achieving significant results. However, many of these trials are still ongoing and promise to improve overall survival and progression-free survival. A recent clinical trial has proven regorafenib effective in patients showing tumor progression under sorafenib, thus opening new interesting therapeutic perspectives.

Understanding the  regulatory mechanisms employed by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cells upon exposure to IFN-γ is critical for development of immunotherapy and  blockade therapy approaches. This study aims to explore the influence of myeloid maturation on IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression and on pro-leukemogenic transcription factor STAT3 signaling in AML and MDS. Stimulation of myeloid blasts' maturation by all-trans retinoic  (ATRA) or 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D) increased the CD11b fraction that expressed PD-1 ligands in response to IFN-γ. Intriguingly, STAT3 pathway was potently induced by IFN-γ and strengthened upon prolonged exposure. Nonetheless, STAT3-mediated atypical IFN-γ signaling appeared as a negligible factor for PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression. These negative influences of IFN-γ could be alleviated by a small-molecule inhibitor of STAT3, stattic, which also inhibited the upregulation of PD-L1. In conclusion, induction of myeloid maturation enhances the responsiveness of AML and MDS cells to IFN-γ. However, these malignant myeloid cells can exploit both STAT3 pathway and PD-1 ligands to survive IFN-γ-mediated immunity and maintain secondary  resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28421069>Engineering Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cells for Racing in Solid Tumors: Don't Forget the Fuel.</a></h2><p>T-cells play a critical role in tumor immunity. Indeed, the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is a predictor of favorable patient prognosis for many indications and is a requirement for responsiveness to   blockade therapy targeting programmed  death 1. For tumors lacking  infiltrate, or for which antigen processing and/or presentation has been downregulated, a promising immunotherapeutic approach is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T- therapy. CARs are hybrid receptors that link the tumor antigen specificity and affinity of an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment with signaling endodomains associated with T- activation. CAR therapy targeting CD19 has yielded extraordinary clinical responses against some hematological tumors. Solid tumors, however, remain an important challenge to CAR T-cells due to issues of homing, tumor vasculature and stromal barriers, and a range of obstacles in the tumor bed. Protumoral  infiltrate including T regulatory cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells have been well characterized for their ability to upregulate inhibitory receptors and molecules that hinder effector T-cells. A critical role for metabolic barriers in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is emerging. High glucose consumption and competition for key amino  by tumor cells can leave T-cells with insufficient energy and biosynthetic precursors to support activities such as cytokine secretion and lead to a phenotypic state of anergy or exhaustion. CAR T- expansion protocols that promote a less differentiated phenotype, combined with optimal receptor design and coengineering strategies, along with immunomodulatory therapies that also promote endogenous immunity, offer great promise in surmounting immunometabolic barriers in the TME and curing solid tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30100185>Urea  Dysregulation Generates Clinically Relevant Genomic and Biochemical Signatures.</a></h2><p>The urea  (UC) is the main pathway by which mammals dispose of waste nitrogen. We find that specific alterations in the expression of most UC enzymes occur in many tumors, leading to a general metabolic hallmark termed "UC dysregulation" (UCD). UCD elicits nitrogen diversion toward carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydrooratase (CAD) activation and enhances pyrimidine synthesis, resulting in detectable changes in nitrogen metabolites in both patient tumors and their bio-fluids. The accompanying excess of pyrimidine versus purine nucleotides results in a genomic signature consisting of transversion mutations at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. This mutational bias is associated with increased numbers of hydrophobic tumor antigens and a better response to   inhibitors independent of mutational load. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that UCD is a common feature of tumors that profoundly affects carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and immunotherapy response.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, we present a strategy to construct cancer vaccines by encapsulating -adjuvant nanoparticles with cancer  membranes modified by mannose. Poly(d,l-lactide- co-glycolide) nanoparticles are first loaded with toll-like receptor 7 agonist, imiquimod (R837). Those adjuvant nanoparticles (NP-R) are then coated with cancer  membranes (NP-R@M), whose surface proteins could act as tumor-specific antigens. With further modification with mannose moiety (NP-R@M-M), the obtained nanovaccine shows enhanced uptake by antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells, which would then be stimulated to the maturation status to trigger antitumor  responses. With great efficacy to delay tumor development as a prevention vaccine, vaccination with such NP-R@M-M in combination with -blockade therapy further demonstrates outstanding therapeutic efficacy to treat established tumors. Therefore, our work presents an innovative way to fabricate cancer nanovaccines, which in principle may be applied for a wide range of tumor types.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30176946>Treatment of mycophenolate-resistant -related organizing pneumonia with infliximab.</a></h2><p>The development of pulmonary -related adverse events (irAEs) in patients undergoing PD-(L)1 targeted  inhibitors are rare, but may be life-threatening. While many published articles and guidelines are focusing on the presentation and upfront treatment of pulmonary irAEs, the strategy in patients with late-onset pneumonia that are resistant to commonly used immunosuppressive drugs remains unclear.Here, we report the successful treatment of a mycophenolate-resistant organizing pneumonia (OP) with infliximab in a patient with metastatic melanoma after PD-1 blockade. The patient received two years of PD-1 targeted immunotherapy when he developed multiple nodular lung lesions mimicking a metastatic progression. However, wedge resection of these lesions showed defined areas of OP, which responded well to corticosteroids. Upon tapering, new foci of OP developed which were resistant to high-dose steroids and mycophenolate treatment. The TNFα antagonist infliximab led to a rapid and durable regression of the inflammatory lesions.This case describes a not well-studied situation, in which a mycophenolate-resistant PD-1 blocker-associated pneumonitis was successfully treated with a TNFα neutralizing antibody. The outcome of this case suggests that infliximab might be the preferable option compared to classical immunosuppressants in the case of steroid-resistant/-dependent late onset pulmonary irAEs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31380170>PI3Kgamma Inhibitor Attenuates Immunosuppressive Effect of Poly(l-Glutamic )-Combretastatin A4 Conjugate in Metastatic Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) have great potential for cancer treatment. Poly(l-glutamic )-combretastatin A4 conjugate (PLG-CA4) is a novel class of VDAs. Though it has notable antitumor activity, it can induce host  responses that promote tumor growth. Here, PLG-CA4 induces the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward the M2-like phenotype in 4T1 metastatic breast cancer (Control 30% vs PLG-CA4 53%;  < 0.05). Compared to the monotherapy of PLG-CA4, inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) attenuates the immunosuppressive effect of PLG-CA4 treatment by decreasing the number of M2-like TAMs (2.0 × 10 to 1.5 × 10 per tumor) and potential enhancement of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (3.0 × 10 to 5.7 × 10 per tumor). Importantly, PI3Kγ inhibitor synergizing with PLG-CA4 significantly extends the mean survival time from 52 days in monotherapy-treated mice to 61.8 days. Additionally, the combination of PLG-CA4 and PI3Kγ inhibitor improves the tumor therapeutic effect of NLG919, an inhibitor of   indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). As far as it is known, this is the first demonstrated study that VDAs induce the reshaping of macrophages to the M2-like phenotype. The findings also indicate a potential therapeutic strategy of the combination VDAs with an accurate  modifier in the tumor to reverse the  resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30379158>Delivery of 5'-triphosphate RNA with endosomolytic nanoparticles potently activates RIG-I to improve cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>RNA agonists of the retinoic  gene I (RIG-I) pathway have recently emerged as a promising class of cancer immunotherapeutics, but their efficacy is hindered by drug delivery barriers, including nuclease degradation, poor intracellular uptake, and minimal access to the cytosol where RIG-I is localized. Here, we explore the application of pH-responsive, endosomolytic polymer nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance the cytosolic delivery and immunostimulatory activity of synthetic 5' triphosphate, short, double-stranded RNA (3pRNA), a ligand for RIG-I. Delivery of 3pRNA with pH-responsive NPs with an active endosomal escape mechanism, but not control carriers lacking endosomolytic activity, significantly increased the activity of 3pRNA in dendritic cells, macrophages, and cancer  lines. In a CT26 colon cancer model, activation of RIG-I via NP delivery of 3pRNA induced immunogenic  death, triggered expression of type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased CD8+ T  infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, intratumoral (IT) delivery of NPs loaded with 3pRNA inhibited CT26 tumor growth and enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1   blockade, resulting in a 30% complete response rate and generation of immunological memory that protected against tumor rechallenge. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that pH-responsive NPs can be harnessed to strongly enhance the immunostimulatory activity and therapeutic efficacy of 3pRNA and establish endosomal escape as a critical parameter in the design of carriers for immunotherapeutic targeting of the RIG-I pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330498>  inhibitors and type 1 diabetes mellitus: a case report and systematic review.</a></h2><p>To better define the rare adverse event (AE) of diabetes mellitus associated with   inhibitors (ICI).We report the case of a lung cancer patient with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and autoimmune thyroiditis during pembrolizumab treatment. We provide a systematic review of all published cases (PubMed/Web of Science/Cochrane, through November 2018) of autoimmune diabetes mellitus related to blockade of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA 4)-, programmed  death 1 (PD 1) receptor or its ligand (PD-L1), or combination (ICI) therapy.Our literature search identified 90 patient cases (our case excluded). Most patients were treated with anti-PD-1 or anti PD L1 as monotherapy (79%) or in combination with CTLA-4 blockade (15%). On average, diabetes mellitus was diagnosed after 4.5 cycles; earlier for combination ICI at 2.7 cycles. Early-onset diabetes mellitus (after 1 or 2 cycles) was observed during all treatment regimens. Diabetic ketoacidosis was present in 71%, while elevated lipase levels were detected in 52% (13/25). Islet autoantibodies were positive in 53% of patients with a predominance of glutamic  decarboxylase antibodies. Susceptible HLA genotypes were present in 65% (mostly DR4). Thyroid dysfunction was the most frequent other endocrine AE at 24% incidence in this patient population.ICI-related diabetes mellitus is a rare but often life-threatening metabolic urgency of which health-care professionals and patients should be aware. Close monitoring of blood glucose and prompt endocrine investigation in case of hyperglycemia is advisable. Predisposing factors such as HLA genotype might explain why some individuals are at risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29590171>PARP1 depletion induces RIG-I-dependent signaling in human cancer cells.</a></h2><p>DNA Damage Response (DDR) and DNA repair pathways are emerging as potent, ubiquitous suppressors of innate  signaling in human cells. Here, we show that human cells surviving depletion of the Single Strand Break (SSB) repair protein PARP1 undergo p21-dependent senescence or    activation in the context of activation of innate  signaling, or viral mimicry. Specifically, we observe induction of a large number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs; including RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TLR3 and STING) and increased nuclear IRF3 staining. Mechanistically, depletion of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) helicase RIG-I or its downstream effector MAVS specifically rescues ISG induction in PARP1-depleted cells, suggesting that the RIG-I/MAVS pathway is required for sustained ISG expression in this context. Experiments with conditioned media or a neutralizing antibody to the α/β-IFN receptor revealed that persistent ISG expression additionally requires an autocrine/paracrine loop. Finally, loss of PARP1 and radiation-induced DNA damage strongly synergize in the induction of p21 and ISGs. Overall, these findings increase our understanding of how PARP1 may suppress deleterious phenotypes associated to aging, inflammation and cancer in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132380>Photothermal therapy mediated by phase-transformation nanoparticles facilitates delivery of anti-PD1 antibody and synergizes with antitumor immunotherapy for melanoma.</a></h2><p>Melanoma remains one of the most challenging malignant tumor related deaths worldwide and alternative approaches to efficiently treat melanoma are eagerly needed. Anti-PD1 antibody (aPD1) immunotherapy is the most significant and impactful therapy for melanoma by   inhibition and T  stimulation to mediate tumor killing. But the clinical remission rate of aPD1 immunotherapy is limited in melanoma. Here we show a potent combination of aPD1 and photothermal therapy (PTT) by effective delivery of a multifunctional phase-transformation nanocarrier to melanoma tumor. We successfully synthesized multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated with aPD1, iron oxide and perfluoropentane (PFP) in lactic-co-glycolic  (PLGA) shell modified with poly ethylene glycol (PEG) and Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) peptides (GOP@aPD1). In vitro, GOP@aPD1 NPs were characterized for particle size and drug-loading efficiency. The NPs were also tested for photothermal property, optical droplet vaporization (ODV) capacity and the ability of aPD1 release profile. In vivo, GOP@aPD1 NPs were systemically administered to melanoma-bearing mice demonstrated no toxicity and accumulation at tumor site. When mediated with PTT, this synergistic treatment achieved enhanced antitumor efficacy, due to combination of the effective aPD1 release and increased CD8+ T  infiltration in tumor site. In conclusion, GOP@aPD1 NPs combined with PTT could potentiate the efficacy of aPD1 not only by tumor-targeted delivery of aPD1 but also by activating the  system in the tumor microenvironment, which is a highly effective approach to treat melanoma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigate specific binding of radiolabeled ipilimumab to CTLA-4 expressed by human non-small  lung cancer cells in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). Ipilimumab was radiolabeled with Cu (t = 12.7 h) through the use of the chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic  (DOTA) to formulate Cu-DOTA-ipilimumab. CTLA-4 expression in three non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC)  lines (A549, H460, and H358) was verified and quantified by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). A receptor binding assay was utilized to monitor the binding and internalization of Cu-DOTA-ipilimumab in the NSCLC  lines. Next, the biodistribution of Cu-DOTA-ipilimumab was mapped by longitudinal PET imaging up to 48 h after injection. Ex vivo biodistribution and histological studies were employed to verify PET results. By in vitro analysis, CTLA-4 was found to be expressed on all three NSCLC  lines with A549 and H358 showing the highest and lowest level of expression, respectively. PET imaging and quantification verified these findings as the tracer accumulated highest in the A549 tumor model (9.80 ± 0.22%ID/g at 48 h after injection; n = 4), followed by H460 and H358 tumors with uptakes of 9.37 ± 0.26%ID/g and 7.43 ± 0.05%ID/g, respectively (n = 4). The specificity of the tracer was verified by injecting excess ipilimumab in A549 tumor-bearing mice, which decreased tracer uptake to 6.90 ± 0.51%ID/g at 48 after injection (n = 4). Ex vivo analysis following the last imaging session also corroborated these findings. Cu-DOTA-ipilimumab showed enhanced and persistent accumulation in CTLA-4-expressing tissues, which will enable researchers further insight into CTLA-4 targeted therapies in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28280600>Structural basis of a novel PD-L1 nanobody for   blockade.</a></h2><p>The use of antibodies to target  , particularly PD-1/PD-L1, has made a profound impact in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we identified KN035, an anti-PD-L1 nanobody that can strongly induce T- responses and inhibit tumor growth. The crystal structures of KN035 complexed with PD-L1 and free PD-L1, solved here at 1.7 and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively, show that KN035 competes with PD-1 (programmed death protein 1) for the same flat surface on PD-L1, mainly through a single surface loop of 21 amino . This loop forms two short helices and develops key hydrophobic and ionic interactions with PD-L1 residues, such as Ile54, Tyr56 and Arg113, which are also involved in PD-1 binding. The detailed mutagenesis study identified the hotspot residues of the PD-L1 surface and provides an explanation for the stronger (~1 000-fold) binding of KN035 to PD-L1 than PD-1 and its lack of binding to PD-L2. Overall, this study reveals how a single immunoglobulin-variable scaffold of KN035 or PD-1 can bind to a flat protein surface through either a single surface loop or beta-sheet strands; and provides a basis for designing new   blockers and generating bi-specific antibodies for combination therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29732161>Rapid-onset diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to nivolumab therapy.</a></h2><p>We report a case of a 67-year-old man with type 2 diabetes presented with diabetic ketoacidosis, two weeks after his first dose of nivolumab therapy for non-small- lung carcinoma.

Until now, anti-PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue sections has been the only validated companion diagnostic test for first-line immunotherapy for advanced and metastatic cancer, notably non-small- lung cancer (NSCLC). However, detection of this biomarker presents limitations that have stimulated the development of other biomarkers and other approaches. Within this context, the use of a liquid biopsy (LB) could provide an important complementary or alternative added value to PD-L1 IHC. In this review, we discuss how LBs have been used in the field of immuno-oncology (I-O) to predict response, relapse or adverse advents for patients undergoing - inhibitor (ICI) therapy (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) and we highlight recent developments. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), -free DNA (cfDNA), proteins and cytokines detected in plasma as well as circulating T-lymphocytes are discussed as potential sources for developing new I-O biomarkers. The quantification of cfDNA as a predictive biomarker, as well as its sequencing for the determination of tumor mutational burden, is already well advanced. Additionally, the quantification of PD-L1 from CTCs, bound on exosomes or free in plasma, as well as the determination of cytokines, are also being actively investigated with promising results having recently been published. Lastly, analysis of T-lymphocytes, especially by analyzing the T- receptor, has recently emerged as a valuable biomarker that might become relevant for the prediction of response to ICIs. While LBs have not yet been implemented in routine I-O clinical practice, recent promising data and rapidly advancing technologies indicate that this approach has the potential to soon personalize the clinical management of cancer patients receiving ICIs.© The Author(s) 2019.

US Food and Drug Administration-approved immunotherapies for cancer treatment (including, but not limited to, sipuleucel-T, ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab) substantially improve overall survival across multiple malignancies. One mechanism of action of these treatments is to induce an  response against antigen-bearing tumor cells; the resultant  death releases secondary (nontargeted) tumor antigens. Secondary antigens prime subsequent  responses (antigen spread). Immunotherapy-induced antigen spread has been shown in clinical studies. For example, in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, sipuleucel-T induced early  responses to the immunizing antigen (PA2024) and/or the target antigen (prostatic  phosphatase). Thereafter, most patients developed increased antibody responses to numerous secondary proteins, several of which are expressed in prostate cancer with functional relevance in cancer. The ipilimumab-induced antibody profile in melanoma patients shows that antigen spread also occurs with   blockade. In contrast to chemotherapy, immunotherapy often does not result in short-term changes in conventional disease progression end points (eg, progression-free survival, tumor size), which may be explained, in part, by the time taken for antigen spread to occur. Thus, -related response criteria need to be identified to better monitor the effectiveness of immunotherapy. As immunotherapy antitumor effects take time to evolve, immunotherapy in patients with less advanced cancer may have greater clinical benefit vs those with more advanced disease. This concept is supported by prostate cancer clinical studies with sipuleucel-T, PSA-TRICOM, and ipilimumab. We discuss antigen spread with cancer immunotherapy and its implications for clinical outcomes.© The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

These cells contribute to the failure of cancer therapies and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite recent advances in the understanding of PMN-MDSC biology, the mechanisms responsible for the pathological activation of neutrophils are not well defined, and this limits the selective targeting of these cells. Here we report that mouse and human PMN-MDSCs exclusively upregulate fatty  transport protein 2 (FATP2). Overexpression of FATP2 in PMN-MDSCs was controlled by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, through the activation of the STAT5 transcription factor. Deletion of FATP2 abrogated the suppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs. The main mechanism of FATP2-mediated suppressive activity involved the uptake of arachidonic  and the synthesis of prostaglandin E. The selective pharmacological inhibition of FATP2 abrogated the activity of PMN-MDSCs and substantially delayed tumour progression. In combination with  inhibitors, FATP2 inhibition blocked tumour progression in mice. Thus, FATP2 mediates the acquisition of immunosuppressive activity by PMN-MDSCs and represents a target to inhibit the functions of PMN-MDSCs selectively and to improve the efficiency of cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29679564>Frequencies and expression levels of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in circulating tumor RNA (ctRNA) in various cancer types.</a></h2><p>Precision medicine and prediction of therapeutic response requires monitoring potential biomarkers before and after treatment. Liquid biopsies provide noninvasive prognostic markers such as circulating tumor DNA and RNA. Circulating tumor RNA (ctRNA) in blood is also used to identify mutations in genes of interest, but additionally, provides information about relative expression levels of important genes. In this study, we analyzed PD-L1 expression in ctRNA isolated from various cancer types. Tumors inhibit antitumor response by modulating the   proteins programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its cognate receptor PD1. The expression of these genes has been implicated in evasion of  response and resistance to targeted therapies.Blood samples were collected from gastric (GC), colorectal (CRC), lung (NSCLC), breast (BC), prostate cancer (PC) patients, and a healthy control group. ctRNA was purified from fractionated plasma, and following reverse transcription, levels of PD-L1 expression were analyzed using qPCR.PD-L1 expression was detected in the plasma ctRNA of all cancer types at varying frequencies but no PD-L1 mRNA was detected in cancer-free individuals. The frequencies of PD-L1 expression were significantly different among the various cancer types but the median relative PD-L1 expression values were not significantly different. In 12 cases where plasma and tumor tissue were available from the same patients, there was a high degree of concordance between expression of PD-L1 protein in tumor tissues and PD-L1 gene expression in plasma, and both methods were equally predictive of response to nivolumab.PD-L1 mRNA can be detected and quantitated in ctRNA of cancer patients. These results pave the way for further studies aimed at determining whether monitoring the levels of PD-L1 mRNA in blood can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from the conventional treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Mice with Treg -restricted Neuropilin-1 deficiency show tumor resistance while maintaining peripheral  homeostasis, thereby providing a controlled system to interrogate the impact of intratumoral Treg cells on the TME. Using this and other genetic models, we showed that Treg cells shaped the transcriptional landscape across multiple tumor-infiltrating   types. Treg cells suppressed CD8 T  secretion of interferon-γ (IFNγ), which would otherwise block the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-mediated fatty  synthesis in immunosuppressive (M2-like) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Thus, Treg cells indirectly but selectively sustained M2-like TAM metabolic fitness, mitochondrial integrity, and survival. SREBP1 inhibition augmented the efficacy of   blockade, suggesting that targeting Treg cells or their modulation of lipid metabolism in M2-like TAMs could improve cancer immunotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Cancer cells are capable of evading clearance by macrophages through the overexpression of anti-phagocytic surface proteins called 'don't eat me' signals-including CD47, programmed  death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the beta-2 microglobulin subunit of the major histocompatibility class I complex (B2M). Monoclonal antibodies that antagonize the interaction of 'don't eat me' signals with their macrophage-expressed receptors have demonstrated therapeutic potential in several cancers. However, variability in the magnitude and durability of the response to these agents has suggested the presence of additional, as yet unknown 'don't eat me' signals. Here we show that CD24 can be the dominant innate   in ovarian cancer and breast cancer, and is a promising target for cancer immunotherapy. We demonstrate a role for tumour-expressed CD24 in promoting  evasion through its interaction with the inhibitory receptor sialic--binding Ig-like lectin 10 (Siglec-10), which is expressed by tumour-associated macrophages. We find that many tumours overexpress CD24 and that tumour-associated macrophages express high levels of Siglec-10. Genetic ablation of either CD24 or Siglec-10, as well as blockade of the CD24-Siglec-10 interaction using monoclonal antibodies, robustly augment the phagocytosis of all CD24-expressing human tumours that we tested. Genetic ablation and therapeutic blockade of CD24 resulted in a macrophage-dependent reduction of tumour growth in vivo and an increase in survival time. These data reveal CD24 as a highly expressed, anti-phagocytic signal in several cancers and demonstrate the therapeutic potential for CD24 blockade in cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384998>Inhibition of PD1:PD-L1 interaction by an E. coli-derived optimized PD1 variant.</a></h2><p>- receptors are a set of signal transduction proteins that can stimulate or inhibit specific anti-tumor responses. It is well established that cancer cells interact with different   to shut down T- response, thereby enabling cancer proliferation. Given the importance of   receptors, a structure-function analysis of these systems is imperative. However, recombinant expression and purification of these membrane originated proteins is still a challenge. Therefore, many attempts are being made to improve their expression and solubility while preserving their biological relevance. For this purpose, we designed an E. coli-based optimization system that enables the acquisition of mutations that increases protein solubility and affinity towards its native ligand, while maintaining biological activity. Here we focused on the well-characterized extracellular domain of the 'programmed  death protein 1' (PD1), an   receptor known to inhibit T- proliferation by interacting with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The simple ELISA-based screening system shown here enabled the identification of high-affinity, highly soluble, functional variants derived from the extracellular domain of human PD1. The system was based on the expression of a GST-tagged variants library in E. coli, which enabled the selection of improved PD1 variants after a single optimization round. Within only two screening rounds, the most active variant showed a 5-fold higher affinity and 2.4-fold enhanced cellular activity as compared to the wild type protein. This scheme can be translated toward other types of challenging receptors toward development of research tools or alternative therapeutics.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, only a minority of patients with pulmonary metastatic disease respond to treatment with  inhibitors. As an alternate approach, we have tested the ability of systemically administered 1V270, a toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist conjugated to a phospholipid, to inhibit lung metastases in two variant murine 4T1 breast cancer models, as well as in B16 melanoma, and Lewis lung carcinoma models. In the 4T1 breast cancer models, 1V270 therapy inhibited lung metastases if given up to a week after primary tumor initiation. The treatment protocol was facilitated by the minimal toxic effects exerted by the phospholipid TLR7 agonist compared with the unconjugated agonist. 1V270 exhibited a wide therapeutic window and minimal off-target receptor binding. The 1V270 therapy inhibited colonization by tumor cells in the lungs in an NK  dependent manner. Additional experiments revealed that single administration of 1V270 led to tumor-specific CD8 -dependent adaptive  responses that suppressed late-stage metastatic tumor growth in the lungs. T  receptor (TCR) repertoire analyses showed that 1V270 therapy induced oligoclonal T cells in the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes. Different animals displayed commonly shared TCR clones following 1V270 therapy. Intranasal administration of 1V270 also suppressed lung metastasis and induced tumor-specific adaptive  responses. These results indicate that systemic 1V270 therapy can induce tumor-specific cytotoxic T  responses to pulmonary metastatic cancers and that TCR repertoire analyses can be used to monitor, and to predict, the response to therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30693544>An Efficient Combination Immunotherapy for Primary Liver Cancer by Harmonized Activation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity in Mice.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy with  inhibitors for liver cancer, while active in many clinical trials worldwide, may have uncertain outcomes due to the unique immunotolerant microenvironment of the liver. In previous experiments, we unexpectedly identified a robust liver tumor-preventive effect of a synthetic double-stranded RNA, polyinosinic-polycytidylic  (polyIC), in mice. Herein we further demonstrate that polyIC given at the precancer stage effectively prevented liver tumorigenesis by activating natural killer cells, macrophages, and some T- subsets; no inhibitory effect was observed on tumor progression if injected after tumor initiation. Nevertheless, polyIC administration potently induced programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in liver sinusoid endothelial cells, which prompted us to test a combined treatment of polyIC and PD-L1 antibody (Ab). Although injecting PD-L1 Ab alone did not show any therapeutic effect, injection of polyIC sensitized the hepatic response to PD-L1 blockade. Combination of polyIC and PD-L1 Ab resulted in sustained accumulation of active cluster of differentiation 8 cytotoxic T cells and robust liver tumor suppression and conferred a survival advantage in mice. These preclinical data in animal models suggest that, despite the low efficacy of PD-L1/PD-1 blockade alone, careful design of mechanism-based combinatorial immunotherapeutic protocols may shift the paradigm in liver cancer treatment by coordinating maximal activation of multiple innate and adaptive  functions. Conclusion: We provide proof of principle for the development of an efficient prevention strategy of liver tumorigenesis and a powerful combination immunotherapy for primary liver cancer.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28678778>An immunogenic personal neoantigen vaccine for patients with melanoma.</a></h2><p>Effective anti-tumour immunity in humans has been associated with the presence of T cells directed at cancer neoantigens, a class of HLA-bound peptides that arise from tumour-specific mutations. They are highly immunogenic because they are not present in normal tissues and hence bypass central thymic tolerance. Although neoantigens were long-envisioned as optimal targets for an anti-tumour  response, their systematic discovery and evaluation only became feasible with the recent availability of massively parallel sequencing for detection of all coding mutations within tumours, and of machine learning approaches to reliably predict those mutated peptides with high-affinity binding of autologous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. We hypothesized that vaccination with neoantigens can both expand pre-existing neoantigen-specific T- populations and induce a broader repertoire of new T- specificities in cancer patients, tipping the intra-tumoural balance in favour of enhanced tumour control. Here we demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of a vaccine that targets up to 20 predicted personal tumour neoantigens. Vaccine-induced polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells targeted 58 (60%) and 15 (16%) of the 97 unique neoantigens used across patients, respectively. These T cells discriminated mutated from wild-type antigens, and in some cases directly recognized autologous tumour. Of six vaccinated patients, four had no recurrence at 25 months after vaccination, while two with recurrent disease were subsequently treated with anti-PD-1 (anti-programmed  death-1) therapy and experienced complete tumour regression, with expansion of the repertoire of neoantigen-specific T cells.

Through the depletion of Trp and the generation of kynurenines, IDO1 represents a key regulator of the  responses involved in physiologic homeostasis as well as in neoplastic and autoimmune pathologies. The IDO1 enzyme has been described as an important   to be targeted by catalytic inhibitors in the treatment of cancer. In contrast, a defective expression/activity of the enzyme has been demonstrated in autoimmune diseases. Beside its catalytic activity, the IDO1 protein is endowed with an additional function associated with the presence of two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which, once phosphorylated, bind SHP phosphatases and mediate a long-term immunoregulatory activity of IDO1. Herein, we report the screening of a focused library of molecules bearing a propanol core by a protocol combining microscale thermophoresis (MST) analysis and a cellular assay. As a result, the combined screening identified a 2-propanolol analogue, VIS351, as the first potent activator of the ITIM-mediated function of the IDO1 enzyme. VIS351 displayed a good dissociation constant (Kd = 1.90 μM) for IDO1 and a moderate cellular inhibitor activity (IC = 11.463 μM), although it did not show any catalytic inhibition of the recombinant IDO1 enzyme. Because we previously demonstrated that the enzymatic and non-enzymatic (i.e., ITIM-mediated) functions of IDO1 reside in different conformations of the protein, we hypothesized that in the cellular system VIS351 may shift the dynamic conformational balance towards the ITIM-favoring folding of IDO1, resulting in the activation of the signaling rather than catalytic activity of IDO1. We demonstrated that VIS351 activated the ITIM-mediated signaling of IDO1 also in mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells, conferring those cells an immunosuppressive phenotype detectable in vivo. Thus the manuscript describes for the first time a small molecule as a positive modulator of IDO1 signaling function, paving the basis for an innovative approach to develop first-in-class drugs acting on the IDO1 target.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Most patients have a rapid resolution of symptoms and do not require additional immunosuppressants. Many patients, however, require prolonged corticosteroid courses to maintain control of toxicity. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is the prodrug of mycophenolic ; which in turn directly inhibits activated T and B lymphocytes. MMF, in addition to corticosteroids, may enable reduction of corticosteroids without precipitating resurgence of colitis. Metastatic melanoma patients between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017 with combination IO-induced colitis were managed with a novel treatment algorithm: upfront oral enteric-coated MMF alongside high-dose corticosteroids. Outcome measures included incidence of colitis flare, time to grade 1 colitis, time to patient-reported normal bowel habit and overall cumulative corticosteroid exposure. Thirteen patients developed high-grade combination IO-induced colitis; 11 were managed with the combination of high-dose corticosteroid and MMF. Median patient age was 59 (range: 28-73) years. Four (36%) developed flare of colitis; flares occurred at a median of 11 (interquartile range: 4.5-16.75) days. All colitis flares responded fully to infliximab (5 mg/kg). The remaining seven patients did not develop colitis flare during corticosteroid wean. All patients were successfully weaned from corticosteroids and none had a resurgence of colitis at 8 weeks following discontinuation of MMF. Concomitant enteric-coated MMF alongside high-dose corticosteroids may hasten the improvement of high-grade colitis to normal bowel habit and reduce the incidence of colitis flare.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186714>Integration of Next-generation Sequencing and   Inhibitors in Targeted Symptom Control and Palliative Care in Solid Tumor Malignancies: A Multidisciplinary Clinician Perspective.</a></h2><p>The molecular characterization of solid tumor malignancies with respect to tumorgenesis, risk stratification, and prognostication of chemotherapeutic side effects is multi-faceted. Characterizing these mechanisms requires a detailed understanding of cytogenetics and pharmacology. In addition to the standard palliative care interventions that address issues such as fatigue, neuropathy, performance status, depression, nutrition, cachexia, anxiety, and medical ethics, we must also delve into individual chemotherapy side effects. Comprehending these symptoms is more complex with the advent of broader targeted therapies. With the advent and initiation of Foundation Medicine (FMI) testing, we have been able to tailor regimens to the individual genetics of the patient. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a bioinformatic analysis used in order to create a targeted effort to understand the complex genetics of a vast array of malignancies. Through the process known as high-throughput sequencing we, as clinicians, can obtain more real-time genetic data and incorporate the information into our reasoning process. The process involves a broad manner in which deoxyribonucleic  (DNA) sequence data is obtained including genome sequencing and resequencing, protein-DNA or proteinomics, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing, ribonucleic  (RNA) sequencing, and epigenomic analysis.

We have developed a new approach that accurately quantifies PD-L1 status and identifies multiple mutations by using a single bronchoscopy specimen. A novel molecular marker was identified to detect the presence of malignant cells in radial endobronchial ultrasound bronchial brushings from NSCLC (n = 15) and benign (n = 13) nodules by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). The MMP9:TIMP3 transcript ratio was significantly increased in NSCLC and using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis accurately discriminated malignant and benign bronchoscopy specimens (area under the curve = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93-1; P < 0.0001). Utilizing the same specimens, PD-L1 expression and multiple oncogenic mutations were detected by RT-qPCR and next-generation sequencing. A second archive of snap-frozen squamous  carcinoma (n = 40) and control (n = 20) biopsies with matching formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded slides were used to compare PD-L1 status by immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR. The biopsy cohort confirmed that the MMP-9:TIMP3 ratio was predictive of malignancy and demonstrated that PD-L1 transcript expression was concordant with PD-L1 tumor  membrane staining in NSCLC (Spearman r = 0.636, P < 0.0001).

Using RTqPCR, we have previously identified a gene expression panel that detected presence of malignant cells (MMP9:TIMP3 ratio) and quantified PD-L1 transcript levels in small biopsy specimens. However, RTqPCR has diagnostic limitations as it does not generate absolute copy number and is not readily multiplexed. To address this, we have developed a multiplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay.Biopsies obtained from NSCLC patients (n = 48 adenocarcinoma and n = 40 squamous  carcinoma) and control lung biopsy specimens (n = 20) were analysed. Absolute MMP9, TIMP3 and PD-L1 transcript copy numbers were determined within a single assay by multiplex ddPCR using Taqman primers and the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System.Using our optimised triplex ddPCR assay, the MMP9:TIMP3 ratio was significantly elevated in NSCLC biopsies and using a cut-off of >0.028, was 99% (95% CI; 80.5-94.5) sensitive and 80% specific for identifying malignant biopsies. The PD-L1:TIMP3 ratio significantly associated with PD-L1 tumour  immunohistochemistry staining (r = 0.539, p < 0.0001) and was significantly higher in biopsies with >50% PD-L1 tumour  staining (p < 0.0001). In summary, a major advantage of our workflow is that it can accurately quantify PD-L1 tumour levels and provide sufficient nucleic  for screening additional targetable mutations such as EGFR, ALK and ROS1 from a single small biopsy, thereby potentially avoiding the need for re-biopsy.

ED downregulated MYC, E2F, and G2M   genes. Accordingly, entinostat sensitized the cells to doxorubicin-induced growth arrest at G2. ED induced interferon genes, which correlated with breast tumors containing a higher proportion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. ED also increased the expression of   agonists and cancer testis antigens. Analysis of TNBC xenografts showed that EAD enhanced the inflammation score in nude mice. Among the genes differentially regulated between the EAD and ED groups, an all-trans retinoic  (ATRA)-regulated gene, DHRS3, was induced in EAD-treated xenografts. DHRS3 was expressed at lower levels in human TNBC metastases compared to normal breast or primary tumors. High expression of ED-induced growth arrest and inflammatory genes was associated with better prognosis in TNBC patients.Entinostat potentiated doxorubicin-mediated  death and the combination induced inflammatory signatures.

T cells are a powerful model for the investigation of such modulatory effects, as common precursor cells may differentiate either to helper CD4 T cells or cytotoxic CD8 cells, which elicit distinct functionalities upon TCR-stimulation. Human primary CD4 and CD8 T cells were purified from three individual donors and activated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Associated proteome alterations were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry using a label-free shotgun approach. Metabolic activation was indicated by upregulation of enzymes related to glycolysis, NADH production, fatty  synthesis, and uptake as well as amino  and iron uptake. Besides various inflammatory effector molecules, the mitochondrial proteins CLUH, TFAM, and TOMM34 were found specifically induced in CD4 T cells. Investigation of overrepresented conserved transcription binding sites by the oPOSSUM software suggested interferon type I inducer IRF1 to cause many of the observed proteome alterations in CD4 T cells. RT qPCR demonstrated the specific induction of  in CD4 T cells only. While the interferon regulatory factor IRF4 was found induced in both T  subtypes at protein and mRNA level, IRF9 and the type I interferon-induced proteins IFIT1, IFIT3, and MX1 were only found induced in CD4 T cells. As oxidative stress enhances mitochondrial DNA-dependent type I interferon responses, the present data suggested that mitochondrial activities regulate those  type-specific signaling pathways. Indeed, we detected mitochondrial superoxide formation predominantly in CD4 T cells  FACS analysis with MitoSOX™ and confirmed this observation by live  imaging with confocal microscopy.

We report that tissue-specific expression of the human long noncoding RNA LINK-A in mouse mammary glands initiates metastatic mammary gland tumors, which phenotypically resemble human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). LINK-A expression facilitated crosstalk between phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate and inhibitory G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways, attenuating protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM71. Consequently, LINK-A expression enhanced K48-polyubiquitination-mediated degradation of the antigen peptide-loading complex (PLC) and intrinsic tumor suppressors Rb and p53. Treatment with LINK-A locked nucleic  or GPCR antagonists stabilized the PLC components, Rb and p53, and sensitized mammary gland tumors to   blockers. Patients with programmed ccll death protein-1(PD-1) blockade-resistant TNBC exhibited elevated LINK-A levels and downregulated PLC components.

T cells have distinct energetic and anabolic needs when nascently activated, actively proliferating, in naïveté, or in a resting, memory state. As a consequence, bioenergetics are key for T cells to mount adequate  responses in health and disease. Solid tumors are particularly hostile metabolic environments, characterized by low glucose concentration, hypoxia, and low pH. These metabolic conditions in the tumor are known to hinder antitumor  responses of T cells by limiting nutrient availability and energetic efficiency. In such immunosuppressive environments, artificial modulation of glycolysis, mitochondrial respiratory capabilities, and fatty  β-oxidation are known to enhance antitumor performance. Reportedly, costimulatory molecules, such as CD28 and CD137, are important regulators of metabolic routes in T cells. In this sense, different costimulatory signals and cytokines induce diverse metabolic changes that critically involve mitochondrial mass and function. For instance, the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) encompassing costimulatory domains, agonist antibodies to costimulatory receptors, and  inhibitors depends on the associated metabolic events in  cells.

We used biodegradable nanoparticles as delivery vehicles for local, slow and sustained release of doxorubicin, two  adjuvants and one chemokine for the treatment of resistant solid tumors.  Bio-compatible poly(lactic-co-glycolic )-PEG nanoparticles were synthesized in an oil/water emulsion, using a solvent evaporation-extraction method.

After physicochemical and  characterization the nanoparticles therapeutic efficacy were carried-out on established, highly aggressive and treatment resistant TC-1 lung carcinoma and MC-38 colon adenocarcinoma models .  The yielded nanoparticles average size was 180 nm and -14 mV surface charge. The combined treatment with all compounds was significantly superior than separate compounds and the compounds nanoparticle encapsulation was required for effective tumor control . The mechanistic studies confirmed strong induction of circulating cancer specific T cells upon combined treatment in blood. Analysis of the tumor microenvironment revealed a significant increase of infiltrating leukocytes upon treatment.  The multi-drug loaded nanoparticles mediated delivery of chemoimmunotherapy exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy gain on two treatment resistant cancer models and is a potent candidate strategy to improve cancer therapy of solid tumors resistant to first-line therapies.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627442>Verification of 5-Aminolevurinic Radiodynamic Therapy Using a Murine Melanoma Brain Metastasis Model.</a></h2><p>Melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer with a propensity for brain metastases. These can be treated by radiotherapy, but the radiation-resistant nature of melanoma makes the prognosis for melanoma patients with brain metastases poor. Previously, we demonstrated that treatment of mice with subcutaneous melanoma with 5-aminolevurinic  (5-ALA) and X-rays in combination, ("radiodynamic therapy (RDT)"), instead of with 5-ALA and laser beams ("photodynamic therapy"), improved tumor suppression in vivo. Here, using the B16-Luc melanoma brain metastasis model, we demonstrate that 5-ALA RDT effectively treats brain metastasis. We also studied how 5-ALA RDT damages cells in vitro using a B16 melanoma culture.  culture preincubated with 5-ALA alone increased intracellular photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. On X-ray irradiation, the cells enhanced their ∙OH radical generation, which subsequently induced γH2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks in their nuclei, but decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. After two days, the   was arrested. When 5-ALA RDT was applied to the brain melanoma metastasis model in vivo, suppression of tumor growth was indicated. Therapeutic efficacy in melanoma treatment has recently been improved by molecular targeted drugs and   inhibitors. Treatment with these drugs is now expected to be combined with 5-ALA RDT to further improve therapeutic efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30534022>The current status of immunotherapy for cervical cancer.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy has been proven effective in several tumours, hence diverse   inhibitors are currently licensed for the treatment of melanoma, kidney cancer, lung cancer and most recently, tumours with microsatellite instability. There is much enthusiasm for investigating this approach in gynaecological cancers and the possibility that immunotherapy might become part of the therapeutic landscape for gynaecological malignancies. Cervical cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer in women worldwide and represents 7.9% of all female cancers with a higher burden of the disease and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Cervical cancer is largely a preventable disease, since the introduction of screening tests, the recognition of the human papillomavirus (HPV) as an etiological agent, and the subsequent development of primary prophylaxis against high risk HPV subtypes. Treatment for relapsed/advanced disease has improved over the last 5 years, since the introduction of antiangiogenic therapy. However, despite advances, the median overall survival for advanced cervical cancer is 16.8 months and the 5-year overall survival for all stages is 68%. There is a need to improve outcomes and immunotherapy could offer this possibility. Clinical trials aim to understand the best timing for immunotherapy, either in the adjuvant setting or recurrent disease and whether immunotherapy, alone or in combination with other agents, improves outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302192>A Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist ARNAX for therapeutic immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Vaccine immunotherapy consisting of tumor antigens combined with an -enhancing adjuvant fosters cytotoxic T  (CTL) proliferation. Clinically, polyI:C has been used as an adjuvant to enhance cancer vaccine protocols. However, according to its long history, polyI:C promotes inflammation that causes cytokine toxicity. Although  inhibitor immunotherapy has improved the prognoses of patients with progressive cancer, over 75% of patients continue to experience resistance to antibody (Ab) against anti-programmed  death-protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand, PD-L1 therapy. In most cases, patients suffer from adverse events resulting from inflammation during anti-PD-1/L1 Ab therapy, which is a serious obstacle to patients' quality of life. We have studied the functional properties of double-stranded (ds)RNA and polyI:C, and developed a nucleic  adjuvant that barely induces a significant increase in the level of serum inflammatory cytokines in mouse models. This adjuvant, termed ARNAX, consists of DNA-capped dsRNA that specifies the endosomal target for Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in dendritic cells (DCs). We expect that this adjuvant is safe for administration in elderly patients with cancer receiving immunotherapy. Here, we summarize the properties of ARNAX for immunotherapy in mice. We suggest that DC-priming is essential to induce anti-tumor immunity; neither exogenous inflammation nor the administration of tumor antigens is always a prerequisite for DC-mediated CTL proliferation. If our mouse data can be extrapolated to humans, ARNAX and the liberated endogenous tumor antigens may facilitate effect of current therapies on patients with therapy-resistant tumors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 agent, has gained approval in the second-line setting in the USA. Epigenetic drugs have -mediated antitumor effects that may improve the activity of immunotherapy agents. Our aim was to study the therapeutic efficacy of  inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies) in combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) Belinostat. In a subcutaneous Hepa129 murine HCC model, we demonstrated that Belinostat improves the antitumor activity of anti-CTLA-4 but not of anti-PD-1 therapy. This effect correlated with enhanced IFN-γ production by antitumor T-cells and a decrease in regulatory T-cells. Moreover, the combination induced early upregulation of PD-L1 on tumor antigen-presenting cells and late expression of PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating effector T-cells, suggesting the suitability of PD-1 blockade. Indeed, Belinostat combined with the simultaneous blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 led to complete tumor rejection. These results provide a rationale for testing Belinostat in combination with  inhibitors to enhance their therapeutic activity in patients with HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29263257>Dual Ligand Insertion in gB and gD of Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Viruses for Retargeting to a Producer Vero  Line and to Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>Oncolytic viruses gain cancer specificity in several ways. Like the majority of viruses, they grow better in cancer cells that are defective in mounting the host response to viruses. Often, they are attenuated by deletion or mutation of virulence genes that counteract the host response or are naturally occurring oncolytic mutants. In contrast, retargeted viruses are not attenuated or deleted; their cancer specificity rests on a modified, specific tropism for cancer receptors. For herpes simplex virus (HSV)-based oncolytics, the detargeting-retargeting strategies employed so far were based on genetic modifications of gD. Recently, we showed that even gH or gB can serve as retargeting tools. To enable the growth of retargeted HSVs in cells that can be used for clinical-grade virus production, a double-retargeting strategy has been developed. Here we show that several sites in the N terminus of gB are suitable to harbor the 20-amino- (aa)-long GCN4 peptide, which readdresses HSV tropism to Vero cells expressing the artificial GCN4 receptor and thus enables virus cultivation in the producer noncancer Vero-GCN4R  line. The gB modifications can be combined with a minimal detargeting modification in gD, consisting in the deletion of two residues, aa 30 and 38, and replacement of aa 38 with the scFv to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), for retargeting to the cancer receptor. The panel of recombinants was analyzed comparatively in terms of virus growth, -to- spread, cytotoxicity, and  antitumor efficacy to define the best double-retargeting strategy. There is increasing interest in oncolytic viruses, following FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of HSV Oncovex, and, mainly, because they greatly boost the  response to the tumor and can be combined with immunotherapeutic agents, particularly  inhibitors. A strategy to gain cancer specificity and avoid virus attenuation is to retarget the virus tropism to cancer-specific receptors of choice. Cultivation of fully retargeted viruses is challenging, since they require cells that express the cancer receptor. We devised a strategy for their cultivation in producer noncancer Vero  derivatives. Here, we developed a double-retargeting strategy, based on insertion of one ligand in gB for retargeting to a Vero  derivative and of anti-HER2 ligand in gD for cancer retargeting. These modifications were combined with a minimally destructive detargeting strategy. This study and its companion paper explain the clinical-grade cultivation of retargeted oncolytic HSVs and promote their translation to the clinic.Copyright © 2018 Petrovic et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28371397>Delayed pseudoprogression of lung adenocarcinoma accompanied with interstitial lung disease during chemotherapy after nivolumab treatment.</a></h2><p>A 62-year-old Japanese female with primary lung adenocarcinoma received seven cycles of nivolumab as an eighth line of chemotherapy until she presented with hemoptysis. After transcatheter arterial embolization therapy, she received subsequent chemotherapy with paclitaxel and S-1. Four weeks later, a chest computed tomography examination revealed infiltrative shadows mainly in the right lung field, in addition to enlargement of the lung metastasis in the right middle lung lobe. Bronchofiberscopic examination revealed infiltration of lymphocytes without any malignant cells in the right segment 1 of the lung, which suggested interstitial lung disease. Corticosteroid therapy not only improved the infiltrative shadows but also reduced the lung metastasis. Even after the infiltrative shadows improved, the lung metastasis reduced further.

Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a clinically validated predictive biomarker of response to -inhibitor therapy in a limited number of clinical settings but is poorly predictive in most. With emerging evidence that multiple pathways and - proteins may coordinately contribute to the adaptive  resistance, the identification and quantitation of multiple  markers in tumor tissue could help identify the controlling pathways in a given patient, guide the selection of optimal therapy, and monitor response to treatment. We developed and validated a sensitive and robust immuno-liquid chromatography-parallel reaction monitoring assay to simultaneously quantify the expression levels of six  markers (CD8A, CD4, LAG3, PD1, PD-L1, and PD-L2) using as little as 1-2 mg of fresh frozen tissue. The lower limit of quantitation ranged from 0.07 ng/mg protein for PD1 to 1.0 ng/mg protein for CD4. The intrabatch accuracy was within -16.6% to 15.0% for all proteins at all concentrations, and the variation ranged from 0.8% to 14.7%, while interbatch accuracy was within -6.3% to 8.6%, and the variation ranged from 1.3% to 12.8%. The validated assay was then applied to quantify all six biomarkers in different tissues and was confirmed to have sufficient sensitivity (0.07-1.00 ng/mg protein) and reproducibility (variation ranged from 4.3 to 12.0%). In an analysis of 26 cervical tumors, CD8A and CD4 were detected in all tumors, followed by PD-L1 in 85%, LAG-3 in 65%, PD1 in 50%, and PD-L2 in 35%. The strongest correlations were observed between CD8A and CD4 ( r = 0.88) and CD8A and LAG-3 ( r = 0.86). PD1 was not significantly correlated with any of the other proteins tested. This method can be applied to survey the  signatures across tumor types and tailored to incorporate additional markers as needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28325288>Retroviral Replicating Vector Delivery of miR-PDL1 Inhibits   PDL1 and Enhances  Responses In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Tumor cells express a number of immunosuppressive molecules that can suppress anti-tumor  responses. Efficient delivery of small interfering RNAs to treat a wide range of diseases including cancers remains a challenge. Retroviral replicating vectors (RRV) can be used to stably and selectively introduce genetic material into cancer cells. Here, we designed RRV to express shRNA (RRV-shPDL1) or microRNA30-derived shRNA (RRV-miRPDL1) using Pol II or Pol III promoters to downregulate PDL1 in human cancer cells. We also designed RRV expressing cytosine deaminase (yCD2) and miRPDL1 for potential combinatorial therapy. Among various configurations tested, we showed that RRV-miRPDL1 vectors with Pol II or Pol III promoter replicated efficiently and exhibited sustained downregulation of PDL1 protein expression by more than 75% in human cancer  lines with high expression of PDL1. Immunologic effects of RRV-miRPDL1 were assessed by a trans-suppression lymphocyte assay. In vitro data showed downregulation of PDL1 tumor cells restored activation of CD8 T cells and bio-equivalency compared to anti-PDL1 antibody treatment. These results suggest RRV-miRPDL1 may be an alternative therapeutic approach to enhance anti-tumor immunity by overcoming PDL1-induced  suppression from within cancer cells and this approach may also be applicable to other cancer targets.Copyright © 2016 Tocagen Inc.

Availability of arginine, a semi-essential amino , is critical for lymphocyte proliferation and function. Levels of arginine are regulated by the enzymes arginase 1,2 and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). However, the role of arginase activity in lung tumor maintenance has not been investigated in clinically relevant orthotopic tumor models.RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of sorted  populations from mouse lung adenocarcinomas derived from immunocompetent genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM)s was performed. To complement mouse studies, a patient tissue microarray consisting of 150 lung adenocarcinomas, 103 squamous tumors, and 54 matched normal tissue were stained for arginase, CD3, and CD66b by multiplex immunohistochemistry. Efficacy of a novel arginase inhibitor compound 9 in reversing arginase mediated T  suppression was determined in splenocyte ex vivo assays. Additionally, the anti-tumor activity of this compound was determined in vitro and in an autochthonous immunocompetent Kras GEMM of lung adenocarcinoma model.Analysis of RNA-seq of sorted myeloid cells suggested that arginase expression is elevated in myeloid cells in the tumor as compared to the normal lung tissue. Accordingly, in the patient samples arginase 1 expression was mainly localized in the granulocytic myeloid cells and significantly elevated in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous tumors as compared to the controls. Our ex vivo analysis demonstrated that myeloid derived suppressor  (MDSC)s cause T  suppression by arginine depletion, and suppression of arginase activity by a novel ARG1/2 inhibitor, compound 9, led to restoration of T  function by increasing arginine. Treatment of Kras GEMM of lung cancer model with compound 9 led to a significant tumor regression associated with increased T  numbers and function, while it had no activity across several murine and human non-small  (NSCLC) lung cancer lines in vitro.We show that arginase expression is elevated in mouse and patient lung tumors. In a KRAS GEMM arginase inhibition diminished growth of established tumors. Our data suggest arginase as an immunomodulatory target that should further be investigated in lung tumors with high arginase activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29998219>Novel tumour antigens and the development of optimal vaccine design.</a></h2><p>The interplay between tumours and the  system has long been known to involve complex interactions between tumour cells,  cells and the tumour microenvironment. The progress of  inhibitors in the clinic in the last decade has highlighted again the role of the  system in the fight against cancer. Numerous efforts have been undertaken to develop ways of stimulating the cellular  response to eradicate tumours. These interventions include the identification of appropriate tumour antigens as targets for therapy. In this review, we summarize progress in selection of target tumour antigen. Targeting self antigens has the problem of thymic deletion of high-affinity T- responses leaving a diminished repertoire of low-affinity T cells that fail to kill tumour cells. Thymic regulation appears to be less stringent for differentiation of cancer-testis antigens, as many tumour rejection antigens fall into this category. More recently, targeting neo-epitopes or post-translational modifications such as a phosphorylation or stress-induced citrullination has shown great promise in preclinical studies. Of particular interest is that the responses can be mediated by both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Previous vaccines have targeted CD8 T- responses but more recently, the central role of CD4 T cells in orchestrating inflammation within tumours and also differentiating into potent killer cells has been recognized. The design of vaccines to induce such  responses is discussed herein. Liposomally encoded ribonucleic  (RNA), targeted deoxyribonucleic  (DNA) or long peptides linked to toll-like receptor (TLR) adjuvants are the most promising new vaccine approaches. These exciting new approaches suggest that the 'Holy Grail' of a simple nontoxic cancer vaccine may be on the horizon. A major hurdle in tumour therapy is also to overcome the suppressive tumour environment. We address current progress in combination therapies and suggest that these are likely to show the most promise for the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30339819>Generation of cancer vaccine immunogens derived from major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules using variable epitope libraries.</a></h2><p>Although various   inhibitors (ICIs), used for the treatment of advanced cancer, showed remarkably durable tumor regression in a subset of patients, there are important limitations in a large group of non-responders, and the generation of novel immunogens capable of inducing protective cellular  responses is a priority in cancer immunotherapy field. During the last decades, several types of vaccine immunogens have been used in numerous preclinical studies and clinical trials. However, although immunity to tumor Ags can be elicited by most vaccines tested, their clinical efficacy remains modest. Recently, we have developed an innovative vaccine concept, called Variable Epitope Libraries (VELs), with the purpose to exploit the high antigenic variability of many important pathogens and tumor cells as starting points for the construction of a new class of vaccine immunogens capable of inducing the largest possible repertoire of both B and T cells. In the present study, we decided to generate VEL immunogens derived from both classical and non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The MHC molecules, responsible for antigen presentation and subsequent activation of T lymphocytes, undergo multiple modifications that directly affect their proper function, resulting in  escape of tumor cells. Two large VELs derived from multi-epitope region of H2-Kd and Qa-2 sequences (46 and 34 amino  long, respectively), along with their wild type counterparts have been generated as synthetic peptides and tested in an aggressive 4T1 mouse model of breast cancer. Significant inhibition of tumor growth and the reduction of metastatic lesions in the lungs of immunized mice were observed. This study demonstrated for the first time the successful application of VELs carrying combinatorial libraries of epitope variants derived from MHC class I molecules as novel vaccine immunogens.Copyright © 2018 European Federation of Immunological Societies.

These drugs are known to have specific -mediated adverse events. We describe a case of severe nephrotic syndrome secondary to treatment with nivolumab in a patient with renal  carcinoma.A 62-year-old man was treated with nivolumab for papillary renal  carcinoma type 2 for 8 weeks when he was admitted to the hospital with a severe nephrotic syndrome and acute kidney injury.

Clinical-grade virus production cannot rely on cancer cells. Recently, we developed a double-retargeting strategy whereby gH carries the GCN4 peptide for retargeting to the noncancer producer Vero-GCN4R  line and gD carries the scFv to HER2 for cancer retargeting. Here, we engineered double-retargeted recombinants, which carry both the GCN4 peptide and the scFv to HER2 in gD. Novel, more-advantageous detargeting strategies were devised so as to optimize the cultivation of the double-retargeted recombinants. Nectin1 detargeting was achieved by deletion of amino  (aa) 35 to 39, 214 to 223, or 219 to 223 and replacement of the deleted sequences with one of the two ligands. The last two deletions were not attempted before. All recombinants exhibited the double retargeting to HER2 and to the Vero-GCN4R cells, as well as detargeting from the natural receptors HVEM and nectin1. Of note, some recombinants grew to higher yields than others. The best-performing recombinants carried a gD deletion as small as 5 amino  and grew to titers similar to those exhibited by the singly retargeted R-LM113 and by the nonretargeted R-LM5. This study shows that double retargeting through insertion of two ligands in gD is feasible and, when combined with appropriate detargeting modifications, can result in recombinants highly effective  and  There is increasing interest in oncolytic viruses following the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of the oncolytic HSV Oncovex and, mainly, because they greatly boost the  response to the tumor and can be combined with immunotherapeutic agents, particularly   inhibitors. A strategy to gain high cancer specificity and avoid virus attenuation is to retarget the virus tropism to cancer-specific receptors of choice. However, cultivation of retargeted oncolytics in cells expressing the cancer receptor may not be approvable by regulatory agencies. We devised a strategy for their cultivation in noncancer cells. Here, we describe a double-retargeting strategy, based on the simultaneous insertion of two ligands in gD, one for retargeting to a producer, universal Vero  derivative and one for retargeting to the HER2 cancer receptor. These insertions were combined with novel, minimally disadvantageous detargeting modifications.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 3a (eIF3a) plays a critical role in affecting tumor  proliferation and differentiation. However, whether eIF3a is implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia cells differentiation remains unclear. Our results demonstrated that eIF3a could be suppressed by ATPR in K562 cells. The results also confirmed that ATPR could arrest   in G0/G1 phase and induced differentiation. Moreover, over-expression of eIF3a promoted not only protein expression of c-myc and cyclin D1, but also prevented the expression of p-Raf-1, p-ERK and the myeloid differentiation markers CD11b and CD14 and had an influence on inducing the morphologic mature. However, silencing eIF3a expression by small interfering RNA could have an adverse effect on K562 cells. In addition, PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor) could block  differentiation of CML cells and contributed to the expression of c-myc and cyclin D1.

Vaccination against neoepitopes derived from patient tumor material can generate tumor-specific T  immunity, which could reinforce the efficacy of  inhibitor therapies such as anti-PD-1 treatment. DNA vaccination is a versatile platform that allows the inclusion of multiple neoantigen-coding sequences in a single formulation and therefore represents an ideal platform for neoantigen vaccination. We developed an anti-tumor vaccine based on a synthetic DNA vector designed to contain multiple cancer-specific epitopes in tandem. The DNA vector encoded a fusion gene consisting of three neoepitopes derived from the mouse colorectal tumor MC38 and their natural flanking sequences as 40 amino  stretches. In addition, we incorporated as reporter epitopes the helper and CTL epitope sequences of ovalbumin. The poly-neoantigen DNA vaccine elicited T  responses to all three neoantigens and induced functional CD8 and CD4 T  responses to the reporter antigen ovalbumin after intradermal injection in mice. The DNA vaccine was effective in preventing outgrowth of B16 melanoma expressing ovalbumin in a prophylactic setting. Moreover, the combination of therapeutic DNA vaccination and anti-PD-1 treatment was synergistic in controlling MC38 tumor growth whereas individual treatments did not succeed.

Featuring a rapid proliferation rate and exacerbated glycolysis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) creates a highly hypoxic microenvironment with excessive production of lactic and carbonic . These metabolic conditions promote disease aggressiveness and cancer-related immunosuppression. The pH regulatory molecules work as a bridge between tumor cells and their surrounding milieu. Herein, we show that the pH regulatory molecules CAIX, CAXII and V-ATPase are overexpressed in the HCC microenvironment and that interfering with their pathways exerts antitumor activity. Importantly, the V-ATPase complex was expressed by M2-like tumor-associated macrophages. Blocking  V-ATPase activity established a less -suppressive tumor microenvironment and reversed the mesenchymal features of HCC. Thus, targeting the unique cross-talk between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment played by pH regulatory molecules holds promise as a strategy to control HCC progression and to reduce the immunosuppressive pressure mediated by the hypoxic/acidic metabolism, particularly considering the potential combination of this strategy with emerging  -based immunotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040208>Reprogramming the microenvironment with tumor-selective angiotensin blockers enhances cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can either suppress or support T lymphocyte activity, suggesting that CAFs may be reprogrammable to an immunosupportive state. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) convert myofibroblast CAFs to a quiescent state, but whether ARBs can reprogram CAFs to promote T lymphocyte activity and enhance immunotherapy is unknown. Moreover, ARB doses are limited by systemic adverse effects such as hypotension due to the importance of angiotensin signaling outside tumors. To enhance the efficacy and specificity of ARBs in cancer with the goal of revealing their effects on antitumor immunity, we developed ARB nanoconjugates that preferentially accumulate and act in tumors. We created a diverse library of hundreds of -degradable polymers and chemically linked ARBs to the polymer most sensitive to tumor pH. These tumor microenvironment-activated ARBs (TMA-ARBs) remain intact and inactive in circulation while achieving high concentrations in tumors, wherein they break down to active ARBs. This tumor-preferential activity enhances the CAF-reprogramming effects of ARBs while eliminating blood pressure-lowering effects. Notably, TMA-ARBs alleviate immunosuppression and improve T lymphocyte activity, enabling dramatically improved responses to - blockers in mice with primary as well as metastatic breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31183900>In Situ Modification of the Tumor  Surface with Immunomodulating Nanoparticles for Effective Suppression of Tumor Growth in Mice.</a></h2><p>Current cancer immunotherapies including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based therapies and   inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical success, but always suffer from immunotoxicity and autoimmune disease. Recently, nanomaterial-based immunotherapies are developed to precisely control in vivo  activation in tumor tissues for reducing -related adverse events. However, little consideration has been put on the spatial modulation of interactions between  cells and cancer cells to optimize the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. Herein, a rational design of immunomodulating nanoparticles is demonstrated that can in situ modify the tumor  surface with natural killer  (NK )-activating signals to achieve in situ activation of tumor-infiltrating NK cells, as well as direction of their antitumor immunity toward tumor cells. Using these immunomodulating nanoparticles, the remarkable inhibition of tumor growth is observed in mice without noticeable side effects. This study provides an accurate immunomodulation strategy that achieves safe and effective antitumor immunity through in situ NK  activation in tumors. Further development by constructing interactions with various  cells can potentially make this nanotechnology become a general platform for the design of advanced immunotherapies for cancer treatments.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Beyond developing immunostimulatory regimens like dendritic -based vaccines, - blockers, and adoptive T- transfer, investigators are beginning to focus on the immunobiology of dying cancer cells and its relevance for the success of anticancer immunotherapies. It is currently accepted that cancer cells may die in response to anti-cancer therapies through regulated  death programs, which may either repress or increase their immunogenic potential. In particular, the induction of immunogenic cancer  death (ICD), which is hallmarked by the emission of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs); molecules analogous to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) acting as danger signals/alarmins, is of great relevance in cancer therapy. These ICD-associated danger signals favor immunomodulatory responses that lead to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs)-directed T- immunity, which paves way for the removal of residual, treatment-resistant cancer cells. It is also emerging that cancer cells succumbing to ICD can orchestrate "altered-self mimicry" i.e. mimicry of pathogen defense responses, on the levels of nucleic  and/or chemokines (resulting in type I interferon/IFN responses or pathogen response-like neutrophil activity). In this review, we exhaustively describe the main molecular, immunological, preclinical, and clinical aspects of immunosuppressive  death or ICD (with respect to apoptosis, necrosis and necroptosis). We also provide an extensive historical background of these fields, with special attention to the self/non-self and danger models, which have shaped the field of  death immunology.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Neoantigens are highly immunogenic as they are not expressed in normal tissues. They can activate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to generate  response and have the potential to become new targets of tumor immunotherapy. The development of bioinformatics technology has accelerated the identification of neoantigens. The combination of different algorithms to identify and predict the affinity of neoantigens to major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) or the immunogenicity of neoantigens is mainly based on the whole-exome sequencing technology. Tumor vaccines targeting neoantigens mainly include nucleic , dendritic  (DC)-based, tumor , and synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccines. The combination with   inhibition therapy or radiotherapy and chemotherapy might achieve better therapeutic effects. Currently, several clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of these vaccines. Further development of sequencing technologies and bioinformatics algorithms, as well as an improvement in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumor development, will expand the application of neoantigen vaccines in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30303856>Advances in the treatment of gastric cancer.</a></h2><p>To review the recent literature regarding treatment of gastric cancer.Addition of postoperative radiation therapy to perioperative chemotherapy offers no survival benefit. Fluoropyrimidines, in particular 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), are the backbone for gastric cancer chemotherapy. S-1, an oral prodrug of 5-FU, has become the mainstay for gastric cancer chemotherapy in Japan. In a Japanese adjuvant chemotherapy trial, addition of docetaxel to standard S-1 chemotherapy improved disease-free survival; this regimen will become their new standard for adjuvant therapy. Microsatellite instability (MSI) high status is emerging as a favorable prognostic marker in resected gastric cancer and may indicate a group of patients who do not gain additional benefit from treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy. In metastatic gastric cancer, the addition of ramucirumab, an antivascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-targeted antibody, to first-line chemotherapy did not improve survival over chemotherapy alone. Trifluridine/tipiracil treatment in chemotherapy-refractory gastric cancer improved survival compared to placebo and will emerge as a late-line therapy option. Phase II and III trials indicate activity for the   inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab in chemotherapy-refractory gastric cancer and have led to US regulatory approval for pembrolizumab in chemotherapy-refractory programmed death ligand 1-positive or MSI-high gastric cancer, and approval in Japan for nivolumab in chemotherapy-refractory gastric cancer. However, a phase III trial in advanced gastric cancer failed to show a survival benefit for pembrolizumab over conventional paclitaxel. The poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor, olaparib, added to second-line paclitaxel in advanced gastric cancer failed to improve overall survival compared with paclitaxel alone.Perioperative or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy without radiation therapy remains the standard of care in gastric cancer. Addition of docetaxel to adjuvant S-1 will likely emerge as a new care standard. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab improve survival and now are treatment options in chemotherapy-refractory gastric cancer, especially for programmed death ligand 1-positive or MSI-high cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29890018>High-affinity PD-1 molecules deliver improved interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2.</a></h2><p>The inhibitory  molecule programmed death (PD)-1 plays a vital role in maintaining  homeostasis upon binding to its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Several recent studies have demonstrated that soluble PD-1 (sPD-1) can block the interaction between membrane PD-1 and PD-L1 to enhance the antitumor capability of T cells. However, the affinity of natural sPD-1 binding to PD-L1 is too low to permit therapeutic applications. Here, a PD-1 variant with approximately 3000-fold and 70-fold affinity increase to bind PD-L1 and PD-L2, respectively, was generated through directed molecular evolution and phage display technology. Structural analysis showed that mutations at amino  positions 124 and 132 of PD-1 played major roles in enhancing the affinity of PD-1 binding to its ligands. The high-affinity PD-1 mutant could compete with the binding of antibodies specific to PD-L1 or PD-L2 on cancer cells or dendritic cells, and it could enhance the proliferation and IFN-γ release of activated lymphocytes. These features potentially qualify the high-affinity PD-1 variant as a unique candidate for the development of a new class of PD-1 - blockade therapeutics.© 2018 The Authors.

The major clinical therapies for cancer include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted molecular therapy. MicroRNAs and long noncoding RNAs function through various mechanisms in these approaches, and the mechanisms involve direct targeting of  , cooperation with exosomes in the tumor microenvironment, and alteration of drug resistance through regulation of different signaling pathways.

Although well-conducted systematic studies on drug-related psoriasis are mostly lacking, traditionally strong associations have been documented for beta-blockers, lithium, antimalarial drugs such as (hydroxy)chloroquine, interferons, imiquimod, and terbinafine. More recently, new associations have been reported for monoclonal antibody- and small-molecule-based targeted therapies used for oncological and immunological indications, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists and anti-programmed  death protein 1   inhibitors. Recognizing potential drug-related psoriasis is of clinical relevance to allow an optimal management of psoriasis. However, in clinical practice, identifying medication-related exacerbations and induction of psoriasis can be challenging. The clinical and histopathological features of drug-provoked psoriasis may differ little from that of "classical" nondrug-related forms of psoriasis. In addition, the latency period between start of the medication and onset of psoriasis can be significantly long for some drugs. Assessment of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale could be used as a practical tool to better differentiate drug-related psoriasis. The first step in the management of drug-related psoriasis is cessation and replacement of the offending drug when deemed clinically possible. However, the induced psoriasis skin lesions may persist after treatment withdrawal. Additional skin-directed treatment options for drug-related psoriasis follows the conventional psoriasis treatment guidelines and includes topical steroids and vitamin D analogs, ultraviolet phototherapy, systemic treatments, such as acitretin, methotrexate, and fumaric  esters, and biological treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261684>Aristolochic  and Immunotherapy for Urothelial Carcinoma: Directions for unmet Needs.</a></h2><p>Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) and upper tracts (UTUC) used to share management with similar principles.

Different from the variety of environmental factors relating to UCB, UTUC is best known for its close relationship with exposure to aristolochic  (AA). AA is believed to cause its carcinogenicity through forming DNA adducts of deoxyadenosine-aristolactam, as well as A:T → T:A transversions in the  tumor suppressor gene. Since recent findings suggested that cancers with higher somatic mutations are associated with better treatment responses upon   blockade, UTUC and AA-related biomarkers reasonably serve as good candidates, as well as a potential prognostic predictor for the flourishing immunotherapy.

Broilers have high requirement for Met, so they are at high risk of Met deficiency. The aims of the present research is to study the effects of Met deficiency on the histomorphological changes, antioxidant functions, apoptosis and   in the cecum tonsil of broilers. A batch of 120 one-day-old Cobb broilers in total are divided into two groups and fed on a Met deficiency diet or a control diet for six weeks, followed by analysis using the methods of experimental pathology, biochemical method, immunohistochemical method, ELISA, FCM, Tunel assay, and qRT-PCR. Results showed that the cecal tonsils were impaired, and the SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activity, the ability to suppression on the hydroxy radicals, and the content of GSH reduced in Met deficiency group comparing to the control group. In contrast, the MDA content is higher in Met deficiency group. As measured by immunohistochemical method, ELISA, Tunel, FCM and qRT-PCR, increased proportion of apoptotic cells, abnormal content or expression of apoptotic proteins, as well as   arrest were observed. In conclusion, dietary Met deficiency imposes a severe impact on the cecal tonsils, mainly in the forms of histological injury,   arrest, oxidative stress, and increased cellular apoptosis. The oxidative stress leads to cellular apoptosis and then induces the injury of the cecum tonsils. The local intestinal mucosal  system would finally be injured by the oxidative stress and apoptosis in the intestine.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, therapeutic success in patients remains variable underscoring the need for novel combinatorial approaches.Here we established a vaccination strategy that combines engagement of the nucleic -sensing pattern recognition receptor RIG-I, antigen and CTLA-4 blockade. We used in vitro transcribed 5'-triphosphorylated RNA (3pRNA) to therapeutically target the RIG-I pathway. We performed in vitro functional analysis in bone-marrow derived dendritic cells and investigated RIG-I-enhanced vaccines in different murine melanoma models.We found that protein vaccination together with RIG-I ligation via 3pRNA strongly synergizes with CTLA-4 blockade to induce expansion and activation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells that translates into potent antitumor immunity. RIG-I-induced cross-priming of cytotoxic T cells as well as antitumor immunity were dependent on the host adapter protein MAVS and type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling and were mediated by dendritic cells.Overall, our data demonstrate the potency of a novel combinatorial vaccination strategy combining RIG-I-driven immunization with CTLA-4 blockade to prevent and treat experimental melanoma.

Included in that spectrum is the rare side effect of autoimmune diabetes mellitus. Despite a few case reports illustrating the incidence of autoimmune diabetes associated with immunotherapy, there has not been much mentioned about exacerbation or acceleration of hyperglycemia in non-autoimmune settings leading to de novo diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.We report the case of a 42 year old man with metastatic melanoma and no prior history of diabetes mellitus, who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after 3 cycles of combination  inhibitor therapy using nivolumab and ipilimumab. New onset diabetes mellitus was diagnosed on the basis of elevated hemoglobin A1c, in the absence of prior personal or family history.

To understand this unexpected result, the presence of infiltrating  cells was investigated in 124 pre-therapeutic biopsies of patients enrolled in the trial. The percentage of CD68/CD163 tumor-infiltrating macrophages (TAMs), CD8 lymphocytes, osteoclasts, and the PD1/PDL-1  were assessed by immunohistochemistry. M1/M2 macrophage polarization was characterized by pSTAT1/CMAF staining. The expression of these biomarkers was correlated with clinical outcome. No statistical correlations were found with response to chemotherapy. High CD163 levels (>50% of cells per core; 43.8% of patients) were associated with CMAF nuclear expression and significantly correlated with better overall survival ( = 0.0025) and longer metastasis progression-free survival (MPFS,  = 0.0315) independently of metastatic status ( = 0.002). Only a trend was observed for patients with high CD68-positive cells ( = 0.0582). CD8 staining was positive in >50% of cases with a median staining of 1%. Lower CD8 levels were associated with metastatic disease at diagnosis and the presence of CD8-positive cells significantly correlated with improved overall survival in zoledronate-treated patients ( = 0.0415). PD1/PDL-1 staining was negative in >80% of cases and was not correlated with outcome. Finally, CD163-positive TAMs and CD8 positive cells are crucial prognostic biomarkers in OS, whereas PD1/PDL-1  plays a minor role.

We report a 52-year-old woman with advanced-stage non-small  lung cancer who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at 24 weeks after atezolizumab initiation. She initially received oral antidiabetic medication from primary care hospital and experienced recurrent DKA 3 days later. Her plasma glucose on the day that she had recurrent DKA was 332 mg/dL (18.4 mmol/L), A1c was 7.9% (63 mmol/mol), fasting C-peptide was <0.03 nmol/L (0.1 ng/ml), fasting insulin level was <1 μIU/ml, anti-glutamic  decarboxylase 65 (GADA) was 7.2 U/ml (normal, >5 U/ml), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II typing was DR3-DQ2/DR14-DQ5.

C57BL/6 mice were primed with  Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and boosted repeatedly with a combination of  fusion proteins Mtb10.4-HspX (MH) plus ESAT6-Ag85B-MPT64 -Mtb8.4-Rv2626c (LT70) or MH plus ESAT6 and CFP10 with adjuvant of N, N'-dimethyl-N, N'-dioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) plus polyinosinic-polycytidylic  (Poly I:C). Following persistent antigen stimulation, the mice were treated with IL-2 and the therapeutic effects were analyzed. The results showed that compared with the mice that received transient antigen stimulation (boost twice), persistent antigen stimulation (boost more than 10 times) resulted in decrease of antigen specific IFN-γ and IL-2 production, reduction of memory CD8 T cells, over-expression of   programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1), and impaired the protective immunity against bacterial challenge. Treating the T  functionally exhausted mice with IL-2 restored antigen-specific T  responses and protective efficacy.

For treatments using  inhibitors to be successful, a high mutational load and responses to neoepitopes are thought to be essential. There is limited intratumoural infiltration of  cells in glioblastoma and these tumours contain only 30-50 non-synonymous mutations. Exploitation of the full repertoire of tumour antigens-that is, both unmutated antigens and neoepitopes-may offer more effective immunotherapies, especially for tumours with a low mutational load. Here, in the phase I trial GAPVAC-101 of the Glioma Actively Personalized Vaccine Consortium (GAPVAC), we integrated highly individualized vaccinations with both types of tumour antigens into standard care to optimally exploit the limited target space for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Fifteen patients with glioblastomas positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01 or HLA-A*24:02 were treated with a vaccine (APVAC1) derived from a premanufactured library of unmutated antigens followed by treatment with APVAC2, which preferentially targeted neoepitopes. Personalization was based on mutations and analyses of the transcriptomes and immunopeptidomes of the individual tumours. The GAPVAC approach was feasible and vaccines that had poly-ICLC (polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic -poly-L-lysine carboxymethylcellulose) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor as adjuvants displayed favourable safety and strong immunogenicity.

Currently, major evidence suggests that imaging parameters especially derived from amino  PET, perfusion-/diffusion-weighted MRI, or MR spectroscopy may provide valuable additional information for the differentiation of treatment-induced changes from brain metastases recurrence and the evaluation of treatment response.© The Author(s) 2019.

This was achieved by formulating both nucleic -based immunotherapeutics into a lipid-coated calcium phosphate (LCP) nanoparticle (NP) as a carrier to address the delivery challenge. The PEGylated lipid NPs were functionalized with mannose as the targeting ligand to facilitate the preferential uptake by the dendritic cells (DCs) in the lymph nodes after subcutaneous administration. The calcium phosphate core allowed -mediated dissolution in the endo-lysosomal compartment, which prompted rapid release of cargoes after cellular internalization of NP. LCP mRNA vaccine encoding TRP2 elicited a robust antigen-specific cytotoxic T  response and a humoral  response in a C57BL/6 mouse model of B16F10 melanoma. The  responses efficaciously inhibited the melanoma growth. Moreover, co-delivery of PD-L1 siRNA and mRNA vaccine resulted in the downregulation of PD-L1 in the DCs that presented tumor antigens, significantly prompting T  activation and proliferation. The enhanced T  response had a profound inhibitory effect on tumor growth and metastasis.

In contrast, OTUD1 mutants impair its suppressive effects on IRF3 via attenuating the OTUD1 deubiquinase activity or its association with IRF3. Moreover, we found FOXO3 signaling is required for OTUD1 induction upon antigenic stimulation. Our data demonstrate that OTUD1 is involved in maintaining  homeostasis and loss-of-function mutations of OTUD1 enhance the  response and are associated with autoimmunity.Copyright © 2018.

Targeting the inhibitory co-receptors programmed  death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) has successfully eradicated tumors but induced -related adverse events in humans and mice. The beneficial and adverse effects of targeting these co-receptors highlight their importance in cancer immunity and also autoimmunity. Although the therapeutic potencies of other inhibitory co-receptors are under extensive investigation, their inhibitory mechanisms and their functional differences are not well understood. Here we analyzed the inhibitory mechanisms of lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), another inhibitory co-receptor, by using an  T  activation system and a high-affinity anti-LAG-3 antibody that strongly interferes with the binding of LAG-3 to its ligand. We found that the expression level of LAG-3 strongly correlates with the inhibitory function of LAG-3, suggesting that LAG-3 functions as a rheostat rather than as a breaker of T  activation. By evaluating the inhibitory capacities of various LAG-3 variants relative to their expression levels, we found that LAG-3 transduces two independent inhibitory signals through an FL motif in the membrane-proximal region and the C-terminal E repeat. These motifs have not been reported previously for inhibitory co-receptors, suggesting that LAG-3 inhibits T  activation through a nonredundant inhibitory mechanisms along with the other inhibitory co-receptors. Our findings provide a rationale for combinatorial targeting of LAG-3 and the other inhibitory co-receptors to improve cancer immunotherapy.© 2019 Maeda et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31146119>Drug promiscuity: Exploring the polypharmacology potential of 1, 3, 6-trisubstituted 1, 4-diazepane-7-ones as an inhibitor of the 'god father' of  .</a></h2><p>High production cost, instability, low tumor penetration are some of the shortcomings that have characterized and undermined the use of antibodies as a target for Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Design and discovery of small molecule inhibitors have therefore become a sine qua non in targeting  proteins implicated in  disorders. In this study, we utilized a drug repositioning approach to explore the characteristic feature of unrelated proteins to have similar binding sites and the promiscuity of drugs to repurpose an existing drug to target CTLA-4. CTLA-4 and Kallikrein-7 were found to have similar binding sites, we therefore used 1, 3, 6-trisubstituted 1, 4-diazepane-7-ones (TDSO) which is an inhibitor of Kallikrein-7 as our lead compound. High throughput screening using TDSO as a lead compound resulted in 9 hits with ZINC04515726 and ZINC08985213 having the highest binding score. We went ahead to investigate the interaction of these compounds with CTLA-4 by conducting a molecular dynamic simulation. Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) estimations revealed that TDSO had the highest binding energy value of -28.51Kcal/mol, with ZINC04515726 and ZINC08985213 having -23.76Kcal/mol and -21.03Kcal/mol respectively. The per-residue decomposition highlighted Tyr24, Ala25, Gly28, Ala30, Tyr53 and Asn72 as having significantly high electrostatic energy contributions and the main contributing residues to the binding of TDSO, ZINC04515726 and ZINC08985213 to Cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTLA-4.

Grade 3-4 diarrhea/colitis is the most frequent irAE requiring treatment discontinuation. Predicting high-risk diarrhea/colitis patients may facilitate early intervention, limit irAE severity, and extend treatment duration. No biomarkers currently predict for anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy related severe diarrhea.Whole-blood was collected pre-treatment and 30 days post-treatment initiation from patients with stage III or IV unresectable melanoma who received 15 mg/kg tremelimumab at 90 day intervals in two clinical trials. The discovery dataset was a phase II study that enrolled 150 patients between December 2005 and November 2006. The validation dataset was a phase III study that enrolled 210 patients between March 2006 and July 2007. RT-PCR was performed for 169 genes associated with inflammation, immunity, CTLA-4 pathway and melanoma. Gene expression was correlated with grade 0-1 versus grade 2-4 diarrhea/colitis development.Pre-treatment blood obtained from the discovery dataset (N = 150) revealed no gene predictive of diarrhea/colitis development (p < 0.05). A 16-gene signature (CARD12, CCL3, CCR3, CXCL1, F5, FAM210B, GADD45A, IL18bp, IL2RA, IL5, IL8, MMP9, PTGS2, SOCS3, TLR9 and UBE2C) was identified from 30 days post-tremelimumab initiation blood that discriminated patients developing grade 0-1 from grade 2-4 diarrhea/colitis. The 16-gene signature demonstrated an AUC of 0.814 (95% CI 0.743 to 0.873, p < 0.0001), sensitivity 42.9%, specificity 99.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) 90.0%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 91.4%. In the validation dataset (N = 210), the 16-gene signature discriminated patients developing grade 0-1 from grade 2-4 diarrhea/colitis with an AUC 0.785 (95% CI 0.723 to 0.838, p < 0.0001), sensitivity 57.1%, specificity 84.4%, PPV 57.1% and NPV 84.4%.This study identifies a whole-blood mRNA signature predictive of a clinically relevant irAE in patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade. We hypothesize that immune system modulation induced by immune checkpoint blockade results in peripheral blood gene expression changes that are detectable prior to clinical onset of severe diarrhea. Assessment of peripheral blood gene expression changes in patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, or combination anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, is warranted to provide early on-treatment mechanistic insights and identify clinically relevant predictive biomarkers.Clinicaltrials.gov ,  , registered 22 November 2005.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31439937>A global view of hepatocellular carcinoma: trends, risk, prevention and management.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Risk factors for HCC include chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C, alcohol addiction, metabolic liver disease (particularly nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) and exposure to dietary toxins such as aflatoxins and aristolochic . All these risk factors are potentially preventable, highlighting the considerable potential of risk prevention for decreasing the global burden of HCC. HCC surveillance and early detection increase the chance of potentially curative treatment; however, HCC surveillance is substantially underutilized, even in countries with sufficient medical resources. Early-stage HCC can be treated curatively by local ablation, surgical resection or liver transplantation. Treatment selection depends on tumour characteristics, the severity of underlying liver dysfunction, age, other medical comorbidities, and available medical resources and local expertise. Catheter-based locoregional treatment is used in patients with intermediate-stage cancer. Kinase and   inhibitors have been shown to be effective treatment options in patients with advanced-stage HCC. Together, rational deployment of prevention, attainment of global goals for viral hepatitis eradication, and improvements in HCC surveillance and therapy hold promise for achieving a substantial reduction in the worldwide HCC burden within the next few decades.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28912094>Selection of PD1/PD-L1 X-Aptamers.</a></h2><p>Specific, chemically modified aptamers (X-Aptamers) were identified against two   proteins, recombinant Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) and Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1).

One tumor-related mechanism limiting the efficacy of immunotherapies in melanoma is the recruitment and expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Therefore, targeting MDSCs in combination with immunotherapies is an attractive strategy to improve response rates and effectiveness.We tested this strategy by designing a randomized phase II clinical trial treating advanced melanoma patients with either Ipilimumab monotherapy or Ipilimumab plus all-trans retinoic  (ATRA). Clinicaltrails.gov identifier (). The frequency of circulating MDSCs and the activation of CD8(+) T cells was measured by flow cytometry. Expression of immunosuppressive genes was measured with quantitative real time-PCR. T  suppressive functions were measured by mixed lymphocyte reaction.Here we show that in vitro treatment with ATRA decreases immunosuppressive function of MDSCs in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Additionally, ATRA reduces the expression of immunosuppressive genes including PD-L1, IL-10, and indoleamine 2,3‑dioxygenase by MDSCs. Furthermore, the addition of ATRA to standard of care Ipilimumab therapy appears safe, as ATRA did not increase the frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Finally, ATRA significantly decreased the frequency of circulating MDSCs compared to Ipilimumab treatment alone in advanced-stage melanoma patients.These results illustrate the importance of MDSCs in immunotherapy resistance and provide evidence that targeting MDSCs in cancer patients may augment immunotherapeutic approaches.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

It plays an important role as a rheostat of the  response. Focus on this receptor as a potential therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy has been underscored after the success of other - blockade strategies in clinical trials. LAG3 showcases the interest in the field of autoimmunity as several studies show that LAG3-targeting antibodies can also be used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this work we describe the identification of a high-affinity LAG3 aptamer by High Throughput Sequencing SELEX in combination with a study of potential conserved binding modes according to sequence conservation by using 2D-structure prediction and 3D-RNA modeling using Rosetta. The aptamer with the highest accumulation of these conserved sequence motifs displays the highest affinity to LAG3 recombinant soluble proteins and binds to LAG3-expressing lymphocytes. The aptamer described herein has the potential to be used as a therapeutic agent, as it enhances the threshold of T- activation. Nonetheless, in future applications, it could also be engineered for treatment of autoimmune diseases by target depletion of LAG3-effector T lymphocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30004823>Refractory Neutropenia Secondary to Dual   Inhibitors That Required Second-Line Immunosuppression.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28330784>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor inhibitors in the treatment of renal  carcinomas.</a></h2><p>One Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is lost in most renal  carcinomas while the nondeleted allele exhibits hypermethylation-induced inactivation or inactivating somatic mutations. As a result of these genetic modifications, there is an increased production of VEGF-A and pro-angiogenic growth factors in this disorder. The important role of angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of renal  carcinomas and other tumors has focused the attention of investigators on the biology of VEGFs and VEGFR1-3 and to the development of inhibitors of the intricate and multifaceted angiogenic pathways. VEGFR1-3 contain an extracellular segment with seven immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane segment, a juxtamembrane segment, a protein kinase domain with an insert of about 70 amino  residues, and a C-terminal tail. VEGF-A stimulates the activation of preformed VEGFR2 dimers by the auto-phosphorylation of activation segment tyrosines followed by the phosphorylation of additional protein-tyrosines that recruit phosphotyrosine binding proteins thereby leading to signalling by the ERK1/2, AKT, Src, and p38 MAP kinase pathways. VEGFR1 modulates the activity of VEGFR2, which is the chief pathway in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. VEGFR3 and its ligands (VEGF-C and VEGF-D) are involved primarily in lymphangiogenesis. Small molecule VEGFR1/2/3 inhibitors including axitinib, cabozantinib, lenvatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib are approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal  carcinomas. Most of these agents are type II inhibitors of VEGFR2 and inhibit the so-called DFG-Asp inactive enzyme conformation. These drugs are steady-state competitive inhibitors with respect to ATP and like ATP they form hydrogen bonds with the hinge residues that connect the small and large protein kinase lobes. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF-A, is also approved for the treatment of renal  carcinomas. Resistance to these agents invariably occurs within one year of treatment and clinical studies are underway to determine the optimal sequence of treatment with these anti-angiogenic agents. The nivolumab   inhibitor is also approved for the second-line treatment of renal  carcinomas. Owing to the resistance of renal  carcinomas to cytotoxic drugs and radiation therapy, the development of these agents has greatly improved the therapeutic options in the treatment of these malignancies.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We observed that tumors treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies develop resistance through the upregulation of CD38, which is induced by all-trans retinoic  and IFNβ in the tumor microenvironment.  and  studies demonstrate that CD38 inhibits CD8 T- function via adenosine receptor signaling and that CD38 or adenosine receptor blockade are effective strategies to overcome the resistance. Large data sets of human tumors reveal expression of CD38 in a subset of tumors with high levels of basal or treatment-induced T- infiltration, where   therapies are thought to be most effective. These findings provide a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to   therapy and an opportunity to expand their efficacy in cancer treatment. CD38 is a major mechanism of acquired resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, causing CD8 T- suppression. Coinhibition of CD38 and PD-L1 improves antitumor  response.

Here, using a melanoma model, we investigated the antitumor potential of combining ultrasound (US) with poly(lactic-co-glycolic ) (PLGA) microspheres loaded with doxorubicin (DOX). The aim was to achieve synergistic tumoricidal activity through direct and indirect US-mediated damage of tumor cells combined with sustained and potentially controllable release (when combined with US) of DOX from microspheres. An in vitro release assay demonstrated an ability of US to affect the release kinetics of DOX from DOX-loaded PLGA microspheres by inducing a 12% increase in the rate of release. In vitro viability assays demonstrated that combining US with DOX-loaded PLGA microspheres resulted in synergistic tumor  (B16-F10 melanoma cells) killing. Melanoma-bearing mice were treated intratumorally with DOX (8 µg)-loaded microspheres and subjected to US treatment at the tumor site. This treatment could significantly extend survival (mean survival (MS) = 22.1 days) compared to untreated mice (MS = 10.4 days) and most other treatments, such as blank microspheres plus US (MS = 11.5 days) and DOX (8 µg)-loaded microspheres alone (MS = 13 days). The findings that   blockade did not significantly extend survival of mice treated with DOX (8 µg)-loaded microspheres plus US, and that tumor-free ("cured") mice were not protected from subsequent tumor rechallenge suggests minimal involvement of the adaptive  response in the observed antitumor activity. Nevertheless, the synergistic increase in survival of melanoma-challenged mice treated with the combination of US and DOX-loaded microspheres implicates such a treatment methodology as a promising additional tool for combatting otherwise currently incurable cancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, the nature of the neo-antigens driving those beneficial responses remains unclear. Here, we show that APOBEC-related mutagenesis - a mechanism at the crossroads between anti-viral immunity and endogenous nucleic  editing - increases neo-peptide hydrophobicity (a feature of immunogenicity), as demonstrated by  computation and in the TCGA pan-cancer cohort, where APOBEC-related mutagenesis was also strongly associated with  marker expression. Moreover, APOBEC-related mutagenesis correlated with immunotherapy response in a cohort of 99 patients with diverse cancers, and this correlation was independent of the tumor mutation burden (TMB). Combining APOBEC-related mutagenesis estimate and TMB resulted in greater predictive ability than either parameter alone.

Advances in our collective biological understanding of MDS in the last decade, however, have made it possible to hope that effective therapeutics can be designed to improve MDS-associated cytopenias and patients' quality of life, and perhaps even delay clonal progression and extend survival. Classes of MDS-associated mutations and disordered biological pathways targeted by developmental therapeutics include the following: aberrant messenger RNA splicing, neomorphic enzymes in the citric   with oncogenic activity, overactivated tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases, epigenetic and chromatin remodeling alterations, abnormal telomere dynamics, and failed protection of DNA integrity. At present, treatments for MDS are usually administered as sequential monotherapy, but there is a trend toward clinical trials of combination therapies-in which new agents are added to a DNA hypomethylating agent backbone-for both upfront treatment and the treatment of relapsed/refractory disease. Agents in clinical trials for subsets of MDS include luspatercept, antibodies targeting CD33, isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors, deacetylase inhibitors, venetoclax, and immunotherapies designed to overcome   inhibition.

PD-L1 is a co-inhibitory molecule whose expression on the surface of tumor cells is associated with worse prognosis in many tumors. Here we describe a splice variant (secPD-L1) that does not splice into the transmembrane domain, but instead produces a secreted form of PD-L1 that has a unique 18 amino  tail containing a cysteine that allows it to homodimerize and more effectively inhibit lymphocyte function than monomeric soluble PD-L1. We show that recombinant secPD-L1 can dimerize and inhibit T- proliferation and IFN-gamma production in vitro. The secPD-L1 variant is expressed by malignant cells in vitro that also express high levels of full-length PD-L1. Transcriptomic analysis of gene expression across The Cancer Genome Atlas found the strongest association of secPD-L1 with full-length PD-L1, but also with subsets of immunologic genes, such as in myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Moreover, the splice variant is also expressed in normal tissues and within normal peripheral blood cells it is preferentially expressed in activated myeloid cells. This is the first report of a form of secreted PD-L1 that homodimerizes and is functionally active. SecPD-L1 may function as a paracrine negative  regulator within the tumor, since secPD-L1 does not require a -to- interaction to mediate its inhibitory effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28337200>Metabolic Hallmarks of Tumor and  Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells play an important role in eliminating malignant tumor cells and the number and activity of tumor-infiltrating T cells represent a good marker for tumor prognosis. Based on these findings, immunotherapy, e.g.,  blockade, has received considerable attention during the last couple of years. However, for the majority of patients,  control of their tumors is gray theory as malignant cells use effective mechanisms to outsmart the  system. Increasing evidence suggests that changes in tumor metabolism not only ensure an effective energy supply and generation of building blocks for tumor growth but also contribute to inhibition of the antitumor response. Immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment is often based on the mutual metabolic requirements of  cells and tumor cells. Cytotoxic T and NK  activation leads to an increased demand for glucose and amino , a well-known feature shown by tumor cells. These close metabolic interdependencies result in metabolic competition, limiting the proliferation, and effector functions of tumor-specific  cells. Moreover, not only nutrient restriction but also tumor-driven shifts in metabolite abundance and accumulation of metabolic waste products (e.g., lactate) lead to local immunosuppression, thereby facilitating tumor progression and metastasis. In this review, we describe the metabolic interplay between  cells and tumor cells and discuss tumor  metabolism as a target structure for cancer therapy. Metabolic (re)education of tumor cells is not only an approach to kill tumor cells directly but could overcome metabolic immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and thereby facilitate immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29061103>Integration of nano drug-delivery system with cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>  therapy represents a new, revolutionary type of cancer therapy, but emerging evidence indicates that only a minority of patients will benefit from it. The issue of how to improve and widen the clinical response is a pivotal issue, and combining other types of therapy with   inhibitors is currently under development. A nanotechnology-based drug-delivery system (nano DDS) could be an important contribution to the development of an effective combination therapy. In this document, we review recent findings in the field of tumor immunology, which provide a strategy for an efficient combination therapy, and discuss nano DDS that are associated with cancer immunotherapy and nano DDS strategies based on the  status in tumor microenvironments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30137232>  and cancer in the immunogenomics era.</a></h2><p>  have been the subject of a wave of new studies. Among these  are tytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4,  programmed death-1 and programmed death-ligand 1; their blockades have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for therapy of melanoma and other types of cancers. Immunogenomics, which combines the latest nucleic  sequencing strategy with immunotherapy, provides precise information about genomic alterations (e.g. mutations) and enables a paradigm shift of   therapy from tumor types to molecular signatures. Studying these critical  in relation to genomic mutations and neoantigens has produced groundbreaking results. This article examines these studies and delves into the relationships between   blockade and tumors harboring certain genomic mutations. Moreover, this article reviews recent studies on resistance to   therapy.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Superantigens, Gram-positive bacterial virulence factors, cause toxic shock and sepsis by hyperinducing inflammatory cytokines. We report a novel role for costimulatory receptors CD28 and B7-2 as obligatory receptors for superantigens, rendering them therapeutic targets. We show that by engaging not only CD28 but also its coligand B7-2 directly, superantigens potently enhance the interaction between B7-2 and CD28, inducing thereby T- hyperactivation. Using a conserved twelve amino- domain, superantigens engage both B7-2 and CD28 at their homodimer interfaces, sites far removed from where these receptors interact, implying that inflammatory signaling can be controlled through the receptor homodimer interfaces. Short B7-2 and CD28 dimer interface mimetic peptides bind diverse superantigens, prevent superantigen binding to -surface B7-2 or CD28, attenuate inflammatory cytokine overexpression, and protect mice from lethal superantigen challenge. Thus, superantigens induce a cytokine storm by mediating not only the interaction between MHC-II molecule and T- receptor but critically, by promoting B7-2/CD28 coreceptor engagement, forcing the principal costimulatory axis to signal excessively. Our findings highlight the B7/CD28 interaction as a bottleneck in signaling for expression of inflammatory cytokines. B7-2 and CD28 homodimer interface mimetic peptides prevent superantigen lethality by blocking the superantigen-host costimulatory receptor interaction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29511565>Combination   inhibitor therapy nivolumab and ipilimumab associated with multiple endocrinopathies.</a></h2><p>  inhibitors are the mainstay of treatment for advanced melanoma, and their use is being increasingly implicated in the development of autoimmune endocrinopathies. We present a case of a 52-year-old man with metastatic melanoma on combination nivolumab and ipilumimab therapy who developed concurrent hypophysitis, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and diabetes insipidus. He presented prior to third  of combination treatment with a headache, myalgias and fatigue. Biochemistry and MRI pituitary confirmed anterior pituitary dysfunction with a TSH: 0.02 mU/L (0.5-5.5 mU/L), fT4: 5.2 pmol/L (11-22 pmol/L), fT3: 4.0 pmol/L (3.2-6.4 pmol/L), cortisol (12:00 h): <9 nmol/L (74-286 nmol/L), FSH: 0.7 IU/L (1.5-9.7 IU/L), LH: <0.1 IU/L (1.8-9.2 IU/L), PRL: 1 mIU/L (90-400 mIU/L), SHBG: 34 nmol/L (19-764 nmol/L) and total testosterone: <0.4 nmol/L (9.9-27.8 nmol/L). High-dose dexamethasone (8 mg) was administered followed by hydrocortisone, thyroxine and topical testosterone replacement. Two weeks post administration of the third , he became unwell with lethargy, weight loss and nocturia. Central diabetes insipidus was diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and sodium of 149 mmol/L (135-145 mmol/L). Desmopressin nasal spray was instituted with symptom resolution and normalization of serum sodium. Three weeks later, he presented again polyuric and polydipsic. His capillary glucose was 20.8 mmol/L (ketones of 2.4 mmol), low C-peptide 0.05 nmol/L (0.4-1.5 nmol/L) and HbA1c of 7.7%. T1DM was suspected, and he was commenced on an insulin infusion with rapid symptom resolution. Insulin antibodies glutamic  decarboxylase (GAD), insulin antibody-2 (IA-2) and zinc transporter-8 (ZnT8) were negative. A follow-up MRI pituitary revealed findings consistent with recovering autoimmune hypophysitis. Immunotherapy was discontinued based on the extent of these autoimmune endocrinopathies.The most effective regime for treatment of metastatic melanoma is combination immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilumimab, and this therapy is associated with a high incidence of autoimmune endocrinopathies.Given the high prevalence of -related adverse events, the threshold for functional testing should be low.Traditional antibody testing may not be reliable to identify early-onset endocrinopathy.Routine screening pathways have yet to be adequately validated through clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28877632>Case report: pembrolizumab-induced Type 1 diabetes in a patient with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>  inhibitors are novel cancer therapies associated with numerous autoimmune toxicities, some of which are only now being appreciated.A 67-year old female with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and no prior history of diabetes was treated with leucovorin, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and pembrolizumab.

Aspirin (ASA) otherwise known as acetylsalicylic , is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has shown promising results in the prevention of chronic diseases, including several cancers. In previous studies, aspirin has been shown to reduce the incidence of CRC.   blockade of T  Ig and ITIM domain receptor (TIGIT) alone or combined with other   blockades moleculars has gained impressive results in the treatment of the melanoma and glioblastoma. Here, we found that TIGIT and Poliovirus receptor (PVR, CD155) are expressed in tumour cells; the TIGIT and CD155 protein expression in cancer tissue has been found to be significantly higher than that in the precancerous tissue. T  Ig and ITIM domain receptor and CD226 were expressed in the lymphocytes near the tumour tissue and the adjacent tissues. Aspirin has been found to inhibit cancer  viability and promote CRC  apoptosis.Similarly, aspirin has also been found to increase pro-apoptotic protein Bax's expression. We found that the expression of TIGIT decreased with an increase in the concentration of aspirin and that the suppression of TIGIT can affect the effect of aspirin on  proliferation. In this paper, we found that aspirin attenuates cancer  proliferation and induces CRC cells apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of TIGIT, which provides new evidence for the application of aspirin in cancer treatment.© 2019 The Authors.

Improving clinical responses to   blockade will require deeper understanding of factors that impact local  balance in the TME. Elevated catabolism of the amino  tryptophan (Trp) and arginine (Arg) is a common TME hallmark at clinical presentation of cancer. Cells catabolizing Trp and Arg suppress effector T cells and stabilize regulatory T cells to suppress immunity in chronic inflammatory diseases of clinical importance, including cancers. Processes that induce Trp and Arg catabolism in the TME remain incompletely defined. Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) and arginase 1 (ARG1), which catabolize Trp and Arg, respectively, respond to inflammatory cues including interferons and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) cytokines. Dying cells generate inflammatory signals including DNA, which is sensed to stimulate the production of type I interferons via the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) adaptor. Thus, dying cells help establish local conditions that suppress antitumour immunity to promote tumorigenesis. Here, we review evidence that Trp and Arg catabolism contributes to inflammatory processes that promote tumorigenesis, impede  responses to therapy and might promote neurological comorbidities associated with cancer.</p></html>
