Carcinogenesis alters lipid metabolism to facilitate cell growth and survival. For instance, metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are associated with increasing  cell proliferation. Moreover, precancerous  lesions (i.e. adenomas) increase the risk for colorectal . In this study, we investigated associations between plasma PUFAs and the number of  polyps and polyp type (i.e. hyperplastic and adenoma). Healthy male participants (n=126) of 48-65 years of age were recruited before a routine colonoscopy screening. Plasma phospholipid (PPL) PUFAs were isolated by means of solid phase extraction and methylated. Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed using gas chromatography. Factor analysis was used to cluster PUFAs into groups, and then generated factors and individual PUFAs were analyzed using polytomous logistic regression. In our age-adjusted and smoking-adjusted polytomous logistic regression, for each unit increase in PPL docosatetraenoic acid (DTA), individuals were 1.43 (1.00-2.06) and 1.33 (0.99-1.80) times more likely to have hyperplastic polyps and adenomas rather than no polyps, respectively. In our factor analysis, high PPL ω-6 PUFA and trans-fatty acid loading scores were associated with increased odds of adenoma presence rather than no polyps. Increases in long-chain PPL ω-6 PUFAs are associated with an increased risk for adenomas. As relative levels of DTA increase in PPLs, individuals had increased odds of having hyperplastic polyps and adenomas. Elevated conversion of ω-6 PUFAs to longer-chain ω- such as DTA may indicate altered PUFA metabolism at the tissue level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27101738>Knockdown of delta-5-desaturase promotes the anti- activity of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy in  cells expressing COX-2.</a></h2><p>Cyclooxygenase (COX), commonly overexpressed in  cells, is a major lipid peroxidizing enzyme that metabolizes polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3s and ω-). The COX-catalyzed free radical peroxidation of arachidonic acid (ω-6) can produce deleterious metabolites (e.g. 2-series prostaglandins) that are implicated in  development. Thus, COX inhibition has been intensively investigated as a complementary therapeutic strategy for . However, our previous study has demonstrated that a free radical-derived byproduct (8-hydroxyoctanoic acid) formed from COX-catalyzed peroxidation of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA, the precursor of arachidonic acid) can inhibit  cell growth. We thus hypothesize that the commonly overexpressed COX in  (~90% of  patients) can be taken advantage to suppress cell growth by knocking down delta-5-desaturase (D5D, a key enzyme that converts DGLA to arachidonic acid). In addition, D5D knockdown along with DGLA supplement may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. After knocking down D5D in HCA-7 colony 29 cells and HT-29 cells (human  cell lines with high and low COX levels, respectively), the antitumor activity of DGLA was significantly enhanced along with the formation of a threshold range (~0.5-1.0μM) of 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid. In contrast, DGLA treatment did not inhibit cell growth when D5D was not knocked down and only limited amount of 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid was formed. D5D knockdown along with DGLA treatment also enhanced the cytotoxicities of various chemotherapeutic drugs, including 5-fluorouracil, regorafenib, and irinotecan, potentially through the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. p53 and caspase 9. For the first time, we have demonstrated that the overexpressed COX in  cells can be utilized in suppressing  cell growth. This finding may provide a new option besides COX inhibition to optimize  therapy. The outcome of this translational research will guide us to develop a novel ω-6-based diet-care strategy in combination with current chemotherapy for  prevention and treatment.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28503853>Glucuronidation and its impact on the bioactivity of [6]-shogaol.</a></h2><p>-shogaol () from ginger has been reported to have diverse bioactivities and can be widely metabolized in animals and humans; however, the impact of glucuronidation on its bioactivity is still largely unknown. This study investigates the glucuronidation of  and its effect on cell cytotoxicity and Nrf2-inducing activities of .The glucuronidated metabolite of , 4-O-monoglucuronide  (-G), was synthesized and characterized for the first time. Glucuronidation of  in humans was studied using microsomes of the liver and intestine and recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs). The kinetics of  glucuronidation by human liver and intestinal microsomes followed the substrate inhibition kinetics model. The intrinsic glucuronidation clearance (CL ) of  in human liver microsomes was higher than that in human intestine microsomes. Among the recombinant UGTs examined, UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A6, 1A8, 1A10, 2B7, 2B15, and 2B17 exhibited glucuronidation activity toward , with UGT2B7 being the most potent one. Compared with , the glucuronidation of  largely eliminated its cell cytotoxicity against human  cell lines HT-116 and HT-29, and its Nrf2-inducing activity.The findings from current study provide foundations for understanding the role of glucuronidation in biotransformation and biological activities of .© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The HS sulfation pattern influences signaling events at the cell surface, which are critical for interactions with growth factors and their receptors. SULFs are overexpressed in several types of human tumors, but their role in  is still unclear because their molecular mechanism has not been fully explored and understood. To further investigate the functions of these sulfatases in tumorigenesis, stable overexpression models of these genes were generated in the colorectal  cells, Caco-2 and HCT-116. Importantly, mimicking overexpression of these sulfatases resulted in increased viability and proliferation, and augmented cell migration. These effects were reverted by shRNA-mediated knockdown of SULF1 or SULF2 and by the addition of unfractionated heparin. Detailed structural analysis of HS from cells overexpressing SULFs showed reduction in the trisulfated disaccharide UA(2S)-GlcNS() and corresponding increase in UA(2S)-GlcNS disaccharide, as well as an unexpected rise in less common disaccharides containing GlcNAc() residues. Moreover,  cells transfected with SULFs demonstrated increased Wnt signaling. In summary, SULF1 or SULF2 overexpression contributes to colorectal  cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.This study reveals that sulfatases have oncogenic effects in  cells, suggesting an important role for these enzymes in  progression.©2014 American Association for  Research.</p></html>
