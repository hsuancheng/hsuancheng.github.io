Its inhibitors may be applied to efficiently treat hyperpigmentation and are widely used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, food supplements and insecticides. Previous studies have shown that heterocyclic compounds with an amino group can inhibit tyrosinase activity. The present study aims to evaluate the inhibitory effect of some novel ,6-diamino-4-chloropyrimidine derivatives (1a-e) and ,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (2a-e) including bioactive aniline moiety on the activity of the mushroom tyrosinase.In practice, the azo salt was initially synthesized from aniline derivatives and combined subsequently with the ,4,6-triaminopyrimidine and ,6-diamino-4 chloropyrimidine followed by crystallization. The structures of resulting compounds were confirmed by FT-IR, C NMR, and H NMR. The derivatives (0-100 µM) were evaluated for their inhibitory effect on tyrosinase activity using l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) as substrate.All compounds showed inhibitory effects against the activity of the enzyme. About 23.72-55.08% inhibition was observed in the presence of 30 µM of each compound. The IC values of the synthesized compounds were measured, and their inhibition properties were also visualized by zymography. Based on the results, the compounds 1a-e and 2a-e showed moderate inhibitory activities. Notably, pyrimidine derivatives 1a (IC=24.68) and 1d (IC=24.45) also exhibited similar inhibitory activities when compared with the positive control, kojic acid (IC=25.24 µM). Kinetic studies indicated that the type of inhibition was noncompetitive.All results suggest that pyrimidine derivatives, especially 1d and 1a, can be considered as safe and efficient tyrosinase inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30883053>Transcatheter Aortic-Valve Replacement with a Self-Expanding Valve in Low-Risk Patients.</a></h1><p>Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at increased risk for death from surgery; less is known about TAVR in low-risk patients.We performed a randomized noninferiority trial in which TAVR with a self-expanding supraannular bioprosthesis was compared with surgical aortic-valve replacement in patients who had severe aortic stenosis and were at low surgical risk. When 850 patients had reached 12-month follow-up, we analyzed data regarding the primary end point, a composite of death or disabling stroke at 24 months, using Bayesian methods.Of the 1468 patients who underwent randomization, an attempted TAVR or surgical procedure was performed in 1403. The patients' mean age was 74 years. The 24-month estimated incidence of the primary end point was 5.3% in the TAVR group and 6.7% in the surgery group (difference, -1.4 percentage points; 95% Bayesian credible interval for difference, -4.9 to .1; posterior probability of noninferiority >0.999). At 30 days, patients who had undergone TAVR, as compared with surgery, had a lower incidence of disabling stroke (0.5% vs. 1.7%), bleeding complications (.4% vs. 7.5%), acute kidney injury (0.9% vs. .8%), and atrial fibrillation (7.7% vs. 35.4%) and a higher incidence of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (3.5% vs. 0.5%) and pacemaker implantation (17.4% vs. 6.1%). At 12 months, patients in the TAVR group had lower aortic-valve gradients than those in the surgery group (8.6 mm Hg vs. 11. mm Hg) and larger effective orifice areas (.3 cm vs. .0 cm).In patients with severe aortic stenosis who were at low surgical risk, TAVR with a self-expanding supraannular bioprosthesis was noninferior to surgery with respect to the composite end point of death or disabling stroke at 24 months.

Despite the multiple roles of adipose tissue in maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis, adipocytes are thought to be largely homogenous with only  major subtypes recognized in humans so far. Here we report the existence and characteristics of 4 distinct human adipocyte subtypes, and of their respective mesenchymal progenitors. The phenotypes of these distinct adipocyte subtypes are differentially associated with key adipose tissue functions, including thermogenesis, lipid storage, and adipokine secretion. The transcriptomic signature of "brite/beige" thermogenic adipocytes reveals mechanisms for iron accumulation and protection from oxidative stress, necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration upon activation. Importantly, this signature is enriched in human supraclavicular adipose tissue, confirming that these cells comprise thermogenic depots in vivo, and explain previous findings of a rate-limiting role of iron in adipose tissue . The mesenchymal progenitors that give rise to beige/brite adipocytes express a unique set of cytokines and transcriptional regulators involved in immune cell modulation of adipose tissue . Unexpectedly, we also find adipocyte subtypes specialized for high-level expression of the adipokines adiponectin or leptin, associated with distinct transcription factors previously implicated in adipocyte differentiation. The finding of a broad adipocyte repertoire derived from a distinct set of mesenchymal progenitors, and of the transcriptional regulators that can control their development, provides a framework for understanding human adipose tissue function and role in metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

As of October 22, 2019, 49 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and the U.S. Virgin Islands have reported 1,604 cases of EVALI to CDC, including 34 (.1%) EVALI-associated deaths in 24 states. Based on data collected as of October 15, 2019, this report updates data on patient characteristics and substances used in e-cigarette, or vaping, products () and describes characteristics of EVALI-associated deaths. The median age of EVALI patients who survived was 23 years, and the median age of EVALI patients who died was 45 years. Among 867 (54%) EVALI patients with available data on use of specific e-cigarette, or vaping, products in the 3 months preceding symptom onset, 86% reported any use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products, 64% reported any use of nicotine-containing products, and 52% reported use of both. Exclusive use of THC-containing products was reported by 34% of patients and exclusive use of nicotine-containing products by 11%, and for % of patients, no use of either THC- or nicotine-containing products was reported. Among 19 EVALI patients who died and for whom substance use data were available, 84% reported any use of THC-containing products, including 63% who reported exclusive use of THC-containing products; 37% reported any use of nicotine-containing products, including 16% who reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. To date, no single compound or ingredient used in e-cigarette, or vaping, products has emerged as the cause of EVALI, and there might be more than one cause. Because most patients reported using THC-containing products before symptom onset, CDC recommends that persons should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC. In addition, because the specific compound or ingredient causing lung injury is not yet known, and while the investigation continues, persons should consider refraining from the use of all e-cigarette, or vaping, products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659899>Identification and Characterization of the Tyrosinase Inhibitory Activity of Caffeine from Camellia Pollen.</a></h1><p>Tyrosinase inhibitors are important in cosmetic, medical and food industries due to their regulation of melanin production. A tyrosinase inhibitor was purified from Camellia pollen using high-speed countercurrent chromatography and preparative HPLC and was identiﬁed as caffeine by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. It showed strong mushroom tyrosinase inhibitory activity with an IC of 18.5 ± .31μg/mL in a noncompetitive model. The caffeine did not interact with copper ions in the active center of the enzyme but could quench ﬂuorescence intensity and change the secondary conformation of this tyrosinase. A molecular dynamics simulation showed that caffeine bound this tyrosinase via Lys379, Lys 376, Asp357, Glu356, Thr308, Gln307, Asp312 and Trp358, thus changing the binding sites of L-tyrosine and the loop conformation adjacent to the active center. In vitro cell model analysis revealed that caffeine exhibited significant inhibitory effects on both intracellular tyrosinase activity and melanin production of B16-F10 melanoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These comprehensive results suggest that caffeine is a strong tyrosinase inhibitor that has the potentials to be developed as skin-whitening agents in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries or as anti- agents in food industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673154>Oxygen and contact with human intestinal epithelium independently stimulate virulence gene expression in enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) are important intestinal pathogens causing acute and persistent diarrhoeal illness worldwide. Although many putative EAEC virulence factors have been identified, their association with pathogenesis remains unclear. As environmental cues can modulate bacterial virulence, we investigated the effect of oxygen and human intestinal epithelium on EAEC virulence gene expression to determine the involvement of respective gene products in intestinal colonisation and pathogenesis. Using in vitro organ culture of human intestinal biopsies, we established the colonic epithelium as the major colonisation site of EAEC strains 042 and 17-. We subsequently optimised a vertical diffusion chamber system with polarised T84 colon carcinoma cells for EAEC infection and showed that oxygen induced expression of the global regulator AggR, aggregative adherence fimbriae, E. coli common pilus, EAST-1 toxin, and dispersin in EAEC strain 042 but not in 17-. Furthermore, the presence of T84 epithelia stimulated additional expression of the mucinase Pic and the toxins HlyE and Pet. This induction was dependent on physical host cell contact and did not require AggR. Overall, these findings suggest that EAEC virulence in the human gut is modulated by environmental signals including oxygen and the intestinal epithelium.© 2019 The Authors Cellular Microbiology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977919>Effect of Dipping and Vacuum Impregnation Pretreatments on the Quality of Frozen Apples: A Comparative Study on Organic and Conventional Fruits.</a></h1><p>The effect of dipping and vacuum impregnation (VI) pretreatments with lemon juice solution on the quality and stability of organic and conventional frozen apples was investigated. Fresh apples were characterized; organic apples showed, at equal starch and ripeness index, a lower sugar content, and higher acidity than conventional ones. The polyphenol content was slightly higher in organic apples than in conventional ones while polyphenoloxidase activity was similar. No differences in color and firmness were evidenced. Dipping affected organic and conventional apples' color by determining an increase of lightness (ΔL ≈ 4) and h° (Δh° ≈ 6) parameters. VI reduced the lightness of apples (ΔL ≈ -3) but the addition of lemon juice counterbalanced the lightness reduction by increasing ΔL from 3 to 1.5 ca. Pretreatments did not affect the firmness of organic fruits while impaired that of the conventional ones ( 26% on average), likely due to different fruit matrix porosity and cell wall composition. Freezing (-40 °C) and frozen storage (up to 300 days) dramatically reduced the firmness of organic (42%) and conventional products (58%). At equal pretreatment and storage time (that is, 15, 30, 300 days), higher firmness retention was evidenced in organic apples than in conventional ones. All through frozen storage, VI was shown to better preserve the mechanical properties of organic apples than that of conventional ones. Both freezing and frozen storage reduced the hue of frozen apple products by up to 8% due to  reactions. Lemon juice addition increased the hue of both frozen samples and thawed samples by about % all through storage time.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337150>Travelers to U.S.: Zika Virus Knowledge, Attitudes, and Determinants of Practices in the Middle East-Insights for Future Awareness Campaigns.</a></h1><p>Travelers act as sentinels for the spread of Zika virus. Imported Zika cases and the presence of Zika virus-transmitting mosquitoes have been documented in the Middle East. However, data on travelers' knowledge, attitude and practices regarding Zika and its prevention measures within the Middle East are scarce. This study aimed to address this issue in a sample of Jordanian and non-Jordanian travelers to U.S. in Jordan. A paper-based questionnaire was distributed to 301 travelers to U.S. in Queen Alia International airport, Amman, Jordan. Only .7% of the travelers knew that Zika is associated with birth defects. A total of 10.4% of the participants knew that the bite of infected mosquitoes is a route of Zika transmission. Only 12.6% of respondents correctly identified Zika prevention measures. The level of education and future plans for pregnancy were significantly associated with a high knowledge score (R = 0.140, -value < 0.005). Although 76.% of the travelers perceived Zika as a health threat, only 11.% believed in the efficacy of the prevention measures. Formulation of educational campaigns within Middle Eastern countries and development of awareness strategies regarding Zika and its prevention within the airports are required.

Here we present a graph reference genome implementation that enables read alignment across ,800 diploid genomes encompassing 12.6 million SNPs and 4.0 million insertions and deletions (indels). The pipeline processes one whole-genome sequencing sample in 6.5 h using a system with 36 CPU cores. We show that using a graph genome reference improves read mapping sensitivity and produces a 0.5% increase in variant calling recall, with unaffected specificity. Structural variations incorporated into a graph genome can be genotyped accurately under a unified framework. Finally, we show that iterative augmentation of graph genomes yields incremental gains in variant calling accuracy. Our implementation is an important advance toward fulfilling the promise of graph genomes to radically enhance the scalability and accuracy of genomic analyses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572455>Low expression of brown and beige fat genes in subcutaneous tissues in obese patients.</a></h1><p>The molecular mechanisms behind obesity pathogenesis remain largely undefined. Impairment in the  process of subcutaneous tissues proposed to contribute to obesity pathogenesis. In the current study, we aimed to assess whether the expression of brown fat genes in subcutaneous tissues in obese patients is altered as compared to non-obese patients.Participants were recruited from patients undergoing general surgeries. At the same site of surgery, biopsies were taken from the abdominal subcutaneous tissues from each participant, along with a venous blood sample. The expression of BAT genes was measured using a real-time PCR method. Serum FGF21 was measured using an ELISA kit, and the serum blood lipid profile was measured using the Dimension VistaTM 1500 System.A total of 58 surgical patients was involved. A low expression of BAT genes was observed in the groups with higher body mass index (BMI) (< 30 kg/m) as compared to the groups with lower BMI (> 30 kg/m). The expression of CIDEA and CITED1 was significantly higher in the patients with normal weight as compared to obese ( = 0.01 and  = 0.02, respectively). A significant negative correlation was found between the expression of BAT genes and BMI in patients with BMI < 35 kg/m. However, the strongest negative correlation was observed in the expression of CIDEA ( = -0.5,  = 0.004), followed by TBX1 ( = -0.4,  = 0.01), CITED1, and ZIC1 ( = -0.4,  = 0.03). Whereas the correlation of UCP1 with BMI remained insignificant ( = -0.29,  = 0.08). When including patients with BMI > 35 kg/m, the correlation decreased and became insignificant ( = 0.08). No significant correlation was found between the expression of BAT genes and blood lipid profiles ( > 0.05). Serum FGF21 was positively and significantly correlated to the expression of UCP1 ( = 0.56,  = 0.02) and TBX1 ( = 0.62,  = 0.01), however, this correlation was missing in patients with severe obesity.Our data suggested that brown and beige genes expression in abdominal subcutaneous tissues is dysregulated in patients with obesity.

In this study, we used a DH line for QTL analyses, for the first time in a fruit tree, expecting it to simplify the analysis of the inheritance of quantitative traits and thus to enhance QTL detection power. Using an F population from 'Prima' × 'Apple Chukanbohon 95P6' (DH), we constructed a genetic map of 'Prima', and identified 19 QTLs for 13 traits. These QTLs had comparatively high LOD scores and explained a large part of the variation of the phenotypes. In particular, acidity, juice , and skin splitting clearly segregated at a 1:1 ratio, consistent with the segregation of the alleles at the detected QTLs in linkage group 16; these traits appeared to be regulated by single genes, despite general consideration that they are quantitative traits. Using this simple genetic composition of the F population, we concluded that the skin splitting of apple fruit has recessive inheritance, and that the allele for splitting is tightly linked with those for high acidity and low juice  in 'Prima'.Copyright © 2019 by JAPANESE SOCIETY OF BREEDING.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30938559>Effects of Adaptive Hearing Aid Directionality and Noise Reduction on Masked Speech Recognition for Children Who Are Hard of Hearing.</a></h1><p>Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate speech-in-noise and speech-in-speech recognition associated with activation of a fully adaptive directional hearing aid algorithm in children with mild to severe bilateral sensory/neural hearing loss. Method Fourteen children (5-14 years old) who are hard of hearing participated in this study. Participants wore laboratory hearing aids. Open-set word recognition thresholds were measured adaptively for  hearing aid settings: (a) omnidirectional (OMNI) and (b) fully adaptive directionality. Each hearing aid setting was evaluated in 3 listening conditions. Fourteen children with normal hearing served as age-matched controls. Results Children who are hard of hearing required a more advantageous signal-to-noise ratio than children with normal hearing to achieve comparable performance in all 3 conditions. For children who are hard of hearing, the average improvement in signal-to-noise ratio when comparing fully adaptive directionality to OMNI was 4.0 dB in noise, regardless of target location. Children performed similarly with fully adaptive directionality and OMNI settings in the presence of the speech maskers. Conclusions Compared to OMNI, fully adaptive directionality improved speech recognition in steady noise for children who are hard of hearing, even when they were not facing the target source. This algorithm did not affect speech recognition when the background noise was speech. Although the use of hearing aids with fully adaptive directionality is not proposed as a substitute for remote microphone systems, it appears to offer several advantages over fixed directionality, because it does not depend on children facing the target talker and provides access to multiple talkers within the environment. Additional experiments are required to further evaluate children's performance under a variety of spatial configurations in the presence of both noise and speech maskers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049967>Shelf-life study of ready-to-cook slices of globe artichoke 'Spinoso sardo': effects of anti- solutions and edible coating enriched with Foeniculum vulgare essential oil.</a></h1><p>The globe artichoke [Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus (L.) Fiori] is a natural source of minerals, fiber, inulin, and polyphenols. A ready-to-cook (RTC) version of this product could improve its commercialization and consumption. In this study, the effects of (i) anti- treatments (citric acid 0.5% + ascorbic acid %, or cysteine 0.5%, w/v) and (ii) dipping in locust bean gum (LBG) edible coating with or without Foeniculum vulgare essential oil (EO) were evaluated on RTC globe artichoke slices cv. 'Spinoso sardo' during storage (11 days at 4 °C). Fresh weight loss, color, texture, polyphenol oxidase (PPO), microbiological and chemical parameters, antioxidant capacity, and sensory descriptors were determined.The results showed that, despite the antioxidant treatment used, when EO was added to LBG, all microbiological groups underwent an average reduction of 0.50 log CFU g . Cysteine preserved the antioxidant capacity, color, and texture of samples better than citric acid and ascorbic acid, and inhibited PPO; the addition of EO to LBG enhanced these effects. At the end of the storage period, the overall highest sensory attribute score was attained by the coated globe artichoke samples with EO.The marked efficacy of the LBG edible coating with added F. vulgare EO in maintaining microbiological, physical, chemical, and sensory qualities makes it a promising processing tool for the preservation of ready-to-cook Spinoso sardo globe artichoke slices during storage for 11 days at 4 °C. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316571>An Ancient Chinese Herbal Decoction Containing Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Astragali Radix, Jujuba Fructus, and Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens Stimulates the  Conversion of White Adipocyte in Cultured 3T3-L1 Cells.</a></h1><p>Abnormal storage of white adipocyte tissue (WAT) is the major factor causing obesity. The promising strategies for obesity treatment are building up the brown adipocyte tissue (BAT) and/or expedite fatty acid catabolism. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) sheds light on preventing obesity. Ginger is one of the most effective herbs for antiobesity by accelerating  WAT. To fortify the antiobesity effect of ginger, an ancient Chinese herbal decoction composed of four herbs, Angelicae Sinensis Radix (ASR), Astragali Radix (AR), Jujuba Fructus (JF), and Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens (ZRR; ginger), was tested here: this herbal formula was written in AD 1155, named as Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT). Therefore, the antiobesity function of this ancient herbal decoction was revealed  by cultured 3T3-L1 cells.The lipid accumulation was detected by Oil Red O staining. Furthermore, the underlying working mechanisms of antiobesity functions of DBT were confirmed in 3T3-L1 cells by confocal microscopy, western blot, and RT-PCR.DBT was able to actuate brown fat-specific gene activations, which included (i) expression of PPAR, UCP1, and PCG1 and (ii) fatty acid oxidation genes, i.e., CPT1A and HSL. The increase of  WAT, triggered by DBT, was possibly mediated by a Ca-AMPK signaling pathway, because the application of Ca chelator, BAMPTA-AM, reversed the effect.These findings suggested that the herbal mixture DBT could potentiate the antiobesity functions of ginger, which might have potential therapeutic implications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30675120>Production of Bone Broth Powder with Spray Drying Using Three Different Carrier Agents.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study is to determine the some physicochemical (proximate composition, pH and a values) and reconstitution (wettability, dispersibility and solubility index (SI)) properties of spray-dried bone broth powder (BBP) along with the effects of the addition of different carrier agents.

The Sec pathway is the standard means of transporting the target protein but it is unable to transport complex or rapidly folding proteins because the Sec system can only transport proteins in an unfolded state. The Tat system also operates to transport proteins to the periplasm, and it has significant potential as an alternative means of recombinant protein production because it transports fully folded proteins. Here, we have tested the Tat system's full potential for the production of biotherapeutics for the first time using fed-batch fermentation. We expressed human growth hormone (hGH) with a Tat signal peptide in E. coli W3110 "TatExpress" strains that contain elevated levels of the Tat apparatus. This construct contained four amino acids from TorA at the hGH N-terminus as well as the initiation methionine from hGH, which is removed in vivo. We show that the protein is efficiently exported to the periplasm during extended fed-batch fermentation, to the extent that it is by far the most abundant protein in the periplasm. The protein was shown to be homogeneous, disulfide bonded, and active. The bioassay showed that the yields of purified periplasmic hGH are 5.4 g/L culture whereas an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay gave a figure of .39 g/L. Separate analysis of a TorA signal peptide linked to hGH construct lacking any additional amino acids likewise showed efficient export to the periplasm, although yields were approximately two-fold lower.© 2019 The Authors.

"Sawi" fruit during cold storage.</a></h1><p>The pineapples were dipped in salicylic acid (SA) (.5 or 5.0 mM) or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) (0.01 or 0.1 mM) for 1, , or 3 hr and then held at 13 ± 1°C for 10 days. The parameters were determined after left the fruits at 25°C for  days. It was found that, in the tissue adjacent to the core, 5.0 mM SA for  hr and 0.01 mM MeJA for 3 hr alleviated chilling injury (CI) and maintained color than other treatments. The MeJA immersions lowered CI score, electrolyte leakage, and malondialdehyde content greater than other treatments. SA and MeJA immersions retarded polyphenol oxidase activity, total phenols, and induced antioxidant activity during storage. In the pulp tissue, SA treatment increased ascorbic acid and total sugar contents, and MeJA immersions enhanced bioactive compound and antioxidant enzyme activities than SA immersion. Therefore, MeJA immersions could alleviate CI and enhance antioxidant better than other treatments of pineapples during cold storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Postharvest immersion at the optimum concentration of SA or MeJA can be applied for commercial scale in order to alleviate chilling of "Sawi" pineapple fruit during storage. MeJA treatment enhances antioxidant activity and reduces internal  better than SA treatment in pineapple.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30835453>Unexpected Potential of Iso-oligosaccharides in the Generation of Important Food Odorants.</a></h1><p>The generation of selected Maillard-derived odorants from iso-oligosaccharides (IOSs), namely, from isomaltose, isomaltotriose, isomaltulose, and melibiose, was studied and compared with that from other oligosaccharides (maltose, lactose, and panose) and monosaccharides (glucose, galactose, and fructose).

The US alone and PS + BL treatments resulted in 3.02 ± 0.52 and 1.06 ± 0.13 log reduction of E. coli; 0.18 ± 0.14 and .34 ± 0.13 log reduction of S. aureus, respectively. The combination of PS + US + BL treatment at optimized conditions resulted in .35 ± 0.16 log reduction of S. aureus. An additive effect on the inactivation of E. coli (4.26 ± 0.32 log reduction) was observed with PS + US + BL combination treatment. The US treatment showed significant change in cloud value, colour and  index of orange juice. The combinational non-thermal processes (PS + BL and PS + US + BL) did not have any significant effect on total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and hesperidin content of the orange juice. However, these processes affected ascorbic acid content and antioxidant activity negatively. Thus, this study indicated that photodynamic inactivation of E. coli and S. aureus using LED-based photosensitization in fruit juices could be a potential method for microbial inactivation. Nevertheless, the effect on quality parameters needs to be considered while optimizing the process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Excepting the colouring agents, food/beverage contains compounds from the matrix or other additives/ingredients. Present study reveals the influences of nineteen food additives/ingredients on the stability, colour parameters and radical scavenging activity during 20 weeks of storage of red cabbage waste hydroethanolic extract (initial pH = 6.31) under aerobic atmosphere, in the dark, at 4 °C. At studied concentration (0.%), most important changes were produced by tartaric and citric acids: decrease of monomeric anthocyanins content, lightness, radical scavenging activity, and increase of polymeric colour,  and degradation indices, chroma and red colour parameter, absolute value of blue colour parameter and hue angle, inducing very important overall colourimetric differences. Similar influences, but much attenuated, proved ascorbic and benzoic acids. During storage, the untreated extracts revealed a very high stability, and also mostly of treated extracts (especially with sugars).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The white adipose tissue (WAT) is the main deposit of lipids when there is an excess of energy. Its pathological growth is directly linked to the development of obesity and to a wide number of comorbidities, such as insulin-resistance, cardiovascular disease, among others. In this scenario, it becomes imperative to develop new approaches to the treatment and prevention of obesity and its comorbidities. It has been documented that the  of WAT could be a suitable strategy to tackle the obesity epidemic that is developing worldwide. Currently there is an intense search for bioactive compounds with anti-obesity properties, which present the particular ability to generate thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) or beige. The present study provide recent information of the bioactive nutritional compounds capable of inducing thermogenesis and therefore capable of generate positive effects on health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31167938>A Prediction Model to Identify Febrile Infants ≤60 Days at Low Risk of Invasive Bacterial Infection.</a></h1><p>To derive and internally validate a prediction model for the identification of febrile infants ≤60 days old at low probability of invasive bacterial infection (IBI).We conducted a case-control study of febrile infants ≤60 days old who presented to the emergency departments of 11 hospitals between July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2016. Infants with IBI, defined by growth of a pathogen in blood (bacteremia) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (bacterial meningitis), were matched by hospital and date of visit to  control patients without IBI. Ill-appearing infants and those with complex chronic conditions were excluded. Predictors of IBI were identified with multiple logistic regression and internally validated with 10-fold cross-validation, and an IBI score was calculated.We included 181 infants with IBI (155 [85.6%] with bacteremia without meningitis and 26 [14.4%] with bacterial meningitis) and 362 control patients. Twenty-three infants with IBI (12.7%) and 138 control patients (38.1%) had fever by history only. Four predictors of IBI were identified (area under the curve 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79-0.86]) and incorporated into an IBI score: age <21 days (1 point), highest temperature recorded in the emergency department 38.0-38.4°C ( points) or ≥38.5°C (4 points), absolute neutrophil count ≥5185 cells per μL ( points), and abnormal urinalysis results (3 points). The sensitivity and specificity of a score ≥ were 98.8% (95% CI: 95.7%-99.9%) and 31.3% (95% CI: 26.3%-36.6%), respectively. All 26 infants with meningitis had scores ≥.Infants ≤60 days old with fever by history only, a normal urinalysis result, and an absolute neutrophil count <5185 cells per μL have a low probability of IBI.Copyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145227>Prophylactic Autologous Slings at the Time of Obstetric Fistula Repair: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>To compare prophylactic slings for women with obstetric fistulas at high risk of residual incontinence.This was a multiple-site randomized controlled trial comparing autologous fascia slings to pubococcygeal (PC) slings at time of fistula repair. Women with a Goh type 3 or 4 vesicovaginal fistula (distal edge of the fistula is ≤.5 cm from the external urethral orifice) with no prior repair were randomized to receive either a rectus fascia sling or a PC sling while undergoing fistula repair. Interviews were performed before surgery and at follow-up 1 to 6 months later including the Michigan Incontinence Symptom Index and the Incontinence Quality of Life Tool. Pad weights were also collected at this time. Safety analysis was performed after 10 participants were enrolled in each arm.Eleven participants randomized to a PC sling and 10 to a rectus sling. There was 1 repair breakdown in the PC group and 3 in the rectus group. There was no significant difference noted in pad weights or quality of life scores between groups. Quality of life and Michigan Incontinence Symptom Index scores improved significantly for both groups after surgery. The study was terminated at safety analysis due to the number of breakdowns and difficulty of follow-up at 1 site.There was no superiority between slings.

To the contrary, deficiency of an anti-oxidizing enzyme, glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1, was reported to enhance insulin signaling, suggesting that oxidative stress may inhibit the development of type  diabetes. However, the beneficial effects of the absence of GPx-1 in metabolic homeostasis, including body weight control, have not yet been clearly manifested. To clarify the relationship between oxidative stress and obesity-related metabolic disorders, we investigated another mouse deficient with both GPx-1 and catalase (Cat).C57BL/6J wild-type and GPx-1 × Cat mice were fed with a high-fat diet (60% fat) or a normal chow diet for 16 weeks and were investigated for metabolic and histological studies.Body weight gain was significantly reduced, and glucose metabolism as well as hepatic steatosis was obviously improved in the GPx-1 × Cat mice. The serum levels of insulin and total cholesterol were also significantly lowered.

The best approach to treating patients with CI-DME and good visual acuity (20/25 or better) is unknown.To compare vision loss at  years among eyes initially managed with aflibercept, laser photocoagulation, or observation.Randomized clinical trial conducted at 91 US and Canadian sites among 702 adults with type 1 or type  diabetes. Participants had 1 study eye with CI-DME and visual acuity of 20/25 or better. The first participant was randomized on November 8, 2013, and the final date of follow-up was September 11, 2018.Eyes were randomly assigned to .0 mg of intravitreous aflibercept (n = 226) as frequently as every 4 weeks, focal/grid laser photocoagulation (n = 240), or observation (n = 236). Aflibercept was required for eyes in the laser photocoagulation or observation groups that had decreased visual acuity from baseline by at least 10 letters (≥  lines on an eye chart) at any visit or by 5 to 9 letters (1- lines) at  consecutive visits.The primary outcome was at least a 5-letter visual acuity decrease from baseline at  years. Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration adverse events (defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular or unknown death) were reported.Among 702 randomized participants (mean age, 59 years; 38% female [n=264]), 625 of 681 (92% excluding deaths) completed the -year visit. For eyes with visual acuity that decreased from baseline, aflibercept was initiated in 25% (60/240) and 34% (80/236) in the laser photocoagulation and observation groups, respectively. At  years, the percentage of eyes with at least a 5-letter visual acuity decrease was 16% (33/205), 17% (36/212), and 19% (39/208) in the aflibercept, laser photocoagulation, and observation groups, respectively (aflibercept vs laser photocoagulation risk difference, -% [95% CI, -9% to 5%]; relative risk, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.57-1.35; P = .79]; aflibercept vs observation risk difference, -3% [95% CI, -11% to 4%]; relative risk, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.55-1.27; P = .79]; laser photocoagulation vs observation risk difference, -1% [95% CI, -9% to 6%]; relative risk, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.64-1.41; P = .79]).

Brown adipose tissue (AT) regulates energy expenditure through the activity of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). White AT  is the process by which some adipocytes within AT depots acquire properties of brown adipocytes ("brite" adipocytes) and it correlates with metabolic improvement. We analyzed determinants of REE in patients with obesity and assessed  expression as a "brite" marker in abdominal subcutaneous AT (SAT) and visceral omental AT (VAT). Clinical data, REE, free fat mass (FFM), and fat mass (FM) were determined in 209 patients with obesity. , PPARG coactivator 1 alpha (), transcription factor A, mitochondrial (), T-box transcription factor 1 (), and solute carrier family 27 member 1 () expression was assayed in SAT and VAT samples, obtained during sleeve gastrectomy from 62 patients with obesity. REE and body composition data were also available for a subgroup of 35 of whom. In 209 patients with obesity a multiple regression model was computed with REE as the dependent variable and sex, waist, FFM, FM, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA), interleukin-6 and High Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol as the independent variables. Only FFM, FM and HOMA were independently correlated with REE ( = 0.787, AdjRsqr = 0.602). In each patient VAT displayed a higher , and  expression than SAT and  expression in VAT (-VAT) correlated with Body Mass Index (BMI) ( = 0.287,  < 0.05). Introducing -VAT in the multivariate model, we showed that FFM, HOMA, interleukin-6, High Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol, and -VAT were independent factors correlated with REE ( = 0.736, AdjRsqr = 0.612). We confirmed that REE correlates with FFM, FM and HOMA in a large cohort of patients. Our results clearly showed that -VAT expression was significantly increased in severe human obesity (BMI > 50 kg/m) and that it behaved as an independent predictor of REE. Lastly, we suggest that an increased REE and  in metabolically complicated severe obesity could represent an effort to counteract further weight gain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042399>Perinatal high-fat diet alters development of GABA receptor subunits in dorsal motor nucleus of vagus.</a></h1><p>Perinatal high-fat diet (pHFD) exposure increases the inhibition of dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) neurons, potentially contributing to the dysregulation of gastric functions. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that pHFD increases the inhibition of DMV neurons by disrupting GABA receptor subunit development. In vivo gastric recordings were made from adult anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats fed a control or pHFD (14 or 60% kcal from fat, respectively) from embryonic  (E13) to postnatal  (P42), and response to brainstem microinjection of benzodiazepines was assessed. Whole cell patch clamp recordings from DMV neurons assessed the functional expression of GABA α subunits, whereas mRNA and protein expression were measured via qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. pHFD decreased basal antrum and corpus motility, whereas brainstem microinjection of L838,417 (positive allosteric modulator of α subunit-containing GABA receptors) produced a larger decrease in gastric tone and motility. GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in pHFD DMV neurons were responsive to L838,417 throughout development, unlike control DMV neurons, which were responsive only at early postnatal timepoints. Brainstem mRNA and protein expression of the GABA α and  subunits, however, did not differ between control and pHFD rats. This study suggests that pHFD exposure arrests the development of synaptic GABA α receptor subunits on DMV neurons and that functional synaptic expression is maintained into adulthood, although cellular localization may differ. The tonic activation of slower GABA α subunit-containing receptors implies that such developmental changes may contribute to the observed decreased gastric motility.  Vagal neurocircuits involved in the control of gastric functions, satiation, and food intake are subject to significant developmental regulation postnatally, with immature GABA receptors expressing slower α-subunits, whereas mature GABA receptor express faster α-subunits. After perinatal high-fat diet exposure, this developmental regulation of dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) neurons is disrupted, increasing their tonic GABAergic inhibition, decreasing efferent output, and potentially decreasing gastric motility.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663108>Effects of Sargaquinoic Acid in Sargassum Serratifolium on Inducing Brown Adipocyte-like Phenotype in Mouse Adipocytes In Vitro.</a></h1><p>A previous study showed that the meroterpenoid-rich fraction of an ethanolic extract of  (MES) stimulated adipose tissue  and inhibited diet-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome.

SQA at .5 - 10 µM induced the differentiation of white adipocytes to beige adipocytes partially by increasing the mitochondrial density and the expression of beige/brown adipocyte markers. In addition, SQA activated lipid catabolic pathways, evidenced by the increased expression levels of perilipin, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1.

Upon activation, brown adipose tissue (BAT) clears vast amounts of lipids and glucose from the circulation and thus substantially lowers plasma lipid levels. As a consequence, BAT activation protects from the development of atherosclerosis. However, it is unclear if pharmacologic activation of BAT can be exploited therapeutically to reduce plaque burden in established atherosclerotic disease. Here we study the impact of thermogenic adipose tissues on plaque regression in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. Thermogenic adipocytes in atherosclerotic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR)-deficient mice were pharmacologically activated by dietary CL316,243 (CL) treatment for 4 weeks and the outcomes on metabolically active tissues, plasma lipids and atherosclerosis were analyzed. While the chronic activation of thermogenic adipocytes reduced adiposity, increased  of white adipose tissue (WAT), altered liver gene expression, and reduced plasma triglyceride levels, atherosclerotic plaque burden remained unchanged. Our findings suggest that despite improving adiposity and plasma triglycerides, pharmacologic activation of thermogenic adipocytes is not able to reverse atherosclerosis in LDLR-deficient mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30733760>Expression, purification and biological characterisation of recombinant human irisin (12.5 kDa).</a></h1><p>Fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5) is a transmembrane protein.

We purified recombinant human irisin (rh-irisin) to 95% homogeneity with simple purification method with a yield of 25 mg/g wet cell pellet. rh-irisin has been detected by commercially available antibodies from different sources with similar antigenicity. Biological activity of the rh-irisin was confirmed by using 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation by Oil red O staining. Further, rh-irisin treatment on pre-adipocytes showed increased expression of markers associated with energy expenditure. As it is involved in energy expenditure process, it could be considered as potential therapeutic option for various metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30681105>Germinated soy germ extract ameliorates obesity through beige fat activation.</a></h1><p>Obesity is a worldwide public health concern requiring safe and effective strategies. Recent studies suggest that bioactive compounds from soybeans have beneficial effects on weight loss and reducing fat accumulation. However, despite the biochemical and nutritional changes during germination, the biological effects of germinated soy germ have not been fully investigated. In this article, germinated soy germ extract (GSGE) was evaluated as a potential treatment option for obesity using 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. In vitro studies demonstrated that GSGE suppressed the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into mature adipocytes, along with reductions in lipid accumulation and lipid droplet formation. In vivo studies also showed that a daily dose of 1 mg kg-1 of GSGE reduced weight gain, adipocyte area, serum triglyceride, and LDL-cholesterol in HFD-fed mice. The GSGE treatment promoted , which was associated with increased UCP1 expression in vitro and in vivo. In addition, GSGE treatment induced beige fat activation by upregulation of lipolysis and beta-oxidation. Furthermore, gene and protein expression levels of endocannabinoid system-related factors such as NAPE-PLD, FAAH, DAGL-α, and CB2 were altered along with  and beige fat activation by GSGE. The present study indicates that GSGE effectively inhibits lipid accumulation and promotes beige fat transition and activation. Therefore, we suggest that GSGE treatment could be a promising strategy for the prevention of obesity by promoting weight loss, reducing fat accumulation, and improving obesity-related metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30845946>Physical activity, screen time, and outdoor learning environment practices and policy implementation: a cross sectional study of Texas child care centers.</a></h1><p>Early care and education (ECE) centers are important for combating childhood obesity.

The purpose of this study is to describe self-reported practices, outdoor environment aspects, and center policies for physical activity and screen time in a statewide convenience sample of non-Head Start Texas ECE centers.Licensed home and child care centers in Texas with email addresses publicly available on the Department of Family and Protective Services website (N = 6568) were invited to participate in an online survey. Descriptive statistics of self-reported practices, policies, and outdoor learning environment are described.827 surveys were collected (response rate = 12.6%). Exclusion criteria yielded a cross-sectional sample of 481 center-only respondents. > 80% of centers meet best practice recommendations for screen time practices for infants and toddlers, although written policies were low (M = 1.4 policies, SD = 1.65, range = 0-6). For physical activity, < 30% meet best practice recommendations with M = 3.9 policies (SD = 3.0, range = 0-10) policies reported. Outdoor learning environment indicators (M = 5.7 policies, SD = .5, range = 0-12) and adequate play settings, storage (< 40%), and greenery (< 20%) were reported.This statewide convenience sample of non-Head Start Texas ECE centers shows numerous opportunities for improvement in practices and policies surrounding outdoor environments, physical activity, and screen time. With less than half of centers meeting the recommendations for physical activity and outdoor learning environments, dedicating resources to help centers enact and modify written policies and to implement programs to improve their outdoor learning environments could promote physical activity and reduce sedentary time of children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550180>Stimulation of histamine H4 receptor participates in cold-induced  of subcutaneous white adipose tissue.</a></h1><p>Although many studies have shown that histamine and its signaling regulate energy homeostasis through the CNS (central nervous system), its role in adipose tissues remains poorly understood. Here, we identified the HrH4 (histamine H4 receptor) was highly expressed in adipocytes, at a level higher than that of the other three receptors (i.e., HrH1, HrH2, and HrH3). The HrH4 expression in adipocytes responded to cold through thermogenesis and lipolysis, supported by results from both mouse and cell models. When HrH4 expression was knocked down in the scWAT (subcutaneous white adipose tissue),  and lipolysis effects triggered by cold were ablated, and the oxygen consumption was also lowered both at the normal and cold conditions. Moreover, mice exhibited browned scWAT, accelerated metabolic rates, and tolerance to hypothermia when 4MH (4-methylhistamine), a selective HrH4 agonist, was adjacently injected to the scWAT. Consistent with these findings, 4MH also triggered the  and lipolytic effects in cultured C3H10T1/ adipocytes. Mechanically, we demonstrated that p38/MAPK and ERK/MAPK pathways were involved in these processes.

Nationally representative information on changes of perioperative outcomes and utilization of surgery in the growing eligible population (class III obesity or class II obesity with comorbidities) is lacking.Adults with obesity diagnosis who underwent primary bariatric surgery in the United States from 1993 to 2016 were identified in the National Inpatient Sample database. Estimates of the yearly number, types and cost of surgeries, patients' and hospital characteristics, complications and mortality rates were obtained. Prevalence of obesity and comorbidities were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and changes in utilization of surgery were estimated.An estimated 1,903,273 patients underwent bariatric surgery in the United States between 1993 and 2016. Mean age was 43.9 years (79.9% women, 70.9% white race, 70.7% commercial insurance); these and other characteristics changed over time. Surgeries were exclusively open operations in 1993 (n = 8,631; gastric bypass and vertical banded gastroplasty, 49% each) and 98% laparoscopic (n = 162,969; 69.8% sleeve gastrectomy and 27.8% gastric bypass) in 2016. Complication and mortality rates peaked in 1998 (11.7% and 1%) and progressively decreased to 1.4% and 0.04% in 2016. Utilization increased from 0.07% in 1993 to 0.62% in 2004 and remained low at 0.5% in 2016.Perioperative safety of bariatric surgery improved over the last quarter-century.

Identification of causative mutations provides an important insight into common pathogenic mechanisms that cause both seizures and abnormal motor control. We report bi-allelic loss-of-function CACNA1B variants in six children from three unrelated families whose affected members present with a complex and progressive neurological syndrome. All affected individuals presented with epileptic encephalopathy, severe neurodevelopmental delay (often with regression), and a hyperkinetic movement disorder. Additional neurological features included postnatal microcephaly and hypotonia. Five children died in childhood or adolescence (mean age of death: 9 years), mainly as a result of secondary respiratory complications. CACNA1B encodes the pore-forming subunit of the pre-synaptic neuronal voltage-gated calcium channel Ca./N-type, crucial for SNARE-mediated neurotransmission, particularly in the early postnatal period. Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in CACNA1B are predicted to cause disruption of Ca influx, leading to impaired synaptic neurotransmission. The resultant effect on neuronal function is likely to be important in the development of involuntary movements and epilepsy. Overall, our findings provide further evidence for the key role of Ca. in normal human neurodevelopment.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

Telmisartan-treated conditioned medium (Tel-CM) of RAW264.7 cells and of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) induced the expressions of  markers in fully differentiated white adipocytes with reduced lipid droplets, and increased oxygen consumption rate and mitochondrial biogenesis. Levels of catecholamines (CA) released into the conditioned medium as well as intracellular tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNAs were found to be increased by telmisartan, and  effects of Tel-CM were lessened by β3 receptor antagonist (L-748,337), suggesting CA secreted into CM play a role in Tel-CM-induced adipocyte . Acute administration of telmisartan ( weeks, p.o.) to C57BL/6J mice increased the expressions of  markers and M2 markers in white adipose tissues, whereas macrophage depletion by clodronate liposome pretreatment attenuated the telmisartan-induced expressions of  markers. Together, telmisartan was observed to induce the  of fully differentiated white adipocytes, at least in part, via PPAR activation-mediated M2 polarization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163436>Intravitreal Aflibercept for Retinal Angiomatous Proliferation: Results of a Prospective Case Series at 96 Weeks.</a></h1><p>Retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) is a subtype of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Untreated, the lesions are thought to be aggressive and lead to a poor visual outcome. Despite some limitations, studies reporting the treatment of RAP lesions with the intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs ranibizumab and bevacizumab have demonstrated variable but generally favourable responses. More recently, aflibercept has been licensed for the treatment of nAMD and may offer some advantages over other agents. We present the visual and anatomical outcomes at 96 weeks of patients with RAP lesions who were treated with intravitreal aflibercept, according to the pivotal VIEW study nAMD treatment protocol.This is a prospective study of treatment-naïve patients with Reading Centre-graded RAP lesions. The patients received aflibercept every 8 weeks, after 3 initial monthly injections, up to and including week 48. During weeks 52-96, patients received injections at least every 12 weeks, with monthly evaluations for interim injections if they fulfilled the retreatment criteria. At each visit, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) central macular thickness (CMT) were measured.Forty-six patients reached study completion at week 96. Mean BCVA had improved by 6.0 (standard deviation [SD] 7.9) and 4.8 (SD 7.4) ETDRS letters at 52 (p = 0.003) and 96 (p = 0.02) weeks, respectively, from a baseline of 57.3 (SD 12.0) letters. At 52- and 96-week time points, 45/46 (98%) and 41/46 (89%) of patients, respectively, had maintained their vision (<15 letters of BCVA lost). At the 96-week time point, 13/46 (28%) of patients had gained ≥15 letters and also demonstrated a mean reduction in CMT of 162 μm (SD 106) (p = <0.0001), with 72% of maculae being fluid-free. Using univariate analysis, we found no significant difference between any of the visual outcome measures in this study and the pivotal VIEW study; the mean number of injections required and change in CMT were also similar.In this study, we present the 96-week results, of the largest series to date, of patients treated prospectively with aflibercept for RAP using the VIEW protocol. We show that they benefited from treatment to a degree similar to those with type 1 and  nAMD.© 2019 S.

Hair cortisol may be a useful biomarker as it is a retrospective and longer-term measure of the mean cortisol level. However, studies have yet to examine the relationships between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms in samples of youth, and findings with adult samples are mixed. This study examined hair cortisol as a predictor of depressive symptoms, including the potential for nonlinear relationships.A representative community sample of 432 adolescents aged 11 to 17 years was examined. Depressive symptoms were measured using a 9-item short-form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale. Hair was cut from the posterior vertex region of the scalp using thinning shears. Hair was washed, minced, ground and assayed with Salimetrics® Cortisol Enzyme Immunoassay Kit. Hair cortisol levels were logged for statistical analysis.In multivariable regression analysis, no significant linear relationship was found in model 1 between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms (b= -0.036, se = 0.02, p = 0.13). In model , a marginally significant linear association (b= -0.044, se = 0.02, p-value = 0.06) and a significant curvilinear relationship (b = 0.039, se = 0.01, p-value = 0.005) were found between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms. The results were graphed depicting a u-shaped curve such that hair cortisol levels on the lower and higher end of the distribution predicted depressive symptoms.The findings highlight the need to consider investigation of nonlinear associations between cortisol and depressive symptoms. Longitudinal mechanistic research is needed to elucidate the causal relationships between hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation and depressive symptoms as well as a better understanding of the biological mechanisms through which cortisol may contribute to depressive symptoms and psychopathology.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Challenges include developing standardized imaging protocols, ensuring consistent application by technologists, and monitoring quality. These challenges increase as enterprises grow in geographical extent and complexity through mergers or partnerships. Our imaging enterprise includes a university hospital and clinic system, a large county hospital and healthcare system, and a pediatric hospital and health system. Studies across the three systems are interpreted by one large academic radiology group with expertise in various subspecialties. Our goals were as follows: (1) Standardize imaging protocols; () adapt the imaging protocols to specific modalities and available equipment; and (3) disseminate this knowledge across all of the sites of care. Our approach involved three components: (1) facilitation of imaging protocol definition across subspecialty radiologist teams; () creation of a database which links the clinical imaging protocols to the scanner/machine specific acquisition protocols; and (3) delivery of a protocol library and updates to all users regardless of location. We successfully instituted a process for the development, implementation, and delivery of standardized imaging protocols in a complex, multi-institutional healthcare system. Key elements for success include (1) a Project Champion who is able to articulate the importance of protocol standardization in improving the quality of patient care, () strong, effective modality-specific operational committees, (3) a Project Lead to manage the process efficiently, and (4) an electronic publishing of the protocol database to facilitate ease of access and use.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30746288>DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY OF THE LEVER SIGN IN DETECTING ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT TEARS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS.</a></h1><p>The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most commonly injured ligaments in the knee. With the prevalence of ACL tears increasing, there is a growing need for clinical tests to rule in and rule out a suspected tear. A new clinical test for detecting ACL tears has been introduced with preliminary studies showing promising results.To systematically review and analyze information from the current literature on the diagnostic accuracy of the Lever Sign test for the use of diagnosing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in a clinical setting.Systematic review and meta-analysis.A computerized search of PubMed, Cinahl, Scopus, and Proquest databases as well as a hand-search was completed on all available literature using keywords relating to the diagnostic accuracy of the Lever Sign Test. A quality assessment was performed on each article included in this review utilizing the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS).Eight articles were included, with only three studies exhibiting high quality, however the study samples were heterogenous. Included studies indicated that the Lever Sign test is both sensitive and specific in diagnosing ACL tears. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.77 and 0.90, respectively. The negative likelihood ratio is 0.22 and the positive likelihood ratio is 6.60.The Lever Sign test is comparable to other clinical tests used in current practice to detect an ACL rupture. The pooled data from current available literature on the Lever Sign indicate that a positive or negative test should result in a moderate shift in post-test probability. This test may be used in addition to other tests to rule in and rule out the presence of an ACL rupture.2a- Systematic Review of Level  diagnostic studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30930854>Ginsenoside Rb2 Alleviates Obesity by Activation of Brown Fat and Induction of  of White Fat.</a></h1><p>Ginsenoside Rb2 (Rb2), the most abundant saponin contained in Panax ginseng, has been used to treat variety of metabolic diseases. However, its effects in obesity and potential mechanisms are not well-understood. In the present study, we investigated metabolic performance with a Rb2 supplement in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, focusing on the effects and mechanisms of Rb2 on brown and beige fat functions. Our results demonstrated that Rb2 effectively reduced body weight, improved insulin sensitivity, as well as induced energy expenditure in DIO mice. Histological and gene analysis revealed that Rb2 induced activation of brown fat and  of white fat by reducing lipid droplets, stimulating uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) staining, and increasing expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial genes, which could be recapitulated in 3T3-L1, C3H10T1/, and primary adipocytes. In addition, Rb2 induced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) both  and . These effects were shown to be dependent on AMPK since its inhibitor blocked Rb2 from inducing expressions of Pgc1α and Ucp1. Overall, the present study revealed that Rb2 activated brown fat and induced  of white fat, which increased energy expenditure and thermogenesis, and consequently ameliorated obesity and metabolic disorders. These suggest that Rb2 holds promise in treating obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30904501>Ultrasound-activated microbubbles as a novel intracellular drug delivery system for urinary tract infection.</a></h1><p>The development of new modalities for high-efficiency intracellular drug delivery is a priority for a number of disease areas. One such area is urinary tract infection (UTI), which is one of the most common infectious diseases globally and which imposes an immense economic and healthcare burden. Common uropathogenic bacteria have been shown to invade the urothelial wall during acute UTI, forming latent intracellular reservoirs that can evade antimicrobials and the immune response. This behaviour likely facilitates the high recurrence rates after oral antibiotic treatments, which are not able to penetrate the bladder wall and accumulate to an effective concentration. Meanwhile, oral antibiotics may also exacerbate antimicrobial resistance and cause systemic side effects. Using a human urothelial organoid model, we tested the ability of novel ultrasound-activated lipid microbubbles to deliver drugs into the cytoplasm of apical cells. The gas-filled lipid microbubbles were decorated with liposomes containing the non-cell-permeant antibiotic gentamicin and a fluorescent marker. The microbubble suspension was added to buffer at the apical surface of the bladder model before being exposed to ultrasound (1.1 MHz, .5 Mpa, 5500 cycles at 20 ms pulse duration) for 20 s. Our results show that ultrasound-activated intracellular delivery using microbubbles was over 16 times greater than the control group and twice that achieved by liposomes that were not associated with microbubbles. Moreover, no cell damage was detected. Together, our data show that ultrasound-activated microbubbles can safely deliver high concentrations of drugs into urothelial cells, and have the potential to be a more efficacious alternative to traditional oral antibiotic regimes for UTI. This modality of intracellular drug delivery may prove useful in other clinical indications, such as cancer and gene therapy, where such penetration would aid in treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We estimated the annual UK incidence from primary care (PC), emergency attendances (EA), hospital admissions (HA) and deaths.The population was children (0-15 years), across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (NI), with medically attended burns 2013-2015. Routinely collected data sources included PC attendances from Clinical Practice Research Datalink 2013-2015), EAs from Paediatric Emergency Research in the United Kingdom and Ireland (PERUKI, 2014) and National Health Services Wales Informatics Services, HAs from Hospital Episode Statistics, National Services Scotland and Social Services and Public Safety (2014), and mortality from the Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland and NI Statistics and Research Agency 2013-2015. The population denominators were based on Office for National Statistics mid-year population estimates.The annual PC burns attendance was 16.1/10 000 persons at risk (95% CI 15.6 to 16.6); EAs were 35.1/10 000 persons at risk (95% CI 34.7 to 35.5) in England and 28.9 (95% CI 27.5 to 30.3) in Wales. HAs ranged from 6.0/10 000 person at risk (95% CI 5.9 to 6.) in England to 3.1 in Wales and Scotland (95% CI .7 to 3.8 and .7 to 3.5, respectively) and .8 (95% CI .4 to 3.4) in NI.

All required chest compressions for greater than or equal to  minutes, were comatose and required mechanical ventilation after return of circulation.Neurobehavioral function was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition at baseline (reflecting precardiac arrest status), and at 3 and 12 months postcardiac arrest, followed by on-site cognitive evaluation. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition norms are 100 (mean) ± 15 (SD); higher scores indicate better function.

In late August, CDC released recommendations for health care providers regarding e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) based on limited data from the first reported cases (1,). This report summarizes national surveillance data describing clinical features of more recently reported cases and interim recommendations based on these data for U.S. health care providers caring for patients with suspected or known EVALI. It provides interim guidance for 1) initial clinical evaluation; ) suggested criteria for hospital admission and treatment; 3) patient follow-up; 4) special considerations for groups at high risk; and 5) clinical and public health recommendations. Health care providers evaluating patients suspected to have EVALI should ask about the use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products in a nonjudgmental and thorough manner. Patients suspected to have EVALI should have a chest radiograph (CXR), and hospital admission is recommended for patients who have decreased blood oxygen (O) saturation (<95%) on room air or who are in respiratory distress. Health care providers should consider empiric use of a combination of antibiotics, antivirals, or steroids based upon clinical context. Evidence-based tobacco product cessation strategies, including behavioral counseling, are recommended to help patients discontinue use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients who have been treated for EVALI should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products. CDC recommends that persons should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). At present, CDC recommends persons consider refraining from using e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain nicotine. Irrespective of the ongoing investigation, e-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths, young adults, or women who are pregnant. Persons who do not currently use tobacco products should not start using e-cigarette, or vaping, products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30884843>Ursodeoxycholic Acid Regulates Hepatic Energy Homeostasis and White Adipose Tissue Macrophages Polarization in Leptin-Deficiency Obese Mice.</a></h1><p>Obesity has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of several forms of metabolic syndrome, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type  diabetes. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and prevents mitochondrial dysfunction in the progression of obesity-associated diseases. The aim of the study was to evaluate the mechanisms of UDCA during obesity-linked hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and obesity-associated adipose tissue macrophage-induced inflammation in obese mice. UDCA significantly decreased lipid droplets, reduced free fatty acids (FFA) and triglycerides (TG), improved mitochondrial function, and enhanced white adipose tissue  in  mice. This is associated with increased hepatic energy expenditure, mitochondria biogenesis, and incorporation of bile acid metabolism (Abca1, Abcg1 mRNA and BSEP, FGFR4, and TGR5 protein). In addition, UDCA downregulated NF-κB and STAT3 phosphorylation by negative regulation of the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 signaling. These changes were accompanied by decreased angiogenesis, as shown by the downregulation of VEGF, VCAM, and TGF-βRII expression. Importantly, UDCA is equally effective in reducing whole body adiposity. This is associated with decreased adipose tissue expression of macrophage infiltration (CD11b, CD163, and CD206) and lipogenic capacity markers (lipofuscin, SREBP-1, and CD36). Furthermore, UDCA significantly upregulated adipose  in association with upregulation of SIRT-1-PGC1-α signaling in epididymis adipose tissue (EWAT). These results suggest that multi-targeted therapies modulate glucose and lipid biosynthesis fluxes, inflammatory response, angiogenesis, and macrophage differentiation. Therefore, it may be suggested that UDCA treatment may be a novel therapeutic agent for obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089549>Quercetin Upregulates Uncoupling Protein 1 in White/Brown Adipose Tissues through Sympathetic Stimulation.</a></h1><p>Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) plays an important role in increasing energy expenditure; thus, it is being considered as a new target for preventing obesity and metabolic complications. In this study, we investigated the effect of quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, on UCP1 expression in white/brown adipose tissues (WAT/BAT).Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with or without dietary quercetin for 9 weeks, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with quercetin. Expression of UCP1 and other thermogenic genes/proteins was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and/or Western blotting.Dietary quercetin supplementation increased the level of UCP1 in both WAT and/or BAT of HFD-fed obese mice, which was accompanied by upregulated mRNA levels of thermogenesis-related genes. Quercetin supplementation enhanced the plasma norepinephrine level and tended to upregulate  mRNA level in the WAT of HFD-fed obese mice, accompanied by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Moreover, quercetin enhanced UCP1 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and this was blunted by treatment with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist.These findings suggest that quercetin upregulates UCP1, implying increased WAT  and BAT activity, via activation of the AMPK/PPARγ pathway through sympathetic stimulation. Quercetin may be useful for preventing obesity and metabolic complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30733616>Molecular pathways linking adipose innervation to insulin action in obesity and diabetes mellitus.</a></h1><p>Adipose tissue comprises adipocytes and many other cell types that engage in dynamic crosstalk in a highly innervated and vascularized tissue matrix. Although adipose tissue has been studied for decades, it has been appreciated only in the past 5 years that extensive arborization of nerve fibres has a dominant role in regulating the function of adipose tissue. This Review summarizes the latest literature, which suggests that adipocytes signal to local sensory nerve fibres in response to perturbations in lipolysis and lipogenesis. Such adipocyte signalling to the central nervous system causes sympathetic output to distant adipose depots and potentially other metabolic tissues to regulate systemic glucose homeostasis. Paracrine factors identified in the past few years that mediate such adipocyte-neuron crosstalk are also reviewed. Similarly, immune cells and endothelial cells within adipose tissue communicate with local nerve fibres to modulate neurotransmitter tone, blood flow, adipocyte differentiation and energy expenditure, including adipose  to produce heat. This understudied field of neurometabolism related to adipose tissue biology has great potential to reveal new mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic strategies for obesity and type  diabetes mellitus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344959>Phlorotannins with Potential Anti-tyrosinase and Antioxidant Activity Isolated from the Marine Seaweed .</a></h1><p>Compounds were isolated from  Okamura, a marine brown alga widely consumed as food.

Molecular docking simulations clarified that the hydroxyl residues of the isolated compounds formed hydrogen bonds with residues at the catalytic and allosteric sites of tyrosinase, while other residues participated in hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, 974-A, phlorofucofuroeckol-A and eckol reduced the cellular melanin content and tyrosinase activity, and downregulated the expression of melanogenesis enzymes including tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP- in B16F10 melanoma cells.

Results of .5 Years Follow-Up of Drug-Free Cohort Vulnerable for Recurrence.</a></h1><p>An interesting factor explaining recurrence risk in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) may be neuropsychological functioning, i.e., processing of emotional stimuli/information. Negatively biased processing of emotional stimuli/information has been found in both acute and (inconclusively) remitted states of MDD, and may be causally related to recurrence of depression. We aimed to investigate self-referent, memory and interpretation biases in recurrently depressed patients in remission and relate these biases to recurrence. We included 69 remitted recurrent MDD-patients (rrMDD-patients), 35-65 years, with ≥ episodes, voluntarily free of antidepressant maintenance therapy for at least 4 weeks. We tested self-referent biases with an emotional categorization task, bias in emotional memory by free recall of the emotion categorization task 15 min after completing it, and interpretation bias with a facial expression recognition task. We compared these participants with 43 never-depressed controls matched for age, sex and intelligence. We followed the rrMDD-patients for .5 years and assessed recurrent depressive episodes by structured interview. The rrMDD-patients showed biases toward emotionally negative stimuli, faster responses to negative self-relevant characteristics in the emotional categorization, better recognition of sad faces, worse recognition of neutral faces with more misclassifications as angry or disgusting faces and less misclassifications as neutral faces (0.001 <  < 0.05). Of these, the number of misclassifications as angry and the overall performance in the emotional memory task were significantly associated with the time to recurrence ( ≤ 0.04), independent of residual symptoms and number of previous episodes. In a support vector machine data-driven model, prediction of recurrence-status could best be achieved (relative to observed recurrence-rate) with demographic and childhood adversity parameters (accuracy 78.1%; 1-sided  = 0.002); neuropsychological tests could not improve this prediction. Our data suggests a persisting (mood-incongruent) emotional bias when patients with recurrent depression are in remission. Moreover, these persisting biases might be mechanistically important for recurrence and prevention thereof.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018035>Cocoa Shell Aqueous Phenolic Extract Preserves Mitochondrial Function and Insulin Sensitivity by Attenuating Inflammation between Macrophages and Adipocytes In Vitro.</a></h1><p>The aim is to assess the action of an aqueous extract from cocoa shell (CAE) and its main phenolic compounds to prevent the loss of obesity-induced mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity, targeting inflammation between macrophages-adipocytes in vitro.CAE (31-500 µg mL ) inhibits 3T3-L1 adipocytes lipid accumulation and induces  during differentiation. LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages show reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase- expression and lowered pro-inflammatory cytokine production when treated with CAE and pure phenolics. Inflammatory crosstalk created by stimulating adipocytes with macrophage-conditioned media (CM) is arrested; CAE diminishes tumor necrosis factor-α (67%) and promotes adiponectin secretion (12.3-fold). Mitochondrial function, measured by reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial content, and activity, is preserved in CM-treated adipocytes through up-regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α expression. Increases in insulin receptor (9-fold), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (3-fold), protein kinase B (4-fold) phosphorylation, and a decrease in insulin receptor substrate 1 serine phosphorylation induce increased glucose uptake (34%) and glucose transporter 4 translocation (14-fold) in CM-induced adipocytes.CAE phenolics promote a beige phenotype in adipocytes. Macrophages-adipocytes inflammatory interaction is reduced preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance.

In this study, it was found that intraperitoneal treatment of mice with taurine alleviated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, improved insulin sensitivity, and increased energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis of the mice. Meanwhile, administration of the mice with taurine markedly induced the  of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) with significantly elevated expression of PGC1α, UCP1, and other thermogenic genes in iWAT.  studies indicated that taurine also induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in C3H10T1/ white adipocytes. Knockdown of PGC1α blunted the role of taurine in promoting the brown-like adipocyte phenotypes in C3H10T1/ cells. Moreover, taurine treatment enhanced AMPK phosphorylation  and , and knockdown of AMPKα1 prevented taurine-mediated induction of PGC1α in C3H10T1/ cells. Consistently, specific knockdown of PGC1α in iWAT of the HFD-fed mice inhibited taurine-induced  of iWAT, with the role of taurine in the enhancement of adaptive thermogenesis, the prevention of obesity, and the improvement of insulin sensitivity being partially impaired. These results reveal a functional role of taurine in facilitating the  of white adipose tissue, which depends on the induction of PGC1α. Our studies also suggest a potential mechanism for the protective role of taurine against obesity, which involves taurine-mediated  of white adipose tissue.© 2019 Guo et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507080>Signal regulatory protein alpha initiates cachexia through muscle to adipose tissue crosstalk.</a></h1><p>Muscle wasting from chronic kidney disease (CKD) or from defective insulin signalling results in morbidity and, ultimately, mortality. We have identified an endogenous mediator of insulin resistance, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα), which leads to cachexia in mice and is associated with cachexia in patients with CKD.We assessed insulin signalling and mechanisms causing muscle atrophy plus white adipose tissue (WAT) metabolism in mouse models of CKD or acute diabetes (streptozotocin treatment). We then examined these factors in mice with global knockout (KO) of SIRPα and sought mediators of metabolic responses in muscle and adipose tissues of mice with either muscle-specific or adipose tissue-specific KO of SIRPα. Metabolic responses were confirmed in primary cultures of adipose cells.In mice with CKD, SIRPα expression was increased in WAT (three-fold, P < 0.05), and this was associated with precursors of cachexia: 'pathologic ', thermogenesis, and a two-fold activation of protein kinase A (P < 0.05 vs. control mice) plus loss of adipose tissue mass. In contrast, mice with SIRPα global KO and CKD or acute diabetes experienced improved insulin signalling and activation of pAkt plus 'physiologic ' of WAT. These mice avoided losses of muscle and adipose tissues and experienced a 31% improvement in survival (P < 0.05) than did wild-type mice with CKD. In muscle-specific SIRPα KO mice with CKD, we uncovered that serum SIRPα levels (P < 0.05) were suppressed and were associated with improved insulin signalling both in skeletal muscles and in WAT. These changes were accompanied by physiologic WAT . However, in adipose-specific SIRPα KO mice with CKD, levels of serum SIRPα were increased over two-fold (P < 0.05), while muscle losses were minimally inhibited. Clinical implications of SIRPα signalling are suggested by our findings that include increased SIRPα expression in muscle and adipose tissues (P < 0.05 vs. healthy controls) plus higher SIRPα levels in the serum of patients with CKD (.4-fold, P=0.000017 vs. healthy controls).Our results show that SIRPα plays an important role as an anti-insulin mediator regulating pathways to cachexia. In muscle-specific SIRPα KO, changes in SIRPα serum levels seem to improve insulin signalling in muscle and WAT, suggesting crosstalk between muscle and adipose tissue. Therefore, targeting SIRPα may prevent cachexia in patients with CKD or acute diabetes.© 2019 The Authors.

Based on the recent finding that casein kinase- (CK2) acts as a negative regulator of , new CK2 inhibitors were investigated as potential  agents. This led to the identification of clomiphene as a candidate. Clomiphene was found to inhibit CK2 activity with an IC of .39 μM. Accordingly, clomiphene increased mRNA and protein expression of  markers, including uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes and in murine primary adipocytes. In agreement with the increased expression of  markers, reduced lipid droplets, increased oxygen consumption rates, and mitochondrial biogenesis were detected after clomiphene treatment. Furthermore, phosphorylation of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and , downstream mediators of CK2 actions, was decreased by clomiphene. On the other hand, CK2 overexpression diminished clomiphene-induced mitochondrial biogenesis as well as expression of  markers, suggesting that clomiphene-induced  is related to its inhibition of CK2. In vivo administration of clomiphene increased the mRNA expression of  markers in various adipose tissues, accompanied by reduced fat weights and body weights in mice. In summary, these data suggested that clomiphene induced the  of white adipocytes via CK2 inhibition, which may implicate it as a new anti-obesity drug.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The changes in the compositions and contents of the primary polyphenolic compounds were investigated during the first few hours of storage and then after 1, , 3, and 6 days of storage at 6°C and revealed sharp variations.  development, activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, and concentration of ascorbic acid were also examined during storage. The content of chicoric acid, which was the most abundant phenolic compound, varied substantially during the first 24 hr of storage and between the different varieties. Oak leaf lettuce, which was the most sensitive variety to , was characterized by a higher maintained chicoric acid level with a constant decreased chlorogenic acid level during the storage period. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:  development is responsible for the short shelf life of minimally processed vegetables, such as lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Polyphenolic compounds, as substrates of enzymatic reactions, are involved in the  susceptibility of leaves. Comparisons of the profiles and contents of these compounds in different leaves showed dramatic variations during storage.

It is well established that the NAC transcription factor and salicylic acid (SA) signal pathway play essential roles in response to biotic stresses. However, simultaneous silencing of two target genes using VIGS in plants has been rarely reported. Therefore, in this report, we performed VIGS to silence simultaneously the SA-binding protein  (NbSABP2) and NbNAC1 in Nicotiana benthamiana to investigate the gene silencing efficiency of simultaneous silencing of two genes. We first cloned the full-length NbNAC1 gene, and the characterization of NbNAC1 was also analysed. Overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that the combination of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 was successfully amplified. Bacteria liquid PCR confirmed that the combination of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 was successfully inserted into the tobacco rattle virus vector. The results showed that the leaves from the NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 gene-silenced plants collapsed slightly, with  at the base of petiole or veina. Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the expression of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 were significantly reduced in 12 days post silenced plants after tobacco rattle virus infiltration compared with the control plants.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mediates production of heat while white adipose tissue (WAT) function in the storage of fat. Roles of BAT in the treatment of obesity and related disorders warrants more investigation. Peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) is the master regulator of both BAT and WAT adipogenesis and has roles in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Adipose tissue is the major expression site for PPAR-γ. In this study, the effects of rosiglitazone on the brown adipogenesis and the association of MAPK and PI3K pathways was investigated during the in vitro adipogenic differentiation of telomerase transformed mesenchymal stromal cells (iMSCs). Our data indicate that  µM rosiglitazone enhanced adipogenesis by over-expression of PPAR-γ and C/EBP-α. More specifically, brown adipogenesis was enhanced by the upregulation of EBF2 and UCP-1 and evidenced by multilocular fatty droplets morphology of the differentiated adipocytes. We also found that rosiglitazone significantly activated MAPK and PI3K pathways at the maturation stage of differentiation. Overall, the results indicate that rosiglitazone induced overexpression of PPAR-γ that in turn enhanced adipogenesis, particularly  adipogenesis. This study reports the  effects of rosiglitazone during the differentiation of iMSCs into adipocytes in association with the activation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678856>Adipocyte Mineralocorticoid Receptor.</a></h1><p>Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) has been recently identified in adipose tissue, where its excessive activation contributes to several metabolic derangements often observed in obesity and metabolic syndrome. Recent findings support the existence of a bidirectional cross-talk between adipose tissue and adrenal glands, contributing to obesity-related hyperaldosteronism and subsequent adipocyte MR excessive activation. In this regard, MR pharmacological blockade has led to prevention of weight gain and metabolic benefits in murine models of genetic or diet-induced obesity. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the potential metabolic effects of MR antagonists in clinical settings.

Population densities were 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 plants m . After being harvested at 300, 360, or 420 days after planting, cassava were minimally processed and stored at 5 ± °C. It was observed that superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) play key roles in the tolerance of young roots to . Planting density, however, does not appear to be a key factor modulating the activity of the enzymes studied. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Younger harvested cassava roots, harvested at 300 days, are more tolerant to enzymatic . This appears to be in part due to enzymatic activity modulation of the SOD, CAT, and POD enzymes. In addition, it has been demonstrated that agronomic techniques aimed at increasing productivity, such as increasing the planting density of cassava, do not alter the biomarkers of postharvest quality. In summary, evidence that field management may be an efficient approach to improving the conservation of minimally processed cassava is provided. We believe that the findings of this paper will be of great interest regarding the influence of field management on the postharvest quality of freshly cut cassava and will also provide applicable results relating to its production chain.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477174>Antioxidant-upregulated mesenchymal stem cells reduce inflammation and improve fatty liver disease in diet-induced obesity.</a></h1><p>The incidence of obesity and diabetes is increasing rapidly. Optimal management is still elusive. Obesity associated with type  diabetes is known to cause adipose tissue inflammation, increase oxidative stress, and cause white fat hyperplasia and mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we investigated whether mitochondrial and cytosolic antioxidant-upregulated mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) delivery reduces oxidative stress and subsequently improves glucose tolerance, reduce systemic inflammation, and improves fatty liver disease in diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse models.Antioxidant genes Sod2 (mitochondrial) and catalase (cytosolic) or null (control) were upregulated in human adipose tissue-derived MSCs using adenoviral constructs. Modified MSCs were then delivered intraperitoneally into mice that were fed a 45% or 60% high-fat diet (HFD), and animals were followed for 4 weeks.Over 4 weeks, body weight remained stable; however, we noted a significant reduction in liver fat content by histological analysis and liver triglyceride assay. Triglyceride assay (p < 0.01) confirmed reduced liver fat accumulation in animals that received either Sod2- or Cat-MSCs. There was a lower plasma level of inflammatory marker TNFα, measured in mice that were fed either 45% or 60% HFD and received Sod2- or Cat-MSCs, indicating reduced systemic inflammation. Ucp1 mRNA was upregulated approximately 100-1000-fold for omental fat and 10-100-fold for pericardial fat compared to the Null-MSC-receiving group. Pcgc1a and Prdm16 mRNA upregulation was also noted particularly for pericardial fat. Glucose tolerance showed a positive improvement trend with a lower area under the curve (AUC) values for both Sod2- and Cat-MSCs groups in comparison to control. For mice fed with 60% HFD and that received Sod2-MSCs, glucose levels were significantly lower than control (*p < 0.05) at a time point of 60 min in the glycemic curve during glucose tolerance test.Reduction of oxidative stress post-antioxidant-upregulated MSC delivery, intraperitoneally, reduces systemic inflammation and fat accumulation in the liver. There is evidence of an increase in  of white adipose tissue depots with concomitant improvement of glucose tolerance in a weight-independent fashion. Antioxidant-upregulated MSC delivery may be a safe yet effective therapy for obesity and prediabetes and improves related complication such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501343>Distinct intraspecies virulence mechanisms regulated by a conserved transcription factor.</a></h1><p>Tailoring transcriptional regulation to coordinate the expression of virulence factors in tandem with the core genome is a hallmark of bacterial pathogen evolution. Bacteria encode hundreds of transcription factors forming the base-level control of gene regulation. Moreover, highly homologous regulators are assumed to control conserved genes between members within a species that harbor the same genetic targets. We have explored this concept in   pathotypes that employ distinct virulence mechanisms that facilitate specification of a different niche within the host. Strikingly, we found that the transcription factor YhaJ actively regulated unique gene sets between intestinal enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) and extraintestinal uropathogenic  (UPEC), despite being very highly conserved. In EHEC, YhaJ directly activates expression of type 3 secretion system components and effectors. Alternatively, YhaJ enhances UPEC virulence regulation by binding directly to the phase-variable type 1 fimbria promoter, driving its expression. Additionally, YhaJ was found to override the universal GAD acid tolerance system but exclusively in EHEC, thereby indirectly enhancing type 3 secretion pleiotropically. These results have revealed that within a species, conserved regulators are actively repurposed in a "personalized" manner to benefit particular lifestyles and drive virulence via multiple distinct mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Examples from the literature show that processed potato- and cereal-based products are two major food types that seem to contribute the highest amounts of acrylamide to the diet worldwide. To meet both the demand for gluten-free products and the interest in alternative grains, we previously developed recipes for flatbreads using a variety of different grains. In this study, we determined the acrylamide content of 15 experimental flatbreads made from a variety of flours and 21 commercial flatbreads. The application of a validated, highly sensitive HPLC/MS method revealed that flatbreads made with the following flours baked at 195.5 °C for  min had very low (<10 μg/kg) levels of acrylamide: brown rice, buckwheat, cornmeal, millet, oat, and quinoa. The acrylamide levels of the following flatbreads were 14 to 59 μg/kg: rye, sorghum, soy, wheat, commercial pita, pita crackers, pizza, naan, and lavash. Wheat-based matzo breads, which are rapidly baked to a crisp texture at high heat (∼400 °C), contained 101 to 504 μg/kg acrylamide. Potato-based products were some of the highest of the products tested, ranging from 153 (potato pancakes) to ,070 (potato-containing gluten-free matzos) μg/kg acrylamide. Except for the potato-containing products, the flatbreads made in this study were lower in acrylamide content (<3 to 21.3 μg/kg) than any of the commercial products tested. Of these experimental flatbreads, wheat- and sorghum-based products were the highest. Flatbreads from alternative grains can result in gluten-free products with high nutritional value and less acrylamide. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Acrylamide formation is dependent on both the composition of the food product and the method of cooking. Flatbreads have the potential to be high in acrylamide due to cooking methods which lead to the development of desirable  products. Flatbreads developed in this study using alternative and ancient grains were mostly lower in acrylamide content than their wheat counterpart, suggesting that they can serve as a low-acrylamide, gluten-free functional food.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443159>Transcriptional Response of Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue to Acute Cold Exposure in Mice.</a></h1><p>Beige adipose tissue has been considered to have potential applications in combating obesity and its related metabolic diseases. However, the mechanisms of acute cold-stimulated beige formation still remain largely unknown. Here, transcriptional analysis of acute cold-stimulated (4 °C for 4 h) subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) was conducted to determine the molecular signatures that might be involved in beige formation. Histological analysis confirmed the appearance of beige adipocytes in acute cold-treated sWAT.

The objective of this study was to evaluate protective effects of fermented  extract by  ON188 (ONE) against hepatosteatosis and obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed HFD mixed with ONE for four weeks and its effects on hepatosteatosis and obesity were examined. Although ONE did not change food intake, it reduced body weights of mice at administration dose of 200 mg/kg/day. Activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) as plasma parameters were reduced by ONE in a dose-dependent manner. Hepatic lipid droplets and triglyceride (TG) levels were also reduced by ONE due to upregulation of fatty acid oxidizing genes such as carnithine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) and peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor α(PPARα) mediated by induction of sphingosine kinase  (SPHK2). In epididymal fat tissue, sizes of adipocytes were significantly reduced by ONE in a dose-dependent manner. This is mainly due to suppression of lipogenesis and upregulation of adipocyte  genes. Collectively, these results suggest that fermented ONE can activate fatty acid oxidation via SPHK2 in the liver. It can also suppress lipogenesis and activate  in adipose tissue. Thus, ONE might have potential to be used for the development of functional foods against liver dysfunction and obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309828>Interaction of Added l-Cysteine with -Threityl-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic Acid Derived from the Xylose-Cysteine System Affecting Its Maillard .</a></h1><p>The Maillard reaction under a stepwise increase of temperature using l-cysteine as the indicator was performed to determine the formation conditions for the preparation of -threityl-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (TTCA) which was the main Maillard reaction intermediate (MRI) derived from the xylose (Xyl)-cysteine (Cys) model system in aqueous medium.

We demonstrate that these beneficial metabolic effects are due to enhanced signaling through adipocyte β3-adrenergic receptors (β3-ARs), indicating that barr2 represents a potent negative regulator of adipocyte β3-AR activity in vivo. Interestingly, essentially all beneficial metabolic effects caused by adipocyte barr2 deficiency are absent in adipocyte barr2-PRDM16 double KO mice, indicating that the metabolic improvements caused by the lack of barr2 in adipocytes are mediated by the /beiging of white adipose tissue.

This is the situation with the population of the island of Crete, which remained relatively undisturbed until the Middle Ages when multiple wars, invasions, and occupations by foreigners took place. Historians have considered the effects of the occupation of Crete by the Arabs (in the 9th and 10th centuries C.E.) and the Venetians (in the 13th to the 17th centuries C.E.) to the local population. To obtain insights on such effects from a genetic perspective, we studied representative samples from 17 Cretan districts using the Illumina 1 million or .5 million arrays and compared the Cretans to the populations of origin of the medieval conquerors and settlers. Highlights of our findings include (1) small genetic contributions from the Arab occupation to the extant Cretan population, () low genetic contribution of the Venetians to the extant Cretan population, and (3) evidence of a genetic relationship among the Cretans and Central, Northern, and Eastern Europeans, which could be explained by the settlement in the island of northern origin tribes during the medieval period. Our results show how the interaction between genetics and the historical record can help shed light on the historical record.© 2019 The Authors.

Identifying and understanding the mechanism of inhibition of polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) in lentil sprouts may offer inexpensive alternatives to prevent . This study focused on the biochemical characteristics of PPOs from stored lentil sprouts, providing data that may be directly implemented in improving the consumer quality of sprouts. The purification resulted in approximately 25-fold enrichment of two PPO isoenzymes (PPO I and PPO II). The optimum pH for total PPOs, as well as for PPO I and PPO II isoenzymes, was 4.5-5.5, 4.5-5.0, and 5.5, respectively. The optimal temperature for PPOs was 35 °C. Total PPOs and the PPO I and PPO II isoenzymes had the greatest affinity for catechol ( = 1.32, 1.76, and 0.94 mM, respectively). Ascorbic acid was the most effective in the inhibition of dark color formation by total PPOs, and showed ca. 62%, 43%, and 24% inhibition at 20-, -, and 0.-mM concentrations. Ascorbic acid, l-cysteine, and sodium metabisulfite (20 mM) significantly inhibited color development in the reactions catalyzed by both isoenzymes of PPO. Ba, Fe, and Mn (10 mM) completely inhibited PPO activity. This study of the effect of antibrowning compounds and cations on PPO activity provides data that can be used to protect lentil sprouts against enzymatic  during storage and processing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955672>Nutritional, phytochemical, functional and sensorial attributes of Syzygium cumini L. pulp incorporated pasta.</a></h1><p>Nutritional, phytochemical and antioxidant potential of wheat pasta was enhanced by incorporation of S. cumini pulp (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40%).

However, it is unknown whether mirabegron can reduce body weight and improve metabolic health. We investigated the antiobesity effects of mirabegron using both in vitro and in vivo models. Mouse brown preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells were treated with different concentrations of mirabegron (0.03-3 g/ml), and the expression of brown fat-related genes was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 10 weeks, and mirabegron ( mg/kg body weight) or a vehicle control was delivered to the interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) using ALZET osmotic pumps from week 7 to 10. The metabolic parameters and tissues were analyzed. In both mouse brown preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells, mirabegron stimulated uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression. In animal studies, mirabegron-treated mice had a lower body weight and adiposity. Lipid droplets in the iBAT of mirabegron-treated mice were fewer and smaller in size compared with those from vehicle-treated mice. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry indicated that mirabegron increased the abundance of beige cells in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). Compared with vehicle-treated mice, mirabegron-treated mice had a higher gene expression of UCP1 (14-fold) and cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha-like effector A (CIDEA) (4-fold) in iWAT. Furthermore, mirabegron-treated mice had improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Taken together, mirabegron enhances UCP1 expression and promotes  of iWAT, which are accompanied by improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and prevention from high-fat diet-induced obesity.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659023>Natural human genetic variation determines basal and inducible expression of , an obesity-associated gene.</a></h1><p>PM20D1 is a candidate thermogenic enzyme in mouse fat, with its expression cold-induced and enriched in brown versus white adipocytes.

In contrast,  is one of the most strongly TZD-induced transcripts in human adipocytes, although not in cells from all individuals. Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +.5 kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human fat as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS. These  low-expression variants may account for human genetic associations in this region with obesity as well as neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608078>Diurnal Harvest Cycle and Sap Composition Affect Under-Skin  in 'Honey Gold' Mango Fruit.</a></h1><p>Under-skin  (USB) is an unsightly physiological disorder that afflicts 'Honey Gold' mango fruit. Under-skin  symptoms develop after harvest upon the interaction of physical abrasion and physiological chilling stresses. Less understood preharvest and/or harvest factors may also influence fruit susceptibility to USB. In this study, we examined the impact of harvest time during the diurnal cycle and fruit sap components on USB development. Fruits were harvested at 4- to 6-h intervals, lightly abraded with sandpaper to simulate vibration damage during refrigerated road transport, held at 12 ± 1°C for 6 days, transported to the research facilities and ripened before USB assessment. Spurt and ooze sap from the fruit were collected at each harvest time. The samples were separated and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fruit harvested at 10:00, 14:00 and 18:00 h had 3- to 5-fold higher incidence of USB than did those picked at 22:00, :00 and 6:00 h. Sap concentrations of the key aroma volatile compounds -carene, 3-carene, α-terpinene, -cymene, limonene and α-terpinolene were higher for fruit harvested at 14:00 h compared to those picked at other times. In the fruits harvested in the afternoon, abraded skin treated with spurt sap sampled at 14:00 h had 14.3- and 29.0-fold higher incidence and severity, respectively, of induced  than did those treated with sap collected at 6:00 h. The results showed that fruit harvested in the afternoon were more susceptible to USB than those picked at night or in early morning. The diurnal variation in fruit sensitivity was evidently associated with specific compositional differences in sap phytotoxicity. Topical application to the fruit skin of pure terpinolene and limonene resulted in induced USB damage, whereas pure carene and distilled water did not. Microscopy examination showed that while skin damage caused by pure terpinolene and limonene was not identical to USB per se, similarities suggested that sap components cause USB under inductive commercial conditions. Considered collectively, these findings suggest that night and early morning harvesting will reduce USB and thus improve the postharvest quality of Honey Gold mango fruit.Copyright © 2019 San, Hofman, Joyce, Macnish, Marques, Webb, Li and Smyth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200837>Mouse Models of Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer: Key Considerations for Clinical Translation Based on Molecular Subtypes.</a></h1><p>In the past few years, research has suggested that molecular subtypes in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) may be exploited to accelerate developments in clinical disease management and novel therapeutics.To review MIBC mouse models from a molecular subtype perspective, their advantages and limitations, and their applications in translational medicine, based on a PubMed search for publications from January 2000 to February 2018.Publications relevant to MIBC mouse models and their molecular subtypes were identified in a literature review.We classified the models according to the technique used for their establishment. For xenotransplant and allograft models, the inoculated cells and inoculated locations are the major determinants of molecular subtypes. Although the cell lines used in xenotransplant models can cover most of the basal-squamous and luminal subtypes, allograft models offer a more realistic environment in which to reconstruct aspects of the associated stromal and immune features. Autochthonous models, using genetic and/or chemical stimuli to induce disease progression, can also generate models with basal-squamous and luminal subtypes, but further molecular characterisation is needed since other mutational variants may be introduced in these models.We identified preclinical MIBC models with different subtype specifications and assessed their promise and current limitations. These models are versatile tools that can reproduce the molecular complexity of MIBC and support novel therapeutic development.Understanding which models of muscle-invasive bladder cancer most accurately represent the clinical situation is important for the development of novel drugs and disease management strategies.

The accumulation of succinate in macrophages is known to activate a pro-inflammatory program; however, the contribution of SUCNR1 to macrophage phenotype and function has remained unclear. Here we found that activation of SUCNR1 had a critical role in the anti-inflammatory responses in macrophages. Myeloid-specific deficiency in SUCNR1 promoted a local pro-inflammatory phenotype, disrupted glucose homeostasis in mice fed a normal chow diet, exacerbated the metabolic consequences of diet-induced obesity and impaired adipose-tissue  in response to cold exposure. Activation of SUCNR1 promoted an anti-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages and boosted the response of these cells to type  cytokines, including interleukin-4. Succinate decreased the expression of inflammatory markers in adipose tissue from lean human subjects but not that from obese subjects, who had lower expression of SUCNR1 in adipose-tissue-resident macrophages. Our findings highlight the importance of succinate-SUCNR1 signaling in determining macrophage polarization and assign a role to succinate in limiting inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537967>Optimization of High Intensity Ultrasound Treatment of Proso Millet Bran to Improve Physical and Nutritional Quality.</a></h1><p>Millet is an unexploited cereal with potential in the food industry due to its nutritional value and resistance to harsh climate conditions. Nutritious millet byproducts have a potential application in the development of functional cereal products, but require processing in order to improve their physical and nutritional quality. Therefore, we investigated high intensity ultrasound as a pretreatment to increase the amount of freely available bioactives from proso millet bran. We also analysed the effect of high intensity ultrasound on enzymatic , water retention and protein digestibility, which are crucial for the utilization in the bakery and pasta industry. A 15% millet bran suspension in water was treated with 400-W ultrasound probe for 5, 12.5 or 20 min, with the 60, 80 or 100% amplitude. High intensity ultrasound treatment with 80% amplitude for 12.5 min improved most significantly the nutritive value; the antioxidant activity measured by FRAP test increased by 15% (p<0.05), and total phenolic content by 16% (p<0.05). Still, the impact on the increase of water-soluble and ethanol-insoluble dietary fibre by 38% was evident after the treatment for 20 min at 100% amplitude. High intensity ultrasound treatment at 100% amplitude for 5 min caused the largest improvements in water retention and limited  of the sample. High intensity ultrasound treatment activated polyphenol oxidase, regardless of the applied heating of the sample. Due to its ambiguous impact on proso millet bran characteristics, the treatment required an optimization, which showed that the optimal pretreatment of a 15% millet bran suspension in water is at 100% amplitude for 9.3 min.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117920>Sphenopalatine Ganglion Stimulation to Augment Cerebral Blood Flow.</a></h1><p>Background and Purpose- Many patients with acute ischemic stroke are not eligible for thrombolysis or mechanical reperfusion therapies due to contraindications, inaccessible vascular occlusions, late presentation, or large infarct core. Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) stimulation to enhance collateral flow and stabilize the blood-brain barrier offers an alternative, potentially more widely deliverable, therapy. Methods- In a randomized, sham-controlled, double-masked trial at 41 centers in 7 countries, patients with anterior circulation ischemic stroke not treated with reperfusion therapies within 24 hours of onset were randomly allocated to active SPG stimulation or sham control. The primary efficacy outcome was improvement beyond expectations on the modified Rankin Scale of global disability at 90 days (sliding dichotomy), assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population. The initial planned sample size was 660 patients, but the trial was stopped early when technical improvements in device placement occurred, so that analysis of accumulated experience could be conducted to inform a successor trial. Results- Among 303 enrolled patients, 253 received at least one active SPG or sham stimulation, constituting the modified intention-to-treat population (153 SPG stimulation and 100 sham control). Age was median 73 years (interquartile range, 64-79), 52.6% were female, deficit severity on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was median 11 (interquartile range, 9-15), and time from last known well median 18.6 hours (interquartile range, 14.5-22.5). For the primary outcome, improved 3-month disability beyond expectations, rates in the SPG versus sham treatment groups were 49.7% versus 40.0%; odds ratio, 1.48 (95% CI, 0.89-.47); P=0.13. A significant treatment interaction with stroke location (cortical versus noncortical) was noted, P=0.04. In the 87 patients with confirmed cortical involvement, rates of improvement beyond expectations were 50.0% versus 27.0%; odds ratio, .70 (95% CI, 1.08-6.73); P=0.03. Similar response patterns were observed for all prespecified secondary efficacy outcomes. No differences in mortality or serious adverse event safety end points were observed. Conclusions- SPG stimulation within 24 hours of onset is safe in acute ischemic stroke. SPG stimulation was not shown to statistically significantly improve 3-month disability above expectations, though favorable outcomes were nominally higher with SPG stimulation. Beneficial effects may distinctively be conferred in patients with confirmed cortical involvement. The results of this study need to be confirmed in a larger pivotal study.

Patients gradually lose subcutaneous fat from the limbs, while they accumulate adipose tissue in the face and neck. Several studies have demonstrated that autophagy is involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and the maintenance of the balance between white and brown adipose tissue. We identified deregulation of autophagy in laminopathic preadipocytes before induction of differentiation. Moreover, in differentiating white adipocyte precursors, we observed impairment of large lipid droplet formation, altered regulation of adipose tissue genes, and expression of the brown adipose tissue marker UCP1. Conversely, in lipodystrophic brown adipocyte precursors induced to differentiate, we noticed activation of autophagy, formation of enlarged lipid droplets typical of white adipocytes, and dysregulation of brown adipose tissue genes. In agreement with these in vitro results indicating conversion of FPLD2 brown preadipocytes toward the white lineage, adipose tissue from FPLD2 patient neck, an area of brown adipogenesis, showed a white phenotype reminiscent of its brown origin. Moreover, in vivo morpho-functional evaluation of fat depots in the neck area of three FPLD2 patients by PET/CT analysis with cold stimulation showed the absence of brown adipose tissue activity. These findings highlight a new pathogenetic mechanism leading to improper fat distribution in lamin A-linked lipodystrophies and show that both impaired white adipocyte turnover and failure of adipose tissue  contribute to disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30792482>Thermogenesis-independent metabolic benefits conferred by isocaloric intermittent fasting in ob/ob mice.</a></h1><p>Intermittent fasting (IF) is an effective dietary intervention to counteract obesity-associated metabolic abnormalities. Previously, we and others have highlighted white adipose tissue (WAT)  as the main underlying mechanism of IF-mediated metabolic benefits. However, whether IF retains its efficacy in different models, such as genetically obese/diabetic animals, is unknown. Here, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice were subjected to 16 weeks of isocaloric IF, and comprehensive metabolic phenotyping was conducted to assess the metabolic effects of IF. Unlike our previous study, isocaloric IF-subjected ob/ob animals failed to exhibit reduced body weight gain, lower fat mass, or decreased liver lipid accumulation. Moreover, isocaloric IF did not result in increased thermogenesis nor induce WAT  in ob/ob mice. These findings indicate that isocaloric IF may not be an effective approach for regulating body weight in ob/ob animals, posing the possible limitations of IF to treat obesity. However, despite the lack of improvement in insulin sensitivity, isocaloric IF-subjected ob/ob animals displayed improved glucose tolerance as well as higher postprandial insulin level, with elevated incretin expression, suggesting that isocaloric IF is effective in improving nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion. Together, this study uncovers the insulinotropic effect of isocaloric IF, independent of adipose thermogenesis, which is potentially complementary for the treatment of type  diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31150673>Novel morpholine containing cinnamoyl amides as potent tyrosinase inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Tyrosinase enzyme plays a crucial role in melanin biosynthesis and enzymatic  process of vegetables and fruits. Hence, tyrosinase inhibitors are important in the fields of medicine, cosmetics and agriculture. In this study, novel N-(-morpholinoethyl)cinnamamide derivatives bearing different substituents on phenyl ring were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their tyrosinase diphenolase inhibitory activity. The compounds were found to be better tyrosinase inhibitors (ICs were in micro molar range) than cinnamic acid. (E)-3-(3-chlorophenyl)-N-(-morpholinoethyl)acrylamide (B6) exhibited the highest inhibition with IC value of 15. ± 0.6 μM which was comparable to that of kojic acid. The inhibition kinetic analysis of B6 indicated that the compound was a mixed-type tyrosinase inhibitor. In silico ADME prediction indicated that B6 might show more skin penetration than kojic acid. Molecular docking analysis confirmed that the active inhibitors well accommodated in the mushroom tyrosinase active site and it was also revealed that B6 formed the most stable drug-receptor complex with the target protein. Therefore, cinnamamide B6 could be introduced as a potent tyrosinase inhibitor that might be a promising lead in cosmetics, medicine and food industry.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, physiological changes consequent to signal control were examined in vivo using lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J mice.Combined treatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist rosiglitazone, the SMAD3 inhibitor SIS3 and the adrenergic receptor agonist noradrenaline (norepinephrine) synergistically induced Ucp1, Fgf21 and Cited1 expression, triggering brown adipogenesis. Synergistic induction of Ucp1 by the three agents was negatively regulated by forkhead box O (FOXO)3 via the inhibition of PPARγ-dependent gene transcription. Moreover, the administration of rosiglitazone, SIS3 and the selective β3 adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 to DIO mice reduced the amount of body-fat deposits (body weight from day 0 to 14, 12.3% reduction), concomitant with morphological changes in white adipose tissue, an increase in mitochondrial biosynthesis and a marked induction of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Furthermore, administration of the three agents significantly increased serum adiponectin levels (mean 65.56 μg/ml with the three agents vs 20.79 μg/ml in control mice, p < 0.05) and improved glucose and lipid tolerance.These results suggest that the combined regulation of PPARγ, SMAD and the adrenergic receptor signalling pathway synergistically induces brown adipogenesis and may serve as an effective strategy to treat obesity and related diseases, including type  diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123110>Germline selection shapes human mitochondrial DNA diversity.</a></h1><p>Approximately .4% of the human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome exhibits common homoplasmic genetic variation. We analyzed 12,975 whole-genome sequences to show that 45.1% of individuals from 1526 mother-offspring pairs harbor a mixed population of mtDNA (heteroplasmy), but the propensity for maternal transmission differs across the mitochondrial genome. Over one generation, we observed selection both for and against variants in specific genomic regions; known variants were more likely to be transmitted than previously unknown variants. However, new heteroplasmies were more likely to match the nuclear genetic ancestry as opposed to the ancestry of the mitochondrial genome on which the mutations occurred, validating our findings in 40,325 individuals. Thus, human mtDNA at the population level is shaped by selective forces within the female germ line under nuclear genetic control, which ensures consistency between the two independent genetic lineages.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

We previously showed that mild neonatal supplementations with the polyphenol resveratrol (RSV) and the vitamin B3 form nicotinamide riboside (NR) have sex-dependent, long-term effects on the thermogenic/oxidative phenotype of WAT of mice in adulthood, enhancing this phenotype selectively in male animals. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these dietary interventions may impact the commitment of progenitor cells resident in the developing WAT toward brown-like (beige) adipogenesis. NMRI mice received orally from postnatal day -20 (P2-20) a mild dose of RSV or NR, in independent experiments; control littermates received the vehicle. Sex-separated primary cultures were established at P35 from the stromovascular fraction of inguinal WAT (iWAT) and of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Expression of genes related to thermogenesis and oxidative metabolism was assessed in the differentiated cultures, and  in the iWAT depot of young (P35) animals. Neonatal RSV and NR treatments had little impact on the animals' growth during early postnatal life and the expression of thermogenesis- and oxidative metabolism-related genes in the iWAT depot of young mice. However, the expression of brown/beige adipocyte marker genes was upregulated in the iWAT primary cultures from RSV supplemented and NR supplemented male mice, and downregulated in those from supplemented female mice, as compared to cultures derived from sex-matched control littermates. RSV supplementation had similar sex-dependent effects on the expression of thermogenesis-related genes in the BAT primary cultures. A link between the sex-dependent short-term effects of neonatal RSV and NR supplementations on primary iWAT preadipocyte differentiation observed herein and their previously reported sex-dependent long-term effects on the thermogenic/oxidative capacity of adult iWAT is suggested. The results provide proof-of-concept that the fate of preadipocytes resident in WAT of young animals toward the beige adipogenesis transcriptional program can be modulated by specific food bioactives/micronutrients received in early postnatal life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581168>Characteristics of a Multistate Outbreak of Lung Injury Associated with E-cigarette Use, or Vaping - United States, 2019.</a></h1><p>Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), also called vapes, e-hookas, vape pens, tank systems, mods, and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are electronic devices that produce an aerosol by heating a liquid typically containing nicotine, flavorings, and other additives; users inhale this aerosol into their lungs (1). E-cigarettes also can be used to deliver tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive component of cannabis (1). Use of e-cigarettes is commonly called vaping. Lung injury associated with e-cigarette use, or vaping, has recently been reported in most states (-4). CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local health departments, and others are investigating this outbreak. This report provides data on patterns of the outbreak and characteristics of patients, including sex, age, and selected substances used in e-cigarette, or vaping, products reported to CDC as part of this ongoing multistate investigation. As of September 24, 2019, 46 state health departments and one territorial health department had reported 805 patients with cases of lung injury associated with use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products to CDC. Sixty-nine percent of patients were males, and the median age was 23 years (range = 13-72 years). To date, 12 deaths have been confirmed in 10 states. Among 514 patients with information on substances used in e-cigarettes, or vaping products, in the 30 days preceding symptom onset, 76.9% reported using THC-containing products, and 56.8% reported using nicotine-containing products; 36.0% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products, and 16.0% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products.

Insulin resistance/sensitivity was measured using HOMA and glucose infusion rate during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp.  In both cohort 1 and cohort ,  and thermogenic/beige-related gene expression were significantly increased in VAT compared to SAT. Adipogenic-related genes followed an opposite pattern. In cohort 1, VAT  gene expression was positively correlated with BMI and expression of , and negatively with adipogenic (, and )- and inflammatory ()-related genes.

Tyrosinase inhibitors are of great interest in medicine and cosmetics (skin whitening compounds), but also in food and beverage industry (antibrowning agents). Here we report on the activity as mushroom tyrosinase inhibitors of a series of hydroxyphenyl thiosemicarbazones (1-5): one of them revealed an inhibitory activity stronger than kojic acid, used as reference. Enzymatic inhibition activity was confirmed by colorimetric measurements on small wheels of Fuji apples treated with the hydroxyphenyl thiosemicarbazones. The mechanism of action of compounds 1-5 was investigated by molecular modelling and by studying in solution their speciation with Cu(II) ions, the ions in the active site of the enzyme. Finally, compounds 1-5 were tested on human fibroblasts: they are not cytotoxic and they do not activate cells in a pro-inflammatory way.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Three hydroxycinnamic acids, p-coumaric acid (1), caffeic acid () and rosmarinic acid (3), were isolated as mainly responsible for its activity. Compounds 1,  and 3 showed themselves highly effective for inhibiting tyrosinase with IC values of 0.30, 1.50 and 4.14 μM, respectively, for monophenolase activity and 0.62, .30 and 8.59 μM, respectively for diphenolase activity. This is the first report describing the isolation of the compounds causing the tyrosinase inhibitory activity of L. meyenii extract. The inhibitory kinetics of 1-3 using both L-tyrosine and L-DOPA as substrates was investigated and the results obtained were discussed at molecular level by docking analysis. The resulting compounds 1-3 and a phenolic-enriched fraction of the extract, .9-fold more active than the starting material, may be suitable as non-toxic and inexpensive alternatives for the control of deleterious enzymatic darkening.Copyright © 2019.

Aim of the study was to investigate the immunometabolic role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the obesity. We performed both BAT transplantation as well as extirpation experiments in the mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. We carried out immune cell profiling in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). BAT transplantation reversed HFD-induced increase in body weight gain and insulin resistance without altering diet intake. Importantly, BAT transplantation attenuated the obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation in terms of decreased pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages, cytotoxic CD8a T-cells and restored anti-inflammatory regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in the eWAT. BAT transplantation also improved endogenous BAT activity by elevating protein expression of  markers (UCP-1, PRDM16 and PGC1α) in it. In addition, BAT transplantation promoted the eWAT expression of various genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (such as Elvol3 and Tfam,). In contrast, extirpation of the interscapular BAT exacerbated HFD-induced obesity, insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation (by increasing M1 macrophages, CD8a T-cell and decreasing Tregs in eWAT). Taken together, our results suggested an important role of BAT in combating obesity-associated metabolic complications. These results open a novel therapeutic option to target obesity and related metabolic disorders like type  diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Pupil size, globe position, tear production, and intraocular pressure measurements were recorded at 5, 30, and 45 minutes after induction of anesthesia. For each BTPD, a phenol red thread test was performed in one randomly selected eye and a modified Schirmer tear test I was performed in the other eye. Intraocular pressure was measured by rebound tonometry.Compared with findings for the DKM protocol, pupil size was smaller at all time points when the BTPDs underwent the ISO protocol. Globe position remained central during anesthesia with the DKM protocol, whereas it varied among central, ventromedial, and ventrolateral positions during anesthesia with the ISO protocol. Tear production and intraocular pressure decreased significantly over time when the BTPDs underwent either protocol.Results indicated that ophthalmic examination findings for anesthetized BTPDs can be influenced by the anesthetic protocol used. The DKM protocol may result in more consistent pupil size and globe position, compared with that achieved by use of the ISO protocol. Tear production and intraocular pressure measurements should be conducted promptly after induction of anesthesia to avoid the effect of anesthetic episode duration on these variables.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558994>Measurement of serum irisin in the different stages of chronic kidney disease.</a></h1><p>Irisin is a myokine that regulates energy metabolism by inducing  of adipose tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between irisin level and biochemical parameters of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients in stage  and stage 4The research was a cross-sectional study; the study population included patients with CKD who were over 18 years of age, included 90 individuals with CKD, of these participants, 45 were in the second stage of the CKD while the other 45 subjects were in the fourth stage. Serum irisin concentration plus the level of glucose (Glu), urea, creatinine (Cr) and hemoglobin (Hb) were measured.In the present study, the serum irisin level of patients in stage 4 was significantly reduced (13.00 ng / ml) compared with patients in stage (21.41 ng / ml).With the progression of CKD from stage  to stage 4, parameters such as serum Cr, TG, LDL, FBS, BUN and urea levels significantly increased. Inversely, factors such as irisin, GFR, Alb, HDL and Hb levels significantly decreased. These findings suggest that irisin may be involved in the regulation of biochemical factor levels in CKD patients through the progression from stage  to stage 4.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804793>Beta 3 Adrenergic Receptor Activation Rescues Metabolic Dysfunction in Female Estrogen Receptor Alpha-Null Mice.</a></h1><p>Metabolic disease risk escalates following menopause. The mechanism is not fully known, but likely involves reduced signaling through estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), which is highly expressed in brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT).  Test the hypothesis that uncoupling protein (UCP1) activation mitigates metabolic dysfunction caused by loss of signaling through ERα.  At 8 weeks of age, female ERα knock out (KO) and wild-type mice were housed at 28°C and fed a Western-style high-fat, high sucrose diet (HFD) or a normal low-fat chow diet (NC) for 10 weeks. During the final  weeks, they received daily injections of CL 316,256 (CL), a selective β3 adrenergic agonist, or vehicle control (CTRL), creating eight groups: WT-CTRL, WT-CL, KO-CTRL, and KO-CL on HFD or NC;  = 4-10/group.  ERαKO demonstrated exacerbated HFD-induced adiposity gain ( < 0.001) and insulin resistance ( = 0.006). CL treatment improved insulin sensitivity ( < 0.05) and normalized ERαKO-induced adiposity increase ( < 0.05). In both genotypes, CL increased resting energy expenditure ( < 0.05) and induced WAT beiging indicated by increased UCP1 protein in both perigonadal (PGAT) and subcutaneous (SQAT) depots. These effects were attenuated under HFD conditions ( < 0.05). In KO, CL reduced HFD energy consumption compared to CTRL ( < 0.05). Remarkably, CL increased WAT ERβ protein levels of both WT and KO ( < 0.001), revealing CL-mediated changes in estrogen signaling may have protective metabolic effects.  CL completely restored metabolic dysfunction in ERαKO mice.

We assessed long-term effects of hyperoxia on  of adipocytes and carbohydrate metabolism in a murine model of type  diabetes.Male Wistar rats (190-210 g) were divided into 4 groups: Control, O-treated control, untreated diabetes, and O-treated diabetes. Diabetes was induced using high-fat diet followed by a low-dose of streptozotocin (30 mg/kg). Hyperoxia sessions were included -h exposure to 95% oxygen, repeated 6 days/week for 5 weeks. Serum fasting glucose, insulin, lactate, and lipid profile were measured before, during, and after hyperoxia. Glucose and pyruvate tolerance tests, and histological evaluations of interscapular and epididymal fats were done at the end of study.O-treated diabetic rats compared to untreated ones, displayed lower weight gain, improved glucose-tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and more favorable lipid profile. In diabetic rats, hyperoxia increased surface area (6.36 ± 0.93 vs. 0.86 ± 0.16 mm, P < 0.001), and volume density (1.53 ± 0.22 vs. 0.21 ± 0.04 mm, P < 0.001) of interscapular adipose tissue; hyperoxia also increased protein levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), and PPAR-γ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1-α) in interscapular adipose tissue. The numerical density (541.7 ± 7.3 vs. 298.1 ± 11.7 mm, P < 0.001) of epididymal fat were also higher.This study showed that beneficial metabolic effects of hyperoxia in obese type  diabetic rats including improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance are at least in part due to  of adipose tissue.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

"Xiaobai" and "Daliguang"). The NFT storage temperatures for the "Xiaobai" apricot and "Daliguang" apricot were determined as -1.9 to -.3°C and -1. to -1.6°C, respectively. Storage at NFT significantly improved the storage quality of apricots by suppressing respiration rate, ethylene production, decay rate, internal  index, membrane permeability, and malondialdehyde content. Apricots stored at NFT maintained higher firmness, total soluble solids, titrable acid, total phenolics, total flavonoids, and ascorbic acid content than those stored at 0-1°C. Additionally, NFT storage enhanced the capacity of radical scavenging and metal chelating, antioxidant properties in apricots compared to those stored at 0-1°C. Hence, NFT storage proved to be an effective method to improve the quality and antioxidant attributes of apricots. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study explored the effect of storage at near freezing temperature (NFT) on the postharvest quality of two cultivars of apricot (var. "Xiaobai" and "Daliguang"). We found that storage for 70 days at NFT resulted in better edible quality compared to storage at 0-1°C and 4-6°C. Apricot quality was determined in terms of respiration rate, ethylene production, decay rate, internal  index, membrane permeability, malondialdehyde content, firmness, total soluble solids, titrable acid, total phenolics, total flavonoids, and ascorbic acid content. The antioxidant properties of the fruits were also retained during storage at NFT. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the preservative industry because it demonstrates the superiority of NFT storage over low temperature for apricots.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847736>Changes in Bile Acid Metabolism, Transport, and Signaling as Central Drivers for Metabolic Improvements After Bariatric Surgery.</a></h1><p>We review current evidence regarding changes in bile acid (BA) metabolism, transport, and signaling after bariatric surgery and how these might bolster fat mass loss and energy expenditure to promote improvements in type  diabetes (T2D) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).The two most common bariatric techniques, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), increase the size and alter the composition of the circulating BA pool that may then impact energy metabolism through altered activities of BA targets in the many tissues perfused by systemic blood. Recent reports in human patients indicate that gene expression of the major BA target, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), is increased in the liver but decreased in the small intestine after RYGB. In contrast, intestinal expression of the transmembrane G protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5) is upregulated after surgery. Despite these apparent conflicting changes in receptor transcription, changes in BAs after both RYGB and VSG are associated with elevated postprandial systemic levels of fibroblast growth factor 19 (from FXR activation) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (from TGR5 activation). These signaling activities are presumed to support fat mass loss and related metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery, and this supposition is in agreement with findings from rodent models of RYGB and VSG. However, inter-species differences in BA physiology limit direct translation and mechanistic understanding of how changes in individual BA species contribute to post-operative improvements of T2D and NAFLD in humans. Thus, details of all these changes and their influences on BAs' biological actions are still under scrutiny. Changes in BA physiology and receptor activities after RYGB and VSG likely support weight loss and promote sustained metabolic improvements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140724>Differential Anti-Adipogenic Effects of Eicosapentaenoic and Docosahexaenoic Acids in Obesity.</a></h1><p>To assess the associations of plasma eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with body fat in a population-based sample and explore the mechanism of action based on  of white adipose tissue (WAT) in high-fat-diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Plasma EPA and DHA of 1719 adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2004) are determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry, while total body fat is measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. DIO mice are fed a high-fat diet supplemented with EPA or DHA (1% wt/wt) for 15 weeks and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are treated with EPA or DHA during differentiation. Plasma DHA but not EPA is associated with lower body fat mass (p < 0.0001), which persists in overweight/obese subjects (p = 0.02). DHA supplementation reduces inguinal WAT and exhibits a more pronounced thermogenic effect than EPA in DIO mice. In vitro, the  process is induced after -day and 6-day treatment with DHA and EPA, respectively.Plasma DHA but not EPA is inversely associated with body fat mass. The more potent anti-adipogenic effect of DHA than EPA may involve a better capability of inducing  of WAT for DHA.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In contrast, arginine and lysine did not lead to any amino acid adducts. Target compounds were separated by high-performance countercurrent chromatography and preparative HPLC and unequivocally characterized by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mechanistic incubations starting from the catechin-cysteine adducts showed that both catechin and PPO are crucial components in the formation of the dihydrobenzothiazines. The cysteine incubations showed a red-brown coloration, which coincided with formation and degradation of the dihydrobenzothiazines finally leading to the formation of high-polymeric melanins.

Purpose To develop a dual-energy CT method for differentiating isoattenuating gallstones from bile and compare it with previously reported dual-energy CT methods by using a prospective ex vivo phantom reader study. Materials and Methods From May 2017 to May 2018, gallstones were collected from 105 patients (34 men; mean age, 51 years; age range, 18-84 years) undergoing cholecystectomy and placed inside 120-mL vials containing ox bile. The vials were placed inside a water-filled phantom and were scanned with dual-layer dual-energy CT. Thirty isoattenuating gallstones (4.3-24.7 mm in diameter) were evaluated. Conventional CT images, virtual noncontrast images, and monoenergetic images at 200 and 40 keV were created. Segmented images were created by using a two-dimensional histogram of Compton and photoelectric attenuation. Six readers evaluated the presence of isoattenuating gallstones in each image. Intra- and interreader agreement was measured by using percentage agreement, diagnostic performance was evaluated by using mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) estimates and pairwise comparisons, and the agreement of gallstone sizes measured at pathologic examination with those measured on segmented images was compared by using Bland-Altman analysis. Results For all gallstones, segmented images provided the highest mean intrareader (88.1%) and interreader (88.% and 93.6%) agreements for all readers and reading sessions and the highest overall AUC (0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97, 1.00; adjusted  < .02 for all). For gallstones larger than 9 mm, no significant difference was found between the segmented and monoenergetic AUCs (all  > .94, adjusted  > .05 for all). For gallstones measuring 9 mm or smaller, the segmented images had the highest overall AUC (0.99; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.00; adjusted  < .01 for all). The mean difference in stone sizes was -0.6 mm, with limits of agreement from .6 to -3.8 mm. Conclusion Segmented images from Compton and photoelectric attenuation coefficients improve detection of isoattenuating gallstones compared with previously reported dual-energy CT methods.© RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by Matos in this issue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655012>Hypocretin/orexin modulates body weight and the metabolism of glucose and insulin.</a></h1><p>The hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt/orexin) unit affects the functions of several organ systems including the nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and the reproductive systems. This review examines the tissue distribution of the hcrt/orexin system and the variety of biological activities attributed to it. Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to obesity, and insulin and glucose metabolism. Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin  receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein  and glucagon. Literature reports show that hcrt/orexin can significantly increase insulin secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreata. Moreover, several studies reported that the tissue expression of glucose transporter type 4 is markedly higher after treatment with orexin. Hcrt/orexin also decreases blood glucose concentration and reduces insulin resistance. It reduces obesity by increasing  of fat cells and energy expenditure. Taken together, hcrt/orexin modulates obesity and the metabolism of glucose and insulin. The Hcrt/orexin system may thus be a target in the development of new therapies for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.This article is protected by copyright.

Glutamic acid and arginine were higher in constituent amino acids. In the taste value, glutamic acid was highest in constituent and free amino acids. Total phenol contents were highest in 0 min and lowest in 3 min. Hundred twenty-six volatile compounds were detected by GC/MS during roasting. α-pinene, eudesmol, nonane, and limonene were detected as major volatile compounds. For antioxidant ability, 1,1-diphenyl--picrylhydrazyl did not change during roasting, and ,'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid showed the highest value in 3 min.  intensity showed a slight decrease over time. In Electronic nose, fragrance increased by roasting, and strength, NH , and H S decreased significantly. In Electronic tongue, sweetness, bitterness, and umami taste increased by roasting, and this was related to amino acid composition. The results provide basic data on the physicochemical and flavor characteristics of A. gigas Nakai according to the roasting process. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Angelica gigas Nakai has been known as a medicinal herb in Asian countries and usually consumed in powder, tea, and snacks. In order to produce the powder, tea, or snacks with A. gigas Nakai, thermal treatment is an essential and critical process. Despite that existing studies reported many physiological benefits and functional properties of A. gigas Nakai, studies have rarely discovered how the nutritional properties and volatile compounds of A. gigas Nakai alter when it undergoes thermal treatment.

CT subjects have normal-range hormonal profiles and food intake but exhibit resistance to weight gain despite living in the modern world's obesogenic environment.The goal of this study is to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenotype against weight gain.We conducted a clinical overfeeding study on 30 CT subjects and 30 controls (BMI 20-25 kg/m2) matched for age and sex. We performed clinical and integrative molecular and transcriptomic analyses on white adipose and muscle tissues.Our results demonstrate that adipocytes were markedly smaller in CT individuals (mean ± SEM: 2174 ± 142 μm ) compared with controls (3586 ± 216 μm2) (P < 0.01). The mitochondrial respiratory capacity was higher in CT adipose tissue, particularly at the level of complex II of the electron transport chain (.-fold increase; P < 0.01). This higher activity was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial number (CT compared with control: 784 ± 27 compared with 675 ± 30 mitochondrial DNA molecules per cell; P < 0.05). No evidence for uncoupled respiration or "" of the white adipose tissue was found. In accordance with the mitochondrial differences, CT subjects had a distinct adipose transcriptomic profile [62 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate of 0.1 and log fold change >0.75)], with many differentially expressed genes associating with positive metabolic outcomes. Pathway analyses revealed an increase in fatty acid oxidation ( P = 3 × 10-04) but also triglyceride biosynthesis (P = 3.6 × 10-04). No differential response to the overfeeding was observed in the  groups.The distinct molecular signature of the adipose tissue in CT individuals suggests the presence of augm ented futile lipid cycling, rather than mitochondrial uncoupling, as a way to increase energy expenditure in CT individuals. We propose that increased mitochondrial function in adipose tissue is an important mediator in sustaining the low body weight in CT individuals.

We collected data on changes in metabolic parameters (glucose, serum lipids, triglycerides; total, low-density, and high-density cholesterol; and total body weight) and soft tissues (abdominal subcutaneous fat [SAT], adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue [VAT], and muscle) from patients 5 years before the received a diagnosis of PDAC.We collected data from 219 patients with a diagnosis of PDAC (patients) and 657 healthy individuals (controls) from the Rochester Epidemiology Project, from 2000 through 2015. We compared metabolic profiles of patients with those of age- and sex-matched controls, constructing temporal profiles of fasting blood glucose, serum lipids including triglycerides, cholesterol profiles, and body weight and temperature for 60 months before the diagnosis of PDAC (index date). To construct the temporal profile of soft tissue changes, we collected computed tomography scans from 68 patients, comparing baseline (>18 months before diagnosis) areas of SAT, VAT, and muscle at L2/L3 vertebra with those of later scans until time of diagnosis. SAT and VAT, isolated from healthy individuals, were exposed to exosomes isolated from PDAC cell lines and analyzed by RNA sequencing. SAT was collected from KRASG12D P53 mice with PDACs, C57/BL6 (control) mice, and 5 patients and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry.There were no significant differences in metabolic or soft tissue features of patients vs controls until 30 months before PDAC diagnosis. In the 30 to 18 months before PDAC diagnosis (phase 1, hyperglycemia), a significant proportion of patients developed hyperglycemia, compared with controls, without soft tissue changes. In the 18 to 6 months before PDAC diagnosis (phase , pre-cachexia), patients had significant increases in hyperglycemia and decreases in serum lipids, body weight, and SAT, with preserved VAT and muscle. In the 6 to 0 months before PDAC diagnosis (phase 3, cachexia), a significant proportion of patients had hyperglycemia compared with controls, and patients had significant reductions in all serum lipids, SAT, VAT, and muscle. We believe the patients had  of SAT, based on increases in body temperature, starting 18 months before PDAC diagnosis. We observed expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in SAT exposed to PDAC exosomes, SAT from mice with PDACs, and SAT from all 5 patients but only 1 of 4 controls.We identified 3 phases of metabolic and soft tissue changes that precede a diagnosis of PDAC. Loss of SAT starts 18 months before PDAC identification, and is likely due to . Overexpression of UCP1 in SAT might be a biomarker of early-stage PDAC, but further studies are needed.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

High chronic inflammation is believed to be one biological pathway through which childhood adversity may affect health into adulthood. The Blackfeet tribal community has high rates of childhood trauma and community members are disproportionately affected by inflammatory diseases.To investigate whether belonging to the tribal community may moderate the relationship between childhood trauma and immune system inflammation in the Blackfeet tribal community.In a sample of 90 adults residing on the Blackfeet reservation, we measured ACEs belonging to the tribal community and two markers of immune system inflammation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP).We found that independent of age, gender, annual income, body mass index, and depressive symptoms, belonging to the tribal community and ACEs interacted to predict levels of both IL-6 and CRP (B= -.37, t[81] = -3.82, p < .001, R2 change = .07 and B = -.29, t[81] = -.75, p = .01, R2 change = .08, respectively). The association between ACEs and markers of immune system inflammation was statistically significant for community members who reported low levels of belonging to the community.The findings of this study have important implications for intervention research seeking to reduce risk for inflammatory diseases for at-risk populations. Fostering stronger connections to the larger tribal community may positively affect risk for inflammatory diseases. Future work should examine the behavioral and psychosocial pathways through which stronger connections to community may confer health benefits.© The Author(s) 2019.

We generated transgenic (TG) C57BL/6 mice expressing the Ptgs2 gene encoding cyclooxygenase- (COX-) in mature adipocytes. TG mice fed a high-fat diet displayed marginally lower weight gain with less hepatic steatosis and a slight improvement in insulin sensitivity, but no difference in glucose tolerance. Compared to littermate wildtype mice, TG mice selectively reduced inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) mass and fat cell size, whereas the epididymal (eWAT) fat depot remained unchanged. The changes in iWAT were accompanied by increased levels of specific COX-derived lipid mediators and increased mRNA levels of interleukin-33, interleukin-4 and arginase-1, but not increased expression of uncoupling protein 1 or increased energy expenditure. Epididymal WAT (eWAT) in TG mice exhibited few changes except from increased infiltration with eosinophils. Our findings suggest a role for COX--derived lipid mediators from adipocytes in mediating type  immunity cues in subcutaneous WAT associated with decreased hepatic steatosis, but with no accompanying induction of  and increased energy expenditure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31335316>Long term tapering versus standard prednisolone treatment for first episode of childhood nephrotic syndrome: phase III randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation.</a></h1><p>To determine whether extending initial prednisolone treatment from eight to 16 weeks in children with idiopathic steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome improves the pattern of disease relapse.Double blind, parallel group, phase III randomised placebo controlled trial, including a cost effectiveness analysis.125 UK National Health Service district general hospitals and tertiary paediatric nephrology centres.237 children aged 1-14 years with a first episode of steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome.Children were randomised to receive an extended 16 week course of prednisolone (total dose 3150 mg/m) or a standard eight week course of prednisolone (total dose 2240 mg/m). The drug was supplied as 5 mg tablets alongside matching placebo so that participants in both groups received the same number of tablets at any time point in the study. A minimisation algorithm ensured balanced treatment allocation by ethnicity (South Asian, white, or other) and age (5 years or less, 6 years or more).The primary outcome measure was time to first relapse over a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Secondary outcome measures were relapse rate, incidence of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome and steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome, use of alternative immunosuppressive treatment, rates of adverse events, behavioural change using the Achenbach child behaviour checklist, quality adjusted life years, and cost effectiveness from a healthcare perspective. Analysis was by intention to treat.No significant difference was found in time to first relapse (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.17, log rank P=0.28) or in the incidence of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (extended course 60/114 (53%)  standard course 55/109 (50%), P=0.75), steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome (48/114 (42%)  48/109 (44%), P=0.77), or requirement for alternative immunosuppressive treatment (62/114 (54%)  61/109 (56%), P=0.81). Total prednisolone dose after completion of the trial drug was 6674 mg for the extended course versus 5475 mg for the standard course (P=0.07). There were no statistically significant differences in serious adverse event rates (extended course 19/114 (17%)  standard course 27/109 (25%), P=0.13) or adverse event rates, with the exception of behaviour, which was poorer in the standard course group. Scores on the Achenbach child behaviour checklist did not, however, differ. Extended course treatment was associated with a mean increase in generic quality of life (0.0162 additional quality adjusted life years, 95% confidence interval -0.005 to 0.037) and cost savings (difference -£1673 ($2160; €1930), 95% confidence interval -£3455 to £109).Clinical outcomes did not improve when the initial course of prednisolone treatment was extended from eight to 16 weeks in UK children with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome. However, evidence was found of a short term health economic benefit through reduced resource use and increased quality of life.ISRCTN16645249; EudraCT 2010-022489-29.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

In this study, we explored the effect of  -Lapachone (  L), a compound obtained from the bark of the lapacho tree, against obesity.  administration of  L into either high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese C57BL6 mice and genetically obese   mice prevented body weight gain, which was associated with tissue weight loss of white adipose tissue (WAT). In addition,  L elevated thermogenic proteins including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and mitochondrial count in BAT and human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs).  L also induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, subsequent upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and UCP1, and these effects were diminished by AMPK inhibitor compound C, suggesting that AMPK underlies the effects of  L. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways participated in the thermogenesis of  L, specifically p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ (ERK1/) were activated by  L treatment in hAMSCs. Additionally, inhibitors of p38/JNK/ERK1/ abrogated the activity of  L. Taken together,  L exerts anti-obese effects by inducing thermogenesis mediated by AMPK signaling pathway, suggesting that  L may have a potential therapeutic implication of obesity. Taken together,  L exerts anti-obese effects by not only inducing thermogenesis on brown adipocytes but also inducing the  of white adipocytes. The anti-obese effect of  L is mediated by AMPK signaling pathway, suggesting that  L may have potential therapeutic implication of obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374438>The effects of pediatric obesity on patellofemoral joint contact force during walking.</a></h1><p>Obesity increases a child's risk of developing knee pain across the lifespan, potentially through elevated patellofemoral joint loads that occur during habitual weight-bearing activities.Do obese children have greater absolute and patellar-area-normalized patellofemoral joint forces compared to healthy weight children during walking?We utilized a cross-sectional design to address the aims of this study. Experimental biomechanics data were collected during treadmill walking in 10 healthy-weight and 10 obese 8-12 year-olds. We used radiographic images to develop subject-specific musculoskeletal models, generated walking simulations from the experimental data, and predicted patellofemoral joint contact force using established techniques.We found that the obese children had 1.98 times greater absolute (p = 0.002) and 1.81 times greater patellar-area-normalized (p = 0.008) patellofemoral joint contact forces compared to the healthy-weight children. We observed a stronger relationship between absolute patellofemoral joint contact force and BMI (r=0.58) than between patellofemoral joint contact force and body fat percentage (r=0.38).Our results indicate that obese children walk with increased patellofemoral loads in absolute terms and also relative to the area of the articulating surfaces, which likely contributes to the increased risk of knee pain in this pediatric population. This information, which provides a baseline comparison for future longitudinal studies, also informs the type and frequency of physical activity prescription aimed at reducing the risk of knee injury and improving long-term outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, many open questions remain about appropriate implementation of admixture mapping studies, including how best to control for multiple testing, particularly in the presence of population structure. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to characterize the correlation of local ancestry and admixture mapping test statistics in admixed populations with contributions from any number of ancestral populations and arbitrary population structure. Based on this framework, we develop an analytical approach for obtaining genome-wide significance thresholds for admixture mapping studies. We validate our approach via analysis of simulated traits with real genotype data for 8,064 unrelated African American and 3,425 Hispanic/Latina women from the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource (WHI SHARe). In an application to these WHI SHARe data, our approach yields genome-wide significant p value thresholds of .1 × 10 and 4.5 × 10 for admixture mapping studies in the African American and Hispanic/Latina cohorts, respectively. Compared to other commonly used multiple testing correction procedures, our method is fast, easy to implement (using our publicly available R package), and controls the family-wise error rate even in structured populations. Importantly, we note that the appropriate admixture mapping significance threshold depends on the number of ancestral populations, generations since admixture, and population structure of the sample; as a result, significance thresholds are not, in general, transferable across studies.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

Validation of these guidelines is necessary to ensure quality and implementability. Two validated tools, used for medical guideline appraisal, were chosen to assess the guidelines. The terminology from the GuideLine Implementability Appraisal (GLIA) and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation version  (AGREE II) were adapted for use by veterinarians. A two-phase evaluation approach was conducted. In the first phase of the evaluation, the GLIA tool was used by two specialist veterinary surgeons in clinical practice. The results of this phase were then used to modify the guidelines. In the second phase, the AGREE II tool was used by 6 general practitioners and 6 specialists to appraise the guidelines. In phase 1, the specialist surgeons either agreed or strongly agreed that the guidelines were executable, decidable, valid and novel, and that the guidelines would fit within the process of care. The surgeons were neutral on flexibility and measurability. Additional clarity around one common surgical procedure was added to the guidelines, after which the surgeons agreed that the guidelines were sufficiently flexible. In phase , 12 veterinarians completed the assessment using the AGREE II tool. In all sections the scaled domain score was greater than 70%. The overall quality of the guidelines was given a global scaled score of 76%. This assessment has demonstrated that the guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis for companion animal surgery are valid and appear implementable.© 2019 Australian Veterinary Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443222>Irisin as a Multifunctional Protein: Implications for Health and Certain Diseases.</a></h1><p>Sedentary life style is considered to be an independent risk factor for many disorders, including development of type  diabetes, obesity, immune dysfunction, asthma, and neurological or coronary heart disease. Irisin is released from myocytes during physical activity, and acts as a link between muscles and other tissues and organs. This myokine is produced as a result of proteolytic cleavage of FNDC5 protein present in the membrane of myocytes. Secretion of irisin is regulated by -linked oligosaccharides attached to the protein molecule. The two -glycan molecules, which constitute a significant part of the irisin glycoprotein, regulate the  of adipocytes, which is the most important function of irisin. A receptor specific for irisin has still not been discovered. In some tissues irisin probably acts via integrins, which are widely expressed transmembrane receptors. Many studies have confirmed the multifunctional role of irisin and the beneficial effects of this molecule on body homeostasis. Irisin reduces systemic inflammation, maintains the balance between resorption and bone formation, and modulates metabolic processes and the functioning of the nervous system. It suppresses the expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in obese individuals and attenuates inflammation in adipose tissue. The impact of irisin on cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion has also been demonstrated in numerous studies, which proves its role in carcinogenesis. Owing to these pleiotropic and beneficial properties, irisin may be a potential option to prevent and treat civilization-related diseases which are, nowadays, considered to be the major health problems in Western societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208534>Leuconostoc citreum TR116: In-situ production of mannitol in sourdough and its application to reduce sugar in burger buns.</a></h1><p>A marketing study revealed that commercially available burger buns can contain up to 10% (w/w) of added sugar. In order to reduce sugar and maintaining the product quality at the same time, functional ingredients and alternative sweetening agents have to be incorporated. In this study, the sourdough lactic acid bacteria Leuconostoc citreum TR116, selected for its ability to produce high amounts of mannitol, was used to produce wheat sourdough and its biochemical characteristics (cell count, pH, TTA, sugar- and acid profile, as well as mannitol production) were monitored over 48 h. The so produced sourdough was then incorporated, as a functional ingredient, into a sugar reduced burger bun system and the quality characteristics of the dough and the final product were determined. Sourdough incorporation counteract the negative effects of sugar reduction on dough properties and resulted in the same viscoelastic properties (0.423 ± 0.008) and gluten-network-development (PMT: 160 ± 12.6 s; TM: 44.0 ± .6 BU) as the full-sugar control dough. Furthermore, the investigation of specific volume, crumb hardness and chewiness revealed no significant differences between sugar reduced sourdough burger buns and its control. It is noteworthy that sourdough contributed to  reaction resulting in darker crumb and crust colour (-8.%; -9.6%) and it extended microbial shelf life of the burger buns significantly (+3.5 days). Sensory evaluation showed no significant differences in sweetness and sourness between sugar reduced buns containing sourdough and the full-sugar control. In conclusion, the incorporation of mannitol-rich sourdough fermented by Leuconostoc citreum TR116 represents a novel technological approach in the field of sugar reduction and showed high potential as a functional ingredient to ameliorate the losses of important quality parameters. Especially sourdough containing higher amounts of mannitol and lower amounts of lactate improved significantly the dough and burger bun quality.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Development of beige adipocytes ( of WAT) increases energy expenditure and could be a promising strategy for obesity management. This study aimed to investigate the effects of phytoestrogen genistein (GEN) on white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation,  and hepatic lipogenesis in ovariectomized rats with high-fat diet (HFD) and further explore the underlying mechanism. Female Wistar rats received ovariectomy (Ovx) and HFD (45% fat) and then were administered with 17β-estradiol (E2, 3 times/week, subcutaneously) or GEN (15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg, gavage, once daily) for 4 weeks. Administration of GEN decreased Ovx-induced body weight gain and adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity as well as increased insulin signaling p-IRS1 and p-AKT in retroperitoneal WAT. Adipocyte hypertrophy and production of proinflammatory cytokines MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6 were reduced by GEN. It also suppressed the activation of NF-κB pathway evidenced by attenuation of p65 and phospho-IκB levels. Additionally, GEN elevated myokine irisin and promoted WAT  by increasing UCP-1, PRDM-16, PGC-1α and CIDEA proteins and Ppargc1a, Ucp-1 and Tbx-1 mRNA in inguinal WAT which is associated with up-regulation of nuclear estrogen receptor-α. Plasma levels of triglyceride and cholesterol were reduced by GEN treatment accompanied with inhibition of lipogenic proteins (p-ACC, SREBP-1, FAS and CD36) in the liver. Long-term treatment with GEN attenuated estrogen-deficiency-induced obesity, WAT inflammation and hepatic lipogenesis and promoted the induction of WAT .

This study analyzed the long-term outcomes of elbow release and tricepsplasty in a series of children with arthrogryposis at a tertiary institution.Medical records of patients with arthrogryposis who underwent elbow release and tricepsplasty from 1993 to 2015, with at least  years of follow-up, were reviewed. Collected measures included preoperative elbow passive range of motion (ROM), postoperative elbow passive and active ROM, shoulder passive and active ROM, and Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) scores. Our analysis compared pre- and postoperative follow-up of elbow passive ROM and reviewed PODCI scores with age-adjusted normative values.Seventeen patients (4 female and 13 male) with 24 affected upper extremities (10 left elbow and 14 right elbow) were included in final analysis. Age at final follow-up averaged 11 years (range, 4-20 years), mean age at surgery was .7 years (range, 9.6 months-9.3 years) with mean follow-up by extremity at 8.3 years (range, -18 years). Differences in pre- and post-operative passive elbow ROM were significant for extension, flexion, and total arc of motion. Most parent and self-reported PODCI scores were less than the age-adjusted normal population, except in the domains of Comfort and Pain and Happiness.Long-term follow-up of elbow release and tricepsplasty in patients with arthrogryposis indicates both increased and sustained elbow flexion and arc of motion. Although PODCI scores were lower compared with the age-adjusted norm, pediatric patients with arthrogryposis were just as happy and had no more discomfort than their unaffected age-adjusted norms.Therapeutic IV.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

We investigated factors associated with T2D remission and relapse after RYGB.Retrospective review of consecutive patients with T2D who underwent RYGB between 1993 and 2017. T2D remission was defined as medications discontinuation and/or HbA1c<6.5%; relapse was defined as recurrent medication use and/or HbA1c≥6.5%. Independent correlates of T2D remission and relapse were identified using logistic regression.621 patients (aged 46.7±10.6 years; 30% on insulin; BMI 49.8±8.3 kg/m) had at least one-year follow-up. Median follow-up was 4.9 (range 1-23.6) years. Prevalence of T2D remission was 74% at one year, 73% from one to three years, 63% between 3 and 10 years, and 47% beyond 10 years. 93% of remissions occurred within 3 years of RYGB, 25% relapsed. The median (IQR) time to relapse was 5.3 (3-7.8) years after remission. Higher one-year percentage total body weight (%TBW) loss, lack of preoperative insulin use, and younger age at surgery were independently associated with T2D remission. Preoperative insulin use, lower %TBW loss at one year, and greater %TBW gain after one year were independently associated with T2D relapse.This longitudinal retrospective analysis shows that preoperative insulin use and age, one-year weight loss, and regain after that influence T2D remission and relapse following RYGB. Referring patients at a younger age, before insulin is needed, and optimizing both weight loss and weight maintenance after RYGB may improve the rates and durability of T2D remission.Copyright © 2019.

The magnitude of the rise (all infusions, RBCs, and asanguinous) correlates positively with in-hospital mortality (p < 0.01) and hospital length of stay (p < 0.01). The duration of RBC storage was not statistically correlated with the magnitude of rise in the population studied. Mean infusion volume was greater for RBC (vs. asanguinous) infusions, but volume adjustment of MPAP values did not alter the pattern or statistical significance of the results.Analysis of retrospectively collected data suggests that transfusion of RBC-containing fluids results in a sustained elevation of MPAP.

Sensory loss impacts on older people's ability to participate in their communities and their quality of life. This study investigates the prevalence of vision loss, hearing loss, and dual sensory loss (combined vision and hearing loss) in an older adult Chinese population and describes the relationships between these sensory losses and demographic factors, use of glasses and hearing aids, unmet needs, and impacts on social participation. The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study is a population-based longitudinal survey conducted since 2011. The 2013 dataset for people aged 60 and over was used in this study. Items analyzed included demographic data (age, gender, education, rurality, and SES), self-reported ratings of vision (including legally blind, excellent-poor long, and short distance vision and the use and frequency of wearing glasses), hearing (excellent-poor hearing and the use of hearing aids), dual sensory loss (both poor/fair vision and hearing), and social participation. Of the sample, 80.% reported poor/fair vision, 64.9% reported poor/fair hearing, and 57.% had poor/fair vision and hearing. Few respondents (10%) wore glasses regularly and 20.1% wore glasses from time to time. Only 0.8% of respondents wore hearing aids although the proportion with hearing loss was high (64.9%). The proportion of unmet needs for glasses and hearing aids was 54.9 and 63.9%, respectively. Low socio-economic status (SES), poor education, and rurality were significantly associated with the prevalence of poor/fair vision and hearing, the use of glasses and hearing aids and the unmet needs of glasses/hearing aids. Poor/fair vision and/or hearing, and the unmet needs for glasses/hearing aids were significantly and negatively associated with social participation. Sensory loss is a significant health issue for older Chinese people that impacts on their social participation. Training primary care health professionals in identification and rehabilitation approaches is needed as well as increasing the numbers of vision and hearing specialists working in the field. Providing information on sensory loss and the use of aids to older adults will also help improve older adult's quality of life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509935>Black Raspberry (  Miquel) Promotes  of Preadipocytes and Inguinal White Adipose Tissue in Cold-Induced Mice.</a></h1><p>The alteration of white adipose tissue (WAT) "", a change of white into beige fat, has been considered as a new therapeutic strategy to treat obesity. In this study, we investigated the  effect of black raspberry ( Miquel) using in vitro and in vivo models. Black raspberry water extract (BRWE) treatment inhibited lipid accumulation in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and zebrafish. To evaluate the thermogenic activity, BRWE was orally administered for  weeks, and then, the mice were placed in a 4 °C environment. As a result, BRWE treatment increased rectal temperature and inguinal WAT (iWAT) thermogenesis by inducing the expression of beige fat specific markers such as PR domain zinc-finger protein 16 (PRDM16), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), and t-box protein 1 (TBX1) in cold-exposed mice. Furthermore, ellagic acid (EA), a constituent of BRWE, markedly promoted beige specific markers: UCP1, PGC1α, TBX1, and nuclear respiratory factor 1 in beige differentiation media (DM)-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our findings indicate that BRWE can promote beige differentiation/activation, and EA is the active compound responsible for such effect.

Heme  concentrations are low (<1 pmol L) in iron limited phytoplankton in cultures and in the field. Here, we determined heme  in marine particulate material (>0.7 μm) from the North Atlantic Ocean (GEOVIDE cruise - GEOTRACES section GA01), which spanned several biogeochemical regimes. We examined the relationship between heme  abundance and the microbial community composition, and its utility for mapping iron limited phytoplankton. Heme  concentrations ranged from 0.16 to 5.1 pmol L (median = .0 pmol L,  = 62) in the surface mixed layer (SML) along the cruise track, driven mainly by variability in biomass. However, in the Irminger Basin, the lowest heme  levels (SML: median = 0.53 pmol L,  = 12) were observed, whilst the biomass was highest (particulate organic carbon, median = 14. μmol L,  = 25; chlorophyll : median = .0 nmol L,  = 23) pointing to regulatory mechanisms of the heme  pool for growth conservation. Dissolved iron (DFe) was not depleted (SML: median = 0.38 nmol L,  = 11) in the Irminger Basin, but large diatoms ( sp.) dominated. Hence, heme  depletion and regulation is likely to occur during bloom progression when phytoplankton class-dependent absolute iron requirements exceed the available ambient concentration of DFe. Furthermore, high heme  concentrations found in the Iceland Basin and Labrador Sea (median = 3.4 pmol L,  = 20), despite having similar DFe concentrations to the Irminger Basin, were attributed to an earlier growth phase of the extant phytoplankton populations. Thus, heme  provides a snapshot of the cellular activity  and could both be used as indicator of iron limitation and contribute to understanding phytoplankton adaptation mechanisms to changing iron supplies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31107292>Prospects for pharmacotherapies to treat alcohol use disorder: an update on recent human studies.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to provide an update on medication development efforts for alcohol use disorder (AUD) by reviewing recently published (past  years) human studies that evaluated medications' effects on alcohol-related outcomes.Forty-five publications were found suitable for this review. A variety of compounds have been tested in the past  years as potential pharmacological options for AUD, including medications that act on multiple targets (topiramate, aripiprazole, quetiapine), calcium channels (gabapentin), gamma-Aminobutyric acid receptors (baclofen, diazepam), glutamate receptors (ifenprodil, memantine, glycine), nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (varenicline, mecamylamine), α1 adrenergic receptors (prazosin, doxazosin), neuroendocrine pathways (oxytocin, a vasopressin receptor 1b antagonist, a ghrelin receptor inverse agonist) and others (samidorphan, ibudilast, N-acetylcysteine, citoline). Important findings and limitations regarding the effects of these medications on alcohol-related outcomes are discussed.There is a critical need to increase the armamentarium of medications for AUD.

A prescribing guideline (i.e. recommended best practice for writing prescriptions) developed by the Australian poultry veterinarians exists. However, it is not a prescribing guideline detailing treatments for the commonly observed bacterial diseases in commercial poultry.An online survey was deployed to all registered veterinarians and members of the Australian Veterinary Poultry Association to identify prescribing behaviours for the most frequently observed bacterial diseases of poultry.A total of 39 survey responses were received. Most surveys were started but not completed; 13 (33%) were completed with 18 (46%) containing some information on prescribing. The most frequent treatment responses were for Escherichia coli in both layers and broilers, chronic respiratory disease (CRD), fowl cholera and spotty liver in layers and necrotic enteritis in broilers. Treatments described were for products registered for poultry use, within the recommended label dose and duration of treatment (Tables 1, ). Unsurprisingly, tetracyclines and amoxycillin, followed by lincomycin and trimethoprim sulfonamide products were the most frequently reported treatment options. Inappropriate treatments were reported for salmonellosis and one veterinarian recommended the use of enrofloxacin for the treatment of fowl cholera.Information provided by respondents will enable the initial development of prescribing guidelines for both commercial and small poultry flocks. Importantly, it identified less than optimal prescribing behaviour for some diseases, a reliance on one class of antibiotic more than others and a failure to utilise all antimicrobial classes potentially available for treatment. Critically, the survey identified a lack of treatment options for bacterial disease in poultry. The most important bacterial diseases of poultry remain the same; effective alternatives for antibiotic treatment are required and old diseases, thought once gone, are reinventing themselves as problems for the future. Surveys of prescribing behaviours are essential for identifying diseases of high priority, changes in treatments and response to treatment and to identify areas for targeted antimicrobial stewardship, and research needs.© 2019 Australian Veterinary Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31006007>Plasma oxylipins respond in a linear dose-response manner with increased intake of EPA and DHA: results from a randomized controlled trial in healthy humans.</a></h1><p>The health effects of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are partly mediated by their oxidized metabolites, i.e., eicosanoids and other oxylipins. Some intervention studies have demonstrated that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) increase systemic concentrations of n-3 PUFA-derived oxylipins and moderately decrease arachidonic acid-derived oxylipins. There is no information on the dose-response of oxylipin concentrations after n-3 PUFA intake.The aim of this study was to quantify oxylipins in human plasma samples from an intervention study in which participants were randomly assigned to different daily intakes of EPA and DHA for 12 mo.Healthy adult men and women with low habitual fish consumption (n = 121) were randomly assigned to receive capsules providing doses of n-3 PUFAs reflecting 3 patterns of consumption of oily fish [1, , or 4 portions/wk with 3.27 g EPA + DHA (1:1., wt:wt) per portion] or placebo. Oxylipins were quantified in plasma after 3 and 12 mo. Relative and absolute changes of individual oxylipins were calculated and concentrations were correlated with the dose and the content of EPA and DHA in blood lipid pools.Seventy-three oxylipins, mostly hydroxy-, dihydroxy-, and epoxy-PUFAs, were quantified in the plasma samples. After 3 and 12 mo a linear increase with dose was observed for all EPA- and DHA-derived oxylipins. Cytochrome-P450-derived anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective epoxy-PUFAs increased linearly with n-3 PUFA dose and showed low interindividual variance (r2 > 0.95). Similarly, 5, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenase-derived hydroxy-PUFAs as well as those formed autoxidatively increased linearly. These include the precursors of so-called specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), e.g., 17-hydroxy-DHA and 18-hydroxy-EPA.Plasma concentrations of biologically active oxylipins derived from n-3 PUFAs, including epoxy-PUFAs and SPM-precursors, increase linearly with elevated intake of EPA and DHA. Interindividual differences in resulting plasma concentrations are low.

The two main types of adipose tissues are the white adipose tissue (WAT) and the brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT primarily stores excess energy, whereas BAT is predominantly responsible for energy expenditure by non-shivering thermogenesis through the mitochondria. WAT in response to appropriate stimuli such as cold exposure and β-adrenergic agonist undergoes  wherein it acts as BAT, which is characterized by the presence of a higher number of mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction in adipocytes has been reported to have strong correlation with metabolic diseases, including obesity and type  diabetes. Dysfunction of mitochondria results in detrimental effects on adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, oxidative capacity, and thermogenesis, which consequently lead to metabolic diseases. Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial function can be improved by using thiazolidinedione, mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, and dietary natural compounds; by performing exercise; and by controlling caloric restriction, thereby maintaining the metabolic homeostasis by inducing adaptive thermogenesis of BAT and  of WAT. In this review, we focus on and summarize the molecular regulation involved in the improvement of mitochondrial function in adipose tissues so that strategies can be developed to treat metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553232>GDF5 Promotes White Adipose Tissue Thermogenesis via p38 MAPK Signaling Pathway.</a></h1><p>Growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) was reported to regulate brown adipogenesis; however, its effects on insulin sensitivity, full metabolic syndrome spectrum, and the thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) have not been elucidated yet. We thus generated fatty acid-binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high-fat diet (HFD) and showed increased insulin sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired  program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor  (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that GDF5 could improve insulin sensitivity and prevent metabolic syndrome, the adaptive thermogenesis in sWAT could mediate the obesity resistance effects of GDF5 in mice and partially resulted in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31438646>Superiority of the Non-Glycosylated Form Over the Glycosylated Form of Irisin in the Attenuation of Adipocytic Meta-Inflammation: A Potential Factor in the Fight Against Insulin Resistance.</a></h1><p>Irisin is an adipomyokine that promotes the  of white adipose tissue and exhibits protective potential against the development of insulin resistance and type  diabetes. In our bodies, it occurs in its glycosylated form (G-IR): its activity is still poorly understood, because the majority of studies have used its non-glycosylated counterpart (nG-IR). Glycosylation can affect protein function: therefore, the present study attempted to compare the actions of both forms of irisin toward inflammatory activation of the main component of adipose tissue. The study was carried out in a coculture of 3T3 adipocytes and RAW 264.7 macrophages maintained in the presence of nG-IR or G-IR. The impact on vitality and the expression and release of key inflammatory mediators important for insulin resistance and diabetes development were assessed. The studies showed that both forms effectively inhibited the expression and release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, macrophage chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, high-mobility group box (HMGB1), leptin, and adiponectin. However, in the case of TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP-1, and HMGB1, the inhibition exerted by nG-IR was more prominent than that by G-IR. In addition, only nG-IR significantly inhibited macrophage migration. Here, nG-IR seemed to be the stronger inhibitor of the development of obesity-related inflammation; however, G-IR also had anti-inflammatory potential.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191804>Irisin Contributes to the Hepatoprotection of Dexmedetomidine during Intestinal Ischemia/Reperfusion.</a></h1><p>Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality, is also accompanied with abnormal energy metabolism and liver injury. Irisin, a novel exercise-induced hormone, can regulate adipose  and thermogenesis. The following study investigated the potential role of dexmedetomidine in liver injury during intestinal I/R in rats. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery for 90 min followed by  h of reperfusion. Dexmedetomidine or irisin-neutralizing antibody was intravenously administered for 1 h before surgery. The results demonstrated that severe intestine and liver injuries occurred during intestinal I/R as evidenced by pathological scores and an apparent increase in serum diamine oxidase (DAO), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In addition, the hepatic irisin, cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and NLRP3 inflammasome components (including NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1), protein expressions, apoptotic index, reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) , and interleukin- (IL-) 6 levels increased; however, the serum irisin level and hepatic Bcl- protein expression and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased after intestinal I/R. Interestingly, dexmedetomidine could reduce the above listed changes and increase the irisin levels in plasma and the liver in I/R rats. Dexmedetomidine-mediated protective effects on liver injury and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during intestinal I/R were partially abrogated via irisin-neutralizing antibody treatment. The results suggest that irisin might contribute to the hepatoprotection of dexmedetomidine during intestinal ischemia/reperfusion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176253>Electrochemical properties of the interaction between cytochrome c and a hematite nanowire array electrode.</a></h1><p>We investigate the interaction of horse heart cytochrome c (cyt c) with hematite nanowire array electrodes by cyclic voltammetry to study the electron transfer between redox active proteins and mineral surfaces. Using this model system, we quantify electron transfer rates between cyt c and hematite under varying electric potential and pH conditions. The results are consistent with two cyt c conformations adsorbed at the hematite surface: the native and a partially unfolded form. The partially unfolded protein maintained redox activity, but at a lower redox potential than the native protein. Adsorption of cyt c allowed direct electron transfer between cyt c and hematite, with an interfacial electron transfer rate, k°, of 0.4 s for the native form and 0.55 s for the partially unfolded protein at pH 7.07. At pH 4.66, protein adsorption decreased compared to neutral pH and the fraction of partially unfolded protein increased. Additionally, the diffusion controlled electron transfer rate between hematite and the electron shuttling compound anthraquinone-,6-disulfonate (AQDS) was determined to be k° = 8.0·10 cm·s at pH 7.07. Modulation of electron transfer rates as a result of conformational changes by redox active proteins has broad implications for describing chemical transformations at biological-mineral interfaces.Copyright © 2019.

A crucial clinical question is whether cerebral microbleeds indicate patients with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack in whom the rate of future intracranial haemorrhage is likely to exceed that of recurrent ischaemic stroke when treated with antithrombotic drugs. We therefore aimed to establish whether a large burden of cerebral microbleeds or particular anatomical patterns of cerebral microbleeds can identify ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack patients at higher absolute risk of intracranial haemorrhage than ischaemic stroke.We did a pooled analysis of individual patient data from cohort studies in adults with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Cohorts were eligible for inclusion if they prospectively recruited adult participants with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack; included at least 50 participants; collected data on stroke events over at least 3 months follow-up; used an appropriate MRI sequence that is sensitive to magnetic susceptibility; and documented the number and anatomical distribution of cerebral microbleeds reliably using consensus criteria and validated scales. Our prespecified primary outcomes were a composite of any symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage or ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, and symptomatic ischaemic stroke. We registered this study with the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews, number CRD42016036602.Between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 1, 2018, we identified 344 studies. After exclusions for ineligibility or declined requests for inclusion, 20 322 patients from 38 cohorts (over 35 225 patient-years of follow-up; median 1·34 years [IQR 0·19-·44]) were included in our analyses. The adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] comparing patients with cerebral microbleeds to those without was 1·35 (95% CI 1·20-1·50) for the composite outcome of intracranial haemorrhage and ischaemic stroke; ·45 (1·82-3·29) for intracranial haemorrhage and 1·23 (1·08-1·40) for ischaemic stroke. The aHR increased with increasing cerebral microbleed burden for intracranial haemorrhage but this effect was less marked for ischaemic stroke (for five or more cerebral microbleeds, aHR 4·55 [95% CI 3·08-6·72] for intracranial haemorrhage vs 1·47 [1·19-1·80] for ischaemic stroke; for ten or more cerebral microbleeds, aHR 5·52 [3·36-9·05] vs 1·43 [1·07-1·91]; and for ≥20 cerebral microbleeds, aHR 8·61 [4·69-15·81] vs 1·86 [1·23-1·82]). However, irrespective of cerebral microbleed anatomical distribution or burden, the rate of ischaemic stroke exceeded that of intracranial haemorrhage (for ten or more cerebral microbleeds, 64 ischaemic strokes [95% CI 48-84] per 1000 patient-years vs 27 intracranial haemorrhages [17-41] per 1000 patient-years; and for ≥20 cerebral microbleeds, 73 ischaemic strokes [46-108] per 1000 patient-years vs 39 intracranial haemorrhages [21-67] per 1000 patient-years).In patients with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, cerebral microbleeds are associated with a greater relative hazard (aHR) for subsequent intracranial haemorrhage than for ischaemic stroke, but the absolute risk of ischaemic stroke is higher than that of intracranial haemorrhage, regardless of cerebral microbleed presence, antomical distribution, or burden.British Heart Foundation and UK Stroke Association.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Descriptive statistics and chi-square statistics were used to examine line item concordance, overall and by services groups (survivorship vs. other oncology service). Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of service delivery group on the concordance.Institutional compliance with the ASCO template was very high; 76% of the 66 line items were present in at least 75% of the delivered TS/SCPs. There was a significantly higher rate of concordance for TS/SCPs provided by the survivorship service (83% vs. 66%, P = 0.006). TS/SCPs provided by the survivorship service were nearly twice as likely to be concordant with ASCO template (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.77-.00) compared to those by other service groups.Use of the electronic medical record to auto-populate information was instrumental in achieving a high rate of concordance.

In this study, we constructed two vectors, pChG-gTs and pChG-gTa, expressing sense and antisense tyrosinase gene of L. edodes, respectively, using promoters derived from the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. The host strain SR-1 of L. edodes was selected because of its fast growth, high protoplast yield, and high regeneration rate. Upon transformation of the host strain SR-1 with the pChG-gTs vector, a clone with 3.6-fold and 14.5-fold higher tyrosinase activity in vegetative mycelia and in fresh gills, respectively, than that of the host strain was obtained from nine transformants. Similarly, two clones containing the pChG-gTa vector with effectively repressed tyrosinase gene expression in vegetative mycelia and gills during the late stage of post-harvest preservation of fruiting bodies were obtained from 10 transformants. However, it remained unclear whether repression of the tyrosinase gene prevented gill , as the host strain also showed less  than a commercial strain. Thus, this study highlights the usefulness of the pChG vector in expressing homologous enzyme coding genes in the vegetative mycelia and fruiting bodies of L. edodes.Copyright © 2018 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

Coffee by-products extracts (31-500 μg mL) and pure phenolics (100 μmol L) reduced lipid accumulation and increased mitochondrial activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Also reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase- and diminished secretion of pro-inflammatory factors in LPS-stimulated RAW2643.7 macrophages. Cytokine release diminished (tumor necrosis factor α: 23-57%; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1: 42-60%; interleukin-6: 30-39%) and adiponectin increased (7-13- fold) in adipocytes treated with macrophage-conditioned media. ROS scavenging and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α pathway counteracted mitochondrial dysfunction. Increases in insulin receptor (1.4 to 4-fold), phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( to 3-fold) and protein kinase B (1.3 to 3-fold) phosphorylation, in conjunction with a decrease in serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, evoked glucose transporter 4 translocation (8-15-fold) and glucose uptake (44-85%).

Existing literature shows that Dual Sensory Loss (DSL) is a prevalent condition amongst older adults. In China, it has been estimated that 57.% of the population experience DSL. Based on a small number of research papers, it has been identified that DSL influences mental health and wellbeing. The aims of this study were to explore the relationship between DSL and mental health and wellbeing in a sample of older adults residing in China; and investigate whether the comorbidities of functional dependency [Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)] and chronic diseases influence the impacts of DSL on mental health and wellbeing.  The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study Wave , 2013 data collection of a sample of people aged 60 years and over ( = 8,268) was used in this study. The sensory loss variables selected for analysis included a combined variable of self-reported vision and hearing loss (DSL). Mental health was measured by depression, and general wellbeing was measured by life satisfaction. In addition, chronic diseases, and limitations in IADL and ADL were used to test how their comorbidities with DSL influence mental health and wellbeing. Results were analyzed descriptively and using regression and modeling techniques.  DSL was significantly and positively associated with advanced age, having difficulty in any ADL or IADL and experiencing depression and less life satisfaction. The observed negative associations between DSL and mental health or wellbeing, are indirect and could be partially explained by its comorbidity with chronic diseases and relationship to functional limitations. It is recommended that health services in China screen for DSL in older people and develop integrated services to assist with appropriate management and rehabilitation of older people with DSL focusing on both functional and mental health issues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205364>Synthesis, characterization and application of gelatin-carboxymethyl cellulose blend films for preservation of cherry tomatoes and grapes.</a></h1><p>In the present study, gelatin-carboxymethyl cellulose blend film was synthesized, characterized and applied for the first time to preserve cherry tomatoes () and grapes (). Gelatin (Gel) film forming solution was incorporated with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) at three volume per volume (Gel:CMC) ratios, namely 75:25, 50:50 and 25:75. CMC treatment has improved the transparency, tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (EAB), water vapor permeability and oxygen permeability of gelatin films.

Increased SNS outflow promotes fat mobilization, stimulates non-shivering thermogenesis, promotes , and inhibits leptin production. Most of these effects are attributed to norepinephrine activation of the Gs-coupled beta adrenergic receptors located on the surface of the adipocytes. Evidence suggests that other adrenergic receptor subtypes, including the Gi-coupled alpha  adrenergic receptors might also mediate the SNS effects on adipose tissue. However, the impact of acute stimulation of adipocyte Gs and Gi has never been reported.We harness the power of chemogenetics to develop unique mouse models allowing the specific and spatiotemporal stimulation of adipose tissue Gi and Gs signaling. We evaluated the impact of chemogenetic stimulation of these pathways on glucose homeostasis, lipolysis, leptin production, and gene expression.Stimulation of Gs signaling in adipocytes induced rapid and sustained hypoglycemia. These hypoglycemic effects were secondary to increased insulin release, likely consequent to increased lipolysis. Notably, we also observed differences in gene regulation and ex vivo lipolysis in different adipose depots. In contrast, acute stimulation of Gi signaling in adipose tissue did not affect glucose metabolism or lipolysis, but regulated leptin production.Our data highlight the significance of adipose Gs signaling in regulating systemic glucose homeostasis. We also found previously unappreciated heterogeneity across adipose depots following acute stimulation. Together, these results highlight the complex interactions of GPCR signaling in adipose tissue and demonstrate the usefulness of chemogenetic technology to better understand adipocyte function.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Angiotensin converting enzyme  (ACE2) counteracts Ang II/AT1R axis via converting Ang II to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which is known to have an anti-obesity effect. In this study, we hypothesized that ACE2 exerts a strong anti-obesity effect by increasing Ang1-7 levels. We injected intraperitoneally recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) (.0mg/ kg/day) for 28 days to high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity mice. rhACE2 treatment decreased body weight and improved glucose metabolism. Furthermore, rhACE2 increased oxygen consumption and upregulated thermogenesis in HFD-fed mice. In the rhACE2 treatment group, BAT mass increased, accompanied with ameliorated insulin signaling and increased protein levels of UCP-1 and PRDM16. Importantly, subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) mass decreased, concomitant with , which was established by the increase of UCP-1 expression. The  is due to increased H3K27 acetylation via the downregulation of HDAC3 and increased H3K9 acetylation via upregulation of GCN5 and PCAF. These results suggest that rhACE2 exerts anti-obesity effects by stimulating BAT and inducing  in sWAT.

A series of veratric acid derivatives containing benzylidene-hydrazine moieties with different substitutions were synthesized and their inhibitory effect on mushroom tyrosinase and free radical scavenging activity were evaluated. The results indicated that N'-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-3,4-dimethoxybenzohydrazide (D5) and N'-(,3-dihydroxybenzylidene)-3,4-dimethoxybenzohydrazide (D12) showed the highest tyrosinase inhibitory activity with IC values of 19.72 ± 1.84 and 20.63 ± 0.79 μM, respectively, that were comparable with the IC value of kojic acid (19.08 ± 1.21 μM). D12 was also a potent radical scavenger with EC value of 0.0097 ± 0.0011 mM. The free radical scavenging activity of D12 was comparable with the standard quercetin. The inhibition kinetic analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plots revealed that compound D5 was a competitive tyrosinase inhibitor. Molecular docking study was carried out for the derivatives demonstrating tyrosinase inhibitory activity. D5 and D12 possessed the most negative estimated free energies of binding in mushroom tyrosinase active site. Therefore, D5 and D12 could be introduced as potent tyrosinase inhibitors that might be promising leads in medicine, cosmetics and food industry.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, both enhancement of adipocyte energy expenditure and inhibition of adipogenesis are viable ways to combat obesity. Using the Ucp1-2A-luciferase reporter animal model previously reported by us as a screening platform, a chemical compound Linifanib was identified as a potent inducer of UCP1 expression in primary inguinal adipocytes in vitro and in vivo. Signal pathway analyses showed that Linifanib promoted adipocyte  by attenuating STAT3 phosphorylation. The effects of Linifanib on adipocyte  were blocked by the compound, SD19, which activates the STAT3 signaling cascade. Linifanib also inhibited adipocyte differentiation, by blocking mitotic clonal expansion, which could be rescued by STAT3 activator. Taken together, our results indicate that Linifanib might serve as a potential drug for the treatment of obesity.Copyright © 2019.

Moreover, residue generation by rice industries is another challenge. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of microwave irradiation during soaking and gelatinization stages of parboiling rice. Processing time, colorimetric profile, broken and nongelatinized grains, sucrose and glucose content, free 5-hydroxymethyl--furfural, and residual phosphorus were evaluated. As the soaking and gelatinization times during microwave treatments increased, the colorimetric parameters increased; however, the values were lower than those with the conventional process. Regardless of soaking time, a decrease in broken and nongelatinized grains was obtained by using the lowest steaming time (5 min). Additionally, lower residual phosphorus content was found in soaking water (10 and 20 min) when using microwave irradiation. Under favorable conditions, a reduction in the levels of broken and nongelatinized grains, residual phosphorus, and color changes was observed, indicating that microwave irradiation may be more beneficial than conventional parboiling. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Parboiling requires a high volume of water and soaking time, which leads to high costs, underutilization of infrastructures, and high residue in the water after processing. The rapid parboiling process involves the use of microwaves during the soaking and gelatinization stages. The main advantages of the microwave parboiling process include reduced processing time, ranging from 83% to 95%, higher gelatinization, greater yield, reduced darkening, and reduced residual phosphorus in the effluents by 60%. This report can aid industries in streamlining their processes, thereby providing a high-quality, lower cost, and environmentally safe product.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30729079>Expression analysis of the polyphenol oxidase gene in response to signaling molecules, herbivory and wounding in antisense transgenic tobacco plants.</a></h1><p>We provide evidence that the expression of the  gene was significantly reduced in response to wounding, MeJ and herbivory in transgenic tobacco under wound-inducible RGLP2 promoter in an anti-sense orientation.Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes play an important role in plant defense mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses. In the present study, a 655 bp core sequence of the potato  gene was placed under the control of wound-inducible RGLP2 promoter in an anti-sense direction to evaluate its potential effects during biotic ('s infestation) and various abiotic (wounding, MeJ, ABA) stresses. Transcriptional profiling of  gene by real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in transgenic tobacco revealed a significant suppression (3.5-fold) of  in response to wounding than control plants after 24 h. In response to MeJ at different concentrations (100 µM and 200 µM), the  expression was greatly down-regulated by 4.7-fold after 6 h at 100 µM MeJ, and a non-significant expression was observed with ABA treatment. Moreover, significant levels of  reduction (sixfolds) was found in whitefly feeding assay indicating that expression of potato  in an anti-sense orientation had down-regulated the  activity. This down-regulation of  by wounding, MeJ and whitefly infestation clearly links the specific expression of  in biotic and abiotic stresses. In the future,  gene suppression in transgenic plants using anti-sense potato  gene construct can be used to inhibit enzymatic  in fruits and vegetables, e.g., potato.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30885775>MRE11 as a Predictive Biomarker of Outcome After Radiation Therapy in Bladder Cancer.</a></h1><p>Organ-confined muscle-invasive bladder cancer is treated with cystectomy or bladder preservation techniques, including radiation therapy. There are currently no biomarkers to inform management decisions and aid patient choice. Previously we showed high levels of MRE11 protein, assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), predicted outcome after radiation therapy, but not cystectomy. Therefore, we sought to develop the MRE11 IHC assay for clinical use and define its relationship to clinical outcome in samples from  major clinical trials.Samples from the BCON and BC2001 randomized controlled trials and a cystectomy cohort were stained using automated IHC methods and scored for MRE11 in 3 centers in the United Kingdom.Despite step-wise creation of scoring cards and standard operating procedures for staining and interpretation, there was poor intercenter scoring agreement (kappa, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.47). No significant associations between MRE11 scores and cause-specific survival were identified in BCON (n = 132) and BC2001 (n = 221) samples. Reoptimized staining improved agreement between scores from BCON tissue microarrays (n = 116), but MRE11 expression was not prognostic for cause-specific survival.Manual IHC scoring of MRE11 was not validated as a reproducible biomarker of radiation-based bladder preservation success. There is a need for automated quantitative methods or a reassessment of how DNA-damage response relates to clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The changes in drying rate, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, and β-carotene contents as well as antioxidant activity and colour in pre-treatment and hot air-dried apricot samples were investigated. PEF and heat treatments increased the drying rate of apricots. PEF treatments had no effect on the PPO activity and decreased the POD activity (p < 0.05). HPEF2 treatment retained more β-carotene, higher antioxidant activity and suffered less  during processing. Overall, the results indicate that combining sulphite treatment with PEF produces dried apricots with more β-carotene and antioxidant activity, and better colour.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, delivery of medication in drinking water cannot be assumed to deliver an equal dose to all animals in a group. There is substantial between-animal variability in systemic exposure to an antimicrobial (i.e. the antimicrobial concentration in plasma), resulting in under-dosing or over-dosing of many pigs. Three sources of this between-animal variability during a water medication dosing event are differences in: (1) concentration of the active constituent of the antimicrobial product in water available to pigs at drinking appliances in each pen over time, () medicated water consumption patterns of pigs in each pen over time, and (3) pharmacokinetics (i.e. oral bioavailability, volume of distribution and clearance between pigs and within pigs over time). It is essential that factors operating on each farm that influence the range of systemic exposures of pigs to an antimicrobial are factored into antimicrobial administration regimens to reduce under-dosing and over-dosing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30807212>Novel regulatory roles of carboxylesterase 3 in lipid metabolism and  in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes.</a></h1><p>The role of carboxylesterase 3 (Ces3) in the lipolysis of adipocytes has been overlooked, as  major lipolytic enzymes, hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase, play more powerful roles in lipolysis. In this study, we explored the effects of Ces3 in lipid metabolism by activating and inhibiting, as well as silencing, Ces3-encoding gene in 3T3-L1 cell model. Our results demonstrated that activation of Ces3 increased adipogenesis, and attenuated lipogenesis, whereas it promoted lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. In addition, activated Ces3 led to enhanced expression of core fat  marker genes and proteins, suggesting that Ces3 may play a pivotal role in fat  and thermogenesis. In contrast, deficiency of  nullified the  effect in white adipocytes, along with decreased adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Interestingly, the expression pattern of adipose triglyceride lipase was in line with Ces3, whereas hormone-sensitive lipase was independently regulated irrespective of Ces3 expression levels, suggesting that Ces3 may play an important and compensatory role in the breakdown of triglycerides in white adipocytes. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that activation of Ces3 contributes in the  of white adipocytes, and maintains a balance in lipid metabolism, which could be a potential strategy in fighting against obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291761>Identification and analysis of cell wall glycan epitopes and polyphenol oxidase in pawpaw ( [L.] Dunal) fruit pulp as affected by high pressure processing and refrigerated storage.</a></h1><p>This research explores the cell wall composition and polyphenol oxidase activity of two pawpaw () fruit varieties, Susquehanna and Green River Belle, that were subjected to high pressure processing and 45 days of refrigerated storage. We hypothesize that high pressure processing may inhibit enzymatic action responsible for pawpaw's deleterious postharvest tissue softening and . Glycome profiling uses mAb groupings that recognize 19 groups of glycan epitopes present in most major classes of cell wall glycans and was used to determine cell wall composition. Results show that both varieties have typical type I primary cell walls of flowering dicots.

However, little is known about the effects of HA and UV-C treatments on volatiles changes in peach fruit during cold storage. In this study, peaches were treated with HA at 40 °C for 4 h or irradiated with UV-C lamp (1.5 kJ/m), and then stored at 1 °C for 35 days plus 3 days of shelf life at 20 °C. Results showed that HA and UV-C suppressed chilling injury significantly, exhibiting lower internal  index. Also, the two treatments enhanced emissions of esters and lactones in peaches by increasing enzymes of alcohol acyltransferase (AAT), fatty acid desaturase (FAD) acetyl coenzyme A transferase (ACX). These suggested that the increase of fruity note aromas in peaches by the two treatments is closely associated with aroma-related metabolism (LOX pathway and lactone pathway).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, the effect of combination treatment on juice quality was determined by measuring the changes in color, pH, non-enzymatic  index, and total phenolic content. A mixed cocktail of the three pathogens was inoculated into apple juice, followed by treatment with US (40 kHz) alone, FA (0.05, 0.1, and 0.15%) alone, and a combination of US and FA for 1, , 3, 4, and 5 min. Combined US and 0.15% FA treatment for 5 min achieved 5.67, 6.35, and 3.47 log reductions in E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes, respectively, with the 1.55, .37, and 0.57 log CFU reductions attributed to the synergistic effect. Although the pH value slightly decreased as FA increased, there were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in color values,  indices, and phenolic content between untreated and treated samples. To identify the mechanism of this synergistic bactericidal action, membrane integrity, malfunctions in the membrane efflux pump, and intracellular enzyme activity were measured. The analyses confirmed that damage to the cell envelope (membrane integrity and efflux pump) was strongly related to the synergistic microbial inactivation. These results suggest that simultaneous application of US treatment and FA is a novel method for ensuring the microbial safety of apple juice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of using a -interval, forced-choice, observer-based method for individuals considered to be difficult-to-test using behavioral audiometric assessments. Method Participants were 5 children with motor and developmental impairments, ages 5-15 years ( = 11.6,  = 4.6). The functional abilities of all participants were greater than   below the mean, as measured by the Vineland-II Parent Caregiver Rating Form. Participants listened to either a male talker saying the word "playground" or a 1000-Hz warble tone, presented via an insert earphone or a sound field speaker. An observer, blind to signal presentation, selected 1 of  temporal intervals, determining which contained the signal based only on participant behavior. Criterion was reached when the observer correctly identified the interval containing the signal for 8 of the last 10 trials. Results An 80%-correct criterion was met for all participants, suggesting feasibility for use in children with motor or developmental impairment. Two participants were tested using an adaptive tracking procedure; a reliable threshold estimate was obtained for both children. This method offers promise for children who have difficulty performing behavioral audiometric assessments currently in use clinically.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30957593>A case of ocular cystinosis associated with two potentially severe CTNS mutations.</a></h1><p>Ocular cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by one severe and one mild mutation in the CTNS gene. It is characterised by cystine deposition within the cornea and conjunctiva however, the kidneys are not affected. We report a case of ocular cystinosis caused by two potentially severe CTNS mutations and discuss the possible mechanism of renal sparing.This is an observational case report of the proband and her unaffected relatives. All subjects underwent ophthalmic examination, whilst in the proband, In vivo laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to demonstrate cystine crystals within her corneas and conjunctiva. Genetic diagnosis was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the proband and the segregation of the mutations was established in her relatives. RT-PCR of leukocyte RNA was undertaken to determine if aberrant splicing of the CTNS gene was taking place Results: The proband was found to have cystine crystals limited to the anterior corneal stroma and the conjunctiva. Sequencing of the proband's CTNS gene found her to be a compound heterozygote for a 27bp deletion in exon8/intron 8 (c.559_561 + 24del) and a novel c.635C>T variant in exon 9 that is predicted be pathogenic and to result in the substitution of alanine with valine at amino acid position 212 (p.Ala212Val), which is within the 3 transmembrane spanning domain of the CTNS protein. Examination of the proband's leukocyte RNA failed to demonstrate any aberrant CTNS gene splicing.We present a case of ocular cystinosis caused by two potentially severe CTNS gene mutations. The lack of renal involvement may be due to localised (ocular) aberrant CTNS RNA splicing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577875>Isoniazid Preventive Therapy in HIV-Infected Pregnant and Postpartum Women.</a></h1><p>The safety, efficacy, and appropriate timing of isoniazid therapy to prevent tuberculosis in pregnant women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are receiving antiretroviral therapy are unknown.In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned pregnant women with HIV infection to receive isoniazid preventive therapy for 28 weeks, initiated either during pregnancy (immediate group) or at week 12 after delivery (deferred group). Mothers and infants were followed through week 48 after delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of treatment-related maternal adverse events of grade 3 or higher or permanent discontinuation of the trial regimen because of toxic effects. The noninferiority margin was an upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in the rate of the primary outcome of less than 5 events per 100 person-years.A total of 956 women were enrolled. A primary outcome event occurred in 72 of 477 women (15.1%) in the immediate group and in 73 of 479 (15.%) in the deferred group (incidence rate, 15.03 and 14.93 events per 100 person-years, respectively; rate difference, 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.77 to 4.98, which met the criterion for noninferiority). Two women in the immediate group and 4 women in the deferred group died (incidence rate, 0.40 and 0.78 per 100 person-years, respectively; rate difference, -0.39; 95% CI, -1.33 to 0.56); all deaths occurred during the postpartum period, and 4 were from liver failure ( of the women who died from liver failure had received isoniazid [1 in each group]). Tuberculosis developed in 6 women (3 in each group); the incidence rate was 0.60 per 100 person-years in the immediate group and 0.59 per 100 person-years in the deferred group (rate difference, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.94 to 0.96). There was a higher incidence in the immediate group than in the deferred group of an event included in the composite adverse pregnancy outcome (stillbirth or spontaneous abortion, low birth weight in an infant, preterm delivery, or congenital anomalies in an infant) (23.6% vs. 17.0%; difference, 6.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.8 to 11.9).The risks associated with initiation of isoniazid preventive therapy during pregnancy appeared to be greater than those associated with initiation of therapy during the postpartum period.

Here, we examined the physiological and metabolic effects of the deficiency of these two bile acid receptors on hepatic metabolism and injury in mice. Fxr/Tgr5 double knockout mice (DKO) were generated for metabolic phenotyping. Male DKO mice fed a chow diet had reduced liver lipid levels but increased serum cholesterol levels. Liver cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) activity and sterol 12α-hydroxylase mRNA levels were induced, while ileum FXR target genes were suppressed in DKO mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Bile acid pool size was increased in DKO mice, with increased taurocholic acid and decreased tauromuricholic acids. RNA sequencing analysis of the liver transcriptome revealed that bile acid synthesis and fibrosis gene expression levels are increased in chow-fed DKO mice compared to WT mice and that the top regulated pathways are involved in steroid/cholesterol biosynthesis, liver cirrhosis, and connective tissue disease. Cholestyramine treatment further induced Cyp7a1 mRNA and protein in DKO mice and increased bile acid pool size, while cholic acid also induced Cyp7a1 in DKO mice, suggesting impaired bile acid feedback regulation. A Western diet containing 0.% cholesterol increased oxidative stress and markers of liver fibrosis but not hepatic steatosis in DKO mice. Conclusion: FXR and TGR5 play critical roles in protecting the liver from inflammation and fibrosis, and deficiency of both of these bile acid receptors in mice increased cholic acid synthesis and the bile acid pool, liver fibrosis, and inflammation; FXR and TGR5 DKO mice may be a model for liver fibrosis.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603974>Cutaneous sarcoidosis presenting as a cutaneous horn.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847153>Effects of 1-methylcyclopropene on the quality attributes of harvested Chinese mushroom () fruiting bodies.</a></h1><p>The effects of paper containing different concentrations of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on the quality of Chinese mushrooms were investigated.

However, there is no evidence for an acute effect of exercise supporting this statement and the metabolic distinct enantiomers of BAIBA were not taken into account. Concerning these enantiomers, there is at this point no consensus about resting concentrations of plasma R- and S-BAIBA. Additionally, a polymorphism of the alanine - glyoxylate aminotransferase  (AGXT2) gene (rs37369) is known to have a high impact on baseline levels of total BAIBA, but the effect on the enantiomers is unknown. Fifteen healthy recreationally active subjects, with different genotypes of rs37369, participated in a randomized crossover trial where they exercised for 1 h at 40% of P or remained at rest. Plasma samples were analyzed for R- and S-BAIBA using dual column HPLC-fluorescence. The plasma concentration of baseline R-BAIBA was 67 times higher compared to S-BAIBA (1734 ± 821 vs. 29.3 ± 7.8 nM). Exercise induced a 13 and 20% increase in R-BAIBA and S-BAIBA, respectively. The AGXT2 rs37369 genotype strongly affected baseline levels of R-BAIBA, but did not have an impact on baseline S-BAIBA. We demonstrate that BAIBA should not be treated as one molecule, given (1) the markedly uneven distribution of its enantiomers in human plasma favoring R-BAIBA, and () their different metabolic source, as evidenced by the AGXT2 polymorphism only affecting R-BAIBA. The proposed function in organ cross talk is supported by the current data and may apply to both enantiomers, but the tissue of origin remains unclear.Copyright © 2019 Stautemas, Van Kuilenburg, Stroomer, Vaz, Blancquaert, Lefevere, Everaert and Derave.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672731>Whole genome sequence analysis of Australian avian pathogenic Escherichia coli that carry the class 1 integrase gene.</a></h1><p>Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) cause widespread economic losses in poultry production and are potential zoonotic pathogens.

FII and FIB repA genes were the predominant (each 93/95, 98 %) plasmid incompatibility groups identified, but those of B/O/K/Z (25/95, 26 %) and I1 (24/95, 25 %) were also identified frequently. Virulence-associated genes (VAGs) carried by ColV and ColBM virulence plasmids, including those encoding protectins [iss (91/95, 96 %), ompT (91/95, 96 %) and traT (90/95, 95 %)], iron-acquisition systems [sitA (88/95, 93 %), etsA (87/95, 92 %), iroN (84/95, 89 %) and iucD/iutA (84/95, 89 %)] and the putative avian haemolysin hylF (91/95, 96 %), featured prominently. Notably, mobile resistance genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones, colistin, extended-spectrum β-lactams and carbapenems were not detected in the genomes of these 95 APEC but carriage of the sulphonamide resistance gene, sul1 (59/95, 63 %), the trimethoprim resistance gene cassettes dfrA5 (48/95, 50 %) and dfrA1 (25/95, 27 %), the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(A) (51/95, 55 %) and the ampicillin resistance genes blaTEM-1A/B/C (48/95, 52 %) was common. IS26 (77/95, 81 %), an insertion element known to capture and mobilize a wide spectrum of antimicrobial resistance genes, was also frequently identified. These studies provide a baseline snapshot of drug-resistant APEC in Australia and their role in the carriage of ColV-like virulence plasmids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30733779>Influence of cold pretreatment on shoot regeneration from callus in date palm ( L.) cv. 'Barhee'.</a></h1><p>Mass propagation of date palm through indirect somatic embryogenesis or organogenesis has attracted the interest of commercial producers. But, this technique still faces some problems that hindered the production of date palm plantlets . Tissue  is one of the serious problems that reduce callus growth and shoot regeneration. So the objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of cold pretreatment on callus growth, shoot regeneration, and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity during the callus culture. Results showed that a high survival rate of callus cultures (100%) were obtained when cultures were incubated in low temperature (cold treatment) for 45 and 75 days. On the other hand, total amount on phenolic compounds was also reduced to 0.47 and 0.53 mg GAE/g after same period of incubation (45 and 75 days respectively) at low temperature. In additional, our results showed that the highest frequency of shoot formation (66.67 and 73.34, %) and the highest shoot numbers (7.8 and 8.6 shoots/100 mg) were obtained from callus treated with low temperature for 45 and 75 days, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571036>Perioperative outcomes and cost of robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.</a></h1><p>Utilization of robotic-assisted inguinal hernia repair (IHR) has increased in recent years, but randomized or prospective studies comparing outcomes and cost of laparoscopic and Robotic-IHR are still lacking. With conflicting results from only five retrospective series available in the literature comparing the two approaches, the question remains whether current robotic technology provides any added benefits to treat inguinal hernias. We aimed to compare perioperative outcomes and costs of Robotic-IHR versus laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal IHR (Laparoscopic-IHR).Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who underwent Robotic-IHR or Laparoscopic-IHR at a dedicated MIS unit in the USA from February 2015 to June 2017. Demographics, anthropometrics, the proportion of bilateral and recurrent hernias, operative details, cost, length of stay, 30-day readmissions and reoperations, and rates and severity of complications were compared.183 patients had surgery: 45 (24.6%) Robotic-IHR and 138 (75.4%) Laparoscopic-IHR. There were no differences between groups in age, gender, BMI, ASA class, the proportion of bilateral hernias and recurrent hernias, and length of stay. Operative time (Robotic-IHR: 116 ± 36 min, vs. Laparoscopic-IHR: 95±44 min, p < 0.01), reoperations (Robotic-IHR: 6.7%, vs. Laparoscopic-IHR: 0%, p = 0.01), and readmissions rates were greater for Robotic-IHR. While the overall perioperative complication rate was similar in between groups (Robotic-IHR: 28.9% vs. Laparoscopic-IHR: 18.1%, p = 0.14), Robotic-IHR was associated with a significantly greater proportion of grades III and IV complications (Robotic-IHR: 6.7% vs. Laparoscopic-IHR: 0%, p = 0.01). Total hospital cost was significantly higher for the Robotic-IHRs ($9993 vs. $5994, p < 0.01). The added cost associated with the robotic device itself was $3106 per case and the total cost of disposable supplies was comparable between the  groups.In the setting in which it was studied, the outcomes of Laparoscopic-IHR were significantly superior to the Robotic-IHR, at lower hospital costs. Laparoscopic-IHR remains the preferred minimally invasive surgical approach to treat inguinal hernias.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30696272>The effect of high-power ultrasound on the quality of carrot juice.</a></h1><p>The effect of high-power ultrasound treatment on enzymes' activity, physicochemical attributes (total soluble solids, pH, viscosity, turbidity, particle size distribution and colour) and carotenoids' content of carrot juice was investigated. The treatments were carried out at 20 kHz (0.95, .38, 3.80 W/ml power) in an ice bath for , 4, 6, 8, 10 min. The polyphenol oxidase and pectin methylesterase activity were decreased by 43.90 and 37.95% at 3.80 W/ml power and 10 min exposure time, respectively. With the increase of power and time, the effect of high-power ultrasound on the inactivation of enzymes was getting stronger. However, high-power ultrasound had no inactivation effect on peroxidase activity under all treatment conditions. The visual colour differences were not obvious after high-power ultrasound. The pH, total soluble solids and particle size distribution of carrot juice were not significantly affected ( > 0.05) under all treatment conditions, while turbidity was increased and carotenoids' content was decreased. The viscosity of carrot juice was decreased by 1.27% at 0.95 W/ml power and 8 min, while it was increased by .29% at .38 W/ml power and 8 min. The value of viscosity was negatively correlated with the activity of pectin methylesterase (Pearson's r = -0.481,  < 0.05). According to these results, we could conclude that the optimal treatment condition was 3.80 W/ml for 10 min. Overall, high-power ultrasound treatment inhibited , maintained taste and nutritional value and improved stability of carrot juice. Therefore, this technology could well be an option for processing of carrot juice and laid the theoretical foundation for the production of carrot juice and carrot compound beverage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161561>High dose of linagliptin induces thermogenic beige adipocytes in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue in diet-induced obese C57BL/6 mice.</a></h1><p>To verify whether the treatment with linagliptin induces the  of the subcutaneous WAT (sWAT) and thermogenesis in murine diet-induced obesity (DIO) model.Forty animals were randomly assigned to receive a control diet (C, 10% lipids as energy) or a high-fat diet (HF, 50% lipids as energy) for 10 weeks. Each group was re-divided to begin the 5-week treatment, totalizing four experimental groups: C, C-L (C plus linagliptin, 30 mg/kg body mass; BM), HF, and HF-L (HF plus linagliptin, 30 mg/kg BM). The drug was mixed with diet.HF animals showed overweight, glucose intolerance, and a greater cross-sectional area of adipocytes. The treatment with linagliptin was able to normalize the BM, restore the glucose tolerance and the cross-sectional area of adipocytes. These observations comply with the observation of UCP1-positive multilocular adipocytes in the sWAT of treated animals. Both treated groups (C-L and HF-L) showed high expression of thermogenic and type  cytokines genes, which agree with the enhanced body temperature and the lower respiratory exchange ratio, implying enhanced thermogenesis with the use of lipids as fuel.The reduced BM, the enhanced body temperature, and the presence of positive UCP1 beige cells in the sWAT point to the activation of the  cascade on the sWAT of linagliptin-treated mice, and hence, linagliptin could induce the thermogenic pathway as a pleiotropic effect that can have translational potential.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667363>Adipocyte  and resistance to obesity in mice is induced by expression of ATF3.</a></h1><p>Billions of people have obesity-related metabolic syndromes such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Promoting the  of white adipose tissue has been suggested as a potential strategy, but a drug still needs to be identified. Here, genetic deletion of activating transcription factor 3 (  ) in mice under a high-fat diet (HFD) resulted in obesity and insulin resistance, which was abrogated by virus-mediated ATF3 restoration. ST32da, a synthetic ATF3 inducer isolated from , promoted ATF3 expression to downregulate adipokine genes and induce adipocyte  by suppressing the carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 axis. Furthermore, ST32da increased white adipose tissue  and reduced lipogenesis in HFD-induced obese mice. The anti-obesity efficacy of oral ST32da administration was similar to that of the clinical drug orlistat. Our study identified the ATF3 inducer ST32da as a promising therapeutic drug for treating diet-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353553>Postharvest application of antibrowning chemicals modulates oxidative stress and delays pericarp  of controlled atmosphere stored litchi fruit.</a></h1><p>Litchi fruit were treated with methionine [(0.25%) MN] and cysteine [(025%) CN] alone or in combination, and kept under 1% O + 5% CO controlled atmosphere (CA) at 5 ± 1ºC for 28 days. Among different treatments, CN was most effective to inhibit , than MN and CN + MN under CA conditions. Application of 0.25% CN significantly delayed  index, reduced disease incidence, weight loss, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, electrolyte leakage, hydrogen peroxide (H O ), superoxide anion (O  ) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities with higher contents of total anthocyanins under CA-storage. In addition, 0.25% CN treatment showed higher contents of ascorbic acid, total phenolics (TPC), and ,-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl-radical scavenging capacity and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase (CAT) enzymes having maintained quality attributes. Therefore, 0.25% CN pre-treatment could be considered a promising way for managing , and conserving litchi fruit quality under CA-storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Litchi fruit are highly perishable due to rapid pericarp  having limited postharvest market potential. The  takes place due to enzymatic reactions and phenolic oxidation. However, it can be delayed by exogenous antibrowning treatments and suitable storage environment. The delayed incidence of pericarp  may help to maintain its quality with extended storage potential suitable for domestic and international markets. So, the outcomes of the current work may help to maintain overall quality and to extend its storage potential that would be helpful in extending its market life with maintained visual quality at domestic and international destinations.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705393>Even a low dose of tamoxifen profoundly induces adipose tissue  in female mice.</a></h1><p>Tamoxifen-inducible Cre/lox site-specific recombination technology has been widely used to generate conditional transgenic mice. As an estrogen receptor ligand, tamoxifen itself potentially affects energy metabolism, which may confound interpretation of data especially in metabolic studies. Considering sexual dimorphism, in this study, the effects of low-dose tamoxifen administration on energy metabolism, and  of adipose tissues in female and male mice were investigated.Female and male C57/BL6 mice were injected with tamoxifen oil solution (i.p.) and then housed at both room temperature (23 ±  °C) and cold environment (6 ± 1 °C). Serum, brown and white adipose tissues were obtained, and the effects of tamoxifen administration on energy metabolism and the  of adipose tissues were evaluated.At 25 mg/kg body weight (BDW), tamoxifen administration for 3 alternative days decreased the percentage of inguinal and gonadal white adipose tissue weights in female mice accompanied by the up-regulation of thermogenesis in adipose tissues. In contrast, this dosage of tamoxifen did not induce noticeable changes in the energy metabolism and thermogenesis of adipose tissue in male mice under room temperature. Consistently, under cold stimulus, substantial  of adipose tissues was observed in female mice injected with tamoxifen (50 mg/kg BDW, single injection) but not in male mice. Two-way ANOVA tests also demonstrated significant interactions between tamoxifen treatment and gender on the expression of thermogenic markers in adipose tissues.Tamoxifen, even at a low dose, remarkably increases thermogenesis in adipose tissues of female mice; meanwhile, such a low dose could be used in male mice for inducing gene recombination without confounding the interpretation of data related to metabolism and thermogenesis of adipose tissues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31397707>Closing the Gap Between Preclinical and Clinical Training: Impact of a Transition-to-Clerkship Course on Medical Students' Clerkship Performance.</a></h1><p>Medical students typically perform worse on clinical clerkships that take place early in their training compared to those that occur later. Some institutions have developed transition-to-clerkship courses (TTCCs) to improve students' preparedness for the clinical phase of the curriculum. Yet, the impact of TTCCs on students' performance has not been evaluated.The authors developed and implemented a TTCC at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine and measured its impact on students' clerkship performance. During the 2014-2015 academic year, they introduced a -week intersession TTCC. The goal was to improve students' readiness for clerkships by fostering the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required to care for patients throughout a hospitalization. The TTCC included panel discussions, skills development sessions, case-based workshops, and a 4-station standardized patient simulation. The authors assessed the feasibility of designing and implementing the TTCC and students' reactions and clerkship performance.The total direct costs were $3,500. Students reacted favorably and reported improved comfort on entering clerkships. Summative performance evaluations across clerkships were higher for those students who received the TTCC with simulation compared to those students who received the standard clerkship orientation (P < .001 - .04, Cohen's d range = 0.23 - 0.62). This finding was particularly apparent in those clerkships that occurred earlier in the academic year.Future plans include evaluating the impact of the TTCC on student well-being and incorporating elements of the TTCC into the preclinical curriculum.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496871>Effects of caloric restriction on the expression of lipocalin- and its receptor in the brown adipose tissue of high-fat diet-fed mice.</a></h1><p>Obesity causes inflammation and impairs thermogenic functions in brown adipose tissue (BAT). The adipokine lipocalin  (LCN2) has been implicated in inflammation and obesity. Herein, we investigated the protective effects of caloric restriction (CR) on LCN2-mediated inflammation and oxidative stress in the BAT of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Mice were fed a HFD for 20 weeks and then either continued on the HFD or subjected to CR for the next 12 weeks. CR led to the  of the white fat-like phenotype in HFD-fed mice. Increased expressions of LCN2 and its receptor in the BAT of HFD-fed mice were significantly attenuated by CR. Additionally, HFD+CR-fed mice had fewer neutrophils and macrophages expressing LCN2 and iron-positive cells than HFD-fed mice. Further, oxidative stress and mitochondrial fission induced by a HFD were also significantly attenuated by CR. Our findings indicate that the protective effects of CR on inflammation and oxidative stress in the BAT of obese mice may be associated with regulation of LCN2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480632>Pulsed Light treatment below a Critical Fluence (3.82 J/cm) minimizes photo-degradation and  of a model Phenolic (Gallic Acid) Solution.</a></h1><p>Pulsed light (PL) is one of the most promising non-thermal technologies used in food preservation and processing. Its application results in reduction of microbial load as well as influences the quality of food. The data about the impact of PL on bioactive compounds is ambiguous, therefore the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of PL treatment of a gallic acid aqueous solution-as a model system of phenolic abundant liquid food matrices. The effect of PL treatment was evaluated based on colour, phenolic content concentration and antioxidant activity measured by DPPH assay using a design of experiments approach. The PL fluence (which is the cumulative energy input) was varied by varying the pulse frequency and time. Using Response Surface Methodology, prediction models were developed for the effect of fluence on gallic acid properties. It was demonstrated that PL can modify the optical properties of gallic acid and cause reactions and degradation of gallic acid. However, application of PL did not significantly alter the overall quality of the model gallic acid solution at low fluence levels. Cluster analysis revealed that below 3.82 J/cm, changes in gallic acid were minimal, and this fluence level could be used as the critical level for food process design aiming to minimize nutrient loss.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31085768>On the role of macrophages in the control of adipocyte energy metabolism.</a></h1><p>The crosstalk between macrophages (MΦ) and adipocytes within white adipose tissue (WAT) impacts obesity-associated insulin resistance and other associated metabolic disorders, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and type  diabetes. MΦ infiltration is increased in WAT during obesity, which is linked to decreased mitochondrial content and activity. The mechanistic interplay between MΦ and mitochondrial function of adipocytes is under intense investigation, as MΦ and inflammatory pathways exhibit a pivotal role in the reprogramming of WAT metabolism in physiological responses during cold, fasting and exercise. Thus, the underlying immunometabolic pathways may offer therapeutic targets to correct obesity and metabolic disease. Here, I review the current knowledge on the quantity and the quality of human adipose tissue macrophages (ATMΦ) and their impact on the bioenergetics of human adipocytes. The effects of ATMΦ and their secreted factors on mitochondrial function of white adipocytes are discussed, including recent research on MΦ as part of an immune signaling cascade involved in the '' of WAT, which is defined as the conversion from white, energy-storing adipocytes into brown, energy-dissipating adipocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365355>Masking Release for Speech-in-Speech Recognition Due to a Target/Masker Sex Mismatch in Children With Hearing Loss.</a></h1><p>The goal of the present study was to compare the extent to which children with hearing loss and children with normal hearing benefit from mismatches in target/masker sex in the context of speech-in-speech recognition. It was hypothesized that children with hearing loss experience a smaller target/masker sex mismatch benefit relative to children with normal hearing due to impairments in peripheral encoding, variable access to high-quality auditory input, or both.Eighteen school-age children with sensorineural hearing loss (7 to 15 years) and 18 age-matched children with normal hearing participated in this study. Children with hearing loss were bilateral hearing aid users. Severity of hearing loss ranged from mild to severe across participants, but most had mild to moderate hearing loss. Speech recognition thresholds for disyllabic words presented in a two-talker speech masker were estimated in the sound field using an adaptive, forced-choice procedure with a picture-pointing response. Participants were tested in each of four conditions: (1) male target speech/two-male-talker masker; () male target speech/two-female-talker masker; (3) female target speech/two-female-talker masker; and (4) female target speech/two-male-talker masker. Children with hearing loss were tested wearing their personal hearing aids at user settings.Both groups of children showed a sex-mismatch benefit, requiring a more advantageous signal to noise ratio when the target and masker were matched in sex than when they were mismatched. However, the magnitude of sex-mismatch benefit was significantly reduced for children with hearing loss relative to age-matched children with normal hearing. There was no effect of child age on the magnitude of sex-mismatch benefit. The sex-mismatch benefit was larger for male target speech than for female target speech. For children with hearing loss, the magnitude of sex-mismatch benefit was not associated with degree of hearing loss or aided audibility.The findings from the present study indicate that children with sensorineural hearing loss are able to capitalize on acoustic differences between speech produced by male and female talkers when asked to recognize target words in a competing speech masker. However, children with hearing loss experienced a smaller benefit relative to their peers with normal hearing. No association between the sex-mismatch benefit and measures of unaided thresholds or aided audibility were observed for children with hearing loss, suggesting that reduced peripheral encoding is not the only factor responsible for the smaller sex-mismatch benefit relative to children with normal hearing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480627>Lyophilized Maqui () Berry Induces  in the Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue and Ameliorates the Insulin Resistance in High Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h1><p>Maqui () berry features a unique profile of anthocyanidins that includes high amounts of delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside-5-O-glucoside and delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside and has shown positive effects on fasting glucose and insulin levels in humans and murine models of type  diabetes and obesity. The molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of maqui on the onset and development of the obese phenotype and insulin resistance was investigated in high fat diet-induced obese mice supplemented with a lyophilized maqui berry. Maqui-dietary supplemented animals showed better insulin response and decreased weight gain but also a differential expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, multilocular lipid droplet formation and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). These changes correlated with an increased expression of the carbohydrate response element binding protein b (), the sterol regulatory binding protein 1c () and Cellular repressor of adenovirus early region 1A-stimulated genes 1 () and an improvement in the fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) signaling. Our evidence suggests that maqui dietary supplementation activates the induction of fuel storage and thermogenesis characteristic of a brown-like phenotype in scWAT and counteracts the unhealthy metabolic impact of an HFD. This induction constitutes a putative strategy to prevent/treat diet-induced obesity and its associated comorbidities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797155>Effect of resveratrol on expression of genes involved thermogenesis in mice and humans.</a></h1><p>The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of resveratrol on FNDC5 and thermogenesis markers expression in the adipose tissue of mice and humans. Thirty-two male mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 8) and fed with: Standard Diet; Standard Diet + Resveratrol (400 mg/kg); High-fat Diet; High-fat Diet + Resveratrol for eight weeks. Twenty male and female volunteers, aged 30-55 years, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² were divided into two groups and treated for four weeks with 500 mg trans-resveratrol or placebo, adipose tissue biopsies were taken. Analysis of body weight, food intake, glycemic and lipid profiles, mRNA expression from tissues and primary culture of adipocytes were performed. The main results show that resveratrol improves the glycaemic and lipid profiles along with an increase in the levels of UCP1, PRDM16, PGC1α, and SIRT1. The increase in FNDC5 expression was observed in the mouse and human subcutaneous adipose tissue. The SIRT1 antagonist in adipocyte primary culture resulted in decreased FNDC5 expression. Our data suggest that improved metabolism produced by oral administration of resveratrol is, at least in part, associated with increased thermogenesis followed by high expression of UCP1, PRDM16, PGC1α and that increased FNDC5 expression in the subcutaneous adipose tissue from mice and human might be modulated by SIRT1.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In vitro, the differentiation of 3 T3-L1 cells was used to elicit thermogenesis in the presence of PFE. PFE obviously reduced body weight and fat mass in a dose-dependent manner, increased energy expenditure, improved insulin sensitivity, and prevented hepatic steatosis by increasing lipid oxidation and secretion in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, PFE induced clear  in sWAT, significantly increased phosphorylation of AMPKα1/ and p38, increased BAT activity and the differentiation of 3 T3-L1 by increasing the expression of uncoupling protein 1 and other thermogenic genes.

There are different types of body fats such as white adipose tissue (WAT), which stores surplus energy in the body, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) which utilize energy to produce heat during metabolism. BAT acts many beneficial functions in metabolic disorders including type  diabetes and obesity. Recent studies have investigated methods for promoting the fat  process of WAT in obesity because of various reasons such as the improvement of insulin resistance, and weight loss. Among natural polyphenolic compounds, resveratrol has been highlighted due to its anti-oxidant and anti-obesity as well as anti-inflammation and anti-cancer properties. Recent studies have paid a lot of attention to that resveratrol may act as a fat  activator, involved in the secretion of many myokines and adipokines. Here, we reviewed the role of resveratrol in fat  and also the association between resveratrol and adipokines/myokines in the fat  process. Our review may provide novel insight into the role of resveratrol in fat , leading to the maintenance of a healthy weight against obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Recently, we and others found that  of white adipose tissue (WAT) is a critical component of this complex detrimental response. Although  and inflammation have been independently delineated to occur after injury, their interaction is currently not well defined. One of the master regulators of inflammation and adipose tissue remodeling after burns is nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The aim of this this study was to determine whether NLRP3 modulates and activates WAT  after burn. To obtain molecular and mechanistic insights, we used an NLRP3 knockout (NLRP3) murine burn model. We demonstrated that genetic deletion of NLRP3 promoted persistent and augmented  in adipocytes, evidenced by increased gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and  at 3 days (5.74 vs. 0.29,  < 0.05; 26.0 vs. 0.71,  < 0.05) and uncoupling protein 1 () and  at 7 days (7,406 vs. 3,894,  < 0.05; 20.6 vs. .52,  < 0.01) and enhanced UCP1 staining and multilocularity. Additionally, the main regulator of postburn WAT , IL-6, was elevated in the plasma acutely after burn in NLRP3 compared with wild-type counterparts (478.9 vs. 67.1 pg/mL,  < 0.05 at 3 days). These results suggest that NLRP3 has antibrowning effects and that blocking NLRP3 increases thermogenesis and augments  via increased levels of IL-6.

In order to better exert the effect of heat production, and protect the vital organs of the body to avoid damage to the cold environment, Jiang Gui Fang (JG) was obtained from clinical utilization in the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine at General Hospital of Northern Theater Command for many years and has exhibited favorable efficacy. This formula was an empirical formula that was developed based on the research of Gui Zhi Tang, the principles of traditional Chinese medicine and survey a large number of literature. The basis for compatibility of JG was that we selected dried ginger, cassia twig, and licorice in Gui Zhi Tang, which play a major role in the treatment of exogenous cold, and combined with other Chinese medicines, such as pueraria, spatholobus, acanthopanacis cortex, euodiae fructus, codonopsis pilosula.To promote the increase of core temperature of the body and prevent invasion of the major organs from cold environment. We studied the effect of JG on the core body temperature of mice, then explored its regulation of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and the possible mechanism. Finally, we determine phytochemical compositions of JG that play a role in heat production.For in vivo studies, we performed a 4-week treatment of JG in acute cold environment at -20 °C and chronic cold exposure at 4 °C. The core temperature, adipose tissue weight, serum parameters, and morphological observation of adipocytes, liver and kidney were measured. Then we investigated the expression levels of adipogenic factors, thermogenic factors and lipoprotein. In vitro, we determined the lipid droplet content, ATP content, and the maximum oxygen consumption of mitochondria.JG treatment promoted core temperature, inhibited eWAT weight, protected kidney, consumed glucose and lipids in Kunming (KM) mice. It also enhanced BAT-associated thermogenic factor uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and peroxisome proliferator-actived receptorγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α). The expressions of the lipogenic factor peroxisome proliferate-activator receptor gamma (PPARγ) and lipolytic protein hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase (HSL) in eWAT were elevated. H&E and immunohistochemistry showed that JG significantly reduced the size of iBAT and eWAT, elevated UCP1 expression levels. In vitro, JG lowered the content of lipid droplets and ATP in brown fat cells. Maximum oxygen consumption capacity of mitochondria and the expression levels of UCP1, PGC1α and silent mating type information regulation  homolog 1 (SIRT1) were enhanced after JG treatment.In vivo and in vitro studies showed that JG obviously increased the core temperature of mice by activating iBAT and inducing eWAT . The mechanism depended on the PPARγ/SIRT1-PGC1α pathway. Our results will provide a reference for further study of iBAT activation and eWAT  to heat production.Copyright © 2019.

Irisin has been shown to increase  of adipose tissue, thermogenesis, energy expenditure, and insulin sensitivity, yet its association with inflammatory markers is still limited. Circulating irisin has been found to be increased in obesity, while in adult subjects with T2DM decreased levels have been found. However, data establishing the association of circulating irisin in children and adolescents with T2DM has not been described in the literature. The objective of this study was to determine irisin plasma concentration and its association with metabolic and adiposity markers and with hs-CRP, a surrogate marker of inflammation used in clinical practice, in a pediatric population with T2DM. A cross-sample of 40 Mexican children and adolescents aged 7-17 were recruited, 20 diagnosed with T2DM and 20 healthy controls. Plasma irisin levels were found to be lower in the T2DM group compared with controls, which could be attributed to a reduced PGC-1 activity in muscle tissue with a consequent decrease in FNDC5 and irisin expression. Irisin concentration was found to be positively correlated with HDL-c, LDL-c, and total cholesterol, while negatively correlated with BMI, waist circumference, and triglycerides. However, after multiple regression analysis, only HDL-c correlation remained significant. hs-CRP was higher in the T2DM group and positively associated with adiposity markers, unfavorable lipid profile, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR, but no association with irisin was found. Given the favorable metabolic effects attributed to irisin, the low plasma levels found in children and adolescents with T2DM could exacerbate the inflammatory and metabolic imbalances and the intrinsic cardiovascular risk of this disease. We propose an "irisin-proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory axis" to explain the role of irisin as a metabolic regulator in obesity and T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419548>Leptin deficiency reverses high metabolic state and weight loss without affecting central pathology in the R6/ mouse model of Huntington's disease.</a></h1><p>Body weight has been shown to be a predictor of clinical progression in Huntington's disease (HD). Alongside widespread neuronal pathology, both HD patients and the R6/ mouse model of HD exhibit weight loss and increased energy expenditure, providing a rationale for targeting whole-body energy metabolism in HD. Leptin-deficient mice display low energy expenditure and increased body weight. We therefore hypothesized that normalizing energy metabolism in R6/ mice, utilizing leptin- deficiency, would lead to a slower disease progression in the R6/ mouse. In this study, we show that R6/ mice on a leptin-deficient genetic background display increased body weight and increased fat mass compared to R6/ mice, as well as wild type littermates. The increased body weight was accompanied by low energy expenditure, illustrated by a reduction in respiratory exchange rate. Leptin-deficient R6/ mice had large white adipocytes with white adipocyte gene expression characteristics, in contrast to white adipose tissue in R6/ mice, where white adipose tissue showed signs of . Leptin-deficient R6/ mice did not exhibit improved neuropathological measures. Our results indicate that lowering energy metabolism in HD, by increasing fat mass and reducing respiratory exchange rate, is not sufficient to affect neuropathology. Further studies targeting energy metabolism in HD are warranted.Copyright © 2019.

Both the steady-state and the transient response are experimentally characterized, and compact models for the PC current are developed. Utilizing the PC effect, a topology-agnostic algorithm is then outlined. The calibration procedure is experimentally verified against calibration with external photo-detectors using a non-blocking 4×4 Benes switch consisting of six × MZIs. It is shown that our PC-based approach agrees with the PD-based procedure within less than .5% of difference between the obtained calibrated values. Based on the calibrated PC values, all possible routing configurations are measured for extinction ratio (9.92-21.51dB), insertion loss (0.88-4.59dB), and exhibiting performances far below the 7% FEC limit (bit error rate of 3.8 × 10 ) using 25 Gbps 4-level pulse-amplitude-modulation signals (PAM4).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511465>Influence of Protein Hydrolysis on the Freeze-thaw Stability of Emulsions Prepared with Soy Protein - Dextran Conjugates.</a></h1><p>Protein hydrolysis on the freeze-thaw stability of emulsions prepared with soy protein - dextran conjugates were investigated. Soy protein isolate-dextran (SPI-D) and soy protein hydrolysates-dextran (SPH-D) conjugates with different degree of hydrolysis (DH) were formed by Maillard reaction. The formation of protein-polysaccharide conjugates between SPI/SPH and dextran molecules was confirmed by SDS-PAGE; this finding was consistent with the degree of glycation and the  index. The freeze-thaw emulsion stability was investigated. The results confirmed that the SPH3-D (DH at 3%) emulsion with 3% DH of SPI exhibited the lowest creaming index after experiencing 1, , and 3 freeze-thaw cycles , with results of 7.69%, 20.74% and 31.30%, respectively. The SPH3-D emulsion had a significantly lower average particle size, which was reduced by 48.28% compared to the SPI-D emulsion. Meanwhile, the SPH3-D solution had low interfacial tension. The confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis indicated that the SPH3-D emulsions were strongly stable against the freeze-thaw treatment and could be used as effective emulsifiers in frozen foods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400965>The 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology Hydroxychloroquine Dosing Guidelines For Short, Obese Patients.</a></h1><p>The increasing prevalence of obesity over the past 60 years implies the need to reassess the risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (HR) in obese women using the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2016 guidelines.Cross-sectional study.Medical records of 64 patients with HR from the practices of  ophthalmologists, 11 of whom were women with body mass index of 30 kg/m or more, were reviewed.Daily dosing based on real and ideal weight was calculated.Determine the number (and percentage) of patients given daily dosing according to real-weight and ideal-weight guidelines.In 4 patients (36%), daily dosing was more than 5 mg/kg based on real weight and more than 6.5 mg/kg based on ideal weight. In 4 patients (36%), daily dosing was 5 mg/kg or less based on real weight and 6.5 mg/kg or less based on ideal weight. In 3 patients (27%), daily dosing was 5 mg/kg or less based on real weight and more than 6.5 mg/kg based on ideal weight. No patient had daily dosing of more than 5 mg/kg based on real weight and 6.5 mg/kg or less based on ideal weight.Twenty-seven percent of cases of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in obese women had ostensibly safe dosing based on 2016 AAO guidelines. Overdosing of obese women by 2016 AAO guidelines is not rare. Daily dosing based on the older 6.5-mg/kg ideal weight threshold is safer in women with a body mass index of 30 kg/m or more.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Hurricane waves can cause physical damage to coastal ecosystems, re-suspend and transport antecedent seafloor sediment, while the associated intense rainfall can yield large influxes of land-derived sediment to the coast (e.g. burial of ecosystems). To understand sedimentation provenance (terrestrial or marine) and changes induced by the hurricanes, we collected bathymetry surveys and sediment samples of Coral Bay, St. John, US Virgin Islands in August 2017, (pre-storms) and repeated it in November 2017 (post-storms). Comparison reveals morphologic seafloor changes and widespread aggradation with an average of ~25 cm of sediment deposited over a 1.28 km benthic zone. Despite an annual amount of precipitation between surveys, sediment yield modeling suggests watersheds contributed <0.% of the total depositional volume. Considering locally established accumulation rates, this multi-hurricane event equates to ~1-3 centuries of deposition. Critical benthic communities (corals, seagrasses) can be partially or fully buried by deposits of this thickness and previous studies demonstrate that prolonged burial of similar organisms often leads to mortality. This study illuminates how storm events can result in major sediment deposition, which can significantly impact seafloor morphology and composition and benthic ecosystems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31235818>RepSox, a small molecule inhibitor of the TGFβ receptor, induces brown adipogenesis and  of white adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Unlike white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) is mainly responsible for energy expenditure via thermogenesis by uncoupling the respiratory chain. Promoting the differentiation of brown fat precursor cells and the  of white fat have become a research hotspot for the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic diseases. Several secreted factors and a number of small molecules have been found to promote brown adipogenesis. Here we report that a single small-molecule compound, RepSox, is sufficient to induce adipogenesis from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in fibroblast culture medium. RepSox is an inhibitor of the transforming growth factor-beta receptor I (TGF-β-RI), other inhibitors of TGF-β pathway such as SB431542, LY2157299, A83-01, and Tranilast are also effective in inducing adipogenesis from MEFs. These adipocytes express brown adipocyte-specific transcription factors and thermogenesis genes, and contain a large number of mitochondria and have a high level of mitochondrial respiratory activity. More interestingly, RepSox has also been found to promote the differentiation of the brown fat precursor cells and induce  of the white fat precursor cells. These findings suggest that inhibitors of TGF-β signaling pathway might be developed as new therapeutics for obesity and type  diabetes.</p></html>
