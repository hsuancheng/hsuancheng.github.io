We demonstrate that the BTNL3 IgV domain binds directly and specifically to a human Vγ4 TCR, "LES" with an affinity (∼15-25 μM) comparable to many αβ TCR-peptide major histocompatibility complex interactions. Mutations in germline-encoded Vγ4 CDR2 and HV4 loops, but not in somatically recombined CDR3 loops, drastically diminished binding and T cell responsiveness to BTNL3-BTNL8-expressing cells. Conversely, CDR3γ and CDR3δ loops mediated LES TCR binding to endothelial protein C receptor, a clonally restricted autoantigen, with minimal CDR1, CDR2, or HV4 contributions. Thus, the γδ TCR can employ two discrete binding modalities: a non-clonotypic, superantigen-like interaction mediating subset-specific regulation by BTNL/BTN molecules and CDR3-dependent, antibody-like interactions mediating adaptive γδ T cell biology. How these findings might broadly apply to γδ T cell regulation is also examined.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Many areas of the world present both, vector fauna and geographical conditions compatible with co-circulation, importing, emergence, and epidemics of flaviviruses of different serocomplexes. In this study, we aimed to identify both, immunological determinants and patterns of immune response possibly involved in flavivirus serocomplex cross-protection. We searched  and T cells epitopes which were thoroughly shown to be involved in flavivirus immunological control. Such epitopes were analyzed regarding their conservation, population coverage, and location along flavivirus polyprotein. We found that epitopes capable of eliciting flavivirus cross-protective  to a wide range of human populations are concentrated in proteins E, NS3, and NS5. Such identification of both, immunological determinants and patterns of immune response involved in flavivirus cross-protective  should be considered in future vaccine development.

Besides antigen presentation and antibody production,  cells also play a role in immune regulation and induction of tolerance through several mechanisms. Our understanding of -lineage cells with regulatory ability has been revolutionized by the delineation of heterogeneous subsets of these cells. Specific environmental signals may further determine the polarization and function of -lineage regulatory cells. With the availability of new genetic, molecular and pharmacological tools, considerable advances have been made towards our understanding of the surface phenotype, developmental processes and functions of these cells. These exciting discoveries, some of which are still controversial, also raise many new questions, which makes the inhibitory function of  cells a rapidly growing field in immunopathology. Here we review highlights of the regulatory activity of  cells and the recent advances in the function and phenotype of these -cell subsets in healthy and diseased states.© The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2019.

According to various estimates, 10-20% of all human cancers are caused by viruses. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis  and C viruses, human papillomavirus (HPV), human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8), and Merkel cell polyomavirus were implicated in initiating tumors. At the same time, the long period between viral infection and the manifestation of cancer significantly complicates the search for a causal relationship between the presence of a virus in the human organism and the malignant transformation. For this reason, the role of certain viruses in the initiation of neoplastic processes in humans remains an unresolved issue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602863>[Traditional Chinese medicine (tumor) prevention and evaluation model based on ultra-early immune response information amplification index naCTL and multidimensional immunoinformatic index TCR/BCR/HLA effective diversity].</a></h2><p>The best time of tumor intervention is before the formation of tumor.

Annual influenza vaccination is strongly recommended but few clinical studies have assessed its immunogenicity in individuals with SCD. The aim of this study was to explore the biological efficacy of annual influenza vaccination in SCD patients by characterizing both their humoral and cell-mediated  against influenza antigen. We also aimed to investigate these immunological responses among SCD individuals according to their treatment (hydroxyurea (HU), chronic blood transfusions (CT), both HU and CT or none of them).Seventy-two SCD patients (49 receiving HU, 9 on CT, 7 with both and 7 without treatment) and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. All subjects received the tetravalent influenza α-RIX-Tetra® vaccine from the 2016-2017 or 2017-2018 season.Protective anti-influenza HAI titers were obtained for the majority of SCD patients one month after vaccination but seroconversion rates in patient groups were strongly decreased compared to controls. Immune cell counts, particularly cellular memory including memory T and memory  cells, were greatly reduced in SCD individuals. Functional activation assays confirmed a poorer CD8+ T cell memory. We also document an imbalance of cytokines after influenza vaccination in SCD individuals with an INFγ/IL-10 ratio (Th1-type/Treg-type response) significantly lower in the SCD cohort.SCD patients undergoing CT showed altered immune regulation as compared to other treatment subgroups. Altogether, the cytokine imbalance, the high regulatory T cell levels and the low memory lymphocyte subset levels observed in the SCD cohort, namely for those on CT, suggest a poor ability of SCD patients to fight against influenza infection. Nevertheless, our serological data support current clinical practice for annual influenza vaccination, though immunogenicity to other vaccines involving immunological memory might be hampered in SCD patients and should be further investigated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581654>Has The Time Arrived to Refine The Indications of Immunosuppressive Therapy and Prognosis in IgA Nephropathy?</a></h2><p> Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most frequent glomerular disease worldwide and a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Particularly challenging to the clinician is the early identification of patients at high risk of progression, an estimation of the decline in renal function, and the selection of only those that would benefit from additional immunosuppressive therapies. Nevertheless, the pathway to a better prognostication and to the development of targeted therapies in IgAN has been paved by recent understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of this disease. Merging the data from the Oxford Classification validation studies and prospective treatment studies has suggested that a disease-stratifying algorithm would be appropriate for disease management, although it awaits validation in a prospective setting. The emergence of potential noninvasive biomarkers may assist traditional markers (proteinuria, hematuria) in monitoring disease activity and treatment response. The recent landmark trials of IgAN treatment (STOP-IgAN and TESTING trials) have suggested that the risks associated with immunosuppressive therapy outweigh the benefits, which may shift the treatment paradigm of this disease. While awaiting the approval of the first therapies for IgAN, more targeted and less toxic immunotherapies are warranted. Accordingly, the targeting of complement activation, the modulation of mucosal , the antagonism of -cell activating factors, and proteasomal inhibition are currently being evaluated in pilot studies for IgAN treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582377>Synovial tissue signatures enhance clinical classification and prognostic/treatment response algorithms in early inflammatory arthritis and predict requirement for subsequent biological therapy: results from the pathobiology of early arthritis cohort (PEAC).</a></h2><p>To establish whether synovial pathobiology improves current clinical classification and prognostic algorithms in early inflammatory arthritis and identify predictors of subsequent biological therapy requirement.200 treatment-naïve patients with early arthritis were classified as fulfilling RA1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (RA1987) or as undifferentiated arthritis (UA) and patients with UA further classified into those fulfilling RA2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria. Treatment requirements at 12 months (Conventional Synthetic Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) vs biologics vs no-csDMARDs treatment) were determined. Synovial tissue was retrieved by minimally invasive, ultrasound-guided biopsy and underwent processing for immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular characterisation. Samples were analysed for macrophage, plasma-cell and -cells and T-cells markers, pathotype classification (lympho-myeloid, diffuse-myeloid or pauci-immune) by IHC and gene expression profiling by Nanostring.128/200 patients were classified as RA1987, 25 as RA2010 and 47 as UA. Patients classified as RA1987 criteria had significantly higher levels of disease activity, histological synovitis, degree of immune cell infiltration and differential upregulation of genes involved in  and T cell activation/function compared with RA2010 or UA, which shared similar clinical and pathobiological features. At 12-month follow-up, a significantly higher proportion of patients classified as lympho-myeloid pathotype required biological therapy. Performance of a clinical prediction model for biological therapy requirement was improved by the integration of synovial pathobiological markers from 78.8% to 89%-90%.The capacity to refine early clinical classification criteria through synovial pathobiological markers offers the potential to predict disease outcome and stratify therapeutic intervention to patients most in need.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, few studies have focused on the antitumor effects of CD8+ T cell-mediated humoral  or on interactions between CD8+ T cells and  cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that the frequency of IL-21-producing CD8+CXCR5+ T cells was higher in HCC tumor tissue than in peritumoral tissue or peripheral blood from the same patients or in blood from healthy donors. Moreover, CD8+CXCR5+ T cells migrated in response to supernatants from primary HCC (HCC-SN) cells, and HCC-SN cells also powerfully induced CXCR5 expression in CD8+ T cells and IL-21 expression in CD8+CXCR5+ T cells. CD8+CXCR5+ T cells from HCC patients, but not those from healthy individuals, stimulated CD19+  cells to differentiate into IgG-producing plasmablasts. These findings reveal that CD8+CXCR5+ T cells strongly infiltrate HCC tumors, and their infiltration is predictive of a better prognosis. Surprisingly, moreover, CD8+CXCR5+ T cells produced IL-21, which induced  cells to differentiate into IgG-producing plasmablasts and to play a key role in humoral  in HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623059>Identification of an Interferon-Stimulated Long Noncoding RNA (LncRNA ISR) Involved in Regulation of Influenza A Virus Replication.</a></h2><p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in a diversity of biological processes. It is known that differential expression of thousands of lncRNAs occurs in host during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. However, only few of them have been well characterized. Here, we identified a lncRNA, named as interferon (IFN)-stimulated lncRNA (ISR), which can be significantly upregulated in response to IAV infection in a mouse model. A sequence alignment revealed that lncRNA ISR is present in mice and human beings, and indeed, we found that it was expressed in several human and mouse cell lines and tissues. Silencing lncRNA ISR in A549 cells resulted in a significant increase in IAV replication, whereas ectopic expression of lncRNA ISR reduced the viral replication. Interestingly, interferon-β (IFN-β) treatment was able to induce lncRNA ISR expression, and induction of lncRNA ISR by viral infection was nearly abolished in host deficient of IFNAR1, a type I IFN receptor. Furthermore, the level of IAV-induced lncRNA ISR expression was decreased either in retinoic acid-inducible gene I () knockout A549 cells and mice or by nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ) inhibitor treatment. Together, these data elucidate that lncRNA ISR is regulated by -dependent signaling that governs IFN-β production during IAV infection, and has an inhibitory capacity in viral replication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641151>LTA1 is a safe, intranasal enterotoxin-based adjuvant that improves vaccine protection against influenza in young, old and -cell-depleted (μMT) mice.</a></h2><p>Enterotoxin-based adjuvants including cholera toxin and heat-labile toxin (LT) are powerful manipulators of mucosal ; however, past clinical trials identified unacceptable neurological toxicity when LT or mutant AB adjuvant proteins were added to intranasal vaccines. Here, we examined the isolated enzymatic A1 domain of LT (LTA1) for intranasal safety and efficacy in combination with influenza (flu) vaccination. LTA1-treated mice exhibited no neurotoxicity, as measured by olfactory system testing and H&E staining of nasal tissue in contrast with cholera toxin. In vaccination studies, intranasal LTA1 enhanced immune responses to inactivated virus antigen and subsequent protection against H1N1 flu challenge in mice (8-week or 24-months). In addition, lung H1N1 viral titers post-challenge correlated to serum antibody responses; however, enhanced protection was also observed in μMT mice lacking -cells while activation and recruitment of CD4 T-cells into the lung was apparent. Thus, we report that LTA1 protein is a novel, safe and effective enterotoxin adjuvant that improves protection of an intranasal flu vaccination by a mechanism that does not appear to require -cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644820>Improving the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a whole-killed malaria blood-stage vaccine by chloroquine.</a></h2><p>A whole-killed malaria blood-stage vaccine (WKV) is promising in reducing the morbidity and mortality of malaria patients, but its efficacy needs to be improved. We found that the antimalarial drug chloroquine could augment the protective efficacy of the WKV of Plasmodium yoelii. The direct antimalarial effect of chloroquine on parasites during immunization could be excluded, as the administration of chloroquine or chloroquine plus alum every two weeks had a slight effect on parasitemia, and an immunization with NP-KLH (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin) plus chloroquine could significantly promote the generation of NP-specific antibodies. Additionally, alum was required for chloroquine to augment the immunogenicity of the pRBC lysate. Chloroquine did not promote the parasite-specific CD4 T cell responses, but significantly enhanced the WKV-induced germinal-center  cell reactions, class-switch recombination and secretion of functionally protective antibodies to plasmodium. The elevated parasite-specific antibodies were demonstrated to largely contribute to the chloroquine-enhanced protective . Thus, we report that chloroquine could be used as an adjuvant to enhance the protective  of WKVs through promoting humoral responses.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649684>Functional Change of Effector Tumor-Infiltrating CCR5CD38HLA-DRCD8 T Cells in Glioma Microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Human glioma facilitates an impaired anti-tumor  response, including defects in circulation of T lymphocytes. The level of CD8 T-cell activation acts as an immune regulator associated with disease progression. However, little is known about the characteristics of peripheral and tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells in patients with glioma. In this study, we examined the level of CD8 T-cell activation in a group of 143 patients with glioma and determined that peripheral CD3 T cells decreased in accordance with disease severity. The patients' peripheral CD8 T-cell populations were similar to that of healthy donors, and a small amount of CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was identified in glioma tissues. An increase in activated CD8 T cells, characterized as CD38HLA-DR, and their association with disease progression were identified in the patients' peripheral blood and glioma, and shown to display enriched CCR5 and TNFR2 expression levels.  examination of CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cells indicated that this subset of cells displayed stronger secretion of IFN-γ and IL-2 before and after a 6-h stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (ION) relative to healthy CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cells, indicating the functional feasibility of CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cells. Higher CCL5 protein and mRNA levels were identified in glioma tissues, which was consistent with the immunohistochemistry results revealing both CCL5 and CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cell expression. Patients' CCR5CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cells were further validated and shown to display increases in CD45RACCR7 and T-bet accompanied by substantial CD107-a, IFN-γ, and Granzyme  levels in response to glioma cells.Copyright © 2019 Chen, Wu, Fang, Chen, Feng, Huang, Wei, Fang and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558731>Prevalence of Hepatitis  Virus Infection in Shenzhen, China, 2015-2018.</a></h2><p>China has nearly 10% of the general HBV carrier population in the world; this infection is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. Understanding HBV epidemiology is essential for future infection control, evaluation, and treatment. This study determined the prevalence of HBV infection in Shenzhen by serological testing and analysis in 282,166 HBV screening cases for the following: HBcAb, indicative of previous HBV infection; HBsAg, indicative of chronic (current) infection; HBsAb, indicative of  from vaccination; and 34,368 HBV etiological screening cases for HBV-DNA, indicative of virus carriage, in which 1,204 cases were genotyped and mutation analyzed for drug-resistance evaluation. Shenzhen was a highly endemic area of HBV throughout the study period (prevalence 9.69%). HBV infections were almost entirely in the 20 and older age groups with a male-to-female ratio of 1.16:1 which is approximately the same as the male-to-female ratio of the general population in China. However, only 71.25% of the general population retained HBV immune protection. Genotype  and C were identified as the most common agents; recombinant /C and /D also existed; some cases, however, could not be genotyped. NAs resistant mutation occurrence patterns were multitudinous; single mutation patterns of rtM204I/V and rtL180M occurrences accounted for majority, followed by the combinational mutation pattern L180M + M204I/V. Drug-resistance was prevalent, mainly occurring in the cross resistance patterns LAM + LdT and LAM + LdT + ETV, and significantly more critical in males. These results demonstrate that all people free from HBV infection should obtain injections of the vaccine or booster shots, and conventional virologic detection in a clinical laboratory center should incorporate genotype and mutation alongside the serological factors for etiology and develop better classification methods, such as sequencing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612680>[Effect of transfusing blood components containing  on  infection in BALB/c mice].</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effects of intravenous injection of different blood components containing  on  infection in mice.Healthy mice were infected with , and then blood samples were collected from the mouse orbit to prepare whole blood, serum-free blood components and pure red blood cells containing .

Acaricide application, which is currently the mainstay of tick control, is hampered by high cost, the need for regular application and a selection of multi-acaricide resistant tick populations. In light of this, future tick control approaches are poised to rely on the integration of rational acaricide application and other methods, such as vaccination. To contribute to systematic research-guided efforts to produce anti-tick vaccines, we carried out an  analysis of tick aquaporin-1 (AQP1) protein in order to identify tick-specific AQP1 peptide motifs that can be used in future peptide anti-tick vaccine development. We carried out multiple sequence alignment (MSA), motif analysis, homology modeling, and structural analysis to identify tick-specific AQP1 peptide motifs. BepiPred, Chou and Fasman-Turn, Karplus and Schulz Flexibility, and Parker-Hydrophilicity prediction models were used to predict these motifs' potential to induce  cell mediated immune responses. The tick AQP1 (GenBankID: QDO67142.1) protein was largely similar to the bovine AQP1 (PDB:1J4N) (23 % sequence similarity; Structural superimposition of the homology model and 14JN homotetramers gave an RMSD = 3.269 while superimposition of a single chain gave an RMSD = 1.475). Tick and bovine AQP1 transmembrane domains were largely similar while their extracellular and cytoplasmic domain loops showed variation. Two tick-specific AQP1 peptide motifs; M7 (residues 106-125,  = 5.4e-25), and M8 (residues 85-104,  = 3.3e-24) were identified. These two motifs are located on the extra-cellular AQP1 domain. Motifs; M7 and M8 showed the highest Parker-Hydrophilicity prediction immunogenicity scores of 1.784 and 1.536, respectively. These two motifs can be a good starting point for the development of potential tick AQP1 peptide-based anti-tick vaccines. Further analyses such as molecular dynamics,  assays, and  immunization assays are required to validate these findings.Copyright © 2019 Ndekezi, Nkamwesiga, Ochwo, Kimuda, Mwiine, Tweyongyere, Amanyire and Muhanguzi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642539>Serum HBV Pregenomic RNA Is Correlated with Th1/Th2  in Treatment-Naïve Chronic Hepatitis  Patients.</a></h2><p>Hepatitis  virus (HBV) load and antigens are related to the innate and adaptive  of chronic hepatitis  (CHB) patients. As a new HBV biomarker, the role of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) in host  is not known. This study aimed to identify the relationship between serum HBV pgRNA and host  in CHB patients.Two hundred and twenty-five treatment-naïve CHB patients were enrolled. Serum cytokines were measured by cytokine antibody array (Luminex multiplex platform). Th1 (T helper cell, Th) and Th2 cells were tested by flowcytometry. Serum HBV pgRNA was detected by RT-PCR.Serum HBV pgRNA was significantly different among patients in different disease phases and significantly associated with both HBV antigens and antibodies. Serum HBV pgRNA was positively correlated with the HBsAg level (p<0.001) and the presence of HBeAg (p<0.001). Patients with higher HBcAb levels showed lower serum HBV pgRNA levels (p=0.003). Notably, HBsAb positivity was associated with higher levels of serum HBV pgRNA in HBeAg(-) patients (p=0.049). Serum HBV pgRNA was positively associated with ALT level, Th2 cell frequency, and related cytokine sCD30 (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p=0.003, respectively), but negatively associated with Th1-related cytokine IL-12P70 and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) (p=0.017 and <0.001, respectively).Our study confirmed the relationship between serum HBV pgRNA and host . The results demonstrated that serum HBV pgRNA is positively correlated with Th2  but negatively correlated with Th1 , indicating that it might have a relationship with HBV antigen conversion and CTL immunodeficiency in CHB patients.

The accurate interpretation of AIRR-seq data depends on the existence of comprehensive germline gene reference sets. Current sets are known to be incomplete and unrepresentative of the degree of polymorphism and diversity in human and animal populations. A key issue is the complexity of the genomic regions in which they lie, which, because of the presence of multiple repeats, insertions and deletions, have not proved tractable with short-read whole genome sequencing. Recently, tools and methods for inferring such gene sequences from AIRR-seq datasets have become available, and a community approach has been developed for the expert review and publication of such inferences. Here, we present OGRDB, the Open Germline Receptor Database (https://ogrdb.airr-community.org), a public resource for the submission, review and publication of previously unknown receptor germline sequences together with supporting evidence.© The Author(s) 2019.

While the initial presentation is mostly characterized by a relapsing-remitting disease, patients often progress naturally after 10-15 years to a secondary-progressive disease course. Another 10-15% present with an initial, primary-progressive MS course. Pathogenic mechanisms possibly driving progression include continued compartmentalized inflammation by T- and -lymphocytes and cells of innate , oxidative stress, iron accumulation, and consecutive mitochondrial damage, altogether leading to neurodegeneration with accumulation of disability. Increasing knowledge about pathogenic mechanisms involved in progressive MS helps to design more specific and precise therapeutic approaches. Successful examples are the -cell targeting monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab, effective in primary progressive MS, and the sphingosine-1-receptor modulator siponimod, effective in active forms of secondary-progressive MS. Apart from that, other medications such as the -cell targeted antibody ofatumumab, cladribine due to T- and -cell depletion, and other sphingosine-1-receptor modulators such as ozanimod and ponesimod are under development. Moreover, some therapeutic approaches in preclinical stages are under development. In this review, we will summarize the newest therapeutic development in the field of progressive MS of the last 3 years, and shed light on auspicious substances with similar mechanisms and new developments in the therapeutic pipeline, presumably supporting a bright future for progressive MS treatment.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628657>Structural Insight of Gasdermin Family Driving Pyroptotic Cell Death.</a></h2><p>Gasdermin is a recently identified family of pore-forming proteins consisting of Gasdermin A (GSDMA), Gasdermin  (GSDMB), Gasdermin C (GSDMC), Gasdermin D (GSDMD), Gasdermin E (GSDME), and DFNB59. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a downstream effector of inflammasomes, which are supramolecular complexes that activate inflammatory caspases (-1, -4, and -5 in human and -1 and -11 in mouse). GSDMD contains a functionally important N-terminal domain (GSDMD-N), a C-terminal domain, and a linker in between that is recognized and cleaved by the activated inflammatory caspases. Upon cleavage, the GSDMD-N fragments translocate on the membrane and oligomerize to form membrane-embedded pores after specifically binding to acidic lipids such as phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylserine (PS), and cardiolipin. The pore exhibits strong membrane-disrupting cytotoxicity in mammalian cells by disrupting the osmotic potential and also serves as a gate for extracellular release of mature IL-1β and IL-18 during pyroptosis.

Barcoded viruses are generated by inserting a small, genetically unique tag into the viral genome, which is retained in progeny virus. We recently reported barcoding the well-characterized molecular clone SIVmac239, resulting in a synthetic swarm (SIVmac239M) containing approximately 10,000 distinct viral clonotypes for which all genetic differences where within a 34-base barcode that can be tracked using next generation deep sequencing. Here, we assessed the population size, distribution, and authenticity of individual viral clonotypes within this synthetic swarm using samples from 120 rhesus macaques infected intravenously. The number of replicating barcodes in plasma correlated with infectious inoculum dose, and the primary viral growth rate was similar in all infected animals regardless of inoculum size. Overall, 97% of detectable clonotypes in the viral stock were identified in the plasma of at least one infected animal. Additionally, we prepared a second generation barcoded SIVmac239 (SIVmac239M2), with over 16-times the number of barcoded variants of the original stock, and an additional barcoded stock with suboptimal nucleotides corrected (SIVmac239Opt5M). We also generated four barcoded stocks from subtype  and C SHIV clones. These new SHIV clones may be particularly valuable models to evaluate Env-targeting approaches to study viral transmission or viral reservoir clearance. Overall, this work further establishes the reliability of the barcoded virus approach and highlights the feasibility of adapting this technique to other viral clones. We recently developed and published a description of a barcoded simian immunodeficiency virus that has a short random sequence inserted directly into the viral genome. This allows for the tracking of individual viral lineages with high fidelity and ultradeep sensitivity. This virus was used to infect 120 rhesus macaques and we report here the analysis of the barcodes of these animals during primary infection. We found that the vast majority of barcodes were functional in vivo. We then expanded the barcoding approach in a second generation SIVmac239 (SIVmac239M2), with over 16-times the number of barcoded variants of the original stock, and a barcoded stock of SIVmac239Opt5M that has 5 changes from wild type SIVmac239. We also generated 4 barcoded stocks from subtype  and C SHIV clones each containing an HIV-1 envelope. These virus models are functional and can be useful for studying viral transmission and HIV cure/reservoir research.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560730>Oregano essential oil vapour prevents Plasmopara viticola infection in grapevine (Vitis Vinifera) and primes plant  mechanisms.</a></h2><p>The reduction of synthetic fungicides in agriculture is necessary to guarantee a sustainable production that protects the environment and consumers' health. Downy mildew caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola is the major pathogen in viticulture worldwide and responsible for up to 60% of pesticide treatments. Alternatives to reduce fungicides are thus utterly needed to ensure sustainable vineyard-ecosystems, consumer health and public acceptance. Essential oils (EOs) are amongst the most promising natural plant protection alternatives and have shown their antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties on several agricultural crops. However, the efficiency of EOs highly depends on timing, application method and the molecular interactions between the host, the pathogen and EO. Despite proven EO efficiency, the underlying processes are still not understood and remain a black box. The objectives of the present study were: a) to evaluate whether a continuous fumigation of a particular EO can control downy mildew in order to circumvent the drawbacks of direct application, ) to decipher molecular mechanisms that could be triggered in the host and the pathogen by EO application and c) to try to differentiate whether essential oils directly repress the oomycete or act as plant resistance primers. To achieve this a custom-made climatic chamber was constructed that enabled a continuous fumigation of potted vines with different EOs during long-term experiments. The grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cv Chasselas was chosen in reason of its high susceptibility to Plasmopara viticola. Grapevine cuttings were infected with P. viticola and subsequently exposed to continuous fumigation of different EOs at different concentrations, during 2 application time spans (24 hours and 10 days). Experiments were stopped when infection symptoms were clearly observed on the leaves of the control plants. Plant physiology (photosynthesis and growth rate parameters) were recorded and leaves were sampled at different time points for subsequent RNA extraction and transcriptomics analysis. Strikingly, the Oregano vulgare EO vapour treatment during 24h post-infection proved to be sufficient to reduce downy mildew development by 95%. Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 24h and 10d treatments and used for whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq). Sequenced reads were then mapped onto the V. vinifera and P. viticola genomes. Less than 1% of reads could be mapped onto the P. viticola genome from treated samples, whereas up to 30% reads from the controls mapped onto the P. viticola genome, thereby confirming the visual observation of P. viticola absence in the treated plants. On average, 80% of reads could be mapped onto the V. vinifera genome for differential expression analysis, which yielded 4800 modulated genes. Transcriptomic data clearly showed that the treatment triggered the plant's innate immune system with genes involved in salicylic, jasmonic acid and ethylene synthesis and signaling, activating Pathogenesis-Related-proteins as well as phytoalexin synthesis. These results elucidate EO-host-pathogen interactions for the first time and indicate that the antifungal efficiency of EO is mainly due to the triggering of resistance pathways inside the host plants. This is of major importance for the production and research on biopesticides, plant stimulation products and for resistance-breeding strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665431>PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE 3 (PIP3) modulates  in Arabidopsis thaliana.</a></h2><p>Small post-translationally modified peptides are important signalling components of plant defence responses against phytopathogens, acting both as positive and negative modulators. PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE (PIP) 1 and 2 has been shown to amplify plant . Here we investigate the role of the related peptide PIP3 in the regulation of immune response in Arabidopsis. Treatment with synthetic PIP peptides led to similar transcriptome reprogramming, indicating an effect on innate -related processes and phytohormones, including jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signalling. PIP3 overexpressing (OX) plants showed enhanced growth inhibition in response to flg22 exposure. In addition, flg22-induced production of reactive oxygen species and callose deposition were significantly reduced in PIP3-OX plants. Interestingly, PIP3-OX plants showed increased susceptibility both toward Botrytis cinerea and the biotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Expression of both JA and salicylic acid biosynthesis and signalling genes was more induced during . cinerea infection in PIP3-OX plants compared with wild-type plants. Promoter and ChIP-seq analyses indicated that the transcription factors WRKY18, WRKY33 and WRKY40 cooperatively act as repressors for PIP3. The results point to a fine-tuning role for PIP3 in modulation of  through the regulation of SA and JA biosynthesis and signalling pathways in Arabidopsis.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, little is known about how vaccination impacts the selective pressures acting on the classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Here we use high-throughput sequencing of viral genomes to investigate evolutionary changes in virus populations following the challenge of naïve and vaccinated pigs with the highly virulent CSFV strain "Koslov". The challenge inoculum contained an ensemble of closely related viral sequences, with three major haplotypes being present, termed A, , and C. After the challenge, the viral haplotype A was preferentially located within the tonsils of naïve animals but was highly prevalent in the sera of all vaccinated animals. We find that the viral population structure in naïve pigs after infection is very similar to that in the original inoculum. In contrast, the viral population in vaccinated pigs, which only underwent transient low-level viremia, displayed several distinct changes including the emergence of 16 unique non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were not detectable in the challenge inoculum. Further analysis showed a significant loss of heterogeneity and an increasing positive selection acting on the virus populations in the vaccinated pigs. We conclude that vaccination imposes a strong selective pressure on viruses that subsequently replicate within the vaccinated animal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562654>Protein kinase  controls Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth via phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator Lsr2 at threonine 112.</a></h2><p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is able to persist in the body through months of multi-drug therapy. Mycobacteria possess a wide range of regulatory proteins, including the protein kinase  (PknB) which controls peptidoglycan biosynthesis during growth. Here, we observed that depletion of PknB resulted in specific transcriptional changes that are likely caused by reduced phosphorylation of the H-NS-like regulator Lsr2 at threonine 112. The activity of PknB towards this phosphosite was confirmed with purified proteins, and this site was required for adaptation of Mtb to hypoxic conditions, and growth on solid media. Like H-NS, Lsr2 binds DNA in sequence-dependent and non-specific modes. PknB phosphorylation of Lsr2 reduced DNA binding, measured by fluorescence anisotropy and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and our NMR structure of phosphomimetic T112D Lsr2 suggests that this may be due to increased dynamics of the DNA-binding domain. Conversely, the phosphoablative T112A Lsr2 had increased binding to certain DNA sites in ChIP-sequencing, and Mtb containing this variant showed transcriptional changes that correspond with the change in DNA binding. In summary, PknB controls Mtb growth and adaptations to the changing host environment by phosphorylating the global transcriptional regulator Lsr2.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608409>CMV seropositivity is associated with increased microbial translocation in people living with HIV and uninfected controls.</a></h2><p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity and anti-CMV IgG levels are associated with adverse health outcomes in elderly populations. Among people living with HIV (PLWH) CMV seropositivity has been associated with persistent CD8 T-cell elevation and increased risk of developing non-AIDS comorbidities despite long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART). Herein, we investigated whether CMV seropositivity and elevation of anti-CMV IgG levels were associated with increased epithelial gut damage, microbial translocation, and systemic inflammation.A total of 150 PLWH (79 ART-naïve and 71 ART-treated) were compared to 26 HIV-uninfected controls (UC). Plasma markers of HIV disease progression, epithelial gut damage, microbial translocation, non-specific  cell activation, anti-CMV and anti-EBV IgG levels, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured.CMV seropositivity and elevated anti-CMV IgG levels were associated with markers of epithelial gut damage, microbial translocation, and inflammation in PLWH and HIV-uninfected participants. In contrast, total non-specific IgG, IgM, IgA, and anti-EBV IgG levels were not associated with these markers. CMV seropositivity was associated with markers of epithelial gut damage, microbial translocation, and inflammation independently of sociodemographic and behavioural characteristics of the study population.CMV-seropositive people with and without HIV had increased epithelial gut damage, microbial translocation, and inflammation. Furthermore, anti-CMV IgG levels were independently associated with increased epithelial gut damage and microbial translocation. CMV co-infection may partially explain persistent gut damage, microbial translocation, and inflammation in ART-treated PLWH.© The Author(s) 2019.

Many bioactive compounds in breast milk, such as growth factors and adipokines, contribute to the immune system's maturation in early life. However, studies on the immunoregulatory activity in preterm neonates are practically nonexistent. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a nutritional supplementation in early life with leptin or epidermal growth factor (EGF) was able to promote the maturation of the systemic and intestinal immune system in preterm conditions. For this purpose, premature rats were daily supplemented by oral gavage with leptin or EGF. Term and Preterm groups receiving vehicle were used as controls. Preterm rats showed deficiencies compared to full-term ones, such as lower body weights, erythrocyte counts, plasma IgG and IgM concentrations and  cell percentages, and higher values of Th and Tc TCRαβ cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, and intestinal permeability, among others. However, leptin and EGF supplementation were able to revert some of these deficiencies and to improve the premature immune system's development. These results suggest that leptin and EGF are involved in enhancing the maturation of the systemic and intestinal immune system in preterm conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600121>Pathogenesis of HIV-related lung disease: , infection, and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Despite anti-retroviral therapy (ART), HIV-related pulmonary disease continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality for people living with HIV (PLWH). The spectrum of lung diseases has changed from acute opportunistic infections resulting in death to chronic lung diseases for those with access to ART. Chronic immune activation and suppression can result in impairment of innate  and progressive loss of T cell and  cell functionality with aberrant cytokine and chemokine responses systemically as well as in the lung. HIV can be detected in the lungs of PLWH and has profound effects on cellular immune functions. In addition, HIV-related lung injury and disease can occur secondary to a number of mechanisms including altered pulmonary and systemic inflammatory pathways, viral persistence in the lung, oxidative stress with additive effects of smoke exposure, microbial translocation, and alterations in the lung and gut microbiome. Although ART has had profound effects on systemic viral suppression in HIV, the impact of ART on lung immunology still needs to be fully elucidated. Understanding of the mechanisms by which HIV-related lung diseases continue to occur is critical to the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies to improve lung health in PLWH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665236>Maternal antibodies against influenza in cord blood and protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza in infants.</a></h2><p>Studies that correlate maternal antibodies with protection from influenza A or  virus infection in young infants in areas with prolonged influenza circulation are lacking.We conducted a prospective, observational study to evaluate the effects of maternal-transferred antibodies against influenza A and  viruses against laboratory-confirmed influenza in a cohort born over 24 months. Cord blood samples were retrieved at birth and infants were actively followed for the first 6 months of life. Nasal swabs were collected and tested for influenza A and  by RT-PCR whenever an illness episode was identified. Cord blood samples were tested by the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay to viruses that circulated during the follow-up period.1162 infants were born to 1140 recruited women: 1092 (94%) infants completed 6 months of follow-up. Proportions of cord blood with HAI antibodies titers ≥40 against A(H1N1), A(H3N2), /Victoria and /Yamagata were 31%, 24%, 31% and 54%, respectively. Only 4% of women had maternal influenza vaccination. Cord blood antigen-specific HAI titers ≥40 were found to correlate with protection from infection only for influenza /Yamagata. No influenza  virus infection occurred in infants ≤60 days of life. Proportional hazards analysis showed that a cord blood HAI titer of 40 was associated with 83% (95% confidence interval: 44%, 95%) reduction in the risk of influenza /Yamagata infections compared to a cord blood titer <10.We documented that maternal  against influenza /Yamagata was conferred to infants within the first 6 months of life.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, it is not clear whether they are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A hospital-based case-control study, including 862 cases with HCC and 1120 controls, was conducted to assess the effects of 258 SNPs in the coding regions of ADAMTS4 on HCC risk and prognosis. We found that six SNPs in ADAMTS4 were differential distribution between cases and controls via the primary screening analyses; however, only rs538321148 and rs1014509103 polymorphisms were further identified to modify the risk of HCC (odds ratio: 2.73 and 2.95; 95% confidence interval, 2.28-3.29 and 2.43-3.58; P-value, 5.73 × 10 and 1.36 × 10 , respectively). Significant interaction between these two SNPs and two known causes of hepatitis  virus and aflatoxin B1 were also observed. Furthermore, rs538321148 and rs1014509103 polymorphisms were associated not only with clinicopathological features of tumor such as tumor stage and grade, microvessel density, and vessel metastasis, but with poor overall survival. Additionally, these SNPs significantly downregulated ADATMS4 expression in tumor tissues. These data suggest that SNPs in the coding region of ADAMTS4, such as rs538321148 and rs1014509103, may be potential biomarkers for predicting HCC risk and prognosis.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we performed an in silico based proteome-wide screening for antigenic -cell derived T-cell epitopes and their following use to design a multi-epitope peptide vaccine that can effectively engage the host immune system against Acinetobacter nosocomialis SSA3 strain. Epitopes of the fimbrial biogenesis outer membrane usher FimD protein: YQQGINNYL and YRTNYTTVG were revealed appropriate for multi-epitope peptide construct designing. This protein has no homology to the host, essential to the pathogen survival and is localized at the pathogen surface.

Therefore, a better stratification of patients and the development of novel therapeutic protocols are crucially needed. The importance of tumor-infiltrating  cells (TIL-Bs) in shaping antitumor  remains unclear; therefore, we analyzed frequency, phenotype, prognostic value and possible roles of TIL-Bs in OPSCC.We utilized transcriptomic analysis of immune response-related genes in 18 OPSCC samples with respect to human papillomavirus (HPV) status. The density and localization of CD20, CD8 and DC-LAMP cells were subsequently analyzed in 72 tissue sections of primary OPSCC samples in relation to patients' prognosis. The immunohistochemical approach was supplemented by flow cytometry-based analysis of phenotype and functionality of TIL-Bs in freshly resected primary OPSCC tissues.We observed significantly higher expression of  cell-related genes and higher densities of CD20  cells in HPV-associated OPSCC samples. Interestingly, CD20 TIL-Bs and CD8 T cells formed non-organized aggregates with interacting cells within the tumor tissue. The densities of both intraepithelial CD20  cells and  cell/CD8 T cell interactions showed prognostic significance, which surpassed HPV positivity and CD8 TIL density in stratification of OPSCC patients. High density of TIL-Bs was associated with an activated  cell phenotype, high CXCL9 production and high levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Importantly, the abundance of direct  cell/CD8 T cell interactions positively correlated with the frequency of HPV16-specific CD8 T cells, whereas the absence of  cells in tumor-derived cell cultures markedly reduced CD8 T cell survival.Our results indicate that high abundance of TIL-Bs and high density of direct  cell/CD8 T cell interactions can predict patients with excellent prognosis, who would benefit from less invasive treatment. We propose that in extensively infiltrated tumors, TIL-Bs might recruit CD8 T cells via CXCL9 and due to a highly activated phenotype contribute by secondary costimulation to the maintenance of CD8 T cells in the tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581724>Using the Immunophenotype to Predict Response to Biologic Drugs in Rheumatoid Arthritis.</a></h2><p>Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α is a key mediator of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, and its discovery led to the development of highly successful anti-TNF therapy.

Not all patients respond to a biologic drug, leading to a knowledge gap between biologic therapies available and the confident prediction of response. So far, genetic studies have failed to uncover clinically informative biomarkers to predict response.

To further improve response rates, we explored combining anti-CTLA4 blockade with antisense suppression of CD47, an inhibitory receptor on T cells that limit T-cell receptor signaling and killing of irradiated target cells. Human melanoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed positive correlations between CD47 mRNA expression and expression of T-cell regulators including CTLA4 and its counter receptors CD80 and CD86. Antisense suppression of CD47 on human T cells in vitro using a translational blocking morpholino (CD47 m) alone or combined with anti-CTLA4 enhanced antigen-dependent killing of irradiated melanoma cells. Correspondingly, the treatment of locally irradiated B16F10 melanomas in C57BL/6 mice using combined blockade of CD47 and CTLA4 significantly increased the survival of mice relative to either treatment alone. CD47 m alone or in combination with anti-CTLA4 increased CD3 T-cell infiltration in irradiated tumors. Anti-CTLA4 also increased CD3 and CD8 T-cell infiltration as well as markers of NK cells in non-irradiated tumors. Anti-CTLA4 combined with CD47 m resulted in the greatest increase in intratumoral granzyme , interferon-γ, and NK-cell marker mRNA expression.

However, the transmission of CRE between humans and animals has not yet been well studied.We investigated the prevalence, risk factors, and drivers of CRE transmission between humans and their backyard animals in rural China.We conducted a comprehensive sampling strategy in 12 villages in Shandong, China. Using the household [residents and their backyard animals (farm and companion animals)] as a single surveillance unit, we assessed the prevalence of CRE at the household level and examined the factors associated with CRE carriage through a detailed questionnaire. Genetic relationships among human- and animal-derived CRE were assessed using whole-genome sequencing-based molecular methods.A total of 88 New Delhi -type carbapenem-resistant  (NDM-EC), including 17 from humans, 44 from pigs, 12 from chickens, 1 from cattle, and 2 from dogs, were isolated from 65 of the 746 households examined. The remaining 12 NDM-EC were from flies in the immediate backyard environment. The NDM-EC colonization in households was significantly associated with ) the number of species of backyard animals raised/kept in the same household, and ) the use of human and/or animal feces as fertilizer. Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) revealed that a large proportion of the core genomes of the NDM-EC belonged to strains from hosts other than their own, and several human isolates shared closely related core single-nucleotide polymorphisms and  genetic contexts with isolates from backyard animals.To our knowledge, we are the first to report evidence of direct transmission of NDM-EC between humans and animals.

Natural infection is known to induce a protective mucosal . Therefore, in this study, we aimed to use acellular pertussis vaccines to recapitulate these mucosal immune responses. We utilized a murine immunization and challenge model to characterize the efficacy of intranasal immunization (IN) with DTaP vaccine or DTaP vaccine supplemented with curdlan, a known Th1/Th17 promoting adjuvant. Protection from IN delivered DTaP was compared to protection mediated by intraperitoneal injection of DTaP and whole-cell pertussis vaccines. We tracked fluorescently labeled DTaP after immunization and detected that DTaP localized preferentially in the lungs while DTaP with curdlan was predominantly in the nasal turbinates. IN immunization with DTaP, with or without curdlan adjuvant, resulted in anti- and anti-pertussis toxin IgG titers at the same level as intraperitoneally administered DTaP. IN immunization was able to protect against  challenge and we observed decreased pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltrates in the lung, and bacterial burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract at day 3 post challenge. Furthermore, IN immunization with DTaP triggered mucosal immune responses such as production of -specific IgA, and increased IL-17A. Together, the induction of a mucosal immune response and humoral antibody-mediated protection associated with an IN administered DTaP and curdlan adjuvant warrant further exploration as a pertussis vaccine candidate formulation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649669>Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Metastatic Melanoma Turns "Non-T Cell Inflamed" Into "T-Cell Inflamed" Tumors.</a></h2><p>Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination effectively induces anti-tumor , although in the majority of cases this does not translate into a durable clinical response. However, DC vaccination is characterized by a robust safety profile, making this treatment a potential candidate for effective combination cancer immunotherapy. To explore this possibility, understanding changes occurring in the tumor microenvironment (TME) upon DC vaccination is required. In this line, quantitative and qualitative changes in tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) induced by vaccination with autologous tumor lysate/homogenate loaded DCs were investigated in a series of 16 patients with metastatic melanoma. Immunohistochemistry for CD4, CD8, Foxp3, Granzyme  (GZMB), PDL1, and HLA class I was performed in tumor biopsies collected before and after DC vaccination. The density of each marker was quantified by automated digital pathology analysis on whole slide images. Co-expression of markers defining functional phenotypes, i.e., Foxp3 regulatory CD4 T cells (Treg) and GZMB cytotoxic CD8 T cells, was assessed with sequential immunohistochemistry. A significant increase of CD8 TILs was found in post-vaccine biopsies of patients who were not previously treated with immune-modulating cytokines or Ipilimumab. Interestingly, along with a maintained tumoral HLA class I expression, after DC vaccination we observed a significant increase of PDL1 tumor cells, which significantly correlated with intratumoral CD8 T cell density. This observation might explain the lack of a significant concurrent cytotoxic reactivation of CD8 T cell, as measured by the numbers of GZMB T cells. Altogether these findings indicate that DC vaccination exerts an important role in sustaining or  inducing a T cell inflamed TME. However, the strength of the intratumoral T cell activation detected in post-DC therapy lesions is lessened by an occurring phenomenon of adaptive immune resistance, yet the concomitant PDL1 up-regulation. Overall, this study sheds light on DC immunotherapy-induced TME changes, lending the rationale for the design of smarter immune-combination therapies.Copyright © 2019 Bulgarelli, Tazzari, Granato, Ridolfi, Maiocchi, de Rosa, Petrini, Pancisi, Gentili, Vergani, Piccinini, Carbonaro, Leone, Foschi, Ancarani, Framarini and Guidoboni.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640857>Upregulation of cellulase activity and mRNA levels by bacterial challenge in the earthworm Eisenia andrei, supporting the involvement of cellulases in innate .</a></h2><p>To investigate whether earthworm cellulases contribute to the innate immune system, the responsiveness of cellulase activity and mRNA expression to bacterial challenge was examined by zymography and RNA sequencing. A zymographic analysis revealed that the activity levels of earthworm cellulases were upregulated in response to either a bacterial (Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli) or LPS challenge.

Insight on HBV evolutionary history in the region is limited. We performed a comprehensive epidemiological and phylogenetic reconstruction based on a large cohort of HBV infected patients. Three hundred and nineteen HBV-infected patients with different clinical manifestations, including inactive and active chronic carriers and patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), were enrolled in this study. The full-length large S gene was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine the genotype and subgenotypes of the isolates. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that genotype D is the most dominant genotype among patients. Moreover, this analysis identified two strains with genotype E isolated from active carriers. Detailed phylogenetic analyses confirmed the presence of four HBV D subgenotypes, D1 (93%, n = 296), D2 (0.02%, n = 5), D3 (0.003%, n = 1), and D4 (0.003%, n = 1). In addition, six genotype D strains were not assigned to any existing HBV D subgenotype. The large S gene of eight strains showed signatures of genotype recombination between the genotypes D and A and between D and E. Several strains harbored medically important point mutations at the protein level. Along with the dominance of the HBV genotype D, isolation of the E genotype and several recombinant strains from patients with Saudi Arabian origin is an essential result for decisions involving therapeutic measures for patients. Development of vaccines and detection of diagnostic escape mutations at antigenic epitopes on the HBsAg will be valuable to public health authorities. Furthermore, the diversity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels and different proportions of dN/dS at the PreS1, PreS2, and HBsAg reveal the selective pressure trend from inactive status towards advanced liver diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, revaccination post-HCT is of major importance. In Denmark, a vaccination schedule with fewer doses post-HCT has been used, including two doses for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella, and one dose only for Haemophilus influenzae type . The background for this was the presumption that post-HCT immunization constituted booster vaccination of donor . Our objective was to evaluate the proportion of children protected after the scheduled vaccination programme. A nationwide retrospective cohort study of all children who have received an HCT in Denmark during 1994-2012. Antibody levels were analysed in blood samples drawn before and after vaccination, and the probability of achieving protection after the scheduled immunization programme was estimated. A total of 198 children were included. The protection post-immunization was as follows: diphtheria 75.3%, tetanus 89.1%, polio 97.7%, and Haemophilus influenzae type  94.8%. For diphtheria and tetanus, the probability of achieving protection increased to 93.8% and 97.3%, respectively, after a third dose. For measles, mumps, and rubella, the probability of achieving protection was 89.4%, 80.9%, and 94.2%, respectively. In conclusion, our findings support a more extensive vaccination schedule including three doses for diphtheria and tetanus which are in line with current international guidelines.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665779>The Severe Typhoid Fever in Africa Program: Study Design and Methodology to Assess Disease Severity, Host , and Carriage Associated With Invasive Salmonellosis.</a></h2><p>Invasive salmonellosis is a common community-acquired bacteremia in persons residing in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is a paucity of data on severe typhoid fever and its associated acute and chronic host immune response and carriage. The Severe Typhoid Fever in Africa (SETA) program, a multicountry surveillance study, aimed to address these research gaps and contribute to the control and prevention of invasive salmonellosis.A prospective healthcare facility-based surveillance with active screening of enteric fever and clinically suspected severe typhoid fever with complications was performed using a standardized protocol across the study sites in Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar, and Nigeria. Defined inclusion criteria were used for screening of eligible patients for enrollment into the study. Enrolled patients with confirmed invasive salmonellosis by blood culture or patients with clinically suspected severe typhoid fever with perforation were eligible for clinical follow-up. Asymptomatic neighborhood controls and immediate household contacts of each case were enrolled as a comparison group to assess the level of Salmonella-specific antibodies and shedding patterns. Healthcare utilization surveys were performed to permit adjustment of incidence estimations. Postmortem questionnaires were conducted in medically underserved areas to assess death attributed to invasive Salmonella infections in selected sites.Research data generated through SETA aimed to address scientific knowledge gaps concerning the severe typhoid fever and mortality, long-term host immune responses, and bacterial shedding and carriage associated with natural infection by invasive salmonellae.SETA supports public health policy on typhoid immunization strategy in Africa.© The Author(s) 2019.

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hIVIG in a randomised controlled trial.This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was planned for 45 hospitals in Argentina, Australia, Denmark, Greece, Mexico, Spain, Thailand, UK, and the USA over five influenza seasons from 2013-14 to 2017-18. Adults (≥18 years of age) were admitted for hospital treatment with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or  infection and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard care plus either a single 500-mL infusion of high-titre hIVIG (0·25 g/kg bodyweight, 24·75 g maximum; hIVIG group) or saline placebo (placebo group). Eligible patients had a National Early Warning score of 2 points or greater at the time of screening and their symptoms began no more than 7 days before randomisation. Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded, as well as any patients for whom the treatment would present a health risk. Separate randomisation schedules were generated for each participating clinical site using permuted block randomisation. Treatment assignments were obtained using a web-based application by the site pharmacist who then masked the solution for infusion. Patients and investigators were masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was a six-category ordinal outcome of clinical status at day 7, ranging in severity from death to resumption of normal activities after discharge. The choice of day 7 was based on haemagglutination inhibition titres from a pilot study. It was analysed with a proportional odds model, using all six categories to estimate a common odds ratio (OR). An OR greater than 1 indicated that, for a given category, patients in the hIVIG group were more likely to be in a better category than those in the placebo group. Prespecified primary analyses for safety and efficacy were based on patients who received an infusion and for whom eligibility could be confirmed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, .313 patients were enrolled in 34 sites between Dec 11, 2014, and May 28, 2018. We also used data from 16 patients enrolled at seven of the 34 sites during the pilot study between Jan 15, 2014, and April 10, 2014. 168 patients were randomly assigned to the hIVIG group and 161 to the placebo group. 21 patients were excluded (12 from the hIVIG group and 9 from the placebo group) because they did not receive an infusion or their eligibility could not be confirmed. Thus, 308 were included in the primary analysis. hIVIG treatment produced a robust rise in haemagglutination inhibition titres against influenza A and smaller rises in influenza  titres. Based on the proportional odds model, the OR on day 7 was 1·25 (95% CI 0·79-1·97; p=0·33). In subgroup analyses for the primary outcome, the OR in patients with influenza A was 0·94 (0·55-1·59) and was 3·19 (1·21-8·42) for those with influenza  (interaction p=0·023). Through 28 days of follow-up, 47 (30%) of 156 patients in the hIVIG group and in 45 (30%) of 152 patients in the placebo group had the composite safety outcome of death, a serious adverse event, or a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (hazard ratio [HR] 1·06, 95% CI 0·70-1·60; p=0·79). Six (4%) patients in the hIVIG group and five (3%) in the placebo group died, but these deaths were not necessarily related to treatment.When administered alongside standard care (most commonly oseltamivir), hIVIG was not superior to placebo for adults hospitalised with influenza infection. By contrast with our prespecified subgroup hypothesis that hIVIG would result in more favourable responses in patients with influenza A than , we found the opposite effect. The clinical benefit of hIVIG for patients with influenza  is supported by antibody affinity analyses, but confirmation is warranted.NIAID and NIH.

These proteins form an integral part of the architectural protein repertoire to support chromatin structure in the nucleus. In the nucleus, the role of HMGB1 is attributed to its ability to bind to undamaged DNA, damaged DNA, and alternative (i.e. non-) DNA structures with high affinity and subsequently induce bending of the DNA substrates. Due to its binding to DNA, HMGB1 has been implicated in critical biological processes, such as DNA transcription, replication, repair, and recombination. In addition to its intracellular functions, HMGB1 can also be released in the extracellular space where it elicits immunological responses. HMGB1 associates with many different molecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipopolysaccharides to modulate a variety of processes in both DNA metabolism and in innate . In this review, we will focus on the implications of the interactions of HMGB1 with nucleic acids in DNA repair and immune responses. We report on the roles of HMGB1 in nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), mismatch repair (MMR) and DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR). We also report on its roles in immune responses via its potential effects on antigen receptor diversity generation [V(D)J recombination] and interactions with foreign and self-nucleic acids. HMGB1 expression is altered in a variety of cancers and immunological disorders. However, due to the diversity and complexity of the biological processes influenced by HMGB1 (and its family members), a detailed understanding of the intracellular and extracellular roles of HMGB1 in DNA damage repair and immune responses is warranted to ensure the development of effective HMGB1-related therapies.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Neoepitopes represent a viable option to induce antitumor immune responses, but they have limitations, such as low immunogenicity and tolerance induction. Parvovirus B19 virus-like particles may be used to deliver neoepitopes to prime cellular . We designed and evaluated the therapeutic effect of VP2 B19-virus-like particles, with multi-neoepitopes, in a 4T1 breast cancer model. Balb/c mice received four therapeutic immunizations with multi-neoepitopes-virus-like, wild type-virus-like, vehicle, or virus-like plus Cry1Ac adjuvant particles, intraperitoneally and peritumorally. Tumor growth, lung macro-metastasis, and specific immune responses were evaluated. Therapeutic administration of multi-epitopes virus-like particles significantly delayed tumor growth and decreased the lung macro-metastasis number, in comparison to treatment with wild type-virus-like particles, which surprisingly also elicited antitumoral effects that were improved with the adjuvant. Only treatments with multi-epitope virus-like particles induced specific proliferative responses of CD8 and CD4 T lymphocytes and Granzyme- production in lymphatic nodes local to the tumor. Treatment with recombinant multiple neoepitopes-virus-like particles induced specific cellular responses, inhibited tumor growth and macro-metastasis, thus B19-virus-like particles may function as an effective delivery system for neoepitopes for personalized immunotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, the phagocytic activities of IgM  cells under various differentiational conditions residing in peripheral blood leukocytes were investigated in a teleost fish Nile tilapia (). The IgM  cells were recognized as IgM or IgM subsets based on their membrane IgM (mIgM) levels. The mIgM, secreted IgM (sIgM), major histocompatibility complex class II and reactive oxygen species were detected. Expressions of transcription factors (Pax5 and Blimp-1) and  cell signaling molecules (CD79a, CD79b, BLNK, and LYN) suggested that IgM  cells were resembling as plasma-like cells and IgM resembling as naïve/mature  cells, respectively. Analysis of phagocytic activities demonstrated that both IgM and IgM  cells have a similar phagocytic ability (phagocytosis percentage); however, the phagocytic capacity [phagocytic index and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)] of IgM  cells was significantly higher than that of IgM  cells. Taken together, the results indicated that  cell differentiation may cause the decrease of phagocytic capacity but not phagocytic ability of phagocytic IgM  cells in teleost. The finding may provide an evolutionary evidence for understanding the greater specialization of the  cell in more sophisticated adaptive humoral , by decreasing phagocytic activity in order to contribute its function more specifically into antibody-secreting.Copyright © 2019 Wu, Kong, Yang, Bian, Wu, Li, Yin, Mu, Li and Ye.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661975>Single Cell Sequencing of Mouse Heart Immune Infiltrate in Pressure Overload-Driven Heart Failure Reveals Extent of Immune Activation.</a></h2><p> Inflammation is a key component of cardiac disease, with macrophages and T lymphocytes mediating essential roles in the progression to heart failure (HF). Nonetheless, little insight exists on other immune subsets involved in the cardiotoxic response.  Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the cardiac immune composition in the standard murine non-ischemic, pressure-overload HF model. By focusing our analysis on CD45 cells, we obtained a higher resolution identification of the immune cell subsets in the heart, at early and late stages of disease and in controls. We then integrated our findings using multi-parameter flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and tissue clarification immunofluorescence, in mouse and human.  We found that most major immune cell subpopulations, including macrophages,  cells, T cells and regulatory T cells (Treg), dendritic cells, NK cells, neutrophils and mast cells are present in both healthy and diseased hearts. Most cell subsets are found within the myocardium, whilst mast cells are found also in the epicardium. Upon induction of pressure overload, immune activation occurs across the entire range of immune cell types. Activation led to upregulation of key subset-specific molecules, such as Osm in pro-inflammatory macrophages and PD-1 in Treg, that may help explain clinical findings such as the refractivity of HF patients to anti-TNF therapy and cardiac toxicity during anti-PD-1 cancer immunotherapy, respectively.  Despite the absence of infectious agents or an autoimmune trigger, induction of disease leads to immune activation that involves far more cell types than previously thought, including neutrophils,  cells, NK cells and mast cells. This opens up the field of cardio-immunology to further investigation using toolkits that have already been developed to study the immune subsets above. The subset-specific molecules that mediate their activation may thus become useful targets for diagnostics or therapy of HF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618905>Modulation of T Regulatory and Dendritic Cell Phenotypes Following Ingestion of , AHCC and Azithromycin in Healthy Individuals.</a></h2><p>The probiotic Bifidus BB536 (BB536), which contains , has been shown to have enhanced probiotic effects when given together with a standardized extract of cultured  mycelia (AHCC, Amino Up Co.

We tested the hypothesis that orally administered BB536 and/or AHCC, results in modulation of immune effector cells with polarisation towards anti-inflammatory responses following antibiotic usage. Forty healthy male volunteers divided into 4 equal groups were randomised to receive either placebo, BB536, AHCC or a combination for 12 days in a double-blind manner. After 7 days volunteers also received 250 mg azithromycin for 5 days. Cytokine profiles from purified CD3+ T cells stimulated with PDB-ionomycin were assessed. CD4+ CD25+ forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) expression and peripheral blood DC subsets were assessed prior to treatment and subsequently at 7 and 13 days. There was no difference in cytokine secretion from stimulated CD3+ T cells between treatment groups. Compared with baseline, Foxp3 expression (0.45 ± 0.1 vs. 1.3 ± 0.4;  = 0.002) and interferon-gamma/interleukin-4 (IFN-γ/IL-4) ratios were increased post-treatment in volunteers receiving BB536 ( = 0.031), although differences between groups were not significant. For volunteers receiving combination BB536 and AHCC, there was an increase in myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) compared with plasmacytoid DC (pDC) counts (80% vs. 61%;  = 0.006) at post treatment time points. mDC2 phenotypes were more prevalent, compared with baseline, following combination treatment (0.16% vs. 0.05%;  = 0.002).

In the second experiment, live aMPV subtype  vaccine was used in place of NDV. Clinical signs were monitored daily and oropharyngeal swabs were taken at regular intervals for vaccine virus detection. Blood was collected at 21 dpv for serology. 10 chicks from each group were challenged with virulent strains of M41 or QX or aMPV subtype . For IBV, after 5 days post challenge (dpc), tracheal ciliary protection was assessed. For aMPV, clinical scores were recorded up to 10 dpc. For NDV, haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres were assayed as an indicator of protective . In both experiments, ciliary protection for IBV vaccinated groups was maintained above 90%. The protection against virulent aMPV challenge was not compromised when aMPV, H120 and CR88 were co-administered. NDV HI mean titres in single and combined NDV-vaccinated groups remained above the protective titre (>3 log). Both experiments demonstrated that simultaneous administration of live NDV VG/GA-Avinew or aMPV subtype  alongside H120 and CR88 vaccines does not interfere with protection conferred against NDV, IBV or aMPV.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Coxsackie  viruses (CVB) are common enteroviruses (EV), associated with increased incidence of severe neonatal CVB disease with potentially fatal consequences. To prevent majority of childhood gastroenteritis, we have developed a non-live NoV-RV combination vaccine consisting of NoV virus-like particles (VLPs) and RV oligomeric rVP6 protein that induced protective immune responses to NoV and RV in mice. Moreover, rVP6 acted as an adjuvant for NoV VLPs. Here, we investigated a possibility to include a third enteric virus-derived antigen in the candidate NoV-RV vaccine, by adding recombinant nanoparticles derived from EV CVB1. To examine immunogenicity of EV-NoV-RV vaccine, BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly twice with 10 µg CVB1 VLPs, GII.4 VLPs and rVP6 nanotubes, either separately or combined. To evaluate the adjuvant effect of rVP6 on EV responses, mice received 0.3 µg CVB1 VLPs with or without 10 µg rVP6. Comparable serum IgG antibodies were detected whether the antigens were administered separately or in combination. Each formulation generated IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies, indicating a mixed Th2/Th1-type response. CVB1 VLPs skewed the isotype distribution slightly towards IgG1 subtype, while EV-NoV-RV combination vaccine induced unbiased Th1/Th2 responses to CVB1. Each antigen also induced T cell mediated  measured by IFN-γ secretion to specific stimulants ex vivo. Antisera raised by single antigens and combined formulation also exhibited strong neutralizing ability against CVB1 and NoV GII.4. Further, rVP6 showed an adjuvant effect on CVB1 responses, sparing the VLP dose and homogenizing the responses. Finally, the results support inclusion of additional antigens in the candidate NoV-RV combination vaccine to combat severe childhood infections and confirm adjuvant effect of rVP6 nanostructures.Copyright © 2019.

Since, cognitive function relies on efficient communication between distributed cortical and subcortical regions, we investigated whether people with COPD have disruption in white matter connectivity.Structural networks were constructed for 30 COPD patients (aged 54-84 years, 57% male, FEV1 52.5% pred.) and 23 controls (aged 51-81 years, 48% Male). Networks comprised 90 grey matter regions (nodes) interconnected by white mater fibre tracts traced using deterministic tractography (edges). Edges were weighted by the number of streamlines adjusted for a) streamline length and ) end-node volume. White matter connectivity was quantified using global and nodal graph metrics which characterised the networks connection density, connection strength, segregation, integration, nodal influence and small-worldness. Between-group differences in white matter connectivity and within-group associations with cognitive function and disease severity were tested.COPD patients' brain networks had significantly lower global connection strength (p = 0.03) and connection density (p = 0.04). There was a trend towards COPD patients having a reduction in nodal connection density and connection strength across the majority of network nodes but this only reached significance for connection density in the right superior temporal gyrus (p = 0.02) and did not survive correction for end-node volume. There were no other significant global or nodal network differences or within-group associations with disease severity or cognitive function.COPD brain networks show evidence of damage compared to controls with a reduced number and strength of connections. This loss of connectivity was not sufficient to disrupt the overall efficiency of network organisation, suggesting that it has redundant capacity that makes it resilient to damage, which may explain why cognitive dysfunction is not severe. This might also explain why no direct relationships could be found with cognitive measures. Smoking and hypertension are known to have deleterious effects on the brain.

MKL1 is associated with hematologic malignancies and immunodeficiency, but its role in  cells is unexplored. Here we examined  cells from monozygotic triplets with an intronic deletion in MKL1, two of whom were previously treated for Hodgkin lymphoma. To investigate MKL1 and  cell responses in HL pathogenesis, we generated Epstein Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from the triplets and two controls. While cells from the Hodgkin lymphoma treated patients had a phenotype close to healthy controls, cells from the undiagnosed triplet had increased MKL1 mRNA, increased MKL1 protein, and elevated expression of MKL1-dependent genes. This was associated with elevated actin content, increased cell spreading, decreased expression of CD11a integrin molecules, and delayed aggregation. Moreover, cells from the undiagnosed triplet proliferated faster, displayed a higher proportion of cells with hyperploidy, and formed large tumors in vivo. This phenotype was reversible by inhibiting MKL1 activity. Interestingly, cells from the triplet treated for Hodgkin lymphoma in 1985 contained two subpopulations: one with high expression of CD11a that behaved like control cells and the other with low expression of CD11a that formed large tumors in vivo similar to cells from the undiagnosed triplet. This implies that pre-malignant cells had re-emerged a long time after treatment. Together, these data suggest that dysregulated MKL1 activity participates in  cell transformation and Hodgkin lymphoma pathogenesis.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655568>The anti-phytoalexin gene Bx-cathepsin W supports the survival of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus under Pinus massoniana phytoalexin stress.</a></h2><p>Pine trees challenged by Bursaphelenchus xylophilus invasion produce phytoalexins to combat this nematode.

Using tissues from uninfected and vaginally ZIKV-infected macaques and mice, we show that low basal expression of RNA-sensing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), or their co-receptors, in the LFRT contributes to high viral replication in this tissue. In the LFRT, ZIKV sensing provides limited protection against viral replication, and the sensors are also minimally induced after vaginal infection. While IFNα/β receptor signaling offers minimal protection in the LFRT, it is required to prevent dissemination of ZIKV to other tissues, including the upper FRT. Our findings support a role for RNA-sensing PRRs in the dampened innate  against ZIKV in the LFRT compared to other tissues and underlie potential implications for systemic dissemination upon heterosexual transmission of ZIKV in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597848>[The immune microenvironment in malignant lymphoma].</a></h2><p>Recent advances in immunotherapy have highlighted the importance of the tumor microenvironment. Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise from lymphocytes and typically develop in lymphoid tissues. It has been recognized that the elements of the lymphoma microenvironment are not mere bystanders to a host antitumor inflammatory response but are important components of the tumor that support proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance of lymphoma cells. Lymphoma cells have individual expression patterns of chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules, according to their histological subtypes, and the patterns of surface molecules determine the sites of tumor involvement. Lymphoma cells often depend on the signals provided by non-tumor cells, such as stromal cells and macrophages, through direct cell contact and paracrine factors. On the other hand, there are genetic and non-genetic mechanisms allowing lymphoma cells to escape from anti-tumor , such as downregulation of HLA molecules, B2M, CD58, CD70, and/or upregulation of PD-L1 and PD-L2.

The major post-splenectomy immune-defects against CMV are: weakened, delayed or absent anti-CMV IgM, and compensatory marked IgG response; severely impaired -cell and CD4, CD8 T-cells function responses; and post-splenectomy, bone marrow compensates for the absence of spleen's immune responses against CMV, mimicking a monoclonal T-cell lymphoproliferative process.The puzzled diagnosis of the CMV syndrome post-splenectomy is of the most challenging and misleading, resulting in risky and costly interventions and a subsequent prolonged hospitalization (2 months). The mounting multi-disciplinary literature evidence renders us to suggest that splenectomized individuals are not only prone to encapsulated bacteria but also behave as immunocompromised to CMV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648909>Case report of delayed seroprotection rather than non-response after primary three-dose hepatitis  vaccination.</a></h2><p>We describe a delayed hepatitis  seroprotection 12 weeks after the primary vaccination schedule in a 57-year-old male with smoldering multiple myeloma. Based on undetectable anti-HBs antibodies 6 weeks after the third vaccination, the index person was previously considered to be a hepatitis  vaccine non-responder. Because hepatitis  vaccination started in the 1980s, many hepatitis  vaccine non-responders have received a revaccination regimen.

Emerging data suggest that targeting the immune response may offer promising strategies to alleviate TBI outcomes; kahweol, an anti-inflammatory diterpene that remains in unfiltered coffee, has been shown to be beneficial in neuronal recovery. Here, we examined whether kahweol could alleviate brain trauma-induced injury in a mouse model of TBI and its underlying mechanisms. TBI was induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI) and various doses of kahweol were intraperitoneally administered following injury. Contusion volume, brain edema, neurobehavioral deficits, and protein expression and activity were evaluated in both short-term and long-term recovery. We found that kahweol treatments significantly reduced secondary brain injury and improved neurobehavioral outcomes in TBI mice. These changes were accompanied by the attenuation of proinflammatory cytokine secretion, decreased microglia/macrophage activation, and reduction of neutrophil and leukocyte infiltration. In addition, continuous kahweol treatment further improved short-term TBI outcomes compared to single-dosage. Collectively, our data showed that kahweol protects against TBI by reducing immune responses and may serve as a potential therapeutic intervention for TBI patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583949>Enteric bacteria induce IFNγ and Granzyme  from human colonic Group 1 Innate Lymphoid Cells.</a></h2><p>Group 1 Innate Lymphoid Cells (which include Natural Killer cells and ILC1s) aid in gut anti-bacterial defense through the production of IFNγ, which is critical for mobilizing protective responses against enteric pathogens. When intestinal epithelial barrier integrity is compromised, commensal bacteria are likely to translocate from the gut lumen into the lamina propria. Few studies have addressed the mechanisms by which commensal bacteria impact the function of gut Group 1 ILCs, especially ILC1s. Utilizing an  human colonic lamina propria mononuclear cell (LPMC) model, we evaluated Group 1 ILC cytokine and cytolytic protein production in response to a panel of enteric Gram-positive and Gram-negative commensal and pathogenic bacteria. IFNγ-production by NK cells and ILC1s was significantly increased after LPMC exposure to Gram-negative commensal or pathogenic bacteria, but not after exposure to the Gram-positive bacteria commensals tested. Stimulation of IFNγ production from Group 1 ILCs was not through direct recognition of bacteria by NK cells or ILC1s, but rather required accessory cells within the LPMC population. Myeloid dendritic cells generated IL-12p70, IL-18, and IL-1β upon exposure to enteric bacteria and these cytokines contributed to Group 1 ILC production of IFNγ. Furthermore, Gram-negative commensal or pathogenic bacteria induced significant expression of Granzyme  in NK cells and ILC1s. Overall, these data demonstrate that some enteric commensal bacteria indirectly induce inflammatory cytokine production and cytolytic protein expression from human colonic Group 1 ILCs, a process which could contribute to inflammation in the setting of microbial translocation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575775>Establishment of Chronic Typhoid Infection in a Mouse Carriage Model Involves a Type 2 Immune Shift and T and  Cell Recruitment to the Gallbladder.</a></h2><p>Typhoid fever, caused primarily by  serovar Typhi ( Typhi), is a life-threatening systemic disease responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Three to 5% of individuals infected with  Typhi become chronic carriers due to bacterial persistence in the gallbladder. We have demonstrated that  forms biofilms on gallstones to establish gallbladder carriage. However, an in-depth molecular understanding of chronic carriage in the gallbladder, from the perspective of both the pathogen and host, is poorly defined. To examine the dynamics of the gallbladder in response to  infection, we performed transcriptional profiling in the mouse gallbladder at early (7 days) and chronic (21 days) time points. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed a shift from a Th1 proinflammatory response at 7 days postinfection (dpi) toward an anti-inflammatory Th2 response by 21 dpi, characterized by increased levels of immunoglobulins and the Th2 master transcriptional regulator, GATA3. Additionally, bioinformatic analysis predicted the upstream regulation of characteristic Th2 markers, including interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Stat6. Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis confirmed a significant increase in lymphocytes, including T and  cells, at 21 dpi in mice with gallstones. Interestingly, the levels of -specific CD4 T cells were 10-fold higher in the gallbladder of mice with gallstones at 21 dpi. We speculate that the biofilm state allows  to resist the initial onslaught of the Th1 inflammatory response, while yet undefined events influence a switch in the host  toward a more permissive type 2 response, enabling the establishment of chronic infection. The existence of chronic typhoid carriers has been in the public eye for over 100 years in part because of the publicity around Typhoid Mary. Additionally, it has been known for decades that the gallbladder is the main site of persistence and recently that gallstones play a key role. Despite this, very little is known about the physiological conditions that allow  serovar Typhi to persist in the gallbladder. In this study, we analyze the transcriptional profile of the gallbladder in a mouse model of chronic carriage. We found a shift from an early proinflammatory immune response toward a later anti-inflammatory response, which could explain the stalemate that allows  persistence. Interestingly, we found a 10-fold increase in the number of -specific T cells in mice with gallstones. This work moves us closer to understanding the mechanistic basis of chronic carriage, with a goal toward eradication of the disease.Copyright © 2019 González et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647019>Vaccination or mass drug administration against schistosomiasis: a hypothetical cost-effectiveness modelling comparison.</a></h2><p>Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease, targeted by the World Health Organization for reduction in morbidity by 2020. It is caused by parasitic flukes that spread through contamination of local water sources. Traditional control focuses on mass drug administration, which kills the majority of adult worms, targeted at school-aged children. However, these drugs do not confer long-term protection and there are concerns over the emergence of drug resistance. The development of a vaccine against schistosomiasis opens the potential for control methods that could generate long-lasting population-level  if they are cost-effective.Using an individual-based transmission model, matched to epidemiological data, we compared the cost-effectiveness of a range of vaccination programmes against mass drug administration, across three transmission settings. Health benefit was measured by calculating the heavy-intensity infection years averted by each intervention, while vaccine costs were assessed against robust estimates for the costs of mass drug administration obtained from data. We also calculated a critical vaccination cost, a cost beyond which vaccination might not be economically favorable, by benchmarking the cost-effectiveness of potential vaccines against the cost-effectiveness of mass drug administration, and examined the effect of different vaccine protection durations.We found that sufficiently low-priced vaccines can be more cost-effective than traditional drugs in high prevalence settings, and can lead to a greater reduction in morbidity over shorter time-scales. MDA or vaccination programmes that target the whole community generate the most health benefits, but are generally less cost-effective than those targeting children, due to lower prevalence of schistosomiasis in adults.The ultimate cost-effectiveness of vaccination will be highly dependent on multiple vaccine characteristics, such as the efficacy, cost, safety and duration of protection, as well as the subset of population targeted for vaccination. However, our results indicate that if a vaccine could be developed with reasonable characteristics and for a sufficiently low cost, then vaccination programmes can be a highly cost-effective method of controlling schistosomiasis in high-transmission areas. The population-level  generated by vaccination will also inevitably improve the chances of interrupting transmission of the disease, which is the long-term epidemiological goal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618247>Fine epitope mapping of glycoprotein Gn in Guertu virus.</a></h2><p>Guertu virus (GTV) is a tick-borne phleboviruses (TBPVs) which belongs to the genus Banyangvirus in the family of Phenuiviridae. In vitro and in vivo studies of GTV demonstrated that it was able to infect animal and human cell lines and could cause pathological lesions in mice. Glycoproteins (GP, including Gn and Gc) on the surface of Guertu virus (GTV) could bind to receptors on host cells and induce protective  in the host, but knowledge is now lacking on the information of  cell epitopes (BCEs) present on GTV-GP protein. The aim of this study was to identify all BCEs on Gn of the GTV DXM strain using rabbit pAbs against GTV-Gn. Seven fine BCEs and two antigenic peptides (APs) from nine reactive 16mer-peptides were identified, which are EGn1 (2PIICEGLTHS11), EGn2 (135CSQDSGT141), EGn3 (165IP EDVF170), EGn4 (169VFQEL K174), EGn5 (187IDGILFN193), EGn6 (223QTKWIQ228), EGn7 (237CHKDGIGPC245), AP-8 (299GVRVRPKCYGFSRMMA314) and AP-9 (355CASH FCSSAESGKKNT370), of which six of mapped BCEs were recognized by the IgG-positive sheep serum obtained from sheep GTV-infected naturally. Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) based on each mapped BCE motif identified that the most of identified BCEs and APs are highly conserved among 10 SFTSV strains from different countries and lineages that share relatively close evolutionary relationships with GTV. The fine epitope mapping of the GTV-Gn would provide basic data with which to explore the GTV-Gn antigen structure and pathogenic mechanisms, and it could lay the foundation for the design and development of a GTV multi-epitope peptide vaccine and detection antigen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567398>Clozapine-associated secondary antibody deficiency.</a></h2><p>Clozapine has recently been described as a novel cause of secondary antibody deficiency (SAD), associated with long-term therapy. Here we critically review the evidence linking clozapine use to an increased infection risk, describe immunological alterations, and discuss potential mechanisms.Individuals with schizophrenia are at two to five times more likely to develop pneumonia than the general population, in particular, when receiving clozapine. Delayed-onset distinguishes clozapine-associated hypogammaglobulinaemia from agranulocytosis or neutropenia that occur at lesser frequency. Biomarker searches in treatment-resistant schizophrenia highlight an immune signature associated with long-term clozapine use. This includes reduction in class-switched memory  cells, echoing common variable immunodeficiency. Recent identification of a role for dopamine in T follicular helper- cell interactions may inform future clinical studies.The detrimental impact of the increased infection risk associated with clozapine necessitates a re-evaluation of the current monitoring strategies as well as further studies to better understand the underlying mechanisms of SAD in this setting. On the basis of available evidence, we suggest simple modifications to clozapine monitoring including integration of routine vaccination, smoking cessation, and assessment of humoral . Further studies are required to understand the role of clozapine in neuroinflammation as well as other potentially autoantibody-mediated diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588407>Measuring alloreactive  cell responses in transplant recipients.</a></h2><p>Despite advanced immunosuppression, donor-specific antibodies (DSA) remain the leading cause of acute and chronic transplant tissue injury. Comprehensive evaluation of anti-donor humoral immune responses is critical for successful prevention, diagnosis and treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. This review summarizes the evolution of techniques used for this purpose in experimental and clinical transplantation.For decades, measuring DSA serum levels was the only way to assess recipient humoral . Recently, the interest shifted from quantifying circulating DSA to the analyses of various  cell subsets and most importantly, of donor antigen-specific  cells. State-of-the-art approaches have been developed by studies of model antigens, infectious agents and autoimmunity.

Here, it was demonstrated that the expression of NMBR in cells or murine lung tissues was clearly upregulated in response to H1N1/PR8 influenza A virus infection. Furthermore, the in vitro and in vivo activities of NMB/NMBR during PR8 infection were investigated. It was observed that A549 cells lacking endogenous NMBR were more susceptible to virus infection than control cells, as evidenced by the increased virus production in the cells. Interestingly, a significant decrease in IFN-α and increased IL-6 expression were observed in these cells. The role of this system in innate  against PR8 infection was probed by treating mice with NMB. The NMB-treated mice were less susceptible to virus challenge, as evidenced by increased survival, increased body weight, and decreased viral NP expression compared with the control animals. Additionally, the results showed that exogenous NMB not only enhanced IFN-α expression but also appeared to inhibit the expression of NP and IL-6 in PR8-infected cells and animals. As expected, opposing effects were observed in the NMBR antagonist-treated cells and mice, which further confirmed the effects of NMB. Together, these data suggest that NMB/NMBR may be an important component of the host defence against influenza A virus infection. Thus, these proteins may serve as promising candidates for the development of novel antiviral drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649546>Inflammation in Renal Diseases: New and Old Players.</a></h2><p>Inflammation, a process intimately linked to renal disease, can be defined as a complex network of interactions between renal parenchymal cells and resident immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, coupled with recruitment of circulating monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate  pathways such as nuclear factor ĸ (NF-ĸ) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut microbiota can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut microbiota and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut microbiota through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸ inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric acid production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605758>Candidate antigenic epitopes for vaccination and diagnosis strategies of Toxoplasma gondii infection: A review.</a></h2><p>Toxoplasmosis caused by an obligatory intracellular protozoan parasite of Toxoplasma gondii threats a wide spectrum of human and animal hosts. It has been shown that the intensity of the disease in humans depends on the host's immune responses. Immunological investigations on whole protein molecules of T. gondii have shown that these antigens are not fully responsible for the immune response, which leads to a decrease in specificity and affinity of the antigen (epitope)-antibody (paratope) binding. Currently, epitopes have shown promising entities to stimulate , T, cytotoxic T lymphocyte, and NK cells resulting in enhancement of protective  against toxoplasmosis patients. Thus, the accurate designing, prediction, and conducting of antigenic epitopes of T. gondii (with linear and/or spatial structures (can augment our understanding about development of new serological diagnostic kits and vaccines. The current review provides an update on the latest advances of current epitopes described against toxoplasmosis including  cell/T cell epitopes, antigen types, parasite strains, epitope sequences, assay settings (in vitro and/or in vivo), and target strategy.

Our aim is to quantify the association between the nose/throat microbiome and susceptibility to influenza virus infection.In this household transmission study, index cases with confirmed influenza virus infection and their household contacts were followed for 9-12 days to identify secondary influenza infections. Respiratory swabs were collected at enrollment to identify and quantify bacterial species via high- performance sequencing. Data were analyzed by an individual hazard-based transmission model that was adjusted for age, vaccination, and household size.We recruited 115 index cases with influenza A(H3N2) or  infection, and 436 household contacts. We estimated that a 10-fold increase in the abundance in Streptococcus spp. and Prevotella salivae was associated with 48% (95% CI: 9%, 69%) and 25% (95% CI: 0.5%, 42%) lower susceptibility to influenza A(H3N2) infection, respectively. By contrast, for influenza  infection, a 10-fold increase in the abundance in Streptococcus vestibularis and Prevotella spp. was associated with 63% (95% CI: 17%, 83%) lower and 83% (95% CI: 15%, 210%) higher susceptibility, respectively.Susceptibility to influenza infection is associated with the nose/throat microbiome at the time of exposure. The effects of oligotypes on susceptibility differ between influenza A(H3N2) and  viruses. Our results suggest that microbiome may be a useful predictor of susceptibility, with the implication that microbiome could be modulated to reduce influenza infection risk, should these associations be causal.© The Author(s) 2019.

In the ASD brain, inflammatory cytokine and transcript profiling show increased expression of genes encoding mediators of the innate immune response. We evaluated post-mortem brain tissue for adaptive immune cells and immune cell-mediated cytotoxic damage that could drive this innate immune response in the ASD brain.Standard neuropathology diagnostic methods including histology and immunohistochemistry were extended with automated image segmentation to quantify identified pathologic features in the postmortem brains.We report multifocal perivascular lymphocytic cuffs contain increased numbers of lymphocytes in ~65% of ASD compared to control brains in males and females, across all ages, in most brain regions, and in white and grey matter, and leptomeninges. CD3 T-lymphocytes predominate over CD20 -lymphocytes and CD8 over CD4 T-lymphocytes in ASD brains. Importantly, the perivascular cuff lymphocytes numbers correlate to the quantity of astrocyte-derived round membranous blebs. Membranous blebs form as a cytotoxic reaction to lymphocyte attack. Consistent with multifocal immune cell-mediated injury at perivascular CSF-brain barriers, a subset of white matter vessels have increased perivascular space (with jagged contours) and collagen in ASD compared to control brains.

The inclusion criterion was vaccine non-response (hepatitis  surface antibody [anti-HBs] titre <10 IU/L) after a primary series with three doses of one type of recombinant vaccine against hepatitis  virus (either HBVaxPro-10 or Engerix- at months 0, 1, and 6). Participants were individually randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to a vaccination series of repeated initial vaccination (HBVaxPro 10 μg or Engerix- 20 μg) as the control, or to Twinrix 20 μg, Fendrix 20 μg, or HBVaxPro 40 μg. We used a web-based randomisation programme, stratified by centre, with a block size of four. Participants and centres were unmasked to assignment after randomisation. Laboratory staff and investigators were masked to vaccine-group assignment. All revaccination schedules were identical, with intramuscular vaccinations at 0, 1, and 2 months. Anti-HBs was measured at 0, 1, 2, and 3 months. The primary outcome was the percentage of responders (anti-HBs titres ≥10 IU/L) at 3 months. Immunogenicity and safety analyses were based on an intention-to-vaccinate analysis, the immunogenicity analysis with last observation carried forward for missing data, and the Bonferroni and the Benjamini-Hochberg method were applied to correct for multiple testing. The trial was registered in the Dutch National Trial Register and inclusion has been stopped (identifier NL3011; EudraCT-number 2011-005627-40).The participants were recruited between Nov 1, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017. 480 participants were randomly assigned and included in intention-to-vaccinate analyses: 124 (26%) to control, 118 (25%) to Twinrix, 114 (24%) to HBVaxPro-40, and 124 (26%) to Fendrix. At month 3 the percentage of responders was 83 (67%) of 124 (95% CI 57·9-75·1 in the control group, 94 (80%) of the 118 (71·3-86·5) in the Twinrix group, 95 (83%) of 114 (75·2-89·7) in the HBVaxPro-40 group, and 108 (87%) of 124 (79·9-92·4) in the Fendrix group. Compared with the control group, the percentage of responders was superior for the HBVaxPro-40 group (adjusted difference 21·6% [95% CI 10·4-32·7], p=0·0204 [Bonferroni corrected p value]) and the Fendrix group (26·3% [15·4-37·3], p=0·0006), but not the Twinrix group (25·0% [13·0-37·0]; p=0·0846).

Recent studies collectively demonstrate that the suppressive activity of MDSCs is not limited to T cells, but rather affects a broad range of immune cell subsets. However, relatively few studies have assessed the impact of MDSCs on  cells, particularly in the human context. Here, we report that human monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) significantly interfere with human -cell proliferation and function in vitro. We further show that the inhibition occurs independent of direct cell-contact and involves the expression of suppressive mediators such as indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO), arginase-1 (Arg1), and nitric oxide (NO). In addition, our studies demonstrate that the suppression of  cells by M-MDSCs is paralleled by a skewing in -cell phenotype and gene expression signatures. M-MDSCs induced the downregulation of key surface markers on activated  cells, including IgM, HLA-DR, CD80, CD86, TACI, and CD95. Concurrently, M-MDSCs but not conventional monocytes elicited alterations in the transcription of genes involved in apoptosis induction, class-switch regulation, and -cell differentiation and function.

As global warming intensifies, sea cucumbers are increasingly exposed to adverse environmental conditions, which can cause severe economic losses and limit the sustainable development of sea cucumber aquaculture. It is therefore important to better understand how sea cucumbers respond to environmental stress, especially with regard to its effects on . In the present study, the time series of -related gene expression in sea cucumbers under thermal and hypoxic stresses were analyzed separately. The expression trends of 17 genes related to the nuclear factor κ (NF-κ) pathway, the protease family, the complement system, heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the transferrin family during exposure to two stresses at eight time points were concluded. These genes have interconnected roles in stress defense. The expression levels of genes relating to the NF-κ pathways and HSPs were strongly affected in the sea cucumber thermal stress response, while melanotransferrin (Mtf), ferritin (Ft) and mannan-binding C-type lectin (MBCL) were affected by hypoxia. In contrast, complement factor  (Bf), myosin V (Mys) and serine protease inhibitor (SPI) were not that sensitive during the initial period of environmental stress. Similar expression patterns under both thermal and hypoxic stress for certain genes, including an increase in Hsp90 and decreases in lysozyme (Lys), major yolk protein (MYP), cathepsin C (CTLC) and thymosin β (Thy) were observed in sea cucumbers. Conversely, NF-κ and Hsp70 were differentially affected by the two stress treatments. Lysozyme-induced immune defense was inconstant in sea cucumbers coping with stress. A gene ontology (GO) analysis of the selected genes revealed that the most co-involved terms related to  and iron ion. Our analysis suggests that sea cucumbers demonstrate complex and varied immune responses to different types of stresses.

AML with mutated NPM1 is recognised as a separate entity in the World Health Organisation 2016 classification, and carries a relatively favourable prognosis. NPM1 mutations are predominantly 4 bp duplications or insertions in the terminal exon that arise through an unknown mechanism. Here we analyse 2430 NPM1 mutations from 2329 adult and 101 pediatric patients to address their origin. We show that NPM1 mutations display the hallmarks of replication slippage, but lack suitable germline microhomology available for priming. Insertion mutations display G/C-rich N-nucleotide tracts, with a significant bias towards polypurine and polypyrimidine stacking (p < 0.001). These features suggest terminal deoxyucleotidyl transferase (TdT) primes replication slippage through N-nucleotide addition, with longer syntheses manifesting as N-regions. The recurrent Type A, Type D and Type  mutations require 1, 2 and 3 N-nucleotide extensions of T, CC and CAT respectively, with the last nucleotide used as occult microhomology. This TdT-mutator model successfully predicts the relative incidence of the 256 potential 4bp insertion/duplication mutations at position c.863_864 over four orders of magnitude (rho = 0.484, p < 0.0001). Children have a different NPM1 mutation spectrum to adults, including a shift away from Type A mutations and towards longer N-regions, consistent with higher TdT activity in pediatric myeloid stem cells.

The hazard ratio per 50% increase in admission levels of CXCL16 analyzed as continuous variable was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.44-1.88), <0.0001. This association remained statistically significant after adjustment for randomized treatment, clinical variables, CRP (C-reactive protein), leukocytes, cystatin C, NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide), troponin T, GDF-15 (growth differentiation factor 15), and other biomarkers; hazard ratio 1.23 (1.05-1.45), =0.0126. The admission level of CXCL16 was independently associated with cardiovascular death (1.50 [1.17-1.92], =0.0014) but not with ischemic events alone, in fully adjusted analyses. No statistically independent association was found between CXCL16 measured at 1 month, or change in CXCL16 from admission to 1 month, and clinical outcomes.In patients with acute coronary syndrome, admission level of CXCL16 is independently related to adverse clinical outcomes, mainly driven by an association to cardiovascular death. Thus, CXCL16 measurement may enhance risk stratification in patients with this condition.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

We hypothesized that restoration of T cell deficiency attenuates dermal scarring.  We assessed the temporal-spatial distribution of T lymphocytes and their subtypes during the physiological dermal wound repair process in mice. Also, we compared the scarring outcomes between wild-type (WT) and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, which are lymphocyte deficient. Complementary gain-of-function experiments were performed by adoptively transferring lymphocyte subsets to validate their contribution to tissue repair in wounded SCID mice.  CD4 T lymphocytes were present within dermal wounds of WT mice beginning on day 1 and remained through day 30. Wounds of SCID mice exhibited accelerated closure, increased inflammation, limited neovascularization, and exacerbated scarring compared with WT mice. Conversely, transfer of either mixed  and T lymphocytes or CD4 lymphocytes alone into SCID mice resulted in moderated healing with less inflammation, collagen deposition, and scarring than control SCID wounds. In contrast, transfer of other lymphocyte subsets, including helper T lymphocytes (CD3CD4CD25), CD8 T cells and  cells, or regulatory T lymphocytes (CD4CD25CD127), did not reduce scar.  The finding that lymphocytes delay wound healing but reduce scar is novel and provides new insights into how dermal scarring is regulated.  Our data support a suppressive role for CD4 T cells against inflammation and collagen deposition, with protective effects in early-stage dermal wound healing. These data implicate adaptive  in the regulation of scarring phenotypes.© Xinyi Wang et al., 2019; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563464>Germline-Encoded Affinity for Cognate Antigen Enables Vaccine Amplification of a Human Broadly Neutralizing Response against Influenza Virus.</a></h2><p>Antibody paratopes are formed by hypervariable complementarity-determining regions (CDRH3s) and variable gene-encoded CDRs. The latter show biased usage in human broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against both HIV and influenza virus, suggesting the existence of gene-endowed targeting solutions that may be amenable to pathway amplification. To test this, we generated transgenic mice with human CDRH3 diversity but simultaneously constrained to individual user-defined human immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain (V) genes, including IGHV1-69, which shows biased usage in human bnAbs targeting the hemagglutinin stalk of group 1 influenza A viruses. Sequential immunization with a stalk-only hemagglutinin nanoparticle elicited group 1 bnAbs, but only in IGHV1-69 mice. This V-endowed response required minimal affinity maturation, was elicited alongside pre-existing influenza , and when IGHV1-69  cells were diluted to match the frequency measured in humans. These results indicate that the human repertoire could, in principle, support germline-encoded bnAb elicitation using a single recombinant hemagglutinin immunogen.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The tumor-associated antigen L6 (TAL6) is overexpressed on the surface of different cancer cells and promotes cancer progression; therefore, it could be a potential target for cancer treatment. We have revealed that a synthetic peptide containing HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and  cell epitope can induce cellular and humoral  against TAL6-expressing cancer. To enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy, in this report, we designed an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting sequence (adenovirus E3/19K protein) at the N-terminus of TAL6 to facilitate MHC class I antigen presentation to CD8 T cells. Transfection of mammalian cells with the plasmid containing TAL6 fused with the ER-targeting sequence (pEKL6) resulted in higher levels of TAL6 antigens in the ER than transfection with the full-length TAL6 (pL6). The plasmid pEKL6 induced both TAL6-specific CTL responses and antibody titers after intramuscular (IM) immunization with electroporation and it elicited higher levels of antigen-specific CTLs in HLA-A2 transgenic mice. Immunization with pEKL6 induced higher levels of protective antitumor  against tumor growth than pL6 immunization in thymoma and melanoma tumor animal models. Notably, pEKL6 elicited long-term anti-tumor  against the recurrence of cancers. We found that CD4 T, CD8 T, and NK cells are all important for the effector mechanisms of pEKL6 immunization. Thus, cancer therapy using an ER-targeting sequence linked to a tumor antigen holds promise for treating tumors by triggering strong immune reactions.AJCR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612751>Analysis of the  effects after enhanced hepatitis  vaccination on patients with lymphoma.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the study was to evaluate the  effects after vaccinating different doses and frequencies of hepatitis  vaccines by calculating the seroconversion rates of HBsAb in patients with lymphoma. Clinical data of 315 patients from January 2010 to August 2018 were analyzed. According to different doses and frequencies, the patients were divided into three groups: low-dose group, high-dose group, and high-dose and high-frequency group. The highest seroconversion rate of HBsAb was 82.3% in the high-dose and high-frequency group ( < .05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the dose and frequency of vaccination ( < .001, OR = 2.663), sex ( < .006, OR = 3.106), the Ann Arbor stage ( < .001, OR = 0.195) and whether the chemotherapy regimen contained ibrutinib or not ( < .008, OR = 8.115) are independent factors affecting the  effects of hepatitis  vaccine in patients with lymphoma.

These range from microbial deposit and filter feeders, micro and macrophagous algal feeders, omnivores to herbivorous leaf litter and wood feeders. Endo-β-1,4-glucanase from glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GH9) digests cellulose like β-1,4-glucans from a range of materials. As it hydrolyses crystalline cellulose very slowly, it is a poor cellulase. Where tested, the enzyme has dual endo-β-1,4-glucanase and lichenase activity. Its presence does not necessarily indicate the ability of an animal to digest cellulose. It only indicates the ability to digest β-1,4-glucans and its function, which is discussed in this review, should be considered with reference to the substrates present in the diet. β-1,3-glucanase (laminarinase) belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 16 (GH16) and hydrolyses β-1.3-glucans. These polysaccharides are present in the cell walls of algae, protozoans and yeast, and they also occur as storage polysaccharides within protozoans and algae. Depending on their site of expression, these enzymes may function as a digestive enzyme or may be involved in innate . Enzymes present in the digestive fluids or tissues, would be digestive. Haemolymph GH16 proteins may be involved in innate  through the activation of the phenol oxidase system. Insect GH16 proteins expressed within the haemolymph have lost their catalytic residues and function as β-glucan binding proteins. In contrast, crustacean GH16 proteins expressed within the same tissue, have retained the catalytic residues and thus possibly their β-1,3-glucanase activity. The potential function of which is discussed. Endo-β-1,4-mannase from glycosyl hydrolase family 5, subfamily 10 (GH5_10) hydrolyses mannan, glucomannan and galactomannan. These hemicelluloses are present in the cell walls of plants and algae and also function as storage polysaccharides within legume and palm seeds. They are digestive enzymes whose high expression in some species suggests they are a major contributor to hemicellulose digestion. They may also provide the animal with substantial amounts of monosaccharides for energy.Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral  to the microbiota differ in health versus inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and -cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory -cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although -cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral  to the microbiota in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier  and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue , improve barrier function and prevent -cell dysfunction in microbiota-associated disease and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585898>Lonicerin prevents inflammation and apoptosis in LPS-induced acute lung injury.</a></h2><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening condition caused by severe inflammation of lung tissues.

The membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the HIV-1 gp41 fusion protein is targeted by the most broadly reactive HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. Here, we examine the structural and molecular mechansims of neutralization by anti-MPER bnAb, LN01, which was isolated from lymph-node-derived germinal center  cells of an elite controller and exhibits broad neutralization breadth. LN01 engages both MPER and the transmembrane (TM) region, which together form a continuous helix in complex with LN01. The tilted TM orientation allows LN01 to interact simultaneously with the peptidic component of the MPER epitope and membrane via two specific lipid binding sites of the antibody paratope. Although LN01 carries a high load of somatic mutations, most key residues interacting with the MPER epitope and lipids are germline encoded, lending support for the LN01 epitope as a candidate for lineage-based vaccine development.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

It is rare in non-immunosuppressed individuals, especially children. Little is known about host immune response and genetic susceptibility to this endemic fungus. Genetic defects in the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)/STAT1 signaling pathway, CD40/CD40 ligand- and IL12/IL12-receptor-mediated crosstalk between phagocytes and T-cells, and STAT3-mediated Th17 differentiation have been reported in HIV-negative children with talaromycosis and other endemic mycoses such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. There is a need to design a diagnostic algorithm to evaluate such patients. In this article, we review a cohort of pediatric patients with disseminated talaromycosis referred to the Asian Primary Immunodeficiency Network for genetic diagnosis of PID. Using these illustrative cases, we propose a diagnostics pipeline that begins with immunoglobulin pattern (IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE) and enumeration of lymphocyte subpopulations (T-, -, and NK-cells). The former could provide clues for hyper-IgM syndrome and hyper-IgE syndrome. Flow cytometric evaluation of CD40L expression should be performed for patients suspected to have X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome. Defects in interferon-mediated JAK-STAT signaling are evaluated by STAT1 phosphorylation studies by flow cytometry. STAT1 hyperphosphorylation in response to IFN-α or IFN-γ and delayed dephosphorylation is diagnostic for gain-of-function STAT1 disorder, while absent STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFN-γ but normal response to IFN-α is suggestive of IFN-γ receptor deficiency. This simple and rapid diagnostic algorithm will be useful in guiding genetic studies for patients with disseminated talaromycosis requiring immunological investigations.Copyright © 2019 Lee, Lao-araya, Yang, Chan, Ma, Pei, Kui, Mao, Yang, Zhao, Trakultivakorn and Lau.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632279>Synergistic Combination of Polymyxin  and Enrofloxacin Induced Metabolic Perturbations in Extensive Drug-Resistant .</a></h2><p>Polymyxins are used as a last-resort class of antibiotics against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative .

This study investigated the mechanism underlying the synergistic killing of polymyxin  and enrofloxacin against extensive drug-resistant (XDR) . An XDR isolate  12196 was treated with clinically relevant concentrations of polymyxin  (2 mg/L) and enrofloxacin (1 mg/L) alone or in combination.

Significantly perturbed metabolites ( < 0.05, fold change ≥ 2) were subjected to pathway analysis. The synergistic killing by polymyxin -enrofloxacin combination was initially driven by polymyxin  as indicated by the perturbation of lipid metabolites at 1 h in particular. The killing was subsequently driven by enrofloxacin  the inhibition of DNA replication, resulting in the accumulation of nucleotides at 4 h.

It contains six genes in the order of 3'-------5'. The sigma virus is the only arthropod-specific virus of the  family. Sigma-virus-infected  may suffer from irreversible paralysis when exposed to a high CO concentration, but generally, no other symptoms are reported. A recent study reported that host gene expression in immune pathways was not changed in sigma-virus-infected , which does not necessarily suggest that they are not involved in virus-host interactions. The present study aimed to identify host genes associated with sigma virus replication. Immune pathways JAK-STAT and IMD were selected for detailed study. The results showed that the genome copy number of the sigma virus increased after knocking down the immune pathway genes domeless and PGRP-LC in Drosophila S2 cells. The knocking down of domeless and PGRP-LC significantly up-regulated the expression of the L gene compared to the other viral genes. We propose that the immune pathways respond to sigma virus infection by altering L expression, hence suppressing viral replication. This effect was further tested in vivo, when D. melanogaster individuals injected with dsdome and dsPGRP-LC showed not only an increase in sigma virus copy number, but also a reduced survival rate when treated with CO. Our study proved that host  influences viral replication, even in persistent infection. Knocking down the key components of the immune process deactivates immune controls, thus facilitating viral expression and replication. We propose that the  system of D. melanogaster regulates the replication of the sigma virus by affecting the L gene expression. Studies have shown minimal host-virus interaction in persistent infection. However, our study demonstrated that the  continued to affect viral replication even in persistent infection because knocking down the key components of the immune process disabled the relevant immune controls and facilitated viral expression and replication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564454>Inhibition of Type III CRISPR-Cas  by an Archaeal Virus-Encoded Anti-CRISPR Protein.</a></h2><p>Bacteria and archaea possess a striking diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems divided into six types, posing a significant barrier to viral infection. As part of the virus-host arms race, viruses encode protein inhibitors of type I, II, and V CRISPR-Cas systems, but whether there are natural inhibitors of the other, mechanistically distinct CRISPR-Cas types is unknown. Here, we present the discovery of a type III CRISPR-Cas inhibitor, AcrIIIB1, encoded by the Sulfolobus virus SIRV2. AcrIIIB1 exclusively inhibits CRISPR-Cas subtype III-  mediated by the RNase activity of the accessory protein Csx1. AcrIIIB1 does not appear to bind Csx1 but, rather, interacts with two distinct subtype III- effector complexes-Cmr-α and Cmr-γ-which, in response to protospacer transcript binding, are known to synthesize cyclic oligoadenylates (cOAs) that activate the Csx1 "collateral" RNase. Taken together, we infer that AcrIIIB1 inhibits type III- CRISPR-Cas  by interfering with a Csx1 RNase-related process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are crucial for the rejection of established tumors. We constructed XCL1-GPC3 fusion molecules as a liver cancer vaccine by linking the XCL1 chemokine to glypican-3 (GPC3), which is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cells expressing XCL1-GPC3 chemoattracted murine XCR1+CD8α+DCs and human XCR1+CD141+DCs in vitro and promoted their IL-12 production. After subcutaneous mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid injection, mXCL1-GPC3 was mainly detected in CD8α+DCs of mouse draining lymph nodes. XCL1-GPC3-targeted DCs enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-proliferation and induced the de novo generation of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, which abolished GPC3-expressing tumor cells in mouse and human systems. We immunized a murine autochthonous liver cancer model, with a hepatitis  background, with the mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid starting six weeks, when malignant hepatocyte clusters formed, or 14 weeks, when liver tumor nodules developed, after diethylnitrosamine administration. mXcl1-GPC3 immunized mice displayed significantly inhibited tumor formation and growth compared to GPC3-immunized mice. After mXcl1-GPC3 immunization, mouse livers showed elevated production of IFNγ, granzyme , IL-18, CCL5, CXCL19, Xcl1, and increased infiltration of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, activated NK cells and NKT cells. The antitumor effects of these immune cells were further enhanced by the administration of anti-PD1. Anti-HCC effects induced by hXCL1-GPC3 were confirmed in HCC-PDX model from three patients.

Recent evidence suggests that IL-7 is a preferential homeostatic and survival factor for RORγt innate T cells such as natural killer T (NKT) cells, γδT cells, and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in the periphery. Given the important contribution of these populations in antibacterial  at barrier sites, we questioned whether IL-7 could be instrumental in boosting the local host immune response against respiratory bacterial infection. By using a cytokine-monoclonal antibody approach, we illustrated a role for topical IL-7 delivery in increasing the pool of RORγt IL-17A-producing innate T cells. Prophylactic IL-7 treatment prior to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection led to better bacterial containment, a process associated with increased neutrophilia and that depended on γδT cells and IL-17A. Last, combined delivery of IL-7 and α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), a potent agonist for invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, conferred an almost total protection in terms of survival, an effect associated with enhanced IL-17 production by innate T cells and neutrophilia.

To do so, developing  cells use combinatorial joining of V-, D-, and J-gene segments to generate an extraordinarily diverse repertoire of -cell antigen receptors (BCRs). Unsurprisingly, a large fraction of this initial BCR repertoire reacts to self-antigens, and these "forbidden"  cells are culled by immunological tolerance from mature -cell populations. While culling of autoreactive BCRs mitigates the risk of autoimmunity, it also opens gaps in the BCR repertoire, which are exploited by pathogens that mimic the forbidden self-epitopes. Consequently, immunological tolerance, necessary for averting autoimmune disease, also acts to limit effective microbial . In this brief review, we recount the evidence for the linkage of tolerance and impaired microbial , consider the implications of this linkage for vaccine development, and discuss modulating tolerance as a potential strategy for strengthening humoral immune responses.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Recent studies have implicated SAAs in innate  and various disorders, however the precise mechanism eludes us. Previous studies have shown SAAs are elevated following stroke and cerebral ischemiand our studies demonstrated that SAA deficient mice reduces inflammation and infarct volumes in a mouse stroke model. Our studies demonstrate SAA increases the cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is mediated by Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, cathepsin  and caspase-1 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. SAA induced the expression of NLRP3 which mediated IL-1β induction in murine BV-2 cells and both sex primary mouse microglial cells, in a dose and time dependent fashion. Inhibition or knockout of the NLRP3 in microglia prevented the increase in IL-1β. -acetyl--cysteine and mito-TEMPO blocked the induction of IL-1β by inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) with SAA treatment. In addition, inhibition of cathepsin  with different drugs or microglia from CatB deficient mice attenuated inflammasome activation. Our studies suggest that the impact of SAA on inflammasome stimulation is mediated in part by the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor proteins 2 and 4. SAA induced inflammatory cytokines and an M1 phenotype in the microglial cells, while downregulating anti-inflammation M2 phenotype. These studies suggest that brain injury to can elicit a systemic inflammatory response mediated through SAA that contributes to the pathological outcomes.In the present study, SAA can induce that activation of the inflammasome in microglial cells and give rise to IL-1β release which can further inflammation in the brain following neurological diseases.

Knockdown of receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase (RIPK) 1 leads to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. However, the involvement of RIPK1 in the pathogenesis of OA is unclear. Here, we evaluated the effect of RIPK1 on chondrocytes and elaborated the underlying molecular mechanism. Knockdown of RIPK1 protected chondrocytes against inflammation and apoptosis induced by interleukin (IL)-1β  and . RIPK1 was required for myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)- and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon  (TRIF)-mediated production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in OA. Moreover, overexpression of RIPK1 promoted the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), which blocked the expression and phosphorylation of RIPK1. Upregulation of TRAF2 decreased the expression of TRIF, MyD88, and MMPs in chondrocytes. Furthermore, knockdown of RIPK1 blocked activation of the nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. In summary, knockdown of RIPK1 alleviated OA in a manner mediated by the TRIF/MyD88-RIPK1-TRAF2 negative feedback loop and activation of the NF-κ and JNK signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583766>Up-regulation of miR-27a promotes monocyte-mediated inflammatory responses in Kawasaki disease by inhibiting function of B10 cells.</a></h2><p>Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis and activation of monocytes plays a central role in the pathogenesis of it. B10 cells, a  cell subset with negative regulatory properties, are functionally identified by their ability to express cytoplasmic IL-10 after ex vivo stimulation. Here, we aimed to explore the functional role of B10 cells during monocyte-mediated inflammatory responses in KD, as well as elucidate the underlying microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulatory mechanisms. Expression of IL-10 by each group of  cells (total  cells, transitional  cells, naïve  cells, and memory  cells) and inhibition of monocyte-derived TNF-α by activated  cells were measured by flow cytometry. Expression of miRNAs (miR-21-3p, miR-98-5p/3p, miR-27a-3p, let7b-5p, and miR-1423p/5p) that affect IL-10 levels in  cells was quantitated by real-time PCR. The relationship between IL-10 and these miRNAs was examined by multivariate analysis. MiR-mediated RNA interference in  cells was performed to investigate the role of miR-27a on expression of IL-10. The results showed expression of cytoplasmic IL-10 in  cell subsets from patients with KD was down-regulated. The inhibitory effect of B10 cells on production of TNF-α by monocytes from patients with KD was also compromised. The miR-27a-3p expression was markedly up-regulated during the acute phrase of KD, and it promoted monocyte-mediated TNF-α release by negatively regulating expression of cytoplasmic IL-10 within  cells in vitro. The data suggest up-regulated miR-27a in  cells from patients with KD may promote monocyte-mediated inflammatory responses by inhibiting the regulatory function of B10 cells.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620075>Peripheral Innate Immune Activation Correlates With Disease Severity in  Haploinsufficiency.</a></h2><p> To investigate associations between peripheral innate immune activation and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) in progranulin gene () haploinsufficiency.

Voxel based morphometry was used to model associations between marker levels and brain atrophy in mutation carriers relative to controls. Linear regression was used to model relationships between plasma marker levels with mean frontal white matter integrity [fractional anisotropy (FA)] and the FTLD modified Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes score (FTLD-CDR SB).  Plasma sCD163 was higher in symptomatic  carriers [mean 321 ng/ml (SD 125)] compared to controls [mean 248 ng/ml (SD 58);  < 0.05]. Plasma CCL18 was higher in symptomatic  carriers [mean 56.9 pg/ml (SD 19)] compared to controls [mean 40.5 pg/ml (SD 14);  < 0.05].

In this study, we cloned the Tβ12 gene with an ORF of 126 bp coding 41 amino acids from Urechis unicinctus. Tissue distribution analysis by qRT-PCR used TBP as reference gene showed that Tβ12 was widely expressed in all tissues, and the transcript levels were the highest in the body wall, followed by the coelomic fluid, and the lowest in the intestines and anal sacs. After LPS (lipopolysaccharides) injection, Tβ12 expression in the body was first elevated significantly at 3 h (p < 0.05), indicating that the body wall was the first defense line of the innate immune system; in the coelomic fluid, the Tβ12 mRNA levels increased after LPS injection, with a significant increase occurring at 6 h, showing that coelomic fluid functioned as the second defense line of the innate immune system. In the midgut and anal sacs, a significant increase in the Tβ12 level occurred at 24 h, suggesting that the midgut and anal sacs may act as accessory organs for the innate immune system. Moreover, U. unicinctus Tβ12 recombinants can effectively inhibit the growth of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

Herein we examine heterogeneity of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) repertoire. The number of TCR sequences selectively expanded in tumors varies within and between tumors and correlates with the number of nonsynonymous mutations. Expanded TCRs can be subdivided into TCRs found in all tumor regions (ubiquitous) and those present in a subset of regions (regional). The number of ubiquitous and regional TCRs correlates with the number of ubiquitous and regional nonsynonymous mutations, respectively. Expanded TCRs form part of clusters of TCRs of similar sequence, suggestive of a spatially constrained antigen-driven process. CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes harboring ubiquitous TCRs display a dysfunctional tissue-resident phenotype. Ubiquitous TCRs are preferentially detected in the blood at the time of tumor resection as compared to routine follow-up.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a class of unique liver stromal cells, participate in immunomodulatory activities by inducing the apoptosis of effector T-cells, generation of regulatory T-cells, and development of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to achieve long-term survival of islet allografts. This study provides in vitro and in vivo evidences that HSCs induce the generation of MDSCs to promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression through interleukin (IL)-6 secretion. HSC-induced MDSCs highly expressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase 1 mRNA and presented potent inhibitory T-cell immune responses in the tumor environment. Wild-type HSC-induced MDSCs expressed lower levels of CD40, CD86, and MHC II, and a higher level of B7-H1 surface molecules, as well as increased the production of iNOS and arginase I compared with MDSCs induced by IL-6-deficient HSCs in vitro. A murine-transplanted model of the liver tumor showed that HCCs cotransplanted with HSCs could significantly enhance the tumor area and detect more MDSCs compared with HCCs alone or HCCs cotransplanted with HSCs lacking IL-6. In conclusion, the results indicated that MDSCs are induced mainly by HSCs through IL-6 signaling and produce inhibitory enzymes to reduce T-cell  and then promote HCC progression within the tumor microenvironment. Therapies targeting the pathway involved in MDSC production or its immune-modulating pathways can serve as an alternative immunotherapy for HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659824>Proteomics Profiling of Swine Serum Following Lipopolysaccharide Stimulation.</a></h2><p>There are no approved animal drugs for management of inflammation in swine due to lack of validated animal models.

These -cell responses show large variability between diseases, both in terms of the secreted autoantibody repertoire and the dynamics and characteristics of the underlying -cell responses. Hence, different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the emergence of autoreactive  cells in an otherwise self-tolerant immune system. Notably, most mechanistic insights have been obtained from murine studies using models harboring genetic modifications of  and T cells. Given recent technological advances that have rendered autoreactive human  cells accessible for analysis, we here discuss the phenomenon of extensive -glycosylation of the -cell receptor (BCR) variable domain of a prototypic human autoreactive -cell response and its potential role in the generation of autoimmunity. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) hallmark the most disease-specific autoimmune response in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Remarkably, ACPA-IgG are heavily -glycosylated in the variable domain due to somatic mutations that generate abundant -glycosylation consensus sequences. These sites, obtained from full-length BCR sequences of ACPA-expressing  cells from 12 ACPA-positive RA patients, were here analyzed in detail. Sites that required a single nucleotide mutation to be generated were defined as single somatic hypermutation (s-SHM) sites, whereas sites requiring multiple mutations were defined as m-SHM sites. IgG sequences of 12 healthy donors were used as control. Computational modeling of the germinal center reaction (CLONE algorithm) was used with the germline counterparts of ACPA-IgG heavy chain (HC) sequences to simulate the germinal center response. Our analyses revealed an abundance of -glycosylation sites in ACPA-IgG HC that frequently required multiple mutations and predominated in specific positions. Based on these data, and taking into account recent insights into the dynamics of the ACPA-response during disease development, we here discuss the hypothesis that -glycosylation sites in ACPA-IgG variable domains could lead to alternative, possibly antibody affinity-independent selection forces. Presumably, this occurs during germinal center responses allowing these  cells to escape from putative tolerance checkpoints, thereby driving autoreactive  cell development in the pathogenesis of RA.Copyright © 2019 Vergroesen, Slot, van Schaik, Koning, Rispens, van Kampen, Toes and Scherer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661607>Investigation of the molecular epizootiological characteristics and tracking of the geographical origins of Brucella canis strains in China.</a></h2><p>Brucellosis is a global pandemic infectious zoonosis.

Recombinant HlSerpin-a and HlSerpin- displayed protease inhibitory activities against multiple mammalian proteases. Similar to other tick serpins, HlSerpin-a and HlSerpin- suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL6 and IL-1β from LPS stimulated mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). The minimum active region (Reaction Centre Loop) of HlSerpin-a, named SA-RCL, showed similar biological activities as HlSerpin-a in the protease inhibition and immune suppression assays. The immunosuppressive activities of full length HlSerpin-a and SA-RCL are impaired in Cathepsin G or Cathepsin  knockout mouse macrophages, suggesting that the immunomodulation function of SA and SA-RCL are dependent on their protease inhibitory activity.

As expected, MIP therapy led to significant tumor regression in wild-type mice. However, antitumor efficacy of MIP was lost in MyD88 animals. Both PBS-treated (control) and MIP-treated MyD88 mice developed tumors with comparable volume. Since MyD88 relays TLR engagement signals, we analyzed the antitumor efficacy of MIP in TLR2 and TLR4 mice. It was observed that MIP therapy reduced tumor burden in wild-type and TLR4 mice but not in TLR2 mice. Tumor volume in MIP-treated TLR2 mice were comparable with those in PBS-treated wild-type animals.

This position paper therefore also investigates perspectives on how the advent of 'big data' and the use of animal models could help unravel inter-individual responses to exercise parameters and thus influence hypothesis-building for translational research in exercise-based cardiovascular rehabilitation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587259>High-throughput sequencing of T-cell receptor alpha chain clonal rearrangements at the DNA level in lymphoid malignancies.</a></h2><p>Rearrangements of T- and -cell receptor (TCR and BCR) genes are useful markers for clonality assessment as well as for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring during the treatment of haematological malignancies. Currently, rearrangements of three out of four TCR and all BCR loci are used for this purpose. The fourth TCR gene, TRA, has not been used so far due to the lack of a method for its rearrangement detection in genomic DNA. Here we propose the first high-throughput sequencing based method for the identification of clonal TRA gene rearrangements at the DNA level. The method is based on target amplification of the rearranged TRA locus using an advanced multiplex polymerase chain reaction system and high-throughput sequencing, and has been tested on DNA samples from peripheral blood of healthy donors. Combinations of all functional V- and J-segments were detected, indicating the high sensitivity of the method. Additionally, we identified clonal TRA rearrangements in 57 out of 112 tested DNA samples of patients with various T-lineage lymphoproliferative disorders. The method fills the existing gap in utilizing the TRA gene for a wide range of studies, including clonality assessment, MRD monitoring and clonal evolution analysis in different lymphoid malignancies.© 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635335>Effect of Peptides from Alaska Pollock on Intestinal Mucosal  Function and Purification of Active Fragments.</a></h2><p>The intestinal mucosal barrier plays an important role in systemic immune functions. This study aimed to find the mechanism of peptide from Alaska Pollock (APP) on intestinal mucosal  in mice induced by cyclophosphamide (Cy). Cy-induced decreases of body weight and index of immune organ were significantly improved by APP as compared with Cy group ( < 0.05). APP could promote the secretion of SIgA and IgA on intestinal mucosa ( < 0.05) and mainly had an impact on the final differentiation of IgA  cell, thereby promoting the secretion of plasma cells, which can be corroborated by the increases of IL-6 and IL-10 ( < 0.05). APP with high immune activity was separated and two peptides were purified and identified as Gly-Val-Ile-Lys and Ala-Cys-Asn-Gly-Arg. Therefore, APP can be considered as beneficial ingredients to protect the intestinal barrier disruption induced by Cy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583229>Effects of supplementation of  spp. on blood metabolites, antioxidant status, and gene expression pattern of selective cytokines in growing Barki lambs.</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated the potential immune-enhancing effects in addition to anti-oxidative stress properties of commercially accessible  supplementation in Barki lambs.Twenty apparently healthy weaned Barki lambs were used in this study and distributed randomly into two experimental groups: Negative control group, received control basal diet without any feed supplements and a supplemented group, received control basal diet supplemented with water added to commercially accessible bacilli at 1 gm/l/day for 30 consecutive days.

Despite this, the full range of mediators that inhibit T-cell activation and influence anti-tumor  is unclear. Here, we identify the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) Rasal1 as a novel TCR-ZAP-70 binding protein that negatively regulates T-cell activation and tumor . Rasal1 inhibits via two pathways, the binding and inhibition of the kinase domain of ZAP-70, and GAP inhibition of the p21-ERK pathway. It is expressed in activated CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells, and inhibits CD4 + T-cell responses to antigenic peptides presented by dendritic cells as well as CD4 + T-cell responses to peptide antigens in vivo. Furthermore, siRNA reduction of Rasal1 expression in T-cells shrinks B16 melanoma and EL-4 lymphoma tumors, concurrent with an increase in CD8 + tumor-infiltrating T-cells expressing granzyme  and interferon γ-1.

Lymphocyte counts recover shortly after the disappearance of measles-associated rash, but immunosuppression can persist for months to years after infection, resulting in increased incidence of secondary infections. Animal models and in vitro studies have proposed various immunological factors underlying this prolonged immune impairment, but the precise mechanisms operating in humans are unknown. Using  cell receptor (BCR) sequencing of human peripheral blood lymphocytes before and after MeV infection, we identified two immunological consequences from measles underlying immunosuppression: (i) incomplete reconstitution of the naïve  cell pool leading to immunological immaturity and (ii) compromised immune memory to previously encountered pathogens due to depletion of previously expanded  memory clones. Using a surrogate model of measles in ferrets, we investigated the clinical consequences of morbillivirus infection and demonstrated a depletion of vaccine-acquired  to influenza virus, leading to a compromised immune recall response and increased disease severity after secondary influenza virus challenge. Our results show that MeV infection causes changes in naïve and memory  lymphocyte diversity that persist after the resolution of clinical disease and thus contribute to compromised  to previous infections or vaccinations. This work highlights the importance of MeV vaccination not only for the control of measles but also for the maintenance of herd  to other pathogens, which can be compromised after MeV infection.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

During antigenic evolution, clade 2.3.2.1a and c A(H5N1) viruses acquired both S144N and V223I mutations around the receptor binding site of hemagglutinin (HA), with S144N generating an -glycosylation sequon. We introduced single or combined reverse mutations, N144S and/or I223V, into the HA gene of the clade 2.3.2.1c A(H5N1) virus and generated PR8-derived, 2 + 6 recombinant A(H5N1) viruses. When we compared replication efficiency in embryonated chicken eggs, mammalian cells, and mice, the recombinant virus containing both N144S and I223V mutations showed increased replication efficiency in avian and mammalian hosts and pathogenicity in mice. The N144S mutation significantly decreased avian receptor affinity and egg white inhibition, but not all mutations increased mammalian receptor affinity. Interestingly, the combined reverse mutations dramatically increased the thermostability of HA. Therefore, the adaptive mutations possibly acquired to evade avian  may decrease viral thermostability as well as mammalian pathogenicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632103>Meningococcal Group  Vaccine For The Prevention Of Invasive Meningococcal Disease Caused By  Serogroup .</a></h2><p>Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a major public health concern because of its high case fatality, long-term morbidity, and potential to course with outbreaks. IMD caused by Nesseira meningitidis serogroup  has been predominant in different regions of the world like Europe and only recently broadly protective vaccines against  serogroup have become available. Two protein-based vaccines, namely 4CMenB (Bexsero) and rLP2086 (Trumenba) are currently licensed for use in different countries against MenB disease. These vaccines came from a novel technology on vaccine design (or antigen selection) using highly specific antigen targets identified through whole-genome sequence analysis. Moreover, it has the potential to confer protection against non- meningococcus and against other Neisserial species such as gonococcus. Real-world data on the vaccine-use are rapidly accumulating from the UK and other countries which used the vaccine for control of outbreak or as part of routine immunization program, reiterating its safety and efficacy. Additional data on real-life effectiveness, long-term , and eventual herd effects, including estimates on vaccine impact for cost-effectiveness assessment are further needed. Given the predominance of MenB in Europe and other parts of the world, these new vaccines are crucial for the prevention and public health control of the disease, and should be considered.© 2019 Rivero-Calle et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562203>Targeting EZH2 enhances antigen presentation, antitumor  and circumvents anti-PD-1 resistance in head and neck cancers.</a></h2><p>Anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor-based therapeutics improve survival in recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients but many do not benefit due to a low response rate. Herein, we identified EZH2 as a therapeutic target that enhanced tumor cell antigen presentation and subsequently sensitized resistant tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy.EZH2 regulation of antigen presentation was defined using EZH2 inhibitors (GSK126 and EPZ6438) in human and mouse HNSCC cell lines. Mechanistic dissection of EZH2 in regulation of antigen presentation was investigated using flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, ELISA and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays. EZH2 deficient cell lines were generated using CRISPR-CAS9. GSK126 and anti-PD-1 blocking antibody were used in testing combinatorial therapy in vivo.EZH2 expression was negatively correlated with antigen processing machinery (APM) pathway components in HNSCC TCGA datasets. EZH2 inhibition resulted in significant upregulation of MHC Class I expression in human and mouse human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCC lines in vitro and in mouse models in vivo. Enhanced antigen presentation on the tumor cells by EZH2 inhibitors or CRISPR mediated EZH2 deficiency, increased antigen specific CD8+ T cell proliferation, IFNg production and tumor cell cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, EZH2 inhibition reduced the histone H3K27me3 modification on the -2-microglobulin (B2M) promoter. Finally, in an anti-PD-1 resistant model of HNSCC, tumor growth was suppressed with combination therapy.Our results demonstrated that targeting EZH2 enhanced antigen presentation and was able to circumvent anti-PD-1 resistance. Thus, combining EZH2 targeting with anti-PD-1 may increase therapeutic susceptibility in HNSCC.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603862>Identification and characterization of novel short-type BmPGRP-S4 from the silkworm, Bombyx mori, involved in innate .</a></h2><p>Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are pattern recognition receptors that can recognize bacterial peptidoglycans and trigger the innate immune response of insects. Here, we identified and characterized a novel short-type Bombyx mori peptidoglycan recognition proteins short-4 (BmPGRP-S4) in a lepidopteran insect, Bombyx mori. BmPGRP-S4 exhibited a cDNA sequence length of 600 bp, encoding 199 aa with a protein molecular weight of 22 kDa. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that BmPGRP-S4 contains a conserved PGRP domain. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that BmPGRP-S4 is highly expressed in the early developmental stages of silkworm larvae and presents tissue-specific expression in hemocytes. Interestingly, BmPGRP-S4 expression is significantly induced by bacterial infection in the midgut, fat body, and hemocytes. Furthermore, a dual luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that BmPGRP-S4 can activate the expression of the antimicrobial peptide genes lebocin, moricin, cecropin D, cecropin , and attacin. Taken together, these results suggest that BmPGRP-S4 plays an important role in the innate immune response of silkworms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664609>Molecular Heterogeneity of Papillary Thyroid Cancer: Comparison of Primary Tumors and Synchronous Metastases in Regional Lymph Nodes by Mass Spectrometry Imaging.</a></h2><p>Intra-tumor heterogeneity results from both genetic heterogeneity of cancer (sub)clones and phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells that could be induced by different local microenvironments. Here, we used mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to compare molecular profiles of primary tumors located in the thyroid gland and their synchronous metastases in regional lymph nodes to analyze phenotypic heterogeneity in papillary thyroid cancer. Two types of cancerous (primary tumor and metastasis) and two types of not cancerous (thyroid gland and lymph node) regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated in postoperative material from 11 patients, then the distribution of tryptic peptides (spectral components) was analyzed by MSI in all tissue regions. Moreover, tryptic peptides identified by shotgun proteomics in corresponding tissue lysates were matched to components detected by MSI to enable their hypothetical protein annotation. Unsupervised segmentation of all cancer ROIs revealed that different clusters dominated in tumor ROIs and metastasis ROIs. The intra-patient similarity between thyroid and tumor ROIs was higher than the intra-patient similarity between tumor and metastasis ROIs. Moreover, the similarity between tumor and its metastasis from the same patients was lower than similarities among tumors and among metastases from different patients (inter-patient similarity was higher for metastasis ROIs than for tumor ROIs). Components differentiating between tumor and its metastases were annotated as proteins involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton and chromatin, as well as proteins involved in -related functions. We concluded that phenotypical heterogeneity between primary tumor and lymph node metastases from the same patient was higher than inter-tumor heterogeneity between primary tumors from different patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656683>Next-generation care pathways for allergic rhinitis and asthma multimorbidity: a model for multimorbid non-communicable diseases-Meeting Report (Part 2).</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597715>Anti-donor MHC Class II Alloantibody Induces Glomerular Injury in Mouse Renal Allografts Subjected to Prolonged Cold Ischemia.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms underlying the effects of prolonged cold-ischemia storage on kidney allografts are poorly understood.To investigate effects of cold ischemia on donor-reactive immune responses and graft pathology, we used a mouse kidney transplantation model that subjected MHC-mismatched BALB/c kidney allografts to cold-ischemia storage for 0.5 or 6 hours before transplant into C57BL/6 mice.At day 14 post-transplant, recipients of allografts subjected to 6 versus 0.5 hours of cold-ischemia storage had increased levels of anti-MHC class II (but not class I) donor-specific antibodies, increased donor-reactive T cells, and a significantly higher proportion of transplant glomeruli infiltrated with macrophages. By day 60 post-transplant, allografts with a 6 hour cold-ischemia time developed extensive glomerular injury compared with moderate pathology in allografts with 0.5 hour of cold-ischemia time. Pathology was associated with increased serum levels of anti-class 2 but not anti-class 1 donor-specific antibodies. Recipient  cell depletion abrogated early macrophage recruitment, suggesting augmented donor-specific antibodies, rather than T cells, increase glomerular pathology after prolonged cold ischemia. Lymphocyte sequestration with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 antagonist FTY720 specifically inhibited anti-MHC class II antibody production and abrogated macrophage infiltration into glomeruli. Adoptive transfer of sera containing anti-donor MHC class II antibodies or mAbs against donor MHC class II restored early glomerular macrophage infiltration in FTY720-treated recipients.Post-transplant inflammation augments generation of donor-specific antibodies against MHC class II antigens. Resulting MHC class II-reactive donor-specific antibodies are essential mediators of kidney allograft glomerular injury caused by prolonged cold ischemia.Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664180>Allogeneic dendritic cells induce potent antitumor  by activating KLRG1CD8 T cells.</a></h2><p>The graft-versus-leukemia effect reminds us to observe the allogeneic cell elicited anti-tumor immune responses. Here we immunized recipient B6 mice with different types of allogenic leukocytes and found that vaccination with allogenic dendritic cells (alloDC) elicited the most efficient protection against broad-spectrum tumors. The recipient lymphocytes were analyzed and the data showed that CD8 T cells increased significantly after immunization and expressed effector memory T cell marker KLRG1. Functional evaluation demonstrated that these KLRG1CD8 T cells could kill tumor cells in vitro and in vivo in Granzyme - and Fas/FasL-dependent manners with no tumor antigen specificity, and tend to migrate into tumor sites by high expression of heparanase. Adoptive transfer of these cells could provide antitumor protection against tumors. AlloDC could also treat mice with residual tumors and combination of anti-PD1 antibody could enhance this effects. Together, our study showed that alloDC-immunization could induce potent antitumor effect through the expansion of KLRG1CD8 T cells, which can work as both preventive and therapeutic tumor vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637902>Influenza a virus and  coinfection potentially promotes bacterial colonization and enhances  lymphocyte depression and reduction.</a></h2><p>Influenza has frequently been epidemic in recent years. However, the mechanisms of severe pneumonia with postinfluenza Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) secondary infection have not been fully understood. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of pneumonia in postinfluenza A virus (IAV) infection via a mouse model. Mice were intranasally inoculated with SP three days after IAV inoculation. We then collected samples at three time points to dynamically observe the pathological progression. In IAV infection alone, lymphocyte infiltration and widened alveolar intervals were observed. In the blood, levels of the CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+ lymphocyte subpopulations were reduced, and IFN-γ and IL-10 were elevated. Slight atrophy was seen in the spleen, which was due to splenic  lymphocyteinitiated apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. When SP infection occurred after IAV infection, the pulmonary inflammation was significantly aggravated; a fair number of lymphocytes and neutrophils infiltrated simultaneously with exfoliated bronchial epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, widened alveolar septum and hemorrhaging. Increasing edema fluid and bacteria accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Decreased CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+ lymphocyte subpopulations and increased interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or interleukin 10 (IL-10) were more prominent compared to those with viral infection alone. Spleen atrophy resulting from coinfection was more obvious because of massive splenic  lymphocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway compared to viral infection alone. This study shows that although inflammation caused by SP infection alone was temporary, preceding IAV infection provided favorable conditions for SP colonization and multiplication by destroying lung structure and suppressing humoral . Synergistic IAV-SP coinfection is likely to facilitate more SP colonization and promote  lymphocyte-suppression and reduction.

However, adaptive cells utilize innate cell features to modulate their responses, and this area of T and -cell biology is understudied. This review will highlight recent work done to understand how innate features of adaptive immune cells modulate alloimmunity.Over the past year, research has shown that T-cell-expressed danger-associated molecular patterns, Toll-like receptors, complement receptors, and Fc receptors regulate T-cell alloimmunity in a cell-intrinsic manner. Further, IL-17 and p40 of IL-12 have been implicated in the migration of T cells into allografts.

A Th2 polarization has been associated with the infection, but there are still details of the cellular and humoral immune response that need to be described. Thus, the aim of this study was to describe the systemic host immune response to T canis chronic infection in a mouse model.BALB/c mice were inoculated once with 500 T canis embryonated eggs, per os. After 49 days, the amounts of larval found in brain and muscle tissues were statistically two and four times higher, respectively, than the amounts found in lung, liver, kidney or heart tissues. Splenic proportions of F4/80 cells, as well as , cytotoxic T and CD4 Foxp3 lymphocytes, were statistically higher (P ≤ .05, P ≤ .01, P ≤ .001 and P ≤ .001, respectively) as compared with control mice. In lymph nodes, some of these proportions changed, with the exception of F4/80 cells. IgG1 levels in infected mice sera were increased. IL-4, IL-10 and VEGF levels were statistically higher in spleen (P ≤ .05, all) and sera (P ≤ .01, P ≤ .05 and P ≤ .05, respectively) in the infected mice.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host  and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root microbiota, including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root . Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A mixed meal tolerance test was administered to each of the subjects 12 months after diagnosis, and the C-peptide area under the curve (AUC) was noted and was then tested for association with all immunological parameters.A gradual decrease in leukocytes (adjusted p = 0.0012) was reflected in a significant decrease in neutrophils (adjusted p = 0.0061) over the post-onset period, whereas Tregs (adjusted p = 0.0205) and originally low pDCs (adjusted p < 0.0001) increased.

The diverse repertoire of antibodies produced by V(D)J recombination inevitably includes autoantibodies that bind to self-antigens, estimated to be as much as 70% of nascent antibodies on immature  cells. Early theoretical models of tolerance hypothesized that such self-reactive clones could not possibly be allowed to survive and mature. However from the first direct view of the fate of nascent  cells carrying a self-binding antibody it was clear that many "forbidden clones" circulate to secondary lymphoid tissues, where they adopt an IgM IgD+ cell surface phenotype and are prevented from secreting autoantibodies by a series of tolerance checkpoints referred to as "clonal anergy." Since anergic  cells can be reactivated to secrete pathogenic autoantibodies in certain settings, the advantage of controlling self-reactive antibodies by clonal anergy has until recently remained enigmatic. Here we review this topic and recent advances showing that anergic  cells are recruited into the germinal center to mutate away from self-reactivity, undergoing "clonal redemption" into cells making antibodies with exquisite specificity for foreign immunogens.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Nonetheless, vaccination efficacy is very much reduced in aged population and against highly mutagenic viruses. Therefore, it is key to understand how  cell selection takes place in GC in order to develop new and fully protective vaccines. The cellular mechanisms that control selection of GC  cells are performed by different T cell populations. On one side, cognate entanglement of  cells with T follicular helper (Tfh) cells through cytokines and co-stimulatory signals promotes survival, proliferation, mutagenesis and terminal differentiation of GC  cells. On the other hand, regulatory T cells have also been reported within GC and interfere with T cell help for antibody production. These cells have been classified as a distinct T cell sub-population called T Follicular regulatory cells (Tfr). In this review, we investigate the phenotype, function and differentiation of these two cell populations.

We hypothesised that TLR signalling may be abnormal in children with DS and contribute to their clinical phenotype. We evaluated TLR pathways in 3 ways: determining the expression of TLR2 on the surface of neutrophils and monocytes by flow cytometry, examining the gene expression of key regulatory proteins involved in TLR signal propagation, MyD88, IRAK4, and TRIF, by quantitative PCR, and lastly determining the cytokine production by ELISA following immunomodulation with proinflammatory stimuli (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Pam3Csk4) and the anti-inflammatory agent SsnB. We report TLR2 expression being significantly increased on neutrophils, total monocytes, and intermediate and nonclassical monocytes in children with DS ( = 20, mean age 8.8 ± SD 5.3 years, female  = 11) compared to controls ( = 15, mean age 6.2 ± 4.2 years, female  = 5). At baseline, the expression of MyD88 was significantly lower, and TRIF significantly raised in children with DS. The TLR antagonist SsnB was effective in reducing TLR2 and CD11b expression and abrogating cytokine production in both cohorts. We conclude that TLR signalling and the TLR2 pathway are dysregulated in DS, and this disparate innate  may contribute to chronic inflammation in DS. SsnB attenuates proinflammatory mediators and may be of therapeutic benefit.Copyright © 2019 Dean Huggard et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665076>Intratumoral immunoglobulin isotypes predict survival in lung adenocarcinoma subtypes.</a></h2><p>The role of tumor-infiltrating -cells (TIBs) and intratumorally-produced antibodies in cancer- interactions essentially remains terra incognita. In particular, it remains unexplored how driver mutations could be associated with distinct TIBs signatures and their role in tumor microenvironment.Here we analyzed associations of immunoglobulin isotypes and clonality with survival in TCGA RNA-Seq data for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), stratifying patients into 12 driver mutation and phenotypic tumor subgroups.We revealed several unexpected associations between TIBs behavior and prognosis. Abundance and high proportion of IgG1 isotype, and low proportion of IgA among all intratumorally produced immunoglobulins were specifically associated with improved overall survival for KRAS but not KRAS LUAD, revealing the first link between a driver mutation and -cell response. We found specific IgG1 signature associated with long survival, which suggests that particular specificities of IgG1+ TIBs could be beneficial in KRAS LUAD. In contrast to our previous observations for melanoma, highly clonal IgG1 production by plasma cells had no meaningful effect on prognosis, suggesting that IgG1+ TIBs may exert a beneficial effect in KRAS cases in an alternative way, such as efficient presentation of cognate antigens or direct  cell attack on tumor cells. Notably, a high proportion of the IgG1 isotype is positively correlated with the non-silent mutation burden both in the general LUAD cohort and in most patient subgroups, supporting a role for IgG1 TIBs in antigen presentation. Complementing the recent finding that the presence of stromal IgG4-producing cells is associated with a favorable prognosis for patients with stage I squamous cell carcinoma, we show that the abundance of IgG4-producing TIBs likewise has a strong positive effect on overall survival in STK11 and proximal proliferative subgroups of LUAD patients. We hypothesize that the positive role of IgG4 antibodies in some of the lung cancer subtypes could be associated with reported inability of IgG4 isotype to form immune complexes, thus preventing immunosuppression via activation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) phenotype.We discover prominent and distinct associations between TIBs antibody isotypes and survival in lung adenocarcinoma carrying specific driver mutations. These findings indicate that particular types of tumor- relations could be beneficial in particular driver mutation context, which should be taken into account in developing strategies of cancer immunotherapy and combination therapies. Specificity of protective  cell populations in specific cancer subgroups could become a clue to efficient targeted immunotherapies for appropriate cohorts of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614857>Mechanical Ventilation Impairs IL-17 Cytokine Family Expression in Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia.</a></h2><p>Mechanical ventilation (MV) is the primary risk factor for the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Besides inducing a pro-inflammatory T-helper (Th)-1 cytokine response, MV also induces an anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokine response, marked by increased IL-4 secretion and reduced bacterial phagocytic capacity of rodent lung macrophages. Since IL-4 is known to downregulate both Th1 and Th17 cytokines, the latter is important in mediating mucosal  and combating bacterial and fungal growth, we studied and showed here in a rat model of MV that Th17 cytokines (IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22) were significantly upregulated in the lung as a response to different MV strategies currently utilized in clinic. To study whether the increased IL-4 levels are associated with downregulation of the anti-bacterial Th17 cytokines, we subsequently challenged mechanically ventilated rats with an intratracheal inoculation of   (VAP model) and showed a dramatic downregulation of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, compared to animals receiving the same bacterial burden without MV. For the studied Th1 cytokines (IFN, TNF, IL-6, and IL-1), only IFN showed a significant decrease as a consequence of bacterial infection in mechanically ventilated rats. We further studied IL-17A, the most studied IL-17 family member, in intensive care unit (ICU) pneumonia patients and showed that VAP patients had significantly lower levels of IL-17A in the endotracheal aspirate compared to patients entering ICU with pre-existing pneumonia. These translational data, obtained both in animal models and in humans, suggest that a deficient anti-bacterial Th17 response in the lung during MV is associated with VAP development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608073>Toward a Functional Cure for Hepatitis : The Rationale and Challenges for Therapeutic Targeting of the  Cell Immune Response.</a></h2><p>The central role of the cellular immune response in the control and clearance of the hepatitis  virus (HBV) infection has been well-established. The contribution of humoral , including  cell and antibody responses against HBV, has been investigated for a long time but has attracted increasing attention again in recent years. The anti-HBs antibody was first recognized as a marker of protective  after the acute resolution of the HBV infection (or vaccination) and is now defined as a biomarker for the functional cure of chronic hepatitis  (CHB). In this way, therapies targeting HBV-specific  cells and the induction of an anti-HBs antibody response are essential elements of a rational strategy to terminate chronic HBV infection. However, a high load of HBsAg in the blood, which has been proposed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance, represents a major obstacle to curing CHB. Long-term antiviral treatment by nucleoside analogs, by targeting viral translation by siRNA, by inhibiting HBsAg release via nucleic acid polymers, or by neutralizing HBsAg via specific antibodies could potentially reduce the HBsAg load in CHB patients. A combined strategy including a reduction of the HBsAg load via the above treatments and the therapeutic targeting of  cells by vaccination may induce the appearance of anti-HBs antibodies and lead to a functional cure of CHB.Copyright © 2019 Ma, Zhang, Gao, Xiong and Lu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608071>Human Monoclonal Antibodies as Adjuvant Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis  Virus Infection.</a></h2><p>Despite the availability of an effective prophylactic vaccine leading to sterilizing , hepatitis  virus (HBV) is responsible for chronic liver disease in more than 250 million individuals, potentially leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Antiviral drugs able to completely suppress virus replication are indeed available but they are, by and large, unable to eradicate the virus. Several alternative new treatment approaches are currently being developed but none have so far captured the interest of clinicians for possible clinical development. A constant feature of chronic HBV infection is T-cell exhaustion resulting from persistent exposure to high antigen concentrations as shown by the high expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) by HBV-specific CD8 T cells. One way of tackling this problem is to develop HBV-specific neutralizing antibodies that would clear excess envelope proteins from the circulation, allowing for nucleos(t)ide analogs or other antiviral drugs now in preclinical and early clinical development to take advantage of a reconstituted adaptive . Several fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been developed from HBV-vaccinated and subjects convalescent from acute hepatitis  that show different properties and specificities. It is envisaged that such neutralizing mAb may be used as adjuvant treatment to reduce viral protein load, thus rescuing adaptive  in an effort to optimize the effect of antiviral drugs.Copyright © 2019 Cerino, Mantovani, Mele, Oliviero, Varchetta and Mondelli.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614458>Function of miR825 and miR825* as Negative Regulators in  AR156-elicited Systemic Resistance to  in .</a></h2><p>Small RNAs function to regulate plant defense responses to pathogens. We previously showed that miR825 and miR825* downregulate  AR156 (AR156)-triggered systemic resistance to  pv.  DC3000 in  ().

Using unbiased mass spectrometry, we discover multiple serine phosphorylation sites in the MALT1 C terminus after T cell activation. Phospho-specific antibodies reveal that CBM-associated MALT1 is transiently hyper-phosphorylated upon TCR/CD28 co-stimulation. We identify a dual role for CK1α as a kinase that is essential for CBM signalosome assembly as well as MALT1 phosphorylation. Although MALT1 phosphorylation is largely dispensable for protease activity, it fosters canonical NF-κ signaling in Jurkat and murine CD4 T cells. Moreover, constitutive MALT1 phosphorylation promotes survival of activated  cell-type diffuse large  cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) cells addicted to chronic BCR signaling. Thus, MALT1 phosphorylation triggers optimal NF-κ activation in lymphocytes and survival of lymphoma cells.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Recent epidemiological data revealed the emergence of resistance to commonly used antibiotics, including increased numbers of both hospital- and community-acquired methicillin-resistant  (MRSA). Due to their potent antimicrobial functions, low potential to develop resistance, and immunogenicity, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising alternative treatment for multidrug-resistant strains. Here, we examined the activity of a lysine-rich derivative of amphibian temporin-1CEb (DK5) conjugated to peptides that exert pro-proliferative and/or cytoprotective activity. Analysis of a library of synthetic peptides to identify those with antibacterial potential revealed that the most potent agent against multidrug-resistant  was a conjugate of a temporin analogue with the synthetic Leu-enkephalin analogue dalargin (DAL). DAL-PEG-DK5 exerted direct bactericidal effects via bacterial membrane disruption, leading to eradication of both planktonic and biofilm-associated staphylococci. Finally, we showed that accumulation of the peptide in the cytoplasm of human keratinocytes led to a marked clearance of intracellular MRSA, resulting in cytoprotection against invading bacteria. Collectively, the data showed that DAL-PEG-DK5 might be a potent antimicrobial agent for treatment of staphylococcal skin infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605031>Adaptive : an emerging player in the progression of NAFLD.</a></h2><p>In the past decade, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a leading cause of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, as well as an important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver lesions, including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Although steatosis is often harmless, the lobular inflammation that characterizes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is considered a driving force in the progression of NAFLD. The current view is that innate immune mechanisms represent a key element in supporting hepatic inflammation in NASH. However, increasing evidence points to the role of adaptive  as an additional factor promoting liver inflammation. This Review discusses data regarding the role of  cells and T cells in sustaining the progression of NASH to fibrosis and HCC, along with the findings that antigens originating from oxidative stress act as a trigger for immune responses.

Studies have shown that for several vaccines, such as live attenuated, toxoid and conjugated vaccines, high maternal antibody titers inhibit the infant's humoral immune response after infant vaccination. However, it is not clear whether this decreased antibody titer has any clinical impact on the infant's protection, as the cellular immune responses are often equally important in providing disease protection and may therefore compensate for diminished antibody levels. Reports describing the effect of maternal antibodies on the cellular immune response after infant vaccination are scarce, probably because such studies are expensive, labor intensive and utilize poorly standardized laboratory techniques. Therefore, this review aims to shed light on what is currently known about the cellular immune responses after infant vaccination in the presence of high (maternal) antibody titers both in animal and human studies. Overall, the findings suggest that maternally derived antibodies do not interfere with the cellular immune responses after infant vaccination. However, more research in humans is clearly needed, as most data originate from animal studies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

One theory, the 'hygiene hypothesis', involves dysregulated  arising after too few beneficial early life microbe exposures. Indeed, earlier studies have shown that gut microbe-immune interactions contribute to smoldering inflammation, adiposity, and weight gain. Here we tested a safe and well-established microbe-based immune adjuvant to restore immune homeostasis and counteract inflammation-associated obesity in animal models. We found that consuming  exotoxin subunit  (ctB) was sufficient to inhibit age-associated obesogenic outcomes in wild type mice, including reduced crown-like structures (CLS) and granulomatous necrosis histopathology in fat depots. Administration of cholera toxin reduced weight gain irrespective of age during administration; however, exposure during youth imparted greater slenderizing effects when compared with animals receiving ctB for the first time during adulthood. Beneficial effects were transplantable to other obesity-prone animals using immune cells alone, demonstrating an immune-mediated mechanism. Taken together, we concluded that oral vaccination with cholera toxin  helps stimulate health-protective immune responses that counteract age-associated obesity.Copyright: © 2019 Varian et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671149>MEK inhibition suppresses  regulatory cells and augments anti-tumor .</a></h2><p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) is an integral component of the RAS pathway and a therapeutic target in RAS-driven cancers. Although tumor responses to MEK inhibition are rarely durable, MEK inhibitors have shown substantial activity and durable tumor regressions when combined with systemic immunotherapies in preclinical models of RAS-driven tumors. MEK inhibitors have been shown to potentiate anti-tumor T cell , but little is known about the effects of MEK inhibition on other immune subsets, including  cells. We show here that treatment with a MEK inhibitor reduces  regulatory cells (Bregs) in vitro, and reduces the number of Bregs in tumor draining lymph nodes in a colorectal cancer model in vivo. MEK inhibition does not impede anti-tumor humoral , and  cells contribute meaningfully to anti-tumor  in the context of MEK inhibitor therapy. Treatment with a MEK inhibitor is associated with improved T cell infiltration and an enhanced response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy.

It also enlightens our understanding on the host-microbe interactions within the physiological context of a living host. However, the responses of GF zebrafish to various colonization conditions such as bacterial concentrations, colonization time points, and exposure duration remain unclear. To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations, colonization time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or 5 dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate, colonization efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate , stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or 5 dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for 5 dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and , while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to  and stress responses. Moreover, our data revealed that GF zebrafish showed higher levels of physical activity than CONR and the microbial colonization reduced the hyperactivity of GF zebrafish, suggesting colonization of bacteria affected behavior characteristics.

In addition, we also evaluated the correlation of HHV-8 viral load with NFκ, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-12 levels. The expression of NFκ (p < 0.0001) or TNF-α (p < 0.0001) in  lymphocytes (CD19 +) and the IL-1β (p < 0.0266) and IL-12 (p < 0.0001) concentrations were associated with the presence of antibodies to HHV-8 lytic antigens. The CD19 + NFκ + TNF-α + and CD3 + NFκ + TNF-α + cells were also associated with the presence of antibodies to lytic infection (p < 0.0001). Among all PLHA evaluated, only individuals with the highest titers of lytic antibodies, i.e., 1:320, had detectable HHV-8 viral load.

However, the status of AGBL2 expression in ovarian cancer and its potential clinical and prognostic significance remain unclear. In the present study, immunohistochemistry staining investigated the protein expression level of AGBL2 in paraffin-embedded pathological specimens from 30 normal ovaries, 35 ovarian cystadenomas, 38 borderline ovarian tumors and 165 invasive ovarian carcinomas. The association between AGBL2 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of patients was evaluated using the χ test or Fisher's exact test. The survival status of patients was assessed by receiver-operator curve analysis. The results demonstrated that high expression of AGBL2 was observed in 9% of cystadenomas cases, 21% of borderline tumors cases and 38% of ovarian carcinomas cases; however AGBL2 expression was not high in normal ovarian tissues (P<0.01). Furthermore, the results demonstrated that high expression of AGBL2 was associated with tumor histological grade, advanced pT/pN/pM and cancer stage according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (P<0.05). Following univariate survival analysis of the ovarian carcinoma groups, high expression of AGBL2 was significantly associated with shorter patient survival (P<0.001). In addition, multivariate analysis revealed that AGBL2 could be identified as a potential independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma (P=0.004). Furthermore, the results demonstrated that AGBL2 expression was significantly associated with the expression of  related GTPase M (IRGM) (P=0.013) and LC3A/ (P=0.004). IRGM expression level was also significantly associated with LC3A/ expression level (P=0.023). These findings demonstrated that AGBL2 expression was high in ovarian carcinomas, which suggested that AGBL2 may participate in the acquisition of an aggressive phenotype and may therefore serve as an independent prognostic molecular marker.Copyright: © He et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587991>Liver-Derived Signals Sequentially Reprogram Myeloid Enhancers to Initiate and Maintain Kupffer Cell Identity.</a></h2><p>Tissue environment plays a powerful role in establishing and maintaining the distinct phenotypes of resident macrophages, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood.

We obtained evidence that combinatorial interactions of the Notch ligand DLL4 and transforming growth factor- (TGF-β) family ligands produced by sinusoidal endothelial cells and endogenous LXR ligands were required for the induction and maintenance of Kupffer cell identity. DLL4 regulation of the Notch transcriptional effector RBPJ activated poised enhancers to rapidly induce LXRα and other Kupffer cell lineage-determining factors.

A confirmed case of ZIKV infection was defined by ZIKV PRNT titer ratio ≥ 4 compared to four DENV serotypes.The mean age of the 212 participants was 54.0 years (standard deviation 13.7 years), and female was predominant (67.0%). Anti-ZIKV IgM and IgG were detected in 0 (0%) and 9 (4.2%) of the 212 participants, respectively. For the 9 samples with anti-ZIKV IgG, only 1 sample had 4 times higher ZIKV PRNT titers compared to PRNT titers against four dengue virus serotypes; this individual denied having traveled abroad.The results suggest that undetected indigenous ZIKV transmission might have occurred in Taiwan. The findings also suggest that the threat of epidemic transmission of ZIKV in Taiwan does exist due to extremely low-level of herd . Our study also indicates that serological tests for ZIKV-specific IgG remain a big challenge due to cross-reactivity, even in dengue non-endemic countries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639143>Skewed T cell responses to Epstein-Barr virus in long-term asymptomatic kidney transplant recipients.</a></h2><p>Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) abnormally replicate the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). To better understand how long-term immunosuppression impacts the immune control of this EBV re-emergence, we systematically compared 10 clinically stable KTRs to 30 healthy controls (HCs). The EBV-specific T cell responses were determined in both groups by multiparameter flow cytometry with intra cellular cytokine staining (KTRs n = 10; HCs n = 15) and ELISpot-IFNγ assays (KTRs n = 7; HCs n = 7). The T//NK cell counts (KTRs n = 10; HCs n = 30) and the NK/T cell differentiation and activation phenotypes (KTRs n = 10; HCs n = 15/30) were also measured. We show that in KTRs, the Th1 effector CD4+ T cell responses against latent EBV proteins are weak (2/7 responders). Conversely, the frequencies total EBV-specific CD8+T cells are conserved in KTRs (n = 10) and span a wider range of EBNA-3A peptides (5/7responders) than in HCs (5/7responders). Those modifications of the EBV-specific T cell response were associated with a profound CD4+ T cell lymphopenia in KTRs compared to HCs, involving the naïve CD4+ T cell subset, and a persistent activation of highly-differentiated senescent CD8+ T cells. The proportion of total NK / CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1 was also increased in KTRs. Noteworthy, PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells normalized with time after transplantation. In conclusion, we show modifications of the EBV-specific cellular  in long term transplant recipients. This may be the result of both persistent EBV antigenic stimulation and profound immunosuppression induced by anti-rejection treatments. These findings provide new insights into the immunopathology of EBV infection after renal transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555223>Association Between Impaired Vα7.2+CD161++CD8+ (MAIT) and Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ T-Cell Populations and Gut Dysbiosis in Chronically HIV- and/or HCV-Infected Patients.</a></h2><p>Both HIV and HCV infections feature increased microbial translocation (MT) and gut dysbiosis that affect immune homeostasis and disease outcome. Given their commitment to antimicrobial mucosal , we investigated mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and Vα7.2+CD161- T-cell frequency/function and their possible associations with MT and gut dysbiosis, in chronic HIV and/or HCV infections. We enrolled 56 virally infected (VI) patients (pts): 13 HIV+ on suppressive cART (HIV-RNA < 40cp/ml), 13 HCV+ naive to DAA (direct-acting antiviral) anti-HCV agents; 30 HCV+/HIV+ on suppressive cART and naive to anti-HCV. 13 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. For Vα7.2+CD161++ and Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ T cells we assessed: activation (CD69), exhaustion (PD1/CD39), and cytolytic activity (granzymeB/perforin). Following PMA/ionomycin and  stimulation we measured intracellular IL17/TNFα/IFNγ. Markers of microbial translocation (Plasma LPS, 16S rDNA, EndoCAb and I-FABP) were quantified. In 5 patients per group we assessed stool microbiota composition by 16S targeted metagenomics sequencing (alpha/beta diversity, relative abundance). Compared to controls, virally infected pts displayed significantly lower circulating Vα7.2+CD161++CD8+ MAIT cells ( = 0.001), yet expressed higher perforin ( = 0.004) and granzyme  ( = 0.002) on CD8+ MAIT cells. Upon  stimulation, the residual MAIT cells are less functional particularly those from HIV+/HCV+ patients. Conversely, in virally infected pts, Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ cells were comparable in frequency, highly activated/exhausted (CD69+:  = 0.002; PD-1+:  = 0.030) and with cytolytic potential (perforin+:  < 0.0001), yet were poorly responsive to  stimulation. A profound gut dysbiosis characterized virally infected pts, especially HCV+/HIV+ co-infected patients, delineating a -poor/rich microbiota, with significant associations with MAIT cell frequency/function. Irrespective of mono/dual infection, HIV+ and HCV+ patients display depleted, yet activated/cytolytic MAIT cells with reduced  function, suggesting an impoverished pool, possibly due to continuous bacterial challenge. The MAIT cell ability to respond to bacterial stimulation correlates with the presence of  and , possibly suggesting an association between gut dysbiosis and MAIT cell function and posing viral-mediated dysbiosis as a potential key player in the hampered anti-bacterial MAIT ability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649895>The Quest for a Truly Universal Influenza Vaccine.</a></h2><p>There is an unmet public health need for a universal influenza vaccine (UIV) to provide broad and durable protection from influenza virus infections. The identification of broadly protective antibodies and cross-reactive T cells directed to influenza viral targets present a promising prospect for the development of a UIV. Multiple targets for cross-protection have been identified in the stalk and head of hemagglutinin (HA) to develop a UIV. Recently, neuraminidase (NA) has received significant attention as a critical component for increasing the breadth of protection. The HA stalk-based approaches have shown promising results of broader protection in animal studies, and their feasibility in humans are being evaluated in clinical trials. Mucosal immune responses and cross-reactive T cell  across influenza A and  viruses intrinsic to live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) have emerged as essential features to be incorporated into a UIV. Complementing the weakness of the stand-alone approaches, prime-boost vaccination combining HA stalk, and LAIV is under clinical evaluation, with the aim to increase the efficacy and broaden the spectrum of protection. Preexisting  in humans established by prior exposure to influenza viruses may affect the hierarchy and magnitude of immune responses elicited by an influenza vaccine, limiting the interpretation of preclinical data based on naive animals, necessitating human challenge studies. A consensus is yet to be achieved on the spectrum of protection, efficacy, target population, and duration of protection to define a "universal" vaccine. This review discusses the recent advancements in the development of UIVs, rationales behind cross-protection and vaccine designs, and challenges faced in obtaining balanced protection potency, a wide spectrum of protection, and safety relevant to UIVs.Copyright © 2019 Jang and Seong.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574574>Adzuki Bean Water Extract Attenuates Obesity by Modulating M2/M1 Macrophage Polarization and Gut Microbiota Composition.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a chronic condition resulting in excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissues. Adipose tissue is now considered as an immune organ, at the crossroads between metabolism and . Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on obesity and gut microbiota in high fat diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces body weight and adipose tissue weight in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing M2-polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit adipogenesis via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression. Moreover, the studies confirm that AWE decreases obesity through modulating gut microbiota.The results demonstrate that AWE supplementation ameliorates high fat diet-induced obesity and gut microbiota composition and suggests that AWE may have the potential to be developed into a functional food to improve metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We sought to examine how the genetic variants of the MSY influence male susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis. Approach and Results: Analysis of 129 133 men from UK Biobank revealed that only one of 7 common MSY haplogroups (haplogroup I1) was associated with CAD-carriers of haplogroup I1 had ≈11% increase in risk of CAD when compared with all other haplogroups combined (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18; =6.8×10). Targeted MSY sequencing uncovered 235 variants exclusive to this haplogroup. The haplogroup I1-specific variants showed 2.45- and 1.56-fold respective enrichment for promoter and enhancer chromatin states, in cells/tissues relevant to atherosclerosis, when compared with other MSY variants.

Previous studies have warned that booster regimens should be considered to guarantee the long-term persistence of 17DD-YF-specific memory components in adults living in areas with YF-virus circulation. Considering the lower seroconversion rates observed in children (9-12 months of age) as compared to adults, this study was designed in order to access the duration of  in single-dose vaccinated children in a 10-years cross-sectional time-span. The levels of neutralizing antibodies (PRNT) and the phenotypic/functional memory status of T and -cells were measured at a baseline, 30-45 days, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 years following primary vaccination. The results revealed that a single dose induced 85% of seropositivity at 30-45 days and a progressive time-dependent decrease was observed as early as 2 years and declines toward critical values (below 60%) at time-spans of ≥4-years. Moreover, short-lived YF-specific cellular , mediated by memory T and -cells was also observed after 4-years. Predicted probability and resultant memory analysis emphasize that correlates of protection (PRNT; effector memory CD8 T-cells; non-classical memory -cells) wane to critical values within ≥4-years after primary vaccination. Together, these results clearly demonstrate the decline of 17DD-YF-specific memory response along time in children primarily vaccinated at 9-12 months of age and support the need of booster regimen to guarantee the long-term persistence of memory components for children living in areas with high risk of YF transmission.Copyright © 2019 Campi-Azevedo, Reis, Peruhype-Magalhães, Coelho-dos-Reis, Antonelli, Fonseca, Costa-Pereira, Souza-Fagundes, Costa-Rocha, Mambrini, Lemos, Ribeiro, Caldas, Camacho, Maia, de Noronha, de Lima, Simões, Freire, Martins, Homma, Tauil, Vasconcelos, Romano, Domingues, Teixeira-Carvalho and Martins-Filho.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658782>Methotrexate an Old Drug with New Tricks.</a></h2><p>Methotrexate (MTX) is the first line drug for the treatment of a number of rheumatic and non-rheumatic disorders. It is currently used as an anchor disease, modifying anti-rheumatic drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite the development of numerous new targeted therapies, MTX remains the backbone of RA therapy due to its potent efficacy and tolerability. There has been also a growing interest in the use of MTX in the treatment of chronic viral mediated arthritis.

It weakens the immune system by targeting the T-helper cells. Specifically, the severity of the pandemic HIV-1 makes the emergence of an enduring effective vaccine against HIV-1. Therefore, we have applied a series of immunoinformatics approaches to the four conserved domains of HIV-1 integrase (IN) proteins to design an effective multi-epitope based subunit vaccine which might induce a competent  against HIV-1. Therefore, we have selected three peptide fragments that contained all overlapping epitopes (35 CD4, 8 CD8 T-cell epitopes, and 3 -cell epitopes) where the epitopes had a high conservancy score. The cumulative population coverage for combined CD8 and CD4 T-cell epitopes and their respective HLA-alleles were found as 98.03% in the world which is also followed by East Asia (96.24%), South Asia (96.31%), North Africa (96.14%), North America (98.99%), and Europe (98.80%). The proposed vaccine composed by an adjuvant (β-defensin) at the N-terminal site of the vaccine constructs and three peptide fragments where the adjuvant was fused by EAAAK linker and the peptide fragments were fused by GPGPG linker. The designed final vaccine construct (length: 159 amino acid) was found to be antigenic and non-allergic, which indicates its safety. The vaccine construct was found as good antigenic, stable, higher thermostable, and hydrophilic in nature. The codon adaptation and in silico cloning ensured the high expression rate of the vaccine constructs in E. coli K12 with CAI value of 1.0. Finally, the binding affinity of the vaccine constructs with the immune receptor TLR3 was confirmed by the lowest energy score of -1026.8 evaluated by molecular docking. However, the proposed in silico vaccine construct needs experimental validation for assuring the safety and immunogenicity profile which will ensure an active  against HIV-1.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 30 younger children with severe burn injuries, conforming to the study criteria, were admitted to our hospital from July 2016 to July 2018. They were enrolled in the prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial and divided into group rhGH [=15, 10 boys and 5 girls, aged (22±10) months] and control group [=15, 8 boys and 7 girls, aged (21±7) months] according to the random number table. The patients in control group received anti-shock, anti-infection, and wound caring therapies, etc. On the basis of above-mentioned treatment, the patients in group rhGH were subcutaneously injected with rhGH once every night before bedding, with a dosage of 0.2 IU·kg(-1)·d(-1), from the 3rd day post injury for 7 consecutive days. Before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatments, the fasting peripheral venous blood was collected from patients in both groups. Blood glucose level was detected by glucometer. Percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes, CD8(+) T lymphocytes, CD3(+) T lymphocytes, CD19(+)  lymphocytes, and ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometer. Mass concentration of serum immune globulin (Ig) A, IgG, and complement C3 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test, independent sample  test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement and Bonferroni correction, and Mann-Whitney  test.

Many studies have demonstrated that IL-37 owns immunosuppressive effects against both innate and acquired immune responses via inhibition of several inflammatory mediators. Thence, IL-37 has anti-inflammatory action in some diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and infectious diseases. Recent investigations have reported the important role of IL-37 in  against viral, bacterial and fungal infections as they prevent inappropriate immune activation and suppress the inflammation induced by these infectious agents. Thus, IL-37 could play a crucial role in protecting host tissues from injury during infections by damping excessive inflammatory reactions. However, the precise roles of IL-37 in infectious diseases remain largely unknown. The current review shed light on the pivotal role of IL-37 in infectious diseases such as the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), viral myocarditis, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis  virus (HBV), tuberculosis, leprosy, pneumococcal pneumonia, listeria infection, aspergillosis, candidiasis and eumycetoma. In conclusion, this review reported that IL-37 has a crucial role in reducing infection-associated inflammation and has a good impact on inflammation-induced pathology. However, tight regulation that achieved balance between effector immune responses that required for pathogen elimination and limited tissue damage that resulted from excessive inflammation should be existed in the potential IL-37 therapy to prevent clinical complications of a disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649248>Occurrence and repair of alkylating stress in the intracellular pathogen Brucella abortus.</a></h2><p>It is assumed that intracellular pathogenic bacteria have to cope with DNA alkylating stress within host cells.

Fasciolosis causes a significant economic impact on the agricultural sector and affects human health. Due to the increasing prevalence of triclabendazole resistance in F. hepatica, alternative treatment methods are required. Many protein antigens have been trialled as vaccine candidates with low success, however, the tegument of F. hepatica is highly glycosylated and the parasite-derived glycoconjugate molecules have been identified as an important mediator in host-parasite interactions and as prime targets for the host immune system. Galectin-11 (LGALS-11) and galectin-14 (LGALS-14) are two ruminant-specific glycan-binding proteins, showing upregulation in the bile duct of sheep infected with F. hepatica, which are believed to mediate host-parasite interaction and innate  against internal parasites. For the first known time, this study presents the ligand profile of whole worm and tegument extracts of F. hepatica that interacted with immobilised LGALS-11 and LGALS-14. LGALS-14 interacted with a total of 255 F. hepatica proteins. The protein which had the greatest interaction was identified as an uncharacterised protein which contained a C-type lectin domain. Many of the other proteins identified were previously trialled vaccine candidates including glutathione S-transferase, paramyosin, cathepsin L, cathepsin , fatty acid binding protein and leucine aminopeptidase. In comparison to LGALS-14, LGALS-11 interacted with only 49 F. hepatica proteins and it appears to have a much smaller number of binding partners in F. hepatica. This is, to our knowledge, the first time host-specific lectins have been used for the enrichment of F. hepatica glycoproteins and this study has identified a number of glycoproteins that play critical roles in host-parasite interactions which have the potential to be novel vaccine candidates.Copyright © 2019 Australian Society for Parasitology.

Dysregulated antibody production in the form of autoantibodies can cause autoimmune disease. To date, -cell depletion with anti-CD20 antibodies is commonly applied in autoimmunity, but pre-existing plasma cells are not eliminated in this way. Alternative ways of more selective inhibition of antibody production would add to the treatment of these autoimmune diseases. To explore novel therapeutic targets in signaling pathways essential for plasmablast formation and/or immunoglobulin production, we performed a compound screen of almost 200 protein kinase inhibitors in a robust -cell differentiation culture system. This study yielded 35 small cell-permeable compounds with a reproducible inhibitory effect on -cell activation and plasmablast formation, among which was the clinically applied mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Two additional compounds targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (BKM120 and WYE-354), did not affect proliferation and plasmablast formation, but specifically reduced the immunoglobulin production. With this compound screen we successfully applied a method to investigate therapeutic targets for -cell differentiation and identified compounds in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway that could specifically inhibit immunoglobulin production only.

Bregs have been reported to regulate acute inflammation and  through the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.A  cell subpopulation was identified using flow cytometric analysis in two different processes: 1) after preparation and storage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation from a human blood sample, 2) followed by isolation and storage of  cells through magnetic separation using a  cell isolation kit and MS column. ELISA assays were performed to observe the cytokine production of interkleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) by this novel  cell subpopulation.Double positive staining of CD5+CD1d+ Bregs represents (19.27 ±1.52) from PBMCs, (33.32 ±2.95) from  cells accordingly ( = 40). Through ELISA assays, it has been found that  cell subpopulation produces IL-10 (0.56 ±0.08) and TGF-β (0.90 ±0.12) ( = 40).These methods should be able to facilitate progress in research on Bregs through the following steps: 1) the regulatory role may be observed in comparison with particular autoimmune diseases, inflammation, cancer, and immunologic responses to find out whether Breg alteration and/or cytokine production is altered as well in these disorders or conditions. 2) If the alteration of Bregs and cytokine production is significant along with the clinical correlation, a further  study can be initiated with exposure of certain drugs to overcome the alteration of the cytokine production; then, an  study can be initiated.Copyright: © 2018 Termedia & Banach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560728>Regulatory interaction between the ZPBP2-ORMDL3/Zpbp2-Ormdl3 region and the circadian clock.</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci for several -mediated diseases (early onset asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), primary biliary cholangitis, and rheumatoid arthritis) map to chromosomal region 17q12-q21. The predominant view is that association between 17q12-q21 alleles and increased risk of developing asthma or IBD is due to regulatory variants. ORM sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator (ORMDL3) residing in this region is the most promising gene candidate for explaining association with disease. However, the relationship between 17q12-q21 alleles and disease is complex suggesting contributions from other factors, such as trans-acting genetic and environmental modifiers or circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms regulate expression levels of thousands of genes and their dysregulation is implicated in the etiology of several common chronic inflammatory diseases. However, their role in the regulation of the 17q12-q21 genes has not been investigated. Moreover, the core clock gene nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) resides about 200 kb distal to the GWAS region. We hypothesized that circadian rhythms influenced gene expression levels in 17q12-q21 region and conversely, regulatory elements in this region influenced transcription of the core clock gene NR1D1 in cis. To test these hypotheses, we examined the diurnal expression profiles of zona pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2/Zpbp2), gasdermin  (GSDMB), and ORMDL3/Ormdl3 in human and mouse tissues and analyzed the impact of genetic variation in the ZPBP2/Zpbp2 region on NR1D1/Nr1d1 expression. We found that Ormdl3 and Zpbp2 were controlled by the circadian clock in a tissue-specific fashion. We also report that deletion of the Zpbp2 region altered the expression profile of Nr1d1 in lungs and ileum in a time-dependent manner. In liver, the deletion was associated with enhanced expression of Ormdl3. We provide the first evidence that disease-associated genes Zpbp2 and Ormdl3 are regulated by circadian rhythms and the Zpbp2 region influences expression of the core clock gene Nr1d1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656948>Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP): the elusive 'hunger factor' linking autophagy to food intake.</a></h2><p>The best-known appetite-regulating factors identified in rodents are leptin, an appetite inhibitor, and ghrelin, an appetite stimulator. Rare cases of loss-of-functions mutations affecting leptin and its receptor, as well as polymorphisms concerning ghrelin and its receptor, have been documented in human obesity, apparently validating the relevance of leptin and ghrelin for human physiology. Paradoxically, however, the overwhelming majority of obese individuals manifest high leptin and low ghrelin plasma levels, suggesting that both factors are not directly disease-relevant. We recently discovered that acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), also known as diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), acts as an efficient lipogenic and appetite stimulator in mice. Indeed, in response to starvation, ACBP/DBI is released from tissues in an autophagy-dependent fashion and increases in the plasma. Intravenous injection of ACBP/DBI stimulates feeding behavior through a reduction of circulating glucose levels, and consequent activation of orexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus. In contrast, neutralization of ACBP/DBI abolishes the hyperphagia observed after starvation of mice. Of note, ACBP/DBI is increased in the plasma of obese persons and mice, pointing to a convergence (rather than divergence) between its role in appetite stimulation and human obesity. Based on our results, we postulate a novel 'hunger reflex' in which starvation induces a surge in extracellular ACBP/DBI, which in turn stimulates feeding behavior. Thus, ACBP/DBI might be the elusive 'hunger factor' that explains increased food uptake in obesity.Copyright: © 2019 Bravo-San Pedro et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666653>MicroRNA-146a-deficient mice develop immune complex glomerulonephritis.</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the kidneys under physiological and pathological conditions, but their role in immune glomerulonephritis is unclear. miR-146a has been identified as a key player in innate  and inflammatory responses, and in the kidney, this miRNA is involved in the response of injured tubular cells. We studied the renal and immune phenotypes of miR-146a and miR-146a mice at 12 months of age, and the results showed that miR-146a mice developed autoimmunity during aging, as demonstrated by circulating antibodies targeting double-stranded DNA and an immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis associated with a mild renal immune infiltrate. In addition, miR-146a mice showed reduced expression of the transmembrane protein Kim1/Tim1, a key regulator of regulatory  cell (Breg) homeostasis, in the kidney and the immune cells. The numbers of memory  cells and plasmablasts were increased in miR-146a mice compared with the numbers in wild-type mice, whereas Bregs were decreased in number and displayed an altered capacity to produce IL-10. Finally, we showed that miR-146a mice develop an autoimmune syndrome with increasing age, and this syndrome includes immune complex glomerulonephritis, which might be due to altered  cell responses associated with Kim1/Tim1 deficiency. This study unravels a link between miR-146a and Kim1 and identifies miR-146a as a significant player in immune-mediated glomerulonephritis pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587575>[Hungarian recommendation for the immunization of health-care personnel against hepatitis  virus].</a></h2><p>More than 200 million HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, hepatitis  virus (HBV) carriers live worldwide.

In both mice and humans, IAV-specific T cell responses are protective during primary as well as homologous and heterologous challenge infections. Many mouse studies have focused on CD4 T cells specific for a single, known model or IAV antigen. However, studies have demonstrated that the IAV-specific CD4 T cell response comprises many epitopes spread across multiple viral proteins. Therefore, herein we track the antigen-experienced CD4 T cell response using the surrogate markers CD49d and CD11a. This novel surrogate marker method allows us to characterize the full IAV-specific CD4 T cell response without the potential bias that could occur when examining an individual Ag-specificity. Our findings demonstrate that the immunodominant I-A-binding NP epitope often used in studies of IAV-specific CD4 T cells represents only about 5% of the total IAV-specific CD4 T cell response. Further, we find that the kinetics of the full pulmonary CD4 T cell response is similar to that of NP-specific T cells and that the full CD4 T cell response in the lungs is predominantly composed of cells expressing the Th1 transcription factor T-bet, with smaller but significant portions of the response expressing the Treg and Tfh associated transcription factors Foxp3 and Bcl-6, respectively. Interestingly, although Th1 cells are the most abundant Th subset in the lungs of both BALB/c and C57Bl/6 mice following IAV, the relative abundance of Treg and Tfh is reversed in the different mouse strains. In BALB/c mice, Foxp3 cells are more abundant than Bcl6 cells, whereas in C57Bl/6 mice, there are more Bcl6 cells. As a whole, these data highlight the diversity of the endogenous CD4 T cell response to a primary IAV infection, providing an important context for past and future studies of the IAV-specific CD4 T cell response.Copyright © 2019 Hornick, Zacharias and Legge.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624262>Targeting the mTOR pathway uncouples the efficacy and toxicity of PD-1 blockade in renal transplantation.</a></h2><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) use remains a challenge in patients with solid organ allografts as most would undergo rejection. In a melanoma patient in whom programmed-death 1 (PD-1) blockade resulted in organ rejection and colitis, the addition of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus resulted in ongoing anti-tumor efficacy while promoting allograft tolerance. Strong granzyme , interferon (IFN)-γ CD8 cytotoxic T cell and circulating regulatory T (T) cell responses were noted during allograft rejection, along with significant eosinophilia and elevated serum IL-5 and eotaxin levels. Co-treatment with sirolimus abated cytotoxic T cell numbers and eosinophilia, while elevated T cell numbers in the peripheral blood were maintained. Interestingly, numbers of IFN-γ CD4 T cells and serum IFN-γ levels increased with the addition of sirolimus treatment likely promoting ongoing anti-PD-1 efficacy.

In this study, we aim to investigate if POR is associated with serum 25(OH) vitamin D (VD) levels and pro-inflammatory immune responses in infertile women with a history of in-vitro fertilization and embryo transfer failures. A retrospective cross-sectional study included 157 women with IVF failures. Study patients were divided into four groups based on serum 25(OH)VD level and ovarian responses during the most recent IVF cycle; low VD (LVD) with POR, LVD with normal ovarian response (NOR), normal VD (NVD) with POR, and NVD with NOR. Serum 25(OH)VD level, cellular- and auto-, and metabolic parameters, including homocysteine and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were investigated. Peripheral blood CD56 NK cell levels (%) and NK cytotoxicity were significantly higher in POR-LVD when compared to the other groups (P < 0.05, respectively). CD19 +  and CD19+/5+ -1 cell levels were significantly higher in women with POR-LVD as compared with those of NOR-LVD and POR-NVD (P < 0.05, respectively). TNF-α/IL-10 producing Th1/Th2 cell ratio of POR-LVD was significantly higher than those of POR-NVD and NOR-NVD (P < 0.05 respectively). Peripheral blood homocysteine level of POR-LVD was significantly higher than those of NOR-LVD and POR-NVD (P < 0.05 respectively). We conclude that assessment of cellular and autoimmune abnormalities and metabolic factors, such as homocysteine should be considered in women with POR and LVD. VD and folic acid supplementation may be explored further as a possible therapeutic option for POR with immune and metabolic etiologies.Copyright © 2019.

The pathogenesis of ITP is complex and has not been fully elucidated. Currently, researches on the pathogenesis of ITP mainly focus on the disorders of humoral  and cellular . In recent years, some new progress has been made in the study of this pathogenesis, including the platelet clearance pathway that is not dependent on Fc γ R mediation, the metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10 that can regulate T and  cells, and the abnormal expression of micro RNA in genetic factors. Under the joint action of multiple factors, the imbalance of the immune system in the body leads to the occurrence of ITP.

The HLA-*3906 and HLA-A*2402 class I genes confer increased risk and promote early disease onset, suggesting that CD8+ T cells that recognize peptides presented by these class I molecules on pancreatic β-cells play a pivotal role in the autoimmune response. We examined the frequency and phenotype of circulating preproinsulin (PPI)-specific and Insulin  (InsB)-specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-*3906+ children newly diagnosed with T1D and in high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children before the appearance of disease-specific autoantibodies and before diagnosis of T1D. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were detected using HLA class I tetramers and flow cytometry was used to assess memory status. In HLA-*3906+ children with T1D, we observed an increase in PPI -specific transitional memory CD8+ T cells compared to non-diabetic, age- and HLA-matched subjects. Furthermore, PPI -specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-*3906+ children with T1D showed a significantly more antigen-experienced phenotype compared to polyclonal CD8+ T cells. In longitudinal samples from high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children, the percentage of terminal effector cells within the InsB -specific CD8+ T cells was increased before diagnosis relative to samples taken before the appearance of autoantibodies. This is the first study to report HLA-*3906-restricted autoreactive CD8+ T cells in T1D. Collectively, our results provide evidence that β-cell-reactive CD8+ T cells restricted by disease-associated HLA class I molecules display an antigen-experienced phenotype and acquire enhanced effector function during the period leading to clinical diagnosis, implicating these cells in driving disease.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660347>Impact of Maternal HIV Infection and Placental Malaria on the Transplacental Transfer of Influenza Antibodies in Mother-Infant Pairs in Malawi, 2013-2014.</a></h2><p>Maternal influenza vaccination protects infants against influenza virus infection.

HIV-infected mothers were excluded in Chikwawa. Maternal and cord blood antibodies against circulating influenza strains A/California/7/2009, A/Victoria/361/2011, /Brisbane/60/2008, and /Wisconsin/1/2010 were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI). We studied the impact of maternal HIV infection and placental malaria on influenza antibody levels in mother-infant pairs in Blantyre and Chikwawa, respectively.We included 454 mother-infant pairs (Blantyre, n = 253; Chikwawa, n = 201).

In particular, the analysis of cardiac strain plays an important role in the identification of several cardiovascular diseases. However, this imaging technique presents some limitations associated with its operating principle that result in low accuracy and reproducibility of the measurement. In this study, an experimental framework for multimodal strain imaging in an in vitro porcine heart was developed. Specifically, the aim of this work was to analyse displacement and strain in the heart by means of 3D digital image correlation (3D-DIC) and US-2D-STE. Over a single cardiac cycle, displacement values obtained from the two techniques were in strong correlation, although systematically larger displacements were observed with 3D-DIC. Notwithstanding an absolute comparison of the strain measurements was not possible to achieve between the two methods, maximum principal strain directions computed with 3D-DIC were consistent with the longitudinal and circumferential strain distribution measured with US-2D-STE. 3D-DIC confirmed its high repeatability in quantifying displacement and strain over multiple cardiac cycles, unlike US-2D-STE which is affected by accumulated errors over time (i.e. drift). To conclude, this study demonstrates the potential of 3D-DIC to perform dynamic measurement of displacement and strain during heart deformations and supports future applications of this method in ex vivo beating heart platforms, which replicate more fully the complex contraction of the heart.Copyright © 2019.

However, the role and associated mechanisms of IL-34 in HBV-related HCC remain unclear. In this study, the expression, biological function and associated mechanisms of IL-34 in HBV-related HCC cells were investigated.IL-34 expression induced by HBV and HBV X (HBX) gene was measured in hepatoma cells. The role of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (CEBP/α) in HBX-induced IL-34 expression was examined. The signal pathways involved in the expression of CEBP/α and IL-34 induced by HBX were assessed. The role of IL-34 in the proliferation and migration of HCC cells, and related mechanisms were explored.Dependent on HBX, HBV increased IL-34 expression in hepatoma cells, and HBX upregulated and interacted with CEBP/α to enhance the activity of IL-34 promoters. CEBP/α mediated by HBX was associated with the activation of PI3-K and NF-κ pathways to promote IL-34 expression. Via CSF1-R and CD138, IL-34 promoted the proliferation and migration of hepatoma cells, and contributed to the activation of ERK and STAT3 pathways and the upregulation of Bcl-xl and c-Myc mediated by HBX.We demonstrate that IL-34 contributes to HBX-mediated functional abnormality of HCC cells and provides a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of carcinogenesis mediated by HBX.© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, these responses were evaluated after different doses of the bivalent (2v) HPV-vaccine in girls.Blood was collected yearly up to seven years post-vaccination with one-, two- or three-doses of the 2vHPV vaccine (N = 890). HPV-type-specific IgG and IgA-antibody levels, IgG-isotypes and avidity indexes were measured by a virus-like-particle-based multiplex-immuno-assay for two vaccine and five non-vaccine HPV types. HPV-type-specific memory -cell numbers- and T-cell cytokine responses were determined in a subpopulation.HPV-type-specific antibody concentrations were significantly lower in one- than in two- and three-dose vaccinated girls but remained stable over seven years. The lower antibody response coincided with reduced HPV-type-specific - and T-cell responses. There were no differences in both the IgG subtypes and the avidity of the HPV16-specific antibodies between the groups.One-dose of the 2vHPV vaccine is immunogenic, but results in less - and T-cell memory and considerable lower antibody responses when compared with more doses.

The innate immune system is the first to respond to pathogens and does not retain memory of previous responses. Innate immune responses are evolutionarily older than adaptive responses and elements of innate  can be found in all multicellular organisms. If a pathogen persists, the adaptive immune system will engage the pathogen with specificity and memory. Several components of the adaptive system including immunoglobulins (Igs), T cell receptors (TCR), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC), are assumed to have arisen in the first jawed vertebrates-the Gnathostomata. This review will discuss and compare components of both the innate and adaptive immune systems in Gnathostomes, particularly in Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) and in Osteichthyes [bony fish: the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish) and the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish)]. While many elements of both the innate and adaptive immune systems are conserved within these species and with higher level vertebrates, some elements have marked differences. Components of the innate immune system covered here include physical barriers, such as the skin and gastrointestinal tract, cellular components, such as pattern recognition receptors and immune cells including macrophages and neutrophils, and humoral components, such as the complement system. Components of the adaptive system covered include the fundamental cells and molecules of adaptive :  lymphocytes ( cells), T lymphocytes (T cells), immunoglobulins (Igs), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC).

Drugs inhibiting -cell-receptor (BCR)-associated kinases, including BTK inhibitors, act on  cells and on a wide spectrum of tissues and cells, including innate  cells. Thus, alterations in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) kinase function could lead to an impairment of innate immune cells functions and to an increased infectious risk in patients receiving BTK inhibitors. We analyzed in vivo neutrophils oxidative burst, neutrophils granules release and cytokine production in relapsed/refractory CLL patients treated over time with ibrutinib as single-agent. We observed a dramatic reduction of neutrophils oxidative burst, Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs)-mediated degranulation and IL-8 plasma levels already after the first forty-eight hours of therapy with ibrutinib. However, ibrutinib treatment did not alter the surface expression of CD11b nor cytokine and proteinases release not mediated by FcγRs engagement. After three weeks, oxidative burst was still impaired, while degranulation and IL-8 levels were restored. In a group of CLL patients who survived for more than three years, all processes triggered by FcγRs completely recovered except the release of neutrophil elastase (NE) and IL-8. In conclusion, during the initial phases of ibrutinib therapy, the reduction of IL-8, NE, myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels and oxidative burst negatively impacted on mechanisms involved in neutrophils microbicidal activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Healthcare workers (HCWs), including medical students and resident doctors, have an occupational risk of HBV infection. The study aimed to evaluate the long-term persistence of protective anti-HBs antibody levels in healthcare students and resident doctors at risk for occupational exposure to HBV at 15 years after primary vaccination course. Further objective was to evaluate the anamnestic response observed in non-seroprotected subjects receiving a booster dose. Data were collected from the clinical documentation filled in during the occupational medical check of medical students and resident doctors undergoing Occupational Health Surveillance by the University of Ferrara. Of the 621 included individuals, 27.7% had an anti-HBs concentration < 10 mIU/mL. Subjects vaccinated during infancy had more frequently a concentration < 10 mIU/mL than those vaccinated during adolescence (42.7% vs 6.9%; p-value < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the statistical significance of the vaccination age. 94 subjects who had an anti-HBs concentration < 10 mIU/mL received a booster dose. The proportion of subjects who had an anamnestic response was higher in those vaccinated in infancy rather than during adolescence (94.1% vs 77.8% respectively). These findings suggest that the anti-HBs concentration decreases below 10 mIU/mL more frequently in subjects vaccinated during infancy. Immunological memory seems to persist after the decline of the anti-HB titer, as observed in response to a booster dose. In conclusion, vaccinated subjects at increased risk of HBV infection should be monitored and a booster dose administered if anti-HBs titer is below 10 mIU/mL.©2019 Pacini Editore SRL, Pisa, Italy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598889>Apremilast Normalizes Gene Expression of Inflammatory Mediators in Human Keratinocytes and Reduces Antigen-Induced Atopic Dermatitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in psoriasis, while its efficacy in atopic dermatitis (AD) was found to be modest. AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with activation of T helper (Th) 2 and Th17  and a compromised epidermal barrier.The objectives of this study were to examine the expression of PDE4 isoforms in skin from healthy subjects and AD patients, and to determine the effects of apremilast on AD-related inflammatory markers in vitro and in murine models of AD.The expression of PDE4 isoforms (A, , C, and D) in skin biopsies from healthy subjects and AD patients was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis. Using quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we evaluated the effects of apremilast on gene expression in adult human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKa) stimulated by Th2 and Th17 cytokines, and in two mouse models of antigen-induced AD.Expression of PDE4 isoforms increased up to three-fold in the epidermis of AD patients versus healthy skin. In interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17-stimulated HEKa cells, apremilast significantly changed the expression of ILs, including IL-12/IL-23p40 and IL-31, and alarmins S100A7, S100A8, and S100A12. In mouse models of AD, apremilast significantly reduced ear swelling and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression.PDE4 is overexpressed in AD skin compared with normal skin, and inflammatory gene expression by human keratinocytes and mouse dermatitis can be modulated by apremilast.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654988>Total Glucosides of Paeony protects against collagen-induced mouse arthritis via inhibiting follicular helper T cell differentiation.</a></h2><p>The development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is related to germinal center (GC) response and autoreactive T cells, which mediate adaptive  and play an important role in stimulating the production of autoantibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines by  cells and macrophages. Total Glucosides of Paeony (TGP) has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and analgesic effects and is widely used to treat RA. However, few studies investigated whether the therapeutic effect of TGP is associated with the inhibition of autoimmune response.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of TGP on RA.Type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model was used, and TGP and paeoniflorin were intragastrically treated.DBA/1 mice were divided into 5 groups: control, model, positive drug (paeoniflorin) and high- and low-dose TGP group. After 21 days of intragastric administration, the pathological change, inflammation expression and molecular mechanism of each group of mice were detected by Micro-CT, histochemical analysis, ELLSA, Western blot, RT-qPCR and flow cytometry.Our study found that TGP treatment effectively improved inflammation and joint destruction in CIA mice. It reduced the production of serum IgG2a and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including serum interleukin (IL)-21, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6, and the phosphorylation of NF-κ p65 and STAT3 in a dose-dependent manner. More importantly, TGP could suppress the frequency of germinal center  cells and Tfh cells in the spleen.TGP can not only improve symptoms, but also inhibit bone destruction. The therapeutic effect of TGP on CIA is mainly achieved by inhibiting spleen Tfh cell differentiation and GC formation through STAT3 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.
