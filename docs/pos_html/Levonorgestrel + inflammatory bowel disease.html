Women, whether with chronic conditions or not, and their infants are more likely to be healthy when pregnancies are planned. Achieving a planned pregnancy at the ideal time or preventing pregnancy altogether requires the use of appropriate contraceptives. There is a broad range of contraceptives available to women in the USA, and the majority of women with digestive  will be candidates for all effective methods. Guidance from the Centers for  Control and Prevention aids clinicians in prescribing appropriate contraceptives to women with medical disorders. This review will focus on contraception for women with  and chronic liver , including liver transplant.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12885311>Exacerbation of Crohn's disease after insertion of a  intrauterine system: a case report.</a></h2><p>The case report describes a relapse of Crohn's disease in a woman soon after the fitting of a  intrauterine system (IUS). Whilst the published evidence on the effects of  IUS in patients with pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease is limited, reports to date suggest that caution should be exercised when considering fitting an IUS in such women, even if there appears to be much to gain from an expected reduction in menorrhagia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3921310>Absorption of an oral contraceptive gestagen in ulcerative colitis before and after proctocolectomy and construction of a continent ileostomy.</a></h2><p>Plasma 1-norgestrel (1-Ng) levels after administration of a common oral contraceptive in fertile women (mean age 29 +/- 5 yrs) with mild ulcerative colitis before or after proctocolectomy with a conventional ileostomy or a continent ileostomy reservoir were determined and compared to those of a group of healthy volunteers serving as controls. Before operation, peak and 10-hour levels of 1-Ng were not statistically different from control. Levels in patients with either type of ileostomy were slightly lower than controls, but were only statistically significantly lower in patients with continent ileostomy (p less than 0.05). In a subgroup of patients studied both before and after proctocolectomy with construction of a continent ileostomy, there was a slight reduction in peak and 10-hour levels compared to control. After administration of the pill directly into the reservoir, significant levels of 1-Ng in plasma were found with peak and 10-hour levels approximately one-half of those achieved after oral administration. Although the material is small, it suggests that patients with mild ulcerative colitis and with small ileal resections (8.8 +/- 8 cm) can use combined contraceptive pills containing 1-norgestrel with confidence. Caution should be exercised, however, in prescribing "mini-pills" to patients after proctocolectomy and ileal resection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29050708>Hypercupremia secondary to oral contraceptives: report of 2 cases.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20434405>Contraceptive options for women in selected circumstances.</a></h2><p>Young women under the age of 16 years require special consideration when requesting contraception. Such young women can give voluntary consent, which enables prescription and supply providing that the practitioner has determined that the minor is sufficiently mature to understand the details of the method and its use. All reversible methods may be appropriate but it is necessary to provide information in a form that is fully understood. For women with pre-existing medical conditions including , the benefits and risks of the use of individual methods needs to be weighed against the risks of pregnancy for that woman.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Hormonal contraceptives are safe for women with IBD and frequently used for reproductive planning, but data are lacking on their effect on IBD-related symptoms.We completed a cross-sectional phone survey of 129 women (31% response rate), aged 18 to 45 years, with IBD in an academic practice between March and November 2013. An electronic database query identified eligible women, and we sent an opt-out letter before contact. Questions included demographics, medical and reproductive history, and current/previous contraceptive use. Women were asked if/how their menses affected IBD-related symptoms and if/how their contraceptive affected symptoms. We calculated descriptive statistics and made comparisons by Crohn's  versus ulcerative colitis on Stata V11.Participants were predominately white (85%) and college educated (97%), with a mean age of 34.2 (SD 6.2, range 19-45) years. Sixty percent had Crohn's , and 30% had IBD-related surgery previously. Half of the participants were parous, and 57% desired future pregnancy. Of the participants, 88% reported current or past hormonal contraceptive use and 60% noted cyclical IBD symptoms. Symptomatic improvement in cyclical IBD symptoms was reported by 19% of estrogen-based contraceptive users and 47% of  intrauterine device users. Only 5% of all hormonal method users reported symptomatic worsening.In a subset of women with IBD, 20% of hormonal contraception users reported improved cyclical menstrual-related IBD symptoms. Health care providers should consider potential noncontraceptive benefits of hormonal contraception in women with cyclical IBD symptoms.</p></html>
