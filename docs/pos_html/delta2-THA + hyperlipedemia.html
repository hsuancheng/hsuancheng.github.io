EC refers to "the fraction of potential health gain that is actually delivered to the population through the health system, given its capacity," and is used to indicate the percentage of the population whose diseases are well controlled among those who require treatment or are receiving treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of occupational health services on EC. We hypothesized that occupational health services provided to employees by full-time occupational health practitioners, such as occupational physicians and occupational health nurses, improve EC for hypertension, diabetes mellitus and  compared to those services provided by part-time occupational health practitioners. We conducted a cross-sectional study to analyze the results of general medical examinations, personnel information, and medical expense claims in fiscal year 2011. A total of 91,351 male employees at a company group participated in the study. The EC for hypertension, diabetes mellitus and  was measured and compared between the employees in workplaces with occupational health practitioners (OH group) and the employees in workplaces without occupational health practitioners (non-OH group). The EC for hypertension and diabetes mellitus was significantly greater in the OH group than in the non-OH group (aOR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.20 - 1.66 for hypertension; aOR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.17 - 2.00 for diabetes mellitus), while the EC for  was comparable (aOR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.92 - 1.34). Occupational health services provided by full-time occupational health practitioners greatly improve health management after a medical examination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579461>The impact of cigarette smoking on infarct location and in-hospital outcome following acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction.</a></h2><p> Smoking, which is a major modifiable risk factor for coronary artery diseases, affects cardiovascular system with different mechanisms. We designed this study to investigate the association of smoking with location of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and short-term outcomes during hospitalization.  In 1017 consecutive patients with anterior/inferior STEMI, comprehensive demographic, biochemical data, as well as clinical complications and mortality rate, were recorded. Patients were allocated into two groups based on smoking status and compared regarding the location of myocardial infarction, the emergence of clinical complications and in-hospital mortality in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Among 1017 patients, 300 patients (29.5%) were smoker and 717 patients (70.5 %) were non-smoker. Smokers were significantly younger and had lower prevalence of diabetes,  and hypertension. Inferior myocardial infarction was considerably more common in smokers than in non-smokers (45.7% vs. 36%,  = 0.001). Heart failure was developed more commonly in non-smokers (33.9% vs. 20%,  = 0.001). In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in smokers (6.7% vs. 17.3%,  = 0.001). After adjustment for confounding variables, smoking was independently associated with inferior myocardial infarction and lower heart failure [odds ratio: 1.44 (1.06-1.96),  = 0.01 and odds ratio: 0.61 (0.40-0.92),  = 0.02, respectively]. However, in-hospital mortality was not associated with smoking after adjustment for other factors [odds ratio: 0.69 (0.36-1.31),  = 0.2].  Smoking is independently associated with inferior myocardial infarction. Although smokers had lower incidence of heart failure, in-hospital mortality was not different after adjustment for other factors.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643751>Colestipol.</a></h2><p>Colestipol is a nonabsorbed bile acid sequestrant that is used a therapy of  and for the pruritus of chronic liver disease and biliary obstruction.

A number of vasoactive mediators including proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), endothelin-1, nitric oxide, and angiotensin II have fundamental roles in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic events; moreover, their levels are affected by dyslipidemia and oxidative stress due to renal dysfunction. Therefore, therapeutic measures aimed at correcting dyslipidemia and alleviating oxidative stress could potentially protect against CVD in CKD patients.

Hypercholesterolaemia, a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the general population, occurs in 75%-95% of individuals with PBC. The impact of hypercholesterolaemia on cardiovascular risk in PBC, however, is controversial. Previous data have shown that hypercholesterolaemia in PBC is not always associated with an increase in cardiovascular events. However, patients with PBC with cardiovascular risk factors may still warrant cholesterol-lowering therapy. Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in PBC poses unique challenges among primary care providers due to concerns of hepatotoxicity associated with cholesterol-lowering medications. This review summarises the current understanding of the pathophysiology of hypercholesterolaemia in PBC and its pertinent cardiovascular risk. We will also discuss indications for treatment and the efficacy and safety of available agents for hypercholesterolaemia in PBC.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Probiotic administration has been suggested as a safe therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. This study was designed to assess the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum 296, a fruit-derived bacteria strain, against cardiometabolic disorders induced by HF diet.Male Wistar rats were divided into control diet (CTL); HF diet; and HF diet treated with Lactobacillus fermentum 296 (HF + Lf 296). The L. fermentum 296 strain at 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml were daily administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. The results showed that rats fed with HF diet displayed insulin resistance, reduced Lactobacillus spp. counts in feces, serum lipids, and oxidative profile. Rats fed on HF diet also demonstrated augmented blood pressure associated with sympathetic hyperactivity and impaired baroreflex control. The administration of L. fermentum 296 for 4 weeks recovered fecal Lactobacillus sp. counts and alleviated , sympathetic hyperactivity, and reduced systolic blood pressure in HF rats without affecting baroreflex sensibility.Our results suggest the ability of L. fermentum 296 improve biochemical and cardiovascular parameters altered in cardiometabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

We examined atherogenesis in the left carotid artery with and without interrupted blood flow of C57BL/6 (B6) and C3H-Apoe-deficient (Apoe-/-) mouse strains.Blood flow was interrupted by ligating the common carotid artery near its bifurcation in one group of mice and another group was not interrupted.Without interference with blood flow, C3H-Apoe-/- mice developed no atherosclerosis in the carotid artery, while B6-Apoe-/- mice formed advanced atherosclerotic lesions (98,019 ± 10,594 μm2/section) after 12 weeks of a Western diet. When blood flow was interrupted by ligating the common carotid artery near its bifurcation, C3H-Apoe-/- mice showed fatty streak lesions 2 weeks after ligation, and by 4 weeks fibrous lesions had formed, although they were smaller than in B6-Apoe-/- mice. Neutrophil adhesion to endothelium and infiltration in lesions was observed in ligated arteries of both strains. Treatment of B6-Apoe-/- mice with antibody against neutrophils had little effect on lesion size.These findings demonstrate the dramatic influences of genetic backgrounds and blood flow on atherogenesis in the carotid artery of hyperlipidemic mice.© 2019 S.

However, the elderly have been underrepresented or excluded in these trials. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and safety of mechanical thrombectomy in patients with AIS aged 90 years or greater.A retrospective review of patients age 90 years or older presenting with AIS who underwent mechanical thrombectomy between 2010 and 2018.Of total 453 patients with AIS, 5.74 % (26) were aged 90 or older, and 69.32 % (314) ranged from 60-89 years of age. Of all baseline characteristics between both groups, there is a significant difference in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking,  (HLD), atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus. The mean NIHSS upon admission was higher in the nonagenarians (17 vs. 15). Similar proportions of both groups received tPA (57.69%, 15 vs. 42.68%, 134, p=0.14). There was no difference in peri & post-procedural complications, good TICI score (88.46%, 23 vs. 87.58%, 275, p=1.00), "good" mRS scores (34.62%, 4 vs. 49.36%, 155, p=0.40), and mortality (11.54%, 3 vs. 13.06%, 41, p= 0.82).Age is one of the factors that affect functional outcome following mechanical thrombectomy. Advancements in catheter techniques, technical experience, and great outcomes with mechanical thrombectomy allow for pushing the envelope to deal with age as one of the factors, rather, than an exclusion criterion.

Statins effectively combat hypercholesterolemia but are not well tolerated at high doses, raising the need for coprescription with cholesterol sorbents and/or absorption inhibitors. Montmorillonite (MMT) clay was found to attenuate hypercholesterolemia and obesity by reducing cholesterol and fat absorption. However, acicular clay-like sepiolite may offer better results due to its more substantial adsorption of nonpolar molecules. We herein aimed at (1) assessing  the capacity of sepiolite to adsorb edible oil and cholesterol compared with that of MMT and (2) assessing  the effect of continuous feeding on a high-fat high-cholesterol diet (HFD) (53.6% w/w fat and 0.2% cholesterol) supplemented with 5% (w/w) edible sepiolite, on diet-induced obesity rate, hypercholesterolemia, and . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed  that sepiolite adsorption of olive oil and cholesterol was five to eight times greater than that of MMT clay. Sepiolite supplementation to HFD fed to mature mice for 12.5 weeks resulted in lower total blood cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels and attenuated body weight gain, by reducing fat gain. Sepiolite supplementation did not affect energy intake but increased fecal extraction of sterols and lipids, without notable side effects. These results demonstrate that supplementing a HFD with sepiolite attenuates gastrointestinal absorption of dietary lipids and sterols, thus mitigating obesity, , and hypercholesterolemia. Further exploration of the efficacy, mechanism of action, and safety of sepiolite as a food supplement for combating the metabolic syndrome is needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581697>Antidiabetic and Antihyperlipidemic Effects of Sulphurenic Acid, a Triterpenoid Compound from , in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Mice.</a></h2><p>The present study was designed to evaluate the protective effect of sulphurenic acid (SA), a pure compound from , on diabetes and  in an animal model study and to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism. Diabetes was induced by daily 55 mg/kg intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (STZ) solution over five days. Diabetic mice were randomly divided into six groups and orally gavaged with SA (at three dosages) or glibenclamide (Glib), fenofibrate (Feno) or vehicle for 3 weeks. Our findings showed that STZ-induced diabetic mice had significantly increased fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1), plasma triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) levels ( < 0.001,  < 0.001,  < 0.001, and  < 0.05, respectively) but decreased blood insulin, adiponectin, and leptin levels compared to those of the control group ( < 0.001,  < 0.001, and  < 0.001, respectively). Administration of SA to STZ-induced diabetic mice may lower blood glucose but it increased the insulin levels with restoration of the size of the islets of Langerhans cells, implying that SA protected against STZ-induced diabetic states within the pancreas. At the molecular level, SA treatment exerts an increase in skeletal muscle expression levels of membrane glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and phospho-Akt to increase the membrane glucose uptake, but the mRNA levels of PEPCK and G6Pase are decreased to inhibit hepatic glucose production, thus leading to its hypoglycemic effect. Moreover, SA may cause hypolipidemic effects not only by enhancing hepatic expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) with increased fatty acid oxidation but also by reducing lipogenic fatty acid synthase (FAS) as well as reducing mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)1 and SREBP2 to lower blood TG and TC levels.

Although relatively weak, its activity at the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is particularly intriguing as guggulsterone acts as an antagonist with a peculiar ability of gene selective modulation. We report here a chemical biology study with the aim to further characterize the biological action of guggulsterone at the FXR and to obtain further insights into the functional role played by noncanonical FXR binding pockets S2 and S3. Our results suggest that the FXR accessory pockets might act as potential targets for small molecules able to modulate the metabolic activation of the receptor without affecting the anti-inflammatory activity thus revealing a new approach for disclosing selective FXR modulators that might bypass potential side-effects from chronic treatments.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585432>Expansive carotid artery remodeling: possible marker of vulnerable plaque.</a></h2><p>Accumulated findings in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis have demonstrated that not only luminal narrowing but also plaque characteristics influence the risk of future ischemic events. The morphology of the carotid artery (CA) changes in response to atherosclerotic development by expansive remodeling (ER), the clinical significance of which remains unclear. This study aimed to define associations between ER and local risk factors, including CA geometry and traditional systemic risk factors for ischemic events, to determine whether ER could serve as a clinical marker of carotid vulnerable plaque.The authors retrospectively analyzed 66 patients with CA stenosis who were scheduled to undergo carotid endarterectomy or CA stenting. They calculated ER ratios in the internal CA (ICA) from long-axis MR images and as the maximal distance between the lumen and the outer borders of the plaque perpendicular to the axis of the ICA/the maximal luminal diameter of the distal ICA at a region unaffected by atherosclerosis. Relative overall signal intensity (roSI) was calculated to assess intraplaque hemorrhage and defined as the signal intensity of plaque on an axial T1-weighted image with maximal stenosis relative to that of the adjacent sternocleidomastoid muscle. The authors evaluated CA geometry by calculating the angles between the common CA (CCA) and ICA, and between the CCA and external CA (ECA) using digital subtraction angiography. The ER ratios, age, sex, percentage of stenosis, roSI, hypertension, , low-density lipoprotein, statin medication, diabetes, smoking habit, and ischemic heart disease were compared between 33 symptomatic and 33 asymptomatic patients. The authors also compared symptomatic status, age, sex, percentage of stenosis, ICA angle, ECA angle, roSI, and other traditional atherosclerotic risk factors between groups with extensive and slight ER.The ER ratio was significantly greater in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients (1.91 ± 0.46 vs 1.68 ± 0.40, p < 0.05). The ICA angle was significantly larger in the group with extensive ER than in those with slight ER (33.9° ± 20.2° vs 21.7° ± 13.8°, p < 0.01). The roSI, ECA angle, percentage stenosis, or any other traditional vascular risk factors were not associated with ER.Carotid ER might be an independent indicator of carotid vulnerable plaque, which should be validated in a longitudinal study of patients with carotid atherosclerosis, including those with nonstenotic to moderate stenosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525874>Xanthohumol Suppresses NPC1L1 Gene Expression through Downregulation of HNF-4α and Inhibits Cholesterol Uptake in Caco-2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Xanthohumol (Xan) is a prenylated chalcone mainly found in hops; it has been demonstrated to function against hypercholesterolemia, , and atherosclerosis. In this study, we focused on the hypocholesterolemic effect of Xan on cholesterol uptake and the underlying molecular mechanisms of Xan in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. The microarray data showed that Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), an essential transporter for dietary cholesterol absorption, was significantly downregulated in Xan-treated Caco-2 cells. We demonstrated that Xan (10 and 20 μM) suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of NPC1L1 by 0.65 ± 0.12-fold and 0.54 ± 0.15-fold and 0.72 ± 0.04-fold and 0.44 ± 0.12-fold, respectively, compared to that of the vehicle-treated Caco-2 cells. Moreover, Xan (10 and 20 μM) significantly inhibited cholesterol uptake by approximately 12 and 32% in Caco-2 cells. NPC1L1 promoter activity was significantly suppressed by Xan, and a DNA element within the NPC1L1 promoter involved in Xan-mediated NPC1L1 reduction located between the -120 and -20 positions was identified. Moreover, Xan markedly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α), a critical activator of NPC1L1 transcription, and subsequently attenuated HNF-4α/NPC1L1 promoter complex formation, resulting in the suppression of NPC1L1 gene expression. Finally, we demonstrated that Xan markedly abolished lovastatin-induced NPC1L1 overexpression in Caco-2 cells. These findings reveal that Xan suppresses NPC1L1 expression via downregulation of HNF-4α and exerts inhibitory effects on cholesterol uptake in the intestinal Caco-2 cells. Our findings suggest Xan could serve as a potential cholesterol-lowering agent and supplement for statin therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618540>20-Year Follow-up of Statins in Children with Familial Hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by severely elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and premature cardiovascular disease. The short-term efficacy of statin therapy in children is well established, but longer follow-up studies evaluating changes in the risk of cardiovascular disease are scarce.We report a 20-year follow-up study of statin therapy in children. A total of 214 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (genetically confirmed in 98% of the patients), who were previously participants in a placebo-controlled trial evaluating the 2-year efficacy and safety of pravastatin, were invited for follow-up, together with their 95 unaffected siblings. Participants completed a questionnaire, provided blood samples, and underwent measurements of carotid intima-media thickness. The incidence of cardiovascular disease among the patients with familial hypercholesterolemia was compared with that among their 156 affected parents.Of the original cohort, 184 of 214 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (86%) and 77 of 95 siblings (81%) were seen in follow-up; among the 214 patients, data on cardiovascular events and on death from cardiovascular causes were available for 203 (95%) and 214 (100%), respectively. The mean LDL cholesterol level in the patients had decreased from 237.3 to 160.7 mg per deciliter (from 6.13 to 4.16 mmol per liter) - a decrease of 32% from the baseline level; treatment goals (LDL cholesterol <100 mg per deciliter [2.59 mmol per liter]) were achieved in 37 patients (20%). Mean progression of carotid intima-media thickness over the entire follow-up period was 0.0056 mm per year in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and 0.0057 mm per year in siblings (mean difference adjusted for sex, -0.0001 mm per year; 95% confidence interval, -0.0010 to 0.0008). The cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events and of death from cardiovascular causes at 39 years of age was lower among the patients with familial hypercholesterolemia than among their affected parents (1% vs. 26% and 0% vs. 7%, respectively).In this study, initiation of statin therapy during childhood in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia slowed the progression of carotid intima-media thickness and reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood.

Guggulsterone (GS) is a plant sterol used for treatment of various ailments such as obesity, , diabetes, and arthritis. In the current study, anti-cancer effects of GS in human colorectal cancer cell line HCT 116 was tested, potential targets identified using mass spectrometry-based label-free shotgun proteomics approach and key pathways validated by proteome profiler antibody arrays. Comprehensive proteomic profiling identified 14 proteins as significantly dysregulated. Proteins involved in cell proliferation/migration, tumorigenesis, cell growth, metabolism, and DNA replication were downregulated while the protein with functional role in exocytosis/tumor suppression was found to be upregulated. Our study evidenced that GS treatment altered expression of Bcl-2 mediated the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c which triggered the formation of apoptosome as well as activation of caspase-3/7 leading to death of HCT 116 cells via intrinsic apoptosis pathway. GS treatment also induced expression of p53 protein while p21 expression was unaltered with no cell cycle arrest.

Oocyte maturation under these lipotoxic conditions results in increased oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced developmental competence and disappointing IVF results.A well-described bovine oocyte IVM model was used, where a pathophysiologically relevant elevated FF concentrations of palmitic acid (PA; 150 μM or 300 μM) were added to induce oxidative stress. After fertilization (Day 0, D0), zygotes were in vitro cultured (IVC, from D1 to D8) in standard fatty acid-free media in the presence or absence of Mitoquinone or its carrier triphenyl-phosphonium.Embryo cleavage and fragmentation (D2) and blastocyst rates (D8) were recorded. Mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in cleaved embryos at D2 were determined using specific fluorogenic probes and confocal microscopy. D8 blastocysts were used to (i) examine the expression of marker genes related to mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPRmt; HSPD1 and HSPE1), mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) UPR (ATF4, ATF6 and BiP) and oxidative stress (CAT, GPX1 and SOD2) using real time RT-PCR; (ii) determine cell differentiation and apoptosis using CDX-2 and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining; and (iii) measure mtDNA copy numbers. This was tested in a series of experiments with at least three independent replicates for each, using a total of 2525 oocytes. Differences were considered significant if a P value was <0.05 after Bonferroni correction.Exposure to PA during IVM followed by culture under control conditions resulted in a significant increase in oxidative stress in embryos at D2. This was associated with a significant reduction in mitochondrial inner membrane potential (uncoupling) compared with solvent control (P < 0.05). The magnitude of these effects was PA-concentration dependent. Consequently, development to the blastocysts stage was significantly hampered. Surviving blastocysts exhibited high apoptotic cell indices and upregulated mRNA expression indicating persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial and ER UPRs. In contrast, supplementation of PA-derived zygotes with Mitoquinone during IVC (i) prevented mitochondrial uncoupling and alleviated oxidative stress at D2; and (ii) rescued blastocyst quality; normalized oxidative stress and UPR related genes and apoptotic cell indices (P > 0.01 compared with solvent control). Mitoquinone also improved blastocyst rate in PA-exposed groups, an effect that was dependent on PA concentration.N/A.This is a fundamental study performed using a bovine in vitro model using PA-induced lipotoxicity during oocyte maturation. PA is the most predominant FFA in the FF that is known to induce lipotoxicity; however, in vivo maturation in patients suffering from maternal metabolic disorders involve more factors that cannot be represented in one model. Nevertheless, focusing on the carryover oxidative stress as a known key factor affecting developmental competence, and considering the novel beneficial rescuing effects of Mitoquinone shown here, we believe this model is of high biological relevance.Human oocytes collected for IVF treatments from patients with maternal metabolic disorders are vulnerable to lipotoxicity and oxidative stress during in vivo maturation. The results shown here suggest that mitochondrial targeted therapy, such as using Mitoquinone, during IVC may rescue the developmental competence and quality of these compromised oocytes. After further clinical trials, this may be a valuable approach to increase IVF success rates for infertile patients experiencing metabolic disorders.This study was financially supported by a BOF/KP grant number 34399, from the University of Antwerp, Belgium.

We postulated that Chinese women with PCOS would have higher risk of incident diabetes and cardiometabolic abnormalities than those without PCOS during long-term follow-up.One hundred ninety-nine Chinese women with PCOS diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria and with a mean age of 41.2 years (SD = 6.4) completed a follow-up evaluation after an average of 10.6 ± 1.3 years. Two hundred twenty-five women without PCOS (mean age: 54.1 ± 6.7 years) who underwent baseline and follow-up evaluation over the same period were used for comparison. Progression of glycaemic status of women both with and without PCOS was assessed by using 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) screening with the adoption of 2009 American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria. The frequency of impaired glucose regulation, hypertension, and  of women with PCOS at follow-up has increased from 31.7% (95% CI 25.2%-38.1%) to 47.2% (95% CI 40.3%-54.2%), 16.1% (95% CI 11.0%-21.2%) to 34.7% (95% CI 28.1%-41.3%), and 52.3% (95% CI 45.3%-59.2%) to 64.3% (95% CI 57.7%-71.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in follow-up women with PCOS is 26.1% (95% CI 20.0%-32.2%), almost double that in the cohort of women without PCOS (p < 0.001). Age-standardised incidence of diabetes among women with PCOS was 22.12 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 10.86-33.37) compared with the local female population incidence rate of 8.76 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.72-8.80) and 10.09 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 4.92-15.26, p < 0.001) for women without PCOS in our study. Incidence rate for women with PCOS aged 30-39 years was 20.56 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 12.57-31.87), which is approximately 10-fold higher than that of the age-matched general female population in Hong Kong (1.88 per 1,000 person-years, [95% CI 1.85-1.92]). The incidence rate of type 2 DM (T2DM) of both normal-weight and overweight women with PCOS was around double that of corresponding control groups (normal weight: 8.96 [95% CI 3.92-17.72] versus 4.86 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 2.13-9.62], p > 0.05; overweight/obese: 28.64 [95% CI 19.55-40.60] versus 14.1 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 8.20-22.76], p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified that baseline waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio [OR] = 1.71 [95% CI 1.08-2.69], p < 0.05) and elevated triglyceride (OR = 6.63 [95% CI 1.23-35.69], p < 0.05) are associated with the progression to T2DM in PCOS. Limitations of this study include moderate sample size with limited number of incident diabetes during follow-up period and potential selection bias.High risk of diabetes and increased cardiovascular disease risk factors among Chinese women with PCOS are highlighted in this long-term follow-up study. Diabetes onset was, on average, 10 years earlier among women with PCOS than in women without PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664919>The ratio of total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol and myocardial infarction in Women's health in the Lund area (WHILA): a 17-year follow-up cohort study.</a></h2><p>Identifying variables predictive of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in women is important. The use of the ratio of total cholesterol-to-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C) is often overlooked. The aim was to study TC/HDL-C in relation to later AMI, in a large sample of women, adjusted for age, educational status, smoking, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure, and neighbourhood socioeconomic status. The hypothesis was that increasing TC/HDL-C is associated with an increased risk of later AMI.From December 1995 to February 2000, 6147 women aged 50-59 years from the Womens' Health in Lund area (WHILA) study in southern Sweden underwent a physical examination, laboratory tests and filled in a questionnaire. The women were followed through national registers for incidence of AMI during a mean follow up of 17 years.An increasing TC/HDL-C showed a strong relationship with AMI, with the lowest hazard ratio (HR = 1) in women with a ratio of ≤3.5. The HR for AMI was 1.14 (95% CI: 0.73-1.78) for those with a ratio between 3.5 and 4.0; in those with a ratio between 4.0 and 5.0 the HR for AMI was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.00-2.13) and in those with a ratio > 5.0 the HR was 1.89 (95% CI 1.26-2.82), after adjusting for potential confounding factors.TC/HDL-C ratio is a powerful predictor of AMI in middle-aged women. The results indicate that this variable should be used in clinical practice and is important for early identification of individuals at risk of AMI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513269>Obesity, Neuroinflammation, and Reproductive Function.</a></h2><p>The increasing occurrence of obesity has become a significant public health concern. Individuals with obesity have higher prevalence of heart disease, stroke, osteoarthritis, diabetes, and reproductive disorders. Reproductive problems include menstrual irregularities, pregnancy complications, and infertility due to anovulation, in women, and lower testosterone and diminished sperm count, in men. In particular, women with obesity have reduced levels of both gonadotropin hormones, and, in obese men, lower testosterone is accompanied by diminished LH. Taken together, these findings indicate central dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, specifically at the level of the GnRH neuron function, which is the final brain output for the regulation of reproduction. Obesity is a state of hyperinsulinemia, , hyperleptinemia, and chronic inflammation. Herein, we review recent advances in our understanding of how these metabolic and immune changes affect hypothalamic function and regulation of GnRH neurons. In the latter part, we focus on neuroinflammation as a major consequence of obesity and discuss findings that reveal that GnRH neurons are uniquely positioned to respond to inflammatory changes.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568220>CYTOMEGALOVIRUS RETINITIS WITH BELATACEPT IMMUNOSUPPRESSION.</a></h2><p>To report two cases of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in renal transplant patients after conversion to belatacept immunosuppression.Case report.Case A was a 41-year-old African American man with no ocular history, chronic hepatitis B infection on entecavir, status-post living relative renal transplant for end-stage renal disease secondary to IgA nephropathy presented with a chief complaint of "blurry vision" in his right eye. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye revealed perivascular retinitis of the superior arcade extending temporally and a lesion nasal to the optic disk. The patient was diagnosed with CMV retinitis with macular involvement. Case B was a 52-year-old woman with an ocular history significant for bilateral vein occlusions treated with laser, and a medical history of hypertension, , and end-stage renal disease secondary to hypoplastic kidney status-post deceased donor renal transplant presented with one week of blurred vision in the right eye. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye revealed macular star configuration of exudates, as well as subretinal fibrosis temporal to the macula. Fundoscopic examination of the left eye showed Grade 4 vitreous haze and multiple areas of retinal whitening and hemorrhage, consistent with CMV retinitis infection. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral CMV retinitis, with macular involvement in the right eye.Renal transplant patients converted to belatacept immunosuppression may be at an increased risk for herpes virus infection, and thus herpes virus retinitis. Although the degree of risk remains uncharacterized, patients on belatacept therapy who are at the high risk of CMV infection (i.e., donor-positive/recipient-negative patients) should be counseled on the presenting signs and symptoms of CMV retinitis. In these cases, clinicians should also consider regular monitoring of serum CMV titers or continuation of antiviral prophylaxis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548127>Statin use increased new-onset diabetes in hypercholesterolemic individuals: Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort database (NHIS-HEALS).</a></h2><p>We investigated the association between statin use and new-onset diabetes (NODM) in Korean adults with hypercholesterolemia.This study performed based on data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort for the years from 2002 to 2015. Statin users classified as high- or low- users according to medication possession ratio. Statin non-users consisted of hypercholesterolemic participants who never used statin over the entire follow-up period. 21,469 participants (10,880 statin users, 10,589 statin non-users) with a median follow-up period of 12.5 years were included. We estimated the NODM risk based on the survival analyses. In particular, to adjust for confounding effects, we considered Cox proportional hazards regression models over three stages.Compared to non-users, statin users had a significantly higher risk for NODM. The fully adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) (95% confidential intervals [95% CIs]) of statin users for NODM were 1.43 (1.31-1.57) in men, and 1.86 (1.66-2.10) in women, respectively after adjusted confounding factors including age and lifestyle factors. Compared to high-users, aHRs (95% CIs) of low-users for NODM were 1.16 (1.03-1.30) and 1.28 (1.16-1.43) in men and women, respectively.In hypercholesterolemic patients, statin users have a higher risk of NODM than non-users.Copyright © 2019 Primary Care Diabetes Europe.

A retrospective observational cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>The Japanese government has developed and promoted a national nutrient-based dietary guideline for preventing lifestyle-related chronic disease. However, its impact in a real-life setting has never been evaluated. We performed a critical appraisal of the guideline by examining the association between adherence to the guideline and lifestyle-related outcome indicators.This is a retrospective observational cross-sectional study using nationally representative data on health and nutrition characteristics from the 2016 National Health and Nutrition Survey of Japan. We considered 3,861 participants aged ≥20 years, with evidence of low health risks of diabetes, hypertension, , and obesity. Five health outcome indicators (hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and body mass index), were employed. A summary score was developed to reflect adherence to the recommended intake of seven nutrients defined by the guideline, including proteins, fat, saturated fatty acid, carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sodium, and potassium. Multivariate quartile regression approaches were employed to examine the association between the adherence score and the health outcome indicators, adjusting for the covariates.Overall, the proportion of those who adhered to the guideline (adherence rate) for all seven nutrients was only 0.3%. There was considerable variation in the adherence rate between the different nutrients, from 24.2% to 61.8%. After adjustment for covariates, in most health outcome indicators, regardless of age category and quartile, there was no clear association between the guideline adherence score and indicators.There is plenty of scope for improving the guideline. Nutrient impact on health may not necessarily depend on the amount of each nutrient in the diet. The significance and contribution of synergies between nutrients and complex interactions within foods to health outcomes need to be explored in future guideline updates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643784>Resveratrol.</a></h2><p>Resveratrol is a plant polyphenol found in high concentrations in red grapes that has been proposed as a treatment for  and to prevent fatty liver, diabetes, atherosclerosis and aging.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of miR-1296 as a non-invasive biomarker in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Serum samples were collected from normal people and NAFLD patients for biochemical detection. Serum microRNAs were isolated by the NucleoZOL method, and the stem-loop method was used to reverse transcribe the DNA. The relative quantification of miR-1296 was performed by SYBR Green method. Spearman's method was used to analyze the correlation between miR-1296 and serum biochemical parameters.By using 2-∆∆CT method, we found that, compared with the normal control group, the expression of serum miR-1296 increased in patients with normal lipid NAFLD and those with  NAFLD. At the same time, the expression of microRNA-1296 in the NAFLD  group increased more significantly than that in the NFALD group with normal lipid. Spearman's correlation assay demonstrated that the correlation between the expression of miR-1296 and blood lipids, including TC, TG, HDL-c, and LDL-c, was TC (r = 0.4951, p = 0.0013), TG (r = 0.054, p = 0.6425), HDL-C (r = 0.3435, p = 0.07522), and LDL-C (r = 0.3307, p = 0.0699. The data showed that miR-1296 was positively correlated with serum TC level.In summary, serum microRNA-1296 is a more sensitive marker of NAFLD than blood lipids, which provides a new method for noninvasive early screening of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628482>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II, randomized study of lovastatin therapy in the treatment of mildly active rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibitors (statins) are standard treatment for . In addition to lipid-lowering abilities, statins exhibit multiple anti-inflammatory effects. The objectives of this study were to determine whether treatment of patients with RA with lovastatin decreased CRP or reduced disease activity.We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 12 week trial of lovastatin vs placebo in 64 RA patients with mild clinical disease activity but an elevated CRP. The primary efficacy end point was the reduction in mean log CRP. Secondary end points included disease activity, RF and anti-CCP antibody titres. Mechanistic end points included levels of serum cytokines. Safety was assessed; hepatic and muscle toxicities were of particular interest.Baseline features were similar between groups. No significant difference in mean log CRP reduction between the two groups was observed, and disease activity did not change from baseline in either treatment group. Mechanistic analyses did not reveal significant changes in any biomarkers. A post hoc analysis of subjects not using biologic therapy demonstrated a significantly greater proportion achieving ⩾20% reduction in CRP from baseline in the lovastatin group compared with placebo (P-value = 0.007). No difference was observed in subjects receiving biologics. Lovastatin was well tolerated with no serious safety concerns.This study showed no anti-inflammatory or clinical effects on RA disease activity after 12 weeks of treatment with lovastatin. Lovastatin had a modest effect on CRP in subjects not using biologics, suggesting statins may be anti-inflammatory in selected patients.ClinicalTrials.gov, http://clinicaltrials.gov, .© The Author(s) 2019.

Several studies have confirmed that obesity (OB),  (HL), or diabetes mellitus (DM) can increase severity, mortality, and complications in AP. However, there is no comprehensive information on the independent or joint effect of MetS components on the outcome of AP. Our aims were (1) to understand whether the components of MetS have an independent effect on the outcome of AP and (2) to examine the joint effect of their combinations.From 2012 to 2017, 1435 AP cases from 28 centers were included in the prospective AP Registry. Patient groups were formed retrospectively based on the presence of OB, HL, DM, and hypertension (HT). The primary endpoints were mortality, severity, complications of AP, and length of hospital stay. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.1257 patients (55.7 ± 17.0 years) were included in the analysis. The presence of OB was an independent predictive factor for renal failure [OR: 2.98 (CI: 1.33-6.66)] and obese patients spent a longer time in hospital compared to non-obese patients (12.1 vs. 10.4 days,  = 0.008). HT increased the risk of severe AP [OR: 3.41 (CI: 1.39-8.37)], renal failure [OR: 7.46 (CI: 1.61-34.49)], and the length of hospitalization (11.8 vs. 10.5 days,  = 0.020). HL increased the risk of local complications [OR: 1.51 (CI: 1.10-2.07)], renal failure [OR: 6.4 (CI: 1.93-21.17)], and the incidence of newly diagnosed DM [OR: 2.55 (CI: 1.26-5.19)]. No relation was found between the presence of DM and the outcome of AP. 906 cases (mean age ± : 56.9 ± 16.7 years) had data on all four components of MetS available. The presence of two, three, or four MetS factors increased the incidence of an unfavorable outcome compared to patients with no MetS factors.OB, HT, and HL are independent risk factors for a number of complications. HT is an independent risk factor for severity as well. Components of MetS strongly synergize each other's detrimental effect. It is important to search for and follow up on the components of MetS in AP.Copyright © 2019 Szentesi, Párniczky, Vincze, Bajor, Gódi, Sarlós, Gede, Izbéki, Halász, Márta, Dobszai, Török, Farkas, Papp, Varga, Hamvas, Novák, Mickevicius, Maldonado, Sallinen, Illés, Kui, Erőss, Czakó, Takács and Hegyi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604801>Insulin activates intracellular transport of lipid droplets to release triglycerides from the liver.</a></h2><p>Triglyceride-rich lipid droplets (LDs) are catabolized with high efficiency in hepatocytes to supply fatty acids for producing lipoprotein particles. Fasting causes a massive influx of adipose-derived fatty acids into the liver. The liver in the fasted state is therefore bloated with LDs but, remarkably, still continues to secrete triglycerides at a constant rate. Here we show that insulin signaling elevates phosphatidic acid (PA) dramatically on LDs in the fed state. PA then signals to recruit kinesin-1 motors, which transport LDs to the peripherally located smooth ER inside hepatocytes, where LDs are catabolized to produce lipoproteins. This pathway is down-regulated homeostatically when fasting causes insulin levels to drop, thus preventing dangerous elevation of triglycerides in the blood. Further, we show that a specific peptide against kinesin-1 blocks triglyceride secretion without any apparent deleterious effects on cells. Our work therefore reveals fundamental mechanisms that maintain lipid homeostasis across metabolic states and leverages this knowledge to propose a molecular target against .© 2019 Kumar et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511532>Genome-wide association meta-analyses and fine-mapping elucidate pathways influencing albuminuria.</a></h2><p>Increased levels of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) are associated with higher risk of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events, but underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood.

Atorvastatin is an effective drug for treating  and known to improve neurological outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage. Previous studies have reported that atorvastatin treatment promotes hematoma absorption in CSDH, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin mediate absorption of CSDH. 144 male, Wistar rats (6 months old) were randomly divided into the following groups: 1) sham surgery control, 2) treatment: CSDH + atorvastatin, and 3) vehicle control: CSDH + saline. Atorvastatin or saline was orally administered daily for 19 days after CSDH procedure. A T2WI MRI was used to evaluate CSDH volume changes during the time course of the study. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining were used to measure the number of regulatory T cells (Treg). ELISA was used to measure cytokine level in the hematoma border. Neurological function and cognitive outcome were evaluated using Foot-Fault test and Morris Water Maze test, respectively. When compared to saline treatment, atorvastatin treatment accelerated the absorption of CSDH as indicated by decreased hematoma volume in T2WI MRI data on 14 and 21 day after CSDH (P<0.05). Atorvastatin treatment significantly increased the number of Treg in circulation and hematoma border from 3 to 21 day after CSDH. Atorvastatin treatment significantly decreased the levels of interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), but increased IL-10 level in the hematoma border. Atorvastatin treatment also improved neurological function and cognitive outcome compared to vehicle treated group. Atorvastatin induced anti-inflammatory responses and increased Treg in circulation and brain which may contribute to the accelerated CSDH absorption in rats.Copyright: © 2019 Quan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493727>Screening mammography beyond breast cancer: breast arterial calcifications as a sex-specific biomarker of cardiovascular risk.</a></h2><p>To highlight the importance of quantitative breast arterial calcifications (BAC) assessment for an effective stratification of cardiovascular (CV) risk in women, for whom current preventive strategies are inadequate. BAC, easily detectable on mammograms, are associated with CV disease and represent a potential imaging biomarker for CV disease prevention in women.We summarized the available evidence on this topic.Age, parity, diabetes, and  were found to positively correlate with BAC. Women with BAC have a higher CV risk than those without BAC: the relative risk was reported to be 1.4 for transient ischemic attack/stroke, 1.5 for thrombosis, 1.8 for myocardial infarction; the reported hazard ratio was 1.32 for coronary artery disease (CAD), 1.52 for heart failure, 1.29 for CV death, 1.44 for death from CAD. However, BAC do not alarm radiologists; when reported, they are commonly mentioned as "present", not impacting on CV decision-making. Of 18 published studies, 9 reported only presence/absence of BAC, 4 used a semi-quantitative scale, and 5 a continuous scale (with manual, automatic or semiautomatic segmentation). Various appearance, topological complexity, and vessels overlap make BAC quantification difficult to standardize. Nevertheless, machine learning approaches showed promising results in BAC quantification on mammograms.There is a strong rationale for mammography to become a dual test for breast cancer screening and CV disease prevention. However, robust and automated quantification methods are needed for a deeper insight on the association between BAC and CV disease, to stratifying CV risk and define personalized preventive actions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Early procedures were associated with significant morbidity and mortality and were performed in very low numbers in select patients.This study includes all recipients of an SPK at the University of Wisconsin-Madison between 1986 and 1993 who were actively followed and had a functional pancreas allograft for more than 25 years as of 10/31/2018.A total of 291 SPK were performed during the study period; of these, 39 patients still had a functional graft at last follow up and nine (18.8%) pancreas grafts were lost due to patient death or graft failure after more than 25 years. At last follow up, all 39 patients with functional pancreas graft had at least one co-morbidity, such as hypertension, , or coronary artery disease. Twenty-seven required enteric conversion; 11 patients experienced renal allograft failure (10 underwent a repeat kidney transplant); and 6 required amputation of part of the lower extremity. In the Cox regression analysis, bladder drained pancreas was associated with lower probability of prolonged pancreas graft survival (HR: 0.52; CI: 0.32 to 0.85; p=0.01).With careful and detailed follow-up and attention to complications, some recipients of pancreas grafts have outstanding outcomes.

However, the prognostic significance of troponin elevation following coronary intervention is still debated.Patient-level data from 5 contemporary coronary stent trials and 1 large registry were pooled. Mortality of patients with stable angina, with normal baseline biomarkers, was compared between patients with and those without different cutoff values of cTn and CK-MB.A total of 13,452 patients were included in this pooled analysis. The overall percentage of patients with elevated biomarkers following PCI was 23.9% for CK-MB and 68.4% for cTn. In the patient cohort for whom both assays were available (n = 8,859), 2.4% had both CK-MB ≥5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) and cTn ≥35 × ULN, while 92% had both CK-MB <5 × ULN and cTn <35 × ULN. Among patients with CK-MB ≥5 × ULN (n = 315), 212 (67.3%) also had cTn ≥35 × ULN. Conversely, 390 of patients (64.8%) who had cTn ≥35 × ULN did not have CK-MB ≥5 × ULN. A total of 259 patients (1.9%) died at 1 year; 20 (7.7%) had CK-MB ≥5 × ULN, and 23 (8.8%) had cTn ≥35 × ULN. In the Cox multivariate analysis, in which the CK-MB and cTn ratios post-procedure were forced into the model, age, prior myocardial infarction, lesion complexity, , and CK-MB ratio (≥10) post-procedure were associated with increased 1-year mortality.Following elective PCI in patients in stable condition treated with second-generation drug-eluting stent, CK-MB and cTn elevations remain common. After multivariate adjustment, there was an increased mortality rate with elevation of CK-MB after PCI, whereas cTn elevation was not independently associated with mortality at 1 year.Copyright © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Forty-five patients had microalbuminuria and 55 subjects were microalbuminuria negative. Endothelial measurements were obtained using specular microscopy. Endothelial cell density, average area, co-efficient of variation, maximum area, minimum area, hexagonality and corneal thickness were compared between the groups on the basis of microalbuminuria, DM duration and medication, HbA , body mass index, serum lipid and protein profiles, hypertension and  diagnosis.There were no significant differences in age, gender, endothelial cell density, average area, co-efficients of variation, maximum area, minimum area, hexagonality or corneal thickness among the microalbuminuria positive, microalbuminuria negative and control groups (p > 0.05). However, microalbuminuria positive patients had lower high-density lipoprotein levels than the microalbuminuria negative patients (p = 0.042). DM and control groups showed similar endothelial measurements (p > 0.05). Patients with a HbA > 7 per cent (53 mmol/mol) had lower hexagonality value (p = 0.039) than in the subjects with a HbA ≤ 7 per cent. No significant differences were found in endothelial parameters when groups were compared based on DM duration, medication and co-morbidities.Microalbuminuria positive and negative patients with DM without retinopathy seem to have similar corneal endothelial measurements with controls. However, patients with a HbA > 7 per cent should be monitored for deterioration in corneal endothelial cell morphology even without diabetic retinopathy, which might be critical prior to anterior segment surgery.© 2019 Optometry Australia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564580>Effects of Endovascular First strategy on spliced vein bypass outcomes.</a></h2><p>Aggressive endovascular interventions for patients without adequate full-length venous conduit have gained popularity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of spliced vein bypass (SVB) as primary treatment versus treatment after failed endovascular intervention (endovascular SVB [ESVB]) for infrainguinal revascularization.A retrospective analysis of a single vascular group's database of all SVBs was queried for demographics, indications, intraoperative details, and outcomes. Exclusion criteria included acute ischemia, aneurysm, dual outflow, bypass revisions, and patients lost to immediate follow-up. SPSS software was used for statistical analysis.Two hundred thirty-five infrainguinal SVBs were performed between January 2011 and March 2017. There were 182 SVB (77%) and 53 ESVB (23%) with a mean follow-up of 488 days (range, 1-2140). Demographics between the SVB and ESVB groups were similar in all categories recorded: diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, current smoker, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, , and renal disease (P = .29). Indications for bypass were not statistically significant between SVB and ESVB (P = .48). The study included Rutherford class 3 (14 vs 2), class 4 (51 vs 20), class 5 (67 vs 18), and class 6 (50 vs 13). Inflow was grouped into iliac (2.6%), femoral (88%), and popliteal (9.8%). Outflow arteries were grouped into below knee popliteal (14.9%) and infrapopliteal (85.1%). Inflow and outflow arteries, as well as number of spliced pieces per bypass were not different between groups. Major amputation rates were not different between SVB and ESVB for the entire study period. There was no statistical difference with patency outcomes based on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (P = .84).An aggressive endovascular first strategy for treatment of patients without adequate autogenous conduit seems to offer benefit without negatively affecting future bypass options. SVB patency and major amputation rates in this series were not affected by a prior endovascular treatment.Copyright © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Participants underwent standardised systemic and ocular examinations. RNFL thickness was obtained using a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT). RNFL symmetry (in %) was calculated based on Pearson correlation coefficient between the RNFL thickness profiles of the right and left eyes. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to investigate the associations between ocular and systemic factors with RNFL symmetry.4211 participants (1227 Chinese, 1245 Malays, 1739 Indians) were included. The mean RNFL symmetry was 86.7%±8.5% in Chinese, 84.7%±10.2% in Malays and 84.0%±10.7% in Indians. The fifth percentile limit of RNFL symmetry was 71.2% in Chinese, 65.0% in Malays and 62.0% in Indians. In multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, , intereye absolute differences in intraocular pressure (IOP), axial length and disc area, Malays (β=-0.9; p=0.03) and Indians (β=-1.76; p<0.001) were found to have lower RNFL symmetry compared with Chinese. Older age, greater intereye differences in IOP, axial length and disc area were significantly associated with lower RNFL symmetry (all p≤0.003).In non-glaucoma individuals, intereye RNFL profile is less symmetric in Malays and Indians than that in Chinese. This also suggests that current commercial optical coherence tomography's deployment of a single, universal RNFL symmetry cut-off for glaucoma detection is flawed, and ethnic-specific cut-off is warranted.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

FH risks can be minimized through regular participation in three self-management. BEHAVIORS: physical activity, healthy eating, and taking cholesterol lowering medication.The present study tested the effectiveness of an integrated social cognition model in predicting intention to participate in the self-management behaviors in FH patients from seven countries.Consecutive patients in FH clinics from Australia, Hong Kong, Brazil, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, and UK (total N = 726) completed measures of social cognitive beliefs about illness from the common sense model of self-regulation, beliefs about behaviors from the theory of planned behavior, and past behavior for the three self-management behaviors.Structural equation models indicated that beliefs about behaviors from the theory of planned behavior, namely, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, were consistent predictors of intention across samples and behaviors. By comparison, effects of beliefs about illness from the common sense model were smaller and trivial in size. Beliefs partially mediated past behavior effects on intention, although indirect effects of past behavior on intention were larger for physical activity relative to taking medication and healthy eating. Model constructs did not fully account for past behavior effects on intentions. Variability in the strength of the beliefs about behaviors was observed across samples and behaviors.Current findings outline the importance of beliefs about behaviors as predictors of FH self-management behaviors. Variability in the relative contribution of the beliefs across samples and behaviors highlights the imperative of identifying sample- and behavior-specific correlates of FH self-management behaviors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted a 5 years prospective study. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning. Carotid computed tomography angiography (CTA) was conducted using a 64-multidetector row scanner to assess carotid arterial plaque at baseline and during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to evaluate the association of BMD and risk of carotid calcification plaques.  Four hundred and eighty-eight women sustained prospective carotid plaques during the follow-up. Women with carotid calcification plaques had low BMD than those with carotid non-calcification plaques. After adjustment for potential confounders, BMD, age, years since menopause, levels of plasma osteoprotegerin and adiponectin, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and  were independently associated with increased risk of carotid calcification plaques. For carotid calcification plaques, a significant inverse correlation was indicated between BMD and the plaques, and a significant positive correlation was indicated between bone loss and plaques.

It has recently been established that psoriasis is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. Chronic skin-specific inflammation may promote atherosclerosis. Myocardial infarction or stroke can also be a result of underlying haemostasis disorders. Disorders in fibrinolysis and thrombosis in patients with psoriasis have been observed by many authors.This study points to the key role played by the tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation and the potential influence of microvascular disorders in inflamed psoriatic skin on TF and TFPI activity.The study included 47 patients with active psoriasis vulgaris, hospitalized in the Dermatological Ward of the Regional Specialist Hospital, Research and Development Centre in Wroclaw, as well as 18 people from the control group.There were significant differences in the blood concentrations of TF and TFPI in patients with psoriasis when compared to the control group. A low TFPI concentration in psoriatic patients may indicate an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Interpretation of a decreased level of TF in patients with psoriasis is difficult because it seems to be at odds with observations among patients with other atherosclerosis risk factors such as hypertension, , diabetes or smoking.It appears that further studies are necessary to explain this problem, perhaps to include an evaluation of TF levels in psoriatic skin.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624042>Design, synthesis and evaluation of 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione-Based fibrates as potential hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective agents.</a></h2><p>Six novel target compounds 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (ADT) based fibrates were synthesized and evaluated.

This report describes the discovery of NPC1L1, its transport properties, and the inhibitory effects of polyphenols on NPC1L1. NPC1L1 was identified in 2004 while searching for ezetimibe molecular targets. Excessive synthesis of cholesterol results in , which increases the amount of bile cholesterol excreted into the duodenum. The inhibition of NPC1L1 decreases blood cholesterol because food and bile cholesterol are also absorbed from NPC1L1 in the intestine. Some polyphenols, particularly luteolin, have been reported as NPC1L1-mediated anti-dyslipidemia constituents. Luteolin affects NPC1L1 through two mechanisms. Luteolin directly inhibits NPC1L1 by binding to it, which occurs in a short timeframe similar to that for ezetimibe. The other mechanism is the inhibition of NPC1L1 expression. Luteolin reduced the binding of Sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) in the promoter region of the  gene and decreased mRNA levels of  and . These data suggest that luteolin decreases the expression of NPC1L1 through regulation of transcription factors.

The presumed TNA cause was categorized as transient ischemic attack (TIA), ROSD, and other cause. Baseline characteristics, triggers, cardiovascular complications within 90 days, and death were recorded.The prevalence of ROSD in the studied cohort was 10% (34/340). Infectious stressors and acute metabolite derangements were more common in ROSD compared to TIA ( < .05, each). Compared to TIA and the other TNA, ROSD was more likely to have more than 1 acute stressor ( < .001). Patients with ROSD had similar vascular risk factors compared to TIA ( > .05), including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, , and similarly used HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, antihypertensive, and antiplatelet medications. Among the patients with an available 90-day follow-up (n = 233), cardiovascular events were more frequent in the TIA group as compared to other TNA ( < .05).ROSD is common and distinct from TIA and is associated with a triggering physiologic reaction leading to transient reemergence of prior neurologic deficits.

The St. Joseph's/Candler Center for Medication Management (CMM) is a pharmacist-managed ambulatory care clinic that provides referral-based ambulatory care services in anticoagulation, diabetes, heart failure, tobacco cessation, transitional care, vaccinations, and wellness contracts for self-insured organizations, and has 147 referring physicians. Nurse Practitioners and Pharmacists evaluate and manage patients under their scope of practice and supervising medical director for the CMM. Pharmacists and Nurse Practitioners educate patients and collaborate with referring physicians for disease state management but do not carry prescriptive authority at CMM. CMM bills for services as a provider-based department of the hospital. CMM is recognized as an Anticoagulation Center of Excellence by the Anticoagulation Forum and is interventional with ambulatory care quality initiatives of the health system. Pharmacists in CMM are board-certified in ambulatory care provided by Board of Pharmacy Specialties and have completed a minimum of a 1-year post-graduate training program accredited by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. CMM has 4 off-campus satellite locations providing ambulatory care referral-based services. Since 2007, the CMM has primarily provided anticoagulation services via laboratory monitoring and management of warfarin.Pharmacists transitioned from provider-based departments of a hospital to outpatient primary care medical groups. This transition changed their job description and the model for reimbursement of the pharmacists' salaries. Four pharmacists were present 60 hours per week from January 2018 to August 2018, and 80 hours per week (2 full-time clinical pharmacist positions) from September 2018 to December 2018, to conduct AWVs and disease state management patient encounters. These pharmacists divided their time between a department of a hospital and a traditional medical group of the same health system.For calendar year 2018, 1770 AWVs and 468 disease state management patient care visits were provided exclusively by pharmacists to patients of the 4 primary care medical groups of this community practice health system. Patient visits for disease state management included diabetes, hypertension, , anticoagulation, and tobacco cessation.For the calendar year 2018, 1770 AWVs and 468 disease state management patient visits were provided exclusively by pharmacists, under the direct supervision of physician, to patients of primary care medical groups.This is an example of expanding direct patient care pharmacy services, within a health system, to primary care medical groups, without direct grant or university funding.Copyright © 2019.

Herein, the effects of recombinant BTI (rBTI) on fat accumulation in Caenorhabditis elegans were studied. rBTI prevented fat accumulation under normal and high glucose conditions, and led to significantly shorter body widths without affecting C. elegans feeding behavior. Results also indicate that rBTI altered fat breakdown, synthesis, and accumulation by altering the transcription, expression and activity of key enzymes in lipolysis and fat synthesis. In daf-2 and daf-16 mutants, rBTI did not prevent fat accumulation, indicating that rBTI activity relies on the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IIS) pathway. Overall rBTI may regulate changes in lipolysis and fat synthesis by down-regulating the IIS pathway, which can affect fat accumulation. These findings support the application of rBTI in preventing obesity, hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia.Copyright © 2018.

Platelet function is known to be altered under various inflammatory conditions including aging. A gain in platelet function during aging can increase the risk of thrombotic events, such as stroke and acute myocardial infarction. Anti-platelet therapy is designed to reduce risk of serious cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events, but the adverse consequences of therapy, such as risk for bleeding increases with aging as well. Age-associated comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and  also contribute to increased platelet activity and thus can enhance the risk of thrombosis. Therefore, identification of unique mechanisms of platelet dysfunction in aging and in age-associated comorbidities is warranted to design novel antiplatelet drugs.

Total cholesterol and fractions were analyzed and population prevalences of altered values according to socio-demographic variables were calculated. The cutoff points considered were: total cholesterol ≥ 200mg/dl; low-density lipoprotein LDL ≥ 130mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein HDL < 40mg/dL.The prevalence of total cholesterol ≥200mg/dL in the population was 32.7%, and higher in women (35.1%). The prevalence of altered HDL was 31.8%, 22.0% in females and 42.8% in males. LDL ≥ 130mg/dL was found in 18.6% and was higher in women (19.9%). The population aged 45 years old and older and those with low levels of education presented a higher prevalence of altered cholesterol.Altered values of total cholesterol and fractions were frequent in the Brazilian population, especially among women, the elderly and people with low levels of education.

A total of 213 consecutive patients were included in the study.Mean age was 61.5 ± 9.7 years and mean follow-up of all patients was 1.4 ± 0.5 years. All patients were divided into two groups as high and low MPV/PC ratio in terms of 3.825 of cut-off point. 72 patients had a high MPV/PC ratio, whereas, 141 patients had low MPV/PC ratio. The rates of reoperation for early vein-graft occlusion, low cardiac output syndrome and respiratory complication were significantly higher in group 1 (p = 0.03, 0.04 and 0.01). The mean hospital length of stay was higher in group 1 (p = 0.03). MPV/PC ratio for reoperation for early vein-graft occlusion; MPV and ejection fraction for low cardiac output syndrome; , chronic renal failure history and MPV/PC ratio for sepsis; male gender, CRF history and CPB time for atrial fibrillation; age, congestive heart failure history, myocardial infarction history and CPB time for the early mortality were found to be independent predictors. Peripheral arterial diseases, USAP and MPV/PC ratio were found to be independent predictors for the late mortality.A high MPV/PC ratio is associated with early vein-graft occlusion and poor postoperative outcomes in the early period after CABG.

This study intended to analyze the effects of hazelnut oil supplementation on the serum lipid profile and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in hamsters fed a high-cholesterol (HC) diet. : Hamsters were fed a basic diet (control group) and an HC diet (HC group) for 16 weeks ( = 10 in each group). Hamsters were fed an HC diet for four weeks to induce  and were then fed an HC diet enriched with 5% (low-dose HC + HO group;  = 10) and 10% HO (high-dose HC + HO group;  = 10) for 12 weeks. Serum lipid levels, hepatic changes (including steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis), and hepatic prooxidant-antioxidant status (malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST)) were evaluated after the treatment period. : Hamsters in the control group showed normal serum lipid profiles, normal liver function, and moderate glycogen storage without hepatic steatosis. Hamsters in the HC group showed severe , severe hepatic steatosis, and moderate steatohepatitis (mononuclear cell and neutrophil infiltration, oval cell hyperplasia, and fibrosis). Compared to the HC group, both the low-dose and the high-dose HC + HO groups showed a significant reduction of  (serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C levels)) and improved liver function (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)). Additionally, compared to the HC group, intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation (IHTC) was significantly higher in the HC + HO group, while the incidence of steatohepatitis was significantly lower. The intake of the HC diet was associated with a higher level of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) and a lower concentration of hepatic antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx, and GST), and all these factors were partially improved in the low-dose and high-dose HC + HO groups.  Our findings indicate that the intake of HO reduced serum  and oxidative stress and ameliorated the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in hamsters fed a high-cholesterol diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644539>Increased incidence of age-related macular degeneration in sensorineural hearing loss: A population-based cohort study.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in patients diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) via the application of the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan.A retrospective cohort study was conducted.

Consecutive patients admitted to the participating cardiology clinics who were at least 18 years of age and who had been classified in a secondary prevention (SP) group or a high-risk primary prevention (PP) group were enrolled. The study population included 1868 patients from 40 sites in Turkey. Two-thirds (67.5%) of the patients in the SP group had been prescribed a statin, whereas only 30.1% of the PP group patients received statin therapy (p<0.001).It was determined that 18% of the SP patients and 10.6% of the PP patients had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level at the recommended level (p<0.001). A patient survey revealed that almost half of the patients in the PP and in the SP groups were aware that their cholesterol levels were high.

Bone trabecula play a vital role in the severity and progression of ONFH. In the present study, the investigators used gene expression profiling of bone trabecula to investigate gene alterations in ONFH patients. Osteonecrotic bone trabecula (ONBT) such as necrosis, fibrosis, and lacuna were confirmed by histological examination in the patients. The adjacent ''normal'' bone trabecula (ANBT) did not show any pathological changes. Gene sequencing data revealed that although ANBT showed no significant histological changes, alteration of mRNA profiling in ANBT was observed, similarly to that in ONBT. Our results indicated that the alteration of mRNA profiling in ANBT may cause normal bone tissue to develop into necrotic bone. RNA-seq data indicated that 2297 differentially abundant mRNAs were found in the ONBT group (1032 upregulated and 1265 downregulated) and 1523 differentially abundant mRNAs in the ANBT group (744 upregulated and 799 downregulated) compared with the healthy control group. GO enrichment analysis suggested that fatty acid metabolism and degradation were the main zones enriched with differentially expressed genes (DEG). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that PPARγ pathway was the most significantly regulated pathway. Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), an osteoblast-enriched secreted protein, was significantly decreased in ONBT suggesting that downregulation of LCN2 might affect lipid metabolism and lead to , and thus promote pathogenesis of ONFH.© The Author(s) 2019.

The expression of 2, a  gene copy, partially compensates for  disruption due to exon-7 excision in 90% of transcripts subsequently explaining the strong clinical heterogeneity. Several alterations in energy metabolism, like glucose intolerance and , have been reported in SMA at both systemic and cellular level, prompting questions about the potential role of energy homeostasis and/or production involvement in disease progression. In this context, we have recently reported the tolerance of mild SMA-like mice ( ) to 10 months of low-intensity running or high-intensity swimming exercise programs, respectively involving aerobic and a mix aerobic/anaerobic muscular metabolic pathways. Here, we investigated whether those exercise-induced benefits were associated with an improvement in metabolic status in mild SMA-like mice. We showed that untrained SMA-like mice exhibited a dysregulation of lipid metabolism with an enhancement of lipogenesis and adipocyte deposits when compared to control mice. Moreover, they displayed a high oxygen consumption and energy expenditure through β-oxidation increase yet for the same levels of spontaneous activity. Interestingly, both exercises significantly improved lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis in SMA-like mice, and enhanced oxygen consumption efficiency with the maintenance of a high oxygen consumption for higher levels of spontaneous activity. Surprisingly, more significant effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol with the maintenance of high lipid oxidation. Finally, when combining electron microscopy, respiratory chain complexes expression and enzymatic activity measurements in muscle mitochondria, we found that (1) a muscle-specific decreased in enzymatic activity of respiratory chain I, II, and IV complexes for equal amount of mitochondria and complexes expression and (2) a significant decline in mitochondrial maximal oxygen consumption, were reduced by both exercise programs. Most of the beneficial effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol. Taking together, our data support the hypothesis that active physical exercise, including high-intensity protocols, induces metabolic adaptations at both systemic and cellular levels, providing further evidence for its use in association with SMN-overexpressing therapies, in the long-term care of SMA patients.Copyright © 2019 Houdebine, D’Amico, Bastin, Chali, Desseille, Rumeau, Soukkari, Oudot, Rouquet, Bariohay, Roux, Sapaly, Weill, Lopes, Djouadi, Bezier, Charbonnier and Biondi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497874>Delayed intervention with a novel SGLT2 inhibitor NGI001 suppresses diet-induced metabolic dysfunction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is closely related to metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia,  and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty acid synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in oleic acid-treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

In view of the frequent comorbidities of COPD, the economic impact of nonadherence and the potential for adverse effects, a direct comparison between the adherence to respiratory and nonrespiratory medication in the same patients seems of particular interest.We aimed to investigate the intake of respiratory and nonrespiratory medication in the same patients with COPD and frequent comorbidities.Within the COPD cohort COSYCONET, we contacted 1042 patients, mailing them a list with all medication regarding all their diseases, asking for regular, irregular and non-intake.Valid responses were obtained in 707 patients covering a wide spectrum of drugs. Intake of LABA, LAMA or ICS was regular in 91.9% of patients, even higher for cardiovascular and antidiabetes medication but lower for  and depression/anxiety medication. Regular intake of respiratory medication did not depend on GOLD groups A-D or grades 1-4, was highest in patients with concomitant cardiovascular disorders and was lowest for concomitant asthma. It was slightly larger for LAMA and LABA administered via combined compared to single inhalers, and lower when similar compounds were prescribed twice. Most differences did not reach statistical significance owing to the overall high adherence.Our results indicate a high adherence to respiratory medication in participants of a COPD cohort, especially in those with cardiovascular comorbidities.

Meanwhile, we synthesized and compared major recommendations and present the consistency and controversy in current dyslipidemia management.Among 19 guidelines included, ten guidelines ("strongly recommended" with AGREE scores 61-94%) performed better than the other nine (38-65% as "recommended with some modification") For blood lipid tests, most CHD guidelines simply required fasting sample while dyslipidemia guidelines preferred non-fasting sample except in high triglycerides state. Most guidelines consistently chose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as the primary lipid-lowering target (LLT), while non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B were mainly selected as secondary LLTs. The specific goals of LDL-C lowering were either to lower than 70 mg/dL or with at least 50% reduction. All guidelines recommended high intensity or maximally tolerable doses of statins, while ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors were recommended as second-line therapy.The general quality of guidelines for lipid management is satisfactory.

However, both the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and a Medicare Evidence Advisory Committee (MEDCAC) have cited gaps in the evidence for outcomes in Medicare patients undergoing bariatric surgery. These gaps are predominantly in the safety and outcomes evidence in Medicare patients younger than 65 years old (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS] < 65).The aim of our study was to review both the safety and efficacy of gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in Medicare patients compared with other payers.A single academic medical center.A prospectively maintained database of 3300 patients who underwent bariatric surgery between January 2007 and December 2017 was utilized. The outcomes of Medicare patients undergoing RYGB and SG were analyzed and compared to those of similar patients covered by Medicaid or Commercial insurers.There were too few patients with commercial insurance older than 65 to compare to those with Medicare (CMS ≥ 65). Mortality at 90 days for CMS ≥ 65 was 1.3% and the overall complication rate was 20.1% (minor 15.6%; major 7.1%). Total weight loss (TWL) at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3 years was 25.3%, 30.0%, 29.9%, and 29.4% respectively. For any time after surgery, 23% of CMS ≥ 65 had complete remission of diabetes and 45% had partial remission. Demographic analysis of CMS < 65 found Medicare patients were significantly older with more diabetes, hypertension and  than those with commercial payers. Mortality at 90 days for CMS < 65 was 0.6% and the overall complication rate was 18.3% (minor 14.3%; major 4.7%). Mortality was not significantly different between payers. After adjustment for baseline differences and comparing to the Medicare group, the commercial group was less likely to have minor complications (P = .019), any complications (P = .007), and extended length of stay (P < .001). The TWL for the entire cohort age <65 at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3 years was 28.1%, 34.1%, 34.1%, and 31.8% respectively. After adjusting for differences, there was no significant difference in TWL between payers. For any time after surgery, complete remission of diabetes was 45% in CMS < 65 patients and partial remission was 59%. The comparison of remission between groups was then adjusted for DiaRem score and surgery type. CMS < 65 patients had significantly less partial remission of diabetes than commercial patients (P = .034) but no difference in complete remission.RYGB and SG are both safe and effective in Medicare patients of all ages. CMS ≥ 65 have acceptable mortality and complication rates with TWL and diabetes remission similar to younger patients. CMS < 65 patients are older than those with commercial insurance with more comorbid disease. While they have longer hospital stays after bariatric surgery, their weight loss and complete remission of diabetes are no different than patients with Medicaid or commercial insurance.

For each 1.0 mmoL/L reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, statins reduce the risk of major vascular events by 21% and all-cause mortality by 9%. Owing to their clinical effectiveness and excellent safety profile, many Australians are prescribed statins. There has been widespread reporting of possible side-effects, particularly muscle pains. Conversely, statin cessation relating to possible side-effects exposes patients to increased risk of vascular events and death. Although there is clinical consensus for diagnosing rare side-effects (e.g. myopathy or rhabdomyolysis), confirming that statins cause other less common side-effects (e.g. memory impairment) is difficult as strong randomised trial evidence related to statins and non-muscle-related side-effects is lacking.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been treated well by the use of statins, but hypertriglyceridemia was not the case. Previous fibrates have been shown a certain effect of preventing CVD events, but some remain not enough or even could cause adverse events. Pemafibrate is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α modulator (SPPARMα) with the potential to reduce high triglycerides. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety profile of Pemafibrate, we have started with half dose once-daily administration.Thirty-three patients with hypertriglyceridemia, triglyceride (TG) levels > 150 mg/dL, were treated with Pemafibrate (0.1 mg, once daily) from July 2018 to February 2019. Changes in TG (non-fasting) and LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), creatinine (Cre), blood glucose (PBG) (postprandial), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and body weight (BW) levels were investigated, compared to the baseline levels of the previous visit.Of the 33 patients, 11 were using other fibrates before. Nine were given statins along with. Baseline TG was 285.0 (210.5 - 423.0) mg/dL, LDL-C 116.4 ± 33.4 mg/dL, and HDL-C 46.5 ± 12.5 mg/dL. TG changes were statistically significant (-20.8 ± 47.6%; P < 0.01). Patients with TG > 200 mg/dL, who used fibrates for the first time, experienced the most significant changes in TG levels (-34.5 ± 37.2%; P < 0.01). In patients using statins already, TG reduction was relatively less, compared to those not using statins (-25.4 ± 36.1%; P < 0.01). HDL-C increased by 3.9 ± 10.2 mg/dL (P < 0.05). LDL-C increased by 16.6 ± 23.7 mg/dL (P < 0.001) in patients not using statins, while patients using statins did not show such significant change. AST, ALT, CK, Cre, PBG, HbA1c and BW did not significantly change.A selective PPARα modulator, Pemafibrate, effectively improved hypertriglyceridemia without major adverse events in real practice, with half dose once-daily administration.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630906>Recurrence of a primary xanthoma of the humerus in a 9-year-old normolipidemic child.</a></h2><p>Xanthomas are rare bone tumors that occur more often in patients with  or metabolic disorders. We report the case of a 9-year-old child presenting with right shoulder pain after a trauma. A benign osteolytic lesion was found in the proximal humeral metaphysis. Curettage of the lesion was performed. Histologic findings confirmed intraosseous xanthoma. Although there was no evidence of dyslipidemia or metabolic disease, the patient suffered local recurrence at the 8-month follow-up, requiring a second surgery with bone grafting. This difficult and rare diagnosis must be kept in mind with osteolytic lesions.Copyright © 2019 French Society of Pediatrics. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is considered the reference method for 25(OH)D3, some compounds (carbohydrate, lipids, proteins, etc.) in the blood may cause a false result indicating a negative or positive deviation rate from the correct blood level of the test.In this paper, we report a case of D vitamin intoxication due to a false negative result caused by lipemia. A young woman with a complaint of pain in multiple joints applied to the physical therapy clinic and was found to have some cystic bone lesions. She was eventually diagnosed with DM tip 1, familial , and nephrolithiasis. Although she had D vitamin replacement therapy, low levels of blood 25(OH)D3 concentration, measured by an LC-MS/MS device, were detected. After blood dilution, a high level of 25(OH)D3 and blood intoxication due to lipid interference were indicated.From this case, we can conclude that analytical errors caused by the ingredients of a blood sample may lead to unnecessary treatment and intoxication. While evaluating the blood 25(OH)D3 levels, clinicians should guard against false-negative results due to interference in patients with familial .Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544583>1,25(OH)D improves blood lipid metabolism, liver function, and atherosclerosis by constraining the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway in rats with .</a></h2><p>1,25(OH)D has already been reported to function in some diseases. However, its role in  (HLP) remains unknown. This study aims to investigate the effect of 1,25(OH)D on HLP rats. Rat models were established by high-fat diet feeding, perfusion of different doses of 1,25-(OH)D and injection of TGF-β1 siRNA. Whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, hematocrit, and erythrocyte aggregation index were detected, together with levels of biochemical indexes, 6-keto-PGF1α, and TXB2 in serum. Levels of oxidative stress indexes and inflammatory factors in serum and liver tissues were determined. TGF-β1 and Smad3 expression in serum, liver tissues, and aorta was detected. 1,25(OH)D lowered HLP-induced rise of whole blood viscosity, red blood cell aggregation index, plasma viscosity, and hematocrit, TC, TG, LDL-C, apoB, ALT, AST, TXB2, MDA, IL-1β, TNF-α, and increased HLP-induced decrease of HDL-C, apoAI, 6-keto-PGF1α, SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and T-AOC. TGF-β1 and Smad3 expression in serum, liver tissue, and aorta of 1,25(OH)D-treated rats reduced. High 1,25(OH)D dose and inhibited TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway alleviated lipid metabolism, liver function, and atherosclerotic injury in HLP rats.

Pairwise AUC comparisons were performed to calculate the difference between scoring systems.A total of 238 patients diagnosed with HTG-AP were included. Sixty patients (25.2%) were classified as SAP. Twenty-nine patients (12.2%) had evidence of PNec. Nine patients (3.8%) were diagnosed with IPN. One patient (0.4%) died during hospitalization. In predicting SAP in HTG-AP, the AUCs of APACHE-II, SOFA, SIRS, Ranson's, BISAP, and MMS were 0.77, 0.83, 0.73, 0.88, 0.83, and 0.85, respectively; in predicting PNec, were 0.75, 0.77, 0.75, 0.86, 0.80, and 0.75, respectively; and in predicting IPN, were 0.92, 0.86, 0.76, 0.85, 0.84, and 0.87, respectively. Pairwise AUC comparisons revealed that Ranson's, MMS, BISAP, and SOFA had higher accuracy than SIRS, Ranson's and MMS had higher accuracy than APACHE-II in predicting SAP; Ranson's had the same accuracy with BISAP, but higher than other four criteria in predicting PNec; APACHE-II had higher accuracy than SIRS in predicting IPN.APACHE-II had high performance in predicting IPN, and all other score systems had medium performance in predicting SAP, PNec, and IPN in HTG-AP.

Little is known about these relationships specifically in young adulthood, an important time for the development of chronic disease.To determine the association between food insecurity and chronic disease including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and obstructive airway disease in a nationally representative sample of US young adults.Cross-sectional nationally representative data collected from Wave IV (2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health was analyzed using multiple logistic regression models.US young adults ages 24-32 years old MAIN MEASURES: Food insecurity and general health; self-reported diabetes, hypertension, , "very overweight," and obstructive airway disease; measured obesity derived from body mass index; and inadequate disease control (hemoglobin A1c ≥ 7.0%, blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg) among those with reported diabetes and hypertension.Of the 14,786 young adults in the sample, 11% were food insecure. Food-insecure young adults had greater odds of self-reported poor health (2.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63-4.24), diabetes (1.67, 95% CI 1.18-2.37), hypertension (1.40, 95% CI 1.14-1.72), being "very overweight" (1.30, 95% CI 1.08-1.57), and obstructive airway disease (1.48, 95% CI 1.22-1.80) in adjusted models compared with young adults who were food secure. Food insecurity was not associated with inadequate disease control among those with diabetes or hypertension.Food insecurity is associated with several self-reported chronic diseases and obesity in young adulthood. Health care providers should screen for food insecurity in young adults and provide referrals when appropriate.

Therefore, we conducted a preliminary study on the anti-obesity effect of PGE in 108 Korean adults (aged 20-60 years, 30 kg/m ≥ body mass index ≥ 23 kg/m). The participants were randomly assigned to four groups and were administered the placebo, PGE571 (571 mg as PGE), PGE1142 (1142 mg as PGE), and PGE2855 (2855 mg as PGE), independently, for 12 weeks. Body composition, nutrient intake, computed tomography scan, and plasma adipokines, as well as hepatic/renal function markers, were assessed. The PGE571 group revealed a significant decrease in body fat mass and body fat percentage when compared with the placebo group. Moreover, the total abdominal and subcutaneous fat areas were significantly decreased following PGE (PGE2855 group) supplementation.

Kaempferol showed LXR agonistic activities without inducing TGs or the expression of several lipogenic genes in cultured cells. A luciferase and qPCR analysis showed that kaempferol increased the transactivation of PPARα and PPARδ and stimulated gene expression associated with fatty acid oxidation and uptake in hepatocytes. More importantly, kaempferol inhibited protein kinase B (Akt) activity and suppressed SREBP-1 activation via multiple mechanisms, including through increasing Insig-2a expression, reducing SREBP-1 phosphorylation, and increasing GSK-3 phosphorylation. Collectively, these actions inhibited the SREBP-1 activation process. Furthermore, as an Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitor, kaempferol led to the induction of hepatic autophagy and resulted in a decrease in lipid droplet formation in the mouse liver. These findings demonstrate that kaempferol exerts its TG-lowering effect via Akt inhibition and activation of PPARα and PPARδ. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Kaempferol is a major dietary flavonoid in various plant-based foods, and it is used as a valuable ingredient in functional foods, with numerous beneficial properties such as anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-atherosclerotic activities. Kaempferol exerts its TG-lowering effect via Akt inhibition and activation of PPARα and PPARδ. Currently, the number of people with  is rapidly growing in both developed and developing societies; thus, we propose that kaempferol could be used for therapeutic interventions aimed at the treatment of these individuals.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508438>Diagnostic Criteria for Obesity Disease in Cats.</a></h2><p>Accumulated visceral and subcutaneous fat masses were measured with computed tomography (CT) in cats with various body condition scores (BCS) from 5/9 to 9/9. BCS does not always reflect visceral fat accumulation which induces pro-inflammatory reactions. Obese cats with accumulated visceral fat showed low plasma adiponectin and high serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations, an inflammatory marker. Based on the above results, new diagnostic criteria for obesity disease were established as follows. For overweight cats with high BCS of >7/9, showing two or more of the following three symptoms, low adiponectin concentrations, , and high SAA concentrations, categorizes them as having obesity disease. Cats with BCS 6/9-9/9, without inflammatory reactions, were classified as simple obesity, which is similar to metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) defined in human medicine. Simple obesity group showed significantly higher adiponectin concentrations than those in control group. The obesity disease group showed significantly higher plasma triglyceride (TG) and SAA concentrations and lower concentrations of adiponectin than the control group. Moreover, plasma glucose and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in the obesity disease group were higher than those in healthy control group, although the differences were not statistically significant. Establishing criteria for obesity disease based on visceral fat accumulation and inflammation markers levels contributes to early and correct diagnosis of obesity in cats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589318>Colesevelam enhances the beneficial effects of brown fat activation on  and atherosclerosis development.</a></h2><p>Brown fat activation accelerates the uptake of cholesterol-enriched remnants by the liver and thereby lowers plasma cholesterol, consequently protecting against atherosclerosis development. Hepatic cholesterol is then converted into bile acids (BAs) that are secreted into the intestine and largely maintained within the enterohepatic circulation. We now aimed to evaluate the effects of prolonged brown fat activation combined with inhibition of intestinal BA reabsorption on plasma cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis development.APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice with humanized lipoprotein metabolism were treated for 9 weeks with the selective β3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist CL316,243 to substantially activate brown fat. Prolonged β3-AR agonism reduced fecal BA excretion (-31%), while markedly increasing plasma levels of total BAs (+258%), cholic acid-derived BAs (+295%) and chenodeoxycholic acid-derived BAs (+217%), and decreasing the expression of hepatic genes involved in BA production. In subsequent experiments mice were additionally treated with the BA sequestrant Colesevelam to inhibit BA reabsorption. Concomitant intestinal BA sequestration increased fecal BA excretion, normalized plasma BA levels and reduced hepatic cholesterol. Moreover, concomitant BA sequestration further reduced plasma total cholesterol (-49%) and non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-56%), tended to further attenuate atherosclerotic lesion area (-54%). Concomitant BA sequestration further increased the proportion of lesion-free valves (+34%) and decreased the relative macrophage area within the lesion (-26%) thereby further increasing the plaque stability index (+44%).BA sequestration prevents the marked accumulation of plasma BAs as induced by prolonged brown fat activation thereby further improving cholesterol metabolism and reducing atherosclerosis development. These data suggest that combining brown fat activation with BA sequestration is a promising new therapeutic strategy to reduce  and cardiovascular diseases.Current therapeutic strategies are unable to prevent the majority of cardiovascular disease (CVD)-relating morbidities and mortalities, illustrating the need for new therapeutic strategies. Brown fat has been shown as an emerging target to combat  and atherosclerosis. Here we showed that prolonged brown fat activation promotes bile acid (BA) reabsorption, resulting in elevated plasma BA and hepatic cholesterol content, both of which are reversed by additional BA sequestration. Importantly, combining BA sequestration with brown fat activation further lowers plasma cholesterol and reduces atherosclerosis development, indicating the combination therapy as a new therapeutic strategy to treat , and ultimately CVD.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

In addition to lowering glucose in diabetes, these drugs may also protect against  and arteriosclerosis, which are risk factors for stroke. This is an update of a review first published in January 2014 and subsequently updated in December 2017.To assess the efficacy and safety of PPAR-γ agonists in the secondary prevention of stroke and related vascular events for people with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (30 July 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1949 to 30 July 2019), Embase (1980 to 30 July 2019), CINAHL (1982 to 30 July 2019), AMED (1985 to 30 July 2019), and 11 Chinese databases (30 July 2019). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials, we searched ongoing trials registers, reference lists, and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies. We did not impose any language restrictions.We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating PPAR-γ agonists versus placebo for the secondary prevention of stroke and related vascular events in people with stroke or TIA, with the outcomes of recurrent stroke, vascular events, and adverse events.Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross-checked the data for accuracy, and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias. We evaluated the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.We identified five RCTs with 5039 participants; two studies had a low risk of bias for all domains. Four studies evaluated the drug pioglitazone, and one study evaluated rosiglitazone. The participants in different studies were heterogeneous.Recurrent strokeThree studies evaluated the number of participants with recurrent stroke (4979 participants, a single study contributing 3876 of these). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists probably reduce the recurrence of stroke compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.99; moderate-quality evidence).Adverse eventsEvidence that adverse events occurred more frequently in participants treated with PPAR-γ agonists when compared with placebo was uncertain due to wide confidence interval and high levels of statistical heterogeneity: risk difference 10%, 95% CI -8% to 28%; low-quality evidence).Data were available on additional composite outcomes reflecting serious vascular events (all-cause death and other major vascular events; all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) from one study in 984 people. This study provided low-quality evidence that PPAR-γ agonists led to fewer events (data not meta-analysed).Vascular eventsPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists given over a mean duration of 34.5 months in a single trial of 984 participants may reduce serious vascular events expressed as a composite outcome of total events of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.99; low-quality evidence).Other outcomesOne study in 20 people measured insulin sensitivity, and one study in 40 people measured the ubiquitin-proteasome activity in carotid plaques. Our confidence in the improvements observed with PPAR-γ agonists were limited by small sample sizes and risk of bias. None of the studies reported the number of participants with disability due to vascular events or improvement in quality of life.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists probably reduce recurrent stroke and total events of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke, and may improve insulin sensitivity and the stabilisation of carotid plaques. Their effects on adverse events are uncertain. Our conclusions should be interpreted with caution considering the small number and the quality of the included studies. Further well-designed, double-blind RCTs with large samples are required to assess the efficacy and safety of PPAR-γ agonists in the secondary prevention of stroke and related vascular events in people with stroke or TIA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600750>Rodent Models of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a continuous diseases spectrum associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and . Simple hepatic steatosis may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), even fibrosis and cirrhosis, and finally hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, NAFLD has become a public health concern with increasing prevalence. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis remain incompletely understood, and few effective therapeutic approaches are available. Summary and Key Messages: A myriad of different rodent models has been developed to elucidate pathophysiology of NAFLD/NASH and guide therapeutic strategy. To date, no single rodent model can display the whole disease spectrum and metabolic features associated with human NASH, but can imitate particular characteristics. In this paper, we review the most commonly used dietary, genetic, and chemical rodent models for NAFLD referring to their advantages and disadvantages. Also, we illustrate the status of latest treatment strategy using various NAFLD rodent models. We hope to provide critical guidance for researchers to select appropriate animal models.© 2019 S.

Patients were stratified by smoking status at time of enrollment. The 1- and 5-year ischemic outcomes were compared.Among 24,354 patients with available data on smoking status, 6,722 (27.6%) were current smokers. Smokers were younger and less likely to have diabetes mellitus; hypertension; ; or prior myocardial infarction (MI), PCI, or coronary artery bypass grafting. Angiographically, smokers had longer lesions, more complex lesions, and more occlusions, but were less likely to have moderate or severe calcification or tortuosity. At 5 years, smokers had significantly higher rates of MI (7.8% vs. 5.6%; p < 0.0001) and definite or probable stent thrombosis (3.5% vs. 1.8%; p < 0.0001); however, there were no differences in the rates of death, cardiac death, target lesion revascularization, or composite endpoints (cardiac death, target vessel MI, or ischemic target lesion revascularization). After multivariable adjustment for potential confounders, smoking was a strong independent predictor of death (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.63 to 2.12; p < 0.0001), cardiac death (HR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.38 to 2.05; p < 0.0001), MI (HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.58; p < 0.0001), stent thrombosis (HR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.99; p < 0.0001), and target lesion failure (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.30; p = 0.005).The present large, patient-level, pooled analysis with 5-year follow-up clearly demonstrates smoking to be an important predictor of adverse outcomes after PCI.Copyright © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

The present study was designed to ascertain whether dexmedetomidine (Dex) treatment could reduce the incidence of cognitive dysfunction following surgery in a  model.  was induced in Sprague‑Dawley rats (male, 6‑7 months old) by consuming a high‑fat diet, and rats were divided into three groups (n=10 each) and underwent: exploratory laparotomy to introduce surgical trauma (surgery group), laparotomy and Dex treatment (surgery+Dex group), or sham surgery (sham group). Learning, memory and exploration behavior were assessed using the Morris water maze. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α and interleukin (IL)‑1β, were determined by enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. BBB permeability was assessed by Evans blue staining. Relative major facilitator superfamily domain‑containing protein 2 (Mfsd2a) mRNA expression was determined by quantitative PCR. In the Morris water maze test, the time and distance ratio for the surgery group was significantly lower than those of the sham and surgery+Dex groups (P<0.05). In addition, the TNF‑α concentrations in the sham and surgery+Dex groups were lower than that in the surgery group (P<0.05 on days 1 and 3). Evans Blue staining was increased in the surgery group on day 1 (P<0.01). Mfsd2a mRNA expression was higher in the sham and surgery+Dex groups compared with that noted in the surgery group (P<0.05). In conclusion, Dex treatment decreased the incidence of cognitive dysfunction following surgical trauma in a  rat model.

Our purpose was to develop a simple score to identify as large a group as possible with a suitable pretest risk of CAD.Retrospective study of patients in Denmark undergoing CAG due to newly diagnosed HF from 2010 to 2014. All Danish patients were registered in two databases according to geographical location. We used data from one registry and multiple logistic regression with backwards elimination to find predictors of CAD and used the derived OR to develop a clinical risk score called the CT-HF score, which was subsequently validated in the other database.The main cohort consisted of 2171 patients and the validation cohort consisted of 2795 patients with 24% and 27% of patients having significant CAD, respectively. Among significant predictor, the strongest was extracardiac arteriopathy (OR 2.84). Other significant factors were male sex, smoking, , diabetes mellitus, angina and age. A proposed cut-off of 9 points identified 61% of patients with a 15% risk of having CAD, resulting in an estimated savings of 15% of the cost and 21% of the radiation.A simple score based on clinical risk factors could identify HF patients with a low risk of CAD; these patients may have benefitted from MSCT as a gatekeeper for CAG.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Molecular genetic techniques such as next generation sequencing have been very successful methods for rare variants finding with a moderate-to large effect. In this study, we characterized a large pedigree from MASHAD study in northeast Iran with coinheritance of FCHL and early-onset coronary heart disease. In this family, we used whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing to determine the disease-associated gene. We identified a novel variant in the LPL gene, leading to a substitution of an asparagine for aspartic acid at position 151. The D151N substitution cosegregated with these characters in all affected family members in the pedigree but it was absent in all unaffected members in this family. We speculated that the mutation D151N in LPL gene might be associated with FCHL and early-onset coronary heart disease in this family. However, the substantial mechanism requires further investigation.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648462>[Clinical characteristics and prognosis between male and female patients with premature coronary artery disease after intervention].</a></h2><p> To compare the clinical characteristics and long-term prognosis between male and female patients with premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) post coronary intervention, and analyse the risk factors of major adverse cardio-cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and bleeding events.  This was a prospective single-center observational study. From January 2013 to December 2013, 4 744 patients diagnosed as PCAD and treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in Fuwai Hospital were enrolled. The general clinical data, laboratory results and interventional treatment data of all patients were collected, and patients were followed up for 2 years after PCI and the incidence of events including MACCE and bleeding was analyzed. The baseline data and clinical events of PCAD patients of different genders were compared. Survival curves were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to analyze whether gender was an influencing factor of different clinical events of PCAD patients within 2 years after PCI, and other relevant influencing factors of MACCE and bleeding events.  Among the 4 744 PCAD patients included, there were 3 390 (71.5%) male aged (47.0±5.4) years old and 1 354 (28.5%) female aged (57.0±5.8) years old. Compared with female patients, male patients had higher body mass index, higher proportion of , smoking, myocardial infarction, previous PCI, preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, radial artery approach, intravenous ultrasound use and chronic occlusive lesions (all 0.05). Age, left ventricular ejection fraction, prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, past stroke history, non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) and the use of calcium channel blockers were lower in male patients than in female patients (all 0.05). The 2-year follow-up results showed that the incidence of BARC type 1 hemorrhage was significantly higher in female patients than in male patients (6.9%(92/1 343) vs. 3.7%(126/3 378), 0.001); however, the incidence of MACCE, all-cause death, cardiac death, recurrent myocardial infarction, revascularization (target vessel revascularization and target lesion revascularization), stent thrombosis, stroke and BARC type 2-5 hemorrhage were similar between the two groups (all 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that gender was an independent risk factor for BARC type 1 bleeding in PCAD patients (=2.180, 95 1.392-3.416, 0.001), but it was not an independent risk factor for MACCE and BARC type 2-5 bleeding(all 0.05). , preoperative SYNTAX score, multivessel lesions and NSTE-ACS were the independent risk factors for MACCE in PCAD patients with PCI (the (95%) were 1.289(1.052-1.580), 1.030(1.019-1.042), 1.758(1.365-2.264), 1.264(1.040-1.537), respectively); gender (=1.579, 95 1.085-2.297, 0.017),  (=1.305, 95 1.005-1.695, 0.046), anticoagulant drugs including low molecular weight heparin (=1.321, 95 1.002-1.741, 0.048) or sulfonate(=1.659, 95 1.198-2.298, 0.002) were the independent risk factors for bleeding events.

(Mart.) O. Berg (Myrtaceae) leaves have been used to decrease cholesterol levels. However, studies to determine activities of this plant on triglycerides metabolism have received little attention. The aim of this study was to examine anti-hyperlipidemic effects of a  aqueous leaf extract (CxAE) and assess protective actions against oxidative stress and DNA damage. The tyloxapol-induced  model was used in Wistar rats. Rats were treated orally with CxAE either 250 or 500 mg/kg/day for 7 days prior to tyloxapol administration. Biochemical parameters, oxidative stress levels, and genomic instability were assessed in several tissues. CxAE decreased cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum and hepatic and renal DNA damage in tyloxapol-treated rats. There was no marked effect on the micronucleus frequency in bone marrow. The extract increased catalase activity and decreased glutathione S-transferase activity in kidney tissue. CxAE showed anti-hyperlipidemic effects, improved oxidative parameters, and protected DNA against damage induced by tyloxapol-induced , suggesting  leaves may be useful in preventing dyslipidemias.

Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody which has shown significant reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) serum levels and cardiovascular events. The aim of the study was to examine the comparative impact of LDL-apheresis vs Evolocumab vs the combination of both LDL-apheresis and Evolocumab on lipid and lipoprotein parameters, and other metabolic/inflammatory measures.Non-randomized open case series study of 10 adult patients diagnosed with FH already on long-term LDL-apheresis therapy. The study was developed in three consecutive phases to compare LDL-apheresis, Evolocumab treatment and the combination of both. Laboratory parameters were collected pre and post LDL-apheresis and before Evolocumab administration. The primary endpoint was the reduction of LDL-C during the three phases.Reduction of LDL-C levels with Evolocumab were 31.4% vs LDL-apheresis from 153 ± 35 mg/dL to 105 ± 56 mg/dL (P < .001). Reduction of Lp(a) was also significantly higher with Evolocumab (45.5%) than LDL-apheresis from 36 (6-119) to 20 (3-41) mg/dL, P = .027.

No changes in immunological or inflammatory parameters were observed and no serious adverse events were recorded.Evolocumab reduces LDL-C and Lp(a) more effectively than LDL-apheresis and combination of Evolocumab plus LDL-apheresis could be a therapeutic alternative to get lower LDL-C and Lp(a) levels in patients with very high cardiovascular risk.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665257>Subclinical leaflet thrombosis is associated with impaired reverse remodelling after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.</a></h2><p>Cardiac CT is increasingly applied for planning and follow-up of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, there are no data available on reverse remodelling after TAVI assessed by CT. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the predictors and the prognostic value of left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling following TAVI using CT angiography.We investigated 117 patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent CT scanning before and after TAVI procedure with a mean follow-up time of 2.6 years after TAVI. We found a significant reduction in LV mass (LVM) and LVM indexed to body surface area comparing pre- vs. post-TAVI images: 180.5 ± 53.0 vs. 137.1 ± 44.8 g and 99.7 ± 25.4 vs. 75.4 ± 19.9 g/m2, respectively, both P < 0.001. Subclinical leaflet thrombosis (SLT) was detected in 25.6% (30/117) patients. More than 20% reduction in LVM was defined as reverse remodelling and was detected in 62.4% (73/117) of the patients. SLT, change in mean pressure gradient on echocardiography and prior myocardial infarction was independently associated with LV reverse remodelling after adjusting for age, gender, and traditional risk factors (hypertension, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and ): OR = 0.27, P = 0.022 for SLT and OR = 0.22, P = 0.006 for prior myocardial infarction, OR = 1.51, P = 0.004 for 10 mmHg change in mean pressure gradient. Reverse remodelling was independently associated with favourable outcomes (HR = 0.23; P = 0.019).TAVI resulted in a significant LVM regression on CT. The presence of SLT showed an inverse association with LV reverse remodelling and thus it may hinder the beneficial LV structural changes. Reverse remodelling was associated with improved long-term prognosis.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author(s) 2019.

A total of 5325 individuals, 18 years of age and older, seen at an academic medical center for the primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack between the years of 2010-2017 were identified using the Kentucky Appalachian Stroke Registry. Descriptive analysis was used to report the prevalence of each comorbidity in the rural population by age group, gender, and level of multimorbidity by looking at concurrent frequencies.Overall, hypertension, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, diabetes, and obesity were the comorbidities with the highest prevalence in our population irrespective of gender. Over 78% (n = 4153) of the individuals had 3 or more comorbidities while 61% (n = 3285) had at least 3 out of the top 5 comorbidities (hypertension, , tobacco, obesity, diabetes). With respect to age, 15% (n = 795) of the sample was under the age of 50, while 32% (n = 1704) were between the age of 50 and 64 and 53% (n = 2826) of the sample were 65 years or older.The results of this study indicate the majority of individuals affected by stroke in rural Appalachia Kentucky have multimorbidity. In addition, almost half of these individuals are having their strokes at a younger age, which will require a shift in the focus for therapeutic interventions (eg, reintegration into the workforce versus just community reintegration).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Investigations included pure tone audiometry, random blood sugar/fasting blood sugar, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, fasting serum total cholesterol, and serum vitamin D levels. Patients were followed up for a period of 6 months to 1 year.Older age-group has an increased risk of BPPV and recurrence of symptoms. About 45.1% of the patients with BPPV who were detected to have symptoms of hypertension were also more common with hypertensive. Diabetes mellitus was found to have an increased risk of BPPV and its recurrence. The presence of other comorbidities, such as abnormal thyroid function test (9%), sensorineural hearing loss (14%), hypercholesterolemia (46%), and vitamin D deficiency (79%) didn't show any significant risk for recurrence.The presence of comorbidities worsens the status of BPPV, causing more frequent otolith detachment.

A dysfunctional lipid metabolism can lead to obesity and its complications such as hepatic steatosis, diabetes, and . In our study, the impact of  root ethanol extract (PGH) on lipid excretion and thermogenesis-related markers in diet-induced obesity mice was analyzed. Our data show that PGH elevated fatty acid uptake in epididymal adipose tissue by increasing  and  expression, which led to decreased blood free fatty acid concentrations. Moreover, PGH normalized body weight and fat mass in diet-induced obese mice by increasing lipolysis (, , and ) and fatty acid oxidation. Changes in the levels of browning-related genes, enzyme activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase, and the overall transcriptome (, , , , and ) led to promote brown adipose tissue-like features (browning) in epididymal white adipose tissue and enhanced energy expenditure.

The standardized MEACL was orally administered at different doses (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) to HFD-induced hyperlipidemic rats for five weeks. Serum lipid profile, body weight changes, body mass index (BMI), daily food intake, relative organ weight, and histology of the liver were evaluated. In addition, the effect of MEACL on HMG-CoA reductase and pancreatic lipase activities as well as hepatic and fecal lipids was demonstrated. MEACL supplementation reduced serum lipids in HFD-fed rats in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological scores revealed that 1000 mg/kg MEACL restored the damage to liver tissue in hyperlipidemic rats. MEACL decreased the body mass index (BMI), atherogenic index, and hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides and increased fecal cholesterol and bile acids in HFD-fed rats. Also, MEACL ameliorated lipid peroxidation and improved antioxidant defenses in the liver of HFD-fed rats. Furthermore, HMG-CoA reductase and lipase were suppressed by MEACL.

To our knowledge, this is the first large single-center series to evaluate this association.A retrospective chart review of adult patients presenting with ptosis on concomitant anticholesterol medications.Two hundred ninety-three adult patients with ptosis taking anticholesterol therapy were identified from October 2011 to October 2016. Forty-seven patients (16.0%) reported muscle weakness. Laboratory markers including creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin levels were obtained. Of the 47 patients, 13 patients (4.4%) were identified to have ptosis and laboratory confirmed anticholesterol therapy-induced myopathy. Two additional patients with statin-induced myositis and rhabdomyolysis were identified from the period 2008-2011. All patients had measurably elevated CK and/or myoglobin levels. All patients experienced improvement in ptosis or systemic symptoms after discontinuation or changing medications. Nine patients (60%) demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the ptosis.Many patients with involutional ptosis also have both cardiovascular disease and  and thus take cholesterol-lowering medication. Our study demonstrates a World Health Organization-defined probable association between ptosis and anticholesterol-induced myopathy. The frequency of anticholesterol-induced myopathy in adult ptosis was 4.4%, which is substantially higher than previously predicted. Anticholesterol-induced myositis can cause a reversible ptosis, and thus, a thorough evaluation of adult patients presenting with involutional ptosis includes inquiry into the use of anticholesterol drugs and associated muscle weakness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500259>Lime ( (Christm.)

The patients were divided into the insomnia (N = 24) and non-insomnia (N = 128) groups based on the Athens Insomnia Scale. The insomnia group was further divided into benzodiazepine (BDZ) and non-BDZ treatment groups according to BDZ use status after ischemic stroke. The transcranial doppler ultrasound (TCD) breath-holding test was performed to calculate the breath-holding index (BHI) of the responsible cerebral middle artery, which was used to evaluate CVR. Then, univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were carried out to determine the effect of insomnia after acute ischemic stroke on CVR.At one month after the onset of acute ischemic stroke, TCD-BHI was significantly higher in the non-insomnia group compared with the insomnia group (p = 0.027). In patients with insomnia, TCD-BHI was significantly higher in the BDZ treatment group compared with non-BDZ treatment group (p = 0.039). With age, hypertension, diabetes, , long-term smoking, blood homocysteine, and Athens Insomnia Scale score as independent variables, and TCD-BHI at one month after onset as a dependent variable, univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that the Athens Insomnia Scale score was an independent factor affecting TCD-BHI (regression coefficient, -0.013; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.024 to -0.003).Insomnia after acute ischemic stroke is an independent risk factor for CVR.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, we discovered that DNAs targeting microRNA-22-3p (miR-22-3p) hold the potential for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders (type 2 diabetes mellitus, , and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) by turning fat-storing white adipocytes into fat-burning adipocytes. In this work, we explored the effects of chemical modifications, including phosphorothioate (PS), locked nucleic acid (LNA), and peptide nucleic acid (PNA), on the structure and energy of DNA analogs by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To achieve a reliable prediction of the hybridization free energy, the AMOEBA polarizable force field and the free energy perturbation technique were employed. The calculated hybridization free energies are generally compatible with previous experiments. For LNA and PNA, the enhanced duplex stability can be explained by the preorganization mechanism, i.e., the single strands adopt stable helical structures similar to those in the duplex. For PS, the S and R isomers (Sp and Rp) have preferences for C2'-endo and C3'-endo sugar puckering conformations, respectively, and therefore Sp is less stable than Rp in DNA/RNA hybrids. In addition, the solvation penalty of Rp accounts for its destabilization effect. PS-LNA is similar to LNA as the sugar puckering is dominated by the locked sugar ring. This work demonstrated that MD simulations with polarizable force fields are useful for the understanding and design of modified nucleic acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505863>Hepatoprotective and Renoprotective Properties of Lovastatin-Loaded Ginger and Garlic Oil Nanoemulsomes: Insights into Serum Biological Parameters.</a></h2><p>: Dyslipidemia is gaining much attention among healthcare professionals because of its high association with the malfunctioning of a number of normal physiological and metabolic processes in the body.

TLR2-deficient mice were shown to have improved insulin sensitivity and reduced diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Previous studies demonstrated that prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure causes dyslipidemia accompanied by increased body weight and insulin resistance in offspring. To determine whether TLRs are involved in this complex abnormal phenotype, we analyzed TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels in adipose tissues from offspring with prenatal LPS-exposure (offspring-pLPS) and compared these levels to those of control offspring with prenatal saline-exposure (offspring-pSaline). TLR2 expression was specifically upregulated in the adipose tissue of offspring-pLPS mice. However, unexpectedly, TLR2-deficient offspring-pLPS mice not only presented with an abnormal phenotype comparable to that of wild-type offspring-pLPS mice but also exhibited significantly more severe . Our further analyses revealed a dramatic upregulation of TLR4 expression and overactivation of the TLR4/Myd88 signaling pathway in TLR2-deficient offspring-pLPS adipose tissue. Our finding suggests a compensatory genetic interaction between TLR2 and TLR4 in the context of prenatal inflammatory stimulation, and this interaction likely contributes to the prenatal inflammation-induced  and lipid overload-induced obesity, thus providing a potential mechanism for the fetal origin of adult metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547073>Factors Associated with Single-Use and Co-Use of Tobacco and Alcohol: A Multinomial Modeling Approach.</a></h2><p>Tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption are among the most important public health concerns not only in South Korea but also globally. This study identified the factors associated with single-use and co-use of tobacco and alcohol in Korean adults and provided more accurate estimates using a multinomial modeling approach. This study used the Korea Community Health Survey Data 2017, of which 205,336 respondents were selected as the sample for a multinomial logistic regression analysis. For the group that identified as only drinking monthly compared to the reference group, we found that the direction of the following factors was opposite to that of the results of the only currently smoking group: Age, marital status, educational level, monthly household income, occupation, obesity, self-rated health, hypertension, and . For the currently smoking and drinking monthly group relative to the reference group, the overall direction was a mix of the results of only currently smoking and only drinking monthly.

Using a large data base of patients who underwent coronary angiography for clinical reasons, we evaluated the association between reported degree of coronary calcification with mortality and baseline risk factors.Using angiographic data of 1917 patients from 1993 to 1997, we studied any association between the locations of coronary calcium that were seen during coronary angiography with coronary artery risk factors. Furthermore, we correlated the locations of calcium with all cause mortality.A total of 1917 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization from 1993 to 1997 were studied. Total mortality was 22.9%. There was no association between the classic coronary risk factors (history of hypertension, , smoking, diabetes mellitus and family history) or race (Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, and Asian) with the occurrence of angiographic visible calcium in any location. Furthermore, we did not find any association between the locations of coronary calcium with all cause mortality.

After summarising the demographics, geography and prevalence of MCC within this population, we then described groups of patients (segments) using a novel methodology: we combinatorially defined 18 768 potential segments of patients by a pair of chronic conditions, a sex and an age group, and then ranked segments by (1) frequency, (2) cost and (3) ratios of observed to expected frequencies of co-occurring chronic conditions. We then compiled pairs of conditions that occur more frequently together than otherwise expected.61.5% of the study population suffers from two or more chronic conditions. The most frequent dyad was hypertension and  (19%) and the most frequent triad was diabetes, hypertension and  (10%). Women aged 50 to 65 with hypertension and  were the leading cost segment in the study population. Costs and prevalence of MCC increase with number of conditions and age. The disease dyads associated with the largest observed/expected ratios were pulmonary disease and myocardial infarction. Inter-borough range MCC prevalence was 16%.In this low-income, urban population, MCC is more prevalent (61%) than nationally (42%), motivating further research and intervention in this population. By identifying potential target populations in an interpretable manner, this segmenting methodology has utility for health services analysts.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In particular, it has been proposed that obesity-related hypertension is caused by adipocyte-derived factors that are recognized as undetermined proteins secreted from adipocytes. Adipocyte-derived factors have been known to be related to aldosterone secretion in the adrenal gland. So far, Wnt proteins, CTRP-1, VLDL, LDL, HDL and leptin have been demonstrated to stimulate aldosterone secretion. In contrast, it has not yet been clarified whether adipocyte-derived factors also affect adrenal cortisol secretion.In the present study, we investigated the effect of adipocyte-derived factors on cortisol synthase gene CYP11B1 mRNA expression in vitro study using adrenocortical carcinoma H295R cells and mouse fibroblast 3T3-L1cells. Interestingly, adipocyte-derived factors were demonstrated to have the ability to stimulate CYP11B1 mRNA expression.Since CYP11B1 is well known as a limiting enzyme of cortisol synthesis, our study suggests that adipocyte-derived factors may stimulate cortisol secretion, as well as aldosterone secretion. Taken together, adipocyte-derived factors may be the cause of metabolic syndrome due to their stimulating effects on aldosterone/cortisol secretion. Therefore, the innovation of novel drugs against them may possibly be a new approach against metabolic syndrome.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508609>Effects of Periodontal Intervention on Levels of Serum High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein and Interleukin 6, and on Carotid Artery in Rats with Chronic Periodontitis and .</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of nonsurgical periodontal therapy on the serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and on the carotid artery in rats with chronic periodontitis (CP) and with or without  (HL).A total of 29 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: group A (CP, n = 14) and B (CP + HL, n = 15), and subjected to the corresponding treatment. Groups A and B were further divided into groups A1/B1 (without periodontal interventions) and A2/B2 (with periodontal interventions).

Yet, the contribution of genetics to VAT, as well as its disease-related effects, are largely unexplored due to the requirement for advanced imaging technologies to accurately measure VAT. Here, we develop sex-stratified, nonlinear prediction models (coefficient of determination = 0.76; typical 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74-0.78) for VAT mass using the UK Biobank cohort. We performed a genome-wide association study for predicted VAT mass and identified 102 novel visceral adiposity loci. Predicted VAT mass was associated with increased risk of hypertension, heart attack/angina, type 2 diabetes and , and Mendelian randomization analysis showed visceral fat to be a causal risk factor for all four diseases. In particular, a large difference in causal effect between the sexes was found for type 2 diabetes, with an odds ratio of 7.34 (95% CI = 4.48-12.0) in females and an odds ratio of 2.50 (95% CI = 1.98-3.14) in males. Our findings bolster the role of visceral adiposity as a potentially independent risk factor, in particular for type 2 diabetes in Caucasian females. Independent validation in other cohorts is necessary to determine whether the findings can translate to other ethnicities, or outside the UK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528283>Herpes encephalitis : a stroke mimicker.</a></h2><p>: HSV-1 encephalitis (HSVE) usually presents with fever, altered mental status or focal seizures.

Although approved for triglyceride (TG) lowering, IPE had only a modest TG-lowering effect in REDUCE-IT, largely because median TG levels were relatively low already. Hence the question of what mechanisms IPE might be working through is of great interest.

Angioedema has specifically been associated with the use of several antipsychotic agents, including clozapine, olanzapine, iloperidone, haloperidol, quetiapine, paliperidone, ziprasidone, risperidone, and chlorpromazine. A 67-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease requiring stent placement, mitral insufficiency, , tobacco use disorder, and schizophrenia presented with altered mental status and disorientation in the setting of clozapine nonadherence, which prompted acute hospitalization for clozapine reinitiation. During clozapine titration, the patient developed edema, erythema, and pruritus on his face and arms along with lip swelling characteristic of angioedema. Upon discontinuation of clozapine, the patient was trialed on several other antipsychotic medications to help manage acute psychosis and subsequently developed angioedema symptoms with trials of both olanzapine and quetiapine. Following these 3 distinct events of angioedema, the clinical decision was made to no longer trial atypical antipsychotics for the patient, and loxapine was cautiously initiated. The patient responded well to loxapine and continued to tolerate loxapine therapy for years. This case report identifies angioedema cross-reaction linked with 3 second-generation antipsychotics. Given the potentially life-threatening nature of angioedema, awareness of recurrent angioedema should be undertaken when trialing antipsychotics following an episode of angioedema correlated to antipsychotic use, particularly when trialing antipsychotics from the same generation and with similar chemical structures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491954>Cyanate Induces Oxidative Stress Injury and Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Liver through Nrf2/HO-1.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is problem that has become one of the major issues affecting public health. Extensive clinical data suggests that the prevalence of  in CKD patients is significantly higher than in the general population. Lipid metabolism disorders can damage the renal parenchyma and promote the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cyanate is a uremic toxin that has attracted widespread attention in recent years. Usually, 0.8% of the molar concentration of urea is converted into cyanate, while myeloperoxidase (MPO) catalyzes the oxidation of thiocyanate to produce cyanate at the site of inflammation during smoking, inflammation, or exposure to environmental pollution. One of the important physiological functions of cyanate is protein carbonylation, a non-enzymatic post-translational protein modification. Carbamylation reactions on proteins are capable of irreversibly changing protein structure and function, resulting in pathologic molecular and cellular responses. In addition, recent studies have shown that cyanate can directly damage vascular tissue by producing large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress leads to the disorder of liver lipid metabolism, which is also an important mechanism leading to cirrhosis and liver fibrosis. However, the influence of cyanate on liver has remained unclear. In this research, we explored the effects of cyanate on the oxidative stress injury and abnormal lipid metabolism in mice and HL-7702 cells. In results, cyanate induced  and oxidative stress by influencing the content of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) in liver. Cyanate inhibited NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and the phosphorylation of adenosine 5'monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), activated the mTOR pathway. Oxidative stress on the cells reduced significantly by treating with TBHQ, an antioxidant, which is also an activator of Nrf2. The activity of Nrf2 was rehabilitated and phosphorylation of mTOR decreased. In conclusion, cyanate could induce oxidative stress damage and lipid deposition by inhibiting Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which was rescued by inhibitor of Nrf2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588578>A systematic review of community nursing interventions focusing on improving outcomes for individuals exhibiting risk factors of cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>To examine the role of community-based nursing interventions in improving outcomes for community-dwelling individuals exhibiting risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD).A systematic review and narrative synthesis.Seven electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Global Health, LILACS, Africa-Wide Information, IMEMR, and WPRIM) were searched from inception to 16 March 2018.This review included outcomes from studies that were led by or delivered primarily by nurses for individuals exhibiting risk factors of CVD in community settings. At least two independent reviewers performed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias.46 studies met the eligibility criteria. Community nursing interventions were found to be effective in improving clinical outcomes of symptom control, symptom awareness, symptom management, and social outcomes. Effective interventions were found to be facilitated by a community-centric approach, participant empowerment, reinforcement strategies, a targeted approach towards underserved populations, and home visits. These resulted in positive outcomes such as significant reductions in HbA1c for diabetic patients, attainment of blood pressure targets for hypertensive patients and greater improvement in self-reported dietary intake for patients with .Community-based nurse-led interventions can result in positive outcomes for patients with risk factors of CVD.

We aimed to examine whether birth weight classification according to customized charts is superior to population charts at identification of newborns at risk of adverse cardio-metabolic and respiratory health outcomes.In a population-based prospective cohort study among 6052 pregnant women and their children, we measured infant catch-up growth, overweight, high blood pressure, , liver steatosis, clustering of cardio-metabolic risk factors, and asthma at age 10. Small size and large size for gestational age at birth was defined as birth weight in the lowest or highest decile, respectively, of population or customized charts. Association with birth weight classification was assessed using logistic regression models.Of the total of 605 newborns classified as small size for gestational age by population charts, 150 (24.8%) were reclassified as appropriate size for gestational age by customized charts, whereas of the total of 605 newborns classified as large size for gestational age by population charts, 129 (21.3%) cases were reclassified as appropriate size for gestational age by customized charts. Compared to newborns born appropriate size for gestational age, newborns born small size for gestational age according to customized charts had increased risks of infant catch-up growth (odds ratio (OR) 5.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.22 to 6.29)), high blood pressure (OR 2.05 (95% CI 1.55 to 2.72)), and clustering of cardio-metabolic risk factors at 10 years (OR 1.66 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.34)). No associations were observed for overweight, , liver steatosis, or asthma. Newborns born large-size for gestational age according to customized charts had higher risk of catch-down-growth only (OR 3.84 (95% CI 3.22 to 4.59)). The direction and strength of the observed associations were largely similar when we used classification according to population charts.Small-size-for-gestational-age newborns seem to be at risk of long-term adverse cardio-metabolic health outcomes, irrespective of the use of customized or population birth weight charts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581577>Pharmacophore Directed Screening of Agonistic Natural Molecules Showing Affinity to 5HT Receptor.</a></h2><p>Obesity prevalence continues to be a foremost health concern across the globe leading to the development of major health risk conditions like type II diabetes, , hypertension and even cancers. Because of the deprived drug-based management system, there is an urgent need for the development of new drugs aiming at satiety and appetite control targets. Among the reported satiety signaling targets, 5HT receptor plays a crucial role in decreasing appetite and has become a promising target for the development of anti-obesity drugs. Lorcaserin, a 5HT receptor agonist and the only drug available in the market, was designed based on the receptor mechanism of action. Due to limited drug options available and considering the adverse drug effects of Lorcaserin, the development of new drugs which are highly specific toward the 5HT target and with lesser side effects is essential. The present study is majorly focused on developing new 5HT agonists through computational approaches like screening, docking, and simulation using Phase, QikProp, Glide and Desmond applications of the Schrodinger suite. Screening protocols resulted in eight best hit molecules with affinity for the receptor and among them, five hits displayed binding affinity toward the conserved residue Asp 134 of the receptor. The stability of the five molecules in complex with the 5HT receptor was studied through molecular dynamic simulations. Three molecules, ZINC32123870, ZINC40312983 and ZINC32124535, maintained stable interactions with the Asp 134 residue throughout the 50 ns simulation run time. Further, due to the high sequence similarity seen among the receptors of 5HT2 family, the three potential hits were cross validated against other subtypes 5HT and 5HT of the 5HT2 family to determine the specificity of the molecules against the target. Among the three hits, ZINC32124535 was identified as the best potential hit based on the hydrogen bond interaction percentage with Asp residue [5HT (Asp 155:60%); 5HT (Asp155: No interaction); 5HT (Asp 134:86%)]. The ZINC32124535 molecule produced one salt bridge and hydrogen bond interactions with Asp 134, alike the known drug Lorcaserin. Based on the results, ZINC32124535 was identified as the best potential hit against the 5HT receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584433>Relationship of serum salusin beta levels with coronary slow flow.</a></h2><p>The pathophysiology of coronary slow flow (CSF) has not been clarified. Salusin-β is released predominantly from the atheroma plaques and influences the pathophysiologic processes of atherosclerosis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine serum salusin-β levels in CSF and its correlation with CSF.The study included 39 patients with CSF, and the control group (n=42) consisted of consecutive subjects with normal coronary arteriogram. We measured salusin-β and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count (TFC).Age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, diabetes, , and smoking rates were similar (p values>0.05) in both groups. High sensitive C-reactive protein (2.80±1.2 vs. 2.21±1.2 mg/dL, p=0.011), salusin-β [1205 (330-2092) vs. 162 (29-676), pg/ml, p<0.001], corrected TFC of left anterior descending coronary artery (29±9 vs. 19.7±3.7, p<0.001), circumflex artery TFC (25±10 vs. 15±3.2, p<0.001), right coronary artery TFC (28±7.1 vs. 13±3.3, p<0.001), and mean TFC (28±4.4 vs. 16±3.7, p<0.001) were significantly higher in the CSF group. In univariate and multivariate regression analysis, only BMI (unstandardized β±SE=0.178±0.08, p=0.036) and salusin-β levels (unstandardized β±SE=0.006±0.01, p<0.001) were determined as predictors of CSF. There was a good correlation between serum salusin-β and mean TFC values (r=0.564; p<0.001).There is an association between serum salusin-β levels and CSF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532959>Polypill for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in an Underserved Population.</a></h2><p>Persons with low socioeconomic status and nonwhite persons in the United States have high rates of cardiovascular disease. The use of combination pills (also called "polypills") containing low doses of medications with proven benefits for the prevention of cardiovascular disease may be beneficial in such persons. However, few data are available regarding the use of polypill therapy in underserved communities in the United States, in which adherence to guideline-based care is generally low.We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving adults without cardiovascular disease. Participants were assigned to the polypill group or the usual-care group at a federally qualified community health center in Alabama. Components of the polypill were atorvastatin (at a dose of 10 mg), amlodipine (2.5 mg), losartan (25 mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg). The two primary outcomes were the changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level at 12 months.The trial enrolled 303 adults, of whom 96% were black. Three quarters of the participants had an annual income below $15,000. The mean estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk was 12.7%, the baseline blood pressure was 140/83 mm Hg, and the baseline LDL cholesterol level was 113 mg per deciliter. The monthly cost of the polypill was $26. At 12 months, adherence to the polypill regimen, as assessed on the basis of pill counts, was 86%. The mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 9 mm Hg in the polypill group, as compared with 2 mm Hg in the usual-care group (difference, -7 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -12 to -2; P = 0.003). The mean LDL cholesterol level decreased by 15 mg per deciliter in the polypill group, as compared with 4 mg per deciliter in the usual-care group (difference, -11 mg per deciliter; 95% CI, -18 to -5; P<0.001).A polypill-based strategy led to greater reductions in systolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol level than were observed with usual care in a socioeconomically vulnerable minority population.

We investigated the effect of amygdalin on the cell death and the level of pro-apoptotic Bax protein and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cell line. The cell viability of SK-BR-3 cells was evaluated by MTT assay in different concentration of amygdalin. The level of Bax and Bcl-2 in SK-BR-3 cells were measured by western blot analysis. For statistical analysis, One-way ANOVA was used for the comparison of Bax and Bcl-2 protein level and percent of cell viability between groups. The molecular docking studies of amygdalin within the Bcl-2 (PDB ID: 4LVT) and HER2 (PDB ID: 3RCD) active site, were performed using AutoDock 4.2.5. Amygdalin induced a significant reduction of cell viability in SK-BR-3 after 24-h treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Also, amygdalin causes an increase in pro-apoptotic Bax protein and a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression in the SK-BR-3 cells. Molecular docking studies showed that amygdalin interacts with the active site amino acids of Bcl-2 and HER2 through hydrogen bonding and some hydrophobic interactions. Amygdalin can induce apoptotic death in SK-BR-3 cells by increasing pro-apoptotic Bax protein and decreasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. The results suggest that amygdalin may be a valuable candidate for the treatment of breast cancer, especially in HER2 positive cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658127>Phase Transition Is Infrequent Among North American Adults With e-Antigen-Negative Chronic Hepatitis B and Low-Level Viremia.</a></h2><p>Patients with hepatitis B early antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and low-level viremia are a heterogeneous group. Identifying those at risk of developing active CHB requiring antiviral therapy is important. In this study, we prospectively characterize incidence rates and predictors of transitioning from inactive to active CHB in a North American adult cohort.Participants in the multicenter National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Hepatitis B Research Network cohort who were HBeAg negative with baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA ≤ 10,000 IU/mL were included in the study. Cox regression models were used to estimate the proportion of individuals in 3 baseline HBV DNA categories (≤100, 101 to ≤2,000, and 2,001 to ≤10,000 IU/mL) who developed phase transition defined by HBV DNA > 10,000 IU/mL and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2× upper limit of normal or initiated treatment during follow-up.Of 970 participants meeting inclusion criteria, 15% experienced phase transition or initiated treatment over a median follow-up of 4 years: 9% of those with baseline HBV DNA ≤ 100 IU/mL, 14% with HBV DNA 101 to ≤2,000 IU/mL, and 24% with HBV DNA 2,001 to ≤10,000 IU/mL (P < 0.001). The overall rate of phase transition or treatment initiation was 7.6 per 100 person-years: 4.6 in those with HBV DNA ≤ 100 IU/mL, 6.8 in those with HBV DNA 101 to ≤2,000 IU/mL, and 12.2 in those with HBV DNA 2,001 to ≤10,000 IU/mL (P < 0.001). Factors independently associated with higher rate of phase transition or treatment initiation included HBV genotype B or C, higher baseline ALT and HBV DNA levels, lower platelet count, quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen > 1,000 IU/mL, and . Only higher ALT, higher HBV DNA, and lower platelets were associated with phase transition when patients starting treatment were censored.Most adults in this North American cohort with HBeAg-negative CHB and low-level viremia remained inactive and off treatment over 4 years. Transition from inactive to active CHB is infrequent and predominantly associated with viral rather than host factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494591>Statin-induced delayed rhabdomyolysis.</a></h2><p>An elderly woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, mesenteric vein thrombosis, depression and  on statins for >9 years presented with new-onset leg weakness, falls, dark-coloured urine, transaminitis and rhabdomyolysis (creatinine phosphokinase 12 896 U/L; aldolase 45.9 (normal <7.7 U/L).

GLP-1 RAs are listed as second-line treatment in the 2017 Chinese Guideline for patients with T2DM in whom prior oral antidiabetic therapy has failed. This study compares the baseline characteristics of Chinese patients with T2DM taking different prescriptions of first injectable therapy (GLP-1-RA or insulin).The IQVIA Patient Diary Study database, which captures data from a patient medical record-based physician online survey, was the data source used in this study. Cross-sectional patient data were collected from hospitals in 15 major Chinese cities from June 1, 2016, to June 30, 2018. Adults with T2DM commencing either GLP-1-RA or insulin use as their first injectable antidiabetic therapy were included. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the GLP-1-RA and insulin treatment groups, using t tests and χ or Fisher exact tests.Overall, 563 patients using GLP-1-RAs and 2387 using insulin were identified. In general, patients using GLP-1-RA were younger (mean [SD], 49.6 [10.8] years vs 59.3 [10.9] years), had lower mean (SD) glycosylated hemoglobin levels (8.5% [1.2%] vs 9.6 [1.7%]), had lower mean (SD) fasting plasma glucose levels (9.0 [1.9] mmol/L vs 10.8 [2.6] mmol/L), higher mean (SD) body mass indexes (29.4 [3.9] kg/m vs 24.6 [3.1] kg/m), had higher comorbidity of obesity (75% vs 15%), had a higher occurrence of  (63% vs 44%), and had lower occurrence of neuropathy (13% vs 34%) when compared with those using insulin (P < 0.0001 for all). The results of multivariate logistic regression model indicate that when controlling other variables in the multivariate logistic regression model, a higher fasting plasma glucose level and a longer diagnosis duration are associated with higher odds of insulin therapy commencement, but higher body mass index and some comorbidities, such as obesity and , are associated with higher odds of being a GLP-1-RA user.Significant differences were identified between selected baseline characteristics of patients initiating GLP-1-RA and insulin therapy, suggesting that these medicines are more likely to be prescribed to different types of patients with T2DM in China. These findings may help to inform Chinese physicians regarding the characteristics of those patients with T2DM who are initiating treatment with a GLP-1-RA or insulin. Because the Patient Diary Study data were collected from hospitals in 15 major cities in China, one noteworthy limitation is that the results may not represent the overall treatment pattern in rural areas of China.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, pathological details and molecular mechanisms underlying early atherogenesis remain incompletely characterized. This study explored the early events of atherogenesis in a hypercholesterolemic zebrafish model in vivo.We used transparent transgenic zebrafish larvae Tg(lysc:EGFP), Tg(mpx:EGFP), Tg(mpeg1:EGFP), Tg(flk1:EGFP) or Tg(lysc:EGFP/flk1:mCherry), together with fluorescently labeled control and high cholesterol diets (HCD), to dynamically investigate the early development of atherosclerosis with confocal in vivo. Endothelial cells with green fluorescence were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to detect gene expression. Moreover, we treated hypercholesterolemic zebrafish model in vivo or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro with rosiglitazone, an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ).We found that HCD-induced endothelial inflammation was an earlier pathological alteration than myeloid cells/neutrophils accumulation and lipid deposition in zebrafish vascular vessels of HCD-fed zebrafish. Endothelial inflammation was characterized by down-regulation of anti-inflammatory PPARγ and upregulation of pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Pharmacological treatment with rosiglitazone reversed the decrease in the expression of PPARγ and decreased expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in HCD-fed zebrafish. Moreover, rosiglitazone ameliorated myeloid cells accumulation and lipid deposition in HCD-fed zebrafish in vivo.-induced endothelial inflammation happens earlier than myeloid cell neutrophils accumulation in vascular vessels, and neutrophils accumulation is prior to lipid deposition during the initial stage of atherosclerosis. Early alleviation of inflammation induced by HCD would have a prophylactic effect for the initial development of atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Age, gender, tobacco use, comorbid diseases, body mass index (BMI), ejection fraction (EF), claudication distance (0 to 50 metres, 50 to 100 metres and 100 to 150 metres), preoperative Rutherford scale and Ankle-brachial index (ABI) are noted for each subject. A duplex ultrasound (DUS) was performed preoperatively. The localization side of the lesion (right-left), the length of the atherosclerotic segment (CM) and the localization of the diseased segment (proximal superficial femoral artery-SFA, mid SFA, distal SFA, popliteal-above the knee) were noted. Subjects were followed for at least one year after the procedure. Subjects were reevaluated in the 1, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. In control subjects, Rutherford class and ABI were noted. A DUS was performed to detect restenosis. The subjects' preoperative Rutherford class and ABI and restenosis degree were compared with their postoperative values.A total of 93 subjects (75.3% male, 24.7% female; mean age 68.57±8.70 years old) were evaluated. In all 93 (100%) subjects, successful RPA access was achieved. Overall, balloon dilatation via PPA was successful in 86 (92.47%) of the 93 subjects. The procedural success rate was 92.47%. The occluded segment was on the right side in 49.5% of the subjects (n = 46) and on the left side in 50.5% (n = 47) of the subjects. The mean length of the lesion was 10.77 ± 2.21 cm, and the average stenosis degree was 95.9 ± 5.05%. The localization of the occluded segment was in the proximal SFA, mid SFA, distal SFA and popliteal above the knee in 45.2%, 50.5%, 25.8% and 10.8% of the patients, respectively. When comparing the successful and unsuccessful groups, target lesion length (10.48±2.01 vs 14.43±0.79, p <0.001), mid SFA localization (n=40 vs n=7, p=0,012) and claudication distance in the first 50 metres (p=0,003) were significantly higher in subjects with failed balloon dilatation via RPA. When the Rutherford scale was examined, the mild, moderate and severe claudication ratios were 23.7%, 29% and 47.3%, respectively. After the procedure, 61.3% of the cases were asymptomatic, and 38.7% had mild claudication. The change in the Rutherford scale was statistically significant (p<0,001). When the ABI measurements were examined pre-procedure, it increased from 0,63 ± 0,08 before to 0,90 ± 0,06 after the procedure, indicating a statistically significant difference (p <0,001). When Doppler findings were examined, in the successful RPA group, the no stenosis percentages were 82.6%, 72.1% and 65.1 at the 1, 6 and 12 month follow-up, respectively. The mean disease-free survival time was 9,80±0,39 months. In the first year, subjects were divided according to stenosis degree. Subjects with less than 50% stenosis were compared with subjects with more than 50% stenosis to detect the preprocedural characteristics that affect the re-stenosis degree. Tobacco use, COPD, , chronical renal insufficiency and popliteal above the knee localization were significantly higher in subjects that had more than 50% stenosis 1 year after the procedure (p=0,009, p=0,015, p=0,044, p=0,001 and p=0,017, respectively).Retrograde popliteal access(RPA) under DUS guidance is an effective method. RPA have high procedural success rate with low morbidity. Longer target lesion length, mid SFA locatization and claducation distance in first 50 meters found to be related factors with RPA balloon dilatation failure. Re-stenosis rates after 12 months follow-up is low and comparable with literature.Copyright © 2019.

The main function of these cells is to produce and secrete insulin in response to a rise in circulating levels of glucose and other nutrients. The release of insufficient insulin to cover the organism needs results in chronic hyperglycemia and diabetes development. β-cells insure a highly specialized task and to efficiently accomplish their function they need to express a specific set of genes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs and key regulators of gene expression. Indeed, by partially pairing to specific sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs, each of them can control the translation of hundreds of transcripts. In this review, we focus on few key miRNAs controlling islet function and discuss: their differential expression in Type 2 diabetes (T2D), their regulation by genetic and environmental factors, and their therapeutic potential. Genetic and epigenetic changes or prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia and/or  can affect the β-cell miRNA expression profile, resulting in impaired β-cell function and survival leading to the development of T2D. Experimental approaches permitting to correct the level of mis-expressed miRNAs have been shown to prevent or treat T2D in animal models, suggesting that these small RNAs may become interesting therapeutic targets. However, translation of these experimental findings to the clinics will necessitate the development of innovative strategies allowing safe and specific delivery of compounds modulating the level of the relevant miRNAs to the β-cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This article aims to evaluate the possibility of Sirt1 serum levels predicting high-risk coronary plaques revealed through computed tomography angiography (CTA).The current cross-sectional investigation was performed on patients from non high-risk plaque (HRP) group (control group) as well as HRP group. CTA was conducted and the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) was generated each patient. Serum Sirt1 level was determined through ELISA. Univariate analysis and receiver-operating characteristic curve were used to examine the role of Sirt1 to predict HRP.Lower Sirt1 serum levels were observed in patients in the HRP group in comparison with those in the control group. Gender, , age, the total cholesterol to high-density lipoproteincholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, HDL-C, apolipoprotein B and Sirt1 displayed independent association with HRP as revealed by the univariate analysis. Area under curve of the univariate model for HRP was 0.848 (95% confidence interval: 0.798-0.899); 75.4% specificity, 75.2% sensitivity, the negative predictive value was 83.0%, and the positive predictive value was 66.2%.Low serum level of Sirt1 predicted HRP in individuals with low-intermediate FRS, implying that Sirt1 may play a predictive role in the plaque screening before coronary CTA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651884>Increased Elabela levels in the acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction patients.</a></h2><p>Elabela is a bioactive peptide and a part of Apelinergic system. Elabela has an important role in the early embryonic stages. Elabela's beneficial effects in cardiovascular system were shown in some animal models or in vitro studies. Lately, some investigational studies in humans are started to be seen in literature. Our aims were to investigate serum Elabela levels in the first day of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), to compare with healthy controls, and to see if there is a correlation between other cardiac biomarkers in humans.The study was planned as cross-sectional. The patients group had 124 STEMI subjects. They were grouped as inferior (n = 59) and anterior myocardial infarction (n = 65) groups, and compared with the healthy control population (n = 77). Routine blood tests and serum Elabela levels were measured. Transthoracic echocardiography performed to all subjects.Frequency of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, and  in both STEMI groups were significantly higher than control subjects. Glucose, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, high sensitive C reactive protein (Hs-CRP), troponin I, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP), and Elabela levels were significantly higher in both STEMI groups. Other laboratory parameters were similar. Group 2 and 3 had significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) than group 1. Group 3 had also significantly lower LVEF than group 2. There was a positive but moderate correlation between Elabela, troponin I, and NT-ProBNP. Elabela was negatively correlated with LVEF.

CC-IMT, AA-IMT, and TA-IMT values were measured. Patients with CC-IMT > 0.9 mm were considered as having increased CC-IMT. Patients were divided into two groups with and without increased CC-IMT.Mean AA-IMT and TA-IMT values of all patients were 1.55 ±0.27 mm and 1.39 ±0.25 mm, respectively. In patients with increased CC-IMT, blood pressure,  and hypertension frequency, creatinine, total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and uric acid levels, AA-IMT and TA-IMT values were higher, while the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level was lower than the normal CC-IMT group. AA-IMT, systolic blood pressure (SBP), total and HDL cholesterol levels independently determined the patients with CC-IMT > 0.9 mm. Each 0.1 mm increase in AA-IMT value was found to increase the probability of having CC-IMT > 0.9 mm. In addition, linear regression analysis showed that CC-IMT was closely and independently related to AA-IMT ( < 0.001 and β = 0.599). When the cut-off value for AA-IMT was taken as 1.5 mm, it determined the patients with CC-IMT > 0.9 mm with 86% sensitivity and 82% specificity.The AA-IMT value was found to be higher than TA-IMT in the same patient.

In general, glutathionylation occurs under the condition of elevated oxidative stress in vivo. In human hemoglobin, Cys93 residue of β globin chain was found to undergo this oxidative modification. Glutathionyl hemoglobin (GSHb) was reported to act as a biomarker of oxidative stress under several clinical conditions such as chronic renal failure, iron deficiency anemia, , diabetes mellitus, Friedreich's ataxia, atherosclerosis. Previously we showed that the functional abnormality associated with six-fold tighter oxygen binding of GSHb supposedly attributed to the conformational transition of the deoxy state of GSHb towards oxy hemoglobin like conformation. In the present study, we investigated the structural integrity and overall architecture of the quaternary structure of GSHb using native mass spectrometry and ion mobility mass spectrometry platforms. The dissociation equilibrium constants of both tetramer/dimer (K) and dimer/monomer equilibrium (K) was observed to increase by 1.91 folds and 3.64 folds respectively.

We examined the practice of TPN in our end of life cancer patients and we investigated the patient and tumor characteristics that justify this practice. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing TPN administration of Middle Eastern patients with advanced cancer.We conducted this retrospective observational study at Hotel-Dieu de France University Hospital, Lebanon. Eligible cases included all cancer patients that died at our institution between the 1st of January and the 31st of December 2014. The patients and tumors characteristics were analyzed for their potential role as determinant of TPN administration. The patients' hospitalization and causes of death were evaluated for the analysis of TPN benefits.Among the 129 patients enrolled, 39% had received TPN among which TPN administration correlated negatively to  (OR= 0.33; 95% CI [0.12-0.87]) and to the presence of at least three cardiovascular risk factors (OR= 0.28; 95% CI [0.10 - 0.80]). However, it correlated positively to gastrointestinal tumors (OR= 3.9; 95% CI [1.3- 11.7]) and to imaging studies during the last month of life (OR= 3.4; 95% CI [1.3 - 9.0]). The TPN administration did not correlate to hospitalization during the last two weeks of life.The adoption of an optimal palliative care approach in Middle Eastern cancer patients at the end of life remains challenging. Oncologists seem to consider cardiovascular risk factors as a probable surrogate to predict complications of TPN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630897>NAFLD and Atherosclerosis: Two Sides of the Same Dysmetabolic Coin?</a></h2><p>The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly increasing and may put patients at increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (asCVD). Both disease phenotypes often co-occur, in the case of obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus type 2, and the metabolic syndrome. We explore the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the epidemiology of asCVD in NAFLD patients, shared drivers of both phenotypes, and factors caused by NAFLD that contribute to asCVD. Genetic studies support that NAFLD may drive asCVD through mixed . Next, we discuss the prospects of lifestyle improvement and pharmacological treatment of NAFLD for asCVD risk reduction. Finally, we point out that earlier identification of patients with NAFLD should be pursued by increasing awareness of the association of these two phenotypes and collaboration between the involved physicians.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Insulin resistance is thought to be a pathogenic factor in women having PCOS along with increased incidence of metabolic disturbances.After obtaining ethical clearance, the girls of various colleges in Patiala were verbally sensitized to the symptoms of PCOS, and then given semistructured proformas subsequent to written informed consent. The students suspected on self-evaluation, and on evaluation of the proformas were investigated in the Out Patient Department, and patients reporting to Obstetrics and Gynecology Department with similar symptoms were also included after written informed consent. The patients were divided with simple randomization into two groups of 25 each. Group 1 (treatment group) was put on metformin therapy for three months (500 mg thrice a day), and Group 2 (control group) were given placebo thrice a day for the same duration. The patients were followed up after three months of metformin therapy (500 mg thrice a day) in Group 1, and placebo therapy in Group 2. Body weight, fasting blood glucose, blood glucose after 2 h of 75 g of glucose, and fasting serum insulin levels were assessed initially, and then after three months.The mean age of patients in the present study was 21.46 ± 4.45 years. About 54% patients in the present study had BMI ≥25 kg/m. About 68% of the patients had menstrual irregularity and PCO on ultrasonography (USG). About 44% patients in Group 1 (metformin) had increased insulin levels initially (>20 μU/ml), which were decreased to 16% after three months of metformin therapy. About 52% patients in Group 2 had increased insulin levels that were decreased to 48% after the placebo therapy.It has been concluded from this study that metformin significantly lowers insulin levels in patients with PCOS; in both obese and nonobese; which points towards its potential usefulness in treatment of PCOS patients, though it had no significant effect on body mass index in 12 weeks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520816>Formononetin alleviates hepatic steatosis by facilitating TFEB-mediated lysosome biogenesis and lipophagy.</a></h2><p>Formononetin has been reported to ameliorate  and obesity, but its effect and mechanism of action in anti-non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain unclear. Lipophagy is a critical protective mechanism during steatosis development that results in the decomposition of lipid droplets through autophagy and the prevention of cellular lipid accumulation. This study aimed to investigate the beneficial role of formononetin in treating NAFLD and explore the mechanism of lipophagy in formononetin anti-hepatic steatosis effects. Formononetin treatment significantly ameliorated hepatic steatosis in HFD mice. Consistently, formononetin also reduced FFAs-stimulated lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes. Further analysis revealed that steatosis increased LC3B-II, a marker of autophagy, but caused blockade of autophagic flux associated with a lack of lysosomes. Treatment with formononetin promoted lysosome biogenesis and autophagosome-lysosome fusion, relieving the blockade in autophagic flux and further induced lipophagy. Mechanistically, formononetin activated adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and promoted subsequent nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a key regulator of lysosome biogenesis. TFEB inhibition markedly abolished formononetin-induced lysosome biogenesis, autophagosome-lysosome fusion and lipophagy and concomitantly alleviated lipid accumulation. Formononetin improved hepatic steatosis via TFEB-mediated lysosome biogenesis, which provides new evidence regarding formononetin's anti-NAFLD effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Metabolism of tryptophan (Trp) via the kynurenine pathway has shown immunomodulatory properties and the ability to modulate atherosclerosis. We identified 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) as a key metabolite of Trp modulating vascular inflammation and lipid metabolism. The molecular mechanisms driven by 3-HAA in atherosclerosis have not been completely elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether two major signalling pathways, activation of SREBPs and inflammasome, are associated with the 3-HAA-dependent regulation of lipoprotein synthesis and inflammation in the atherogenesis process. Moreover, we examined whether inhibition of endogenous 3-HAA degradation affects  and atherosclerosis.In vitro, we showed that 3-HAA reduces SREBP-2 expression and nuclear translocation, and apolipoprotein B secretion in HepG2 cell cultures, and inhibits inflammasome activation and IL-1β production by macrophages. Using Ldlr-/- mice, we showed that inhibition of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), which increases the endogenous levels of 3-HAA, decreases atherosclerosis and plasma lipids. Notably, HAAO inhibition led to decreased hepatic SREBP-2 mRNA levels and lipid accumulation, and improved liver pathology scores.We discovered that the activity of SREBP-2 and the inflammasome can be regulated by 3-HAA metabolism. Moreover, our study highlights that targeting HAAO is a promising strategy to prevent and treat hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by maladaptive immune responses in the artery wall. Novel insights into cellular processes driving immune cell activation revealed that intracellular metabolic pathways regulate immune cell functions and inflammation. Thus, our present work identifies 3-Hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-Dioxygenase (HAAO) and promising immunometabolic target to combat atherosclerotic CVD. Importantly, our findings indicate targeting tryptophan metabolism offers the possibility affect both lipid metabolism and vascular inflammation in the course of disease. Our findings encourage further investigations that can lead to novel drugs to tested in humans in the near future.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, little is known regarding the role of these cells in maintaining metabolic homeostasis under metabolically normal conditions. In this study, we found that depletion of KCs in vivo led to enhanced lipolysis in adipose tissue by increasing the expression of FGF21, a metabolic regulator, in hepatocytes. IL-1β secreted from KCs contributed to the suppression of FGF21 expression in hepatocytes. FGF21 overexpression led to a lean phenotype and enhanced lipolysis in mice. KC depletion resulted in a lack of IL-1β signaling in the liver, leading to elevated expression of FGF21 in hepatocytes. FGF21 promoted lipolysis in adipose tissue and led to  and decreased body weight. The secretion of IL-1β in KCs was mediated by bacterial products. Antibiotic treatment also led to enhanced lipolysis. Therefore, the current study identified a physiological role of KCs in the regulation of adipose lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611326>Low total cholesterol is associated with increased major adverse cardiovascular events in men aged ≥70 years not taking statins.</a></h2><p>Low levels of total cholesterol (TC) are associated with adverse outcomes in older populations. Whether this phenomenon is independent of statin use is unknown. We investigated the association between low TC levels and long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a prospective study of men aged ≥70 years without ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and whether this was influenced by statin use.The CHAMP (Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project) cohort is a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling men aged ≥70 years. The relationship between TC and long-term MACE was analysed using Cox-regression modelling adjusted for comorbidities and stratified by statin use.The study cohort comprised 1289 men (mean (±SD) age, 77.0±5.5 years; mean follow-up, 6.4±2.7 years). Decreasing TC level was associated with increased comorbidity burden, frailty and MACE (linear trend p<0.001). In men not on statin therapy (n=731), each 1 mmol/L decrease in TC was associated with increased MACE (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.45, p=0.001) and mortality (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.44, p=0.02) adjusted for comorbidities. In contrast, low TC in men on statins (n=558) was not associated with MACE (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.11) or mortality (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09).Low TC is associated with increased risk of MACE in older men without IHD who are not taking statin therapy but not in those on statins.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Patients with CKD also develop other comorbidities, such as hypertension, , liver and cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal problems, and cognitive deterioration, which worsens their health. Therapy includes reducing comorbidities or using replacement therapy, such as peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and organ transplant. Health care systems are searching for alternative treatments for CKD patients to mitigate or retard their progression. One new topic is the study of uremic toxins (UT), which are excessively produced during CKD as products of food metabolism or as a result of the loss of renal function that have a negative impact on the kidneys and other organs. High urea concentrations significantly modify the microbiota in the gut also, cause a decrease in bacterial strains that produce anti-inflammatory and fuel molecules and an increase in bacterial strains that can metabolize urea, but also produce UT, including indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate. UT activates several cellular processes that induce oxidative environments, inflammation, proliferation, fibrosis development, and apoptosis; these processes mainly occur in the gut, heart, and kidney. The study of the microbiota during CKD allowed for the implementation of therapy schemes to try to reduce the circulating concentrations of UT and reduce the damage. The objective of this review is to show an overview to know the main UT produced in end-stage renal disease patients, and how prebiotics and probiotics intervention acts as a helpful tool in CKD treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575355>Impact of oral oncolytic initiation on medication adherence for pre-existing comorbid chronic conditions.</a></h2><p>Oral oncolytics have improved survival in hematological cancers like chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and multiple myeloma; however, it is unclear of the extent to which initiating these treatments might impact adherence to oral therapies for pre-existing comorbid chronic conditions.Adults diagnosed with and prescribed oral oncolytics for chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, or multiple myeloma between 2013 and 2016 and with continuous eligibility six months before and after oral oncolytic initiation were identified from the Truven Health MarketScan databases. Among those identified, patients with pre-existing diabetes, hypertension, and/or  with ≥1 fill for oral comorbid therapies were selected. Adherence to oral oncolytics and comorbid therapies was measured using the proportion of days covered metric. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests assessed changes in adherence for comorbid therapies after initiation of an oral oncolytic. Unadjusted difference-in-difference models assessed the impact of adherence to oral oncolytics on changes in adherence to comorbid therapies.Significant reductions in adherence after oncolytic initiation were observed across the comorbid therapies and were highest for patients taking lipid-lower agents (10.7-15.6%).

Statins are the first-line lipid-lowering drugs for this combined . However, it remains undetermined whether reduction of remnant lipoprotein mediates the relationship between improvement in endothelial dysfunction and reduction of LDL-C level after statin treatment.A total of 122 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with impaired flow-mediated dilation (FMD; <5.5%), high levels of LDL-C (≥100 mg/dL), and remnant-like lipoprotein particle cholesterol (RLP-C) (≥5 mg/dL) were examined in this study. The lipid profiles and FMD were measured before and after 6-9 months of statin treatment. The association between changes in LDL-C levels and its relationship with changes in FMD was investigated. Furthermore, mediation analysis was performed to assess the changes in RLP-C level as a mediator of the relationship between the reduction in LDL-C level and improvement of FMD.Treatment with statins improved FMD in 69 (56.5%) patients. Patients with improved FMD showed lower percent changes of LDL-C, triglyceride (TG), RLP-C, RLP-C/TG, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and higher percent change of HDL-C level, compared to patients who did not show improved FMD. The percent changes in FMD levels had a significant inverse correlation with the percent changes in LDL-C, (r = -0.18, p =  0.03), RLP-C (r = -0.39, p < 0.001), RLP-C/TG (r = -0.34, p < 0.001), and CRP (r = -0.27, p < 0.01).

Wistar rats ( = 48) were randomly divided into six groups: (1) normal diet rats (ND), (2) high-fat diet- (HFD-) treated rats, (3) HFD+fenofibrate-treated rats (HFD+FNB), (4) HFD+low dose of HAS-treated rats (HFD+LD, 9 mg/kg), (5) HFD+middle dose of HAS-treated rats (HFD+MD, 18 mg/kg), and (6) HFD+high dose of HAS-treated rats (HFD+HD, 36 mg/kg). The body weight and food intake of the rats were recorded during the treatment period. After 4 weeks of HAS treatment, abdominal adipose tissues were observed and total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) of serum and liver tissues were determined. Furthermore, histochemical examinations using oil red O and hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E) were carried out and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver were determined. After HFD feeding, the body weight gain and food efficiency ratio of HFD rats were significantly enhanced ( < 0.05 ND rats) and HAS treatment (18 and 36 mg/kg) significantly decreased the body weight gain and food efficiency ratio ( < 0.05 HFD rats). In addition, HAS treatment could decrease the abdominal adipose tissues and liver adipocytes. Furthermore, HAS treatment significantly decreased the T-CHO, TG, and LDL-C, whereas it increased HDL-C ( < 0.05 HFD rats) in serum and the liver. HAS treatment increased the GSH level and SOD activity in the liver ( < 0.05 HFD rats), whereas it decreased the levels of MDA ( < 0.05 HFD rats). mRNA analyses suggested that HAS treatment increases the expression of  (proliferator-activated receptor ) and  (peroxisome apolipoprotein E). Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting indicated that HAS stimulation increased the levels of PPAR and APOE in the liver, as a stress response of the body defense system.

The pathological features of DKD are the hypertrophy of mesangial cells, apoptosis of podocytes, glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening, accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), glomerular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The etiology of DKD is very complicated and many factors are involved, such as genetic factors, hyperglycemia, hypertension, , abnormalities of renal hemodynamics, and metabolism of vasoactive substances. Although some achievements have been made in the exploration of the pathogenesis of DKD, the currently available clinical treatment methods are still not completely effective in preventing the progress of DKD to ESRD. CHM composed of natural products has traditionally been used for symptom relief, which may offer new insights into therapeutic development of DKD. We will summarize the progress of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in the treatment of DKD from two aspects. In clinical trials, the Chinese herbal formulas were efficacy and safety confirmed by the randomized controlled trials. In terms of experimental research, studies provided evidence for the efficacy of CHM from the perspectives of balancing metabolic disorders, reducing inflammatory response and oxidative stress, antifibrosis, protecting renal innate cells, and regulating microRNA and metabolism.

The effect of dichloroacetate (DCA), a general pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor, on in vivo energy expenditure in ApoE mice fed a western diet (WD) has not yet been investigated. WD-fed ApoE mice developed atherosclerotic plaques and  along with obesity, which were significantly ameliorated by DCA administration. Increased oxygen consumption was associated with heat production in the DCA-treated group, with no change in food intake or physical activity compared with those of the control. These processes were correlated with the increased gene expression of Dio2 and Ucp-1, which represents brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation, in both WD-induced atherosclerosis and high-fat-induced obesity models. In addition, we found that DCA stimulated hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) mRNA expression, which might be important for lowering lipid levels and insulin sensitization via BAT activation, in a dose- and time-dependent manner associated with serum FGF21 levels. Interestingly, Fgf21 mRNA expression was mediated in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner within several minutes after DCA treatment independent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Taken together, the results suggest that enhanced glucose oxidation by DCA protects against atherosclerosis by inducing hepatic FGF21 expression and BAT activation, resulting in augmented energy expenditure for heat generation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533601>Dose HLA-B5, 7, 8, 27, and 51 antigens associate to behcet's disease?

T2DM is a risk factor of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, whether hIAPP in combination with  may lead to AD-like pathological changes in the brain remains unclear. hIAPP transgenic mice were fed with a high-fat diet for 6 or 12 months to establish the T2DM model. The accumulation of amylin, the numbers of Fluoro-Jade C (FJC)-positive and β-gal positive cells, and the deposition level of Aβ42 in the hippocampi of the transgenic mice were detected by using brain sections. Cytoplasmic and membrane proteins were extracted from the hippocampi of the transgenic mice, and the ratio of membrane GLUT4 expression to cytoplasmic GLUT4 expression was measured through Western blot analysis. Changes in the cognitive functions of hIAPP transgenic mice after 12 months of feeding with a high-fat diet were evaluated. hIAPP transgenic mice fed with a high-fat diet for 6 or 12 months showed elevated blood glucose levels and insulin resistance; increased amylin accumulation, number of FJC-positive and β-gal positive cells, and Aβ42 deposition in the hippocampi; and reduced membrane GLUT4 expression levels. hIAPP transgenic mice fed with a high-fat diet for 12 months showed reductions in social cognitive ability and passive learning ability.

Promoting the browning of white adipose tissue has been suggested as a potential strategy, but a drug still needs to be identified. Here, genetic deletion of activating transcription factor 3 (  ) in mice under a high-fat diet (HFD) resulted in obesity and insulin resistance, which was abrogated by virus-mediated ATF3 restoration. ST32da, a synthetic ATF3 inducer isolated from , promoted ATF3 expression to downregulate adipokine genes and induce adipocyte browning by suppressing the carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 axis. Furthermore, ST32da increased white adipose tissue browning and reduced lipogenesis in HFD-induced obese mice. The anti-obesity efficacy of oral ST32da administration was similar to that of the clinical drug orlistat.

The surgeon had 20 years of experience in this field and he had performed over 5000 major laparoscopic bariatric procedures before starting this new bariatric program. The concept of enhanced recovery after bariatric surgery (ERABS) was applied from the beginning of the program. We decided to analyze the first 2 years of ERAS activity after having split them in two different periods: the 1st year of activity included restrictive procedures and the 2nd year associated malabsorptive surgeries.  The results of the use of a fast-track program could be measured by different parameters like operative time, length of hospital stay, rate of complications, and rate of readmission and reoperation.  Between January and December 2015, 116 patients underwent a bariatric procedure. The mean age was 34.6 years (16-61) and average body mass index (BMI) was 41.7 kg/sqm (32-72.2). Sixty percent of patients were women and 37% of patients had at least one comorbidity (diabetes type 2, high blood pressure, , or sleep apnea). Ninety-four percent of the procedures were laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), 2.6% were laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 3.4% band removal. The mean operative time was 20 minutes for an LSG (14-45 minutes) and the average hospital stay was 1.2 days (standard deviation [SD]: 0.9-3.3). The rate of complications was 1.7% with 1 postoperative hematoma drained by CT scan on day 14 after the surgery and 1 relative stenosis endoscopically dilated on postoperative day 45. No reoperation was done. No leak was observed. At 1 year, the mean excess weight loss (EWL) was 64% (47-124) in 89 patients with a 76% rate of follow-up. For the 2nd year of activity in 2016, 142 patients went in the program. The mean age was 32.7 years (17-64) and average BMI was 42.3 kg/sqm (31-68). Seventy-two percent were women and 41% of the patients had one comorbidity or more. The majority of surgeries performed were LSG for 83.1% of the patients. RYGB was realized in 4.2% of cases, resleeve gastrectomy in 4.2%, and band removal in 1.4%. Some malabsorptive surgeries were performed as well, such as one anastomosis gastric bypass for 3 patients (4.2%), and single anastomosis duodeno-ilelal in 2 cases (2.8%). The average hospital stay was 1.5 days (SD: 0.9-3.5). No complication was observed. No reoperation was done. Two patients (1.4%) came back to the hospital on postoperative day 2 and 8 after a LSG for one or several episodes of vomiting without further complication. At 1 year, the mean EWL was 68% (49-154) in 98 patients with a 69% rate of follow-up.  This new program of bariatric surgery in two steps using fast-track protocols, respecting international guidelines and with an experienced surgeon showed on its 1st year of implementation a 1.7% rate of readmission on 116 patients without reoperation or major complication and a hospital stay of 1.2 days.

This study was designed to assess the effect of date seed powder on lipid profile of diet induced hyperlipidemic rabbits.Thirty male rabbits were divided into five groups, having six animals in each. One group was given normal rabbit chow throughout the study period of eight weeks. The remaining four groups were fed high fat diet (4% coconut oil and 1% cholesterol powder) for first four weeks in order to induce . After first four weeks, 2% date seed powder of three Pakistani varieties namely Dhakki, Khudrawi and Desi was added to the diet of three experimental hyperlipidemic groups for the next four weeks. Body weight and blood samples were taken at zero, 4th and 8th week of study. Serum was analyzed for total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and serum triglycerides. LDL/HDL ratio and AIP were calculated.It was observed that date seed powder of the three varieties significantly decreased total cholesterol, serum triglycerides and AIP. There was no significant change in body weight, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL/HDL ratio. LDL cholesterol was decreased significantly only by Khudrawi date seed powder.It was concluded that date seed powder has marked antihyperlipidemic properties.

Macular and peripapillary SD-OCT measurements (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), DM duration, HbA1c levels and presence of HT and/or HL were used for statistical analyses.The MA (+), MA (-) and control groups had similar age and gender distribution (p > 0.05). The differences in SD-OCT measurements among the MA (+), MA (-) and control groups were insignificant (p > 0.05). However, diabetic patients (n = 95) had significantly thinner inferior-temporal peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) (p = 0.042) than in the controls (n = 91). Superior peripapillary RNFL was significantly thinner in patients with an HbA1c level > 7% (p = 0.049). However, 3 mm-nasal, temporal and superior perifoveal thicknesses were significantly lower in patients with DM duration over 10 years (p < 0.05). HT and/or HL coexistence did not lead a significant difference in SD-OCT parameters among the groups.In diabetic patients without DR, peripapillary inferior-temporal RNFL thinning might be an early sign of neuroretinal degeneration and it seems to be independent from vascular endothelial damage (MA). Poor metabolic control appears to lead superior peripapillary RNFL thinning, while perifoveal thicknesses tend to decrease with longer DM duration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582390>Placement of a Stent within a Flow Diverter Improves Aneurysm Occlusion Rates.</a></h2><p>Placement of a stent within a flow diverter has been described previously but its consequences have not been analyzed. We evaluated the clinical and angiographic results of stent placement within a flow diverter during the same treatment session.All patients treated with a Surpass flow diverter were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with previously deployed stents and procedures in which scaffolding stents, a second flow diverter, or intrasaccular devices were used were excluded. Patient and aneurysm characteristics and clinical and imaging follow-up results were compared between stented and nonstented Surpass flow-diverter groups and stent assisted coiling.Thirty-five patients (41 aneurysms) were treated with a Surpass flow diverter only (monotherapy group), and in 33 patients (35 aneurysms), a stent was placed within the Surpass flow diverter (stented group). Stents were placed inside the Surpass flow diverter for a variety of reasons at the operator's discretion. No statistical difference was noted between the 2 groups in age, body weight, sex, history of thromboembolic events, smoking, platelet inhibition levels, hypertension, , diabetes mellitus, malignancy, and aneurysm location. Aneurysms in the stented group were larger than those in the monotherapy group (14.8 versus 9.1 mm,  < .001). The rate of clinically significant adverse events and complete aneurysm occlusion rates at 0-3 and 3-6 months (73.3% versus 61.3%,  = .31, and 84.8% versus 70.2%,  = .14) were similar. At 9-12 months, a significantly higher proportion of aneurysms in the stented group achieved complete occlusion (93.9% versus 73.2%,  = .019). There was a trend toward a higher obliteration rate on final follow-up in the stented group (93.9% versus 82.9%,  = .14).Placement of a stent within a flow diverter increases the rate of aneurysm occlusion. We propose that these results are from improved flow-diverter apposition due to the higher radial force of intracranial stents.© 2019 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601586>Association of gout and colorectal cancer in Taiwan: a nationwide population-based cohort study.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine colorectal cancer (CRC) risks among patients with gout through a follow-up study on a nationwide population-based cohort that included patients with gout and the general population in Taiwan.From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 28 061 patients who were newly diagnosed with gout between 2000 and 2010 as the study cohort. We randomly selected 84 248 subjects matching in gender, age and baseline year as comparison cohort. The cohorts were followed up until CRC occurrence, withdrawal from the system of National Health Insurance, or Dec. 31, 2013.Cumulative incidences and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of CRC between two cohorts were examined. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate risk factors associated with CRC development.During the 13-year follow-up, the incidence rate of CRC development in the gout cohort reached 2.44 per 1000 person-years, which was higher than the 2.13 per 1000 person-years in the control cohort (IRR=1.15; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.26). After adjusting for age, gender, urbanisation status and comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes and , gout showed no significant association with increased risk of CRC occurrence (adjusted HR=1.03; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14).Similar risks of CRC incidence were observed in patients with and without gout in Taiwan. Allopurinol and colchicine are commonly used as urate-lowering drug and anti-inflammation medication in Taiwan and had been shown to reduce the risk of CRC incidence. Thus, further pharmaco-epidemiological studies should be carried out to specifically assess the role of allopurinol in the relationship between gout and CRC.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Given their substantial contribution towards the escalating costs of health care, they also generate a high socio-economic burden in the general population. The underlying pathogenesis and progression associated with nearly all CVDs is predominantly of atherosclerotic origin that leads to the development of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, venous thromboembolism and, peripheral vascular disease, subsequently causing myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias or stroke. The aetiological risk factors leading to the onset of CVDs are well recognized and include , hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking and, lack of physical activity. They collectively represent more than 90% of the CVD risks in all epidemiological studies. Despite the critical fatality rate of CVDs, the identification and careful prevention of the underlying risk factors can significantly reduce the global epidemic of CVDs. Primary regimes for the prevention and treatment of CVDs include lipid-lowering drugs, antihypertensives, antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies. Despite their effectiveness, significant gaps in the treatment of CVDs remain. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology and pathology of the major CVDs that are prevalent globally. We also determine the contribution of well-recognized risk factors towards the development of CVDs and the prevention strategies.

In the present study, we hence investigated the associations between WMH volumes and cognitive function, blood levels of various molecules, and the presence of lifestyle-associated diseases in patients with amnestic MCI.The initial data of 38 patients with amnestic MCI and 10 normal control individuals were analyzed. The volumes of periventricular hyperintensities (PVH) and deep WMH (DWMH) were measured on T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery using the imaging software, 3D Slicer; and the association between PVH/DWMH volumes and cognitive function, blood levels of molecules (such as cystatin C [CysC], 25-hydroxyvitamin D and homocysteine) and the presence of lifestyle-associated diseases (such as hypertension,  and diabetes mellitus) were analyzed.In the MCI group, the PVH volume : intracranial volume ratio significantly correlated with Trail Making Test-A/B scores and CysC level by Pearson's analysis, and the PVH volume : intracranial volume ratio significantly correlated with only CysC levels, whereas the DWMH volume : intracranial volume ratio did not correlate with any items at all by linear multiple regression analysis.PVH volume was closely associated with frontal lobe dysfunction, particularly with attention and executive dysfunction. Serum CysC level was associated with PVH volume, which suggests that CysC might be a useful marker for determining treatment strategies for white matter abnormalities in amnestic MCI.

Use was defined as a mammogram within the previous 1 or 2 years, analyzed separately. A logit model was employed to evaluate associations between use and comorbidities and age. Statistical significance was defined by a P value < .05 by two-sided test.Of the 36,575 women in our study sample, 45.9%, 43.6%, 3.9%, and 5.7% reported a history of hypertension (HTN),  (HLD), prior heart attack (MI), and prior stroke, respectively. Among women without a comorbid condition, there was 47.3% annual mammography use. HTN and HLD were associated with increased use (2.5 and 6.8 percentage points [pp], P< .01). In comparison, prior MI was associated with decreased annual use (-8.2 pp, P < .01). Prior stroke was not significantly associated with annual mammography (-1.5 pp, P = .42). Results were similar for biennial use. The age trend in use showed that the age with maximum screening use was approximately 60 years.Mammography use was higher in patients with HTN and HLD, and lower in patients with prior MI and stroke, which may reflect differences in comorbidity-related general health care use. Use increased until it peaked around age 60. An understanding of how mammography use naturally evolves as people age may help better target specific populations and improve overall use of preventive care.Copyright © 2019 American College of Radiology.

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile acids (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic acid, activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti- therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559554>Statin use, , and risk of glioma.</a></h2><p>Background Statins have previously been shown to have protective effects for other cancers, but no prospective studies of statin use and glioma have been conducted. Methods We evaluated the association between statin use and risk of glioma in the female Nurses' Health Study (NHS, n = 114,419) and Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII, n = 115,813) and the male Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, n = 50,223). Glioma cases were confirmed by medical record review. Age and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of glioma by statin use were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results In 4,430,700 person-years of follow-up, we confirmed 483 incident cases of glioma. Compared with never-users, ever statin use was associated with borderline increased risk of glioma in the combined cohorts (age-adjusted HR = 1.23, 95% CI 0.99-1.54), as was longer duration of statin use (HR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.08-2.03 comparing > 8 years of use to never use, p-trend = 0.01). We also observed a significant inverse association between  and glioma in multivariable models (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.59-0.93 in combined cohorts), which was attenuated in lagged analyses. Compared to never use, in multivariable-adjusted models, ever statin use (HR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.10-1.86) and statin use duration (HR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.21-2.45, for > 8 years of use, p-trend = 0.003) were each significantly associated with increased glioma risk. Conclusion In contrast to case-control studies reporting inverse associations, we found borderline increased risk of glioma with statin use. Results were strengthened after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors due to an unexpected inverse association between  and glioma risk.

The favorable metabolic effects of this diet were assessed in non-pregnant population but its impact during pregnancy remains to be evaluated.A retrospective cohort study comparing two groups. Group A comprised of women with singleton low-risk pregnancy adherent to paleolithic diet throughout gestation (n = 37). Group B comprised low risk pregnant women on a regular diet (n = 39). Women were excluded if they had low adherence to diet, started paleolithic diet during pregnancy, and had pre-gestational diabetes mellitus or other types of metabolic syndrome such as pre gestational , hypertension or BMI > 35. Blood indices such as Glucose challenge test scores, hemoglobin, ferritin, and TSH levels were compared. Other pregnancy factors such as maternal weight gain, rest days during gestation and pregnancy complications such as IUGR, GDM or preeclampsia were compared. Lastly, obstetrical outcomes such as mode of delivery and complications such as high-grade tears, as well as neonatal factors such as birth weight and pH were compared between the two groups.General maternal characteristics such as age, BMI and parity were comparable between the two groups. Women who maintained a paleolithic diet had a significant decrease in glucose challenge test scores (95.8 mg/dL vs. 123.1 mg/dL, p < 0.01) and increase in hemoglobin levels (12.1 g/dL vs. 11.05 g/dL p < 0.01) and Ferritin (32.1 vs 21.3 mg/mL, p = 0.03) compared to women maintaining regular diet. Maternal pregnancy weight gain was also slightly decreased in group A (9.3Kg vs. 10.8 kg, p = 0.03). Birthweights were lower in group A (3098 g Vs.3275 g, p = 0.046) with no difference in adverse neonatal outcomes. We found no differences in other pregnancy complications or labor outcomes such as mode of delivery, shoulder dystocia or high grade perineal tears.Paleolithic diet maintained during pregnancy may have a beneficial effect on the glucose tolerance. It also may increase iron stores and hemoglobin levels. Neonates of women maintaining paleolithic diet are slightly lighter but appropriate for gestational age with no difference in neonatal outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Disturbance in the human gut microbiota is now considered a critical factor in the atherosclerosis. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) attracts attention and is regarded as a vital contributor in the development of atherosclerosis. TMAO is generated from its dietary precursors choline, carnitine, and phosphatidylcholine by gut microbiota into an intermediate compound known as trimethylamine (TMA), which is then oxidized into TMAO by hepatic flavin monooxygenases. The present review focus on advances in TMAO preventing strategies through probiotics, including, modulation of gut microbiome, metabolomics profile, miRNA, or probiotic antagonistic abilities.

This study was aimed to determine the effect of standardised 80% ethanol extract of GP on lipid profiles and oxidative status of hypercholesterolemic rats. Postmenopausal (PM) Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomised and fed with 2% cholesterol diet fortified with five times heated palm oil to develop  status. Two doses of the extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) and atorvastatin (10 mg/kg) were administered once daily via oral gavage for 24 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was increased during the first month in the postmenopausal group and decreased with GP supplementation. Lipid droplets accumulation was shown at the tunica media (TM) area of the aorta in the postmenopausal group and reduced with GP supplementation. Total cholesterol (TC), total triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased ( < 0.05) at 3 and 6 months in the postmenopausal group and were reduced with GP supplementation. GP also increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level in the postmenopausal group. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were reduced in the postmenopausal group compared to control in the sham group but increased ( < 0.05) with GP supplementation. The results showed that the higher dose of GP (500 mg/kg) gave better effect.

This was a prospective observational study to examine outcomes of intravenous thrombolysis-treated stroke patients in the MENA region compared to the non-MENA stroke cohort in the SITS International Registry.Of 32,160 patients with ischemic stroke registered using the SITS intravenous thrombolysis protocol between June 2014 and May 2016, 500 (1.6%) were recruited in MENA. Compared to non-MENA (all  < 0.001), median age in MENA was 55 versus 73 years, NIH Stroke Scale score 12 versus 9, onset-to-treatment time 138 versus 155 min and door-to-needle time 54 min versus 64 min. Hypertension was the most reported risk factor, but lower in MENA (51.7 vs. 69.7%). Diabetes was more frequent in MENA (28.5 vs. 20.8%) as well as smoking (20.8 vs. 15.9%).  was less observed in MENA (17.6 vs. 29.3%). Functional independence (mRS 0-2) at seven days or discharge was similar (53% vs. 52% in non-MENA), with mortality slightly lower in MENA (2.3% vs. 4.8%). SICH rates by SITS-MOST definition were low (<1.4%) in both groups.Intravenous thrombolysis patients in MENA were younger, had more severe strokes and more often diabetes. Although stroke severity was higher in MENA, short-term functional independency and mortality were not worse compared to non-MENA, which could partly be explained by younger age and shorter OTT in MENA.
