Oral administration of  significantly reversed high-fructose diet-mediated increase in body mass index and blood glucose. Furthermore,  restored high-fructose diet-mediated alterations in metabolic hormones (insulin, leptin and adiponectin). -mediated upregulation of protein kinase B (Akt) and phosphoinositde-3 kinase (PI3K) anulled high-fructose diet mediated depletion. Also, elevated tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and -8 were significantly lowered. Administration of  restored high-fructose diet-mediated increase in the levels of lipid profile parameters and indices of atherosclerosis, cardiac and cardiovascular diseases. High-fructose diet-mediated decrease in activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and increase in oxidative stress biomarkers (reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation products, protein oxidation and fragmented DNA) were significantly restored by the phenolic acids. Conclusively,  improves insulin sensitivity, elevated blood glucose, inflammation and dyslipidaemia and oxidative stress in high-fructose diet-induced metabolic syndrome through the PI#Kand Akt pathways .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27894808>Protective effect of  on early atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein-E gene knockout mice.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerosis, a chronic and progressive disease, is a leading cause of endothelial dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.  (BA), a pentacyclic triterpene, has been reported to have a variety of biological effects, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This study was designed to determine whether BA could prevent atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein-E gene knockout (ApoE KO) mice. The mice were treated with BA for 12 weeks to examine its beneficial effects on atherosclerosis in ApoE KO mice. Male ApoE KO mice and age-matched control group mice (C57BL/6Jms) were used as experimental systems and their systolic blood pressure, insulin resistance, and vascular inflammation were measured. BA-treated ApoE KO mice showed lowered systolic blood pressure. The metabolic parameter showed that BA decreased blood urea nitrogen, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels. Blood glucose, insulin, glucose tolerance results, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index were found to be better in BA-treated ApoE KO mice than untreated ApoE KO mice. Consistent with the change in lipid profiles, oil red O and H&E staining revealed that treatment with BA reduced atherosclerotic lesions such as roughened endothelial layers. BA ameliorated the reduction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, leading to the inhibition of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and endothelin 1 (ET-1) expression. These results suggest that BA may be useful in the treatment and prevention of early atherosclerosis via the attenuation of endothelial dysfunction in diabetic ApoE KO mice.Copyright © 2017.
