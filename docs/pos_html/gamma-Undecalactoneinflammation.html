Free radicals present in e-cigarette aerosols have been shown to induce oxidative stress resulting in damage to proliferation, survival, and  pathways in the cell. Aerosols generated from e-liquid solvents alone contain high levels of free radicals but few studies have looked at how these toxins are modulated by flavorants.We investigated the effects of different flavorants on free radical production in e-cigarette aerosols.Free radicals generated from 49 commercially available e-liquid flavors were captured and analyzed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The flavorant composition of each e-liquid was analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS). Radical production was correlated with flavorant abundance. Ten compounds were identified and analyzed for their impact on free radical generation.Nearly half of the flavors modulated free radical generation. Flavorants with strong correlations included β-damascone, δ-tetradecalactone, γ-decalactone, citral, dipentene, ethyl maltol, ethyl vanillin, ethyl vanillin PG acetal, linalool, and piperonal. Dipentene, ethyl maltol, citral, linalool, and piperonal promoted radical formation in a concentration-dependent manner. Ethyl vanillin inhibited the radical formation in a concentration dependent manner. Free radical production was closely linked with the capacity to oxidize biologically-relevant lipids.Our results suggest that flavoring agents play an important role in either enhancing or inhibiting the production of free radicals in flavored e-cigarette aerosols. This information is important for developing regulatory strategies aimed at reducing potential harm from e-cigarettes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

They catalyze the hydrolysis of epoxide containing lipids and are involved in crucial mechanisms, such as the detoxification of xenobiotics or the regulation of  and blood pressure. Here, we describe a function of a putative EH gene in the biosynthesis of a sex attractant in the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis and use this gene to localize the site of pheromone production. Males of this parasitic wasp release a mixture of (4R,5R)-( threo-) and (4R,5S)-( erythro-)5-hydroxy-4-decanolide (HDL) to attract virgin females. Using a stable isotope labeled precursor, we demonstrated that vernolic acid ( erythro-12,13-epoxy-octadec-9Z-enoic acid) is converted by N. vitripennis males to threo-HDL. This suggested the involvement of an EH in hydrolyzing the fatty acid epoxide under inversion of the stereochemistry into the respective diol, which might be further processed by chain shortening and lactonization to HDL. We cloned a putative N. vitripennis EH gene (Nasvi-EH1) encoding 470 amino acids and localized its transcripts in the male rectal papillae by in situ RT-PCR. Chemical analyses and histological studies confirmed that males synthesize the sex attractant in the rectal vesicle and release it via the anal orifice. Involvement of Nasvi-EH1 in HDL biosynthesis was established by RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Injection of Nasvi-EH1 dsRNA into male abdomens inhibited pheromone biosynthesis by 55% and suppressed the targeted gene transcripts in the rectal vesicle by 95%.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578432>Yarrowia lipolytica: a beneficious yeast in biotechnology as a rare opportunistic fungal pathogen: a minireview.</a></h1><p>Yarrowia lipolytica is one of the most studied "non-conventional" yeast species capable of synthesizing a wide group of valuable metabolites, in particular lipases and other hydrolytic enzymes, microbial oil, citric acid, erythritol and γ-decalactone. Processes based on the yeast have GRAS status ("generally recognized as safe") given by Food and Drug Administration. The majority of research communications regarding to Y. lipolytica claim that the yeast species is non-pathogenic. In spite of that, Y. lipolytica, like other fungal species, can cause infections in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. The yeast possess features that facilitate invasion of the host cell (particularly production of hydrolytic enzymes), as well as the protection of the own cells, such as biofilm formation. The aim of this study was to present well-known yeast species Y. lipolytica as a rare opportunistic fungal pathogen. Possible pathogenicity and epidemiology of this yeast species were discussed. Antifungal drugs susceptibility and increasing resistance to azoles in Y. lipolytica yeasts were also presented.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012990>Gamma-decanolactone inhibits iNOS and TNF-alpha production by lipopolysaccharide-activated microglia in N9 cells.</a></h1><p>Activated microglia that produce reactive nitrogen species (RNS), inflammatory factors, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and other neurovirulent factors may lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Certain compounds can inhibit the activation of microglia. However, these mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of Gamma-decanolactone (GD) on the production of reactive oxygen species and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - stimulated N9 murine microglial cells through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. The results showed that GD attenuated the activation of N9 cells and inhibited intracellular reactive oxygen species and the expression of iNOS and TNF-α induced by LPS in the cells. In addition, GD blocked the phosphorylation of p38 and inhibited cleaved caspase-9 and DNA damage. These data indicate that GD has therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and that it exerts its effects by inhibiting .Copyright © 2016.
