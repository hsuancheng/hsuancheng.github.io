A total of 24 pens provided 12 replicates per treatment. Animals were weighed on day 0 and 28 with feed and water intake recorded per pen. After 31 days supplementation (28 days of study and 3 days until the slaughtering date) three animals per pen (n = 72) were slaughtered and the LL and backfat thickness, lean meat content and dressing percentage were recorded for the carcasses. The fatty  (FA) profile of the LL and backfat was established by direct FA   synthesis.No differences were observed for any performance parameters or carcass traits. Supplementation with AURA resulted in significant changes to the FA profiles of both the LL and backfat with male and female pigs responding differently to supplementation in terms of particular FAs. Overall, pork LL samples had significantly higher eicosapentaenoic  (p<0.001) and DHA concentrations (p<0.001), and higher omega-3 (n-3) FAs (p<0.001), as well as an increased omega3:omega6 (n-3:n-6) ratio (p = 0.001). For backfat, supplementation resulted in significantly higher amounts of DHA (p<0.001) and n-3 FAs (p<0.001).These results indicate that dietary supplementation with 1% AURA over a 31 day period can increase the FA composition of pork LL and backfat, specifically the DHA, with no major impact on growth performance and carcass traits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29949439>Losing Reproduction: Effect of High Temperature on Female Biochemical Composition and Egg Quality in a Freshwater Crustacean with Direct Development, the Red Cherry Shrimp, Neocaridina davidi (Decapoda, Atyidae).</a></h2><p>Maternal provisioning is particularly important in invertebrates with abbreviated development because large  reserves must be provided for the developing embryo. In this context, the objective of the present study was to analyze in an aquatic invertebrate with direct development the effect of temperature on female biochemical composition and reserve allocation to maturing ovaries, which determine egg quality. A decapod crustacean, the freshwater shrimp Neocaridina davidi, was used as experimental model. Newly hatched juveniles were exposed to 28 °C or 33 °C. Females showed mature ovaries and spawned at 28 °C (control ovigerous females), but no ovigerous female was found at 33 °C. After a 200-day period, half of the females at 33 °C were transferred to 28 °C, where they rapidly showed mature ovaries and spawned (transferred ovigerous females). Ovigerous females and females that did not spawn at 28 °C (control non-ovigerous females) and at 33 °C (high-temperature non-ovigerous females) were sacrificed to determine their biochemical composition. The number, volume, weight, and biochemical composition of the eggs from transferred and control ovigerous females were also analyzed as indicators of their quality. Female biochemical composition was not influenced by temperature, because control and high-temperature non-ovigerous females had similar lipid, protein, and glycogen contents. However, ovarian maturation and spawning were inhibited at 33 °C, which indicates a negative effect of this temperature on nutrient transfer to the oocytes. This effect was rapidly reversed after females were moved to 28 °C; the eggs from control and transferred ovigerous females were of similar quality, except for a lower protein content in the latter. The present results provide valuable information on reserve allocation to reproduction under thermal stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26802939>Supplementation of maternal omega-3 fatty acids to pregnancy induced hypertension Wistar rats improves IL10 and VEGF levels.</a></h2><p>Our recent study demonstrates the beneficial effect of a combined supplementation of vitamin B12, folic , and   in reducing the severity of pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH). It is also known to be associated with angiogenic imbalance and inflammation. The current study examines whether the individual/combined supplementation of folic , vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty  during pregnancy can ameliorate the inflammatory markers and restore the angiogenic balance in a rat model of PIH.There were total of six groups, control and five treatment groups: PIH Induced; PIH+vitamin B12; PIH+folic ; PIH+Omega-3 fatty acids and PIH+combined micronutrient supplementation (vitamin B12+folic +omega-3 fatty acids). Hypertension during pregnancy was induced using L- Nitroarginine methylester (L-NAME; 50mg/kg body weight/day). Dams were dissected at d20 of gestation and placental tissues were collected for further analysis.Animals from the PIH induced group demonstrated lower (p<0.01 for both) IL-10 and VEGF levels as compared to control. However, PIH induction did not alter the protein levels of eNOS, IL-6, Flt and mRNA levels of VEGF and VEGFR-1/ Flt-1. Individual micronutrient supplementation of vitamin B12 and folate did not offer benefit. In contrast individual omega-3 fatty  as well as combined micronutrient supplementation showed IL-10 and VEGF levels comparable to that of control.Omega 3 fatty  supplementation plays a key role in reducing inflammation in pregnancy induced hypertension.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
