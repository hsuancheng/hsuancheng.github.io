Therefore, we evaluated whether dietary ALA would decrease the expression of adhesion molecules by inducing the protective enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in a rat  model. was induced at day 0 by an intrarectal injection of 2-4-6-trinitrobenzen sulfonic  (TNBS), whereas control rats received the vehicle. Rats were fed an ALA-rich formula 450 mg · kg⁻¹ · d⁻¹, whereas the other colitic group (TNBS) and the control group were fed an isocaloric corn oil formula for 14 d (from day -7 to day 7). The colonic expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), vascular endothelial growth factor A receptor-2 (VEGFR2), and HO-1 were studied by immunohistochemistry.The ALA-rich diet significantly decreased the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and VEGFR-2 compared the TNBS group, but it did not affect the expression of HO-1.A vegetal ALA-rich formula decreases the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and VEGFR-2 and independently of HO-1 in rats with TNBS-induced . Further studies are required to evaluate its therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease as an alternative to fish oil.Copyright © 2012.

However, no tightly controlled studies using high-fat diets differing in the n-6:n-3 have tested this hypothesis. The aim of the study was to determine the role that the dietary n-6:n-3 plays in non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD) and colitis development. We hypothesized that reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 would hinder the development of NAFLD and colitis. Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed high-fat diets, differing in the n-6:n-3 (1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1), for 20 weeks. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the hepatic phospholipid arachidonic  (AA):eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic . Hepatic metabolism, inflammatory signaling, macrophage polarization, gene expression of inflammatory mediators, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and oxidative capacity were assessed as well as colonic inflammatory signaling, and gene expression of inflammatory mediators and tight-junction proteins. Although reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 lowered the hepatic phospholipid AA:eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic  in a dose-dependent manner and mildly influenced inflammatory signaling, it did not significantly attenuate NAFLD development. Furthermore, the onset of NAFLD was not paired to colitis development or changes in tight-junction protein gene expression. In conclusion, reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 did not attenuate NAFLD progression; nor is it likely that colitis, or gut permeability, plays a role in NAFLD initiation in this model.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The expression of PPARγ and δ, their responsive genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines was assayed in the colonic mucosa. Immune cell-specific PPARγ null, PPARδ knockout and wild-type mice were treated with PUA and challenged with 2·5 % dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). The prophylactic efficacy of PUA was examined in an IL-10(-/-) model of IBD. The effect of PUA on the regulatory T-cell (Treg) compartment was also examined in mice with experimental IBD. PUA ameliorated spontaneous pan-enteritis in IL-10(-/-) mice and DSS , up-regulated Foxp3 expression in Treg and suppressed TNF-α, but the loss of functional PPARγ or δ impaired these anti-inflammatory effects. At the cellular level, the macrophage-specific deletion of PPARγ caused a complete abrogation of the protective effect of PUA, whereas the deletion of PPARδ or intestinal epithelial cell-specific PPARγ decreased its anti-inflammatory efficacy. We provide in vivo molecular evidence demonstrating that PUA ameliorates experimental IBD by regulating macrophage and T-cell function through PPARγ- and δ-dependent mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23426968>Inhibitory effects of omega-3 fatty acids on injury-induced epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation contribute to delayed wound healing.</a></h2><p>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated signaling is required for optimal intestinal wound healing. Since n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), specifically docosahexaenoic  (DHA), alter EGFR signaling and suppress downstream activation of key signaling pathways, we hypothesized that DHA would be detrimental to the process of intestinal wound healing. Using a mouse immortalized colonocyte model, DHA uniquely reduced EGFR ligand-induced receptor activation, whereas DHA and its metabolic precursor eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) reduced wound-induced EGFR transactivation compared with control (no fatty  or linoleic ). Under wounding conditions, the suppression of EGFR activation was associated with a reduction in downstream activation of cytoskeletal remodeling proteins (PLCγ1, Rac1, and Cdc42). Subsequently, DHA and EPA reduced cell migration in response to wounding. Mice were fed a corn oil-, DHA-, or EPA-enriched diet prior to intestinal wounding (2.5% dextran sodium sulfate for 5 days followed by termination after 0, 3, or 6 days of recovery). Mortality was increased in EPA-fed mice and colonic histological injury scores were increased in EPA- and DHA-fed mice compared with corn oil-fed (control) mice. Although kinetics of colonic EGFR activation and downstream signaling (PLCγ1, Rac1, and Cdc42) were delayed by both n-3 PUFA, colonic repair was increased in EPA- relative to DHA-fed mice. These results indicate that, during the early response to intestinal wounding, DHA and EPA uniquely delay the activation of key wound-healing processes in the colon. This effect is mediated, at least in part, via suppression of EGFR-mediated signaling and downstream cytoskeletal remodeling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763556>Dietary flaxseed intake exacerbates acute colonic mucosal injury and inflammation induced by dextran sodium sulfate.</a></h2><p>Flaxseed (FS), a dietary oilseed, contains a variety of anti-inflammatory bioactives, including fermentable fiber, phenolic compounds (lignans), and the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) α-. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of FS and its n-3 PUFA-rich kernel or lignan- and soluble fiber-rich hull on  severity in a mouse model of acute colonic inflammation. C57BL/6 male mice were fed a basal diet (negative control) or a basal diet supplemented with 10% FS, 6% kernel, or 4% hull for 3 wk prior to and during  induction via 5 days of 2% (wt/vol) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in their drinking water (n = 12/group). An increase in anti-inflammatory metabolites (hepatic n-3 PUFAs, serum mammalian lignans, and cecal short-chain fatty acids) was associated with consumption of all FS-based diets, but not with anti-inflammatory effects in DSS-exposed mice. Dietary FS exacerbated DSS-induced acute , as indicated by a heightened disease activity index and an increase in colonic injury and inflammatory biomarkers [histological damage, apoptosis, myeloperoxidase, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1β), and NF-κB signaling-related genes (Nfkb1, Ccl5, Bcl2a1a, Egfr, Relb, Birc3, and Atf1)]. Additionally, the adverse effect of the FS diet was extended systemically, as serum cytokines (IL-6, IFNγ, and IL-1β) and hepatic cholesterol levels were increased. The adverse effects of FS were not associated with alterations in fecal microbial load or systemic bacterial translocation (endotoxemia). Collectively, this study demonstrates that although consumption of a 10% FS diet enhanced the levels of n-3 PUFAs, short-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and lignans in mice, it exacerbated DSS-induced colonic injury and inflammation.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11173900>Effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E on colonic mucosal leukotriene generation, lipid peroxidation, and microcirculation in rats with experimental .</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on mucosal levels of leukotrienes (LTs) and lipid peroxide (LPO), and on mucosal microcirculation, in rats with experimental  induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).We fed Wistar rats a perilla oil-enriched diet containing  (63.2% of total fatty acids) with various doses of vitamin E for 4 weeks, with 4% DSS added to the drinking water during the last week. Control rats were fed a diet produced from soybean oil containing  (5.1% of total fatty acids). Colonic mucosal blood flow was measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter.The mucosal level of arachidonic  was significantly lower and that of eicosapentaenoic  was significantly higher in the experimental group. The mucosal level of LPO in the experimental group fed a trace or ordinary dose of vitamin E was significantly higher than that of the controls. The production of LTB(4) and LTC(4) from the colonic mucosa in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in controls. However, only the experimental group fed a vitamin E dose 4-fold higher than that given to the controls showed a significant increase in mucosal blood flow.These results suggest that n-3 PUFAs increase mucosal blood flow by inhibiting LT production when there is sufficient vitamin E to inhibit lipid peroxidation in rats with experimental .Copyright 2001 S.

Treatment with MaxEPA increased red-cell membrane concentrations of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) at 3 months by three-fold and at 6 months by four-fold (both P < 0.01), and doubled docosahexaenoic  (DHA) levels at 6 months (P < 0.05). Treatment with super evening primrose oil increased red-cell membrane concentrations of dihomogamma- (DGLA) by 40% at 6 months (P < 0.05), whilst treatment with placebo reduced levels of DGLA and DHA at 6 months (both P < 0.05). Clinical outcome was assessed by patient diary cards, sigmoidoscopy and histology of rectal biopsy specimens. Super evening primrose oil significantly improved stool consistency compared to MaxEPA and placebo at 6 months, and this difference was maintained 3 months after treatment was discontinued (P < 0.05). There was however, no difference in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, disease relapse, sigmoidoscopic appearance or rectal histology in the three treatment groups. Despite manipulation of cell-membrane fatty acids, fish oils do not exert a therapeutic effect in ulcerative , while evening primrose oil may be of some benefit.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22243775>Attenuation of colonic inflammation by partial replacement of dietary linoleic  with α- in a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Increasing prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease may be due to imbalance in the intake of n-6 and n-3 PUFA in the diet. This study investigates the impact of varying ratios of dietary linoleic  (LA, 18 : 2n-6) to α- (ALA, 18 : 3n-3) on the inflammatory response in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced . Weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: a non-colitic group with a LA:ALA ratio of 215 (CON-215), and colitic groups with LA:ALA ratios of 215 (DSS-215), 50 (DSS-50), 10 (DSS-10) and 2 (DSS-2). Blends of groundnut, palmolein and linseed oils were used to provide varying LA:ALA ratios. All the rats were fed the respective experimental isoenergetic diets containing 10 % fat for 90 d and DSS was administered during the last 11 d. Colonic inflammation was evaluated by clinical, biochemical and histological parameters. The results showed attenuation of  in the DSS-2 group as evidenced by significant reductions in disease activity index, mucosal myeloperoxidase activity (P < 0·05), alkaline phosphatase activity (P < 0·01) and increase in colon length (P < 0·01) compared to the groups fed with higher ratios (DSS-215). This was accompanied by significant reductions in mucosal proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α (P < 0·01) and IL-1β (P < 0·01) and improvement in the histological score. Further, ALA supplementation increased long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA and decreased LC n-6 PUFA in colon structural lipids.

Here we discuss the effects of n-3 PUFAs on various inflammatory pathways and how this leads to alterations in the function of inflammatory cells, most importantly endothelial cells and leukocytes. Strong evidence indicates n-3 PUFAs are beneficial as a dietary supplement in certain diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis; however for other conditions such as asthma, the data are less robust.

In this cross-sectional study thirty patients with ulcerative  (UC), twenty-one with Crohn disease (CD) and twenty-four controls were investigated (mean age: UC, 40.8 (sd 12.1); CD, 37.6 (sd 11.0); control, 31.5 (sd 8.4) years). Fatty  composition of plasma lipids was determined by high-resolution capillary GLC. In plasma phospholipids, significantly higher values of eicosapentaenoic (20 : 5n-3), docosapentaenoic (22 : 5n-3) and gamma- (18 : 3n-6) acids were found in control patients and patients with UC as compared to patients with CD [median % (weight by weight), control v.

Some of the effects of omega-3 PUFA are brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, and other effects are elicited by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms, including actions upon intracellular signaling pathways, transcription factor activity and gene expression. Animal experiments and clinical intervention studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Coronary heart disease, major depression, aging and cancer are characterized by an increased level of interleukin 1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine. Similarly, arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative  and lupus erythematosis are autoimmune diseases characterized by a high level of IL-1 and the proinflammatory leukotriene LTB(4) produced by omega-6 fatty acids. There have been a number of clinical trials assessing the benefits of dietary supplementation with fish oils in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in humans, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative , psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and migraine headaches. Many of the placebo-controlled trials of fish oil in chronic inflammatory diseases reveal significant benefit, including decreased disease activity and a lowered use of anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680455>Dietary intake of fish, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and risk of inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.</a></h2><p>Fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs) may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to conduct a systematic review and summarize published articles on the association between fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs with the risk of IBD.PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search and identify eligible literature published prior to January 2019. Fixed-effects model or random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird method) were applied to pool the effect sizes. Cochrane Q test was used to trace the potential source of heterogeneity across studies.12 studies (5 prospective and 7 case-control) were included in the systematic review, which ten of them were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Studies were included a total sample size of 282610 participants which 2002 of them were cases of IBD [1061 Crohn's disease (CD) and 937 ulcerative  (UC)]. A negative association was found between fish consumption and the incidence of CD (pooled effect size: 0.54, 95%CI: 0.31-0.96, P = 0.03). There was no relationship between total dietary n-3 PUFAs intake and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.80-1.72, P = 0.41). A significant inverse association was observed between dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs and the risk of UC (pooled effect size: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.57-0.98, P = 0.03). Moreover, no association was found between α- (ALA) and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.63-2.17, P = 0.62).Findings showed a negative association between fish consumption and the risk of CD.

The mediators formed from the different PUFA have different potencies. We hypothesised that metabolic changes associated with colonic mucosal inflammation would modify the bioavailability of the eicosanoid precursors AA and EPA.Colonic mucosa biopsies were obtained from patients with ulcerative  and from matched controls. Inflammation was graded endoscopically and histologically. Esterified and non-esterified fatty acids were determined within the biopsies using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively.Biopsy samples were collected from 69 UC patients (54 providing both inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa) and 69 controls. Inflamed mucosa had higher AA (p<0.001) and lower EPA (p<0.010) contents and a higher AA:EPA ratio (p<0.001). Inflamed mucosa also had higher docosapentaenoic  (DPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and lower linoleic  (LA) and α- (α-LNA) contents (all p<0.001), compared to non-inflamed and controls. There were significant correlations between severity of inflammation and contents of AA, DPA and DHA (positive correlations) and of LA, α-LNA and EPA (negative correlations).Higher AA, AA:EPA ratio, DPA and DHA and lower LA, α-LNA and EPA are seen in inflamed mucosa in UC and correlate with severity of inflammation. This suggests an alteration in fatty  metabolism in the inflamed gut mucosa, which may offer novel targets for intervention and should be considered if nutritional strategies are used.Copyright © 2013 European Crohn's and  Organisation.

In vitro, LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production was significantly inhibited by MBF extracts via suppressing the expression of proinflammatory molecules, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1 beta (IL-β) and IL-6. Particularly, a dose-dependent inhibition on LPS-induced inflammatory responses was observed following treatment with MBF dichloromethane extract (MBF-DE), in which linoleic  and ethyl linolenate were identified as two active compounds. Moreover, we elucidated that MBF-DE attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses by blocking activation of both NF-κB/p65 and pERK/MAPK pathways. In vivo, DSS-induced acute  was significantly ameliorated in MBF-fed mice as gauged by weight loss, colon morphology and histological damage.

Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3 Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative , Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils [eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)].

The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha primes ROS production through phosphorylation of the NADPH-oxidase subunit p47phox on Ser345. Conventional anti-inflammatory therapies remain partially successful and may have side effects. Therefore, regulation of neutrophil activation by natural dietary components represents an alternative therapeutic strategy in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of punicic , a conjugated  fatty  from pomegranate seed oil on TNFalpha-induced neutrophil hyperactivation in vitro and on colon inflammation in vivo.We analyzed the effect of punicic  on TNFalpha-induced neutrophil upregulation of ROS production in vitro and on TNBS-induced rat colon inflammation. Results show that punicic  inhibited TNFalpha-induced priming of ROS production in vitro while preserving formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-induced response. This effect was mediated by the inhibition of Ser345-p47phox phosphorylation and upstream kinase p38MAPK. Punicic  also inhibited fMLP- and TNFalpha+fMLP-induced MPO extracellular release from neutrophils. In vivo experiments showed that punicic  and pomegranate seed oil intake decreased neutrophil-activation and ROS/MPO-mediated tissue damage as measured by F2-isoprostane release and protected rats from TNBS-induced colon inflammation.These data show that punicic  exerts a potent anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of TNFalpha-induced priming of NADPH oxidase by targeting the p38MAPKinase/Ser345-p47phox-axis and MPO release.

The bradykinin-stimulated DeltaIsc was significantly suppressed after pretreatment with indomethacin in both the soybean and perilla groups, and was also significantly reduced in both groups after pretreatment with AA861. The suppression of bradykinin-stimulated DeltaIsc by the addition of AA861 was significantly higher in the perilla group than in the soybean group.Our results suggest that supplementation with , in combination with a lipoxygenase inhibitor, could suppress the increase in Cl- secretion in patients with UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17604003>13-Oxo-ODE is an endogenous ligand for PPARgamma in human colonic epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>The ligand activated nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) induces transcriptional repression of pro-inflammatory factors. Activation of PPARgamma is followed by amelioration of  in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A reduced expression of PPARgamma was found in epithelial cells of patients with ulcerative . The eicosanoids 13-HODE and 15-HETE are products of 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX) and endogenous ligands for PPARgamma. Dehydrogenation of 13-HODE by 13-HODE dehydrogenase results in formation of the 13-Oxo-ODE. Highest activity of 13-HODE dehydrogenase is found in colonic epithelial cells (CECs). We therefore investigated whether 13-Oxo-ODE is a new endogenous ligand of PPARgamma in CECs.LOX activity and 13-HODE dehydrogenase in CECs were investigated after stimulation with arachidonic or linoleic . LOX metabolites were identified by RP-18 reversed-phase HPLC. Binding of (14)C-labelled 13-Oxo-ODE was demonstrated using a His-tagged PPARgamma.Stimulation of HT-29 and primary CECs homogenates with and without Ca-ionophor was followed by the formation of high amounts of the linoleic  metabolite 13-Oxo-ODE (155 and 85 ng/ml). The decrease of IL-8 secretion from IEC was more pronounced after pre-incubation with 13-Oxo-ODE compared to the PPARgamma agonist troglitazone and higher as with the known PPARgamma ligands 13-HODE and 15-HETE. Binding assays with (14)C-labelled 13-Oxo-ODE clearly demonstrated a direct interaction.High amounts of 13-Oxo-ODE can be induced in CECs by stimulation of linoleic  metabolism. 13-Oxo-ODE binds to PPARgamma and has anti-inflammatory effects. 13-HODE dehydrogenase might be a therapeutic target in IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9192066>Nutrition and ulcerative .</a></h2><p>The role of diet in the aetiology and pathogenesis of ulcerative  (UC) remains uncertain. Impaired utilization by colonocytes of butyrate, a product of bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates escaping digestion, may be important. Sulphur-fermenting bacteria may be involved in this impaired utilization. Oxidative stress probably mediates tissue injury but is probably not of causative importance. Patients with UC are prone to malnutrition and its detrimental effects. However, there is no role for total parenteral nutrition and bowel rest as primary therapy for UC. The maintenance of adequate nutrition is very important, particularly in the peri-operative patient. In the absence of massive bleeding, perforation, toxic megacolon or obstruction, enteral rather than parenteral nutrition should be the mode of choice. Nutrients may be beneficial as adjuvant therapy. Butyrate enemas have improved patients with otherwise recalcitrant distal  in small studies. Non-cellulose fibre supplements are of benefit in rats with experimental . Eicosapentaenoic  in fish oil has a steroid-sparing effect which, although modest, is important, particularly in terms of reducing the risk of osteoporosis, but it seems to have no role in the patient with inactive disease. gamma- and anti-oxidants also are showing promise. Nutrients may also modify the increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. Oxidative stress can damage tissue DNA but there are no data published at present on possible protection from oral anti-oxidants. Butyrate protects against experimental carcinogenesis in rats with experimental . Folate supplementation is weakly associated with decreased incidence of cancer in UC patients when assessed retrospectively. Vigilance should be maintained for increased micronutrient requirements and supplements given as appropriate. Calcium and low-dose vitamin D should be given to patients on long-term steroids and folate to those on sulphasalazine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20724486>An α--rich formula reduces oxidative stress and inflammation by regulating NF-κB in rats with TNBS-induced .</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that α- (ALA), a (n-3) PUFA exerts in vitro antiinflammatory effects in the intestine. In this study, we aimed to evaluate its effect on inflammatory and oxidative stress in a  model.  was induced in 2 groups at d 0 by intrarectal injection of 2-4-6-trinitrobenzen sulfonic  (TNBS), whereas the control group received the vehicle. Rats we fed 450 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1) of ALA (TNBS+ALA) while the other colitic group (TNBS) and the control group were fed an isocaloric corn oil formula for 14 d (from d -7 to d 7). RBC fatty  composition was assessed. Oxidative stress was studied by measuring urinary 8-isoprostanes (8-IP) and colon glutathione (GSH) concentration and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression.  was assessed histologically, by production of proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines, leukotrienes B(4) (LTB(4)), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. The ALA-rich diet significantly increased the RBC levels of ALA, eicosapentaenoic , and docosapentaenoic  (n-3) compared with the TNBS group (P < 0.01 for all). The beneficial effect of ALA supplementation on oxidative stress was reflected by lower urinary 8-IP levels (P < 0.05), a normalized colon GSH concentration (P < 0.01), and reduced colon iNOS expression (P < 0.05) compared with the TNBS group. ALA also protected against colon inflammation as assessed by lower tumor necrosis factor-α secretion and mRNA level (P < 0.05), reduced NF-κB activation (P = 0.01), and lower colon lipid mediator concentrations such as LTB(4) and COX-2 (P < 0.05) compared with the TNBS group. These findings show that an ALA-rich formula is beneficial to TNBS-induced colitic rats via inhibition of oxidative and inflammatory stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8563904>Therapeutic efficacy of N-3 polyunsaturated fatty  in experimental Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on trinitro-benzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced  in the rats, which condition is considered an experimental Crohn's disease (CD). In rats with TNBS-induced , feeding with an elemental diet (ED) plus 2% n-3 PUEA-rich perilla oil significantly suppressed plasma leukotriene (LT) B4 and ulcer index compared to that in rats fed with ED plus 2% n-6 PUFA-rich safflower oil (34.2 +/- 12.3 s 63.8 +/- 13.2 pg/ml and 8.8 +/- 12.1 vs 66.4 +/- 33.1, P < 0.01, respectively). Moreover, the plasma LTB4 and the ulcer index were significantly correlated (P < 0.05). Feeding with ED plus 2%  (A-LA)-rich vegetable oil significantly reduced plasma LTB4 and colonic weight compared to that in rats fed with ED plus 2% eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)/docosahexaenonic  (DHA)-rich fish oil in this model (61.6 +/- 10.5 vs 85.0 +/- 20.9 pg/ml and 0.83 +/- 0.13 vs 0.96 +/- 0.08g, P < 0.05, respectively). This study suggested that dietary fat manipulation with perilla oil can reduce colonic damage and that this is correlated with the suppression of plasma LTB4. The therapeutic efficacy of A-LA in controlling intestinal inflammation in experimental CD may be superior to that of EPA and DHA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26350254>α- (ALA) is an anti-inflammatory agent in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Studies suggest that consumption of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) plays a protective role in inflammatory bowel disease; however, the use of plant-derived oils rich in α- (ALA) has not been widely investigated. The aims of this study were to test the effects of two different sources of (n-3) PUFA, fish and plant-derived oils, in two animal models of experimental  and to determine whether the (n-3) PUFA-enriched diets could ameliorate the inflammatory status. Rats were fed diets rich in corn, fish or sage oil with or without vitamin A supplementation for 3weeks then  was induced by adding dextran sodium sulfate to the drinking water or by injecting 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic . We show that colitic rats fed the sage oil diets had a lower inflammatory response, improved histological repair and had less necrotic damage in the mucosa when compared to the corn and fish oil groups. Colonic damage and myeloperoxidase activity were significantly lower. Colonic mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including interleukin IL-6, cyclooxygenase 2 and tumor necrosis factor α were markedly down-regulated in rats fed fish and sage oils compared to control. These results were supported by experiments in the human colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2, where ALA supplementation was shown to be effective in inhibiting inflammation induced by IL-1β by down-regulating mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including IL-8, COX2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Taken together, these results suggest that plant-derived oil rich in ALA could ameliorate the inflammatory damage in .Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

POE and soybean oil emulsion (SOE) were infused at 20% of nonprotein energy during 7 days' total parenteral nutrition (TPN). After infusion of test solutions, body weight gain and cumulative nitrogen balance in the POE group were significantly higher than those in the fat-free TPN (FF) group after infusion of test solutions. Moreover, those in the POE group were higher than those in the SOE group, but no significant difference was observed between the POE and SOE groups. In the POE group, total cholesterol and phospholipid concentration in the plasma was significantly decreased compared with the FF and SOE groups. Triglyceride concentration in the plasma did not significantly differ between the POE, SOE and FF groups. Plasma lipid peroxide concentration in the POE group was significantly lower than that in the SOE group, but it was not different from the FF group. In fatty  composition in the plasma total lipids, linoleic  in the POE and SOE groups and  in the POE group were significantly increased compared with those in the FF group. Arachidonic  (AA) in the POE and FF groups were significantly decreased compared with that in the SOE group. Otherwise, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) in the POE group was significantly increased compared with that in the SOE and FF groups. EPA/AA ratio in the POE group was significantly increased compared with the SOE group. The thickness and damage score of the colon were significantly depressed in the POE group compared with the SOE group. These results suggest that POE has a superior nutritional effect and improves inflammation in the IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26714018>Modeling-Enabled Characterization of Novel NLRX1 Ligands.</a></h2><p>Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) family are intracellular sentinels of cytosolic homeostasis that orchestrate immune and inflammatory responses in infectious and immune-mediated diseases. NLRX1 is a mitochondrial-associated NOD-like receptor involved in the modulation of immune and metabolic responses. This study utilizes molecular docking approaches to investigate the structure of NLRX1 and experimentally assesses binding to naturally occurring compounds from several natural product and lipid databases. Screening of compound libraries predicts targeting of NLRX1 by conjugated trienes, polyketides, prenol lipids, sterol lipids, and coenzyme A-containing fatty acids for activating the NLRX1 pathway. The ligands of NLRX1 were identified by docking punicic  (PUA), eleostearic  (ESA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) to the C-terminal fragment of the human NLRX1 (cNLRX1). Their binding and that of positive control RNA to cNLRX1 were experimentally determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. In addition, the ligand binding sites of cNLRX1 were predicted in silico and validated experimentally. Target mutagenesis studies demonstrate that mutation of 4 critical residues ASP677, PHE680, PHE681, and GLU684 to alanine resulted in diminished affinity of PUA, ESA, and DHA to NLRX1. Consistent with the regulatory actions of NLRX1 on the NF-κB pathway, treatment of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM)s with PUA and DHA suppressed NF-κB activity in a NLRX1 dependent mechanism. In addition, a series of pre-clinical efficacy studies were performed using a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced . Our findings showed that the regulatory function of PUA on  is NLRX1 dependent. Thus, we identified novel small molecules that bind to NLRX1 and exert anti-inflammatory actions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23142806>Reduced bone breakage and increased bone strength in free range laying hens fed omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  supplemented diets.</a></h2><p>The omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the immediate precursors to a number of important mediators of immunity, inflammation and bone function, with products of omega-6 generally thought to promote inflammation and favour bone resorption. Western diets generally provide a 10 to 20-fold deficit in omega-3 PUFAs compared with omega-6, and this is thought to have contributed to the marked rise in incidence of disorders of modern human societies, such as heart disease,  and perhaps osteoporosis. Many of our food production animals, fed on grains rich in omega-6, are also exposed to a dietary deficit in omega-3, with perhaps similar health consequences. Bone fragility due to osteoporotic changes in laying hens is a major economic and welfare problem, with our recent estimates of breakage rates indicating up to 95% of free range hens suffer breaks during lay.Free range hens housed in full scale commercial systems were provided diets supplemented with omega-3 , and the skeletal benefits were investigated by comparison to standard diets rich in omega-6.There was a significant 40-60% reduction in keel bone breakage rate, and a corresponding reduction in breakage severity in the omega-3 supplemented hens. There was significantly greater bone density and bone mineral content, alongside increases in total bone and trabecular volumes. The mechanical properties of the omega-3 supplemented hens were improved, with strength, energy to break and stiffness demonstrating significant increases. Alkaline phosphatase (an osteoblast marker) and tartrate-resistant  phosphatase (an osteoclast marker) both showed significant increases with the omega-3 diets, indicating enhanced bone turnover. This was corroborated by the significantly lower levels of the mature collagen crosslinks, hydroxylysyl pyridinoline, lysyl pyridinoline and histidinohydroxy-lysinonorleucine, with a corresponding significant shift in the mature:immature crosslink ratio.The improved skeletal health in laying hens corresponds to as many as 68million fewer hens suffering keel fractures in the EU each year. The biomechanical and biochemical evidence suggests that increased bone turnover has enhanced the bone mechanical properties, and that this may suggest potential benefits for human osteoporosis.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This experimental model allows the induction of  relapse and remission periods and the establishment of chronic disease features, such as the mesenteric adipose tissue alterations observed in Crohn's disease. Lymph node activation and the role of perinodal adipose tissue (PAT) have been poorly studied in this model. Thus, a study of the interactions of lymph nodes and PAT could help to elucidate the mechanisms behind IBD pathogenesis.The purpose of this study was to examine lymph nodes and PAT alterations during reactivated TNBS- in Wistar rats.In this study, the alterations of PAT and lymph node cells during experimental , induced by repeated intracolonic TNBS instillations, were evaluated, focusing on fatty  and adipocytokine profile analysis and cytokines production, respectively.Fatty  analysis of PAT reveals an increase of ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids during colits, such as linoleic , gamma- and arachidonic . ω-6 arachidonic  was not increased in lymph node cells or serum. PAT also produces elevated levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines during . Lymph node cells release high levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α but not IL-10, characterizing the predominant Th-1 response associated with this disease. Nevertheless, T cells from animals with  demonstrated increased IFN-γ production via a COX-2-dependent mechanism after supplementation with ω-6 arachidonic , suggesting that PAT modification could contribute to the lymph node cell activation observed during .</p></html>
