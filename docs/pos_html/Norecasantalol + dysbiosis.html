Inactivating NOX variants are associated with comorbid intestinal inflammation in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD; NOX2) and pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; NOX1); however Nox-deficient mice do not reflect human disease susceptibility. Here we assessed if a hypomorphic patient-relevant CGD mutation will increase the risk for intestinal inflammation in mice. Cyba (p22) mutant mice generated low intestinal ROS, while maintaining Nox4 function. The Cyba variant caused profound mucus layer disruption with bacterial penetration into crypts, , and a compromised innate immune response to invading microbes, leading to mortality. Approaches used in treatment-resistant CGD or pediatric IBD such as bone marrow transplantation or oral antibiotic treatment ameliorated or prevented disease in mice. The Cyba mutant mouse phenotype implicates loss of both mucus barrier and efficient innate immune defense in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation due to ROS deficiency, supporting a combined-hit model where a single disease variant compromises different cellular functions in interdependent compartments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555606>Conceptual Design of a Universal Donor Screening Approach for Vaginal Microbiota Transplant.</a></h2><p>The success of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in treating recurrent  infection has led to growing excitement about the potential of using transplanted human material as a therapy for a wide range of diseases and conditions related to microbial . We anticipate that the next frontier of microbiota transplantation will be vaginal microbiota transplant (VMT). The composition of the vaginal microbiota has broad impact on sexual and reproductive health. The vaginal microbiota in the "optimal" state are one of the simplest communities, dominated by one of only a few species of Lactobacillus. Diversity in the microbiota and the concomitant depletion of lactobacilli, a condition referred to as bacterial vaginosis (BV), is associated with a wide range of deleterious effects, including increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections and increased likelihood of having a preterm birth. However, we have very few treatment options available, and none of them curative or restorative, for "resetting" the vaginal microbiota to a more protective state. In order to test the hypothesis that VMT may be a more effective treatment option, we must first determine how to screen donors to find those with minimal risk of pathogen transmission and "optimal" vaginal microbiota for transplant. Here, we describe a universal donor screening approach that was implemented in a small pilot study of 20 women. We further characterized key physicochemical properties of donor cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) and the corresponding composition of the vaginal microbiota to delineate criteria for inclusion/exclusion. We anticipate that the framework described here will help accelerate clinical studies of VMT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543676>Intestinal permeability in the pathogenesis of liver damage: From non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to liver transplantation.</a></h2><p>The intimate connection and the strict mutual cooperation between the gut and the liver realizes a functional entity called gut-liver axis. The integrity of intestinal barrier is crucial for the maintenance of liver homeostasis. In this mutual relationship, the liver acts as a second firewall towards potentially harmful substances translocated from the gut, and is, in turn, is implicated in the regulation of the barrier. Increasing evidence has highlighted the relevance of increased intestinal permeability and consequent bacterial translocation in the development of liver damage. In particular, in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease recent hypotheses are considering intestinal permeability impairment, diet and gut  as the primary pathogenic trigger. In advanced liver disease, intestinal permeability is enhanced by portal hypertension. The clinical consequence is an increased bacterial translocation that further worsens liver damage. Furthermore, this pathogenic mechanism is implicated in most of liver cirrhosis complications, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome, portal vein thrombosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma. After liver transplantation, the decrease in portal pressure should determine beneficial effects on the gut-liver axis, although are incompletely understood data on the modifications of the intestinal permeability and gut microbiota composition are still lacking. How the modulation of the intestinal permeability could prevent the initiation and progression of liver disease is still an uncovered area, which deserves further attention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594648>Tangible pathologies in functional dyspepsia.</a></h2><p>Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common, costly and complex disease, currently defined by symptoms, directed by the Rome consensus on functional bowel disorders, which has evolved over the past two decades. Symptoms include abdominal pain, are often meal related and there are two major subtypes, postprandial distress syndrome and epigastric pain syndrome, not attributed to pathology. Increasingly it is recognised that tangible pathologies occur in FD, for example Helicobacter pylori and other pathophysiological changes, most notably duodenal pathology, namely duodenal eosinophilia, permeability alterations, structural neuronal changes and microbial duodenal . This has led to the idea that FD is a true disease entity and triggers of this condition based on epidemiology studies point towards allergy, immune disorders and infection. Anxiety and depression may precede or follow FD, (brain-gut/gut-brain disorders). Currently most therapies for FD are inadequate but underlying pathology may lead to targeted treatment success as an attainable goal.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), multifactorial chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, have been associated with intestinal , the detailed interactions between host and gut microbiota are still not completely understood. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) represent 1% of the intestinal epithelium. Accumulating evidence indicates that EECs are key sensors of gut microbiota and/or microbial metabolites. They can secrete cytokines and peptide hormones in response to microbiota, either in traditional endocrine regulation or by paracrine impact on proximal tissues and/or cells or via afferent nerve fibers. Enteroendocrine cells also play crucial roles in mucosal immunity, gut barrier function, visceral hyperalgesia, and gastrointestinal (GI) motility, thereby regulating several GI diseases, including IBD. In this review, we will focus on EECs in sensing microbiota, correlating enteroendocrine perturbations with IBD, and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Probiotic administration has been suggested as a safe therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. This study was designed to assess the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum 296, a fruit-derived bacteria strain, against cardiometabolic disorders induced by HF diet.Male Wistar rats were divided into control diet (CTL); HF diet; and HF diet treated with Lactobacillus fermentum 296 (HF + Lf 296). The L. fermentum 296 strain at 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml were daily administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. The results showed that rats fed with HF diet displayed insulin resistance, reduced Lactobacillus spp. counts in feces, serum lipids, and oxidative profile. Rats fed on HF diet also demonstrated augmented blood pressure associated with sympathetic hyperactivity and impaired baroreflex control. The administration of L. fermentum 296 for 4 weeks recovered fecal Lactobacillus sp. counts and alleviated hyperlipidemia, sympathetic hyperactivity, and reduced systolic blood pressure in HF rats without affecting baroreflex sensibility.Our results suggest the ability of L. fermentum 296 improve biochemical and cardiovascular parameters altered in cardiometabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

We postulated that diabetes and systemic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact both the microbiome and gut barrier function.  Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were performed on fecal samples from WT, ACE2, Akita (type 1 diabetic, T1D), and ACE2-Akita mice. Gut barrier integrity was assessed by immunofluorescence, and BM cell extravasation into the small intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the CE2-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted barrier was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiome of ACE2-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan (PGN) producing bacteria. When compared to control cohorts treated with saline, intraperitoneal administration of MACs significantly decreased the microbiome gene expression associated with PGN biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut barrier integrity. Also indicative of diabetic gut barrier dysfunction, increased levels of PGN and intestinal fatty acid binding protein-2 (FABP-2) were observed in plasma of human subjects with T1D (n=21) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=23) compared to non-diabetic controls (n=23). Using human retinal endothelial cells, we determined that PGN activates a non-canonical Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) associated MyD88-ARNO-ARF6 signaling cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of PGN on the endothelium.  We demonstrate for the first time that the defect in gut barrier function and  in CE2-Akita mice can be favorably impacted by exogenous administration of MACs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548508>Food Preservatives Induce   in Human-Microbiota Associated -Deficient Mice.</a></h2><p>The worldwide incidence of many immune-mediated and metabolic diseases, initially affecting only the wealthy Western countries, is increasing rapidly.

Obesity in children is also on rise, indicating the urgent need of strategies for prevention and intervention that must begin in early life. While originally posited that obesity results from the simple concept of consuming more calories, or genetics, emerging research suggests that the bacteria living in our gut (gut microbiome) and its interactions with immune cells and metabolic organs including adipose tissues (microbiome-immune-metabolic axis) play significant role in obesity development in childhood. Specifically, abnormal changes () in the gut microbiome, stimulation of inflammatory cytokines, and shifts in the metabolic functions of brown adipose tissue and the browning of white adipose tissue are associated with increased obesity. Many factors from as early as gestation appear to contribute in obesity, such as maternal health, diet, antibiotic use by mother and/or child, and birth and feeding methods. Herein, using evidence from animal and human studies, we discuss how these factors impact microbiome-immune-metabolic axis and cause obesity epidemic in children, and describe the gaps in knowledge that are warranted for future research.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611994>Characteristics of fecal gut microbiota in patients with colorectal cancer at different stages and different sites.</a></h2><p>Numerous studies have revealed that the gut microbiota serves an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The present study aimed to investigate the populations present in the gut microbiota in patients with CRC of different stages and at different sites. Fecal samples were obtained from 67 CRC patients and 30 healthy controls, which were analyzed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Increased diversity of the fecal gut microbiota in patients with CRC was reported compared with the healthy controls. In the present study, at the genus level, the relative abundances of  and  in the gut microbiota of CRC patients were substantially increased compared with healthy controls, while the relative abundance of  was significantly lower.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, antidiabetic agents, reportedly inhibit the HSC proliferation. Additionally, Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) agonists induce the systemic release of glucagon-like peptides from intestinal L cells, which maintains glycemic homeostasis. This study assessed the combined effect of TGR5 agonist and DPP-4 inhibitor on diabetes-based liver fibrosis development. Male diabetic rats received intraperitoneal injection of porcine serum (PS) to induce liver fibrosis, and they were orally administered the following agents: oleanolic acid (OA) as a TGR5 agonist, anagliptin (ANA) as a DPP-4 inhibitor, and a combination of both agents. Treatment with OA or ANA significantly improved glycemic status and attenuated intrahepatic steatosis and lipid peroxidation in diabetic rats. PS-induced liver fibrosis development was also drastically suppressed by treatment with either agent, and the combination of both reciprocally enhanced the antifibrotic effect. Fecal microbiome demonstrated that both agents inhibited the increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, an indicator of  related to metabolic syndromes. Furthermore, ANA directly inhibited in vitro HSC proliferative and profibrogenic activities.

Antibiotics perturb the bacterial gut composition but the extent of these changes and potential consequences for animal and human health is still debated. Six calves were housed in a controlled environment. Three animals received an injection of the antibiotic florfenicol (Nuflor), and three received no treatment. Faecal samples were collected at 0, 3 and 7 days, and bacterial communities were profiled to assess the impact of a therapy on the gut microbiota. Phylogenetic analysis (16S-rDNA) established that at day 7, antibiotic-treated microbiota showed a 10-fold increase in facultative anaerobic Escherichia spp, a signature of imbalanced microbiota, . The antibiotic resistome showed a high background of antibiotic resistance genes, which did not significantly change in response to florfenicol. However, the maintenance of Escherichia coli plasmid-encoded quinolone, oqxB and propagation of mcr-2, and colistin resistance genes were observed and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The microbiota of treated animals was enriched with energy harvesting bacteria, common to obese microbial communities. We propose that antibiotic treatment of healthy animals leads to unbalanced, disease- and obese-related microbiota that promotes growth of E. coli carrying resistance genes on mobile elements, potentially increasing the risk of transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria to humans.© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that gut , peripheral inflammation, and peripheral insulin resistance occur before the brain inflammatory response, hippocampal synaptic dysplasticity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cognitive impairment in HFD-fed rats.Male Wistar rats received either a normal diet or an HFD for 2, 8, 12, 20, or 40 wk. At the end of each time point, cognitive functions and metabolic parameters were determined. Gut microbiota, brain immune cell activity, amyloid-β level, microglia morphology, hippocampal reactive oxygen species and apoptosis, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and dendritic spine density were measured.We found that HFD-fed rats developed gut  at week 2 and peripheral insulin resistance at week 8. Rats fed an HFD for 12 wk displayed hippocampal synaptic dysplasticity, decreased dendritic spine density, an elevation of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 cells, increased hippocampal reactive oxygen species levels and hippocampal apoptosis with cognitive decline. The decreased percentage of resident microglia and increased percentage of infiltrated macrophage were observed at weeks 20 and 40. Surprisingly, brain amyloid-β levels were increased after 40 wk of an HFD diet.These findings demonstrated that gut  develops in the earliest phase of consumption of an HFD, followed by brain pathology, which leads to cognitive decline in obese insulin-resistant rats. Therefore, an improvement in gut  should provide beneficial effects in the prevention of neuropathology and cognitive decline in the obese.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The evidence suggests that this pathogenic gut-brain circuit involves: (i) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the GI-tract resident enterotoxigenic Gram-negative bacteria Bacteroides fragilis (BF-LPS); (ii) LPS transit across the GI-tract barrier into the systemic circulation; (iii) transport of a highly pro-inflammatory systemic BF-LPS across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the brain-parenchyma and neuronal-cytoplasm; (iv) activation and signaling via the pro-inflammatory NF-kB (p50/p65) transcription-factor complex; (v) NF-kB-coupling and significant up-regulation of the inducible pro-inflammatory microRNA-146a (miRNA-146a) and microRNA-155 (miRNA-155); each containing multiple NF-kB DNA-binding and activation sites in their immediate promoters; and (vi) subsequent down-regulation of miRNA-146a-miRNA-155 regulated mRNA targets such as that encoding complement factor H (CFH), a soluble complement control glycoprotein and key repressor of the innate-immune response. Down-regulated CFH expression activates the complement-system, the major non-cellular component of the innate-immune system while propagating neuro-inflammation. Other GI-tract microbes and their highly complex pro-inflammatory exudates may contribute to this pathogenic GI-tract-brain pathway. We speculate that it may be significant that the first Gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species intensively studied as a potential contributor to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), that being the bacillus Bacteroides fragilis appears to utilize damaged or leaky physiological barriers and an activated NF-kB (p50-p65) - pro-inflammatory miRNA-146a-miRNA-155 signaling circuit to convey microbiome-derived pathogenic signals into the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540209>Effects of a Resident Yeast from the Honeybee Gut on Immunity, Microbiota, and  Disease.</a></h2><p>The western honeybee () has a core bacterial microbiota that is well described and important for health.

TREMs are emerging as key players in pivotal mechanisms often concurring in IBD and neurodegeneration, namely microbiota , leaky gut, and inflammation. In conditions of , compounds released by intestinal bacteria activate TREMs on macrophages, leading to an exuberant pro-inflammatory reaction up to damage in the gut barrier. In turn, TREM-positive activated macrophages along with inflammatory mediators may reach the brain through the blood, glymphatic system, circumventricular organs, or the vagus nerve via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This leads to a systemic inflammatory response which, in turn, impairs the blood-brain barrier, while promoting further TREM-dependent neuroinflammation and, ultimately, neural injury. Nonetheless, controversial results still exist on the role of TREM-2 compared with TREM-1, depending on disease specificity, stage, and degree of inflammation. Therefore, the present review aimed to provide an update on the role of TREMs in the pathophysiology of IBD and neurodegeneration.

In this conversion, most of the plant materials are digested by rumen fermentation and are changed to short-chain fatty acids, microbial cells, and methane, which is released into the atmosphere. The relationships among feed, rumen fermentation, and milk production are poorly understood. Here we report a novel indicator of characteristics of rumen fermentation, theoretical turnover rate (TTOR) of the rumen liquid fraction. The TTOR was calculated from the presumed rumen volume (PRV) which is estimated by dividing the methane yield by the methane concentration of rumen fluid. The formula for the TTOR is: TTOR = PRV/body weight . Our present analyses confirm that the TTOR as an indicator is capable of connecting feed, rumen fermentation, and milk production, because dry matter intake/TTOR showed a strong correlation with milk yield/TTOR. In addition, the TTOR may be related to ruminal pH, as we observed that the ruminal pH decreased as the TTOR increased. We propose that the TTOR is a factor characterizing rumen fermentation and a good indicator of the productivity of ruminants and dysbiosis of the rumen .© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619277>Of microbes and mange: consistent changes in the skin microbiome of three canid species infected with Sarcoptes scabiei mites.</a></h2><p>Sarcoptic mange is a highly contagious skin disease caused by the ectoparasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Although it afflicts over 100 mammal species worldwide, sarcoptic mange remains a disease obscured by variability at the individual, population and species levels. Amid this variability, it is critical to identify consistent drivers of morbidity, particularly at the skin barrier.Using culture-independent next generation sequencing, we characterized the skin microbiome of three species of North American canids: coyotes (Canis latrans), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). We compared alpha and beta diversity between mange-infected and uninfected canids using the Kruskal-Wallis test and multivariate analysis of variance with permutation. We used analysis of composition of microbes and gneiss balances to perform differential abundance testing between infection groups.We found remarkably consistent signatures of microbial  associated with mange infection. Across genera, mange-infected canids exhibited reduced microbial diversity, altered community composition and increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens. The primary bacteria comprising secondary infections were Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, previously associated with canid ear and skin infections, and Corynebacterium spp., previously found among the gut flora of S. scabiei mites and hematophagous arthropods.This evidence suggests that sarcoptic mange infection consistently alters the canid skin microbiome and facilitates secondary bacterial infection, as seen in humans and other mammals infected with S. scabiei mites. These results provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of mange at the skin barrier of North American canids and can inspire novel treatment strategies.

The rat model of sepsis was reproduced by injection of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via tail vein, the rats in the NS control group was given the same amount of NS. The rats in the fecal microbiota transplantation group received nasogastric infusion of feces from healthy donor on the 1st day, 2 mL each time, for 3 times a day, the other two groups were given equal dose of NS by gavage. Fecal samples were collected on the 7th day after modeling, the levels of intestinal microbiota composition was determined using the 16SrDNA gene sequencing technology. The brain function was evaluated by electroencephalogram (EEG), and the proportion of each waveform in EEG was calculated. After sacrifice of rats, the brain tissues were harvested, the levels of protein expression of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) were determined by Western Blot, and positive cells of Iba-1 in brain tissue were detected by immunohistochemistry method. The levels of interleukins (IL-6 and IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Seven days after the reproduction of the model, all rats in the NS control group survived, while 10 rats and 8 rats died in the sepsis model group and fecal microbiota transplantation group, respectively, with mortality rates of 50% and 40% respectively.

Inhibitors of P. gingivalis growth are expected to serve as effective drugs for curing this disease. In the present study, we isolated new growth inhibitors of P. gingivalis using minimal media for P. gingivalis. The minimal media included the previously reported GA (Globulin-Albumin) and the newly developed LF (Lactalbumin-Ferric chloride) and GC (Globulin-Calcium chloride); all supported growth of the wild-type strain of P. gingivalis but did not support the growth of a mutant defective for a type IX secretion system. GC contains CaCl2, indicating that P. gingivalis requires a calcium ion for growth. Using LF and GA, we screened about one hundred thousand compounds and identified seventy-three that strongly inhibited the growth of P. gingivalis. More than half of these candidates would not have been obtained if these minimal media had not been used in our screen. One of our candidate inhibitors was diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPIC), which showed strong bactericidal activity against P. gingivalis. Excess amounts of flavin adenine dinucleotide or flavin mononucleotide suppressed the inhibitory activity of DPIC, suggesting that DPIC would be a novel potent growth inhibitor.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619666>Microbe-host interplay in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.</a></h2><p>Despite recent advances in understanding microbial diversity in skin homeostasis, the relevance of microbial  in inflammatory disease is poorly understood.

However, a discrepancy exists between the well-documented pharmacological activities that curcumin seems to possess in vivo and its poor aqueous solubility, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetic profiles that should limit any therapeutic effect. Thus, it is possible that curcumin could exert direct regulative effects primarily in the gastrointestinal tract, where high concentrations of curcumin are present after oral administration. Indeed, a new working hypothesis that could explain the neuroprotective role of curcumin despite its limited availability is that curcumin acts indirectly on the central nervous system by influencing the "microbiota-gut-brain axis", a complex bidirectional system in which the microbiome and its composition represent a factor which preserves and determines brain "health".

Total Clematis triterpenoid saponins (CTSs) prepared from Clematis mandshurica Rupr. possess therapeutic benefits for arthritic diseases. However, the poor pharmacokinetic properties of CTSs have obstructed the translation of these natural agents to drugs. Here, we examined the effects of CTSs on arthritis symptoms, gut microbiota and SCFAs in rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Our results showed that the arthritis index scores of CIA rats treated with CTSs were significantly lower than those of the model group. Most importantly, CTSs moderated gut microbial  and significantly downregulated the total SCFA concentration in CIA rats. Compared to the control group, CTSs treatment have no significant side effects on the gut microbiota and SCFA metabolism in normal rats. Two differential analyses (LEfSe and DESeq2) were combined to study the details of the changes in gut microbiome, and twenty-four marker taxa at the genus level were identified via a comparison among control, model and CIA rats treated with high doses of CTSs. In particular, the mostly significantly decreased gram-negative (G-) and increased gram-positive (G) genera in CIA rats were well restored by CTSs. The observed SCFA concentrations demonstrated that CTSs tend to maintain the balance of the gut microbiota.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which TOE affects dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis remain unclear. After DSS-induced colitis were treated with different concentrations of TOE for 8 days, the bodyweight, disease activity index (DAI), colon lengths and pathological scoring were assessed, and histopathological examination was confirmed by HE staining. Furthermore, a transcriptome sequencing was performed by using the colon tissues between TOE and DSS groups, and the differentially expressed genes were conducted for the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and were validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. In addition, a 16S rDNA sequencing was carried out to distinguish the differential gut microbiota by using the mouse faecal samples between TOE and DSS groups. We found that TOE attenuated the clinical symptoms, lowered the inflammatory scoring and inhibited the secretion of proinflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in DSS-induced colitis. KEGG and GSEA analysis demonstrated that fatty acid degradation and cytokine-receptor signalling were predominantly enriched in TOE-treated colitis as compared with the DSS group.

In this study we investigated whether the gut  profile of Italian healthy volunteers could differ based on their geographical origin.16S rRNA gene sequencing was employed to analyze the gut  of 31 healthy volunteers from three different Italian regions: Apulia (South), Lazio (Center) and Lombardy (North).Differences in  composition were detected when the study participants were grouped by their region of origin and when they were classified based on age classes (-values < 0.05). Also species richness was significantly different both according to Italian Regions (median richness: 177.8 vs. 140.7 vs. 168.0 in Apulia, Lazio and Lombardy;  < 0.001) and according to age classes (median richness: 140.1 vs. 177.8 vs. 160.0 in subjects < 32, 32-41 and > 41 years;  < 0.001), whereas the Shannon index and beta diversity did not change.This study identified differences in the gut  composition and richness among individuals with the same ethnicity coming from three different Italian regions.

Intestinal microbiome differences were assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal pellet DNA. Blood was collected after euthanasia. CD86 expression in draining nodes was examined by flow cytometry. At day 15, a single dose of LPS or vehicle was topically applied to ABX and naïve mice. Corneal epithelium and conjunctiva were obtained after 4 hours and processed for gene expression analysis. A separate group of germ-free (GF) B6 mice was also topically challenged with LPS.Antibiotic treatment significantly decreased intestinal diversity and increased serum levels of LPS. This was accompanied by a significant increase in CD86+MHC II+CD11c+CD11b+ cells in draining nodes. Compared to vehicle, topically applied LPS increased IL-1β, TNF-α, and CXCL10 mRNA transcripts in cornea and IL-1β, TNF-α, and CXCL10 in the conjunctiva in conventional and antibiotic-treated groups. However, there was higher TNF-α, CXCL10, and IL-12 expression in the cornea of LPS-treated ABX mice compared to LPS-treated mice with intact microbiota. LPS stimulation on GF conjunctiva mirrored the results in ABX mice, although greater IL-12 and IFN-γ expression was observed in GF conjunctiva compared to conventional LPS-treated mice.Acute depletion of commensals through antibiotics or germ-free environment worsens the inflammatory response to LPS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654639>The spinal cord-gut-immune axis as a master regulator of health and neurological function after spinal cord injury.</a></h2><p>Most spinal cord injury (SCI) research programs focus only on the injured spinal cord with the goal of restoring locomotor function by overcoming mechanisms of cell death or axon regeneration failure. Given the importance of the spinal cord as a locomotor control center and the public perception that paralysis is the defining feature of SCI, this "spinal-centric" focus is logical. Unfortunately, such a focus likely will not yield new discoveries that reverse other devastating consequences of SCI including cardiovascular and metabolic disease, bladder/bowel dysfunction and infection. The current review considers how SCI changes the physiological interplay between the spinal cord, the gut and the immune system. A suspected culprit in causing many of the pathological manifestations of impaired spinal cord-gut-immune axis homeostasis is the gut microbiota. After SCI, the composition of the gut microbiota changes, creating a chronic state of gut "". To date, much of what we know about gut  was learned from 16S-based taxonomic profiling studies that reveal changes in the composition and abundance of various bacteria. However, this approach has limitations and creates taxonomic "blindspots". Notably, only bacteria can be analyzed. Thus, in this review we also discuss how the application of emerging sequencing technologies can improve our understanding of how the broader ecosystem in the gut is affected by SCI. Specifically, metagenomics will provide researchers with a more comprehensive look at post-injury changes in the gut virome (and mycome). Metagenomics also allows changes in microbe population dynamics to be linked to specific microbial functions that can affect the development and progression of metabolic disease, immune dysfunction and affective disorders after SCI. As these new tools become more readily available and used across the research community, the development of an "ecogenomic" toolbox will facilitate an Eco-Systems Biology approach to study the complex interplay along the spinal cord-gut-immune axis after SCI.Copyright © 2018.

M cells actively transport luminal antigens to the underlying lymphoid follicles to initiate an immune response. The molecular machinery of M-cell differentiation and function has been vigorously investigated over the last decade. Studies have shed light on the role of M cells in the mucosal immune system and have revealed that antigen uptake by M cells contributes to not only mucosal but also systemic immune responses. However, M-cell studies usually focus on infectious diseases; the contribution of M cells to autoimmune diseases has remained largely unexplored. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the intestinal  is implicated in multiple systemic diseases, including autoimmune diseases. This implies that the uptake of microorganisms by M cells in PPs may play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. We provide an outline of the current understanding of M-cell biology and subsequently discuss the potential contribution of M cells and PPs to the induction of systemic autoimmunity, beyond the mucosal immune response.Copyright © 2019 Kobayashi, Takahashi, Takano, Kimura and Hase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612122>Lower Airway Microbiota.</a></h2><p>During the last several years, the interest in the role of microbiota in human health has grown significantly. For many years, the lung was considered a sterile environment, and only recently, with the use of more sophisticated techniques, has it been demonstrated that colonization by a complex population of microorganisms in lower airways also occurs in healthy subjects; a predominance of some species of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes phyla and with a peculiar composition in some disease conditions, such as asthma, have been noted. Lung microbiota derives mainly from the higher airways microbiota. Although we have some information about the role of gut microbiota in modulation of immune system, less it is known about the connection between lung microbiota and local and systemic immunity. There is a correlation between altered microbiota composition and some diseases or chronic states; however, despite this correlation, it has not been clearly demonstrated whether the lung microbiota  could be a consequence or a cause of these diseases. We are far from a scientific approach to the therapeutic use of probiotics in airway diseases, but we are only at the starting point of a knowledge process in this fascinating field that could reveal important surprises, and randomized prospective studies in future could reveal more about the clinical possibilities for controlling lung microbiota.

However, its effects on obesity and related metabolic disorder have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we showed that the water extract of Caulis Spatholobi (WECS) has a significant effect in inhibiting body weight gain, decreasing adiposity, maintaining glucose homeostasis, reducing insulin resistance and improving hepatic steatosis in diet-introduced obesity (DIO) mice. Besides, the administration of WECS significantly increased the expression levels of genes involved in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and thermogenesis in DIO mice. Also, the activation of BAT treated with WECS was also confirmed in BAT primary cells. Mechanisms, the improvement of glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance may be related to the upregulated MAPK and AMPK pathways in white adipose tissue (WAT) and BAT. Notably, WECS also improved the obesity-induced gut microbiota , which induced an increase of anti-obesity and anti-diabetes related bacteria genus. In conclusion,  can ameliorate obesity through activating brown adipose tissue and modulating the composition of gut microbiota.

The current mainstay of therapy is a gluten-free diet (GFD). As novel therapies are being developed, complementary strategies are also being studied, such as modulation of the gut microbiome. The gut microbiota is involved in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in several chronic diseases. Intestinal  has been reported in CeD patients, untreated or treated with GFD, compared to healthy subjects. Several studies have identified differential bacterial populations associated with CeD patients and healthy subjects. However, it is still not clear if intestinal  is the cause or effect of CeD. Probiotics have also been considered as a strategy to modulate the gut microbiome to an anti-inflammatory state. However, there is a paucity of data to support their use in treating CeD.

Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on colonic tissue morphology, Th2 inflammatory factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut microbiota were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine colonic architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the tight-junction protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2 inflammatory factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial  therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585153>Impacts of novel duck reovirus infection on the composition of intestinal microbiota of Muscovy ducklings.</a></h2><p>Novel duck reovirus (NDRV) is pathogenic to young ducks, which is characterized by hemorrhagic spots and necrotic foci of the livers and necrotic foci of spleens. However, the effect of NDRV infection on the composition of the host's intestinal microbiota remains poorly understood. In this study, three-day-old Muscovy ducklings were inoculated with either the virulent NDRV strain NP03 or sterile Hank's solution. Through Illumina MiSeq sequencing, the whole cecal microbiota of healthy and NDRV infected ducklings was examined. The results showed that the gut microbiota was mainly dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidestes in both healthy and NDRV infected ducks. NDRV infection altered the relative abundance of bacteria. Specifically, families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae were remarkably reduced, whereas Escherichia_Shigella belonging to family Enterobacteriaceae was significantly increased. Collectively, NDRV infection in Muscovy ducks resulted in a shift of the gut microbiota, including a net loss of probiotic bacteria with a compensatory expansion of pathogenic bacteria.

Changes in the gut microbiota are being increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes. We hypothesized that inulin intervention during gestation and lactation improves glucose metabolism disorders in mouse offspring from high-fat diet (HD)-fed dams.  Female C57BL mice were fed a control diet or HD for 4 weeks before mating. After mating, pregnant mice were randomly divided into three groups through gestation and lactation: control diet (CD) group, HD group, and HD treated with inulin (HD-inulin) group. At weaning, glucose metabolic status was assessed. Gut microbial DNA from offspring cecal contents was isolated and processed for metagenomic shotgun sequencing, and taxonomic and functional profiling were performed.  Offspring from dams in the HD-inulin groups demonstrated reduced fasting blood glucose, decreased blood glucose area under the curve during the oral glucose tolerance test, and reduced fasting serum insulin and HOMA-IR compared to offspring from dams in the HD group. Nineteen differentially abundant bacterial species were identified between the HD-inulin and HD groups. The HD-inulin group displayed significantly greater abundances of , and  species and lower abundances of , and  species. Differentially abundant bacterial species among the three groups were involved in 38 metabolic pathways, including several glucose and lipid metabolism pathways.

However, the study about the characterizations of gut microbiome in lung cancer is limited. In this study, the fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 30 lung cancer patients who were divided into 3 groups based on different tumor biomarkers (cytokeratin 19 fragment, neuron specific enolase and carcinoembryonic antigen, respectively) and were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Each lung cancer group has characterized gut microbial community and presents an elimination, low-density, and loss of bacterial diversity microbial ecosystem compared to that of the healthy control. The microbiome structures in family and genera levels are more complex and significantly varied from each group presenting more different and special pathogen microbiome such as aceae, , a,  and fewer probiotic genera including  and .

However, the mycobiome has not been clearly implicated in tumorigenesis. Here we show that fungi migrate from the gut lumen to the pancreas, and that this is implicated in the pathogenesis of PDA. PDA tumours in humans and mouse models of this cancer displayed an increase in fungi of about 3,000-fold compared to normal pancreatic tissue. The composition of the mycobiome of PDA tumours was distinct from that of the gut or normal pancreas on the basis of alpha- and beta-diversity indices. Specifically, the fungal community that infiltrated PDA tumours was markedly enriched for Malassezia spp. in both mice and humans. Ablation of the mycobiome was protective against tumour growth in slowly progressive and invasive models of PDA, and repopulation with a Malassezia species-but not species in the genera Candida, Saccharomyces or Aspergillus-accelerated oncogenesis. We also discovered that ligation of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which binds to glycans of the fungal wall to activate the complement cascade, was required for oncogenic progression, whereas deletion of MBL or C3 in the extratumoral compartment-or knockdown of C3aR in tumour cells-were both protective against tumour growth. In addition, reprogramming of the mycobiome did not alter the progression of PDA in Mbl- (also known as Mbl2) or C3-deficient mice.

Frequent acute exacerbations of COPD are sudden worsening of symptoms, the nature of which is associated with bacterial or viral infections. However, one-third of exacerbations remain of undetermined origin. Although it is largely discussed and controversial, current guidelines recommend treatment of exacerbations with bronchodilators, antibiotics, and systemic corticosteroids; this is despite being associated with limited benefits in term of reducing mortality, side effects and without paying attention to the heterogeneity of these exacerbations. Increasing evidence suggests that the lung microbiota plays an important role in COPD and numerous studies have reported differences in the microbiota between healthy and disease states, as well as between exacerbations and stable COPD, leading to the hypothesis that frequent acute exacerbation is more likely to experience significant changes in lung microbiota composition. These findings will need further examination to explain the causes of lung , namely microbial composition, the host response, including the recruitment of eosinophils, lifestyle, diet, cigarette smoking and the use of antibiotics and corticosteroids. It is now important to assess: 1) Whether alterations in the lung microbiota contribute to disease pathogenesis, especially in exacerbations of unknown origin; 2) The role of eosinophils; and 3) Whether the microbiota of the lung can be manipulated therapeutically to improve COPD exacerbation event and disease progression. In summary, we hypothesize that the alterations of the lung microbiota may explain the undetermined origins of exacerbations and that there is an urgent need to facilitate the design of intervention studies that aim at conserving the lung microbial flora.Copyright 2019, Toraldo et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601676>Modulation of the fungal mycobiome is regulated by the chitin-binding receptor FIBCD1.</a></h2><p>Host-microbiota interactions are critical in regulating mammalian health and disease.

These data showed interpersonal differences in the composition of the microbiome and these differences suggest a link between the microbiome, the immune modulation, and the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. This research is particularly relevant in paediatrics, since allergic diseases are constantly increasing and there is evidence in the paediatric age that shows that the composition of the microbiome in the foetal and neonatal period plays a key role in the development of the immune system: vaginal delivery, breastfeeding, childhood spent in rural environments and/or in contact with animals result in a greater biodiversity of the microbiome with the presence of protective species that reduce the activation of Th2 lymphocytes, involved in allergic reactions. Further studies are necessary to better understand the microbiota role in the pathogenesis of atopy in order to understand if specific probiotics and prebiotics, administered orally or topically, can affect the microbiota composition and modulate immune system functions, producing a therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergic diseases. This narrative review analysed the available literature regarding the correlation between the microbiome and the development of allergic diseases and with special focus on paediatric studies.

Microbial species linked to CRC include certain strains of ,   and   amongst others. Whether these microbes are merely passive dwellers exploiting the tumour environment, or rather, active protagonists in the carcinogenic process is the subject of much research. The incidence of chemically-induced tumours in mice models varies, depending upon the presence or absence of these microorganisms, thus strongly suggesting influences on disease causation. Putative mechanistic explanations differentially link these strains to DNA damage, inflammation, aberrant cell behaviour and immune suppression. In the future, modulating the composition and metabolic activity of this microbial community may have a role in prevention and therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602221> of Gram-negative gut microbiota and the associated serum lipopolysaccharide exacerbates inflammation in type 2 diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent endotoxin present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, causes chronic immune responses associated with inflammation. In the present study, the association between LPS and the  of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut microbiome was determined in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (T2DM-CKD; stages 4 and 5, not on dialysis) compared with healthy individuals. Microbiome diversity was analyzed in patients with T2DM-CKD and healthy controls by sequencing the hypervariable sub-regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene from stool samples. Serum samples were assayed by ELISA for LPS, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL6) and endothelin-1. A total of four gut Gram-negative phyla (Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia) were identified in the gut microbiome of the T2DM-CKD and control groups. Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in patients with T2DM-CKD when compared with controls (P<0.05). The levels of serum LPS were significantly increased in patients with T2DM-CKD compared with controls (P<0.05). Elevated serum LPS was significantly correlated with increased levels of TNFα, IL6 and CRP. The  of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut microbiome of patients with T2DM-CKD may contribute to the elevated serum levels of LPS and the consequential effects on the inflammatory biomarkers in these patients. The association between the  of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut microbiome of patients with T2DM-CKD, increased LPS levels and the effects on inflammatory biomarkers may provide insight into potential diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the treatment of T2DM-CKD.Copyright: © Salguero et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587913>Symposium review: The uterine microbiome associated with the development of uterine disease in dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Until 2010, our knowledge of the uterine microbiome in cows that developed uterine disease relied almost exclusively on culture-dependent studies and mostly included cows with clinical endometritis (i.e., with purulent uterine discharge). Those studies consistently found a strong positive correlation between Trueperella pyogenes and clinical endometritis, whereas other pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Bacteroides spp. were also commonly cocultured. In contrast, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Bacillus spp. were usually isolated from healthy cows. Starting in 2010, culture-independent studies using PCR explored the microbiome of cows with metritis and clinical endometritis, and observed that E. coli was a pioneer pathogen that predisposed cows to infection with F. necrophorum, which was strongly associated with metritis, and to infection with T. pyogenes, which was strongly associated with clinical endometritis. Starting in 2011, culture-independent studies using metagenomic sequencing expanded our knowledge of the uterine microbiome. It has been shown that cows have bacteria in the uterus even before calving, they have an established uterine microbiome within 20 min of calving, and that the microbiome structure is identical between cows that develop metritis and healthy cows until 2 d postpartum, after which the bacterial structure of cows that developed metritis deviates in favor of greater relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria and lesser relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Tenericutes. The shift in the uterine microbiome in cows that develop metritis is characterized by a loss of heterogeneity and a decrease in bacterial richness. At the genus level, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium have the strongest association with metritis. At the species level, we observed that Bacteroides pyogenes, Porphyromonas levii, and Helcococcus ovis were potential emerging uterine pathogens. Finally, we have shown that the hematogenous route is a viable route of uterine infection with uterine pathogens. Herein, we propose that metritis is associated with a  of the uterine microbiota characterized by decreased richness, and an increase in Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria, particularly Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Moreover, once thought as merely a systemic effector, RAS components exist within tissues. The highest tissue concentrations of ACE2 mRNA are located in the gut making it an important target for altering RAS function. Indeed, genetically engineered recombinant probiotics are promising treatment strategies offering delivery of therapeutic proteins with precision. An Ang(1-7) secreting Lactobacillus paracasei (LP) or LP-A has been described for regulation of diabetes and hypertension; however, we are the first to our knowledge to propose this paradigm as it relates to aging. In this Research Practice manuscript, we provide proof of concept for using this technology in a well-characterized rodent model of aging: the Fisher344 x Brown Norway Rat (F344BN). Our primary findings suggest that LP-A increases circulating levels of Ang(1-7) both acutely and chronically (after 8 or 28 treatment days) when administered 3 or 7x/week over 4 weeks. Our future preclinical studies will explore the impact of this treatment on gut and other age-sensitive distal tissues such as brain and muscle.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, chronic treatment with GCs in clinical settings has a series of side effects, such as metabolic disorders, gut microbiota  and neurological impairment. Therefore, searching for a functional substance that can alleviate these side effects is greatly meaningful to clinical patients. Crocin is the main active ingredient of saffron, which has been reported to have numerous pharmacological activities. However, the action of crocin-I, one major member of the crocin family, on the physiological mediation in the individuals receiving GC treatment remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of crocin-I on lipid metabolism and the gut microbiota in a mouse model of chronic corticosterone (CORT) treatment. Our findings showed that crocin-I reduced the levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol and the ratio of low density lipoprotein to high density lipoprotein in the serum of CORT-treated mice. In addition, transcriptome analysis revealed that crocin-I was effective in mediating the amelioration of lipid metabolism, mainly in fatty acid metabolism and steroid biosynthesis in CORT-treated mice. Moreover, metabolome analysis demonstrated that crocin-I could restore the disturbed metabolites in the liver of CORT-treated mice, most of which are long-chain fatty acids. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of 16s rRNA revealed that crocin-I could mitigate the  of the gut microbiota caused by CORT at a dose of 40 mg kg-1, by resulting in a significant increase in the alpha diversity of the microbes in the cecal contents and a significant reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes, whereas by increasing the abundance of Bacteroidetes.

Pharmacotherapy for metabolic diseases involves the modulation of gut microbiota, which is suggested to be a potential therapeutic target. In this study, the modulation of gut microbiota by statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs: atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) was investigated in an aged mouse model of high-fat diet-induced obesity, and the association between gut microbiota and immune responses was described. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin significantly increased the abundance of the genera , , and  Moreover, the abundance of these genera was correlated with the inflammatory response, including levels of IL-1β and TGFβ1 in the ileum. In addition, oral fecal microbiota transplantation with fecal material collected from rosuvastatin-treated mouse groups improved hyperglycemia. From these results, the effect of statins on metabolic improvements could be explained by altered gut microbiota.

Meanwhile, the host immune response also plays an important role in the disease. Notably, interleukin (IL)-33 released from damaged or necrotic intestinal epithelial cells facilitates Th2 responses. However, causal relationships between the gut and oral  and food allergy remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed effects of gut and oral  on development of food allergy.

Intestinal T cells from the mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. Salivary IgA levels were quantified by ELISA, and IgA-bound oral bacteria were detected by flow cytometry. Among fecal bacteria,  sp. increased in the feces of allergic mice and induced  expression in colon-26 cells. Orally administered  JCM1658 exacerbated systemic allergic symptoms and reduced intestinal Th17 cells. Salivary IgA and IgA-bound oral bacteria increased in the allergic mice.

Negative shifts in gut microbiota profiles, also known as , may be implicated in the development of chronic disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Adhesion molecule-dependent recruitment of immune cells to the gut is an important step in IBD pathogenesis. The adhesion molecule β7 integrin contributes to the development of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), intestinal immune cell homing, and immune responses and is known to promote intestinal inflammation. Although many studies underlined the role of the gut microbiota in shaping the mucosal immune system, studies on the influence of the host immune system on the microbiota are rare, especially in homeostasis. We addressed this question via comparative 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis of fecal microbial communities from wild-type and β7 integrin-deficient mice, the latter being characterized by a compromised GALT. Besides subtle changes in relative abundances of  spp. and unknown members of the families  and , there was altogether no major difference in microbiota profiles in β7 integrin-deficient mice vs. wild-type littermates. This indicates that, in conditions of homeostasis, there is only a minor influence of the host immune system on the fecal microbiota in our mouse model, stressing the potential importance of pathological factors for  development.Copyright © 2019 Babbar, Hitch, Pabst, Clavel, Hübel, Eswaran, Wagner and Schippers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591345>The Role of Dietary Fiber in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: A Feasibility Study.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids are microbial metabolites that have been shown to be key regulators of the gut-joint axis in animal models.

HIV infection may be associated with shifts in the vaginal microbiome. We characterized microbial communities in vaginal swabs collected between 16-20 gestational weeks in the Zambian Preterm Birth Prevention Study to investigate whether HIV and its treatment alter the microbiome in pregnancy. We quantified relative abundance and diversity of bacterial taxa by whole-genome shotgun sequencing and identified community state types (CST) by hierarchical clustering. Associations between exposures-HIV serostatus (HIV+ vs HIV-) and preconceptional ART (ART+ vs ART-)-and microbiome characteristics were tested with rank-sum, and by linear and logistic regression, accounting for sampling by inverse-probability weighting. Of 261 vaginal swabs, 256 (98%) had evaluable sequences; 98 (38%) were from HIV+ participants, 55 (56%) of whom had preconceptional ART exposure. Major CSTs were dominated by: L. crispatus (CST 1; 17%), L.] iners (CST 3; 32%), Gardnerella vaginalis (CST 4-I; 37%), G. vaginalis & Atopobium vaginae (CST 4-II; 5%), and other mixed anaerobes (CST 4-III; 9%).

Previous investigations have observed a higher prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in patients with GPA, and chronic nasal carriage has been linked with an increased risk of disease relapse. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated changes in the nasal microbiota including a detailed analysis of Staphylococcus spp. by shotgun metagenomics in patients with active and inactive granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Shotgun metagenomic sequence data were also used to identify protein-encoding genes within the SEED database, and the abundance of proteins then correlated with the presence of bacterial species on an annotated heatmap.The presence of S. aureus in the nose as assessed by culture was more frequently detected in patients with active GPA (66.7%) compared with inactive GPA (34.1%). Beta diversity analysis of nasal microbiota by bacterial 16S rRNA profiling revealed a different composition between GPA patients and healthy controls (P = 0.039). Beta diversity analysis of shotgun metagenomic sequence data for Staphylococcus spp. revealed a different composition between active GPA patients and healthy controls and disease controls (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0023, respectively), and between healthy controls and inactive GPA patients and household controls (P = 0.0168 and P = 0.0168, respectively). Patients with active GPA had a higher abundance of S. aureus, mirroring the culture data, while healthy controls had a higher abundance of S. epidermidis. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, generally assumed to be a pathogen of cats and dogs, showed an abundance of 13% among the Staphylococcus spp. in our cohort. During long-term follow-up of patients with inactive GPA at baseline, a higher S. aureus abundance was not associated with an increased relapse risk. Functional analyses identified ten SEED protein subsystems that differed between the groups. Most significant associations were related to chorismate synthesis and involved in the vitamin B pathway.Our data revealed a distinct  of the nasal microbiota in GPA patients compared with disease and healthy controls. Metagenomic sequencing demonstrated that this  in active GPA patients is manifested by increased abundance of S. aureus and a depletion of S. epidermidis, further demonstrating the antagonist relationships between these species.

We examined the effects of lactobacilli and female sex hormones on the barrier functions and innate immune responses of primary endometrial genital epithelial cells (GECs). Two probiotic strains,  RC-14 and  GR-1, were tested, as were sex hormones estrogen (E2), progesterone (P4), and the hormonal contraceptive medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Our results demonstrate that probiotic lactobacilli enhance barrier function without affecting cytokines. Treatment of GECs with MPA resulted in reduced barrier function. In contrast, E2 treatment enhanced barrier function and reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Comparison of hormones plus lactobacilli as a pre-treatment prior to HIV exposure revealed a dominant effect of lactobacilli in preventing loss of barrier function by GECs. In summary, the combination of E2 and lactobacilli had the best protective effect against HIV-1 seen by enhancement of barrier function and reduction in proinflammatory cytokines.

In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut , and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty acids in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut microbiota in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut , and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller. More research is warranted to clearly define how dietary milk SM influences lipid metabolism, gut microbiota, and inflammation in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, the most common cause of death in NAFLD remains to be CVD. Several mechanisms have been suggested to be responsible for associating FLD with CVD through several mechanisms including low-grade systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, adipokines, endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipotoxicity and microbiota  which may also be influenced by other factors such as genetic and epigenetic variations. Despite of all this evidence, the exact mechanisms of how FLD can causally contribute to CVD are not fully elucidated and much remains unknown. Moreover, the current literature supports the increasing evidence associating FLD with several cardiovascular (CV) adverse events including coronary artery disease, increased subclinical atherosclerosis risk, structural alterations mainly left ventricular hypertrophy, increased epicardial fat thickness, valvular calcifications including aortic valve sclerosis and mitral annular calcification and functional cardiac modifications mainly diastolic dysfunction in addition to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrythmias and conduction defects including atrioventricular blocks and bundle branch blocks. Patients with FLD should be evaluated and managed accordingly in order to prevent further complications. Possible management methods include non-pharmacological strategies including life style modifications, pharmacological therapies as well as surgical management. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms linking FLD with an increased CV risk, in addition to associated CV adverse events and current management modalities.Copyright © 2019 Ismaiel and Dumitraşcu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586566>Influence of the Gut Microbiome, Diet, and Environment on Risk of Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Researchers have discovered associations between elements of the intestinal microbiome (including specific microbes, signaling pathways, and microbiota-related metabolites) and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is unclear whether changes in the intestinal microbiome contribute to development of sporadic CRC or result from it. Changes in the intestinal microbiome can mediate or modify the effects of environmental factors on risk of CRC. Factors that affect risk of CRC also affect the intestinal microbiome, including overweight and obesity; physical activity; and dietary intake of fiber, whole grains, and red and processed meat. These factors alter microbiome structure and function, along with the metabolic and immune pathways that mediate CRC development. We review epidemiologic and laboratory evidence for the influence of the microbiome, diet, and environmental factors on CRC incidence and outcomes. Based on these data, features of the intestinal microbiome might be used for CRC screening and modified for chemoprevention and treatment. Integrated prospective studies are urgently needed to investigate these strategies.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

While bacteria-derived products can induce aversive responses and influence pain perception, recent work suggests that "abnormal" microbiota is associated with neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we review how the gut microbiota modulates afferent sensory neurons function and pain, highlighting the role of the microbiota/gut/brain axis in the control of behaviors and neurological diseases. We outline the changes in gut microbiota, known as , and their influence on painful gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, both direct host/microbiota interaction that implicates activation of "pain-sensing" neurons by metabolites, or indirect communication via immune activation is discussed. Finally, treatment options targeting the gut microbiota, including pre- or probiotics, will be proposed. Further studies on microbiota/nervous system interaction should lead to the identification of novel microbial ligands and host receptor-targeted drugs, which could ultimately improve chronic pain management and well-being.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569428>Advanced Organ-on-a-Chip Devices to Investigate Liver Multi-Organ Communication: Focus on Gut, Microbiota and Brain.</a></h2><p>The liver is a key organ that can communicate with many other districts of the human body. In the last few decades, much interest has focused on the interaction between the liver and the gut microbiota, with their reciprocal influence on biosynthesis pathways and the integrity the intestinal epithelial barrier.  or liver disorders lead to0 epithelial barrier dysfunction, altering membrane permeability to toxins. Clinical and experimental evidence shows that the permeability hence the delivery of neurotoxins such as LPS, ammonia and salsolinol contribute to neurological disorders. These findings suggested multi-organ communication between the gut microbiota, the liver and the brain. With a view to in vitro modeling this liver-based multi-organ communication, we describe the latest advanced liver-on-a-chip devices and discuss the need for new organ-on-a-chip platforms for in vitro modeling the in vivo multi-organ connection pathways in physiological and pathological situations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624009>Nutritional and dietary strategy in the clinical care of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease have been increasing for decades and IBD has become a worldwide disease. Epidemiology studies demonstrated higher incidence rates in the more westernized countries. The change of habitual diets in these countries is perceived as the reason for the development of IBD. Besides, molecular biological studies showed some pathogenic substances produced after digestion of daily diet decrease the diversity of intestinal microbiota and cause  of microbiome. Then, chronic inflammation occurs in some genetically susceptible subjects and IBD developed. As a result, many researchers started to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nutrients and dietary intervention on the clinical course and pathogenesis of IBD. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the inflammatory process are discovered gradually. The undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and inflammation occurs by altering colonic microbiome. ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty acids due to its less pro-inflammatory properties. High fibers produce more short-chain fatty acids in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic microbiota. Moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. Low FODMAP is recommended in IBS and is also suggested in patients of IBD with IBS-like symptoms. Specific Carbohydrate Diet was designed for celiac disease at first and is proved to be effective to decrease inflammation and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric CD in many literatures. Paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. These findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level. Some more well-designed studies with randomization and double-blind are needed and the primary endpoints should be more focused on the decrease of inflammation in pathology and mucosal healing in endoscopy instead of relief of the symptoms.Copyright © 2019.

We then characterised the effect of a single human stool transfer (HST) on a humanised model of DSS-induced colitis. Colonic and faecal microbial communities were analysed using the 16S rRNA approach and clinical manifestations were assessed in a longitudinal setting.The microbial community of rats showed greater similarity to that of humans, while the microbiome of mice showed less similarity to that of humans. Moreover, rats captured more human microbial species than mice after a single HST. Using the rat model, we showed that HST compensated faecal  by restoring alpha-diversity and by increasing the relative abundance of health-related microbial genera. To some extent, HST also modulated the microbial composition of colonic tissue. These faecal and colonic microbial communities alterations led to a relative restoration of colon length, and a significant decrease in both epithelium damage and disease severity. Remarkably, stopping inflammation by removing DSS before HST caused a faster and greater recovery of both microbiome and clinical manifestation features.Our results indicate that the rat outperforms the mouse as a model for human microbiota engraftment and show that the efficacy of HST can be enhanced when inflammation stimulation is withdrawn. Finally, our findings support a new therapeutic strategy based on the use FMT combined with anti-inflammatory drugs.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

The developed cervical cancer can lead to changes in the vaginal microbiota. The aim of our study is to determine the vaginal microbiota changes at women with FIGO I stage cervical cancer. We conducted an open, single-site survey in the Department of Gynecology of the Military Medical Academy in Sofia, Bulgaria, from 2014 to 2019 year. The study included a total of 32 women aged 38-55 years with clinical and pathology established cervical cancer (FIGO I stage). The underlying vaginal DNA microbiological test indicated presence or absence of bacterial vaginosis, other vaginal infections or normal vaginal microbiota. Of 32 (100%) women enrolled in our study, 19 (59.4%) was with FIGO IA stage cervical cancer and 13 (40.6%) with IB stage. Disturbances of vaginal microbiota in we found at 23 (71.9%) of women with cervical cancer included in our study. At the rest of 9 (28.1%) women we found out normal vaginal microbiota. Bacterial vaginosis was determined clinically and microbiologically in 15 (46.9%) women enrolled in the study. Aerobic vaginitis caused by Streptococcus species we establish at 4 (12.5%) of women. Trichomonas vaginalis infection have 1 (3.1%) women and Candida Albicans the last one 1 (3.1%) from this group with disturbed vaginal microbial balance. Bacterial dysbacteriosis, characterized by a predominance of Gardnerella vaginalis alone or in complex with other anaerobic bacteria, aerobic vaginitis and other sexually transmitted vaginal pathogens from one side and a concomitant paucity of vaginal Lactobacillus species may be an HPV-dependent cofactor for cervical neoplasia development.

The V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified, followed by sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Bioinformatics analysis for microbial classification and functional assessment was performed to assess bladder microbiome diversity and variations.The predominant phylum in both tissues was Proteobacteria. The cancerous tissues exhibited lower species richness and diversity. Beta diversity significantly differed between the cancerous and normal tissues. Lower relative abundances of the microbial genera Lactobacillus, Prevotella_9, as well as Ruminococcaceae were observed, whereas those of Cupriavidus spp., an unknown genus of family Brucellaceae, and Acinetobacter, Anoxybacillus, Escherichia-Shigella, Geobacillus, Pelomonas, Ralstonia, and Sphingomonas were higher in the cancerous tissues. These findings indicate that these genera may be potentially utilized as biomarkers for bladder cancer. PICRUSt analysis revealed that several pathways involved in the metabolism of harmful chemical compounds were enriched in the cancer tissues, thereby providing evidence that environmental factors are strongly associated with bladder cancer etiology.This is the first study that has described and analyzed the dysbiotic motifs of urinary microbiota in the parenchymatous tissues of bladder cancer via 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Heart failure (HF) is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases worldwide; however, whether GM  participates in the development of HF remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the specific changes in GM composition and function in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced HF in rats.The rats were divided into C (control), 4w-HF (ISO, 2.5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, intraperitoneally), and 2w-HF (ISO, 2.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, intraperitoneally) groups. The cardiac structure and function in rats were assessed, and metagenomic analyses were then performed. Compared with the healthy control group, we found that the Shannon diversity index and microbial gene count in the 4w-HF and 2w-HF groups was drastically decreased. High-throughput sequencing showed that the three groups differed in intestinal bacterial community composition. Overgrowth of bacteria, such as Prevotella, was observed in the 4w-HF group, with reduced growth of bacteria, such as Roseburia, Lactobacillus, and Butyrivibrio, associated with healthy status compared with the C group on the genus level. Concomitant with the alteration of GM composition, underrepresentation of health-linked microbial function was observed in both the 4w-HF and 2w-HF groups compared with the C group.Iso-induced HF rats showed a significant decrease in the diversity and richness of the intestinal microbiome, with a downregulation of the key intestinal bacterial groups and overgrowth of bacteria considered to be involved in inflammatory responses as well as a decrease in health-linked microbial function. Our data indicated that altered GM may be a potential player in the pathogenesis and progression of HF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644312>Effects of Hyperoxia on Alveolar and Pulmonary Vascular Development in Germ Free Mice.</a></h2><p>Airway microbial  is associated with subsequent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) development in very preterm infants. However, the relationship of airway microbiome in normal pulmonary development has not been defined. To better understand the role of the airway microbiome, we compared normal and abnormal alveolar and pulmonary vascular development in mice with or without a microbiome. We hypothesized that the lungs of germ-free (GF) mice would have an exaggerated phenotypic response to hyperoxia compared to non germ-free (NGF) mice. Using a novel gnotobiotic hyperoxia chamberGF and NGF mice were exposed to either normoxia or hyperoxia. Alveolar morphometry, pulmonary mechanics, echocardiograms, inflammatory markers and measures of pulmonary hypertension were studied. GF and NGF mice in normoxiashowed no difference whereas GF mice in hyperoxia showed protected lung structure and mechanics and decreased markers of inflammation compared to NGF mice. Compared to NGF mice, GF mice lungs show relatively protected lung structure and better function in hyperoxic conditions. We speculate that the presence of pathogenic bacteria in NGF mice may play a role in BPD pathogenesis by regulating the pro-inflammatory signaling and neutrophilic inflammation in lungs. Manipulation of the airway microbiome may be a potential therapeutic intervention in BPD and other lung diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607571>Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection in Taiwan: Establishment and implementation.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) remains a major public health issue, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has become one of the standard therapies for recurrent or refractory CDI. When compared to medical therapies, such as metronidazole or vancomycin, FMT has a high rate of treatment response with acceptable safety and efficiency. Following promulgation of the amendments in September 2018 in Taiwan, FMT has been indicated for recurrent or refractory CDI. The Taiwan Microbiota Consortium contributed to the Taiwan FMT Expert Consensus, which established basic norms and stipulated essential principles, including the indications for transplantation, eligible locations and personnel, donor screening policies, fecal sample handling, and post-FMT follow-up. However, establishing an eligible FMT team in a qualified hospital remains a clinical challenge, and the requirement for facilities and well-screened donors impedes the implementation of FMT. In this review, we aim to provide domestic FMT teams with explicit instructions to facilitate realization and increase the practice of FMT.

Its profile can be modulated by a number of dietary factors, although few publications have focused on the effects of what we drink. The present review performed a systematic review of trials and mechanistic studies examining the effects of tea consumption, its associated compounds and their effects on the gut microbiome. Registered articles were searched up to 10th September 2019, in the PubMed and Cochrane library databases along with references of original articles. Human trials were graded using the Jadad scale to assess quality. Altogether 24 publications were included in the main review-six were human trials and 18 mechanistic studies. Of these, the largest body of evidence related to green tea with up to 1000 mL daily (4-5 cups) reported to increase proportions of .

CE can often be associated with intestinal  and thus administration of probiotic or synbiotic products may provide a useful tool for the management of some of these patients.  (EF) is a probiotic strain included in a commercially available synbiotic for small animals, however its impact on the microbial communities in dogs with FRD has not yet been evaluated.  The administration of a synbiotic will lead to a significant difference of the fecal microbial composition and/or diversity in dogs with FRD, and these changes are not attributable to diet change alone.  Twelve dogs with FRD fed a hydrolyzed protein diet received either a synbiotic (EF, fructooligosaccharides, gum Arabic) or placebo. Fecal samples were taken before and 6 weeks into treatment. Fecal samples were also acquired from 8 healthy dogs before and 6 weeks after being switched to the same hydrolyzed protein diet as their sole food.  Bacterial DNA was extracted from fecal samples and next generation sequencing based on the 16S rRNA genes was performed. Microbial composition and diversity between groups were compared using QIIME.  There was a small increase in species diversity in the feces of dogs with FRD treated with synbiotics. However, there were no significant differences in microbial community composition before and after 6 weeks in either the synbiotic or placebo treated dogs with FRD or the healthy dogs. In all groups, large individual variations were observed.  No changes in microbial composition were observed in diseased or healthy dogs with diet change alone.

In addition, TFQ treatment reverses HFD-induced gut , as indicated by the reduction of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, the increase of genera Akkermansia and Alistipes, and the decrease of genera Dubosiella, Faecalibaculum, and Lactobacillus.These findings support a prebiotic role of TFQ as a dietary supplement for the intervention of gut  and obesity-related metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628395>Impact of Early Life Antibiotic Exposure and Neonatal Hyperoxia on the Murine Microbiome and Lung Injury.</a></h2><p>Cross talk between the intestinal microbiome and the lung and its role in lung health remains unknown. Perinatal exposure to antibiotics disrupts the neonatal microbiome and may have an impact on the preterm lung. We hypothesized that perinatal antibiotic exposure leads to long-term intestinal  and increased alveolar simplification in a murine hyperoxia model. Pregnant C57BL/6 wild type dams and neonatal mice were treated with antibiotics before and/or immediately after delivery. Control mice received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Neonatal mice were exposed to 95% oxygen for 4 days or room air. Microbiome analysis was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Pulmonary alveolarization and vascularization were analyzed at postnatal day (PND) 21. Perinatal antibiotic exposure modified intestinal beta diversity but not alpha diversity in neonatal mice. Neonatal hyperoxia exposure altered intestinal beta diversity and relative abundance of commensal bacteria in antibiotic treated mice. Hyperoxia disrupted pulmonary alveolarization and vascularization at PND 21; however, there were no differences in the degree of lung injury in antibiotic treated mice compared to vehicle treated controls.

In particular, the lack of diversity in the gut microbiota has been associated with complications of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), such as infections, acute graft-versus-host disease and relapse of primary disease, which lead to a poor prognosis. However, few studies have serially examined the composition of the intestinal microbiota after HSCT. In this study, we demonstrated, using next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene, combined with uniFrac distance analysis, that the intestinal microbiota of patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT substantially differed from that of healthy controls and recipients of autologous transplants. Faecal samples were obtained daily throughout the clinical course, before and after transplantation. Notably, the proportions of Bifidobacterium and genera categorized as butyrate-producing bacteria were significantly lower in patients with allogeneic HSCT than in healthy controls. Furthermore, among allogeneic transplant recipients, a subgroup with a preserved microbiota composition showed a benign course, whereas patients with a skewed microbiota showed a high frequency of complications and mortality after transplantation.

Besides bacteria, microbiota comprises yeasts, archaea, protists and viruses, neglected actors in inflammatory bowel disease-associated microbiota. In the past, a great limitation in studying microbiota composition was the low sensitivity of sequencing technologies and that few computational approaches were sufficient to thoroughly analyse the whole microbiome. However, new cutting-edge technologies in nucleic acid sequencing, -omics analysis and the innovative statistics and bioinformatics pipelines made possible more sensitive and accurate metagenomics, ultimately identifying novel players in intestinal inflammation, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, that together form the gut virome. The discovery of peculiar inflammatory bowel disease-associated microbial strains will not only shed new light on inflammatory bowel disease aetiogenesis, they may also support the development of novel therapeutic strategies not merely treating symptoms, but precisely counteracting the primary cause of chronic intestinal inflammation.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628992>Exercise, diet and stress as modulators of gut microbiota: Implications for neurodegenerative diseases.</a></h2><p>The last decade has witnessed an exponentially growing interest in gut microbiota and the gut-brain axis in health and disease. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical research indicate that gut microbiota, and their associated microbiomes, may influence pathogenic processes and thus the onset and progression of various diseases, including neurological and psychiatric disorders. In fact, gut  (microbiota dysregulation) has been associated with a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and motor neuron disease, as well as multiple sclerosis. The gut microbiota constitutes a dynamic microbial system constantly challenged by many biological variables, including environmental factors. Since the gut microbiota constitute a changeable and experience-dependent ecosystem, they provide potential therapeutic targets that can be modulated as new interventions for -related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews the evidence for environmental modulation of gut microbiota and its relevance to brain disorders, exploring in particular the implications for neurodegenerative diseases. We will focus on three major environmental factors that are known to influence the onset and progression of those diseases, namely exercise, diet and stress. Further exploration of environmental modulation, acting via both peripheral (e.g. gut microbiota and associated metabolic dysfunction or 'metabolopathy') and central (e.g. direct effects on CNS neurons and glia) mechanisms, may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches, such as enviromimetics, for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2018.

The gastrointestinal tract microbiota includes bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses, and archaea which collectively comprise a dynamic community prone to alterations via influences such as the environment, illness, and metabolic processes. The idea that the host's diet possesses characteristics that could potentially alter microbiota composition is a novel notion. We hypothesize that a high fat diet leads to the alteration of the gastrointestinal microbiota composition and that metabolic transformation of the compound trimethylamine into trimethylamine-N-oxide promotes vasculopathy such as atherosclerosis and affects cardiovascular functionality. Furthermore, we hypothesize that treatment with probiotics will restore the homeostatic environment (eubiosis) of the gastrointestinal tract.©2019 Hardin et al. Published by IMR press.

High-risk HLA molecules bind specific fragments of gluten or the islet self-antigen(s) and present these antigens to antigen-responsive T cells. In an appropriate proinflammatory environment, the autoimmune response results in destruction of the intestinal enterocyte and/or the pancreatic beta cell. Environmental factors have been implicated in the etiology of T1D and CD because (1) identical twins are only partially concordant for these disorders and (2) incidence rates of T1D and CD have been steadily rising for decades. Prospective studies in infants genetically predisposed to T1D and CD showed that antibody positivity to both disorders begins in the first 1-3 years of life. Viral infections and early exposure to gluten or cow's milk in the infant diet have been implicated in disease pathogenesis. However, delaying introduction of gluten in the infant diet until 12 months of age had no impact on the development of islet or celiac autoimmunity. Weaning nursing infants to hydrolyzed infant formula had no impact on the development of T1D. Viral infections have been suspected of playing a role in T1D pathogenesis for decades. A large international prospective study (TEDDY) has shown increased risk of T1D autoimmunity particularly when >5 respiratory infections or febrile infections have occurred in the 9 months preceding the appearance of islet antibodies. Provocative data in animal models of T1D suggest the microbiome may play an important role in the pathogenesis of T1D. Breastfeeding, diet, infections, antibiotics, and method of birth alter the composition of the microbiome. Human data indicate subtle differences in the microbiome of children with T1D autoimmunity, while intestinal  has been clearly demonstrated in CD. Alterations of the integrity of the intestinal mucosa plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CD, and the NOD mouse model suggests an important role of a leaky intestinal epithelium in T1D as well. Key Message: Immunogenetics and the environment are closely interrelated in the pathogenesis of T1D and CD. Large well-designed prospective studies in at-risk populations informed by scientifically rigorous studies in animal models are likely to have the greatest impact on our understanding of the complex pathogenesis of these detrimental autoimmune disorders.© 2019 S.

While pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a well-defined disease with established guidelines, Eosinophilic Gastritis (EoG), Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EoGE) and Eosinophilic Colitis (EoC) remain a clinical enigma with evidence based on limited anecdotal case reports. Large cross-sectional studies in US defined a prevalence of EoG and EoGE ranging from 1,5 to 6,4/100.000 and from 2,7 to 8,3/100.000 subjects respectively, while prevalence of EoC ranges from 1,7 to 3,5/100.000 subjects. Regarding the pathogenesis, it is hypothesized that EGIDs result from the interplay between genetic predisposition, intestinal  and environmental triggers. Clinically, EGIDs might present with different and nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms depending on the involved intestinal tract and the extension of eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. The diagnosis of EGIDs requires: 1. recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, 2. increased eosinophils for high power field in biopsy specimens, 3. absence of secondary causes of gastrointestinal eosinophilia. No validated guidelines are available on the clinical management of patients with EGIDs. Evidence from case reports and small uncontrolled case series suggests the use of dietary and corticosteroids as the first-line treatments. Considering the clinical follow-up of EGIDs, three different patterns of disease course are identified: single flare, recurring course-disease and chronic course-disease.

We set out to (1) further define the key microbial characteristics driving disease, and (2) examine the effects of tumour necrosis factor-inhibitor (TNFi) therapy upon the microbiome.The stools from a case-control cohort of 250 Han-Chinese subjects underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. All subjects were genotyped using the Illumina CoreExome SNP microarray.Previous reports of gut  in AS were reconfirmed and several notable bacterial species and functional categories were differentially abundant. TNFi therapy was correlated with a restoration the perturbed microbiome observed in untreated AS cases to that of healthy controls, including several important bacterial species that have been previously associated with AS and other related diseases. Enrichment of bacterial peptides homologous to HLA-B27-presented epitopes was observed in the stools of patients with AS, suggesting that either HLA-B27 fails to clear these or that they are involved in driving HLA-B27-associated immune reactions. TNFi therapy largely restored the perturbed microbiome observed in untreated AS cases to that of healthy controls, including several important bacterial species that have been previously associated with AS and other related diseases. TNFi therapy of patients with AS was also associated with a reduction of potentially arthritogenic bacterial peptides, relative to untreated patients.These findings emphasise the key role that the gut microbiome plays in driving the pathogenesis of AS and highlight potential therapeutic and/or preventative targets.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Exposure to the widely-used pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF), can lead to  and alter the levels of metabolites produced by the microbiota, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This study was aimed at assessing the contribution of the APOE genotype and early exposure to CPF on gut microbiota and SCFA in brain. For it, C57BL/6, apoE3-and apoE4-TR mice were orally exposed to CPF from postnatal day (PND) 10 to PND 15. Microbiota in the gut and SCFA in the brain were assessed at PND 15 after CPF exposure. Differences between genotypes at different taxonomic levels were found, A. muciniphila presented greater abundance in APOE4 genotype, but was reduced by CPF exposure. APOE and CPF influenced cerebral SCFAs, with APOE3 genotype showing the highest levels of acetic, propionic and butyric acids and CPF exposure inducing the highest levels of isovaleric and 4-methylvaleric acids. These results provide further knowledge about gut microbiota and cerebral SCFAs composition at early ages and their modulation by APOE and postnatal CPF exposure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Control mice received a standard diet, whereas obese mice were fed HFD. The treatment was followed for 5 weeks, and animal body weight periodically assessed. At the end of the treatment, metabolic plasma analysis (including lipid profile) as well as glucose and insulin levels were performed. The HFD-induced inflammatory status was studied in liver and fat, by determining the RNA expression of different inflammatory mediators by qPCR; also, different markers of intestinal epithelial barrier function were determined in colonic tissue by qPCR. Additionally, flow cytometry of immune cells from adipose tissue, endothelial dysfunction in aortic rings as well as gut microbiota composition were evaluated. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to antibiotic-treated mice fed with HFD was performed.OLE administration reduced body weight gain, basal glycaemia and insulin resistance, and showed improvement in plasma lipid profile when compared with HFD-fed mice. The extract significantly ameliorated the HFD-induced altered expression of key adipogenic genes, like PPARs, adiponectin and leptin receptor, in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the extract reduced the RNA expression of Tnf-α, Il-1β, Il-6 in liver and adipose tissue, thus improving the tissue inflammatory status associated to obesity. The flow cytometry analysis in adipose tissue corroborated these observations. Additionally, the characterization of the colonic microbiota by sequencing showed that OLE administration was able to counteract the  associated to obesity.

The present study investigated the potential role of autophagy in stress-related IBD in patients and animal model. The correlation between psychosocial stress and intestinal autophagy was determined in 23 patients with IBD. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a well-established inducer of psychosocial stress, was administrated in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). In IBD patients, the autophagy markers beclin-1, LC3-II/I ratio, Atg16L1, and Atg4B were significantly enhanced. The psychosocial stress score was positively associated with the levels of beclin-1 and the LC3II/I ratio in intestinal biopsy specimens. In IBD mouse model, CRH significantly aggravated intestinal inflammation, increased Paneth cell metaplasia, and enhanced intestinal autophagy (beclin-1, Atg16L1, PIK3R4, and Atg4B upregulation; GAA, CTSD, and PPKAA1 downregulation). Additionally, the CRH-induced gut microbial  was evidenced by a marked increase in the number of detrimental bacteria. In LPS-stimulated BMDM, CRH substantially increased M1/M2 polarization and thus promoted inflammation. In both IBD mice and LPS-treated BMDM, blockade of autophagy by chloroquine abrogated the unbeneficial effects of CRH, whereas autophagy inducer rapamycin resulted in a pronounced protective effect against IBD lesion. Our data demonstrate that psychosocial stress may link the enhanced intestinal autophagy by modulating gut microbiota and inflammation to aggravate IBD.

We demonstrated that high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding causes intestinal metaplasia, which are precancerous lesions of the stomach, with augmented gastric leptin signaling. The aim of this study was to investigate the precise role of leptin signaling in the altered microbiota composition and pathogenesis in the stomach during diet-induced obesity.Male C57 BL/6 J, leptin receptor (Lepr)-mutated db/db, and gastrointestinal epithelium-specific Lepr conditional knockout (T3 b-Lepr cKO) mice were fed a HFD or control diet. Gastrointestinal microbiota was analyzed by 16 S rRNA gene sequences and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transplantation of gastric microbiota of HFD-fed mice was performed to evaluate metaplasia onset in recipient mice.One week of HFD caused severe microbial  in the stomach. The microbiota changes were accompanied by increased gastric leptin, leading to the consequent development of intestinal metaplasia. Transplantation of gastric microbiota from HFD-fed mice induced intestinal metaplasia in recipient mice; however, only a limited effect on pathogenesis was noted. HFD-fed db/db mice did not show a decrease in microbial abundance. Moreover, T3 b-Lepr cKO mice failed spontaneous obesity, and suppressed decreased abundance of gastric microbiota and occurrence of intestinal metaplasia during HFD feeding similar to db/db mice.Gastric leptin signaling modulates the gastric microbiota community and regulates the pathogenesis in the gastric mucosa.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Typhimurium in an In Vitro Rumen Simulation System.</a></h2><p>Glyphosate (-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is the most-used herbicide worldwide. Many studies in the past have shown that residues of the herbicide can be found in many cultivated plants, including those used as livestock feed. Sensitivity to glyphosate varies with bacteria, particularly those residing in the intestine, where microbiota is exposed to glyphosate residues. Therefore, less susceptible pathogenic isolates could have a distinct advantage compared to more sensitive commensal isolates, probably leading to . To determine whether the ruminal growth and survival of pathogenic  or  serovar Typhimurium are higher when glyphosate residues are present in the feed, an  fermentation trial with a "Rumen Simulation System" (RUSITEC) and a glyphosate-containing commercial formulation was performed. Colony forming units of  and  ser. Typhimurium decreased steadily in all fermenters, regardless of the herbicide application. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of the studied  and  strains did not change, and antibiotic susceptibility varied only slightly but independent of the glyphosate application. Overall, application of the glyphosate-containing formulation in a worst-case concentration of 10 mg/L neither increased the abundance for the tested  and  strain in the  fermentation system, nor promoted resistance to glyphosate or antibiotics.© 2019, The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560607>Horizontal and Vertical Transfer of Oral Microbial  and Periodontal Disease.</a></h2><p>One of the hallmark features of destructive periodontal disease, well documented over the last 50 y, is a change to the quantitative and qualitative composition of the associated microbiology. These alterations are now generally viewed as transformational shifts of the microbial populations associated with health leading to the emergence of bacterial species, which are only present in low abundance in health and a proportionate decrease in the abundance of others. The role of this  of the health associated microbiota in the development of disease remains controversial: is this altered microbiology the driving agent of disease or merely a consequence of the altered environmental conditions that invariably accompany destructive disease? In this work, we aimed to address this controversy through controlled transmission experiments in the mouse in which a dysbiotic oral microbiome was transferred either horizontally or vertically into healthy recipient mice. The results of these murine studies demonstrate conclusively that natural transfer of the dysbiotic oral microbiome from a periodontally diseased individual into a healthy individual will lead to establishment of the dysbiotic community in the recipient and concomitant transmission of the disease phenotype. The inherent resilience of the dysbiotic microbial community structure in diseased animals was further demonstrated by analysis of the effects of antibiotic therapy on periodontally diseased mice. Although antibiotic treatment led to a reversal of  of the oral microbiome, in terms of both microbial load and community structure,  of the microbiome was reestablished following cessation of therapy. Collectively, these data suggest that an oral dysbiotic microbial community structure is stable to transfer and can act in a similar manner to a conventional transmissible infectious disease agent with concomitant effects on pathology. These findings have implications to our understanding of the role of microbial  in the development and progression of human periodontal disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555657>Effects of Phytoestrogens on the Developing Brain, Gut Microbiota, and Risk for Neurobehavioral Disorders.</a></h2><p>Many pregnant and nursing women consume high amounts of soy and other plant products that contain phytoestrogens, such as genistein (GEN) and daidzein. Infants may also be provided soy based formulas. With their ability to bind and activate estrogen receptors (ESR) in the brain, such compounds can disrupt normal brain programming and lead to later neurobehavioral disruptions. However, other studies suggest that maternal consumption of soy and soy based formulas containing such phytoestrogens might lead to beneficial behavioral effects. Select gut microbes might also convert daidzein and to a lesser extent genistein to even more potent forms, e.g., equol derivatives. Thus, infant exposure to phytoestrogens may result in contrasting effects dependent upon the gut flora. It is also becoming apparent that consumption or exposure to these xenoestrogens may lead to gut . Phytoestrogen-induced changes in gut bacteria might in turn affect the brain through various mechanisms. This review will consider the evidence to date in rodent and other animal models and human epidemiological data as to whether developmental exposure to phytoestrogens, in particular genistein and daidzein, adversely or beneficially impact offspring neurobehavioral programming. Consideration will be given to potential mechanisms by which such compounds might affect neurobehavioral responses. A better understanding of effects perinatal exposure to phytoestrogen can exert on brain programming will permit pregnant women and those seeking to become pregnant to make better-educated choices. If phytoestrogen-induced gut  contributes to neurobehavioral disruptions, remediation strategies may be designed to prevent such gut microbiota alterations and thereby improve neurobehavioral outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650540>Patterns of placental antimicrobial resistance in preterm birth before 30 completed weeks gestation complicated by preterm prelabour rupture of membranes.</a></h2><p>While many guidelines recommend a 10-day course of oral erythromycin following preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) as derived from the ORACLE I trial, evidence is emerging that this may encourage a state of antenatal genital tract dysbiosis. In addition, erythromycin's lack of efficacy toward Gram-negative microorganisms may promote colonisation and infection, conveying more significant unrecognised risk for very and extremely preterm newborns.To define patterns of placental infection or colonisation in newborns born before 30 completed weeks gestation following PPROM.Retrospective cohort study of mother-infant dyads who delivered at < 30 completed weeks gestation following PPROM in a South Australian tertiary perinatal centre between January 2012 and December 2015. Main outcome measures included placental and neonatal culture and sensitivities within 72 h of delivery and histologic chorioamnionitis. Categorical characteristics were analysed using two-sided Fisher's exact test and numerical characteristics via analysis of variance.During the four years studied, 126 infant-mother dyads were identified. Where a placental swab was taken, 23.9% cultured Gram-negative organisms and the majority (58.8%) were antimicrobial-resistant. Those that received erythromycin had increased incidence of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative organisms on placental swab (P = 0.02). All cases of neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS), including two cases of multi-resistant Gram-negative EOS, occurred in those who received erythromycin.The current antibiotic recommendations for PPROM may promote selection of unhindered antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative organisms and may increase risk of Gram-negative EOS in very and extremely preterm newborns.

Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular tight-junctions (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut barrier on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-5, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO-2 are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut barrier function and are paralleled by an altered microbiota composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut barrier integrity and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly, microbiota "normalization" involving the transfer of WT microbiota into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut barrier causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed microbiota composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558417>Characteristics of intestinal bacteria with fatty liver diseases and cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) are significant health burdens worldwide with a substantial rise in prevalence.

Multiple factors could interfere with this delicate balance, including genetics, age, antibiotics, as well as environmental factors, particularly diet, thus causing a disruption of microbiota equilibrium (). Growing evidences support the involvement of GM  in gastrointestinal (GI) and extra-intestinal cardiometabolic diseases, namely obesity and diabetes. This review firstly overviews the role of GM in health and disease, then critically reviews the evidences regarding the influence of dietary polyphenols in GM based on preclinical and clinical data, ending with strategies under development to improve efficiency of delivery. Although the precise mechanisms deserve further clarification, preclinical and clinical data suggest that dietary polyphenols present prebiotic properties and exert antimicrobial activities against pathogenic GM, having benefits in distinct disorders. Specifically, dietary polyphenols have been shown ability to modulate GM composition and function, interfering with bacterial quorum sensing, membrane permeability, as well as sensitizing bacteria to xenobiotics. In addition, can impact on gut metabolism and immunity and exert anti-inflammatory properties. In order to overcome the low bioavailability, several different approaches have been developed, aiming to improve solubility and transport of dietary polyphenols throughout the GI tract and deliver in the targeted intestinal regions. Although more research is still needed, particularly translational and clinical studies, the biotechnological progresses achieved during the last years open up good perspectives to, in a near future, be able to improve the use of dietary polyphenols modulating GM in a broad range of disorders characterized by a dysbiotic phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572201>Xanthoceraside Could Ameliorate Alzheimer's Disease Symptoms of Rats by Affecting the Gut Microbiota Composition and Modulating the Endogenous Metabolite Levels.</a></h2><p>Xanthoceraside (XAN) is a natural-derived compound with anti-Alzheimer activity from the husks of . Although its therapeutic effect had been confirmed in previous studies, the mechanism was still unclear due to its poor solubility and low permeability. In this study, the pharmacological effect of XAN on Alzheimer's disease (AD) was confirmed by behavior experiments and H&E staining observation. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment also replicated the therapeutic effects, which indicates the potential targets of XAN on gut microbiota. The sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in fecal samples demonstrated that XAN reversed gut microbiota  in AD animals. XAN could change the relative abundances of several phyla and genus of bacterial, particularly the ratio of . Among them, , , , and  had been reported to be involved in the pathologic developments of AD and other central nervous system disease. In metabolomics study, a series of host endogenous metabolites were detected, including amino acids, lysophosphatidylcholine, dihydrosphingosine, phytosphingosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine, which were all closely associated with the development of AD. Combined with the Spearman's correlation analysis, it was confirmed that the increases of five bacterial strains and decreases of six bacterial strains were closely correlated with the increases of nine host metabolites and the decreases of another five host metabolites. Therefore, XAN can modulate the structure of gut microbiota in AD rats; the changes of gut microbiota were significantly correlated with endogenous metabolites, and symptom of AD was ultimately alleviated. Our findings suggest that XAN may be a potential therapeutic drug for AD, and the gut microbiota may be potential targeting territory of XAN  microbiome-gut-brain pathway.Copyright © 2019 Zhou, Tai, Xu, Lu and Meng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581570>Impact of Food Additives on Gut Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>In physiological conditions, the gut is heavily infiltrated with various subsets of inflammatory cells, whose activity is tightly controlled by counter-regulatory mechanisms. Defects in such mechanisms can favour the development of chronic intestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the principal forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in humans, as well as systemic disorders. Over the last years, the frequency of intestinal and systemic immune-inflammatory disorders has increased in previously low incidence areas, likely due to the Westernization of lifestyles, including dietary habits. The Western diet is characterized by high consumption of proteins, saturated fats and sweets, as well as by a broad use of food additives (e.g., emulsifiers, bulking agents), which are used to preserve and enhance food quality. Accumulating evidence suggests that food additives can perturb gut homeostasis, thereby contributing to promote tissue-damaging inflammatory responses. For instance, mice given the emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate 80 develop  with overgrowth of mucus-degrading bacteria. Such an effect triggers colitis in animals deficient in either interleukin-10, a cytokine exerting anti-inflammatory and regulatory functions, or Toll-like receptor 5, a receptor recognizing the bacterial flagellin. Similarly, the polysaccharide maltodextrin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress in intestinal goblet cells, thereby impairing mucus release and increasing host susceptibility to colitis. In this review, we report and discuss the current knowledge about the impact of food additives on gut homeostasis and their potential contribution to the development of inflammatory disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541581>Can Oral Health and Oral-derived Biospecimens Predict Progression of Dementia?</a></h2><p>Growing evidence indicates that oral health and brain health are interconnected.

Kefir is a fermented dairy product including yeast and bacterial species. We aimed to investigate the effect of kefir on trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats using two different doses. Fifty-four Wistar rats were divided into six groups. For 14 days, the normal control and colitis control groups were given tap water, kefir10 control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 control, and the kefir30 colitis groups were given phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% or 30% kefir, respectively, instead of tap water. Colitis was induced by intracolonically administrating TNBS in the colitis control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 colitis groups. On the 14th day, the rats were sacrificed. The weights and lengths of the colons were measured and macroscopically evaluated, and the distal 10 cm segments were subjected to a histopathological examination. The incidence of bloody stool and diarrhea in the kefir10 colitis group was found to be less than the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. The colonic weight/length ratio in the kefir10 colitis group was lower than that in the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. We detected that the 10% kefir treatment reduced TNBS-induced macroscopic colonic damage, while it was exacerbated by the 30% kefir treatment. No significant difference was observed between the colitis groups in terms of microscopic colonic damage scoring. These results indicate that kefir, with a careful dose selection, may be a useful agent in the treatment of IBD.© 2019 The Authors.

Patients with CKD also develop other comorbidities, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemias, liver and cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal problems, and cognitive deterioration, which worsens their health. Therapy includes reducing comorbidities or using replacement therapy, such as peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and organ transplant. Health care systems are searching for alternative treatments for CKD patients to mitigate or retard their progression. One new topic is the study of uremic toxins (UT), which are excessively produced during CKD as products of food metabolism or as a result of the loss of renal function that have a negative impact on the kidneys and other organs. High urea concentrations significantly modify the microbiota in the gut also, cause a decrease in bacterial strains that produce anti-inflammatory and fuel molecules and an increase in bacterial strains that can metabolize urea, but also produce UT, including indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate. UT activates several cellular processes that induce oxidative environments, inflammation, proliferation, fibrosis development, and apoptosis; these processes mainly occur in the gut, heart, and kidney. The study of the microbiota during CKD allowed for the implementation of therapy schemes to try to reduce the circulating concentrations of UT and reduce the damage.

Further understanding of the intestinal microbiome may help to establish alternative ways to treat, or even prevent, the disease.To explore alterations in fecal microbiota profiles in SoJIA patients and to evaluate the correlations between microbiota and clinical parameters.We conducted an observational single-center study at the Pediatric Department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Children who were diagnosed with SoJIA at our institution and followed for a minimum period of six months after diagnosis were recruited for the study. Healthy children were recruited as a control group (HS group) during the same period. Clinical data and stool samples were collected from SoJIA patients when they visited the hospital.The SoJIA group included 17 active and 15 inactive consecutively recruited children; the control group consisted of 32 children. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the two most abundant phyla among the total sample of SoJIA children and controls. There was a significant difference among the three groups in observed species, which was the highest in the Active-SoJIA group, followed by the Inactive-SoJIA group and then HS group (Active-SoJIA  HS:  = 0.000; and Inactive-SoJIA  HS:  = 0.005).

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

We hypothesize that different intestinal diseases, such as celiac disease (CD), adenomatous polyposis (AP) and colorectal cancer (CRC) could display a particular fecal SCFAs' signature.To compare the fecal SCFAs' profiles of CD, AP, CRC patients and healthy controls, using the same analytical method.In this cross-sectional study, we defined and compared the SCFAs' concentration in fecal samples of 9 AP, 16 CD, 19 CRC patients and 16 healthy controls (HC). The SCFAs' analysis were performed using a gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry method. Data analysis was carried out using Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess pairwise differences of SCFAs' profiles, partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) to determine the status membership based on distinct SCFAs' profiles, and Dirichlet regression to determine factors influencing concentration levels of SCFAs.We have not observed any difference in the SCFAs' amount and composition between CD and healthy control. On the contrary, the total amount of SCFAs was significantly lower in CRC patients compared to HC ( = 0.044) and CD ( = 0.005). Moreover, the SCFAs' percentage composition was different in CRC and AP compared to HC. In detail, HC displayed higher percentage of acetic acid ( value = 1.3 × 10) and a lower amount of butyric ( value = 0.02192), isobutyric ( value = 7.4 × 10), isovaleric ( value = 0.00012) and valeric ( value = 0.00014) acids compared to CRC patients. AP showed a lower abundance of acetic acid ( value = 0.00062) and higher percentages of propionic ( value = 0.00433) and isovaleric ( value = 0.00433) acids compared to HC. Moreover, AP showed higher levels of propionic acid ( value = 0.03251) and a lower level of isobutyric acid ( value = 0.00427) in comparison to CRC. The PLS-DA model demonstrated a significant separation of CRC and AP groups from HC, although some degree of overlap was observed between CRC and AP.Analysis of fecal SCFAs shows the potential to provide a non-invasive means of diagnosis to detect patients with CRC and AP, while CD patients cannot be discriminated from healthy subjects.©The Author(s) 2019.

Modification of gut microbiota and repression of BA synthesis are potential strategies for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and to understand the mechanisms of the probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), on hepatic bile acid synthesis, liver injury and fibrosis in bile-duct ligation (BDL) and Mdr2 mice. Global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors were used to dissect the role of FXR. LGG treatment significantly attenuated liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis with a significant reduction of hepatic BAs in BDL mice. Hepatic concentration of T-βMCA, an FXR antagonist, was markedly increased in BDL mice and reduced in LGG-treated mice, while chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an FXR agonist, was decreased in BDL mice and normalized in LGG-treated mice. LGG treatment significantly increased the expression of serum and ileum FGF15 and subsequently reduced hepatic CYP7A1 and BA synthesis in BDL and Mdr2 mice. At the molecular level, these changes were reversed by global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors in BDL mice. In addition, LGG treatment altered gut microbiota, which was associated with increased BA de-conjugation and increased fecal and urine BA excretion both in BDL and Mdr2 mice. In vitro studies showed that LGG suppressed the inhibitory effect of T-βMCA on FXR and FGF19 expression in Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: LGG supplementation decreases hepatic BA by increasing intestinal FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway-mediated suppression of BA de novo synthesis and enhances BA excretion, which prevents excessive BA-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we used the water avoidance stress (WAS) test in mouse models for chronic stress-induced gastritis to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this disease. The effect of stress on the gastric microbiota was analyzed based on 16S rRNA sequencing; the changes in hydrogen sulfide (H S) and inflammatory cytokine levels in gastric tissues were detected by Western blotting, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used as an indicator of the gastritis histological score. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that gastric H S is negatively associated with the inflammatory index and might protect the gastrointestinal tract from inflammation. WAS-induced gastritis was associated with a reduction in H S release, which appeared to affect the homeostasis of the gastric microbiota of mice. Inflammation and microbial  were partially reversed by sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and vitamin B6 (VB6) supplementation, suggesting the therapeutic potential of VB6 supplementation for the treatment of stress-induced gastritis. Gastritis has a serious impact on health and quality of life. An increasing number of people are suffering from chronic gastritis linked to a high-stress lifestyle, and our research provides clues for the prevention and treatment of stress-induced gastritis.© 2019 The Authors.

Many ENMs have historically been shown to possess antimicrobial properties, which has sparked concern for how dietary nanomaterials impact gastrointestinal health via microbial . We employed an in vitro Human Gut Simulator system to examine interactions of dietary nano titanium dioxide (TiO2) with human gut microbiota. Electron microscopy indicated a close association of TiO2 particles with bacterial cells. Addition of TiO2 to microbial communities led to a modest reduction in community density but had no impact on community diversity and evenness. In contrast, administration of known antimicrobial silver nanoparticles in a control experiment resulted in a drastic reduction of population density. In both cases, communities recovered once the addition of nanomaterials was ceased. Constrained ordination analysis of community profiles revealed that simulated colonic region was the primary determinant of microbiota composition. Accordingly, predicted community functional capacity and measured production of short chain fatty acids were not changed significantly upon microbiota exposure to TiO2. We conclude that tested TiO2 nanoparticles have limited direct effect on human gut microbiota.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Toxicology.

Although metagenomic analysis shows that the intestine of healthy humans and animals harbors various commensal viruses and the  of these viruses can be associated with inflammatory diseases, there is still a lack of causal data and underlying mechanisms to understand the physiological role of commensal viruses in intestinal homeostasis. In the present study, we show that commensal viruses are essential for the homeostasis of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Mechanistically, the cytosolic viral RNA-sensing receptor RIG-I in antigen-presenting cells can recognize commensal viruses and maintain IELs via a type I interferon-independent, but MAVS-IRF1-IL-15 axis-dependent, manner. The recovery of IELs by interleukin-15 administration reverses the susceptibility of commensal virus-depleted mice to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Collectively, our results indicate that commensal viruses maintain the IELs and consequently sustain intestinal homeostasis via noncanonical RIG-I signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659728>Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Disease in Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multiorgan disease, and gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations can contribute to significant morbidity and mortality for individuals with CF. Up to 85% of patients with CF experience GI symptoms, thus addressing the GI aspects of this disease is paramount. With the advent of highly effective CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators that are increasingly available, many individuals with CF now have significantly improved life expectancy. With these advances, GI manifestations that can be a detriment to quality of life such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, , and chronic abdominal pain have become a priority for patients and caregivers. In addition, as individuals have increased longevity, it has become essential for care providers to be aware of topics such as hepatobiliary disease and colorectal cancer screening. An understanding of the wide scope of GI manifestations in CF can enable providers to optimize the overall health and well-being of their patients.

The aim of this study is to elucidate the impacts of late-night eating on physiological function and gut microbiota.Male Wistar rats under 16 h/8 h-light/dark cycle were divided into four groups with specific dietary habits, which mimicked breakfast, lunch, dinner and late-night eating. Late-night eating, including skipping dinner for a night eating (BLN) and skipping breakfast and having a night eating (LDN), caused an increase of body weight, which is associated with decreased physical activity. Additionally, late-night eating resulted in hepatic lipid accumulation and systemic inflammation in peripheral tissues, compared to those of free feeding (FF) or breakfast, lunch and dinner (BLD) groups. The phases of key clock genes were similar in FF, BLD and BLN groups, while LDN feeding caused an overall 4-h phase delay in peripheral tissues. Moreover, late-night eating, especially LDN feeding, resulted in a significant alternation in the compositions and functions of gut microbiota, which further contributes to the development of metabolic disorder.Late-night eating caused physiological dysregulation and misalignment of circadian rhythm, together with microbial .

Gut microbiome diversity and its natural fermentation products are not only correlated with MS and CAD, but their correlations also appear to be stronger than the associations with traditional risk factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a new potential pathway for the natural fermentation product butyrate to improve MS and to examine whether it is associated with serum metabolic profiles and gut flora composition.  C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with 400 mg/kg of sodium butyrate for 16 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected, and the metabolite concentrations and 16s rRNA were measured with liquid chromatography-MS and Illumina platform, respectively. The plasma differential metabolites and gut microbiome composition were analyzed with XCMS online and QIIME 2, respectively.  Gut microbiome-derived butyrate reduced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, resisting HFD-induced increase in the relative abundance of f_, f_, and f_. Meanwhile, sodium butyrate increased the levels of α-linolenate, all-trans-retinal, resolvin E1, and leukotriene in the plasma, and the differential pathways showed enrichment in mainly resolvin E biosynthesis, histidine degradation, lipoxin biosynthesis, and leukotriene biosynthesis. Moreover, sodium butyrate increased the levels of phosphorylated-adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and facilitated glucose transporter member 4 (GLUT4) in the adipose tissue.  Butyrate can induce AMPK activation and GLUT4 expression in the adipose tissue, improving cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related metabolic disorder, resisting HFD-induced gut microbiome , and promoting resolvin E1 and lipoxin biosynthesis. Oral supplement of the natural fermentation product butyrate can be a potential strategy for preventing CVD.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Lv, Long, Chen, He, Ruan and Zhu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636714>Metagenomics: aid to combat antimicrobial resistance in diarrhea.</a></h2><p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as an obstacle in the supple administration of antimicrobial agents to critical diarrheal patients. Most diarrheal pathogens have developed resistance against the major classes of antibiotics commonly used for assuaging diarrheal symptoms. Antimicrobial resistance develops when pathogens acquire antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) through genetic recombination from commensals and pathogens. These are the constituents of the complex microbiota in all ecological niches. The recombination events may occur in the environment or in the gut. Containment of AMR can be achieved through a complete understanding of the complex and diverse structure and function of the microbiota. Its taxonomic entities serve as focal points for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genetic determinants. Molecular methods complemented with culture-based diagnostics have been historically implemented to document these natural events. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the field of molecular epidemiology. It has revolutionized the method of addressing relevant problems like diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases and the issue of antimicrobial resistance. Metagenomics is one such next-generation technique that has proved to be a monumental advancement in the area of molecular taxonomy. Current understanding of structure, function and  of microbiota associated with antimicrobial resistance was realized due to its conception. This review describes the major milestones achieved due to the advent and implementation of this new technique in the context of antimicrobial resistance. These achievements span a wide panorama from the discovery of novel microorganisms to invention of translational value.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555223>Association Between Impaired Vα7.2+CD161++CD8+ (MAIT) and Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ T-Cell Populations and Gut  in Chronically HIV- and/or HCV-Infected Patients.</a></h2><p>Both HIV and HCV infections feature increased microbial translocation (MT) and gut  that affect immune homeostasis and disease outcome. Given their commitment to antimicrobial mucosal immunity, we investigated mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and Vα7.2+CD161- T-cell frequency/function and their possible associations with MT and gut , in chronic HIV and/or HCV infections. We enrolled 56 virally infected (VI) patients (pts): 13 HIV+ on suppressive cART (HIV-RNA < 40cp/ml), 13 HCV+ naive to DAA (direct-acting antiviral) anti-HCV agents; 30 HCV+/HIV+ on suppressive cART and naive to anti-HCV. 13 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. For Vα7.2+CD161++ and Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ T cells we assessed: activation (CD69), exhaustion (PD1/CD39), and cytolytic activity (granzymeB/perforin). Following PMA/ionomycin and  stimulation we measured intracellular IL17/TNFα/IFNγ. Markers of microbial translocation (Plasma LPS, 16S rDNA, EndoCAb and I-FABP) were quantified. In 5 patients per group we assessed stool microbiota composition by 16S targeted metagenomics sequencing (alpha/beta diversity, relative abundance). Compared to controls, virally infected pts displayed significantly lower circulating Vα7.2+CD161++CD8+ MAIT cells ( = 0.001), yet expressed higher perforin ( = 0.004) and granzyme B ( = 0.002) on CD8+ MAIT cells. Upon  stimulation, the residual MAIT cells are less functional particularly those from HIV+/HCV+ patients. Conversely, in virally infected pts, Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ cells were comparable in frequency, highly activated/exhausted (CD69+:  = 0.002; PD-1+:  = 0.030) and with cytolytic potential (perforin+:  < 0.0001), yet were poorly responsive to  stimulation. A profound gut  characterized virally infected pts, especially HCV+/HIV+ co-infected patients, delineating a -poor/rich microbiota, with significant associations with MAIT cell frequency/function.

Therefore, nowadays one of the most urgent problems in modern medical science is the prevention and restoration of morphological and  disorders caused by numerous medications. With this background in mind, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of phytobacteria on toxic damage to the structure and function of the liver and ileum, as well as the composition of the large intestine microflora in white rats with intestinal dysbacteriosis due to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and ampicillin trihydrate. In order to prevent toxic damage to the liver and ileum of experimental animals, a phytobacterial agent was used. This test agent was composed of a mixture of commercial lactobacteria Lactobacillus helveticus with a water-soluble extract of thyme (Thymus Serpyllum L.) on a sterile milk basis. Our results showed that the introduction of phytobacterial agent led to reduced inflammation, accelerated regeneration of the ileum mucous membrane, and a positive effect on the damaged intestine. The phytobacterial agent increased the resistance of the body to potentially pathogenic microorganisms and toxic compounds by restoring the microflora of the large intestine. It was established that the phytobacterial remedy resulted in the normalization of the intestinal microflora of white rats, which had toxic damage to the liver and ileum caused by CCl4 and ampicillin trihydrate administration.

Fasted serum was collected from 49 participants (41 women) and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS to quantify 45 sphingolipids. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool was performed to profile the gut microbiome.Confirming the link to deteriorated glucose homeostasis, serum ceramides were positively correlated with fasting glucose, but inversely correlated with fasting and OGTT-derived measures of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. Significant associations with gut  were demonstrated, with SM and ceramides being inversely correlated with gene richness. Ceramides with fatty acid chain lengths of 20-24 carbons were the most associated with low richness. Diet-induced weight loss, which improved gene richness, decreased most sphingolipids. Thirty-one MGS, mostly corresponding to unidentified bacteria species, were inversely correlated with ceramides, including a number of Bifidobacterium and Methanobrevibacter smithii. Higher ceramide levels were also associated with increased metagenomic modules for lipopolysaccharide synthesis and flagellan synthesis, two pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and decreased enrichment of genes involved in methanogenesis and bile acid metabolism.This study identifies an association between gut microbiota richness, ceramides, and diabetes risk in overweight/obese humans, and suggests that the gut microbiota may contribute to dysregulation of lipid metabolism in metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587574>Concentration of Branched-Chain Amino Acids Is a Strong Risk Marker for Incident Hypertension.</a></h2><p>The potential role of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic diseases is increasingly recognized, but the association of BCAAs with incident hypertension remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the association of BCAAs with incident hypertension in a prospective population-based cohort study. We measured plasma concentrations of BCAAs by means of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 4169 participants from the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease) study. We estimated the risk of incident hypertension using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models. After a median follow-up of 8.6 years, incident hypertension was ascertained in 924 subjects. Cox regression analyses revealed a significant association between BCAAs and incident hypertension.

Likewise, the fully adjusted association remained significant when evaluated as categorical variable (hazard ratio for upper quartile with lowest quartile as reference category, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11-1.68; 0.003). Furthermore, the net reclassification improvement assessment improved after addition of BCAAs to a traditional risk model (<0.001).

In this study, we aimed at characterizing the gut microbiota composition in the three different stages of hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease patients and healthy individuals. Faecal samples and clinical data were collected from HBVCLD patients and healthy individuals. The 16S rDNA gene amplification products were sequenced. Bioinformatic analysis including alpha diversity and PICRUSt was performed. A total of 19 phyla, 43 classes, 72 orders, 126 families and 225 genera were detected. The beta-diversity showed a separate clustering of healthy controls and HBVCLD patients covering chronic hepatitis (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); and gut microbiota of healthy controls was more consistent, whereas those of CHB, LC and HCC varied substantially. The abundance of Firmicutes was lower, and Bacteroidetes was higher in patients with CHB, LC and HCC than in healthy controls. Predicted metagenomics of microbial communities showed an increase in glycan biosynthesis and metabolism-related genes and lipid metabolism-related genes in HBVCLD than in healthy individuals. Our study suggested that HBVCLD is associated with gut , with characteristics including, a gain in potential bacteria and a loss in potential beneficial bacteria or genes.

Rhinovirus (RV) infection did not have a significant effect on bacterial community composition. A significant difference in bacterial richness was observed between children with RV-A and RV-C infection, however this is likely due to the differences in age group between the patient cohorts. The bacterial community within the oropharynx was found to be diverse and heterogeneous. Age and attendance at day care or kindergarten were important factors in driving bacterial diversity.

Therefore we want to investigate whether the dCCA has a certain correlation with biliary microecology, and to detect specific strains.A total of 68 adults were enrolled, of whom 8 with dCCA, 16 with recurrent choledocholithiasis, and 44 with the onset of common bile duct stones. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancretography (ERCP) was utilized to collect bile samples for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, followed by analysis of bile microbiota composition.First, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria are the most dominant phyla in the bile of patients with dCCA and the onset of common bile duct stoes. Secondly, compared with the onset of common bile duct stones patients, we got a significant increase in the phylum Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, Latescibacteria, and Planctomycetes in dCCA patients. Finally, at the genus level, we obtained sequencing results of 252 bacterial genera from patients with dCCA, recurrent choledocholithiasis, and the new onset of common bile duct stones, revealing heterogeneity among individuals.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the  of bile flora in patients with dCCA.

Gut bacteria are known to produce energy substrates including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and acetate. The aim of this study was to determine whether ABA alters the proteome of gut microbiota relevant to ATP and acetate production.The ABA was developed in male mice and compared with food-restricted and ad libitum-fed conditions. Proteomic analysis of feces was performed using the two-dimentional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The in vitro ATP-producing capacity of proteins extracted from feces was assayed.Increased levels of the phosphoglycerate kinase, an ATP-producing glycolytic enzyme, was detected in feces of food-restricted mice and this enzyme was further increased in the ABA group. Starvation also upregulated several other proteins synthetized by order Clostridiales including Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae families. No significant differences in the in vitro ATP-producing capacity by bacterial proteins from ABA, food-restricted, and ad libitum-fed control mice were found. However, plasma levels of acetate strongly tended to be increased in the activity groups including ABA mice.The data revealed that starvation in food-restricted and ABA mice induced proteome modification in gut bacteria favoring ATP production mainly by the order Clostridiales. However, this did not result in increased total ATP-production capacity by gut microbiota. These changes can be interpreted as an adaptation of specific gut bacteria to the host malnutrition beneficial for host survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged 2 to 5 years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a 2-week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for 2 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and SCFA analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower SCFA concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal acetate and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both acetate and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS. Stunted children have impaired capacity to ferment certain types of RS which has implications for choice of RS in formulations aimed at improving microbial function in stunted children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623509>Subgingival Microbiota and Longitudinal Glucose Change: The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study (ORIGINS).</a></h2><p>Microbial communities along mucosal surfaces throughout the digestive tract are hypothesized as risk factors for impaired glucose regulation and the development of clinical cardiometabolic disease. We investigated whether baseline measures of subgingival microbiota predicted fasting plasma glucose (FPG) longitudinally. The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study (ORIGINS) enrolled 230 diabetes-free adults (77% female) aged 20 to 55 y (mean ± SD, 34 ± 10 y) from whom baseline subgingival plaque and longitudinal FPG were measured. DNA was extracted from subgingival plaque, and V3 to V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. FPG was measured at baseline and again at 2 y; glucose change was defined as follow-up minus baseline. Multivariable linear models regressed 2-y glucose change onto baseline measures of community diversity and abundances of 369 individual taxa. A microbial  index (MDI) summarizing top individual taxa associated with glucose change was calculated and used in regression models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, body mass index, and baseline glucose levels. Statistical significance was based on the false discovery rate (FDR; <0.05) or a Bonferroni-corrected  value of 1 × 10, derived from the initial 369 hypothesis tests for specific taxa. Mean 2-y FPG change was 1.5 ± 8 mg/dL. Baseline levels of 9 taxa predicted FPG change (all FDR <0.05), among which  sp oral taxon 097 and  spp predicted greater FPG change, while  sp oral taxon 498 predicted lesser FPG change (all 3  values, Bonferroni significant). The MDI explained 6% of variation in longitudinal glucose change ( < 0.001), and baseline glucose levels explained 10% of variation ( < 0.0001). FPG change values ± SE in the third versus first tertile of the MDI were 4.5 ± 0.9 versus 1.6 ± 0.9 ( < 1 × 10).

Gut  characteristic of end-stage liver disease may predispose patients to intestinal MDRB colonization and infection, in turn exacerbating . However, relationships between MDRB colonization and  after LT remain unclear. We prospectively recruited 177 adult patients undergoing LT at a single tertiary care center. 16 S V3-V4 rRNA sequencing was performed on 723 fecal samples collected pre-LT and periodically until one-year post-LT to test whether MDRB colonization was associated with decreased microbiome diversity. In multivariate linear mixed-effect models, MDRB colonization predicts reduced Shannon α-diversity, after controlling for underlying liver disease, antibiotic exposures, and clinical complications. Importantly, pre-LT microbial markers predict subsequent colonization by MDRB. Our results suggest MDRB colonization as a major, previously unrecognized, marker of persistent .

The functions of ion channels in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract influence a variety of cellular processes, many of which overlap with these hallmarks of cancer. In this review we focus on the roles of the calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl) and zinc (Zn) transporters in GI cancer, with a special emphasis on the roles of the KCNQ1 K channel and CFTR Cl channel in colorectal cancer (CRC). Ca is a ubiquitous second messenger, serving as a signaling molecule for a variety of cellular processes such as control of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration. Various members of the TRP superfamily, including TRPM8, TRPM7, TRPM6 and TRPM2, have been implicated in GI cancers, especially through overexpression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas and down-regulation in colon cancer. Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are classically associated with the initiation and conduction of action potentials in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells. The VGSC Na1.5 is abundantly expressed in human colorectal CRC cell lines as well as being highly expressed in primary CRC samples. Studies have demonstrated that conductance through Na1.5 contributes significantly to CRC cell invasiveness and cancer progression. Zn transporters of the ZIP/SLC39A and ZnT/SLC30A families are dysregulated in all major GI organ cancers, in particular, ZIP4 up-regulation in pancreatic cancer (PC). More than 70 K channel genes, clustered in four families, are found expressed in the GI tract, where they regulate a range of cellular processes, including gastrin secretion in the stomach and anion secretion and fluid balance in the intestinal tract. Several distinct types of K channels are found dysregulated in the GI tract. Notable are hERG1 upregulation in PC, gastric cancer (GC) and CRC, leading to enhanced cancer angiogenesis and invasion, and KCNQ1 down-regulation in CRC, where KCNQ1 expression is associated with enhanced disease-free survival in stage II, III, and IV disease. Cl channels are critical for a range of cellular and tissue processes in the GI tract, especially fluid balance in the colon. Most notable is CFTR, whose deficiency leads to mucus blockage, microbial  and inflammation in the intestinal tract. CFTR is a tumor suppressor in several GI cancers. Cystic fibrosis patients are at a significant risk for CRC and low levels of CFTR expression are associated with poor overall disease-free survival in sporadic CRC. Two other classes of chloride channels that are dysregulated in GI cancers are the chloride intracellular channels (CLIC1, 3 & 4) and the chloride channel accessory proteins (CLCA1,2,4). CLIC1 & 4 are upregulated in PC, GC, gallbladder cancer, and CRC, while the CLCA proteins have been reported to be down-regulated in CRC. In summary, it is clear, from the diverse influences of ion channels, that their aberrant expression and/or activity can contribute to malignant transformation and tumor progression. Further, because ion channels are often localized to the plasma membrane and subject to multiple layers of regulation, they represent promising clinical targets for therapeutic intervention including the repurposing of current drugs.©The Author(s) 2019.

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut  contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or 5 kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656958>Commentary: Loss of Function  Associated with Antibiotics and High Fat, High Sugar Diet.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561625>Characteristics of Gut Microbiota in Patients with Hypertension and/or Hyperlipidemia: A Cross-Sectional Study on Rural Residents in Xinxiang County, Henan Province.</a></h2><p>Human gut microbiota can be affected by a variety of factors, including geography. This study aimed to clarify the regional specific characteristics of gut microbiota in rural residents of Xinxiang county, Henan province, with hypertension and hyperlipidemia and evaluate the association of specific gut microbiota with hypertension and hyperlipidemia clinical indices. To identify the gut microbes, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used and a random forest disease classifier was constructed to discriminate between the gut microbiota in hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and the healthy control. Patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented with marked gut microbiota  compared to the healthy control. The gut microbiota related to hypertension and hyperlipidemia may consist of a large number of taxa, influencing each other in a complex metabolic network.

Hypercaloric diets are tightly related to the obesity etiology and also cause alterations in gut microbiota functionality. Diet and antibiotics are known to play crucial roles in changes in the microbiota ecosystem and the disruption of its balance; therefore, the manipulation of gut microbiota may represent an accurate strategy to understand its relationship with obesity caused by diet. Fecal microbiota transplantation, during which fecal microbiota from a healthy donor is transplanted to an obese subject, has aroused interest as an effective approach for the treatment of obesity. To determine its success, a multiomics approach was used that combined metagenomics and metaproteomics to study microbiota composition and function. To do this, a study was performed in rats that evaluated the effect of a hypercaloric diet on the gut microbiota, and this was combined with antibiotic treatment to deplete the microbiota before fecal microbiota transplantation to verify its effects on gut microbiota-host homeostasis. Our results showed that a high-fat diet induces changes in microbiota biodiversity and alters its function in the host. Moreover, we found that antibiotics depleted the microbiota enough to reduce its bacterial content. Finally, we assessed the use of fecal microbiota transplantation as a complementary obesity therapy, and we found that it reversed the effects of antibiotics and reestablished the microbiota balance, which restored normal functioning and alleviated microbiota disruption. This new approach could be implemented to support the dietary and healthy habits recommended as a first option to maintain the homeostasis of the microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665573>Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for  - Predictable Risks.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604984>Depletion of dietary aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands alters microbiota composition and function.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microbiota is critical for maintaining homeostasis. , an imbalance in the microbial community, contributes to the susceptibility of several diseases.

We assigned mice to a conventional diet, an AhR ligand-free diet, or an AhR ligand-free diet supplemented with the dietary AhR ligand indole-3-carbinol (I3C). We observed a global alteration of fecal microbiota upon dietary AhR ligand deprivation. Compared to mice on the conventional diet, family Erysipelotrichaceae was enriched in the feces of mice on the AhR ligand-free diet but returned to normal levels upon dietary supplementation with I3C. Faecalibaculum rodentium, an Erysipelotrichaceae species, depleted its growth media of AhR ligands. Cultured fecal bacteria from mice on the AhR ligand-free diet, but not the other two diets, were able to alter IgA levels in vitro, as was F. rodentium alone.

Herein, we aimed to evaluate the safety and potential benefit of rescue FMT for AAD in critically ill patients.A series of critically ill patients with AAD received rescue FMT from Chinese fmtBank, from September 2015 to February 2019. Adverse events (AEs) and rescue FMT success which focused on the improvement of abdominal symptoms and post-ICU survival rate during a minimum of 12 weeks follow-up were assessed.Twenty critically ill patients with AAD underwent rescue FMT, and 18 of them were included for analysis. The mean of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores at intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 21.7 ± 8.3 (range 11-37). Thirteen patients received FMT through nasojejunal tube, four through gastroscopy, and one through enema. Patients were treated with four (4.2 ± 2.1, range 2-9) types of antibiotics before and during the onset of AAD. 38.9% (7/18) of patients had FMT-related AEs during follow-up, including increased diarrhea frequency, abdominal pain, increased serum amylase, and fever. Eight deaths unrelated to FMT occurred during follow-up. One hundred percent (2/2) of abdominal pain, 86.7% (13/15) of diarrhea, 69.2% (9/13) of abdominal distention, and 50% (1/2) of hematochezia were improved after FMT. 44.4% (8/18) of patients recovered from abdominal symptoms without recurrence and survived for a minimum of 12 weeks after being discharged from ICU.In this case series studying the use of FMT in critically ill patients with AAD, good clinical outcomes without infectious complications were observed. These findings could potentially encourage researchers to set up new clinical trials that will provide more insight into the potential benefit and safety of the procedure in the ICU.ClinicalTrials.gov, Number  .
