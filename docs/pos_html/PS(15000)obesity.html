A 10-year follow-up study.</a></h1><p>In established acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with major complications (i.e. heart failure), overweight/obese patients usually have a survival advantage. To what extent this is irrespective of other characteristics remains inconclusive. The role of body mass index (BMI) in ACS prognosis (fatal/recurrent non-fatal cardiac episodes) and background potential interactions were evaluated.In 2006-2009, 1000 consecutive patients, hospitalized at First Cardiology Clinic of Athens with a diagnosis of ACS were enrolled in the study. All patients were classified according to heart failure phenotypes. One-month, 1-, 2- and 10-year follow-up examinations were performed (75% participation rate).Overweight was defined as 25≤BMI≤29.9kg/m2 and  as BMI >29.9kg/m2.BMI status and 10-year ACS prognosis followed a J-shape association (p=.009). Overweight patients had significantly better ACS prognosis than their normal-weight counterparts (OR=.45, 95% CI (.23, .90)). Significant interactions were observed between sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle parameters and BMI on 10-year ACS prognosis (all  for interaction≤10%); the aforementioned paradoxical association was retained only in patients who: were female (OR=.37, 95% CI (.16, .82)); were aged ≤65 years (OR=.25, 95% CI (.09, .69)), HFrEF (OR=.35, 95% CI (.13, .89)); were hypercholesterolemic (OR=.23, 95% CI (.07, .81)); had no hypertension (OR=.31, 95% CI (.12, .82)) or diabetes mellitus (OR=.29, 95% CI (.09, .95)); had moderate/high adherence to a Mediterranean diet (OR=.43, 95% CI (.22, .86)); and were physically active (OR=.37, 95% CI (., .88)).Although the overweight paradox was observed in the 10-year ACS prognosis of heart failure patients, this paradoxical association was not the case for all.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In utero tobacco smoke exposure produces somatic growth deficits like intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight in offspring, but it can also negatively influence neurodevelopmental outcomes in later stages of life, such as an increased incidence of  and drug abuse. Animal models demonstrate that prenatal nicotine (PN) alters the development of the mesocorticolimbic system, which is important for organizing goal-directed behavior. In the present study, we determined whether intravenous (IV) PN altered the initiation and/or expression of methamphetamine (METH)-induced locomotor sensitization as a measure of mesocorticolimbic function in adult rat offspring. We also determined whether PN and/or METH exposure altered protein levels of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the nucleus accumbens, the dorsal striatum, and the prefrontal cortex of adult offspring. BDNF was of interest because of its role in the development and maintenance of the mesocorticolimbic pathway and its ability to modulate neural processes that contribute to drug abuse, such as sensitization of the dopamine system. Dams were injected with IV nicotine (.05 mg/kg/injection) or saline, 3×/day on gestational days 8-21. Testing was conducted when offspring reached adulthood (around postnatal day 90). Following 3 once daily habituation sessions the animals received a saline injection and baseline locomotor activity was measured. PN and prenatal saline ()-exposed offspring then received 10 once daily injections of METH (.3 mg/kg) to induce locomotor sensitization. The animals received a METH injection (.3 mg/kg) to assess the expression of sensitization following a 14-day period of no injections. A day later, all animals were injected with saline and conditioned hyperactivity was assessed. Brain tissue was harvested 24 h later. PN animals habituated more slowly to the activity chambers compared to  controls. PN rats treated with METH showed significant enhancement of locomotor behavior compared to  rats following acute and repeated injections; however, PN did not produce differential initiation or expression of behavioral sensitization. METH produced conditioned hyperactivity, and PN rats exhibited a greater conditioned response of hyperactivity relative to controls. PN and METH exposure produced changes in BDNF protein levels in all three regions, and complex interactions were observed between these two factors. Logistic regression revealed that BDNF protein levels, throughout the mesocorticolimbic system, significantly predicted the difference in the conditioned hyperactive response of the animals: both correlations were significant, but the predicted relationship between BDNF and context-elicited activity was stronger in the PN (r = .67) compared to the  rats (r = .42). These findings indicate that low-dose PN exposure produces long-term changes in activity and enhanced sensitivity to the locomotor effects of METH. The enhanced METH-induced contextual conditioning shown by the PN animals suggests that offspring of in utero tobacco smoke exposure have greater susceptibility to learn about drug-related conditional stimuli, such as the context. The PN-induced alterations in mesocorticolimbic BDNF protein lend further support for the hypothesis that maternal smoking during pregnancy produces alterations in neuronal plasticity that contribute to drug abuse vulnerability. The current findings demonstrate that these changes are persistent into adulthood.© 2016 S.

We examined the association of 11 risk factors with adverse outcomes in a population-based prospective cohort observational study of Alaska Native/American Indian persons with chronic HCV infection.We collected data from a population-based cohort study of liver-related adverse outcomes of infection in American Indian/Alaska Native persons with chronic HCV living in Alaska, recruited from 1995 through 2012. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for end-stage liver disease (ESLD; presence of ascites, esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, or coagulopathy), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver-related death using a Cox proportional hazards model.We enrolled 1080 participants followed up for 11,171 person-years (mean, 10.3 person-years); 66%, 19%, and 14% were infected with HCV genotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. On multivariate analysis, persons infected with HCV genotype 3 had a significantly increased risk of developing all 3 adverse outcomes. Their aHR for ESLD was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.5-3.), their aHR for HCC was 3.1 (95% CI, 1.4-6.6), and their aHR for liver-related death was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.5-4.) compared with genotype 1. Heavy alcohol use was an age-adjusted risk factor for ESLD (aHR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.2), and liver-related death (aHR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.8-4.6).  was a risk factor for ESLD (aHR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.-1.9), and diabetes was a risk factor for ESLD (aHR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2). Male sex was a risk factor for HCC (aHR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.6-8.2).In a population-based cohort study of American Indian/Alaska Native persons with chronic HCV infection, we found those infected with HCV genotype 3 to be at high risk for ESLD, HCC, and liver-related death.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies was undertaken to summarize the association between abdominal  and the risk of hip fracture. We searched online databases for relevant publications up to February 2017, using relevant keywords. In total, 14 studies were included in the systematic review and 9 studies, with a total sample size of 295,674 individuals (129,964 men and 165,703 women), were included in the meta-analysis. Participants were apparently healthy and aged ≥40 y. We found that abdominal  (defined by various waist-hip ratios) was positively associated with the risk of hip fracture (combined RR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.46,  = .01). Combining 8 effect sizes from 6 studies, we noted a marginally significant positive association between abdominal  (defined by various waist circumferences) and the risk of hip fracture (combined RR: 1.36; 95% CI: .97, 1.89,  = .07). This association became significant in a fixed-effects model (combined effect size: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.58,  < .001). Based on 5 effect sizes, we found that a .1-U increase in the waist-hip ratio was associated with a 16% increase in the risk of hip fracture (combined RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.29,  = .007), whereas a 10-cm increase in waist circumference was not significantly associated with a higher risk of hip fracture (combined RR: 1.13, 95% CI: .94, 1.36,  = .19). This association became significant, however, when we applied a fixed-effects model (combined effect size: 1.21, 95% CI: 1., 1.27,  < .001). We found that abdominal  was associated with a higher risk of hip fracture in 295,674 individuals. Further studies are needed to test whether there are associations between abdominal  and fractures at other bone sites.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28038437>Internalization of appearance ideals mediates the relationship between appearance-related pressures from peers and emotional eating among adolescent boys and girls.</a></h1><p>Appearance-related pressures have been associated with binge eating in previous studies. Yet, it is unclear if these pressures are associated with emotional eating or if specific sources of pressure are differentially associated with emotional eating. We studied the associations between multiple sources of appearance-related pressures, including pressure to be thin and pressure to increase muscularity, and emotional eating in 300 adolescents (M=.3, SD=1.4, 60% female). Controlling for age, race, puberty, body mass index (BMI) z-score, and sex, both pressure to be thin and pressure to be more muscular from same-sex peers were positively associated with emotional eating in response to feeling angry/frustrated and unsettled (<.05). Pressure from same-sex peers to be more muscular also was associated with eating when depressed (p<.05), and muscularity pressure from opposite-sex peers related to eating in response to anger/frustration (p<.05). All associations were fully mediated by internalization of appearance ideals according to Western cultural standards (<.001). Associations of pressures from mothers and fathers with emotional eating were non-significant. Results considering sex as a moderator of the associations between appearance-related pressures and emotional eating were non-significant. Findings illustrate that both pressure to be thin and muscular from peers are related to more frequent emotional eating among both boys and girls, and these associations are explained through internalization of appearance-related ideals.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the role of PAX6 in pineal development and circadian regulation, adolescents with PAX6+/- may experience sleep-wake disturbances. The purpose of this observational study was to explore sleep-related phenotypes in adolescents with PAX6+/-.This study compared sleep phenotypes of nine subjects with PAX6+/- (aged 10-19 years) with previously published data on healthy adolescents ( n = 25, aged 10-18 years). Subjects completed the Cleveland Adolescent Sleepiness Questionnaire (CASQ), Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance (v. 1.; 8a), and PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment (v. 1.; 8b) Questionnaires and wore actigraphs for seven nights to record sleep patterns.Total CASQ, PROMIS sleep-related impairment, and PROMIS sleep disturbance scores were not statistically different between the groups (  > .). Actigraph data for lights off to sleep-onset time were found to be significantly higher in subjects with PAX6+/- versus the healthy comparison group (adjusted mean [95% confidence interval]: 20.1 min [8.1, 49.8] vs. 6.2 min [3.7, 10.4], respectively, p = .04).Both adolescents with PAX6+/- and the healthy comparison group on average slept less than 8 hr/night, and overall sleep deprivation in adolescents may have masked differences between groups. This study used rare genetic disorders with biological vulnerability to sleep problems as a genotype-phenotype model.

Adjusting for covariates and repeated measures of BMI or fat mass, linear mixed models revealed that weight-based teasing was associated with greater gain of BMI and fat mass across the follow-up period ( ≤ .007). Adjusting for covariates, youths reporting high weight-based teasing (two standard deviations above the mean) experienced a 33% greater gain in BMI (an additional .20 kg/m ) and a 91% greater gain in fat mass (an additional .65 kg) per year compared with peers who reported no weight-based teasing.Among youths with, and at-risk for, overweight and , weight-based teasing was associated with greater weight and fat gain.© 2019 World  Federation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396820>Consistent self-monitoring in a commercial app-based intervention for weight loss: results from a randomized trial.</a></h1><p>Self-monitoring is the strongest predictor of success in lifestyle interventions for . In this secondary analysis of the GoalTracker trial, we describe outcomes of consistently self-monitoring in a standalone weight loss intervention. The 12-week intervention focused on daily self-monitoring of diet and/or body weight in a commercial app (MyFitnessPal). Participants (N = 100; 21-65 years; BMI 25-45 kg/m) were categorized as Consistent Trackers if they tracked ≥ 6 out of 7 days for at least 75% of the targeted weeks. One-fourth of participants were Consistent Trackers. This subset was more likely to be married or living with a partner, be non-Hispanic White, and have higher health literacy than Inconsistent Trackers ( < .05). Consistent tracking was associated with greater weight change than inconsistent tracking at 1 month (mean difference [95% CI] - 1.11 kg [- 2.12, - .10]), 3 months (- 2.42 kg [- 3.80, - 1.04]), and 6 months (- 2.13 kg [- 3.99, - .27]). Over 3 times as many Consistent Trackers as Inconsistent Trackers achieved ≥ 5% weight loss at 3 months (48 vs. 13%) and at 6 months (54 vs. %;  < .001). Though causality cannot be determined by the present study, tracking weight and/or diet nearly every day per week for 12 weeks in a commercial app may serve as an effective strategy for weight loss.

The present study examined cross-cultural differences in male and female participants' ability to visually identify the weight status of photographed Caucasian males.Five hundred and fifty three male and female young adults from the US (high  prevalence), UK and Sweden (lower  prevalence) participated in an online study. Participants judged the weight status of a series of photographed healthy weight, overweight and obese (class I) Caucasian males and rated the extent to which they believed each male should consider losing weight.There was a strong tendency for both male and female participants to underestimate the weight status of the photographed overweight and obese males. Photographed males were frequently perceived as being of healthier weight than they actually were. Some modest cross-cultural differences were also observed; US participants were worse at recognising  than UK participants (p < .05) and were also significantly more likely to believe that the photographed obese males did not need to consider losing weight, in comparison to both the UK and Swedish participants ( < .05). No cross-cultural differences were observed for perceptions or attitudes towards the photographed healthy weight or overweight males.The weight status of overweight and obese (class I) Caucasian males is underestimated when judged by males and females using visual information alone. This study provides initial evidence of modest cross-cultural differences in attitudes toward, and the ability to recognise,  in Caucasian males.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29237801>Adolescent Loss-of-Control Eating and Weight Loss Maintenance After Bariatric Surgery.</a></h1><p>Loss-of-control (LOC) eating is common in adults undergoing bariatric surgery and is associated with poorer weight outcomes. Its long-term course in adolescent bariatric surgery patients and associations with weight outcomes are unclear.Adolescents ( = 234; age range = 13-19 years) undergoing bariatric surgery across 5 US sites were assessed for postsurgery follow-up at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, and 4 years. Descriptive statistics and generalized linear mixed models were used to describe the prevalence of LOC eating episodes involving objectively large amounts of food and continuous eating, respectively. Generalized linear mixed models investigated the association of any LOC eating with short- and long-term BMI changes.At baseline, objectively large LOC eating was reported by .4% of adolescents, and continuous LOC eating by 27.8% of adolescents. Both forms of LOC eating were significantly lower at all postsurgical time points relative to presurgery (range = .5%-14.5%; s < .05). However, both behaviors gradually increased from 6-month to 4-year follow-up (s < .05). Presurgical LOC eating was not related to percent BMI change over follow-up ( = .79). However, LOC eating at 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up was associated with lower percent BMI change from baseline at the next consecutive assessment (s < .05).Although presurgical LOC eating was not related to relative weight loss after surgery, postoperative LOC eating may adversely affect long-term weight outcomes. Rates of LOC eating decreased from presurgery to 6-months postsurgery but increased thereafter. Therefore, this behavior may warrant additional empirical and clinical attention.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26202568>Computing a Synthetic Chronic Psychosocial Stress Measurement in Multiple Datasets and its Application in the Replication of G × E Interactions of the EBF1 Gene.</a></h1><p>Chronic psychosocial stress adversely affects health and is associated with the development of disease [Williams, 2008]. Systematic epidemiological and genetic studies are needed to uncover genetic variants that interact with stress to modify metabolic responses across the life cycle that are the proximal contributors to the development of cardiovascular disease and precipitation of acute clinical events. Among the central challenges in the field are to perform and replicate gene-by-environment (G × E) studies. The challenge of measurement of individual experience of psychosocial stress is magnified in this context. Although many research datasets exist that contain genotyping and disease-related data, measures of psychosocial stress are often either absent or vary substantially across studies. In this paper, we provide an algorithm to create a synthetic measure of chronic psychosocial stress across multiple datasets, applying a consistent criterion that uses proxy indicators of stress components. We validated the computed scores of chronic psychosocial stress by observing moderately strong and significant correlations with the self-rated chronic psychosocial stress in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Cohort (Rho = .23, P < .0001) and with the measures of depressive symptoms in five datasets (Rho = .-.42,  = .005 to <.0001) and by comparing the distributions of the self-rated and computed measures. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this computed chronic psychosocial stress variable by providing three additional replications of our previous finding of gene-by-stress interaction with central  traits [Singh et al., 2015].© 2015 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470804>Dietary prescription adherence and non-structured physical activity following weight loss with and without aerobic exercise.</a></h1><p>To compare the effects of weight loss with and without exercise on 1) dietary prescription adherence and 2) non-structured activity in postmenopausal women.Longitudinal study.Clinical research setting with facility based exercise and nutrition education.Overweight and obese women, 45-76 years old.6 months of weight loss alone (WL; N=38) or with aerobic exercise (AEX+WL; N=41).Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), resting metabolic rate (RMR), seven day food intake, and physical activity (by Actical accelerometers worn in a subset subgroup: WL: N=10; AEX+WL: N=) were assessed before and after the interventions.Both interventions resulted in similar weight loss (~9%) and no significant changes in RMR, while only the AEX+WL group improved VO2max (~10%). At baseline, the AEX+WL group consumed slightly more protein than the WL group (P<.01). Macronutrient intake did not change following AEX+WL, but the WL group decreased their fat intake and increased their carbohydrates and protein intakes (<.05), which resulted in similar macronutrient intakes between groups post-intervention. Weekday total activity counts decreased 22% (P<.05) following WL. This change tended (P=.07) to be different than the lack of change in non-structured activity observed following AEX+WL.Although similar dietary adherence was observed, these data suggest that postmenopausal women undergoing weight loss may benefit from the addition of exercise to prevent the decline in non-structured activity observed following weight loss alone.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26609807>Characterisation of adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles released pre- and post-adipogenesis.</a></h1><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are submicron vesicles released from many cell types, including adipocytes. EVs are implicated in the pathogenesis of -driven cardiovascular disease, although the characteristics of adipocyte-derived EVs are not well described. We sought to define the characteristics of adipocyte-derived EVs before and after adipogenesis, hypothesising that adipogenesis would affect EV structure, molecular composition and function. Using 3T3-L1 cells, EVs were harvested at day  and day  of differentiation. EV and cell preparations were visualised by electron microscopy and EVs quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). EVs were then assessed for annexin V positivity using flow cytometry; lipid and phospholipid composition using 2D thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography; and vesicular protein content by an immuno-phenotyping assay. Pre-adipogenic cells are connected via a network of protrusions and EVs at both time points display classic EV morphology. EV concentration is elevated prior to adipogenesis, particularly in exosomes and small microvesicles. Parent cells contain higher proportions of phosphatidylserine () and show higher annexin V binding. Both cells and EVs contain an increased proportion of arachidonic acid at day . PREF-1 was increased at day  whilst adiponectin was higher at day  indicating EV protein content reflects the stage of adipogenesis of the cell. Our data suggest that EV production is higher in cells before adipogenesis, particularly in vesicles <300 nm. Cells at this time point possess a greater proportion of  (required for EV generation) whilst corresponding EVs are enriched in signalling fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, and markers of adipogenesis, such as PREF-1 and PPARγ.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29086487>Characteristics of Weight Loss Trajectories in a Comprehensive Lifestyle Intervention.</a></h1><p>Focusing on average weight loss (WL) from interventions provides useful efficacy data but masks large variability across patients. In this study, parameters of weight loss trajectories were determined that differentiated individuals during a -week clinical lifestyle intervention.Patients (n = 595) were in a fee-for-service WL lifestyle program with a partial meal replacement diet and lifestyle change counseling. Parameters used in latent class analyses were percent WL (%WL), weight nadir, number of weekly weight gains, maximum weekly percent weight gain, standard deviation of weekly weight changes, linear slope values, and change in slope.Average %WL was 9.73%. Latent class analyses revealed three groups with considerable overlap in %WL ranges but differing significantly on all trajectory parameters ( < .001). Group 1 had the most variable and least successful pattern of weight changes. Group 3 had the least variable and most successful pattern of weight changes. Group 2 fell between the others on all parameters.Emphasis on average WL likely obscures considerable variability in individual courses of weight change. Moreover, patients with similar %WL can have different WL trajectories. Identification of behavioral/physiological characteristics associated with different weight loss trajectories may facilitate the development of more tailored interventions, particularly for trajectories associated with less optimal outcomes.© 2017 The  Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30139293>Effect of Using a Sit-Stand Desk on Ratings of Discomfort, Fatigue, and Sleepiness Across a Simulated Workday in Overweight and Obese Adults.</a></h1><p>Limited research examines the influence of sit-stand desks on ratings of discomfort, sleepiness, and fatigue.

Sleepiness was assessed hourly. Discomfort, physical fatigue, and mental fatigue were measured every other hour. Linear mixed models evaluated whether these measures differed across conditions and the workday. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d.Participants were primarily white (84%) males (64%), with mean (SD) body mass index of 31.9 (5.) kg/m and age 42 (12) years. SIT-STAND resulted in decreased odds of discomfort (OR = .37, P = .01) and lower overall discomfort (β = -.19, P < .001, d = .42) versus SIT. Discomfort during SIT-STAND was lower in the lower and upper back, but higher in the legs (all < .01, d = .26-.42). Sleepiness (β = -.09, P = .01, d = .) and physical fatigue (β = -.34, P = .002, d = .34) were significantly lower in SIT-STAND. Mental fatigue was similar across conditions.Sit-stand desks may reduce acute levels of sleepiness, physical fatigue, and both overall and back discomfort.

Multivariate regression analyses revealed a significant independent association of serum insulin levels with QTc, QTc and QTc values (all  < .05) preoperatively, whilst changes in QTc interval length after the surgery were not consistently associated to concurrent changes in metabolic traits.Our data show that the extent of weight loss-associated QTc interval shortening largely depends on the applied HR correction equation and appears to be overestimated when the most popular Bazett's equation is used.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730658>The impact of weight classification on safety: timing steps to adapt to external constraints.</a></h1><p>The purpose of the current study was to evaluate how weight classification influences safety by examining adults' ability to meet a timing constraint: walking to the pace of an audio metronome.With a cross-sectional design, walking parameters were collected as 55 adults with normal (n=30) and overweight (n=25) body mass index scores walked to slow, normal, and fast audio metronome paces.Between group comparisons showed that at the fast pace, those with overweight body mass index (BMI) had longer double limb support and stance times and slower cadences than the normal weight group (all <.05). Examinations of participants' ability to meet the metronome paces revealed that participants who were overweight had higher cadences at the slow and fast paces (all <.05).Findings suggest that those with overweight BMI alter their gait to maintain biomechanical stability.

Eighty participants were randomized to receive standard self-monitoring tools (ST, n = 26), technology-based self-monitoring tools (TECH, n = 27), or technology-based tools combined with phone-based intervention (TECH + PHONE, n = 27). All participants attended one introductory weight loss session and completed assessments at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.Weight loss from baseline to 6 months differed significantly between groups P = .042; there was a trend for TECH + PHONE (-6.4 ± 1.2 kg) to lose more weight than ST (-1.3 ± 1.2 kg); weight loss in TECH (-4.1 ± 1.4 kg) was between ST and TECH + PHONE. Fewer ST (%) achieved ≥5% weight losses compared with TECH and TECH + PHONE (44%), P = .039. Adherence to self-monitoring caloric intake was higher in TECH + PHONE than TECH or ST,  < .05.These results suggest use of newer self-monitoring technology plus brief phone-based intervention improves adherence and weight loss compared with traditional self-monitoring tools. Further research should determine cost-effectiveness of adding phone-based intervention when providing self-monitoring technology.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2016 The  Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25772036>Sarcopaenia is associated with NAFLD independently of  and insulin resistance: Nationwide surveys (KNHANES 2008-2011).</a></h1><p>Although sarcopaenia is associated with -related comorbidities, its influence on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or steatohepatitis has not been fully determined. We aimed to investigate the direct relationship between sarcopaenia and NAFLD or steatohepatitis in the general population.We conducted a cross-sectional study using nationally representative samples of ,132 subjects from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2008-2011. Subjects were defined as having NAFLD when they had higher scores from previously validated NAFLD prediction models such as the hepatic steatosis index, comprehensive NAFLD score and NAFLD liver fat score. BARD and FIB-4 scores were used to define advanced fibrosis in subjects with NAFLD. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) [SMI(%)=total appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg)/weight (kg)×100] measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to diagnose sarcopaenia with cut points of 32.2% for men and 25.5% for women.SMI was inversely correlated with all NAFLD predicting scores (<.001). After stratification, sarcopaenic subjects had an increased risk of NAFLD regardless of  (odds ratios [ORs]=1.55 to 3.02, depending on models; all <.001) or metabolic syndrome (ORs=1.63 to 4.00, all <.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis also demonstrated this independent association between sarcopaenia and NAFLD after adjusting for confounding factors related to  or insulin resistance (ORs=1.18 to 1.22, all <.001). Furthermore, among the NAFLD population, subjects with lower SMIs were likely to have advanced fibrosis compared with non-sarcopaenic individuals (BARD and FIB-4: ORs=1.83 and 1.69, respectively; both <.001). Compared with non-exercised subjects, individuals who exercised regularly had a lower risk of NAFLD (p<.001), particularly among obese people with well-preserved muscle mass.Sarcopaenia is associated with increased risks of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, independent of  or metabolic control.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

While obese women are at greater risk for infection than non-obese women, evidence-based recommendations for modifying dosing in these women are limited.The purpose of this study was to determine whether obese women undergoing cesarean delivery similarly reach adequate cefazolin concentrations within tissue and blood when weighing <120kg and dosed 2g versus weighing ≥120kg and dosed 3g.We prospectively studied women ≥18 years old with body mass index ≥30kg/m who underwent scheduled cesarean delivery with singleton pregnancy from August 2014 through March 2016. Women were dosed with 2g and 3g of cefazolin for body weights <120kg and ≥120kg, respectively. Samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue (following skin incision and before skin closure), myometrial tissue, fetal cord blood, and maternal blood were collected to assess whether cefazolin concentrations were adequate, i.e., at/above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Concentrations, based on inhibition zones for Streptococcus sanguinis, were calculated per gram of solid tissue and milliliter of blood. For all sample types, log-transformed concentrations were compared between dosage groups. Using a range of published MICs (1-8μg/mL or μg/g), odds ratios, describing differential odds of falling below the MIC between dosage groups, were also computed.Women who received 2g (n=65) versus 3g (n=19) of cefazolin did not significantly differ by maternal or gestational age, race/ethnicity, pre-operative hemoglobin, estimated blood loss, fluid administration, duration of surgery, or timing of sample collections relative to cefazolin administration (>.05). Dosage groups also did not differ in cefazolin concentration (median [interquartile range]) within adipose tissue following skin incision (5.30μg/g [3.00-9.60] vs. 6.35μg/g [3.90-8.40]; P=.551), adipose tissue before skin closure (4.45μg/g [2.78-7.25] vs. 6.90μg/g [2.60-10.6]; P=.342), myometrial tissue (13.1μg/g [8.60-19.6] vs. .7μg/g [10.8-21.7]; P=.116), or maternal blood (41.6μg/mL [26.3-57.] vs. 45.3μg/mL [36.7-68.3]; P=.143). However, cord blood concentrations differed significantly (19.5μg/mL [13.7-28.5] vs. 27.9μg/mL [.8-39.4]; P=.032), and, in 3 of 5 sample types, group concentrations differed at the dosing cut-point of 120kg (<.02). Within the range of MICs considered, differences in the odds of concentration inadequacy were not detected between dosage groups for any sample type. Across all patients, inadequate concentrations in one or more solid tissue types were observed in 1.19%, 17.9%, 59.5%, and 86.9% of patients, given the MICs of 1μg/g, 2μg/g, 4μg/g and 8μg/g, respectively. In adipose tissues, specifically, and both dosage groups, mean concentrations were significantly lower than the MIC of 8μg/g (<.03). Concentrations in one or both blood sample types were inadequate for only 8.33% of patients, given the 8-μg/mL MIC.Adequate cefazolin concentrations were achieved in blood for the majority of our patients. However, concentration adequacy was not achieved in solid tissue for a nearly equally large proportion of patients. Larger scale studies for determining modified protocols for dosing and applying MICs are warranted.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The composition of placental glycerophospholipids (GPL) is known to be altered in GDM and might reflect an aberrant fatty acid transfer across the placenta and thus affect the foetal body composition. The aim of this study was to investigate possible effects of  and GDM, respectively, on placental GPL species composition. We investigated molecular species of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine () in term placentas from controls (lean non-diabetic, body-mass-index [BMI] 18-24.9k g/m(2), n=31), obese non-diabetics (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2), n=17) and lean diabetics (n=), using liquid chromatography - triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. PE(16:/22:6) and PE(18:/20:4) were increased in GDM and decreased species were PC(18:/20:3), PC(18:1/20:3) and (18:/18:2). A consistent difference between BMI related changes and changes caused by GDM was not observed. Arachidonic acid percentages of cord blood correlated with placental PC(16:/20:4), whereas foetal docosahexaenoic acid correlated to placental PE species. Furthermore, a positive correlation of placental weight was found to levels of PE containing arachidonic acid. We demonstrated that  and GDM are associated with decreased dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and increased arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid contents of placental GPL, with unknown consequences for the foetus. PC(16:/20:4) was identified as the major component for the supply of arachidonic acid to the foetal circulation, whereas PE containing arachidonic acid was found to be associated to the placental and infant growth.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2015.

We examined baseline serum insulin and homeostasis model of assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) as predictors of follow-up BMI Z-score and fat mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in mixed model longitudinal analyses accounting for baseline body composition, pubertal stage, sociodemographic factors and follow-up interval.At baseline, 39% were obese (BMI⩾95th percentile for age/sex). Data from 1335 annual visits were examined. Children were followed for an average of 7.2±4.3 years, with a maximum follow-up of  years. After accounting for covariates, neither baseline insulin nor HOMA-IR was significantly associated with follow-up BMI (>.26), BMIz score (>.22), fat mass (>.78) or fat mass percentage (>.71). In all models, baseline BMI (P<.0001), body fat mass (P<.0001) and percentage of fat (P<.001) were strong positive predictors for change in BMI and fat mass. In models restricted to children without  at baseline, some but not all models had significant interaction terms between body adiposity and insulinemia/HOMA-IR that suggested less gain in mass among those with greater insulin or IR.

Sleep deprivation is linked to physical problems such as  but also to change in performance at school and mood disorders. Changes have been associated with the use of screens, cell phones, Internet and social media. Use of screens has been shown to delay sleep onset and melatonin secretion and stimulation of wake systems by interaction with social media may exacerbate these effects. The links between the use of social media and sleep patterns have not been fully explored. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of social media on teenagers' sleep and the impact of sleep deprivation.As part of a sleep education program conducted in middle schools, teenagers from 6th to 9th grade were invited to complete an online questionnaire on sleep habits with teacher supervision and after parental consent. Outcome measures were sleep and wake times with estimated sleep duration in school (SP) and rest periods (RP), use of screens (computers, tablets, smartphones and video game consoles), the use of social media and impact on visual analogue scales of sleep quality, mood and daytime functioning. Students were divided into those with clear sleep deprivation (sleep time<6hours in SP) and those whose sleep time was in line with the National Sleep Foundations recommended sleep needs for teenagers (9hours or more).A total of 786 questionnaires were completed and 776 were exploitable. Four schools took part with 408/786 girls (64.2 %) and a mean age of 12.4±1.24. Internet access was almost universal (98.3 %), 85.2 % had cell phones and 42.7 % had a personal computer in their bedroom. Social media was used by 64.6 %. After dinner, 52.6 % spent more than an hour and 14.7 % spent more than 2hours in front of a screen. After bedtime, 51.7 % regularly used electronic devices of which 25.6 % had a screen-based activity (e.g. texts, social media, video games or television). During the night, some teens woke up to continue screen-based activities: 6.1 % in order to play online video games, .3 % to send texts and 11 % to use social media. Bedtimes were later in PR compared with  (22h06±132 vs. 23h54±02; P<.0001) as were wake times (7h06±36 vs. 10h06±102; P<.0001). Sleep time was clearly longer in PR (10h12±126 P<.0001) compared to . For students in 6th grade compared to 9th grade in sleep duration in SP decreased (8:55±90 vs. 7:25±93; P<.0001), whereas sleep duration during RP was stable (10h08±118 vs. 10h08±90 P<.029). No significant difference was found between girls and boys for sleep duration, sleep quality, performance during the day or mood. Sleep deprivation during the week (6hours or less) was less common in 6th graders 5 % vs.  % (P<.0001). In sleep deprived teens compared to teens sleeping, the recommended ≥9hours, difficulties falling asleep were reported with 33 % vs. 9 % taking over an hour to fall asleep (P<.0001) and difficulties getting up in the morning were more common (7.05±3.27 vs. 5.74±2.97; P=.0003). Sleep deprivation had an effect on daytime performance: teenagers deprived of sleep were more likely to report a need to fight sleepiness, (5.93±3.24 vs. 2.84±2.44 P<.0001) and had reduced energy during the day (6.21±2.86 vs. 7.77±2.07 P<.0001). A negative effect on mood was evident: in sleep, deprived teenagers irritability (5.28±3.12 vs. 3.30±2.34; P<.0001) and feelings of sadness (3.97±2.99 vs. 2.59±2.; P=.003) were more common. There was a clear association between sleep deprivation and access to screens and social media: sleep deprived teens were at more risk of nocturnal disruption with a higher prevalence of computers (67 % vs. 33 %; P<.0001), cell phones (99 % vs. 80 %; P=.0001) and smart phones (85 % vs. 66 %; P=.0001) in their bedrooms.Access to social media and especially a cell phone in teenagers' bedrooms is associated with a reduction in sleep time during the school week with negative effects on daily functioning and mood which increases with increasing age. Education about use of social media and sleep for teenagers needs to start early as modifications in sleep and evening use of screens was present on our population from 11years on and to involve parents as setting parent controlled bedtimes has been shown to increase teenage sleep time.Copyright © 2017 L'Encéphale, Paris.

Surgery with open healing by secondary intention typically is used to achieve the fastest healing time with minimal recurrence rates. A retrospective analysis was conducted of data extracted from the medical records of 73 consecutive patients who had symptomatic natal cleft  over a 10-year period to compare use of NPWT to alginate-based/gauze daily dressing (DD) changes in terms of healing time and recurrence. Variables extracted included age, gender,  wound diameter (small <1 cm, medium 1 cm to 3 cm, large >3 cm), and time in weeks to achieving the endpoint (epithelialization). Risk factors examined that can affect healing or recurrence of previously operated  disease included initial drainage before excision and risk factors for impaired healing (morbid  as determined by body mass index [BMI] ≥35, chronic infective skin conditions, and ongoing therapy with immuno-modulating drugs or chemotherapy), and loss to follow-up. Data were collected and analyzed using the chi-squared statistic, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression models. The total time of follow-up was 390 weeks for the DD group and 311 weeks for NPWT group. Patient mean age was 26.5 ± 10.7 years, most (53, 72.6%) were male, and 12 (16.4%) had comorbidities potentially affecting healing. Nine (9) were treated with primary closure and 62 patients were treated with open healing by secondary intention (2 additional patients receiving DD were excluded from the analysis because they had small sinuses that made NPWT unfeasible). Among participants, 30 (48%) received DD and 32 had NPWT. The median time to healing was 10 weeks (95% CI: 7-17) in the DD group and 8 weeks (95% CI: 7-9) in the NPWT group (not significantly different).
