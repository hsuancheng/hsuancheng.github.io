The present study evaluated the impact of OCA therapy on lipoprotein sub-particles.The study included 196 patients (99 OCA group and 97 placebo) who were enrolled in the FLINT trial and had samples available for lipid analysis and liver biopsies at enrollment and end-of-treatment (EOT) at 72 weeks. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles were evaluated at baseline, 12 and 72 weeks after randomization, and 24 weeks following EOT.Baseline lipoprotein profiles were similar among OCA and placebo. OCA did not impact total VLDL particle concentrations, but OCA vs placebo treatment was associated with decreased large VLDL particle concentration at 12 weeks (baseline adjusted mean: 6.8 vs. 8.9 nmol/L; P=0.002), mirrored by an increase in less-atherogenic small VLDL particle concentration (33.9 vs. 28.0 nmol/L; P=0.02). After 12 weeks, total LDL particle concentration was higher among OCA vs. placebo (1667 vs. 1329 nmol/L; P<0.0001), characterized by corresponding increases in both less-atherogenic, large-buoyant LDL (475 vs. 308 nmol/L; P=<0.001) and more-atherogenic small-dense LDL particles (1015 vs. 872 nmol/L; P=0.002). The changes in LDL particle concentrations were similar between treatment groups (OCA and placebo) 24 weeks following EOT due to improvement in OCA cohort. Compared to placebo, a reduction in total HDL-particle concentration, particularly large and medium HDL-particles, was noted in the OCA treated patients but this resolved after drug discontinuation.OCA therapy is associated with increases at 12 weeks in small VLDL particles and large and small LDL particles and reduction in HDL particles which revert to baseline 24 weeks after drug discontinuation. Lay Summary: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a chronic liver disease that is associated with increased risk of developing cirrhosis and cardiovascular disease. Recently, obeticholic acid (OCA), a farnesoid X receptor agonist, improved liver disease but led to an increase in cholesterol, however, the impact of OCA on cholesterol is not well understood. In the present study, we present data showing that OCA therapy is associated with an increase in lipoprotein levels which improve after drug discontinuation.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

So far, evidence is most comprehensive in cardiovascular and chronic renal diseases; however, published studies are prone to many biases, enabling us to reach a definite conclusion. Available data in chronic liver disease is scarce and ambiguous. Obesity is traditionally associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and steatosis in viral hepatitis and as such one would not expect the obesity paradox to be a real possibility in liver disease. Yet, there seem to be new data indicating the opposite - the obesity paradox exists in severe and end-stage liver cirrhosis, which could be attributed to a better lean mass in patients with higher body mass index, meaning that sarcopenia, as one of the most important prognostic factors of survival, is less likely to be present. Nonetheless, the problem of various methodological problems addressing the association between body weight and mortality, which is present both in liver disease and other chronic diseases, are preventing us from attaining an unanimous conclusion. Still, we should be aware that the obesity paradox might be true, especially in severe and end-stage illness. This suggests focusing our efforts toward preserving or building up fat-free mass and decreasing inflammatory activity responsible for catabolism and sarcopenia, and implying that the underlaying cause should be treated.© 2019 Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671697>Why Bile Acids Are So Important in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Progression.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex disease, affecting not just the liver, but also all other organs in the body. Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the liver-gut axis and especially the role of bile acids in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease inflammation and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile acid metabolism and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials. With the complexity of the issue, we did not aim at giving a complete review, rather highlighting important targets and potential treatments that could be approved for NAFLD/ treatment within the next few years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622581>Atrial Fibrillation and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>The most common causes of chronic liver disease in the developed world -nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () - are the hepatic manifestations of an insulin-resistant state that is linked to visceral adiposity and systemic inflammation. NAFLD and  lead to an expansion of epicardial adipose tissue and the release of proinflammatory adipocytokines that cause microcirculatory dysfunction and fibrosis of the adjoining myocardium, resulting in atrial fibrillation as well as heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Inflammatory changes in the left atrium lead to electroanatomical remodeling; thus, NAFLD and  markedly increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. Simultaneously, patients with NAFLD or  commonly show diastolic dysfunction or latent HFpEF. Interventions include (1) weight loss by caloric restriction, bariatric surgery or intensive exercise; and (2) drugs that ameliorate fat-mediated inflammation in both the liver and heart (e.g., statins, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and pioglitazone). Patients with NAFLD or  commonly have an inflammation-related atrial and ventricular myopathy, which may contribute to symptoms and long-term outcomes.Copyright © 2019.

The etiology of this disease is known in 90% of the patients, and it is viral in most of the cases. According to recent predictions, nearly half of the world population will be suffering from obesity by 2030. Consequently, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may play a growing role in HCC epidemiology. In this review, we sought to explore the relationship between liver steatosis and HCC. A narrative review was conducted using the PubMed MeSH search. The eligible papers were identified using a standard PubMed search with relevant key terms and various synonyms. According to the results, patients with NAFLD-HCC tended to be older than those with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-HCC, and they were more often obese and had concomitant diseases, such as diabetes. On the other hand, the synthetic liver function was better preserved in NAFLD-HCC patients, who also obtained lower scores on the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP). However, it has to be noted that HCC in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () may develop without underlying cirrhosis. Although -HCC is usually smaller and well-differentiated compared to HCV-HCC, the prognosis is similar in both groups. Efficient HCC screening in  cirrhosis poses a challenge because it is difficult to perform ultrasound examination in obese patients and alfa-fetoprotein level is no longer considered reliable. The constantly increasing prevalence of NAFLD in the general population can contribute to a growing role of NAFLD/ in HCC epidemiology. Moreover, some particular challenges specific for patients with liver steatosis may impede proper HCC diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610081>Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis after Liver Transplantation.</a></h2><p>Currently, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is the second leading indication for liver transplant (LT), behind alcohol-related liver disease. After transplant, both recurrent and de novo nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are common, however, recurrence rates of  and advanced fibrosis are low. Identification of high-risk groups and optimizing treatment of metabolic co-morbidities both pre- and post-LT is paramount to maintaining a healthy allograft, especially with the additional consequences of long-term immunosuppression. In addition,  LT recipients are at increased risk of cardiovascular events and malignancy, and warrant a tailored approach to management. The optimal approach to  LT recipients including metabolic co-morbidities management, tailored immunosuppression, the role of bariatric surgery, and nutritional and pharmacotherapy of  are discussed in this review. Overall, aggressive management of metabolic syndrome post LT via medical and surgical modalities, and a minimalist approach to immunosuppression is advised.Copyright © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692928>Substituent Effects on the Reactivity of the 2,4,6-Tridehydropyridinium Cation, an Aromatic σ,σ,σ-Triradical.</a></h2><p>2,4,6-Tridehydropyridinium cation () undergoes three consecutive atom or atom group abstractions from reagent molecules in the gas phase. By placing a π-electron-donating hydroxyl group between two radical sites, their reactivity can be quenched by enhancing their through-space coupling via a favorable resonance structure. Indeed, 3-hydroxy-2,4,6-tridehydropyridinium cation () abstracts only one atom or group of atoms from reagents. On the other hand, an electron-withdrawing cyano group between two of the radical sites () destabilizes the analogous resonance structure and diminishes through-space coupling between the radical sites, resulting in abstraction of three atoms, just like . However, the cyano-substituent also increases acidity to the point that  reacts pre-dominantly via proton transfer instead of undergoing radical reactions. Therefore, acidic triradicals may undergo nonradical, barrierless proton transfer reactions faster than radical reactions, which are usually accompanied by barriers. Examination of the analogous cyano-substituted mono-and biradicals revealed behavior similar to that of the corresponding unsubstituted species, with the exception of substantially greater reactivities due to their greater (calculated) vertical electron affinities. Finally, the 3-cyano-2,6-didehydropyridinium cation with a singlet ground state (S-T splitting: -11.9 kcal mol) was found to react exclusively from the lowest-energy triplet state by fast proton transfer reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671047>Clinical significance of  2-alkyl-4-quinolone quorum-sensing signal molecules for long-term outcomes in adults with cystic fibrosis.</a></h2><p>  is an important respiratory pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF), which is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function, frequent pulmonary exacerbations and increased mortality.  produces intercellular signalling molecules including 2-alkyl-4-quinolones (AQs), which regulate virulence-factor production and biofilm formation in the CF airways. Studies have shown that AQs are detectable in the sputum and plasma of adults with CF and chronic pulmonary . We tested the hypothesis that the presence of six AQs in plasma or sputum obtained from adults with CF was associated with long-term adverse clinical outcomes. We analysed clinical data over an 8 year follow period for 90 people with CF who had previously provided samples for AQ analysis at clinical stability. The primary outcome was all cause mortality or lung transplantation. Secondary outcomes were the rate of lung-function decline and the number of intravenous (IV) antibiotic days for pulmonary exacerbations. There was no statistical association between the presence of any of the six measured AQs and the primary outcomes or the secondary outcome of decline in lung function. One of the six AQs was associated with IV antibiotic usage. The presence of 2-nonyl-3-hydroxy-4(1 h)-quinolone (C9-PQS) in sputum was associated with an increase in the number of IV antibiotic days in the follow-up period (Mann-Whitney; =0.011).

Global MS-based metabolomics and targeted metabolite profiling of catechins/catechin metabolites are evaluated. GTE in HF mice restores hepatic metabolites implicated in dyslipidemia insulin resistance, and inflammation. These include 122 metabolites: amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, vitamins, bile acids, flavonoids, xenobiotics, and carbohydrates. Hepatic amino acids, B-vitamins, and bile acids are inversely correlated with biomarkers of insulin resistance, liver injury, steatosis, and inflammation. Further, phosphatidylcholine metabolites are positively correlated with biomarkers of liver injury and NFκB inflammation. Thirteen catechin metabolites are identified in livers of GTE-treated mice, mostly as phase II conjugates of parental catechins or microbial-derived valerolactones.The defined anti-inflammatory/metabolic interactions advance an understanding of the mechanism by which GTE catechins protect against NFκB-mediated liver injury in .© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, in the progression from  to cirrhosis, hepatic fat is often lost. Our aim was to elucidate the mechanism underlying hepatic fat loss during  progression.Liver biopsies were performed at The University of Tokyo Hospital between November 2011 and March 2016 on 146 patients with NAFLD and 14 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis who were not being treated with any diabetes or dyslipidemia drugs. Among them, 70 patients underwent liver biopsy after an overnight fast, and 90 patients were biopsied 5 h after an oral glucose tolerance test. Expression differences in genes encoding several fatty acid metabolism-related factors were examined and correlated with hepatic histological changes based on NAFLD activity scores. Prospective patient follow-up continued until June 2018.The level of fatty acid transport protein 5 (FATP5), which is associated with free fatty acid intake, was significantly and inversely correlated with features of histological progression, including ballooning and fibrosis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Transcript levels of genes encoding fatty acid metabolism-related proteins were comparable between  with severe fibrosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Furthermore, a prospective cohort study demonstrated that low FATP5 expression was the most significant risk factor for hepatic fat loss.Decreased hepatic FATP5 expression in NAFLD is linked to histological progression, and may be associated with hepatic fat loss during  progression to cirrhosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556124>Clinical utility of an increase in magnetic resonance elastography in predicting fibrosis progression in NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Cross-sectional studies have shown that magnetic-resonance-elastography (MRE) is accurate in non-invasive detection of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD. However, there are limited data on the longitudinal association between an increase in liver-stiffness on MRE and fibrosis progression in NAFLD. Therefore, utilizing a well-characterized prospective cohort of patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, we aimed to examine the longitudinal association between a 15% increase in liver-stiffness on MRE and fibrosis progression in NAFLD.This prospective cohort study including 102 patients (62.7% women) with biopsy-proven NAFLD who underwent contemporaneous MRE and liver biopsy at baseline followed by a repeat paired liver biopsy and MRE assessment. Primary outcome was odds of fibrosis progression by ≥ 1 stage as assessed by  CRN-Histologic-Scoring-System.The mean (±SD) of age and BMI were 52 (±14) years and 32.6 (±5.3) kg/m , respectively. The median time interval between the two paired assessment was 1.4 years (interquartile range: 2.15 years). The number of patients with fibrosis stages 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 27, 36, 12, 17, and 10, respectively. In unadjusted analysis, a 15% increase in MRE was associated with increased odds of histologic fibrosis progression (OR=3.56, 95% CI:1.17 - 10.76, p=0.0248). These findings remained clinically and statistically significant even after multivariable-adjustment for age, sex, and BMI (adjusted OR=3.36, 95% CI:1.10 - 10.31, p=0.0339). A 15% increase in MRE was the strongest predictor of progression to advanced fibrosis (OR=4.90, 95%CI:1.35-17.84, p=0.0159).A 15% increase in liver stiffness on MRE may be associated with histologic fibrosis progression and progression from early fibrosis to advanced fibrosis.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672994>The AgeGuess database, an open online resource on chronological and perceived ages of people aged 5-100.</a></h2><p>In many developed countries, human life expectancy has doubled over the last 180 years.

However, the role of mainstream CS (MSCS) in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () remains unclear. During the first (early exposure) or last (late exposure) three weeks of methionine-choline deficient with high fat diet feeding (6 weeks), each diet group was exposed to MSCS (300 or 600 μg/L). Hepatic or serum biochemical analysis showed that MSCS differentially modulated hepatic injury in  milieu, depending on exposure time points. Consistently, -related hepatocellular apoptosis and fibrosis were increased in the early exposure group, but decreased in the late exposure group, except for steatosis. Ex vivo experiments showed that CS extract differentially regulated inflammatory responses in co-cultured hepatocytes and macrophages isolated from steatohepatitic livers after 10 days or 3 weeks of diet feeding. Furthermore, CS differentially up- and down-regulated the expression levels of M1/M2 polarization markers and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) in livers (29% and 38%, respectively) or co-cultured macrophages (2 and 2.5 fold, respectively). Collectively, our findings indicate that opposite effects of MSCS on  progression are mediated by differential modulation of PPARγ and its-associated M1/M2 polarization in hepatic macrophages, depending on exposure time points.Copyright © 2019.

The mean cathepsin D level was not significantly different between NAFLD patients and controls; between  and non- patients; and across the different steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of cathepsin D for the diagnosis of NAFLD and  was 0.62 and 0.52, respectively. The AUROC of cathepsin D for the diagnosis of the different steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades ranged from 0.51 to 0.58. Of the 216 liver biopsies, 152 were paired liver biopsies from 76 patients who had a repeat liver biopsy after 48 weeks. There was no significant change in the cathepsin D level at follow-up compared to baseline in patients who had histological improvement or worsening for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades. Cathepsin D was poor for predicting improvement or worsening of steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning, with AUROC ranging from 0.47 to 0.54.

Both NAS-CRN and SAF scoring systems were applied for histopathological evaluation. PNPLA3 and TMS6F2 genotyping were also performed.All of the 84 patients were histologically diagnosed with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), with 36 of them (42.9%) being non-obese (BMI < 25 kg/m). Compared with the obese group, non-obese group were predominantly females (88.9% vs 52.1%, p < 0.001), tended to have higher prevalence of diabetes (p = 0.068). More importantly non-obese patients had a significant higher prevalence of advanced fibrosis (F ≥ 3) (58.3% vs 29.2%, p = 0.013), and a trend of higher degree of ballooning (p = 0.061). In addition, values of liver stiffness measurement were also significantly higher in non-obese group (12.1 kPa vs 8.1 kPa, p = 0.032). There was also a trend of higher prevalence of TM6SF2 T allele in non-obese group (p = 0.085), while the prevalence of PNPLA3 risk allele did not differ between two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that higher fasting glucose (p = 0.038) and lower serum platelets (p = 0.040) were two independent predictors for advanced fibrosis in non-obese patients.Non-obese  patients have a female predominance and more advanced fibrosis.

It is tightly associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity and both of these conditions drive progressive disease towards the more advanced stages.

We measured total mercury (THg) and nitrogen stable isotopes in nape and head feathers grown during winter, respectively. THg concentration of kittiwake nape feathers averaged 4.61 ± 0.97 μg/g dry weight. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify winter habitats with remotely sensed environmental variables along each bird's track. Five habitat clusters were identified.

In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of the synthetic miR-223 analog miR-223 3p in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/D-GalN-induced endotoxin acute hepatitis (EAH) or fibrotic  resultant of long-term feeding with a high-fat, fructose, and cholesterol (FFC) diet. miR-223 3p ameliorated the infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils, and early activated macrophages and downregulated the transcriptional expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines Il6 and Il12 and the chemokines Ccl2, Ccl3, Cxcl1, and Cxcl2 in EAH. In fibrotic , treatment with miR-223 3p led to a remarkable mitigation of fibrosis development and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). miR-223 3p disrupted the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by impairing the synthesis of cleaved interleukin-1β (IL-1β), mature IL-1β, and NLRP3, and the activation of caspase-1 p10 in both EAH and fibrotic . Our data enlightens miR-223 3p as a post-transcriptional approach to treat acute and chronic hepatitis by silencing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.Copyright © 2019 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

Recent studies suggest that patients with HIV are at high risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and progressive liver fibrosis. Evidence for the prevalence, risk factors, and diagnostic methodologies of NAFLD in patients with HIV mono-infection is summarized here.Although limited, published studies suggest that the prevalence of NAFLD is higher (30-50%) and progresses at an increased rate in patients with HIV compared to the general population. Identifying those at risk for significant liver fibrosis is critical, preferably with non-invasive screening tests. While there is a paucity of evidence in this population, transient elastography (TE) appears to provide a sensitive, non-invasive screening modality. Identifying NAFLD early will allow for dietary and lifestyle interventions, as well as future drug therapies to decrease the risk of progressive liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in the high-risk HIV population. Clinicians should be aware of this risk and consider using TE for NAFLD diagnosis and surveillance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634732>Relevance of the interpersonal theory of suicide in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient population.</a></h2><p>The interpersonal theory of suicide (IPTS) has been widely studied in adults, but not adolescent populations at acute risk for suicide. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate IPTS clinical utility in a high-risk sample of suicidal adolescent inpatients. We assessed whether constructs of the IPTS (1) are associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) on admission to a psychiatric hospitalization, and (2) prospectively predict suicide attempt (SA) or psychiatric rehospitalization 90 days after discharge. On admission, adolescent patients self-reported recent STBs, perceived burdensomeness (PB), thwarted belongingness (TB), and depression. Parents reported their child's rehospitalization and suicide attempts 90 days after discharge. Generalized linear regression modelling was used to determine how key constructs of the IPTS are associated with STBs prior to admission and whether they prospectively predict SA or rehospitalization 90 days after discharge. IPTS constructs did not predict rehospitalization or SA within 90 days of discharge. Although PB and TB interacted to associate with prehospitalization SI frequency, and PB, TB and NSSI interacted to associate with prehospitalization SA, the nature of these interactions were not as the IPTS predicts. IPTS constructs are relevant proximal predictors of prehospitalization STB in adolescents, but may operate differently than in adults.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It has been observed previously that the enamel on the labial surface of the teeth used for extraction is thicker relative to that on the lingual surface in taxa that extract gums, while enamel is more evenly distributed in the anterior teeth of taxa that do not regularly engage in extractive behaviors. This study presents a quantitative methodology for measuring the distribution of labial versus lingual enamel thickness among primate and marsupial taxa in the context of gummivory. Computed microtomography scans of 15 specimens representing 14 taxa were analyzed. Ten measurements were taken at 20% intervals starting from the base of the crown of the extractive tooth to the tip of the cutting edge across the lingual and labial enamel. A method for including worn or broken teeth is also presented. Mann-Whitney U tests, canonical variates analysis, and between-group principal components analysis were used to examine variation in enamel thickness across taxa. Our results suggest that the differential distribution of enamel thickness in the anterior dentition can serve as a signal for gouging behavior; this methodology distinguishes between gougers, scrapers, and nonextractive gummivores. Gouging taxa are characterized by significantly thicker labial enamel relative to the lingual enamel, particularly towards the crown tip. Examination of enamel thickness patterning in these taxa permits a better understanding of the adaptations for the extraction of gums in extant taxa and offers the potential to test hypotheses concerning the dietary adaptations of fossil taxa.© 2019 S.

Possible reasons for the NAFLD epidemic in industrialized countries are the high intake of pro-inflammatory n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFAs) and low consumption of healthy n-3 PUFAs. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, n-3 PUFAs may have the potential to alleviate chronic liver disease.

Dysregulated metabolism of sphingomyelin in the liver plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Ceramides are central molecules of sphingolipid biosynthesis and catabolism and play an important role in insulin resistance, apoptosis, and inflammation. In addition, apoptosis is a main contributor to the development of NAFLD. This study detected whether the inhibition of ceramide synthesis ameliorated hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in rats with NAFLD. Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish the NAFLD model. Here, we showed that hepatic ceramide, steatosis, and fibrosis increased in liver tissue from rats with NAFLD. Chronic treatment with myriocin inhibited ceramide and lipid accumulation and improved fibrosis in liver tissue samples of high fat diet (HFD)-fed rats. In addition, hepatic inflammation and apoptosis were markedly ameliorated in HFD-fed rats treated with myriocin. Furthermore, myriocin treatment regulated the expression of pro-apoptosis and anti-apoptosis proteins by inactivating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in the liver of HFD-fed rats.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high-fat diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10). Liver histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with fatty acid with or without myriocin treatment.

By introducing a concentrated P source, fertilizers increase short-term P export potential soon after their application and longer-term export potential by increasing soil fertility (legacy P). The 4R concept was developed to help mitigate P exports from the fertilizers that sustain agricultural productivity. This review investigates the factors affecting P exports soon after the application of mineral fertilizers to pasture-based grazing systems and studies quantifying its potential impact in different systems, with an emphasis on Australasia. Initially, P fertilizers and reactions that might affect their short-term P export potential are reviewed, along with P transport pathways, the forms of P exported from grazing systems, factors affecting P mobilization into water, and studies demonstrating the possible short-term effects of fertilizer application on P exports. Using that foundation, we review studies quantifying the short-term impact of fertilizer application in different regions; they show that under poor management, recently applied fertilizer can contribute a considerable proportion (30-80%) of total farm P exports in drainage, but when fertilizer is well-managed, that figure is expected to be <10%. We then use three model systems of varying hydrology that are common to Australasia to demonstrate the principles for selecting fertilizers that are likely to minimize P exports soon after their application.© 2019 The Author(s).

Differences in developmental patterns between humans and mice include spatiotemporal expansion of both ventricular and rhombic lip primary progenitor zones to include subventricular zones containing basal progenitors. The human rhombic lip persists longer through cerebellar development than in the mouse and undergoes morphological changes to form a progenitor pool in the posterior lobule, which is not seen in other organisms, not even in the nonhuman primate the macaque. Disruptions in human rhombic lip development are associated with posterior cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and Dandy-Walker malformation.

However, the roles of BAFF during liver regeneration are not well defined. In this study, C57/B6 mice with 70% partial hepatectomy were used as a liver regeneration model. BAFF expression was determined by enzyme immunoassay, and anti-BAFF-neutralizing antibodies were administered to confirm the effects of BAFF on liver regeneration. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and florescence staining determined the expression of B-cell CCL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10). The angiogenesis promoting capability was evaluated after the transfection of cells with siRNA targeting BCL10 expression, and the role of NF-κB was assessed. The results revealed that the BAFF and BCL10 levels were upregulated after partial hepatectomy. Treatment with anti-BAFF-neutralizing antibodies caused death in mice that were subjected to 70% partial hepatectomy within 72 h. In vitro, recombinant BAFF protein did not enhance hepatocyte proliferation; however, transfection with BCL10 siRNA arrested hepatocytes at the G2/M phase.

Hepatic accumulation of free cholesterol induces activation of nonparenchymal cells, including Kupffer cells, macrophages, and hepatic stellate cells, which leads to persistent inflammation and fibrosis. The nuclear receptors liver X receptor α (LXRα) and LXRβ act as negative regulators of cholesterol metabolism through the induction of hepatocyte cholesterol catabolism, excretion, and the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. Additionally, LXRs exert an anti-inflammatory effect in immune cell types, such as macrophages. LXR activation suppresses acute hepatic inflammation that is mediated by Kupffer cells/macrophages. Acute liver injury, diet-induced steatohepatitis, and fibrosis are exacerbated by significant hepatic cholesterol accumulation and inflammation in LXR-deficient mice.

Epidemiologic evidence suggests non-polio enteroviruses (EVs) are a potential etiology, yet EV RNA is rarely detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF from children with AFM (n = 42) and other pediatric neurologic disease controls (n = 58) were investigated for intrathecal antiviral antibodies, using a phage display library expressing 481,966 overlapping peptides derived from all known vertebrate and arboviruses (VirScan). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of AFM CSF RNA (n = 20 cases) was also performed, both unbiased sequencing and with targeted enrichment for EVs. Using VirScan, the viral family significantly enriched by the CSF of AFM cases relative to controls was Picornaviridae, with the most enriched Picornaviridae peptides belonging to the genus Enterovirus (n = 29/42 cases versus 4/58 controls). EV VP1 ELISA confirmed this finding (n = 22/26 cases versus 7/50 controls). mNGS did not detect additional EV RNA. Despite rare detection of EV RNA, pan-viral serology frequently identified high levels of CSF EV-specific antibodies in AFM compared with controls, providing further evidence for a causal role of non-polio EVs in AFM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618976>The Potential of the FSP1cre- Mouse Model for Studying Juvenile NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can progress from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () characterized by liver inflammation, possibly leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mice with impaired macrophage activation, when fed a high-fat diet, develop severe . Evidence is mounting that Kupffer cells are implicated. However, it is unknown whether the resident CD68 or bone marrow-derived CD11b Kupffer cells are involved. Characterization of the FSP1cre-Pparb/d mouse liver revealed that FSP1 is expressed in CD11b Kupffer cells. Although these cells only constitute a minute fraction of the liver cell population,  deletion in these cells led to remarkable hepatic phenotypic changes. We report that a higher lipid content was present in postnatal day 2 (P2) FSP1cre- livers, which diminished after weaning. Quantification of total lipids and triglycerides revealed that P2 and week 4 of age FSP1cre- livers have higher levels of both. qPCR analysis also showed upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, and fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis pathways. This result is further supported by western blot analysis of proteins in these pathways. Hence, we propose that FSP1cre- mice, which accumulate lipids in their liver in early life, may represent a useful animal model to study juvenile NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634046>Oral Administration of  Alleviates Insulin Resistance and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is recognized as a proinflammatory condition leading to hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().

The primary objective was to evaluate whether IXE was superior to ADA at week 24 for simultaneous achievement of a ≥50% improvement from baseline in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR50) and a 100% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI100). Major secondary objectives, also at week 24, were to evaluate whether IXE was: (1) non-inferior to ADA for achievement of ACR50 and (2) superior to ADA for PASI100 response. Additional PsA, skin, treat-to-target and quality-of-life outcome measures were assessed at week 24.The primary efficacy endpoint was met (IXE: 36%, ADA: 28%; p=0.036). IXE was non-inferior for ACR50 response (IXE: 51%, ADA: 47%; treatment difference: 3.9%) and superior for PASI100 response (IXE: 60%, ADA: 47%; p=0.001). IXE had greater response versus ADA in additional PsA, skin, nail, treat-to-target and quality-of-life outcomes. Serious adverse events were reported in 8.5% (ADA) and 3.5% (IXE) of patients.IXE was superior to ADA in achievement of simultaneous improvement of joint and skin disease (ACR50 and PASI100) in patients with PsA and inadequate response to csDMARDs.

Although there is emerging evidence of common involvement of the cognitive control network (CCN) of the brain in these domains, this network has mostly been linked to the processing of conflict, which is just one case of an increase in uncertainty. Here, we conducted an activation-likelihood-estimation-based large-scale meta-analysis of 289 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in the three domains to examine the common involvement of the CCN in uncertainty processing by contrasting the high-uncertainty versus low-uncertainty conditions. We found a general association between increase in uncertainty and an activation increase in regions of the CCN, including the frontoparietal network (comprising the frontal eye fields, the areas near/along the intraparietal sulcus, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), the cingulo-opercular network (including the anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area, and the anterior insular cortex), and a subcortical structure (the striatum). These results demonstrate that the CCN is a domain-general construct underlying uncertainty processing to support goal-directed behaviors. This article is protected by copyright.

This study proposes a framework that incorporates two game theory models designed for the allocation of police officers to patrol shifts. In the first step, the interactions of three factors between the criminal and the operation captain are modeled as a zero-sum, noncooperative game, after which a mixed strategy  equilibrium method is used to derive the risk value for each district to be patrolled. In the second step, the risk values are used to compute the Shapley value for all 10 districts, for three different threat levels. A fair allocation of police personnel based on the Shapley value is made with a minimum set of personnel deployment costs. The efficacy of the proposed method is verified using openly available data from the San Francisco City Police detailing incidents from the year 2016. The experimental results show that police planners can use this framework to quantitatively evaluate the criminal threat in each district when deciding upon the deployment of patrol officers for three shifts per day.© 2019 Society for Risk Analysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619789>Habenular TCF7L2 links nicotine addiction to diabetes.</a></h2><p>Diabetes is far more prevalent in smokers than non-smokers, but the underlying mechanisms of vulnerability are unknown. Here we show that the diabetes-associated gene Tcf7l2 is densely expressed in the medial habenula (mHb) region of the rodent brain, where it regulates the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Inhibition of TCF7L2 signalling in the mHb increases nicotine intake in mice and rats. Nicotine increases levels of blood glucose by TCF7L2-dependent stimulation of the mHb. Virus-tracing experiments identify a polysynaptic connection from the mHb to the pancreas, and wild-type rats with a history of nicotine consumption show increased circulating levels of glucagon and insulin, and diabetes-like dysregulation of blood glucose homeostasis. By contrast, mutant Tcf7l2 rats are resistant to these actions of nicotine. Our findings suggest that TCF7L2 regulates the stimulatory actions of nicotine on a habenula-pancreas axis that links the addictive properties of nicotine to its diabetes-promoting actions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620652>Effect of alcohol consumption on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is estimated to be 26.3% among the US population. A subset of this population exhibits an aggressive histological phenotype, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () with ≥ stage 2 fibrosis, which may progress to cirrhosis. The definition of NAFLD excludes excessive alcohol intake, which is well known to cause alcoholic liver disease and will not be discussed here. Most NAFLD clinical trials use ~14 drinks per week as the cutoff for excessive alcohol intake. Alcohol consumption below this threshold, which we define as moderate alcohol consumption, is common in the US. According to the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 56% of the US adult population consume alcohol, but only 8.2% report drinking heavily and 18.3% report binge drinking. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidance of 2018 states that there are insufficient data to make a recommendation with regard to moderate alcohol consumption in patients with NAFLD, citing a lack of longitudinal studies that examine the impact of moderate alcohol consumption on disease progression and its extrahepatic harms versus benefits, specifically in individuals with established NAFLD. NAFLD prevalence studies have generally noted a negative correlation between modest alcohol consumption and NAFLD. However, prevalence studies have limited application to patients with established NAFLD who present to the clinic. There can also be many confounding factors, because modest alcohol consumption is also negatively associated with some NAFLD risk factors, and those risk factors may not be adequately adjusted for in analyses. The prevalence of  with significant fibrosis (≥ F2) is more important because this is the group that is believed to have progressive disease. Thus, cohort studies of disease progression are more important from the patient's standpoint. Because these patients have already developed NAFLD or , their interest lies in their odds of disease progression if they have moderate alcohol consumption compared to abstinence. It is also noteworthy that cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of death among patients with NAFLD. Moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with a reduction in overall mortality, but mostly in cardiovascular mortality. However, this protective effect has not been demonstrated specifically in patients with NAFLD.2019 Translational Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

However, the role of melanocytes in the process is understudied. Our data show that melanocytes are the only epidermal cell type to express the senescence marker p16 during human skin ageing. Aged melanocytes also display additional markers of senescence such as reduced HMGB1 and dysfunctional telomeres, without detectable telomere shortening. Additionally, senescent melanocyte SASP induces telomere dysfunction in paracrine manner and limits proliferation of surrounding cells via activation of CXCR3-dependent mitochondrial ROS. Finally, senescent melanocytes impair basal keratinocyte proliferation and contribute to epidermal atrophy in vitro using 3D human epidermal equivalents. Crucially, clearance of senescent melanocytes using the senolytic drug ABT737 or treatment with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ suppressed this effect. In conclusion, our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that senescent melanocytes affect keratinocyte function and act as drivers of human skin ageing.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623428>Implementation of "Treat-all" at adult HIV care and treatment sites in the Global IeDEA Consortium: results from the Site Assessment Survey.</a></h2><p>Since 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that all people living with HIV (PLHIV) initiate antiretroviral treatment (ART), irrespective of CD4+ count or clinical stage. National adoption of universal treatment has accelerated since WHO's 2015 "Treat All" recommendation; however, little is known about the translation of this guidance into practice. This study aimed to assess the status of Treat All implementation across regions, countries, and levels of the health care delivery system.Between June and December 2017, 201/221 (91%) adult HIV treatment sites that participate in the global IeDEA research consortium completed a survey on capacity and practices related to HIV care. Located in 41 countries across seven geographic regions, sites provided information on the status and timing of site-level introduction of Treat All, as well as site-level practices related to ART initiation.Almost all sites (93%) reported that they had begun implementing Treat All, and there were no statistically significant differences in site-level Treat All introduction by health facility type, urban/rural location, sector (public/private) or country income level. The median time between national policy adoption and site-level introduction was one month. In countries where Treat All was not yet adopted in national guidelines, 69% of sites reported initiating all patients on ART, regardless of clinical criteria, and these sites had been implementing Treat All for a median period of seven months at the time of the survey. The majority of sites (77%) reported typically initiating patients on ART within 14 days of confirming diagnosis, with 60% to 62% of sites implementing Treat All in East, Southern and West Africa reporting same-day ART initiation for most patients.By mid- to late-2017, the Treat All strategy was the standard of care at almost all IeDEA sites, including rural, primary-level health facilities in low-resource settings. While further assessments of site-level capacity to provide high-quality HIV care under Treat All and to support sustained viral suppression after ART initiation are needed, the widespread introduction of Treat All at the service delivery level is a critical step towards global targets for ending the HIV epidemic as a public health threat.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. Studying mice, we find that the number of motor units (MUs) can be maintained by counteracting neurotoxic microglia in the aged spinal cord. We observe that marked innervation changes, detected by motor unit number estimation (MUNE), occur prior to loss of muscle function in aged mice. This coincides with gene expression changes indicative of neuronal remodeling and microglial activation in aged spinal cord. Voluntary exercise prevents loss of MUs and reverses microglia activation. Depleting microglia by CSF1R inhibition also prevents the age-related decline in MUNE and neuromuscular junction disruption, implying a causal link. Our results suggest that age-related changes in spinal cord microglia contribute to neuromuscular decline in aged mice and demonstrate that removal of aged neurotoxic microglia can prevent or reverse MU loss.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In rats, higher incidences of stereotypic behaviors were observed in 10 mg/kg females and 40 mg/kg males, and slower responses for reflex and sensory tests were observed only in males at 10 and 40 mg/kg during neurobehavioral testing. Sporadic minimal incidences of decreased activity (males) and seizures (both sexes) were observed in rats during daily clinical observations, without any clear dose-relationship. Male dogs at 75 mg/kg during treatment period, but not recovery period, had an increased incidence of gut associated lymphoid tissue hyperplasia and inflammation in the intestine. In both species, highest dose resulted in lower AUCs indicative of non-linear kinetics.

Although majority of patients with NAFLD are benign and non-progressive, having only steatosis, some fraction of patients develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), which can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and eventually increased liver-related mortality. Among histological features of NAFLD, it has been reported that liver fibrosis is the most important predictor of long-term outcomes. Liver fibrosis is a dynamic process characterized by the over-accumulation of extracellular matrix due to chronic liver injury resulting from any etiology including not only , but also viral infection and alcoholic liver disease. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) has been well established as a central driver of fibrosis in experimental animal models and human liver injury. It is a transdifferentiation of quiescent, vitamin-A‑storing cells into proliferative and fibrogenic myofibroblasts. However, the discovery of novel pathways and mediators reveals the complexity of HSC activation. These emerging pathways include hedgehog, autophagy, free cholesterol, YAP1, hepcidin, and nuclear/G-protein coupled receptor-mediated signals. In addition, pathways of HSC clearance have been uncovered such as apoptosis, senescence, and reversion to an inactivated state. Thus, clarifying the underlying mechanisms of HSC activation could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for , and several drug candidates are currently being developed in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628409>Accuracy of proton magnetic resonance for diagnosing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Liver biopsy is the reference standard test to differentiate between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and simple steatosis (SS) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but noninvasive diagnostics are warranted.

We performed a direct, quantitative comparison of hepatic fibrosis progression in well-defined methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) and choline-deficient, amino-acid defined (CDAA) diets with increasing fat content (10-60% by calories) in C57Bl/6J and BALB/cAnNCrl mice.In C57Bl/6J mice, MCD feeding resulted in moderate fibrosis at week 8 (2-fold increase in hepatic collagen content) and progressive weight loss, irrespective of fat content. In contrast, CDAA-fed mice did not lose weight and developed progressive fibrosis starting from week 4. High dietary fat in the CDAA diet model dose-dependently induced the lipid metabolism genes SREBP and SCD2, and increased the ductular reaction and fibrosis. Longitudinal analysis of CDAA with 60% fat (HF-CDAA) feeding revealed pronounced ductular reaction and perisinusoidal bridging fibrosis, with a 7-fold increase of hepatic collagen at week 12, that showed limited spontaneous reversibility. At 24 weeks, HF-CDAA mice developed signs of cirrhosis with 10-fold HYP increase, regenerative nodules, portal hypertension and elevated serum bilirubin and ammonia; 80% of mice (8/10) developed multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). High fat supplementation of MCD in C57Bl/6J, or feeding HF-CDAA diet to fibrosis-prone BALB/cAnNCrl strain failed to result in increased fibrosis.In conclusion, HF-CDAA feeding in C57Bl/6J mice was identified as an optimal model of steatohepatitis with robust fibrosis and ductular proliferations that progress to cirrhosis and HCC within 24 weeks.

Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to Cd is implicated in the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in middle-aged human population, but biological evidence is lack and its toxicological mechanism remains unclear for the disease predisposition from environmental Cd exposure. In this study, we established a chronic Cd-exposure mouse model mimicking the liver Cd deposition in middle-aged human population to determine whether the environmental Cd exposure can induce NAFLD. Results showed that hepatic Cd burden at levels of 0.95 and 6.04 μg/g wet weight resulting from 20-week Cd exposure at different doses induced NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ()-like phenotypes in mice, respectively. The Cd exposure caused marked hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and fatty acid oxidation deficiency, along with significant suppression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling pathway in the liver. In vitro study confirmed that Cd evidently inhibited mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes and that SIRT1 signaling was potentially involved in the process.

Here, we addressed GAS6/TAM involvement in Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis () development.GAS6/TAM signaling was analyzed in cultured primary hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and Kupffer cells (KCs). Axl, Mertk and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were fed with Chow, High Fat Choline-Deficient Methionine-Restricted (HFD) or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet. HSC activation, liver inflammation and cytokine/chemokine production were measured by qPCR, mRNA Array analysis, western blotting and ELISA. GAS6, soluble AXL (sAXL) and MERTK (sMERTK) levels were analyzed in control individuals, steatotic and  patients.In primary mouse cultures, GAS6 or MERTK activation protected primary hepatocytes against lipid toxicity via AKT/STAT-3 signaling, while bemcentinib (small molecule AXL inhibitor BGB324) blocked AXL-induced fibrogenesis in primary HSCs and cytokine production in LPS-treated KCs. Accordingly; bemcentinib diminished liver inflammation and fibrosis in MCD- and HFD-fed mice. Upregulation of AXL and ADAM10/ADAM17 metalloproteinases increased sAXL in HFD-fed mice. Transcriptome profiling revealed major reduction in fibrotic- and inflammatory-related genes in HFD-fed mice after bemcentinib administration. HFD-fed Mertk mice exhibited enhanced , while Axl mice were partially protected. In human serum, sAXL levels augmented even at initial stages, whereas GAS6 and sMERTK increased only in cirrhotic  patients. In agreement, sAXL increased in HFD-fed mice before fibrosis establishment, while bemcentinib prevented liver fibrosis/inflammation in early .AXL signaling, increased in  patients, promotes fibrosis in HSCs and inflammation in KCs, while GAS6 protects cultured hepatocytes against lipotoxicity via MERTK.

We investigated reliable contraceptive use at baseline and six months in key-populations in Uganda, during two Simulated HIV Vaccine Efficacy trials (SiVETs). SiVETs were nested within observational cohorts of Fisherfolk (2012-2014) and Female sex workers (2014-2017). Women in the observational cohorts were screened and enrolled into the SiVET. The trial administered a licensed Hepatitis B vaccine at 0, 1 and 6 months. Contraceptive use data were recorded at baseline and follow-up clinic visits. Reliable contraceptives (injectable Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA), implant, pills, and intrauterine device (IUD)) were promoted and provided to women not using a reliable method at enrolment. Overall, 367 women were enrolled. At baseline 203 (55%) reported use of reliable contraceptive. Of the 164 women not using a reliable method at enrolment, 131 (80%) started using them during follow-up bringing the overall number to 334 (91%) at the end of follow-up. Young age (≤35 years) was an independent predictor of reliable contraceptive use at both time points while other factors varied. Promotion and provision of reliable contraceptives increased the proportion using them and could help reduce the risk of pregnancy in future HIV prevention trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591383>Progranulin attenuates liver fibrosis by downregulating the inflammatory response.</a></h2><p>Progranulin (PGRN) is a cysteine-rich secreted protein expressed in endothelial cells, immune cells, neurons, and adipocytes. It was first identified for its growth factor-like properties, being implicated in tissue remodeling, development, inflammation, and protein homeostasis. However, these findings are controversial, and the role of PGRN in liver disease remains unknown. In the current study, we examined the effect of PGRN in two different models of chronic liver disease, methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCD)-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis. To induce long-term expression of PGRN, PGRN-expressing adenovirus was delivered via injection into the tibialis anterior. In the CCl4-induced fibrosis model, PGRN showed protective effects against hepatic injury, inflammation, and fibrosis via inhibition of nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation. PGRN also decreased lipid accumulation and inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production and fibrosis in the MCD-induced  model. In vitro treatment of primary macrophages and Raw 264.7 cells with conditioned media from hepatocytes pre-treated with PGRN prior to stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or palmitate decreased their expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, PGRN suppressed inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression in a cell culture model of hepatocyte injury and primary stellate cell activation. These observations increase our understanding of the role of PGRN in liver injury and suggest PGRN delivery as a potential therapeutic strategy in chronic inflammatory liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586364>Using Wearable Physiological Monitors With Suicidal Adolescent Inpatients: Feasibility and Acceptability Study.</a></h2><p>Wearable physiological monitoring devices enable the continuous measurement of human behavior and psychophysiology in the real world. Although such monitors are promising, their availability does not guarantee that participants will continuously wear and interact with them, especially during times of psychological distress.This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using a wearable behavioral and physiological monitor, the Empatica E4, to continuously assess a group of suicidal adolescent inpatients.Participants (n=50 adolescent inpatients) were asked to wear an Empatica E4 on their wrist for the duration of their inpatient stay. In addition to assessing behavioral metadata (eg, hours worn per day), we also used qualitative interviews and self-report measures to assess participants' experience of wearing the monitor.Results supported the feasibility and acceptability of this approach. Participants wore the monitor for an average of 18 hours a day and reported that despite sometimes finding the monitor uncomfortable, they did not mind wearing it. Many of the participants noted that the part of the study they enjoyed most was contributing to scientific understanding, especially if it could help people similar to them in the future.These findings provide promising support for using wearable monitors in clinical samples in future studies, especially if participants are invested in being part of a research study.©Evan Kleiman, Alexander J Millner, Victoria W Joyce, Carol C , Ralph J Buonopane, Matthew K Nock.

The majority of these are in non-coding regions, and are commonly assigned to the nearest gene along the genome. However, this approach neglects the three-dimensional organisation of the genome, and the fact that the genome contains arrays of extremely conserved non-coding elements termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), which can be utilized to detect genes under long-range developmental regulation. Here we review a GRB-based approach to assign loci in non-coding regions to potential target genes, and apply it to reanalyse the results of one of the largest schizophrenia GWAS (SWG PGC, 2014). We further apply this approach to GWAS data from two related neuropsychiatric disorders-autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder-to show that it is applicable to developmental disorders in general. We find that disease-associated SNPs are overrepresented in GRBs and that the GRB model is a powerful tool for linking these SNPs to their correct target genes under long-range regulation. Our analysis identifies novel genes not previously implicated in schizophrenia and corroborates a number of predicted targets from the original study. The results are available as an online resource in which the genomic context and the strength of enhancer-promoter associations can be browsed for each schizophrenia-associated SNP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645988>Relationship between  expressing Cnm in the oral cavity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is a severe state of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is pathologically characterised by steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and lobular inflammation.

The Gore® Acuseal graft is an early-cannulation graft, needled before incorporation and thus may be especially prone to pseudoaneurysm formation. In addition, as this is a relatively new product, there are limited data on long-term outcomes such as pseudoaneurysm. We report one center's experience of the incidence, and etiological factors associated with pseudoaneurysm formation over 5 years and 265 grafts.265 Acuseal grafts were placed in the last 5 years. All patients had prospective data entered into an electronic searchable patient record. Surveillance was performed with 3 monthly imaging (DSA or ultrasound), clinical examination and hemodynamic performance. Data examined included the incidence, causative factors and outcomes for pseudoaneurysm.11 grafts (4.15%) developed a pseudoaneurysm, with 2 patients developing significant hemorrhage. The median time to development of a pseudoaneurysm was 25 months (IQR 20-28 months). Several common etiological factors were identified. All but one patient had over-use of needling sites (n=10; 90.9%). Other factors associated with pseudoaneurysm formation were inadequate surveillance (n=9; 81.8%); venous outflow stenosis (n=9; 81.8%) and anticoagulation/dual antiplatelet therapy (n=7; 63.6%). Management included observation and needle rotation (n=5, 45.5%); stent-grafting (n=3; 27.3%), or excision (n=1; 9.1%) of the pseudoaneurysm. Surgical or endovascular augmentation of the venous outflow was required in 9 patients (81.8%). Graft ligation and explantation was required in 5 patients (45.5%) with graft preservation achieved in 6/11 patients (54.5%).Pseudoaneurysm formation occurs less frequently in Acuseal grafts compared with historical data for standard PTFE grafts. Pseudoaneurysm formation did not occur in any graft within the first 13 months following implantation; suggesting early-cannulation prior to incorporation is not in itself a risk factor for pseudoaneurysm development. Poor needling, venous stenosis, inadequate surveillance and anticoagulation/dual antiplatelet therapy are remediable factors, and graft preservation is possible. Acuseal is a robust graft with lower rates of pseudoaneurysm formation on long-term follow up than standard PTFE grafts.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Success in these rivalries requires that individuals choose dynamically and unpredictably, often adopting a mixed strategy. Understanding the neural basis of strategic decision making is complicated by the fact that it recruits various cognitive processes that are often shared with non-strategic forms of decision making, such as value estimation, working memory, response inhibition, response selection, and reward processes. Although researchers have explored neural activity within key brain regions during mixed-strategy games, how brain activity differs in the context of strategic interactions versus non-strategic choices is not well understood. We developed a novel behavioral paradigm to dissociate choice behavior during mixed-strategy interactions from non-strategic choices, and we used task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to contrast brain activation. In a block design, participants competed in the classic mixed-strategy game, "matching pennies," against a dynamic computer opponent designed to exploit predictability in players' response patterns. Results were contrasted with a non-strategic task that had comparable sensory input, motor output, and reward rate; thus, differences in behavior and brain activation reflect strategic processes. The mixed-strategy game was associated with activation of a distributed cortico-striatal network compared to the non-strategic task. We propose that choosing in mixed-strategy contexts requires additional cognitive demands present to a lesser degree during the control task, illustrating the strength of this design in probing function of cognitive systems beyond core sensory, motor, and reward processes.© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589678>Understanding the Fertilizer Management Impacts on Water and Nitrogen Dynamics for a Corn Silage Tile-Drained System in Canada.</a></h2><p>Effective management of dairy manure is important to minimize N losses from cropping systems, maximize profitability, and enhance environmental sustainability. The objectives of this study were (i) to calibrate and validate the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model using measurements of silage corn ( L.) biomass, N uptake, soil temperature, tile drain flow, NO leaching, NO emissions, and soil mineral N in eastern Canada, and (ii) to investigate the long-term impacts of manure management under climate variability. The treatments investigated included a zero-fertilizer control, inorganic fertilizer, and dairy manure amendments (raw and digested). The DNDC model overall demonstrated statistically "good" performance when simulating silage corn yield and N uptake based on normalized RMSE (nRMSE) < 10%, index of agreement () > 0.9, and -Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) > 0.5. In addition, DNDC, with its inclusion of a tile drainage mechanism, demonstrated "good" predictions for cumulative drainage (nRMSE < 20%, > 0.8, and NSE > 0.5). The model did, however, underestimate daily drainage flux during spring thaw for both organic and inorganic amendments. This was attributed to an underestimation of soil temperature and soil water under frequent soil freezing and thawing during the 2013-2014 overwinter period. Long-term simulations under climate variability indicated that spring applied manure resulted in less NO leaching and NO emissions than fall application when manure rates were managed based on crop N requirements. Overall, this study helped highlight the challenges in discerning the short-term climate interactions on fertilizer-induced N losses compared with the long-term dynamics under climate variability.© 2019 The Author(s) and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589122>Natural aldose reductase inhibitor: A potential therapeutic agent for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Aldose reductase (AR) has been reported to be involved in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Hepatic AR is induced under hyperglycemia condition and converts excess glucose to lipogenic fructose, which contributes in part to the accumulation of fat in the liver cells of diabetes rodents. In addition, the hyperglycemia-induced AR or nutrition-induced AR causes suppression of the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and reduced lipolysis in the liver, which also contribute to the development of NAFLD. Moreover, AR induction in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () may aggravate oxidative stress and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the liver. Here, we summarize the knowledge on AR inhibitors of plant origin and review the effect of some plant-derived AR inhibitors on NAFLD/ in rodents. Natural AR inhibitors may improve NAFLD at least in part through attenuating oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine expression. Some of the natural AR inhibitors have been reported to attenuate hepatic steatosis through the regulation of PPARα-mediated fatty acid oxidation. In this review, we propose that the natural AR inhibitors are potential therapeutic agents for NAFLD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604692>Performance of Plasma Biomarkers and Diagnostic Panels for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis and Advanced Fibrosis in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>The 2019  suggested that patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) should be evaluated for liver fibrosis.

Of note, none of the panels or biomarkers was able to outperform plasma ALT (AUC 0.78 [95% CI 0.71-0.84]). Performance was better to diagnose advanced fibrosis, in which plasma PRO-C3, AST, and APRI showed better results than the other approaches (AUC 0.90 [0.85-0.95]; 0.85 [0.80-0.91]; and 0.86 [0.80-0.91]; respectively). Again, none of the approaches did significantly better than plasma AST. Sequential use of plasma AST and other noninvasive tests may help in limiting the number of liver biopsies required to detect patients with advanced fibrosis.Performance of noninvasive clinical models/scores and plasma biomarkers for the diagnosis of  or advanced fibrosis was suboptimal in patients with T2DM.

Treatment is largely based on lifestyle modification, which is difficult to achieve in most patients. Progression of simple fatty liver or steatosis to its severe form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and liver fibrosis has been explained by a 'two-hit hypothesis'. Whilst simple steatosis is considered the first hit, its transformation to  may be driven by a second hit. Of several factors that constitute the second hit, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are formed when reducing-sugars react with proteins or lipids, have been implicated as major candidates that drive steatosis to  via the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). Both endogenous and processed food-derived (exogenous) AGEs can activate RAGE, mainly present on Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, thus propagating NAFLD progression. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of NAFLD with special emphasis on the role of food-derived AGEs in NAFLD progression to  and liver fibrosis. Moreover, the effect of dietary manipulation to reduce AGE content in food or the therapies targeting AGE/RAGE pathway on disease progression is also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612792>Discovery of potent apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 inhibitors via integrated computational strategy and biological evaluation.</a></h2><p>Apoptosis signal-regulating Kinase 1 (ASK1) has been confirmed as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () disorder and the discovery of ASK1 inhibitors has attracted increasing attention.

The water balance model (WBM) uses standard meteorological parameters as input variables and runs on a daily time step. It consists of two modules. The aboveground module (1) comprises routines for fog precipitation generation, precipitation interception and snowfall/snowmelt dynamics. Covered belowground processes (2) are bypass flow, percolation, soil evaporation and transpiration, where the latter two processes are considered separately. Preceding to the WBM, a routine is introduced, specifying the intra-annual foliage dynamics of beech. Emphasis is also laid on the inter-annual variation of beech phenology. Leaf sprouting and leaf senescence are calculated as functions of day-length and air temperature. The WBM was applied to four European beech dominated forest stands in the northeastern part of Austria. They are located on a gradient of declining annual precipitation (from west to east). The two easterly sites are located close to the (dry) limit of the natural distribution of beech. Records of soil moisture were used for the adjustment of 26 parameters. On all sites the calibration process (simulated annealing) delivered good predictions of soil moisture (-Sutcliffe efficiency≥ 0.925). Then, the obtained parameterization was used to apply different scenarios of global warming. The temperature was increased step-wisely up to 4 °C. All scenarios were run (1) with present phenological conditions and (2) with phenology responding to higher temperatures. This way, we wanted to assign the effect of higher temperatures and longer growing seasons on the water dynamics of the forest stands. A warming of 1 °C corresponded roughly to an elongation of the growing season of 4.5 days, where the start of the growing season was affected more strongly than the end. Apparently, higher temperatures led to drier soils. The strongest change was observed in early summer, also amplified by an earlier start of the growing season. Rising temperatures led to lower export fluxes of liquid water, simultaneously increasing evapotranspiration (ET). The gain in ET was almost entirely assignable to increased soil evaporation. Drier soils led to a sharp depression of transpiration during summer months. This decline was compensated by the effect of elongated growing seasons. The risk of severe drought was increased by higher temperatures, but here the contribution of growing season length was negligible. Drier soils seem to hamper the stands' productivity. For all warming scenarios, the estimated increase of the gross primary production, caused by longer periods of assimilation, is nullified by the effect of soil water deficit in mid-summer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661783>A Lipidomic Analysis of Docosahexaenoic Acid (22:6, ω3) Mediated Attenuation of Western Diet Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Male  Mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem worldwide. NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced . We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced  and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of . This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins.  markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026).

Complications have been reported during hardware removal, including not knowing the exact implant prior to its removal. If a patient presents for plate removal to a surgeon who did not perform the initial fracture fixation, having a preoperative visual aid can help the treating surgeon choose the right instruments for their removal.  To identify many of the available distal radius fixation devices, we searched the Internet and contacted local industry representatives. We also approached industry personnel at the commercial exhibit of a national hand society meeting to provide us with implants they manufacture. The implants were placed on the volar and dorsal aspects of sawbone models of the distal radius and in one case the radial styloid, using the screws, screwdrivers and accessories in the standard implant set and then posteroanterior and lateral x-rays of the implants were obtained. We created an atlas and a list of the screwdriver(s) used for each.  We obtained radiographs and photographs for 28 implants that were manufactured by 14 different companies. Two companies sent us radiographs and photographs placed on either a sawbone or cadaveric model. We found that 7 of the implants were outliers and could be identified easily on the x-rays, whereas 21 implants had similar design of shaft and distal components.  To aid the orthopedic surgeon in their removal, we compiled a comprehensive list of most distal radius fixation devices on the market including plates and their corresponding screws and screwdrivers.

We report herein that YAP in Kupffer cells (KCs) enhances the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Our data show that the expression of YAP is significantly increased in KCs of wild type mice fed HFD. We then generated mice with macrophage/monocyte-specific deletion of YAP (YAP ) or TLR4 (TLR4 ) and the animals were fed high fat diet (HFD) or treated with LPS. Our data showed that YAP mice fed HFD exhibited lower serum ALT/AST levels and less hepatic inflammation when compared to their littermate controls. LPS treatment induced the accumulation of YAP in KCs in vitro and in mice which was prevented by macrophage/monocyte-specific deletion of TLR4 (TLR4 ). LPS transcriptionally activates YAP via AP-1 in macrophages/KCs. The LPS-induced YAP further enhances the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6) through YAP association with the TEAD-binding motif in the promoter region of inflammatory cytokines. Forced overexpression of active YAP (YAP5SA) in KCs enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment of HFD-fed mice with verteporfin inhibited Kupffer cell activation, reduced liver inflammation and decreased serum ALT/AST levels. Analyses of liver tissues from  patients reveal that YAP is increased in KCs and that the level of YAP in human liver tissues is positively correlated with the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: This study describes an important role of YAP in Kupffer cells for regulation of liver inflammation in .

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of steatosis and steatohepatitis among livers from adults who died due to non-burn trauma.Specimens were collected from 224 adults undergoing autopsy at a regional autopsy referral center from September 2011 to April 2013. Histopathological examination was performed on six samples obtained from different lobes of each liver. The outcomes of interest were the presence of steatosis, steatohepatitis,  inflammation and  fibrosis. The main predictors were body mass index, abdominal circumference, liver weight and volume, presence of cholelithiasis, and siderosis. Our modeling strategy made use of a series of generalized linear models with a binomial family.Our sample had a mean age of 40 years; steatosis was diagnosed in 48.2% of cases, and steatohepatitis was diagnosed in 2.7%. The presence of a high proportion of fatty changes was more prevalent among males and older individuals, with the most affected age group being 41-60 years. When evaluating the crude odds ratio for steatosis, the factors significantly associated with an increased risk of steatosis were greater abdominal circumference, BMI, and liver weight and the presence of siderosis.Our study reinforces the role of older age, obesity and hepatomegaly as predictors of fatty liver disease. These variables should be considered in the assessment of fatty changes in the livers of potential liver donors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600750>Rodent Models of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a continuous diseases spectrum associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. Simple hepatic steatosis may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), even fibrosis and cirrhosis, and finally hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, NAFLD has become a public health concern with increasing prevalence. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis remain incompletely understood, and few effective therapeutic approaches are available. Summary and Key Messages: A myriad of different rodent models has been developed to elucidate pathophysiology of NAFLD/ and guide therapeutic strategy. To date, no single rodent model can display the whole disease spectrum and metabolic features associated with human , but can imitate particular characteristics. In this paper, we review the most commonly used dietary, genetic, and chemical rodent models for NAFLD referring to their advantages and disadvantages. Also, we illustrate the status of latest treatment strategy using various NAFLD rodent models. We hope to provide critical guidance for researchers to select appropriate animal models.© 2019 S.

The combination of liver disease and renal dysfunction can occur as a result of systemic conditions that affect both the liver and the kidney, although primary disorders of the liver complicated by renal dysfunction are much more common. As most of the renal dysfunction scenarios in cirrhotic patients correspond to either prerenal azotemia or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), physicians tend to conceive renal dysfunction in cirrhotic patients as mainly HRS. However, there are many systemic conditions that may cause both a "baseline" chronic kidney damage and a superimposed kidney dysfunction when this systemic condition worsens. The main aim of this article is to review some of the most important non prerenal non-HRS considerations regarding acute on chronic kidney dysfunction in cirrhotic patients, including renal manifestation of related to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () viral hepatitis, the effect of cardiorenal syndrome in cirrhotics and corticosteroid-deficiency associated renal dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Fundación Clínica Médica Sur, A.C.

Since high glucose levels are as toxic as lipids for hepatic metabolism, we hypothesize that altered response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to more severe NAFLD with significant/advanced liver damage.We studied 90 subjects with morbid obesity (73F/17M, BMI = 43.2 ± 5,9 kg/m) undergoing bariatric surgery and intraoperative liver biopsy, and measured HbA1c, HOMA-IR (fasting Glucose x Insulin/22.5), OGTT glucose and insulin profile, and calculated OGIS (muscle insulin sensitivity), hepatic-IR (glucose [AUC] x insulin [AUC]) during OGTT, insulin response as (insulin [dAUC]/glucose [dAUC] or Insulinogenic Index (IGI = (I-I)/(G-G)). Patients were divided in 3 groups according to liver biopsy: A (no-NAFLD, 23%), B (simple steatosis (SS), 53%) and C (, 24%) with similar age, gender and BMI. Diabetes was 0% in no-NAFLD, 13% in SS, 35% in . During OGTT, OGIS decreased from A to C (422 vs 360 vs 338, p < 0.01). Increased insulin concentrations, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and OGIS, not Hep-IR, were strongly associated to hepatic steatosis (p = 0.03, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 respectively). Hepatic fibrosis stage was mild as most of the patients had fibrosis grade-1 (69% vs. 8% no fibrosis) and associated to fasting insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR. dAUC-I/dAUC-G was similar in the 3 groups, while only AUC-I was strongly associated to steatosis (r = 0.35, p = 0.005), but not to fibrosis.In morbid obesity indexes of IR, and not of insulin response, are markers of histological severity of liver disease.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether epigenetics and environmental factors interact to promote progressive NAFLD during IR. We examined the miRNA signature in insulin receptor haploinsufficient (InsR+/-) and wild-type (wt) HSCs by RNAseq ( = 4 per group). Then, we evaluated their impact in an IR- (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) model (InsR+/- mice fed standard or methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet,  = 10 per group) and in vitro. InsR+/- HSCs displayed 36 differentially expressed miRNAs ( < 0.05 vs. wt), whose expression was then analyzed in the liver of InsR+/- mice fed an MCD diet. We found that miR-101-3p negatively associated with both InsR+/- genotype and MCD ( < 0.05) and the histological spectrum of liver damage ( < 0.01). miR-101-3p was reduced in InsR+/- hepatocytes and HSCs and even more in InsR+/- cells exposed to insulin (0.33 µM) and fatty acids (0.25 mM), resembling the IR- model. Conversely, insulin induced miR-101-3p expression in wt cells but not in InsR+/- ones ( < 0.05). In conclusion, IR combined with diet-induced liver injury favors miR-101-3p downregulation, which may promote progressive NAFLD through HSC and hepatocyte transdifferentiation and proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636579>Corrigendum: Toward a unifying taxonomy and definition for meditation.</a></h2><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00806.].Copyright © 2019 , Newberg and Awasthi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591597>A rectal cancer organoid platform to study individual responses to chemoradiation.</a></h2><p>Rectal cancer (RC) is a challenging disease to treat that requires chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to optimize outcomes for individual patients.

Whether functional status affects LT outcomes equally across cirrhosis etiologies is unclear.We evaluate the impact of functional status on waitlist and post-LT mortality stratified by etiology and age.Functional status among US adults from 2005 to 2017 United Network for Organ Sharing LT registry data was retrospectively evaluated using Karnofsky Performance Status Score (KPS-1 = functional status 80-100%, KPS-2 = 60-70%, KPS-3 = 40-50%, KPS-4 = 10-30%). Waitlist and post-LT survival were stratified by KPS and cirrhosis etiology, including alcoholic liver disease (ALD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), hepatitis C (HCV), and HCV/ALD, and evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models.Among 94,201 waitlist registrants (69.4% men, 39.5% HCV, 26.7% ALD, 23.2% ), ALD patients had worse functional status compared to HCV (KPS-4: 17.2% vs. 8.3%, p < 0.001). Worse functional status at time of waitlist registration was associated with higher 90-day waitlist mortality with the greatest effect in ALD (KPS-4 vs. KPS-1: ALD HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.83-2.55; HCV HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.87-2.51). Similar trends occurred in 5-year post-LT survival with ALD patients the most harmed. Compared to patients < 50 years, patients ≥ 65 years had increased waitlist mortality at 90-days if they had HCV or HCV/ALD, and 5-year post-LT mortality regardless of cirrhosis etiology with ALD patients most severely affected.In a retrospective cohort study of patients, US ALD patients had disparately worse functional status at time of LT waitlist registration.

The first step of the spectrum of the disease is the non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL). Based on hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation, NAFL will progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), which may have the potential to progress cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a few years. Kupffer cells (KCs) are liver-resident macrophages and have been proven to play a crucial role in NAFLD development. Cardiolipin is reported to be effective to trigger the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through a ROS-independent signaling pathway. However, the exact mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activated by cardiolipin in KCs is still unclear.To make clear of the specific mechanism mentioned above, we firstly used a MCD-induced  mice model to demonstrate that CLS1 suppression reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Secondly, the results of IHC staining indicated that the expressions of CLS1 and NLRP3 in liver tissues were significantly upregulated in the  group compared to the ND group. On the contrary, CLS1 inhibition significantly downregulated NLRP3 expression in liver tissues, which indicated that CLS1 probably regulated the level of NLRP3 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CLS1 suppression significantly ameliorated the liver function and decreased the TG level, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 were markedly reduced upon CLS1 inhibition.In this work, we reported that cardiolipin is involved in the development of , and the suppression of the cardiolipin synthesis by shRNA-CLS1 could ameliorate the hepatic pathogenic manifestations, as well as the serum inflammatory biomarkers. We further showed that the protein expressions of CLS1, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 were all upregulated in the  liver tissues and palmitic stimulated KCs.Our study showed that the upregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activated by cardiolipin is crucial in  pathogenesis, which might provide a novel potential role of cardiolipin blockade in the treatment of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672448>Effects of newer antidiabetic drugs on nonalcoholic fatty liver and steatohepatitis: Think out of the box!</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western societies and a major cause of hepatic disease worldwide.

After baseline surveys demonstrated that Sudan was endemic for trachoma, the Sudan Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) Trachoma Control Program conducted trachoma prevention and treatment interventions in endemic localities. The Sudan FMOH conducted population-based trachoma prevalence surveys between September 2016 and April 2017 in seven localities across five states of Sudan to document current trachoma prevalence estimates and measure water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) indicators. Children aged 1-9 years were examined for five clinical signs of trachoma, and participants of all ages were examined for trachomatous trichiasis (TT). A household questionnaire was administered to gather demographic and WASH-related information. The prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) in children aged 1-9 years ranged from 0.4% (95% CI: 0.1-1.1%) to 6.4% (95% CI: 3.3-11.9%). Trachomatous trichiasis in those aged 15 years and older ranged from 0.1% (95% CI: 0.0-0.6%) to a high of 4.4% (95% CI: 2.1-9.1%). Of seven localities surveyed, four localities had achieved the elimination threshold of less than 5% TF in children aged 1-9 years.

Ferroptosis is a recently recognized type of cell death characterized by an iron dependent and lipid peroxidation-mediated non-apoptotic cell death. We demonstrate the impact of ferroptosis on the progression of  induced by methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) feeding for 10 days. RSL-3 (a ferroptosis inducer) treatment showed decreased hepatic expression of GPX4, and conversely increased 12/15-lipoxygenase, and apoptosis inducing factor, indicating that ferroptosis plays a key role in -related lipid peroxidation and its-associated cell death. Consistently, levels of serum biochemical, hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and apoptosis in MCD-fed mice were exacerbated with RSL-3 treatment. However, MCD-fed mice treated with sodium selenite (a GPX4 activator) showed increase of hepatic GPX4, accompanied by reduced  severity. To chelate iron, deferoxamine mesylate salt was used. Administration of deferoxamine mesylate salt significantly reduced  severity and abolished the harmful effects of RSL-3 in MCD-fed mice. Finally, treatment with Liproxstatin-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) repressed hepatic lipid peroxidation, and its associated cell death, resulting in decreased  severity. Consistent with the in vivo findings, modulation of ferroptosis /GPX4 affected hepatocellular death in palmitic acid-induced in vitro  milieu.

We studied the effectiveness of a national quality improvement (QI) programme to implement a care pathway to improve survival for these patients.The objectives were to assess whether or not the QI programme improves 90-day survival after emergency abdominal surgery; to assess effects on 180-day survival, hospital stay and hospital readmission; and to better understand these findings through an integrated process evaluation, ethnographic study and cost-effectiveness analysis.This was a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial. Hospitals were organised into 15 geographical clusters, and commenced the QI programme in random order over 85 weeks. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome was analysed using a mixed-effects parametric survival model, adjusting for time-related effects. Ethnographic and economics data were collected in six hospitals. The process evaluation included all hospitals.The trial was set in acute surgical services of 93 NHS hospitals.Patients aged ≥ 40 years who were undergoing emergency abdominal surgery were eligible.The intervention was a QI programme to implement an evidence-based care pathway.The primary outcome measure was mortality within 90 days of surgery. Secondary outcomes were mortality within 180 days, length of hospital stay and hospital readmission within 180 days. The main economic measure was the quality-adjusted life-years.Data were obtained from the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit database; qualitative interviews and ethnographic observations; quality-of-life and NHS resource use data were collected via questionnaires.Of 15,873 eligible patients from 93 NHS hospitals, primary outcome data were analysed for 8482 participants in the usual care group and 7374 in the QI group. The primary outcome occurred in 1393 participants in the usual care group (16%), compared with 1210 patients in the QI group (16%) [QI vs. usual care hazard ratio (HR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.28]. No differences were found in mortality at 180 days or hospital readmission; there was a small increase in hospital stay in the QI group (HR for discharge 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97). There were only modest improvements in care processes following QI implementation. The ethnographic study revealed good QI engagement, but limited time and resources to implement change, affecting which processes teams addressed, the rate of change and eventual success. In some sites, there were challenges around prioritising the intervention in busy environments and in obtaining senior engagement. The intervention is unlikely to be cost-effective at standard cost-effectiveness thresholds, but may be cost-effective over the lifetime horizon.Substantial delays were encountered in securing data access to national registries. Fewer patients than expected underwent surgery and the mortality rate was lower than anticipated.There was no survival benefit from a QI programme to implement a care pathway for patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. The modest impact of the intervention on process measures, despite good clinician engagement, may have been limited by the time and resources needed to improve patient care.Future QI programmes must balance intervention complexity with the practical realities of NHS services to ensure that such programmes can be delivered with the resources available.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN80682973 and  protocol 13PRT/7655.This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services and Delivery Research programme and will be published in full in ; Vol. 7, No. 32.

This study aimed to investigate BA profile alterations in Chinese nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () patients.BA profiles in serum and liver tissues were determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in patients from two different clinical centers.A total of 134 participants were enrolled in this study to serve as the training (n = 87) and validation (n = 47) cohorts. The ratio of circulating conjugated chenodeoxycholic acids to muricholic acids (P = 0.001) was elevated from healthy controls to non- individuals to  individuals in a stepwise manner in the training cohort and was positively associated with the histological severity of : steatosis (R  = 0.12), lobular inflammation (R  = 0.12), ballooning (R  = 0.11), and fibrosis stage (R  = 0.18). The ratio was elevated in the validation cohort of  patients (P < 0.001), and it was able to predict  (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 75%) and significant fibrosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 71%) in these two cohorts. Moreover, this elevated ratio and impaired farnesoid X receptor signaling were found in the  liver.Altered BA profile in  is closely associated with the severity of liver lesions, and it has the potential for predicting  development.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590120>New and emerging anti-fibrotic therapeutics entering or already in clinical trials in chronic liver diseases.</a></h2><p>Chronic liver diseases with different etiologies represent a major public health issue worldwide. Liver fibrosis is the common feature of almost all chronic liver diseases and remains a key determinant of clinical prognosis. Over the last two decades, basic science studies have uncovered molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of chronic liver diseases, leading to the recent development of new anti-fibrotic drugs. These new drugs target different steps in the pathophysiology of chronic liver injury: metabolism of glucose, lipids and bile acids, apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Many targets are shared between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and cholestatic diseases, explaining why some drugs have been assessed concurrently in both conditions. This review reports the most recent clinical trials designed to treat liver fibrosis, with a special focus on  and cholestatic diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on hepatic expression quantitative trait loci analysis it has been suggested that  loss of function promotes liver disease progression, but this has never been formally tested. Here we show that  loss, but not , in mice is sufficient to promote the progression of NAFLD in the setting of high fat diet.  loss of function is associated with accumulation of its substrate lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) lipids, and direct administration of LPI promotes hepatic inflammatory and fibrotic transcriptional changes in an -dependent manner. These studies reveal a novel role for MBOAT7-driven acylation of LPI lipids in suppressing the progression of NAFLD.© 2019, Helsley et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617034>Adipose tissue grafting for management of persistent anastomotic leak after low anterior resection.</a></h2><p>An anastomotic leak is the most dreaded complication after low anterior resection. Adipose tissue grafting may induce healing in a persistent anastomotic defect. The aim of the present study was to report retrospectively reviewed outcomes for a series of patients who were managed with heterotopic grafted adipose tissue to facilitate anastomotic healing.Patients with anastomotic leakage after low anterior resection sequentially treated with grafting of adipose tissue were included in the study. All patients had pelvic radiation during treatment and had a diverting ileostomy in situ. The cohort had a persistent defect despite being treated with available modalities such as suture repair, fibrin glue, Endo-Sponge and surgical debridement. The outcomes were reviewed and reported.There were 11 patients (8 males and 3 females) with a median age of 54 years (range 33-72 years). Five patients experienced complete healing of the anastomotic defect with successful reversal of the diverting ileostomy. The anastomotic defect of one other patient in the series appeared to have healed and hence his diverting ileostomy was reversed. However, he presented with a recurrent leak, which ultimately necessitated an abdominoperineal resection. Another patient had a persistent defect after an attempt at adipose tissue grafting and opted to proceed with a takedown of the anastomosis. In the remaining four patients, the outcome after adipose tissue grafting remains unknown, as two patients succumbed to metastatic disease, one was lost to follow-up and the remaining patient developed a recurrence which required pelvic exenteration. Procedural associated morbidity occurred in one patient who developed fat embolism, which was treated expectantly.Adipose tissue grafting is safe and feasible, though its effectiveness remains uncertain. It may be useful selectively in the management of persistent anastomotic leak after radiation and low anterior resection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689350>Cytomegalovirus antibody responses associated with increased risk of TB disease in Ugandan adults.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence highlights human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and immune activation as risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) disease. It is not known whether other herpes viruses are also implicated, nor if a dose-response relationship exists between TB risk and herpes co-infection.This nested case-control study used stored serum samples from 25 TB cases up to 10 years prior to TB diagnosis and between 3 and 6 matched non-TB controls from a rural Ugandan cohort. Samples were investigated for Epstein Barr (EBV), Herpes Simplex (HSV), and HCMV-specific IgG, serum markers of inflammation, and mycobacterial antibody levels.Humoral response to HCMV, but not EBV or HSV was associated with increased risk of active TB disease up to 10 years prior to diagnosis. Individuals with medium HCMV IgG were 2.8 times more likely to have TB (p=0.055), and those with high HCMV IgG 3.4 times more likely to have TB (p=0.007). Mycobacterial antibody levels were not associated with differences in odds of TB disease. IP-10 was independently associated with increased odds of TB; OR 4.2, p=0.009.These data provide evidence of a dose response between magnitude of HCMV IgG with risk of TB disease. An inflammatory environment, characterized by serum IP-10 and IL1α, are independently associated with increased risk of TB disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

HF is associated with substantial microstructural remodeling, which is linked to changes in left ventricular geometry and impaired cardiac function. The role of myocardial remodeling in altering the mechanics of failing hearts remains unclear. Structurally based constitutive modeling provides an approach to improve understanding of the relationship between biomechanical function and tissue organization in cardiac muscle during HF. In this study, we used cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and extended-volume confocal microscopy to quantify the remodeling of left ventricular geometry and myocardial microstructure of healthy and spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts at the ages of 12 and 24 months. Passive cardiac mechanical function was characterized using left ventricular pressure-volume compliance measurements. We have developed a, to our knowledge, new structurally based biomechanical constitutive equation built on parameters quantified directly from collagen distributions observed in confocal images of the myocardium. Three-dimensional left ventricular finite element models were constructed from subject-specific in vivo magnetic resonance imaging data. The structurally based constitutive equation was integrated into geometrically subject-specific finite element models of the hearts and used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of ventricular dysfunction during HF. Using a single pair of material parameters for all hearts, we were able to produce compliance curves that reproduced all of the experimental compliance measurements. The value of this study is not limited to reproducing the mechanical behavior of healthy and diseased hearts, but it also provides important insights into the structure-function relationship of diseased myocardium that will help pave the way toward more effective treatments for HF.Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society.

The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most important enzyme implicated in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism in the liver, is downregulated during NAFLD progression. We have studied the mechanism involved in GNMT downregulation by its repressor microRNA miR-873-5p and the metabolic pathways affected in NAFLD as well as the benefit of recovery GNMT expression.miR-873-5p and GNMT expression were evaluated in liver biopsies of NAFLD/ patients. Different in vitro and in vivo NAFLD murine models were used to assess miR-873-5p/GNMT involvement in fatty liver progression through targeting of the miR-873-5p as NAFLD therapy.We describe a new function of GNMT as an essential regulator of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the liver of NAFLD/ patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly,  therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing fatty acid β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for  treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain. In NAFLD, GNMT is repressed by miR-873-5p and its targeting arises as a valuable therapeutic option for treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox models and pooled across databases by random effect meta-analyses.120 795 patients with recorded NAFLD or  diagnoses were identified with mean follow-up 2.1-5.5 years. After adjustment for age and smoking the pooled hazard ratio for AMI was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.30; 1035 events in participants with NAFLD or , 67 823 in matched controls). In a group with more complete data on risk factors (86 098 NAFLD and 4 664 988 matched controls), the hazard ratio for AMI after adjustment for systolic blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, total cholesterol level, statin use, and hypertension was 1.01 (0.91 to 1.12; 747 events in participants with NAFLD or , 37 462 in matched controls). After adjustment for age and smoking status the pooled hazard ratio for stroke was 1.18 (1.11 to 1.24; 2187 events in participants with NAFLD or , 134 001 in matched controls). In the group with more complete data on risk factors, the hazard ratio for stroke was 1.04 (0.99 to 1.09; 1666 events in participants with NAFLD, 83 882 in matched controls) after further adjustment for type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol level, statin use, and hypertension.The diagnosis of NAFLD in current routine care of 17.7 million patient appears not to be associated with AMI or stroke risk after adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiovascular risk assessment in adults with a diagnosis of NAFLD is important but should be done in the same way as for the general population.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Herein, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of MSDC-0602K in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Patients with biopsy-confirmed  and fibrosis (F1-F3) were randomized to daily oral placebo, or 1 of 3 MSDC-0602K doses in a 52-week double-blind study. The primary efficacy endpoint was hepatic histological improvement of ≥2 points in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) with a ≥1-point reduction in either ballooning or lobular inflammation and no increase in fibrosis stage at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included NAS improvement without worsening fibrosis,  resolution, and fibrosis reduction. Exploratory endpoints included changes in insulin sensitivity, liver injury and liver fibrosis markers.Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 94), or 62.5 mg (n = 99), 125 mg (n = 98), or 250 mg (n = 101) of MSDC-0602K. At baseline, glycated hemoglobin was 6.4 ± 1.0%, 61.5% of patients had fibrosis F2/F3 and the average NAS was 5.3. The primary endpoint was reached in 29.7%, 29.8%, 32.9% and 39.5% of patients in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg dose arms, respectively, with adjusted odds ratios relative to placebo of 0.89 (95% CI 0.44-1.81), 1.22 (95% CI 0.60-2.48), and 1.64 (95% CI 0.83-3.27). The 2 highest doses of MSDC-0602K led to significant reductions in glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin, liver enzymes and NAS compared to placebo. The incidence of hypoglycemia and PPARγ-agonist-associated events such as edema and fractures were similar in the placebo and MSDC-0602K groups.MSDC-0602K did not demonstrate statistically significant effects on primary and secondary liver histology endpoints. However, effects on non-invasive liver cell injury and measures of glucose metabolism support further exploration of MSDC-0602K's safety and potential efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes and liver injury. [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: ].First-generation insulin sensitizers are used to treat type 2 diabetes, but are associated with side effects including edema, bone fractures, and hypoglycemia. MSDC-0602K is a second-generation insulin sensitizer designed to reduce these side effects. We hypothesized that insulin sensitization could improve non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In the current study of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, MSDC-0602K did not demonstrate significant effects on liver histology with the biopsy techniques used. However, useful information was gained for the design of future studies and MSDC-0602K significantly decreased fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and markers of liver injury without dose-limiting side effects.Copyright © 2019.

Dual-photon microscopy allows automated quantification of fibrosis-related parameters (q-FPs) and may facilitate large-scale histological studies. We aim to validate the performance of q-FPs in a large histological cohort.344 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) underwent 428 liver biopsies (240 had paired transient elastography examination). Fibrosis stage was scored using the  Clinical Research Network system, and q-FPs were measured by dual-photon microscopy using unstained slides. Patients were randomly assigned to the training and validation cohorts to test the performance of individual q-FPs and derive optimal cut-offs.Over 25 q-FPs had area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves >0.90 for different fibrosis stages. Among them, the perimeter of collagen fibres and number of long collagen fibres had the highest accuracy. At the best cut-offs, the two q-FPs had 88.3%-96.2% sensitivity and 78.1%-91.1% specificity for different fibrosis stages in the validation cohort. q-FPs and histological scoring had nearly identical correlations with liver stiffness measurement, suggesting that the accuracy of q-FPs approached that of histological assessment. Among patients with paired liver biopsies, changes in the same q-FPs were associated with changes in fibrosis stage. At a median follow-up of 5.6 years, baseline q-FPs predicted liver-related events.q-FP is highly accurate in the assessment of fibrosis in NAFLD patients.

The failure of preclinical approaches to provide significant sepsis survival benefit in the clinic is often attributed to inappropriate animal disease models. It has been demonstrated that high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) blockade can reduce inflammation, mortality and morbidity in experimental sepsis without promoting immunosuppression. Within this study, we explored the use of ovine anti-HMGB1 antibodies in a model of ovine septic shock incorporating intensive care supports (OSSICS). Results: Septic sheep exhibited elevated levels of HMGB1 within 12 h after the induction of sepsis. In this study, sepsis was induced in six anaesthetized adult Border Leicester × Merino ewes via intravenous instillation of  and sheep monitored according to intensive care unit standard protocols for 26 h, with the requirement for noradrenaline as the primary endpoint. Septic sheep exhibited a hyperdynamic circulation, renal dysfunction, deranged coagulation profile and severe metabolic acidosis. Sheep were assigned a severity of illness score, which increased over time. While a therapeutic effect of intravenous anti-HMGB1 antibody could not be observed in this model due to limited animal numbers, a reduced bacterial dose induced a septic syndrome of much lower severity. With modifications including a reduced bacterial dose, a longer timeframe and broad spectrum antibiotics, the OSSICS model may become a robust tool for preclinical assessment of sepsis therapeutics.Copyright: © Stevens et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680767>Efficacy of evogliptin and cenicriviroc against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice: a comparative study.</a></h2><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, or gliptins, are a class of oral hypoglycemic drugs that have been widely used as a second-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Gliptins, which were introduced for clinical use a decade ago, have been shown to be beneficial against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () in animals and humans. Cenicriviroc (CVC), a dual antagonist of C-C chemokine receptor type 2 and 5, is currently under investigation against  and fibrosis. It was previously discovered that evogliptin (EVO) reduces hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese animals but the effectiveness of EVO on  remains unexplored. Here, we compared the effectiveness of EVO and CVC against  and fibrosis in mice fed a high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFHF). Biochemical and histological analyses showed that mice fed a HFHF for 20 weeks developed severe hepatic steatosis and inflammation with mild fibrosis. Administration of EVO (0.2% wt/wt) for the last 8 weeks of HFHF feeding significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis as well as restored insulin sensitivity, as evidenced by lowered plasma insulin levels and the improvement in insulin tolerance test curves. Treatment of mice with CVC (0.1% wt/wt) inhibited hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis with similar efficacy to that of EVO, without affecting hepatic steatosis. CVC treatment also reduced plasma insulin concentrations, despite no improvement in insulin tolerance. In conclusion, EVO administration efficiently ameliorated the development of  and fibrosis in HFHF-fed mice, corroborating its therapeutic potential.Copyright © 2019 The Korean Physiological Society and The Korean Society of Pharmacology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650383>High fructose-containing drinking water-induced steatohepatitis in rats is prevented by the nicotinamide-mediated modulation of redox homeostasis and NADPH-producing enzymes.</a></h2><p>An imbalance in the redox state, increased levels of lipid precursors and overactivation of de novo lipogenesis determine the development of fibrosis during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().

Male rats were provided drinking water containing 40% fructose for 16 weeks. During the last 12 weeks of fructose administration, water containing NAM was provided to some of the rats for 5 h/day. The biochemical profiles and the ghrelin, leptin, lipoperoxidation and TNF-α levels in serum and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), malic enzyme (ME) and NADP-dependent isocitric dehydrogenase (IDP) levels, the reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and reduced/oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H/NAD(P)) ratios, and the levels of various lipogenic and fibrotic markers in the liver were evaluated. The results showed that hepatic fibrosis induced by fructose consumption was associated with weight gain, hunger-satiety system dysregulation, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, lipoperoxidation and inflammation. Moreover, increased levels of hepatic G6PD and ME activity and expression, the NAD(P)H/NAD(P) ratios, and GSSG concentration and increased expression of lipogenic and fibrotic markers were detected, and these alterations were attenuated by NAM administration. Specifically, NAM diminished the activity and expression of G6PD and ME, and this effect was associated with a decrease in the NADPH/NADP ratios, increased GSH levels and decreased lipoperoxidation and inflammation, ameliorating fibrosis and  development.

Humans are exposed to increased amounts of light in the blue spectrum produced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which can interfere with normal sleep cycles. The LED technologies are relatively new; therefore, the long-term effects of exposure to blue light across the lifespan are not understood. We investigated the effects of light in the model organism, , and determined that flies maintained in daily cycles of 12-h blue LED and 12-h darkness had significantly reduced longevity compared with flies maintained in constant darkness or in white light with blue wavelengths blocked. Exposure of adult flies to 12 h of blue light per day accelerated aging phenotypes causing damage to retinal cells, brain neurodegeneration, and impaired locomotion. We report that brain damage and locomotor impairments do not depend on the degeneration in the retina, as these phenotypes were evident under blue light in flies with genetically ablated eyes. Blue light induces expression of stress-responsive genes in old flies but not in young, suggesting that cumulative light exposure acts as a stressor during aging. We also determined that several known blue-light-sensitive proteins are not acting in pathways mediating detrimental light effects. Our study reveals the unexpected effects of blue light on fly brain and establishes  as a model in which to investigate long-term effects of blue light at the cellular and organismal level.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614259>Insights from using in-situ ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy to assess nitrogen treatment and subsurface dynamics in a regenerative stormwater conveyance (RSC) system.</a></h2><p>Regenerative stormwater conveyance (RSC) is a recently developed stormwater control measure that marries the concepts of bioretention and stream restoration.

This research used Multi-Point Sampling coupled with in-situ ultraviolet-visual spectroscopy to measure nitrogen in seepage during simulated storm events (n = 9) at a field-scale RSC in Raleigh, North Carolina. Calibrations between light absorbance and concentrations were acceptable (-Sutcliffe coefficient > 0.65) for nitrate and total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) and very good (-Sutcliffe coefficient > 0.90) for total Kjehdahl nitrogen (TKN). Early storm simulations revealed some initial nutrient flushing from the substrate, which subsided by the third simulation. Overall, subsurface seepage nitrate, TAN, and TKN concentrations were lower by 29%, 57%, and 4% relative to storm inflow concentrations, respectively. Computed subsurface nitrogen concentrations demonstrated temporal variability, highlighting dynamic transport and biogeochemical transformations in saturated and unsaturated conditions. Nitrogen concentrations were lower in seepage than in surface flow; however, due to the high volume of runoff converted to seepage, nitrogen loads discharged in seepage can be larger than those of surface flow. Further research is needed to examine subsurface pollutant reductions under varying hydrologic and seasonal conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent government programmes such as the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and Mission Indradhanush (MI) have catalysed important changes impacting VHNDs. To learn how VHNDs are currently being delivered, we assessed the fidelity of services provided as compared to government norms in a priority district of Uttar Pradesh.We fielded a cross-sectional study of VHNDs to provide a snapshot of health services functioning. Process evaluation data were collected via administrative sources, non-participant observation using a standardised form, and structured questionnaires. Questionnaires were designed using a framework to assess implementation fidelity. Key respondents were VHND participants, front-line workers involved in VHND delivery, and VHND non-participants (pregnant women due for antenatal care or children due for vaccination as per administrative records). Results were summarised as counts, frequencies, and proportions.In the 30 villages randomly selected for inclusion, 36 VHNDs were scheduled but four (11.1%) were cancelled and one VHND was not surveyed. Vaccination and antenatal care were offered at 96.8% (30/31) and child weighing at 83.9% (26/31) of VHNDs. Other normed services were infrequently provided or completely absent. Health education and promotion were particularly weak; institutional delivery was the only topic discussed in a majority of VHNDs. The true proportion of any serious problem impeding vaccine delivery was 47.2% (17/36), comprising 4 VHND cancellations and 13 VHNDs experiencing vaccine shortages. Of the 13 incidents of vaccine shortage, 11 related to an unexpected global shortage of injectable polio vaccine (IPV). Over the 31 VHNDs, 37.8% (171 of the 452 scheduled beneficiaries) did not participate. Analysis of missed opportunities for vaccination highlighted inaccuracies in beneficiary identification and tracking and demand side-factors.The transformative potential of VHNDs to improve population health is only partially being met. A core subset of high-priority services for antenatal care, institutional delivery, and vaccination associated with high-priority government programmes (JSY, MI) is now being provided quite successfully. Other basic health promotion and prevention services are largely not provided, constituting a critical missed opportunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574071>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Silent Epidemic.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a growing condition among adolescent and adult populations, present in around 20%-30% of people in the United Kingdom. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is known as a silent disease and over many years may go on to cause nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In the future it may become a leading contributor to cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and mortality. In recent years, programs have been set up to raise awareness of this condition with the first International  (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) Day taking place in 2018; nevertheless, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is still not clearly understood by many. An extensive review has shown a lack of nursing literature on this topic, and effective specialist nurse input for this patient group should be a key component in tackling this growing epidemic in the years to come.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654279>Population-Level Resistance to Chytridiomycosis is Life-Stage Dependent in an Imperiled Anuran.</a></h2><p>Amphibian declines caused by chytridiomycosis have been severe, but some susceptible populations have persisted or even recovered. Resistance to the causal agent Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) could result from alleles of the adaptive immune system. During metamorphosis, however, immune systems may not be fully functional, implying that an effective immune response to Bd may be life-stage dependent. We evaluated the susceptibility of the relict leopard frog (Rana onca) sourced from two areas where Bd was present or absent, and where the populations appeared to show differences in pathogen resistance. We evaluated whether population-level resistance manifested across life stages using challenge experiments with late-stage tadpoles (Gosner stage 31-38), metamorphs (stage 45-46), and juvenile frogs. We used three different Bd isolates including one from wild R. onca to challenge juvenile frogs and focused on the isolate from R. onca to challenge tadpoles and resulting metamorphs. We found that juveniles from the Bd exposed population were 5.5 times more likely to survive Bd infection and 10 times more likely to clear infections than those from the area without Bd. In contrast, and regardless of the source area, we observed 98% survivorship of tadpoles, but only 19% survivorship of resulting metamorphs following re-exposure. Given the low survivorship of exposed metamorphs in the laboratory, we speculate on how resistance characteristics, whether adaptive or innate, that do not manifest at each life stage could develop in the wild. We suggest that seasonal high temperatures during times when metamorphosis appears common may modulate the effects of the pathogen during this most susceptible life stage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561285>Inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 ameliorates renal injury in a novel medaka model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related kidney disease.</a></h2><p>The effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2I) on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () has been reported, but there are few studies on its effect on -related renal injury.

People gain nutrients from a varied diet, although fish-which are a rich source of bioavailable micronutrients that are essential to human health-are often overlooked. A lack of understanding of the nutrient composition of most fish and how nutrient yields vary among fisheries has hindered the policy shifts that are needed to effectively harness the potential of fisheries for food and nutrition security. Here, using the concentration of 7 nutrients in more than 350 species of marine fish, we estimate how environmental and ecological traits predict nutrient content of marine finfish species. We use this predictive model to quantify the global spatial patterns of the concentrations of nutrients in marine fisheries and compare nutrient yields to the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in human populations. We find that species from tropical thermal regimes contain higher concentrations of calcium, iron and zinc; smaller species contain higher concentrations of calcium, iron and omega-3 fatty acids; and species from cold thermal regimes or those with a pelagic feeding pathway contain higher concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids. There is no relationship between nutrient concentrations and total fishery yield, highlighting that the nutrient quality of a fishery is determined by the species composition. For a number of countries in which nutrient intakes are inadequate, nutrients available in marine finfish catches exceed the dietary requirements for populations that live within 100 km of the coast, and a fraction of current landings could be particularly impactful for children under 5 years of age. Our analyses suggest that fish-based food strategies have the potential to substantially contribute to global food and nutrition security.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638172>The A3 adenosine receptor agonist, namodenoson, ameliorates non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.</a></h2><p>The Wnt/β‑catenin pathway confers a chain of molecular events in livers affected by non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis (). Namodenoson, a selective agonist of the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR), which is highly expressed in pathological liver cells, induces a robust anti‑inflammatory effect in the liver, mediated via the de‑regulation of the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway. Namodenoson also acts as a liver protective agent by inhibiting ischemia/reperfusion injury. Based on these unique characteristics, we investigated the anti‑ effect of Namodenoson in murine models of steatohepatitis and in the LX2 human hepatic stellate cell line (HSC). In the STAM model, Namodenoson significantly decreased the non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score, NAS, demonstrating anti‑inflammatory and anti‑steatotic effects. In the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) model, Namodenoson reversed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to normal values and significantly improved liver inflammation and fibrosis, as well as the adiponectin and leptin levels. Namodenoson de‑regulated the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway in the liver extracts of the CCl4 model mice and in the LX2 HSCs, manifested by a decrease in the expression of phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), nuclear factor κ‑light‑chain‑enhancer of activated B cells (NF‑κB), β‑catenin, lymphoid enhancer‑binding factor 1 (Lef‑1) and cyclin D1, and an increase in the expression level of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK‑3β). The fibrosis marker, α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA) was also de‑regulated, supporting the anti‑fibrotic effect of Namodenoson. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that Namodenoson exerts an anti‑ effect mediated via the de‑regulation of the PI3K/NF‑κB/Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway.

Thirty of 34 SUBNCC patients were treated with extended cysticidal and anti-inflammatory regimens and followed up a median of 4.2 years posttreatment (range: 15 for ≥ 4 years, 20 ≥ 2 years, 26 > 1 year, and 3 < 1 year). The median ages at the time of first symptom, diagnosis, and enrollment were 29.7, 35.6, and 37.9 years, respectively; 58.8% were male and 82.4% were Hispanic. The median time from immigration to symptoms (minimum incubation) was 10 years and the estimated true incubation period considerably greater. Fifty percent also had other forms of NCC. Common complications were hydrocephalus (56%), shunt placement (41%), infarcts (18%), and symptomatic spinal disease (15%). Thirty patients (88.2%) required prolonged treatment with albendazole (88.2%, median 0.55 year) and/or praziquantel (61.8%; median 0.96 year), corticosteroids (88.2%, median 1.09 years), methotrexate (50%, median 1.37 years), and etanercept (34.2%, median 0.81 year), which led to sustained inactive disease in 29/30 (96.7%) patients. Three were treated successfully for recurrences and one has continuing infection. Normalization of cerebral spinal fluid parameters and cestode antigen levels guided treatment decisions. All 15 patients with undetectable cestode antigen values have sustained inactive disease. There were no deaths and moderate morbidity posttreatment. Corticosteroid-related side effects were common, avascular necrosis of joints being the most serious (8/33, 24.2%).

Twenty-four adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups; the control, TQ-treated at the dose 400 mg∕kg b.w., untreated hypothyroidism and TQ-treated hypothyroid groups. Serum levels of thyroid hormones and antioxidant profile were measured. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess gene expression of catalase (CAT). Liver was histopathologically examined using routine and immunohistochemical techniques.Livers of rats with hypothyroidism displayed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the form of steatosis as well as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Moreover, there was an intralobular inflammatory reaction associated with significant (p<0.05) increases in the density of resident hepatic macrophages [cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68)+ cells], as well as in activated hepatic stellate cells, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) index in livers with hypothyroidism. Resolution of hypothyroid NAFLD was observed in livers after treatment with TQ. The significantly increased (p<0.05) steatosis, lobular inflammation, NAFLD activity scores, α-SMA index as well as CD68+ cells induced by hypothyroidism were corrected after TQ administration. Up-regulation of the CAT gene in livers with hypothyroidism after treatment with TQ supported our hypothesis of its antioxidant mechanistic hepatoprotective action.TQ efficiently restores the normal liver histology in hypothyroid rats with up-regulation of the antioxidant CAT gene.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589891>Change in hepatic fat content measured by MRI does not predict treatment-induced histological improvement of steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Proof-of-concept studies frequently assess changes in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content by magnetic resonance-based techniques as a surrogate marker of histology. The aim of this study was to establish how reliable this strategy is to predict changes in liver histology in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().Patients with  who had participated in our prior randomized controlled trials of pioglitazone with complete paired data for IHTG content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liver histology were included in the study.A total of 121 patients were included. Changes in IHTG were assessed in several ways: as a continuous variable (correlations), as categorical groups (IHTG change ≥0%; or IHTG reduction of 1-30%; 31-50%; 51-70%; or >70%), and in a binomial way as steatosis resolution or not (defined as achieving IHTG <5.56%). Changes in IHTG correlated with steatosis on histology (r = 0.54; p <0.01). However, the magnitude of IHTG reduction was not associated with the rate of response of the primary histological outcome (2-point improvement in the NAFLD activity score from 2 different parameters, without worsening of fibrosis) or resolution of  without worsening of fibrosis, neither in patients receiving pioglitazone nor placebo. Changes in lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, or liver fibrosis were also independent of changes in IHTG, irrespective of treatment arm. Steatosis resolution was not associated with better histological outcomes either.Changes in IHTG predict changes in steatosis but not of other liver histological parameters. This implies that IHTG response to treatment should be interpreted with caution, as it may not be as reliable as previously believed to predict a treatment's overall clinical efficacy in patients with .Quantification of liver fat by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used to assess treatment responses in patients with fatty liver, with the assumption that improvements in liver fat translate into less inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis in the liver. However, in this article, we showed that changes in liver fat do not necessarily translate into changes in these parameters. This means that MRI may not be as useful to assess treatment response in patients with fatty liver as previously believed.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers or effective therapeutic options established for NAFLD. Nevertheless, there are several molecular targets in the pipeline, of which fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is one. FGF21 is secreted primarily from liver and has a plethora of metabolic functions. Pre-clinical and epidemiological studies indicate a relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and hepatic fat content in both mice and humans. Moreover, animal studies have clearly shown that aberrant FGF21 signalling is a key pathological step in the development and progression of NAFLD. A recent Phase II clinical trial demonstrated that administration of an FGF21 analogue significantly reduced hepatic fat in subjects with . As such, FGF21 provides a novel target for future biomarker and therapeutic studies. This review appraises preclinical data to outline the current understanding of FGF21 function in both normal hepatic function and NAFLD. Epidemiological evidence is explored to delineate the relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and NAFLD in humans.

We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in NAFLD.Human liver biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by liver fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of liver biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and liver assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total liver cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile acid output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in liver glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/2 as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in liver.These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related metabolic conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

High-fat diet-fed and aged chow-fed liver-specific ASK1-knockout mice develop a higher degree of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis compared to controls. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of ASK1 increased hepatic lipid accumulation in wild-type mice. In line, liver-specific ASK1 overexpression protected mice from the development of high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and carbon tetrachloride-induced fibrosis. Mechanistically, ASK1 depletion blunts autophagy, thereby enhancing lipid droplet accumulation and liver fibrosis. In human livers of lean and obese subjects, ASK1 expression correlated negatively with liver fat content and  scores, but positively with markers for autophagy.

Automated qFIBS analysis outputs showed strong correlation with each respective component of the  CRN scoring (P < 0.001) (qFibrosis [r = 0.776], qInflammation [r = 0.557], qBallooning [r = 0.533], and qSteatosis [r = 0.802]) and high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values (qFibrosis [0.870-0.951; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.787-1.000; P < 0.001], qInflammation [0.820-0.838; 95% CI, 0.726-0.933; P < 0.001 ), qBallooning [0.813-0.844; 95% CI, 0.708-0.957; P < 0.001], and qSteatosis [0.939-0.986; 95% CI, 0.867-1.000; P < 0.001]) and was able to distinguish differing grades/stages of histological disease. Performance of qFIBS was best when assessing degree of steatosis and fibrosis but performed less well when distinguishing severe inflammation and higher ballooning grades. Conclusion: qFIBS is an automated tool that accurately quantifies the critical components of  histological assessment. It offers a tool that could potentially aid reproducibility and standardization of liver biopsy assessments required for  therapeutic clinical trials.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605031>Adaptive immunity: an emerging player in the progression of NAFLD.</a></h2><p>In the past decade, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a leading cause of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, as well as an important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver lesions, including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Although steatosis is often harmless, the lobular inflammation that characterizes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is considered a driving force in the progression of NAFLD. The current view is that innate immune mechanisms represent a key element in supporting hepatic inflammation in . However, increasing evidence points to the role of adaptive immunity as an additional factor promoting liver inflammation. This Review discusses data regarding the role of B cells and T cells in sustaining the progression of  to fibrosis and HCC, along with the findings that antigens originating from oxidative stress act as a trigger for immune responses. We also highlight the mechanisms affecting liver immune tolerance in the setting of steatohepatitis that favour lymphocyte activation. Finally, we analyse emerging evidence concerning the possible application of immune modulating treatments in  therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647570>Between an ocean and a high place: coastal drainage isolation generates endemic cryptic species in the Cape kurper Sandelia capensis (Anabantiformes: Anabantidae), Cape Region, South Africa.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the range-wide phylogenetics and biogeography of the Cape kurper Sandelia capensis, a primary freshwater fish endemic to and widespread within the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa. Maximum likelihood, Bayesian phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses, based on two mitochondrial and two nuclear genes, revealed the existence of three reciprocally monophyletic, deeply divergent and allopatric clades that probably represent cryptic species. The west coast clade is largely confined to the Langvlei, Verlorenvlei, Berg and Diep Rivers, the Klein River clade is endemic to the Klein River and the south coast clade is found everywhere else in the range of kurper sensu lato. It was hypothesised that divergences within kurper sensu lato probably occurred because of isolation of coastal drainages by persistent drainage divides or vicariance of current tributaries by the drowning of their confluences by high sea levels. The current distribution of lineages could be due to historical range expansion and gene flow via river capture or some other mode of transdivide dispersal or dispersal during periods of low sea level via paleoriver confluences of currently isolated coastal rivers. Comparison of BEAST2 estimated divergence times with the timing of climatic, geological and geomorphological events supported long-term coastal drainage isolation, punctuated by rare transdivide dispersal events and limited paleoriver dispersal, as the best explanation of current phylogeographic and divergence patterns in kurper. Hydrological barriers that block upstream passage in palaeotributaries could hypothetically explain why kurper failed to disperse through certain palaeoriver confluences. There were several sites where biogeographic patterns have likely been confounded by human translocation of kurper. Alien fish predators and water extraction may threaten the three cryptic species more severely than previously realised, due to their smaller population sizes and inhabitation of only a portion of the range previously ascribed to kurper sensu lato. The preponderance of cryptic diversity and endemism in the CFR suggests that additional undescribed cryptic species of obligate freshwater fishes may be found in short coastal river systems around the world, especially in regions with a history of geological stability and a narrow continental shelf.

In the present study, the frequency of baseline AFP elevations and their related factors, AFP dynamics during and after DAA treatment, and factors associated with AFP reduction was assessed. This retrospective study included 141 patients with CHC without hepatocellular carcinoma who received DAA and achieved sustained virological response. The details are as follows: mean post-treatment follow-up was 99 weeks (12-213); mean age, 57.8 years old; 52%, males; 79%, genotype (GT) 1; and 47%, cirrhosis. Pre-treatment AFP elevation (> 5.5 ng/mL) was seen in 48.2% patients. On multivariate analysis, baseline AFP > 5.5 was associated with the presence of cirrhosis (P =0.001), coexisting non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () (P = 0.035), and GT 1 (P = 0.029). AFP normalization was seen in 28.2% patients at treatment week 2, in 52% at the end of treatment, and in 73.4% at the end of follow-up. Post-treatment week 24 AFP normalization was associated with the absence of cirrhosis (P = 0.003), Child-Pugh score < 6 (P = 0.015), and baseline AFP < 10 (P = 0.015). AFP elevation is common in patients with CHC and independently associated with , cirrhosis, and GT 1. DAA treatment resulted in AFP normalization as early as treatment week 2.

Current computational methods trained on in vitro binding data are limited by insufficient training data and algorithmic constraints. Here we describe MARIA (major histocompatibility complex analysis with recurrent integrated architecture; https://maria.stanford.edu/ ), a multimodal recurrent neural network for predicting the likelihood of antigen presentation from a gene of interest in the context of specific HLA class II alleles. In addition to in vitro binding measurements, MARIA is trained on peptide HLA ligand sequences identified by mass spectrometry, expression levels of antigen genes and protease cleavage signatures. Because it leverages these diverse training data and our improved machine learning framework, MARIA (area under the curve = 0.89-0.92) outperformed existing methods in validation datasets. Across independent cancer neoantigen studies, peptides with high MARIA scores are more likely to elicit strong CD4 T cell responses.

Recent investigations have documented the prion-like features of tau protein and the involvement of microglial changes with tau pathology. While it is still unclear what sequence of events is causal, it is likely that tau seeding potential and microglial contribution to tau propagation act together, and are essential for the development and progression of degenerative changes. Based on available evidence, targeting tau seeds and controlling some signaling pathways in a complex inflammation process could represent a possible new therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Recent findings propose novel diagnostic assays and markers that may be used together with standard methods to complete and improve the diagnosis and classification of these diseases. In conclusion, a novel perspective on microglia-tau relations reveals new issues to investigate and imposes different approaches for developing therapeutic strategies for AD.Copyright © 2019 Španić, Langer Horvat, Hof and Šimić.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630897>NAFLD and Atherosclerosis: Two Sides of the Same Dysmetabolic Coin?</a></h2><p>The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly increasing and may put patients at increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (asCVD). Both disease phenotypes often co-occur, in the case of obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus type 2, and the metabolic syndrome. We explore the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the epidemiology of asCVD in NAFLD patients, shared drivers of both phenotypes, and factors caused by NAFLD that contribute to asCVD.

First, mice aged five weeks were divided into two groups (vehicle group and canagliflozin group) and were treated for three weeks. Then, mice aged five weeks were divided into three groups of nine animals each: the vehicle group, early canagliflozin group (treated from five to nine weeks), and continuous canagliflozin group (treated from five to 16 weeks). Canagliflozin was administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg in these experiments. In addition, the in vitro effects of canagliflozin were investigated using HepG2 cells, a human HCC cell line. At the age of eight or 16 weeks, the histological non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score was lower in the canagliflozin-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice. There were significantly fewer hepatic tumors in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly fewer glutamine synthetase-positive nodules in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Expression of α-fetoprotein mRNA, a marker of HCC, was downregulated in the continuous canagliflozin group when compared with the vehicle group. At 16 weeks, there was diffuse SGLT1 expression in the hepatic lobules and strong expression by hepatocytes in the vehicle group, while SGLT2 expression was stronger in liver tumors than in the lobules. In the in vitro study, canagliflozin (10 μM) suppressed the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry showed that canagliflozin reduced the percentage of HepG2 cells in the G2/M phase due to arrest in the G1 phase along with decreased expression of cyclin D and Cdk4 proteins, while it increased the percentage of cells in the G0/1 phase. Canagliflozin also induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells via activation of caspase 3. In this mouse model of diabetes and /HCC, canagliflozin showed anti-steatotic and anti-inflammatory effects that attenuated the development of  and prevented the progression of  to HCC, partly due to the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis as well as the reduction of tumor growth through the direct inhibition of SGLT2 in tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641060>Identifying Ontario geographic regions to assess adults who present to hospital with laboratory-defined conditions: a descriptive study.</a></h2><p>In 2007, an electronic repository called the Ontario Laboratories Information System (OLIS) was introduced to allow health care providers timely access to laboratory test results. Since not all laboratories began submitting their data to OLIS simultaneously, we sought to create a date-dependent table of geographic regions (forward sortation areas [FSAs]) from which people would likely present to a hospital linked to OLIS.In this descriptive study, we used administrative data to capture adults in Ontario who presented to the emergency department for any reason from 2007 to 2017. To assess changes over time, we classified all emergency department visits into fiscal quarters. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of people in a given FSA presenting to an emergency department at an OLIS-linked hospital (v. a hospital not linked to OLIS). To be included in the catchment area, at least 90% of all emergency department visits in a given quarter from a given FSA must have occurred at an OLIS-linked hospital.By Dec. 31, 2017, 323 (61.4%) of 526 Ontario FSAs were in the catchment area (a population of about 8.5 million). There were no differences in selected demographic characteristics or comorbidities between people residing within the catchment area of OLIS-linked hospitals and those residing in the catchment area of unlinked hospitals on Dec. 31, 2017. We used the FSA information to construct a date-dependent table of geographic areas likely to have hospital laboratory data available in OLIS for future studies.We identified relevant Ontario geographic regions from which people would likely present to a hospital linked to OLIS.

However, present water quality models are weak in predicting P losses, particularly in tile-drained and manure-applied cropland. We developed a field-scale P management model, the Root Zone Water Quality Model version 2-Phosphorus (RZWQM2-P), whose accuracy in simulating P losses from manure applied agricultural field is yet to be tested. The objectives of this study were (i) to assess the accuracy of this new model in simulating dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and particulate phosphorus (PP) losses in surface runoff and tile drainage from a manure amended field, and (ii) to identify best management practices to mitigate manure P losses including water table control, manure application timing, and spreading methods by the use of model simulation. The model was evaluated against data collected from a liquid cattle manure applied field with maize ( L.)-soybean [ (L.) Merr.] rotation in Ontario, Canada. The results revealed that the RZWQM2-P model satisfactorily simulated DRP and PP losses through both surface runoff and tile drainage (-Sutcliffe efficiency > 0.50, percentage bias within ±25%, and index of agreement > 0.75). Compared with conventional management practices, manure injection reduced the P losses by 18%, whereas controlled drainage and winter manure application increased P losses by 13 and 23%, respectively. The RZWQM2-P is a promising tool for P management in manured and subsurface drained agricultural field. The injection of manure rather than controlled drainage is an effective management practice to mitigate P losses from a subsurface-drained field.© 2019 The Authors.

Due to the epidemic obesity, NAFLD is representing a global health issue and the leading cause of liver damage worldwide. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is closely related to insulin resistance (IR), adiposity and physical inactivity as well as genetic and epigenetic factors corroborate to the development and progression of hepatic steatosis and liver injury. Emerging evidence has outlined the implication of gut microbiota and gut-derived endotoxins as actively contributors to NAFLD pathophysiology probably due to the tight anatomo-functional crosstalk between the gut and the liver. Obesity, nutrition and environmental factors might alter intestinal permeability producing a favorable micro-environment for bacterial overgrowth, mucosal inflammation and translocation of both invasive pathogens and harmful byproducts, which, in turn, influence hepatic fat composition and exacerbated pro-inflammatory and fibrotic processes. To date, no therapeutic interventions are available for NAFLD prevention and management, except for modifications in lifestyle, diet and physical exercise even though they show discouraging results due to the poor compliance of patients.

Patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) have severe hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. Therapies for ALD are very limited and even abstinence from alcohol consumption does not necessarily protect patients from progression of the disease. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of a liver X receptor (LXR) inverse agonist, SR9238, in an animal model of ALD. SR9238 suppresses hepatic lipogenesis, a pathological hallmark of ALD, and we hypothesized that targeting suppression of hepatic metabolic pathways that are activated in ALD may be an effective treatment for the disease. A chronic ethanol diet with or without a final ethanol binge treatment was used to induce ALD in mice. Mice were administered the liver specific LXR inverse agonist SR9238 for 4 weeks after the mice had been maintained on the ethanol diet for 14 days. Mice developed all the hallmarks of advanced ALD demonstrating significant pathophysiology and hepatotoxicity. SR9238 significantly attenuated liver injury and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis was nearly eliminated in SR9238 treated mice. SR9238 treatment reversed the damage associated with chronic ethanol use returning the liver to near normal morphology.

We recently developed a novel procedure based on sialic acid linkage-specific alkylamidation via lactone ring opening (aminolysis-SALSA). Herein, we have investigated an isotope labeling of α2,3-linked sialic acid residues (iSALSA) using amine hydrochloride salts. One limitation of SALSA using amine hydrochloride salts may be solved by adding only -butylamine (t-BA) as an acid scavenger, and comparative and quantitative glycomic analyses can be performed using iSALSA. We also developed quantitative glycomic analysis using dual isotope-labeled glycans by derivatizing with aminooxy-functionalized tryptophanylarginine methyl ester (aoWR) and iSALSA at the reducing and nonreducing end, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the amount of α2,3-linked sialoglycans in serum are altered during liver fibrosis using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography MS (LC/MS) analyses. We revealed that the ratio of A3 to A3F was gradually decreased along with liver fibrosis progression. Therefore, these glycan alterations are potential diagnostic markers of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () fibrosis progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672989>GWAS for systemic sclerosis identifies multiple risk loci and highlights fibrotic and vasculopathy pathways.</a></h2><p>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease that shows one of the highest mortality rates among rheumatic diseases. We perform a large genome-wide association study (GWAS), and meta-analysis with previous GWASs, in 26,679 individuals and identify 27 independent genome-wide associated signals, including 13 new risk loci. The novel associations nearly double the number of genome-wide hits reported for SSc thus far. We define 95% credible sets of less than 5 likely causal variants in 12 loci. Additionally, we identify specific SSc subtype-associated signals. Functional analysis of high-priority variants shows the potential function of SSc signals, with the identification of 43 robust target genes through HiChIP. Our results point towards molecular pathways potentially involved in vasculopathy and fibrosis, two main hallmarks in SSc, and highlight the spectrum of critical cell types for the disease.

In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1.2 kg/m , glucose 103±2 mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C -acetate IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function.

Stress is physiological and biological response to maintain homeostasis of body against stressors while severe stress response is an important contributor to various illnesses including metabolic syndrome and brain disorders. We have evaluated the effects of intermittent restraint stress on NAFLD in a HFD-fed mouse model. C57/BL6 mice had free access to a 60% HFD for 8 weeks, with or without intermittent restraint stress (3 h) conducted 3 times a week. HFD administration increased fat accumulation in liver tissues. Unlike the stressed standard diet group, the levels of hepatic total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly ameliorated in the HFD with stress group compared to the HFD alone group. These beneficial results were in accordance with serum levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and hepatic levels of TNF-α and oxidative stress parameters (ROS, NO, and malondialdehyde). The intermittent restraint stress significantly attenuated the HFD-derived alterations in serum insulin levels, hepatic protein kinase B (AKT) activity and gene expression especially related to lipogenesis. This intermittent restraint stress also elevated the serum epinephrine concentration and activated the adrenergic receptor β2 or β 3 in livers or WAT. The activations of energy expenditure markers (UCP1, PGC1α) in brown adipose tissue and the browning of WAT were also observed in the HFD with stress group.

Current and traditional models implicate the consciously perceived hedonic qualities of food as driving overeating, whereas subliminal signals arising from the gut would curb our uncontrolled desire for calories. Here we review recent animal and human studies that support a markedly different model for food reward. These findings reveal in particular the existence of subcortical body-to-brain neural pathways linking gastrointestinal nutrient sensors to the brain's reward regions. Unexpectedly, consciously perceptible hedonic qualities appear to play a less relevant, and mostly transient, role in food reinforcement. In this model, gut-brain reward pathways bypass cranial taste and aroma sensory receptors and the cortical networks that give rise to flavor perception.

We investigate the relationship between the number of missed study visits (MSVs) within each episode of 2 consecutively attended visits (MSVs) and subsequent HIV risk in a predominantly FSW cohort.Women at high risk of HIV are invited to attend an ongoing dedicated clinic offering a combination HIV prevention intervention in Kampala, Uganda. Study visits are scheduled once every 3 months. The analysis included HIV-seronegative women with ≥1 follow-up visit from enrollment (between April 2008 and May 2017) to August 2017. Cox regression models were fitted adjusted for characteristics on sociodemographic, reproductive, behavioral, and sexually transmitted infections (through clinical examination and serological testing for syphilis).Among 2206 participants, HIV incidence was 3.1/100 (170/5540) person-years [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6 to 3.5]. Incidence increased from 2.6/100 person-years (95% CI: 2.1 to 3.2) in episodes without a MSV to 3.0/100 (95% CI: 2.2 to 4.1) for 1-2 MSVs and 4.3/100 (95% CI: 3.3 to 5.6) for ≥3 MSVs. Relative to episodes without a MSV, the hazard ratios (adjusted for confounding variables) were 1.40 (95% CI: 0.93 to 2.12) for 1-2 MSVs and 2.00 (95% CI: 1.35 to 2.95) for ≥3 MSVs (P-trend = 0.001).Missing study visits was associated with increased subsequent HIV risk.

It is often unclear whether this finding is a non-specific consequence of cirrhosis or indicative of underlying A1ATD (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) contributing to the cirrhosis. In this study, explanted livers were retrospectively evaluated for histopathology (including PASD status with confirmatory A1AT immunohistochemistry), and chart review provided etiology of liver failure and general clinical parameters. RT-PCR (real-time PCR) was used to detect A1AT genotype (SERPINA1 S and Z alleles) by melting curve analysis on liver explant tissue from selected cases. Of 196 explanted livers, 21 (11%) had PASD+ globules. PASD+ globules were significantly enriched in patients with a clinical diagnosis of  (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 47%) compared to other causes such as chronic ethanol use (16%) and chronic hepatitis C virus infection (6.7%) (P 0.001). Immunohistochemistry confirmed all PASD+ globules were A1AT positive, with 20 of 21 cases demonstrating diffuse A1AT staining. In an expanded  cohort, 42% (14/33) of explants had PASD+ globules, and 92% of these PASD+ cases were homozygous (n=1) or heterozygous (n=11) for the SERPINA1 Z allele, corresponding to nearly 40% of all  patients. Overall, the Z allele was present in 10% of all liver explants tested, with 85% of PASD+ cases genotyping homozygous (n=2) or heterozygous (n=20), far in excess of the estimated 2% in the general population. Conclusion: These results indicate PASD+ A1AT globules (with confirmatory genotyping showing at least one Z allele) are commonly observed in , suggesting a synergistic relationship towards liver fibrosis. In addition, the high frequency of SERPINA1 Z alleles in liver transplantation patients supports the utility of pre-transplant genotyping.Copyright © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623280>Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the Transition from  to HCC.</a></h2><p>The liver constantly adapts to meet energy requirements of the whole body.

NAFLD was diagnosed from detection of steatosis by histology or imaging, no alcohol intake, and exclusion of other liver diseases. Cirrhosis was defined by histological features, imaging data, and symptoms. We compared NAFLD-related HCC with or without cirrhosis and non-cirrhotic NAFLD with or without HCC.There were 48 non-cirrhotic HCC patients and 71 cirrhotic HCC patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that other than liver function factors male gender (OR: 5.603, 95%CI: 1.577-19.900), light drinker (OR: 2.797, 95%CI: 1.031-7.589), and tumor size (OR: 1.031, 95%CI 1.009-1.055) differ significantly between these two groups. The recurrence rate was significantly lower in the non-cirrhotic HCC group than the cirrhotic HCC group, with risk factors being des-γ-carboxy prothrombin and the number of HCCs. The non-cirrhotic HCC group showed significantly better survival due to absence of non-cancerous liver failure. Comparison between non-cirrhotic NAFLD patients with or without HCC (n=612) revealed the following risk factors for HCC: male gender (OR: 7.774, 95%CI: 2.176-27.775), light drinker (OR: 4.893, 95%CI: 1.923-12.449), and high FIB4-index (OR 2.634, 95%CI: 1.787-3.884).In patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD, important risk factors for HCC were male gender, alcohol consumption, and the FIB4-index.

PBPK models verified with PK data from healthy subjects well recovered the PK in  subjects for morphine (involving OCT1) and its glucuronide metabolites (MRP2/MRP3/OATP1B),  TC-mebrofenen (OATP1B/MRP2/MRP3), and rosuvastatin (OATP1B/breast cancer resistance protein). Overall, considerations to altered protein expression can enable quantitative prediction of PK changes in subjects with NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2019 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620616>Pharmacologic therapy for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis focusing on pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>The paradigm of chronic liver diseases has been shifting.

In contrast, the burden of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing for decades, and 25 to 30% of the general population in Korea is estimated to have NAFLD.

NAFLD is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. The pathophysiology is complex and associated with lipotoxicity, inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, and insulin resistance. The only proven effective treatment is weight reduction by diet and exercise. However, this may not be effective for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, effective drugs are urgently needed for treating these conditions. Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved for the treatment of .

NAFLD is characterized by hepatic steatosis and may progress to an inflammatory condition termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It became evident in the last years that NAFLD pathophysiology is complex and involves diverse immunological and metabolic pathways. An association between intestinal signals (e.g., derived from the gut microbiota) and the development of obesity and its metabolic consequences such as NAFLD are increasingly recognized. Pre-clinical studies have shown that germ-free mice are protected against obesity and hepatic steatosis. Several human studies from the past years have demonstrated that NAFLD contains a disease-specific gut microbiome signature. Controlled studies propose that certain bacteria with rather pro-inflammatory features such as Proteobacteria or  are dominantly present in these patients. In contrast, rather protective bacteria such as  are decreased in NAFLD patients. Furthermore, various bacterial metabolites and microbiota-generated secondary bile acids are involved in NAFLD-associated metabolic dysfunction. Although these findings are exciting, research currently lack evidence that interference at the level of the gut microbiome is beneficial for these diseases. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to advance this aspect of NAFLD research and to support the notion that the intestinal microbiota is indeed of major relevance in this disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584681>Association of Histologic Disease Activity With Progression of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>The histologic evolution of the full spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and factors associated with progression or regression remain to be definitively established.To evaluate the histologic evolution of NAFLD and the factors associated with changes in disease severity over time.A prospective cohort substudy from the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network ( CRN) NAFLD Database study, a noninterventional registry, was performed at 8 university medical research centers. Masked assessment of liver histologic specimens was performed, using a prespecified protocol to score individual biopsies. Participants included 446 adults with NAFLD enrolled in the  CRN Database studies between October 27, 2004, and September 13, 2013, who underwent 2 liver biopsies 1 or more year apart. Data analysis was performed from October 2016 to October 2018.Progression and regression of fibrosis stage, using clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings, including the NAFLD activity score (NAS) (sum of scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning; range, 0-8, with 8 indicating more severe disease).A total of 446 adults (mean [SD] age, 47 [11] years; 294 [65.9%] women) with NAFLD (NAFL, 86 [19.3%]), borderline  (84 [18.8%]), and definite  (276 [61.9%]) were studied. Over a mean (SD) interval of 4.9 (2.8) years between biopsies, NAFL resolved in 11 patients (12.8%) and progressed to steatohepatitis in 36 patients (41.9%).

Fibrosis progression or regression by at least 1 stage occurred in 132 (30%) and 151 [34%] participants, respectively. Metabolic syndrome (20 [95%] vs 108 [72%]; P = .03), baseline NAS (mean [SD], 5.0 [1.4] vs 4.3 [1.6]; P = .005), and smaller reduction in NAS (-0.2 [2] vs -0.9 [2]; P < .001) were associated with progression to advanced (stage 3-4) fibrosis vs those without progression to stage 3 to 4 fibrosis. Fibrosis regression was associated with lower baseline insulin level (20 vs 33 μU/mL; P = .02) and decrease in all NAS components (steatosis grade -0.8 [0.1] vs -0.3 [0.9]; P < .001; lobular inflammation -0.5 [0.8] vs -0.2 [0.9]; P < .001; ballooning -0.7 [1.1] vs -0.1 [0.9]; P < .001).

We examined whether universal antiretroviral treatment (ART) eligibility policies (Treat All) improved rapid ART initiation following care enrollment among 10-14-year-olds in seven sub-Saharan African countries.Regression discontinuity analysis and data for 6,912 10-14-year-old patients were used to estimate changes in rapid ART initiation (within 30 days of care enrollment) following adoption of Treat All policies in two groups of countries: Uganda and Zambia (policy adopted in 2013) and Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Malawi, and Rwanda (policy adopted in 2016).There were immediate increases in rapid ART initiation among young adolescents after national adoption of Treat All. Increases were greater in countries adopting the policy in 2016, compared with those adopting it in 2013: 23.4 percentage points (pp) (95%CI: 13.9-32.8) vs. 11.2pp (95%CI: 2.5-19.9). However, the rate of increase in rapid ART initiation among 10-14-year-olds rose appreciably in countries with earlier treatment expansions, from 1.5pp per year before Treat All to 7.7pp afterwards.Universal ART eligibility has increased rapid treatment initiation among young adolescents enrolling in HIV care.

They can be acquired from medical waste such as adipose and umbilical cord tissues, are influenced by culturing conditions, and exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-fibrotic, and angiogenic effects. We analyzed the multi-directional effects of MSCs cultured under hypoxic conditions and their underlying mechanisms in the treatment of liver cirrhosis in a mouse model.Human bone marrow-derived MSCs cultured under hypoxic (5% O; hypoMSCs) and normoxic (21% O; norMSCs) conditions were compared by cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) with or without serum from liver cirrhosis patients. The therapeutic effects of MSCs, including serum liver enzyme induction, fibrosis regression, and hepatic oxidative stress, were evaluated by injecting 1 × 10, 2 × 10, or 4 × 10 MSCs/mouse into the tail veins of mice with carbon tetrachloride (CCl)-induced liver cirrhosis. Intravital imaging was performed with a two-photon excitation microscope to confirm the various MSC migration paths to the liver.CAGE analysis revealed that the RNA expression levels of prostaglandin E synthase () and miR210 were significantly higher in hypoMSCs than in norMSCs.  analysis revealed that both hypoMSCs and norMSCs reduced serum alanine aminotransferase, oxidative stress, and fibrosis compared to that in control mice in a dose-dependent manner. However, hypoMSCs had stronger therapeutic effects than norMSCs. We confirmed this observation by an  study in which hypoMSCs changed macrophage polarity to an anti-inflammatory phenotype via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) stimulation. In addition, miR210 reduced the rate of hepatocyte apoptosis. Intravital imaging after MSC administration showed that both cell types were primarily trapped in the lungs. Relatively a few hypoMSCs and norMSCs migrated to the liver. There were no significant differences in their distributions.The therapeutic effect of hypoMSCs was mediated by PGE2 and miR210 production and was greater than that of norMSCs. Therefore, MSCs can be manipulated to improve their therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of liver cirrhosis and could potentially serve in effective cell therapy. MSCs produce several factors with multidirectional effects and function as "conducting cells" in liver cirrhosis.© 2019 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

Patients with both T2DM and  have increased risk for adverse clinical outcomes, leading to higher risk for mortality and morbidity. We built a Markov model with 1-year cycles and 20-year horizon to estimate the economic burden of  with T2DM in the U.S.Cohort size was determined by population size, prevalence of T2DM, and prevalence and incidence of  in 2017. The model includes 10 health states: NAFL, -fibrosis stages 0-3, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 year post-liver transplant, post-liver transplant, and liver-related, cardiovascular, and background mortality. Transition probabilities were calculated from meta-analyses and literature. Annual costs for  and T2DM were taken from literature and billing codes.We estimated that there were 18.2 million people in the U.S. living with T2DM and NAFLD, of which 6.4 million had . Twenty-year costs for NAFLD in these patients were $55.8 billion. Over the next 20 years,  with T2DM will account for 65,000 transplants, 1.37 million cardiovascular-related deaths, and 812,000 liver-related deaths.This model predicts significant clinical and economic burden due to  with T2DM over the next 20 years. In fact, this burden may be greater since we assumed conservative inputs for our model and did not increase costs or the incidence of T2DM over time. It is highly likely that interventions reducing morbidity and mortality in  patients with T2DM could potentially reduce this projected clinical and economic burden.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695251>Molecular and Pathological Events Involved in the Pathogenesis of Diabetes-Associated Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is a rising epidemic in most part of the world and is often associated with multiple organ disorders such as kidney, liver, and cardiovascular diseases. Liver is a major metabolic hub, and the metabolic disorders associated with diabetes result in liver dysfunctions culminating in spectrum of liver diseases such as fatty liver disorders, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The intervention strategies to prevent diabetes-associated liver injury require an overall understanding of the key factors and molecular pathways which can be strategically targeted. The present review focuses on some of the key aspects of fatty acid metabolism, fetuin-A regulation, inflammatory pathways, and genetic factors associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and so on involved in the nexus between diabetes and liver injury. Further recent interventions, pharmacological target, and newer therapeutic agents are discussed briefly for the better clinical management of diabetes-associated hepatic disorders.© 2018 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver.

Although obesity is a known risk factor for NAFLD, individuals with normal body mass index (BMI) also have hepatic fatty infiltration, now termed "lean-NAFLD". It represents a distinct entity with a strong underlying genetic component. The present study aimed to sequence the complete exonic regions of individuals with lean-NAFLD to identify germline causative variants associated with disrupted hepatic fatty acid metabolism, thereby conferring susceptibility to NAFLD.Whole blood was collected from patients with lean-NAFLD (n = 6; BMI < 23.0 kg/m) and matched lean controls (n = 2; discovery set). Liver fat was assessed using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging. Patients with ultrasound-detected NAFLD (n = 191) and controls (n = 105) were part of validation set. DNA was isolated, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in the discovery cohort (Ion Proton™; Ion AmpliSeq™ Exome RDY Kit). Data were analyzed (Ion Reporter software; Life Technologies), and variants identified. Validation of variants was carried out (Taqman probes; Real time-PCR). Student's t test and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the statistical significance.Although WES identified ∼74,000 variants in individual samples, using various pipelines. variants in genes namely phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein10 (OSBPL10) that have roles in dietary choline intake and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, respectively, were identified (discovery set). Furthermore, significant differences were noted in BMI (p = 0.006), waist/hip circumference (p > 0.001), waist/hip ratio (p > 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (p > 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (p > 0.001), and triglycerides (p = 0.002) between patients and controls. Validation of variants (rs7946-PEMT and rs2290532-OSBPL10) revealed that variant in PEMT but not OSBPL10 gene was associated (p = 0.04) with threefold increased risk of NAFLD in lean individuals.Our results demonstrate the association of rs7946 with lean-NAFLD.

Their capacity to build enduring crusts that underpin the formation of tropical reefs, rhodolith beds and other benthic substrate is dependent on the formation of a calcified thallus. However, this important process of skeletal carbonate formation is not well understood. We undertook a study of cellular carbonate features to develop a model for calcification. We describe two types of cell wall calcification; 1) calcified primary cell wall (PCW) in the thin-walled elongate cells such as central medullary cells in articulated corallines and hypothallial cells in crustose coralline algae (CCA), 2) calcified secondary cell wall (SCW) with radial Mg-calcite crystals in thicker-walled rounded cortical cells of articulated corallines and perithallial cells of CCA. The distinctive banding found in many rhodoliths is the regular transition from PCW-only cells to SCW cells. Within the cell walls there can be bands of elevated Mg with Mg content of a few mol% higher than radial Mg-calcite (M-type), ranging up to dolomite composition (D-type).We propose the following three-step model for calcification. 1) A thin (< 0.5 μm) PCW forms and is filled with a mineralising fluid of organic compounds and seawater. Nanometer-scale Mg-calcite grains precipitate on the organic structures within the PCW. 2) Crystalline cellulose microfibrils (CMF) are extruded perpendicularly from the cellulose synthase complexes (CSC) in the plasmalemma to form the SCW. 3) The CMF soaks in the mineralising fluid as it extrudes and becomes calcified, retaining the perpendicular form, thus building the radial calcite. In Clathromorphum, SCW formation lags PCW creating a zone of weakness resulting in a split in the sub-surface crust. All calcification seems likely to be a bioinduced rather than controlled process. These findings are a substantial step forward in understanding how corallines calcify.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622202>Protective effect of incretin aganist age-related disease.</a></h2><p>Incretin contains two peptides named glucagon-like peptide-1and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide.

In this form of patterning, neurons of distinct types localize their cell bodies to just one or a few of the layers within a structure. However, little is known about whether diverse neuron types within a lamina share molecular features that coordinate their organization. To begin to identify such candidates, we used the laminated murine retina to screen 92 lacZ reporter lines available through the Knockout Mouse Project. Thirty-two of these displayed reporter expression in restricted subsets of inner retina neurons. We then identified the spatiotemporal expression patterns of these genes at key developmental stages. This uncovered several that were heavily enriched in development but reduced in adulthood, including the transcriptional regulator Hmga1. An additional set of genes displayed maturation associated laminar enrichment. Among these, we identified Bbox1 as a novel gene that specifically labels all neurons in the ganglion cell layer but is largely excluded from otherwise molecularly similar neurons in the inner retina. Finally, we established Dbn1 as a new marker enriched in amacrines and Fmnl3 as a marker for subsets of αRGCs. Together, these data provide a spatiotemporal map for laminae-specific molecules and suggest that diverse neuron types within a lamina share coordinating molecular features that may inform their fate or function.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658196>Treatment as Prevention: Concepts and Challenges for Reducing HIV Incidence.</a></h2><p>Four of the largest HIV prevention trials have been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, enrolling hundreds of thousands of participants in catchment areas of millions of people.

Universal test-and-treat strategies are deployed to achieve viral suppression thereby reducing risk to uninfected persons, known as treatment as prevention (TasP).We review the work that found HIV plasma load to correlate with transmission risk, demonstrated that ART could reduce genital tract viral expression, and showed early treatment to be beneficial for persons living with HIV, and that HIV-uninfected sexual partners were protected from infection. We review the seemingly inconsistent findings of the major TasP trials: the TasP [National Agency for AIDS Research (ANRS) 12249] study in South Africa, the SEARCH trial in Kenya and Uganda, the Botswana Combination Prevention Project Ya Tsie study, and the HIV Prevention Trials Network 071 (PopART) trial in Zambia and South Africa.All the trials reinforce the critical need to identify approaches to optimize programs and incentivize uptake and engagement in HIV testing and ART-based care in ways that consistently reduce HIV transmission.

Therefore, of the 50 patients with a known history, 9 (18%) had died of cirrhosis or were unable to attend the examination because of their liver disease. The remaining population was predominantly female (61.5%), mean age of 63 years, being overweight, dyslipidemia (76.9%), disorders of the glycemic profile (76.9%), and metabolic syndrome (82.1%). Of the 39 cases evaluated, 35% had the same degree of fibrosis at the initial evaluation (biopsy) and at the current evaluation (elastography), 33% had an increase in the degree of fibrosis and another 30% had a decrease in the degree of fibrosis. Twenty-eight patients had  at baseline. Regarding these patients, it was observed in the current evaluation, that 25% remained stable in the degree of fibrosis, 39% progressed, and 35% regressed.Despite some limitations of our study, such as the small number of patients, and the use of two different methods of evaluation (biopsy and elastography), the data obtained allow us to conclude that of the 39 evaluated cases, 33% (13) presented progression of fibrosis and the total group of 50 patients, 42% had cirrhosis or died due to liver disease. The presence of  on hepatic biopsy did not prove to be, in our study, a predictive of the evolution of hepatic fibrosis in the patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661503>Carbon emission reduction and profit distribution mechanism of construction supply chain with fairness concern and cap-and-trade.</a></h2><p>Fairness concern behavior is extremely common in social life, and many scholars are beginning to pay attention to this behavior. In this study, we investigate a two-echelon construction supply chain that consists of a general contractor and a subcontractor under cap-and-trade policy. We study the carbon emission reduction decisions and profit distribution mechanism in the construction supply chain with fairness concern and cap-and-trade. We use the  bargaining model to describe the fairness concerns of the construction supply chain members and use the co-opetition model to portray the profit distribution. We show that the fairness concern can impose an adverse influence on firms' profits and decrease the magnitude of their carbon emission reductions. The subcontractor's fairness concern causes greater losses to the construction supply chain's profit. We further demonstrate the impact of fairness concern on the optimal decisions of the general contractor and the subcontractor through numerical analysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570461>Diabetes Mellitus and/or Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis-related Hepatocellular Carcinoma Showed Favorable Surgical Outcomes After Hepatectomy.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known as an important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, surgical outcomes in patients with DM and HCC have not been evaluated in detail.We retrospectively studied 177 patients with type 2 DM who underwent curative hepatectomy for HCC. Surgical outcomes after curative hepatectomy and prognostic factors were evaluated among 75 patients with DM and/or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ()-related HCC and 102 patients with DM and viral or alcoholic hepatitis (VAH)-related HCC.The 5-year survival rate and 5-year recurrence-free survival rate were significantly higher in the DM and/or -related HCC group (87% and 51%) than in the DM and VAH-related HCC group (68%: p=0.0001 and 26%: p=0.0002). Multivariate analysis showed DM and/or -related HCC to be significant independent prognostic factors for overall survival and recurrence-free survival.Patients with DM and/or -related HCC showed more favorable surgical outcomes after hepatectomy in patients with DM and HCC.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Clear knowledge of the circumscribed set of genes that are affected in Williams syndrome, along with the well-characterized neurobehavioural phenotype, offers the potential to elucidate neurogenetic principles that may apply in genetically and clinically more complex settings. The intraparietal sulcus, in the dorsal visual processing stream, has been shown to be structurally and functionally altered in Williams syndrome, providing a target for investigating resting-state functional connectivity and effects of specific genes hemideleted in Williams syndrome. Here, we tested for effects of the LIMK1 gene, deleted in Williams syndrome and important for neuronal maturation and migration, on intraparietal sulcus functional connectivity. We first defined a target brain phenotype by comparing intraparietal sulcus resting functional connectivity in individuals with Williams syndrome, in whom LIMK1 is hemideleted, with typically developing children. Then in two separate cohorts from the general population, we asked whether intraparietal sulcus functional connectivity patterns similar to those found in Williams syndrome were associated with sequence variation of the LIMK1 gene. Four independent between-group comparisons of resting-state functional MRI data (total n = 510) were performed: (i) 20 children with Williams syndrome compared to 20 age- and sex-matched typically developing children; (ii) a discovery cohort of 99 healthy adults stratified by LIMK1 haplotype; (iii) a replication cohort of 32 healthy adults also stratified by LIMK1 haplotype; and (iv) 339 healthy adolescent children stratified by LIMK1 haplotype. For between-group analyses, differences in intraparietal sulcus resting-state functional connectivity were calculated comparing children with Williams syndrome to matched typically developing children and comparing LIMK1 haplotype groups in each of the three general population cohorts separately. Consistent with the visuospatial construction impairment and hypersocial personality that typify Williams syndrome, the Williams syndrome cohort exhibited opposite patterns of intraparietal sulcus functional connectivity with visual processing regions and social processing regions: decreased circuit function in the former and increased circuit function in the latter. All three general population groups also showed LIMK1 haplotype-related differences in intraparietal sulcus functional connectivity localized to the fusiform gyrus, a visual processing region also identified in the Williams syndrome-typically developing comparison. These results suggest a neurogenetic mechanism, in part involving LIMK1, that may bias neural circuit function in both the general population and individuals with Williams syndrome.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Guarantors of Brain 2019.

Given its high prevalence, the absence of FDA-approved drugs for NAFLD is noticeable. In the pathogenesis of NAFLD, it is well known that mitochondrial dysfunction arises as a result of changes in ETC complexes and the membrane potential (Δψm), as well as decreased ATP synthesis. Due to their fundamental role in energy metabolism and cell death decision, alterations in mitochondria are considered to be critical factors causing NAFLD. Reduced levels of β-oxidation, along with increased lipogenesis, result in lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, and the subsequent production of reactive oxygen species and hepatocyte injury, which contribute to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis through the activations of Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells. Here, we review the latest findings describing the involvement of mitochondrial processes in the development of NAFLD and discuss the potential targets against which therapeutics for this disease can be developed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679946>Efficacy and safety of the elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor combination regimen in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation: a double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial.</a></h2><p>Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators correct the basic defect caused by CFTR mutations. Improvements in health outcomes have been achieved with the combination of a CFTR corrector and potentiator in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation. The addition of elexacaftor (VX-445), a next-generation CFTR corrector, to tezacaftor plus ivacaftor further improved F508del-CFTR function and clinical outcomes in a phase 2 study in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation.This phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial of elexacaftor in combination with tezacaftor plus ivacaftor was done at 44 sites in four countries. Eligible participants were those with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation, aged 12 years or older with stable disease, and with a percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV) of 40-90%, inclusive. After a 4-week tezacaftor plus ivacaftor run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 4 weeks of elexacaftor 200 mg orally once daily plus tezacaftor 100 mg orally once daily plus ivacaftor 150 mg orally every 12 h versus tezacaftor 100 mg orally once daily plus ivacaftor 150 mg orally every 12 h alone. The primary outcome was the absolute change from baseline (measured at the end of the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor run-in) in ppFEV at week 4. Key secondary outcomes were absolute change in sweat chloride and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain (CFQ-R RD) score. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, .Between Aug 3 and Dec 28, 2018, 113 participants were enrolled. Following the run-in, 107 participants were randomly assigned (55 in the elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group and 52 in the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group) and completed the 4-week treatment period. The elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group had improvements in the primary outcome of ppFEV (least squares mean [LSM] treatment difference of 10·0 percentage points [95% CI 7·4 to 12·6], p<0·0001) and the key secondary outcomes of sweat chloride concentration (LSM treatment difference -45·1 mmol/L [95% CI -50·1 to -40·1], p<0·0001), and CFQ-R RD score (LSM treatment difference 17·4 points [95% CI 11·8 to 23·0], p<0·0001) compared with the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group. The triple combination regimen was well tolerated, with no discontinuations. Most adverse events were mild or moderate; serious adverse events occurred in two (4%) participants receiving elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor and in one (2%) receiving tezacaftor plus ivacaftor.Elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor provided clinically robust benefit compared with tezacaftor plus ivacaftor alone, with a favourable safety profile, and shows the potential to lead to transformative improvements in the lives of people with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for the F508del mutation.Vertex Pharmaceuticals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasingly, these parameters include MRI-derived proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and MR elastography (MRE)-derived shear stiffness as biomarkers of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. Understanding fluctuations in these measures is essential for calculating trial sample sizes, interpreting results, and planning clinical drug trials in children with NAFLD. Lack of such data in children comprises a critical knowledge gap. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to assess whole-liver MRI-PDFF change in adolescents with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () over 12 weeks.Adolescents 12-19 years with biopsy-proven  undergoing standard-of-care treatment were enrolled. Baseline and week-12 assessments of anthropometrics, transaminases, MRI-PDFF, and MRE-stiffness were obtained.Fifteen adolescents were included (mean age 15.7 [SD 2.9] years). Hepatic MRI-PDFF was stable over 12 weeks (mean absolute change -0.8%, p = 0.24). Correlation between baseline and week-12 values of MRI-PDFF was high (ICC = 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 - 0.99). MRE-stiffness was stable (mean percentage change 2.7%, p = 0.44); correlation between baseline and week-12 values was moderate (ICC = 0.47; 95% CI: 0, 0.79). Changes in weight, BMI, and aminotransferases were not statistically significant.In adolescents with , fluctuations in hepatic MRI-PDFF and MRE-stiffness over 12 weeks of standard-of-care were small. These data on the natural fluctuations in quantitative imaging biomarkers can serve as a reference for interventional trials in pediatric  and inform the interpretation and planning of clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637181>Effect of Weight Reduction on Histological Activity and Fibrosis of Lean Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Patient.</a></h2><p>Weight reduction has evidenced benefit on attenuation of histological activity and fibrosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), but there is scarcity of data for lean  subgroup. We have designed this study to compare the effects of weight reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean .We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven  patients. BMI < 25 kg/m2 was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second liver biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ 5% weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, 5/6 and 2/6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean .© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.
