<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676762>In vitro comparison of the effects of probiotic, commensal and pathogenic strains on macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are important with respect to both innate and adaptive immune responses and are known to differentiate into pro-inflammatory M1- or anti-inflammatory -phenotypes following activation. In order to study how different bacteria affect macrophage polarization, we exposed murine RAW 264.7 macrophages to sixteen different strains representing probiotic strains, pathogens, commensals and strains of food origin. Increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) or arginase-1 gene expression indicates M1 or  polarization, respectively, and was quantified by qRT-PCR. Strains of Escherichia and Salmonella elevated iNOS expression more so than strains of Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, indicating that Gram-negative strains are more potent M1 inducers. However, strain-specific responses were observed. For instance, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 was a poor inducer of iNOS gene expression compared to the other E. coli strains, while Enterococcus faecalis Symbioflor-1 was more potent in this respect compared to all the eleven Gram-positive strains tested. Macrophage polarization was further characterized by quantifying secreted pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Exposure to the pathogen E. coli 042 produced a cytokine profile indicating M1 differentiation, which is in accordance with the PCR data. However, exposure to most strains resulted in either high or low secretion levels of all cytokines tested, rather than a clear M1 or  profile. In general, the Gram-negative strains induced high levels of cytokine secretion compared to the Gram-positive strains. Interestingly, strains of human origin had a higher impact on macrophages compared to strains of food origin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29931231>Daily Consumption of Synbiotic Yogurt Decreases Liver Steatosis in Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in developed and developing countries. The use of synbiotics has been proposed as a probable management strategy for patients with NAFLD.We investigated the effects of synbiotic yogurt on hepatic steatosis and liver enzymes as primary outcomes and on oxidative stress markers, adipokine concentration, and gut peptide concentration as secondary outcomes in patients with NAFLD.In this 24-wk, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial, 102 patients [50 men and 52 women; mean age: 40 y; body mass index (in kg/) (mean ± SD): 31.2 ± 4.9] were randomly assigned to 3 groups, including 2 intervention groups and 1 control group. The intervention groups consumed 300 g synbiotic yogurt containing 108 colony-forming units Bifidobacterium animalis/mL and 1.5 g inulin or conventional yogurt daily and were advised to follow a healthy lifestyle (i.e., diet and exercise). The control group was advised to follow a healthy lifestyle alone. We evaluated differences between groups in liver function measures by using repeated-measures ANOVA, ANCOVA, and logistic regression.At the end of the study, the grades of NAFLD, as determined by ultrasonography, showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group compared with the conventional and control groups (P < 0.001). The following significant mean ± SD decreases were seen in the synbiotic, conventional, and control groups, respectively: serum concentration of alanine aminotransferase (-14.5 ± 15.6 compared with 4.6 ± 15.4 and 3.1 ± 14.4 IU/L; P = 0.008), aspartate aminotransferase (-7.5 ± 6.1 compared with 3.0 ± 8.2 and 3.1 ± 5.7 IU/L; P < 0.001), alkaline phosphatase (-26.2 ± 16.8 compared with 3.4 ± 30.1 and 1.5 ± 31.9 IU/L; P = 0.024), and γ-glutamyltransferase (-6.0 ± 6.0 compared with 1.0 ± 6.4 and 7.6 ± 11.4 IU/L; P < 0.001).Synbiotic yogurt consumption improved hepatic steatosis and liver enzyme concentrations in patients with NAFLD.

Recent studies have suggested an important role of gut microbiota (GM) in modulating the host metabolism and immune system, leading to alterations in bone mass. Probiotic bacteria administered in adequate amounts can alter the composition of GM and confer health benefits to the host. Given the inflammatory osteolysis that occurs in wear debris-induced prosthesis loosening, we examined whether the probiotic  could reduce osteolysis in a mouse calvarial resorption model. In this study,  markedly protected mice from CoCrMo particles (CoPs)-induced osteolysis. Osteoclast gene markers and the number of osteoclasts were significantly decreased in -treated mice. Probiotic treatment decreased the M1-like macrophage phenotype indicated by downregulation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and increased the -like macrophage phenotype indicated by upregulation of IL-4, IL-10 and arginase. Collectively, these results indicated that the  treatment modulated the immune status and suppressed wear particle-induced osteolysis in vivo. Thus, probiotic treatment may represent a potential preventive and therapeutic approach to reduced wear debris-induced osteolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30285152>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens spray improves the growth performance, immune status, and respiratory mucosal barrier in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Studies have shown that supplementing  in a nasal spray can provide prophylaxis against upper respiratory tract infections. Previously, we found that spraying with Bacillus reduced the concentration of atmospheric ammonia and airborne microbiological aerosols in broiler houses. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of spraying with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens on the respiratory mucosal barrier in broilers. Two trails were conducted simultaneously in four environmentally controlled chambers. In each trail, 320 1-d-old male broilers were randomly assigned to control (CON) and B. amyloliquefaciens (BAQ) group. Eight cages containing 20 birds per cage were placed in two chambers. The BAQ group chambers were sprayed with B. amyloliquefaciens at 4 × 109 CFU/ each day for 42 d. Spraying with B. amyloliquefaciens increased average daily gain and average daily feed intake in broilers (P < 0.01), but had no effects on FCR (P > 0.05). The relative weights of the bursa (21 d) and spleen (42 d) were higher in the BAQ group (P < 0.05). The serum IgG, IgM (21 d), and IgA, Ig M (42 d) levels were improved in BAQ group (P < 0.05). The sIgA levels in tracheal lavage fluid were significantly higher in the BAQ group than the CON group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, treatment with BAQ downregulated IL-6 and IFN-γ (P < 0.05), but upregulated IL-2, occludin, and mucin-2 (P < 0.05). In addition, the number of acidic goblet cells was significantly higher in the tracheas of treated broilers than untreated broilers (P < 0.05). In conclusion, spraying with B. amyloliquefaciens may help to enhance the growth performance and improve the respiratory mucosal barrier in broiler chickens.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26281160>[, NUTRITIONAL STATUS AND RESISTANCE TO RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN INFANTS].</a></h2><p>Aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of prophylactic use of a liquid probiotic form based on Enterococcus faecium L3 in children first year of life to increase resistance to acute respiratory infections (ARI) in the winter-spring period and improve nutritional status. In a specialized (psychoneurologic) orphanage of St. Petersburg within three months of winter-spring period in 2014 observed 29 children in the first year of life. Observed children were randomly divided into two groups. The main group (n = 14) within three months received daily per os liquid probiotic form based on E.faecium L3 in a daily dose of 1.5 x 10(9) CFU. A control group of children (n = 15) was comparable with the main group by gender and age. The children observed groups studied the incidence of ARI; number of vaccinated children; the number of children who received two or more vaccinations at the same time; the number of children with acute infectious diseases within 1 month after vaccination; dynamics of Chulitskaya index, body mass index, body weight and length. The data obtained are subjected to statistical analysis, the results were considered significant at p < 0.05. The results showed that the use of probiotic forms E.faecium L3 in infants helped to reduce the average number of ARI cases per child (0.29 ± 0.13 vs. 0.73 ± 0.12 in the control group; p < 0.05) only in the first month of the observation that combined with a significantly higher BMI values increase this month (0.54 ± 0.25 vs. 0.07 ± 0.22 kg/ in the control group; p < 0.05). Use the liquid probiotic form E.faecium L3 in infants had a positive impact on overall health, which is reflected in the implementation of routine vaccination activities--in the main group, the number of children who received two or more vaccinations at the same time was 18.1% more.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27063274>Current Pharmacologic Therapy for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Weight loss, regular exercise, and diet composition modification seem to improve biochemical and histologic abnormalities. Other therapies directed at insulin resistance, oxidative stress, cytoprotection, and fibrosis may also offer benefits. Insulin sensitizers and vitamin E seem to be the most promising; however, they cause side effects. A multifaceted approach of lifestyle modifications, weight loss, and pharmacotherapy can be used in combination, but no single treatment approach has proved universally applicable to the general population with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Continuous clinical and preclinical studies on existing and potential drugs are needed to improve treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/NASH.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we have set up a study to investigate the effectiveness of two probiotic formulations containing a blend of seven bacterial species in modulating intestinal inflammation in two rodent models of colitis, induced by treating mice with 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Despite the taxonomy of the bacterial species in the two probiotic formulations being similar, only one preparation (Blend 2-Vivomixx) effectively attenuated the development of colitis in both models. In the TNBS model of colitis, Blend 2 reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory genes while increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, promoting the expansion  macrophages and the formation of IL-10-producing Treg cells in the colon's . In the DSS model of colitis, disease attenuation and Treg formation was observed only in mice administered with Blend 2, and this effect was associated with intestinal microbiota remodeling and increased formation of lactate, butyrate, and propionate. None of these effects were observed in mice administered with Blend 1 (VSL#3). In summary, we have shown that two probiotic mixtures obtained by combining taxonomically similar species produced with different manufacturing methods exert divergent effects in mouse models of colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26268077>THE EFFECT OF PROBIOTIC FERMENTED MILK THAT INCLUDES BIFIDOBACTERIUM LACTIS CNCM I-2494 ON THE REDUCTION OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISCOMFORT AND SYMPTOMS IN ADULTS: A NARRATIVE REVIEW.</a></h2><p>determine the effectiveness of fermented milk that included Bifidobacterium lactis CNCM I-2429 for reducing gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort in healthy adults.we conducted a systematic literature search to identify studies reporting the use of B. animalis spp. lactis for GI discomfort/comfort in healthy adults. A total of 5329 records were identified, of these 99 full-text articles were assessed. Searches for additional trials were conducted using the names of authors of each identified study and several relevant databases. The study selection was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials; the included subjects were healthy adults; and the intervention group received B. lactis CNCM I-2494. Studies were excluded if they were non-randomized trials, if they included adults who were not healthy, if they included the use of any other intervention, or if they compared different products without a placebo group. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the Oxford Quality Scale and the Cochrane Concealment Assessment. A meta-analysis was not possible.the search strategy identified two studies that included a total of 538 healthy women, aged 18-60 years, normal weight or overweight (BMI 18-30 kg/). GI well-being was significantly improved in the Probiotic group vs. the Control group in one study, with no differences in the other. The percentage of responders for GI well-being was higher in the Probiotic group vs. the Control group in the first study but not in the second. GI symptoms were significantly decreased in the Probiotic group vs. the Control group in both studies. Bowel function was assessed by one study; the stool frequency did not differ between the groups, but a decrease in stool consistency was observed in the Probiotic group but not in the Control group. Possible mechanisms of action (gut motility, hypersensitivity, gut permeability, and gut microbiota) were also described.probiotic fermented milk containing B. lactis CNCM I-2494 by healthy women may improve GI well- being and decrease the frequency of GI symptoms.Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014.

We previously identified exopolysaccharide (EPS) from a probiotic, , that induces anti-inflammatory macrophages with an  phenotype and protects mice from -induced colitis. We tested if EPS could protect from systemic infection induced by  and found that EPS-treated mice had enhanced survival as well as reduced weight loss, systemic inflammation, and bacterial burden. While macrophages from EPS-treated mice display an  phenotype, they also restrict growth of internalized  through reactive oxygen species (ROS), reminiscent of proinflammatory phagocytes. These EPS-induced macrophages also limit T cell activation by  superantigens, and EPS abrogates systemic induction of gamma interferon after infection. We conclude that  EPS is an immunomodulatory agent that induces hybrid macrophages that bolster antibacterial immunity and simultaneously limit inflammation, reducing disease burden and promoting host survival.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30426249> ameliorate renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by modulating the phenotype of macrophages through the IL-10/GSK-3β/PTEN signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>After renal ischemic reperfusion injury, a series of pathological changes, such as impaired intestinal barrier function, intestinal flora, and endotoxin translocation, are caused by intestinal ischemia and hypoxia, which then trigger systemic inflammatory responses and affect the condition and prognosis of the patients. In this study, a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion injury was established by examining changes in renal function, intestinal barrier function, inflammatory index, oxidative stress, and macrophage phenotypes to evaluate the effect of probiotic VSL#3 on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. The results showed that, after VSL#3 intervention, the levels of BUN, Scr, Cys C, PRO, and NGAL were all significantly decreased compared with the I/R group, while the value of Ccr showed a significant increase. In addition, the concentrations of MPO, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, ED-1, and PCNA were all significantly lower than those in the I/R group, while the levels of endotoxin, DOA, and D-lactic acid were significantly decreased. Furthermore, the proteins associated with intestinal barrier functions, such as ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1, were significantly upregulated compared with the I/R group. Overall, the VSL#3 intervention group was able to maintain the required number of beneficial intestinal flora and to inhibit the proliferation of harmful bacteria. At the same time, the VSL#3 intervention could also prevent the decrease in the levels of CAT, GSH-PX, HO, and T-SOD, while downregulating the expression of Keap1 and Nrf2. After the intervention with the VSL#3, the expression levels of CD68 and CD86 proteins were significantly decreased, while the expression levels of CD163 and CD206 proteins were significantly higher. Further experiments confirmed that the expression of iNOS protein was significantly decreased after the VSL#3 intervention, and the expression of Arg-1 and Ym1 proteins was significantly increased. The VSL#3 was able to induce high expressions of p-GSK-3β and p-PTEN proteins, while the use of IL-10 antibody impaired the effect of the VSL#3. In summary, this research confirms that  can alleviate renal dysfunction caused by ischemia and reperfusion by protecting the intestinal barrier function and maintaining the functions of intestinal flora. The pathway screening test of this study suggests that IL-10/GSK3β/PTEN may play an important role in the process of the prototypic VSL#3 inducing  transformation of macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18705297>Mesalazine and/or Lactobacillus casei in maintaining long-term remission of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon.</a></h2><p>Four different therapeutic schedules with mesalazine and/or  were assessed in preventing recurrence of symptomatic diverticular disease (DD) of the colon.A prospective, dose-finding study was conducted on 75 patients, enrolled in an open fashion: mesalazine 800mg/daily (group M1) or mesalazine 1.6gr 10 days/month (group ); mesalazine 800mg/daily + Lactobacillus casei DG 16 billion/day for 10 day/month (group LM1) or mesalazine 1.6gr + Lactobacillus casei DG 16 billion/day for 10 day/month (group LM2); Lactobacillus casei DG 16 billion/day for 10 day/month (group L).Seventy one patients completed the study (94.66%).

Biofilms are communities of microbes embedded in matrices composed of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), and have been implicated in both the healthy microbiome and disease states. The immune system recognizes many different bacterial patterns, molecules, and antigens, but these components can be camouflaged in the biofilm mode of growth. Instead, immune cells come into contact with components of the EPS matrix, a diverse, hydrated mixture of extracellular DNA (bacterial and host), proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids. As bacterial cells transition from planktonic to biofilm-associated they produce small molecules, which can increase inflammation, induce cell death, and even cause necrosis. To survive, invading bacteria must overcome the epithelial barrier, host microbiome, complement, and a variety of leukocytes. If bacteria can evade these initial cell populations they have an increased chance at surviving and causing ongoing disease in the host. Planktonic cells are readily cleared, but biofilms reduce the effectiveness of both polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages. In addition, in the presence of these cells, biofilm formation is actively enhanced, and components of host immune cells are assimilated into the EPS matrix. While pathogenic biofilms contribute to states of chronic inflammation, probiotic Lactobacillus biofilms cause a negligible immune response and, in states of inflammation, exhibit robust antiinflammatory properties. These probiotic biofilms colonize and protect the gut and vagina, and have been implicated in improved healing of damaged skin. Overall, biofilms stimulate a unique immune response that we are only beginning to understand.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Group 1: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus (StLa). Group 2: a placebo yoghurt fermented with delta-acid-lactone (PY). Group 3: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and one strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (StLr). Group 4: a yoghurt fermented with one strain of Enterococcus faecium and two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus (CAUSIDO(R) culture), GAIO(R) (G). The dietary composition of the yoghurt was otherwise similar. The fifth group was given two placebo pills (PP) daily.When comparing all five treatment groups, unadjusted for changes in body weight, no statistical effects were observed in week 8 in the G-group on low density lipoproteins (LDL)-cholesterol (P=0.29). After adjustment for small changes in body weight, LDL-cholesterol decreased by 8.4% (0.26+/-0.10 mmol/l; P<0.05) and fibrinogen increased (0.74+/-0.32 mmol/l; P<0.05) after 8 weeks in the G-group. This was significantly different from the group consuming chemically fermented yoghurt and the group consuming placebo pills (P<0.05). After 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure was significantly more reduced in the StLa and G-group compared to StLr. No other differences were found.The CAUSIDO(R) culture reduced LDL-cholesterol and increased fibrinogen in the overweight subjects at a 450 ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. The effect on LDL-cholesterol confirms previous studies.

Data were pooled using inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.Nineteen randomized trials (28 publications, 1412 participants) were included. There were no differences in mean body weight change [mean difference (MD), -0.54 kg; 95%CI, -1.09 to 0.01; I2 = 0%; moderate quality of evidence) or mean BMI change (MD, -0.19 kg/; 95%CI, -0.43 to 0.04; I2 = 51%; low quality of evidence) between groups who received  or synbiotics and control groups. Oral supplementation with  or synbiotics reduced mean waist circumference compared with control (MD, -0.82 cm; 95%CI, -1.43 to -0.21; I2 = 46%; low quality of evidence).The findings suggest that oral supplementation with  or synbiotics has a small effect to reduce waist circumference but no effect on body weight or BMI, although the quality of evidence is low to moderate. Therefore, the current evidence is not definitive. Large-scale trials are needed and may help to better inform clinical practice.PROSPERO registration number CRD42018075126.© The Author(s) 2019.

Macrophage responses elicited are dependent on tissue environment and the resulting cell subset, where homeostatic macrophages resemble the  macrophage subset and inflammatory macrophages resemble M1s.  can modulate macrophage function with outcome dependent on subset present. Using a THP-1 monocyte cell line-derived model of CD14high/low M1 and  macrophages, the aim of this study was to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of a panel of heat-killed probiotic bacteria and their secreted proteins on the subset-specific inflammatory marker profile of TNFα, IL-6 and NFκB. M1 and  cells were generated by differentiation of monocyte stable transfectants for high and low CD14 expression with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and vitamin D3, respectively, where the resulting CD14lo  and CD14hi M1s mimicked homeostatic and inflammatory mucosal macrophages. Subsets were stimulated by enteropathic lipopolysaccharides in the presence or absence of heat-killed (HK) or secreted proteins (SP) from a panel of probiotic bacteria. Regulation of cytokine expression was measured by ELISA and NFκB activity by reporter assay. HK  suppress CD14lo and augment CD14hi M1 and  production of TNFα whereas SPs augmented CD14hi M1 TNFα and were generally suppressive in the other subtypes.  macrophage IL-6 production was suppressed by both HK and SPs and differentially regulated in CD14lo and CD14hi M1s. NFκB activation failed to parallel the regulatory profiles for TNFα and IL-6 which is suggestive of probiotic bacteria exerting their regulatory effects on these cytokines in an NFκB-independent manner. In conclusion, HK and SP  differentially regulate macrophage cytokines and NFκB activation in a subset-dependent manner and suggest a cautionary approach to probiotic treatment of mucosal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23455449>Probiotic Bacillus amyloliquefaciens mediate M1 macrophage polarization in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages.</a></h2><p>Depending on the microenvironment, macrophages can acquire distinct functional phenotypes, referred to as classically activated M1 and . M1 macrophages are considered potent effector cells that kill intracellular pathogens, and  macrophages promote the resolution of wound healing. In this study, we are interested to know whether probiotic Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (Ba) can induce macrophages polarization. Real-time fluorescence PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression of IL-1β, iNOS, TNF-α and IL-6 genes for M1 macrophages was significantly increased at 1.5 h after probiotic Ba treatment compared to the probiotic Ba-free treatment (P < 0.01), whereas the expression of  macrophage marker genes (Arg1, Fizz1, MR, Ym1) was decreased (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the phagocytic activity was dramatically increased in the Ba-treated BMDMs using a FITC-dextran endocytosis assay. Together, these findings indicated that probiotic Ba facilitated polarization of M1 macrophages and enhanced its phagocytic capacity.

Our results showed that recombinant L. plantarum NC8-409-1 and NC8-409-2 could substantially stimulate the specific IgA titer in the intestine and the specific IgG antibody titer in the serum. We also found that recombinant L. plantarum induced increases in the number of B220 IgA cells in Peyer's patches (PPs), in lymphocyte proliferation and in the number of IFN-γ producing CD8 T cells after immunization in mice. Most importantly, the mice that were vaccinated with recombinant L. plantarum NC8-409-2 and NC8-409-1 were to some extent protected against infection challenge with the H9N2 and H1N1 viruses. In particular, NC8-409-2 provided up to 80% protection against the H9N2 virus, and NC8-409-1 provided up to 60% protection. Lung tissue pathology was also reduced. Therefore, recombinant L. plantarum NC8-409-2 and NC8-409-1 may be candidate oral vaccines against bird flu.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, we evaluated whether new therapeutic  have anti-colitic effects, and we investigated their mechanisms related to NF-κB and ER-stress pathways.Luciferase, nitric oxide, and cytokine assays using HT-29 or RAW264.7 cells were conducted. Mouse colitis was induced using dextran sulfate sodium and confirmed by disease activity index and histology. Macrophages and T-cell subsets in isolated peritoneal cavity cells and splenocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Gene and cytokine expression profiles were determined using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA1) and Pediococcus pentosaceus inhibited nitric oxide production in RAW264.7 cells, but only LA1 inhibited Tnfa and induced Il10 expression. LA1 increased the lifespan of dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice and attenuated the severity of colitis by inducing  macrophages in peritoneal cavity cells and Th2 and Treg cells in splenocytes. The restoration of goblet cells in the colon was accompanied by the induction of Il10 expression and the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, we found that LA1 exerts an anti-colitic effect by improving ER stress in HT-29 cells as well as in vivo.We showed that LA1 significantly interferes with ER stress and suppresses NF-κB activation. Our findings suggest that LA1 can be used as a potent immunomodulator in IBD treatment, and the regulation of ER stress may have significant implications in treating IBD.© 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30558320> KW3110 Prevents Blue Light-Induced Inflammation and Degeneration in the Retina.</a></h2><p>Age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa are leading causes of blindness and share a pathological feature, which is photoreceptor degeneration. To date, the lack of a potential treatment to prevent such diseases has raised great concern. Photoreceptor degeneration can be accelerated by excessive light exposure via an inflammatory response; therefore, anti-inflammatory agents would be candidates to prevent the progress of photoreceptor degeneration. We previously reported that a lactic acid bacterium,  KW3110 ( KW3110), activated macrophages suppressing inflammation in mice and humans. Recently, we also showed that intake of  KW3110 could mitigate visual display terminal (VDT) load-induced ocular disorders in humans. However, the biological mechanism of  KW3110 to retain visual function remains unclear. In this study, we found that  KW3110 activated  macrophages inducing anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in vitro using bone marrow-derived  macrophages. We also show that IL-10 gene expression was significantly increased in the intestinal immune tissues 6 h after oral administration of  KW3110 in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that intake of  KW3110 suppressed inflammation and photoreceptor degeneration in a murine model of light-induced retinopathy. These results suggest that  KW3110 may have a preventive effect against degrative retinal diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20854699>Fermentation of calcium-fortified soya milk does not appear to enhance acute calcium absorption in osteopenic post-menopausal women.</a></h2><p>Ageing women may choose to drink soya milk to reduce menopausal symptoms. As fermentation enriches soya milk with isoflavone aglycones, its beneficial qualities may improve. To reduce osteoporotic risk, however, soya milk must be Ca enriched, and it is not known how fermentation affects Ca bioavailability. A randomised crossover pilot study was undertaken to compare the Ca absorption of fortified soya milk with that of fermented and fortified soya milk in twelve Australian osteopenic post-menopausal women. The fortified soya milk was inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 4962 and fermented for 24 h at 37°C.

To investigate metabolism and functionality of two different batches of a probiotic blend commercialized under the same name in Europe in models of intestinal inflammation.  Boxes of VSL#3, a probiotic mixture used in the treatment of pouchitis, were obtained from pharmacies in UK subjected to metabolomic analysis and their functionality tested in mice rendered colitis by treatment with DSS or TNBS.  VSL#3-A (lot DM538), but not VSL#3-B (lot 507132), attenuated "clinical" signs of colitis in the DSS and TNBS models. In both models, VSL#3-A, but not VSL#3-B, reduced macroscopic scores, intestinal permeability, and expression of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNAs, while increased the expression of TGFβ and IL-10, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) mRNAs and shifted colonic macrophages from a M1 to  phenotype ( < 0.05 vs. TNBS). In contrast, VSL#3-B failed to reduce inflammation, and worsened intestinal permeability in the DSS model ( < 0.001 vs. VSL#3-A). A metabolomic analysis of the two formulations allowed the identification of two specific patterns, with at least three-folds enrichment in the concentrations of four metabolites, including 1-3 dihydroxyacetone (DHA), an intermediate in the fructose metabolism, in VSL#3-B supernatants. Feeding mice with DHA, increased intestinal permeability.  Two batches of a commercially available probiotic show divergent metabolic activities.

Among the LAB evaluated, Lactobacillus plantarum CLP-0611 inhibited the IL-1β and IL-6 expression, as well as the NF-κB and AP1 activation in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. Therefore, we investigated its inhibitory effect on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice. TNBS significantly induced colon shortening, as well as myeloperoxidase activity and macroscopic score. Oral administration of CLP-0611 significantly reduced TNBS-induced body weight loss, colon shortening, myeloperoxidase activity, IRAK-1 phosphorylation, NF-κB and MAP kinase (p38, ERK, JNK) activation, and iNOS and COX-2 expression. CLP-0611 also inhibited TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. However, IL-10 expression was induced. CLP-0611 also induced the production of  macrophage markers (IL-10, arginase I and CD206).

Macrophage polarization is responsible for a dichotomic approach (killing vs. repair) of the host response to bacteria; M1-type conditions are protective, whereas -type conditions are associated with bacterial persistence. The use of the polarization concept to classify the features of macrophage activation in infected patients using transcriptional and/or molecular data and to provide biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis has most often been unsuccessful. The confrontation of polarization with different clinical situations in which monocytes/macrophages encounter bacteria obliged us to reappraise this concept. With the exception of -type infectious diseases, such as leprosy and Whipple's disease, most acute (sepsis) or chronic (Q fever, tuberculosis) infectious diseases do not exhibit polarized monocytes/macrophages. This is also the case for commensals that shape the immune response and for  that alter the immune response independent of macrophage polarization. We propose that the type of myeloid cells (monocytes vs. macrophages) and the kinetics of the immune response (early vs. late responses) are critical variables for understanding macrophage activation in human infectious diseases. Explorating the role of these new markers will provide important tools to better understand complex macrophage physiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016744>[Comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of different schemes of correction the portal system pressure in patients with liver cirrhosis].</a></h2><p>The data about the complex examination and treatment of 64 patients is given.

Induction of proinflammatory pathways plays a crucial role in chronic inflammation, gastric carcinoma, and H. pylori pathogenesis. Herbal medicines (HMs) are nontoxic, inexpensive, and mostly anti-inflammatory reminding meticulous emphasis on the elimination of H. pylori and gastric cancer. Several HM has exerted paramount anti-H. pylori traits. In addition, they exert anti-inflammatory effects through several cellular circuits such as inhibition of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-κB, and activator protein-1 pathway activation leading to the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1α [IL-1α], IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, interferon γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α) expression. Furthermore, they inhibit nitrous oxide release and COX-2 and iNOS activity. The apoptosis induction in Th1 and Th17-polarized lymphocytes and -macrophagic polarization and STAT6 activation has also been exhibited. Thus, their exact consumable amount has not been revealed, and clinical trials are needed to achieve optimal concentration and their pharmacokinetics. In the aspect of bioavailability, solubility, absorption, and metabolism of herbal compounds, nanocarriers such as poly lactideco-glycolide-based loading and related formulations are helpful. Noticeably, combined therapies accompanied by  can also be examined for better clearance of gastric mucosa. In addition, downregulation of inflammatory microRNAs (miRNAs) by HMs and upregulation of those anti-inflammatory miRNAs is proposed to protect the gastric mucosa.

Microbial communities provide the enzymatic machinery and the metabolic pathways that contribute to food digestion, xenobiotic metabolism, and production of a variety of bioactive molecules. These include vitamins, amino acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and metabolites, which are essential for the interconnected pathways of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid/Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. Recent studies have been elucidating how nutrients that fuel the metabolic processes impact on the ways immune cells, in particular, macrophages, respond to different stimuli under physiological and pathological conditions and become activated and acquire a specialized function. The two major inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages are controlled through differential consumption of glucose, glutamine, and oxygen. M1 phenotype is triggered by polarization signal from bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Th1 proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-, TNF-, and IL-1, or both, whereas  phenotype is triggered by Th2 cytokines such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF, or glucocorticoids. Glucose utilization and production of chemical mediators including ATP, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and NADPH support effector activities of M1 macrophages. Dysbiosis is an imbalance of commensal and pathogenic bacteria and the production of microbial antigens and metabolites. It is now known that the gut microbiota-derived products induce low-grade inflammatory activation of tissue-resident macrophages and contribute to metabolic and degenerative diseases, including diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cancer.

This disease causes severe economic loss in many countries, and developing mucosal vaccines is an efficient strategy to control the influenza virus. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) plays an important role in transferring IgG across polarized epithelial cells. In the present study, an oral vaccine was developed using Lactobacillus plantarum to deliver the internal influenza viral protein M2e fused to an IgG Fc fragment. Oral vaccination with recombinant L. plantarum expressing 3M2e-Fc elicited Peyer's patch (PP) DC activation, improved the number of gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-producing T cells and increased the frequency of CD8IFN-γ cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). In addition, the recombinant L. plantarum can induce PP B220IgA expression and enhance specific sIgA secretion and the shaping of growth centers (GCs) in PPs. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that immunization with recombinant L. plantarum expressing 3M2e-Fc markedly reduced the viral load in the lung and protected against H1N1 influenza virus and mouse-adapted H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) challenge in BALB/c mice. Collectively, the data also showed that this vaccine strategy provided effective protective immunity against infection with homologous and heterologous influenza viruses in a mouse model and may be useful for future influenza vaccine development.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Forty-one healthy sedentary overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25-29.9 kg/) and obese (BMI ≥30) volunteers, aged 30-65 y and low consumers of fruit and vegetables, ate 1 serving/d of whole-grain control (CTR) or innovative (INN) pasta for 12 wk and maintained their habitual diets. Biological samples were collected at baseline and every 4 wk for primary (plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP] and fasting plasma lipid profile) and secondary outcomes (glycemia-related markers, blood pressure, fecal microbiota composition, and body weight). Between (CTR compared with INN) and within (among weeks) group differences were tested for the whole population and for subgroups stratified by baseline values of BMI (≥30) and glycemia (≥100 mg/dL).INN or CTR pasta consumption had no effect on primary and secondary outcomes over time, except for a significant increase in plasma γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) after 12 wk of CTR pasta consumption. Comparisons between intervention groups revealed differences only at 12 wk: plasma GGT was higher in the CTR group; plasma hs-CRP, plasma LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, and Bifidobacterium spp. were lower in the INN subgroup of obese volunteers; plasma resistin was lower and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance was higher in the INN subgroup of hyperglycemic volunteers.A daily serving of a synbiotic whole-grain pasta had limited effects on primary and secondary outcomes in the entire group of volunteers but affected glycemia- and lipid-related markers and resistin in a subgroup of healthy obese or hyperglycemic volunteers.

This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and possible mechanisms of Lactobacillus paracasei on NASH.Thirty male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into three groups and maintained for 10 weeks: control group (standard chow), NASH model group (high fat + 10 % fructose diet), and the L. paracasei group (NASH model with L. paracasei). Liver histology, serum aminotransferase levels, and hepatic gene expression levels were measured. Intestinal permeability was investigated using urinary (51)Creatinine Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) clearance. Total Kupffer cell counts and their composition (M1 vs.  Kupffer cells) were measured using flow cytometry with F4/80 and CD206 antibodies.Hepatic fat deposition, serum ALT level, and (51)Cr-EDTA clearance were significantly lower in the L. paracasei group than the NASH group (p < 0.05). The L. paracasei group had lower expression in Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX-4), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin 4 (IL-4), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), and PPAR-δ compared with the NASH group (p < 0.05). The total number of F4/80(+) Kupffer cells was lower in the L. paracasei group than the NASH group. L. paracasei induced the fraction of F4/80(+)CD206(+) cells ( Kupffer cells) while F4/80(+)CD206(-) cells (M1 Kupffer cells) were higher in the NASH group (F4/80(+)CD206(+) cell: 44% in NASH model group vs. 62% in L. paracasei group, p < 0.05).Lactobacillus paracasei attenuates hepatic steatosis with -dominant Kupffer cell polarization in a NASH model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653264>Helminth infection in mice improves insulin sensitivity via modulation of gut microbiota and fatty acid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Intestinal helminths are prevalent in individuals who live in rural areas of developing countries, where obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are rare. In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to  pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with . Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of oleic acid, which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated whether prebiotic and probiotic supplementation along with low protein diet retards the progression of CKD.This is a 12-month prospective observation study with a randomized control and open-label design. A total of 24 stable CKD stage III to V patients, who are not on renal replacement therapy, were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: low protein diet + prebiotic + probiotic supplementation (N.=12), receiving 3 tablets of prebiotic + probiotic supplementation daily for 6 months, and the control group receiving low protein diet only (N.=12). We examined the effects of prebiotic and probiotic supplementation on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in CKD.The declining GFR during prebiotic and probiotic supplementation were significantly lower (-11.6±8.6 vs. -3.4±4.6 mL/min per 1.73  per year, 95% CI -6.45 - -9.86, P<0.001) than those with low protein diet alone.Prebiotic and probiotic supplementation along with low protein diet delayed the progression of CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17995771>Alginate- and gellan-based edible films for probiotic coatings on fresh-cut fruits.</a></h2><p>Alginate- (2% w/v) or gellan-based (0.5%) edible films, containing glycerol (0.6% to 2.0%), N-acetylcysteine (1%), and/or ascorbic acid (1%) and citric acid (1%), were formulated and used to coat fresh-cut apple and papaya cylinders. Water vapor permeability (WVP) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in alginate films (0.30 to 0.31 x 10(-9) g m/Pa s ) than in the gellan ones (0.26 to 0.27 x 10(-9) g m/Pa s ). Addition of 0.025% (w/v) sunflower oil decreased WVP of gellan films (0.20 to 0.22 x 10(-9) g m/Pa s ). Water solubility of gellan and alginate films at 25 degrees C (0.47 to 0.59 and 0.74 to 0.79, respectively) and their swelling ratios (2.3 to 2.6 and 1.6 to 2.0, respectively) indicate their potential for coating high moisture fresh-cut fruits. Fresh-cut apple and papaya cylinders were successfully coated with 2% (w/v) alginate or gellan film-forming solutions containing viable bifidobacteria. WVP in alginate (6.31 and 5.52 x 10(-9) g m/Pa s ) or gellan (3.65 and 4.89 x 10(-9) g m/Pa s ) probiotic coatings of papaya and apple, respectively, were higher than in the corresponding cast films. The gellan coatings and films exhibited better water vapor properties in comparison with the alginate coatings. Values > 10(6) CFU/g B. lactis Bb-12 were maintained for 10 d during refrigerated storage of fresh-cut fruits, demonstrating the feasibility of alginate- and gellan-based edible coatings to carry and support viable  on fresh-cut fruit.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657159>Lactobacillus pentosus var. plantarum C29 ameliorates memory impairment and inflammaging in a D-galactose-induced accelerated aging mouse model.</a></h2><p>Aging is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), cardiovascular disease and cancer. Oxidative stress is considered as a major factor that accelerates the aging process. To understand the ability of lactic acid bacteria to ameliorate memory impairment caused by aging, we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus pentosus var. plantarum (C29), which is known to protect against scopolamine-induced memory impairment, on oxidative stress (D-galactose)-induced memory impairment in mice. D-Galactose was subcutaneously injected to 20-week old male C57BL/6J mice for 10 weeks, with oral administration of C29 for the final 5 weeks. Excessive intake of D-galactose not only impaired memory, which was indicated by passive avoidance, Y-maze, and Morris water-maze tasks, but also reduced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and hippocampal doublecortin (DCX) and the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). C29 treatment ameliorated D-galactose-induced memory impairment and reversed the suppression of BDNF and DCX expression and CREB activation. Moreover, C29 decreased the expression of a senescence marker p16 and inflammation markers p-p65, p-FOXO3a, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and inducible NO synthase (iNOS). C29 treatment inhibited D-galactose-induced expression of M1 polarization markers tumor necrosis factor-α and arginase II, and attenuated the d-galactose-suppressed expression of  markers IL-10, arginase I and CD206. Taken together, these findings suggest that C29 may ameliorate memory impairment and M1 macrophage-polarized inflammation caused by aging.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials Methods: Sixty patients undergoing LSG were recruited to participate in the study and randomized into either a LactoWise® or placebo group. The LactoWise® group (LWG) received 4.5 billion live cells of bacillus coagulans and galactomannans (300 mg); the placebo group received 600 mg of calcium citrate yielding 126 mg of elemental calcium. Both groups took their assigned capsule daily for 3-months post-surgery. Standard clinical lab values were measured pre-surgery and at 3-months post-surgery. Weight and blood pressures were measured at baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months post-surgery.A total of 35 patients with a mean age of 47.7±12.4 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 46.6±8.2 kg/ completed the study. There was a significant difference in BMI at baseline between the two study groups (43.0±7.0 vs. 49.2±8.3, p=0.02). Weight loss was greater in the LWG compared to placebo at 6 weeks but showed no significant difference at 3 months post-op. In addition, there was a significant drop in triglycerides (TG) (p=0.02) over time in the LWG (p=0.01). The LWG had a significant decrease in AST and LDL compared to the placebo group (p=0.03).Bariatric surgery (BS) produces positively impacting metabolic results in morbidly obese patients. Our study shows that in the case of triglycerides, LDL, weight loss and AST, administering of a probiotic/prebiotic blend may play a role in improving clinical outcomes of morbidly obese patients undergoing LSG.</p></html>
