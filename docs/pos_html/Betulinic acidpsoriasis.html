(Dilleniaceae) is traditionally used to treat skin inflammation.This study evaluated the healing effect of Dillenia indica fruit extracts on induced -like wounds in Wistar rats.Extracts were standardized to , including an aqueous ethanolic extract (AEE), ethyl acetate extract (EAE) and petroleum ether extract. Effects against lipid peroxidation were assessed in vitro. Wounds were created at rat tails (n = 12). Topical treatments were applied once daily for 7 days (1 mL of AEE or EAE at 5 or 50 mg/mL). Maximal dose was defined by the extract solubility. A 10-fold lower dose was also tested. Positive and negative controls were treated with clobetasol (0.5 mg/mL) or excipient. Half of each group was euthanized for histology. The remaining animals were observed for 20 days for wound measurements.Yields of AEE and EAE were 4.3 and 0.7%, respectively.  concentrations in AEE and EAE were 4.6 and 107.6 mg/g. Extracts neutralized lipid peroxidation in vitro at 0.02 μg/mL, accelerating healing at 50 mg/mL. Complete healing in mice treated with AEE occurred 16 days after wound induction. This time was 14 and 12 days in mice treated with EAE and clobetasol. Compared to orthokeratosis, parakeratosis was reduced by AEE (25%), EAE (45%) and clobetasol (55%). EAE caused superior protection against biomolecules oxidation of skin compared to AEE.EAE exhibited activity closer to that of clobetasol.  may be an active constituent, which should be assessed in future studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129421> suppresses Th17 response and ameliorates -like murine skin inflammation.</a></h1><p> is a common inflammatory skin disease. Current treatment for  relies on conventional immunosuppressive agents. However, long-term treatment with global immunosuppression may cause various side effects. Thus, it is compelling to seek alternative drugs for treating  with potentially less side effects.  (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene, an ingredient that originally exists in natural plants and lacks systemic toxicity. BA can regulate immunity with anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, it's unknown whether BA has a therapeutic effect on . The objectives of this study were to investigate whether BA attenuates psoriatic skin inflammation and to identify its mechanisms of action. A murine model of imiquimod-induced  was utilized to evaluate skin lesion while flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses were performed for immunoassays. We found that BA treatment alleviated psoriatic symptoms and inflammatory skin lesion. BA lowered the PASI scores, decreased epidermal thickness and reduced T cell infiltration in the skin lesion. Moreover, BA reduced the frequency of IL-17A-expressing CD4 and γδ T cells in psoriatic mice, but did not alter CD4FoxP3 Treg frequency. BA also reduced IL-17A production but increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level in serum of the psoriatic mice. Furthermore, BA inhibited gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in skin lesions, including RORγt, IL-17A, IL-6 and TNFα. Importantly, it suppressed NFκB signaling in the skin lesion. Finally, BA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-17A production by CD4 T-Cells in vitro. Thus, BA attenuates  and inhibits Th17 development.Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.</p></html>
