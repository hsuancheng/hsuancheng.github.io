The use of various types of mouthrinses plays an important role in maintaining proper oral hygiene and in removing some of the microbial components from the oral cavity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of selected mouthrinses on the reference strains of Trichomonas tenax and Entamoeba gingivalis which can be a part of the oral cavity . Two standard strains Trichomonas tenax (ATCC 30207) and Entamoeba gingivalis (ATCC 30927) were used and metronidazole as a drug used in the treatment of infections caused by protozoa as well as fourteen agents used as mouthwashes were tested, with two pure compounds acting as mouthrinse ingredients, i.e. 20% benzocaine and 0.2% chlorhexidine, as well as 12 commercially-available formulas: Azulan, Colgate Plax Complete Care Sensitive, Corsodyl 0.2%, Curasept ADS 205, Dentosept, Dentosept A, Eludril Classic, Listerine Total Care, Octenidol, Oral- Pro-Expert Clinic Line, Sylveco and Tinctura salviae. The protozoonicidal activity of the preparations was evaluated on the basis of the ratio of dead to living ratios after incubation in an incubator (37°C) for 1, 10 and 30 min. Protozoa were counted in the ürker chamber in each case up to 100 cells in an optical microscope (over 400×). The criterion for the death of protozoa was the lack of movement and changes in the shape and characteristics of cell disintegration. The curves of activity were obtained after experiments conducted for 5–7 different solutions of each preparation. On the basis of the curves, the solution killing 50% of the population (CL50) was calculated. All mouthrinses tested in this work in their undiluted form acted lethally on both protozoa. Benzocaine, used as a local anesthetic, has etiotropic properties which can be useful for supporting antiprotozoal treatment. Chlorhexidine confirmed its high efficiency in the eradication of potentially pathogenic protozoa. The use of mouthrinses is an important complement for other procedures intended to maintain correct oral hygiene.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670358>Effect of supplementation of nicotinamide and sodium butyrate on the growth performance, liver mitochondrial function and gut  of broilers at high stocking density.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to investigate the effects of stocking density and dietary nicotinamide (NAM) and butyrate sodium (BA) supplementation on the growth performance, liver mitochondrial function and gut  of broilers at high stocking density. A total of 342, 26-d-old Cobb500 broilers were divided into 5 groups with 6 replicates. Treatments were as follows: (a) Low stocking density (L, 9 birds per cage); () High stocking density (H, 12 birds per cage); (c) H + 50 ppm NAM; (d) H + 500 ppm BA; (e) H + 50 ppm NAM + 500 ppm BA (COMB). The results showed that high stocking density significantly reduced the feed intake and body weight gain of broilers, while COMB improved the growth performance at high stocking density. High stocking density significantly reduced the liver metallothionein content, liver mitochondrial membrane potential and the activities of Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase. In contrast, the liver metallothionein contents in the NAM, BA and COMB fed group were higher than those in the H group. COMB increased the activity of ATPase as well, but it failed to enhance the mitochondrial membrane potential. Stocking density also affected gut  of broilers. The high-density group increased the relative abundance of Blautia. Supplementation of BA and NAM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, respectively. In conclusion, a combination of NAM and BA can improve the performance, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function and intestinal  of broilers at high stocking density.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541115>Understanding pseudo-albinism in sole (Solea senegalensis): a transcriptomics and metagenomics approach.</a></h2><p>Pseudo-albinism is a pigmentation disorder observed in flatfish aquaculture with a complex, multi-factor aetiology. We tested the hypothesis that pigmentation abnormalities are an overt signal of more generalised modifications in tissue structure and function, using as a model the Senegalese sole and two important innate immune barriers, the skin and intestine, and their microbiomes. Stereological analyses in pseudo-albino sole revealed a significantly increased mucous cell number in skin (P < 0.001) and a significantly thicker muscle layer and lamina propria in gut (P < 0.001). RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of the skin and gut identified 573 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs, FDR < 0.05) between pseudo-albino and pigmented soles (one pool/tissue from 4 individuals/phenotype). DETs were mainly linked to pigment production, skin structure and regeneration and smooth muscle contraction. The  (16 S rRNA analysis) was highly diverse in pigmented and pseudo-albino skin but in gut had low complexity and diverged between the two pigmentation phenotypes. Quantitative PCR revealed significantly lower loads of Mycoplasma (P < 0.05) and Vibrio bacteria (P < 0.01) in pseudo-albino compared to the control. The study revealed that pseudo-albinism in addition to pigmentation changes was associated with generalised changes in the skin and gut structure and a modification in the gut .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531343>Effect of Chronic Consumption of Sweeteners on  and Immunity in the Small Intestine of Young Mice.</a></h2><p>The consumption of sweeteners has increased as a measure to reduce the consumption of calories and thus combat obesity and diabetes. Sweeteners are found in a large number of products, so chronic consumption has been little explored. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of chronic sweetener consumption on the  and immunity of the small intestine in young mice. We used 72 CD1 mice of 21 days old, divided into 3 groups: (i) No treatment, (ii) Group A (6 weeks of treatment), and (iii) Group  (12 weeks of treatment). Groups A and  were divided into 4 subgroups: Control (CL), Sucrose (Suc), Splenda® (Spl), and Svetia® (Sv). The following were determined: anthropometric parameters, percentage of lymphocytes of Peyer's patches and lamina propria, IL-6, IL-17, leptin, resistin, C-peptide, and TNF-. From feces, the  of the small intestine was identified. The BMI was not modified; the mice preferred the consumption of Splenda® and Svetia®. The percentage of CD3 lymphocytes in Peyer's patches was increased. In the lamina propria, Svetia® increased the percentage of CD3 lymphocytes, but Splenda® decreases it. The Splenda® and Svetia® subgroups elevate leptin, C-peptide, IL-6, and IL-17, with reduction of resistin. The predominant genus in all groups was . The chronic consumption of sweeteners increases the population of lymphocytes in the mucosa of the small intestine.

C. Ma. and its bioactivity on intestinal bacteria strains.</a></h2><p>To understand whether polysaccharides may have impact on gut , a neutral polysaccharide CDA-0.05 with an average molecular weight of 7.96 kDa was obtained from Cistanche deserticola Y. C. Ma. The monosaccharide composition analysis indicated that CDA-0.05 was composed of glucose and galactose in a molar ratio of 96.4: 3.6. The backbone of CDA-0.05 contained 1, 4-linked α-D-Glcp, 1, 4, 6-linked α-D-Glcp and 1, 4-linked β-D-Galp, with branches of T-linked α-D-Glcp attached at C-6 of 1, 4, 6-linked α-D-Glcp residues. Bioactivity test results suggested that CDA-0.05 could promote the growth of three species of Bacteroides (. thetaiotaomicron, . ovatus and . fragilis) significantly. Furthermore, CDA-0.05 could also promote some probiotics growth, such as Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus reuteri. These results suggested that CDA-0.05 might help to maintain intestinal homeostasis and could be recommended as part of fibers or drugs candidate to benefit human body by regulating gut bacteria.Copyright © 2019.

Accurate diagnosis is essential for management. In recent years, data from oral food challenges have revealed that routine allergy testing is poor at predicting clinical allergy for tree nuts, almonds in particular. More advanced antigen-based tests including component-resolved diagnostics and epitope reactivity may lead to more accurate diagnosis and selection of therapeutic intervention. Additional diagnostic accuracy may come from cellular tests such as the basophil activation test or mast cell approaches. In the context of clinical trials, cellular tests have revealed specific T-cell and -cell populations that are more abundant in food-allergic individuals with distinct mechanistic features. Awareness of clinical markers, such as the ability to eat baked forms of milk and egg, continues to inform the understanding of natural tolerance development. Mouse models have allowed for investigation into multiple mechanisms of food allergy including modification of epithelial metabolism, and the induction of regulatory cell subsets and the . Increasing numbers of children who underwent food immunotherapy enlarged the body of evidence on mechanisms and predictors of treatment success. Experimental immunological markers in conjunction with clinical determinants such as lower age and lower initial specific IgE appear to be of benefit. More research on the optimal dose, preparation, and route of application integrating a high-level safety and efficacy is demanded. Alternatively, biologics blocking TSLP, IL-33, IL-4 and IL-13, or IgE may help to achieve that.© 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Cholera toxin  (CTB) is a mucosal adjuvant that can induce antigen tolerance. Bacillus subtilis spores are an ideal vehicle for the oral delivery of heterologous antigens.We investigated the therapeutic effect of recombinant NAP  subtilis spores on peanut allergies in a mouse model.Female C3H/HeJ mice were sensitized and challenged with peanut extract by oral administration. Before challenge, recombinant NAP and CTB-NAP (CNAP) spores were orally administered to sensitized mice for 4 weeks. Faecal peanut-specific IgA and serum-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a levels were measured, and the intestinal  was analysed. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with anti-CD25 antibodies for regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion to evaluate the efficacy of Tregs in preventing peanut allergy. After challenge, anaphylactic reactions, plasma histamine, Tregs, and splenocyte interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, IL-5 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels were evaluated.After 4 weeks of recombinant spore treatment, faecal IgA levels and serum IgG2a levels were increased, while serum IgG1 and IgE levels were reduced. Intestinal  analysis revealed that CNAP spores increased the taxonomic abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum level and Clostridia at the class level. After challenge, the administration of NAP or CNAP spores to mice was found to ameliorate anaphylactic reactions and decrease plasma histamine levels. Administration of NAP or CNAP spores also enhanced IL-10 and IFN-γ secretion, and suppressed IL-4 and IL-5 secretion. The protective effect of CNAP spores was more pronounced than that of NAP spores; this therapeutic effect was lost after Treg depletion.Recombinant NAP spores successfully suppressed Th2 inflammation via the up-regulation of Tregs; this may serve as a novel therapeutic approach for treating food allergies.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450384>Bacterial control and structural and physicochemical modification of bovine Longissimus dorsi by ultrasound.</a></h2><p>A multifactorial study to evaluate the effect of three ultrasound intensities (16, 28 and 90 Wcm), two sonication times (20 and 40 min), and two storage times (0 and 7 days at 4 °C) on physicochemical properties, microbiological counts, and microstructure of bovine Longissimus dorsi was performed. The results showed that ultrasound (US) did not modify luminosity (P = 0.42), redness (a*, P = 0.45), or yellowness (*, P = 0.94).

The length of these symbiont-host associations may be thousands to millions of years, and while symbiont loss is predicted, there have been very few observations of a decline of symbiont infection rates. In a population of the sweet potato whitefly species (Bemisia tabaci MEAM1) in Arizona, USA, we documented the frequency decline of a strain of Rickettsia in the Rickettsia bellii clade from near-fixation in 2011 to 36% of whiteflies infected in 2017. In previous studies, Rickettsia had been shown to increase from 1 to 97% from 2000 to 2006 and remained at high frequency for at least five years. At that time, Rickettsia infection was associated with both fitness benefits and female bias. In the current study, we established matrilines of whiteflies from the field (2016, Rickettsia infection frequency = 58%) and studied (a) Rickettsia vertical transmission, () fitness and sex ratios associated with Rickettsia infection, (c) symbiont titer, and (d) bacterial communities within whiteflies. The vertical transmission rate was high, approximately 98%. Rickettsia infection in the matrilines was not associated with fitness benefits or sex ratio bias and appeared to be slightly costly, as more Rickettsia-infected individuals produced non-hatching eggs. Overall, the titer of Rickettsia in the matrilines was lower in 2016 than in the whiteflies collected in 2011, but the titer distribution appeared bimodal, with high- and low-titer lines, and constancy of the average titer within lines over three generations. We found neither association between Rickettsia titer and fitness benefits or sex ratio bias nor evidence that Rickettsia was replaced by another secondary symbiont. The change in the interaction between symbiont and host in 2016 whiteflies may explain the drop in symbiont frequency we observed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417554>Dietary Oligosaccharides Attenuate Stress-Induced Disruptions in Immune Reactivity and Microbial -Vitamin Metabolism.</a></h2><p> Exposure to stressful stimuli dysregulates inflammatory processes and alters the gut . Prebiotics, including long-chain fermentable fibers and milk oligosaccharides, have the potential to limit inflammation through modulation of the gut . To determine whether prebiotics attenuate stress-induced inflammation and  perturbations, mice were fed either a control diet or a diet supplemented with galactooligosaccharides, polydextrose and sialyllactose (GOS+PDX+SL) or sialyllactose (SL) for 2 weeks prior to and during a 6-day exposure to a social disruption stressor. Spleens were collected for immunoreactivity assays. Colon contents were examined for stressor- and diet- induced changes in the gut  and metabolome through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing and UPLC-MS/MS.  Stress increased circulating IL-6 and enhanced splenocyte immunoreactivity to an  LPS challenge. Diets containing GOS+PDX+SL or SL alone attenuated these responses. Stress exposure resulted in large changes to the gut metabolome, including robust shifts in amino acids, peptides, nucleotides/nucleosides, tryptophan metabolites, and  vitamins. Multiple  vitamins were inversely associated with IL-6 and were augmented in mice fed either GOS+PDX+SL or SL diets. Stressed mice exhibited distinct microbial communities with lower abundances of  spp. and higher abundances of  spp. Diet supplementation with GOS+PDX+SL, but not SL alone, orthogonally altered the  and enhanced the growth of  spp. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from mice fed the GOS+PDX+SL diet unveiled genes in a  MAG for   vitamin synthesis.  vitamers directly attenuated the stressor-induced exacerbation of cytokine production in LPS-stimulated splenocytes.  Overall, these data indicate that colonic metabolites, including  vitamins, are responsive to psychosocial stress.

Gut  is closely interrelated with intestinal mucosal immunity, but the effects and mechanisms of taurine on intestinal  and mucosal immune cells under an immunosuppressive condition remain unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of taurine on gut  and immune cells in Peyer's patches (PPs) of dexamethasone (Dex)-induced immunosuppressive mice. Mice (4-week-old, Male) were randomly divided into three groups: the Control group (n = 12), the Dex-induced immunosuppressive model group (n = 12) and the taurine intervention group (n = 12). The model was established by Dex injection for 7 days and the taurine intervention group was gavaged 100 mg/kg soluble taurine for 30 days. The changes of intestinal  and immune cells in PPs were tested by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and flow cytometry, respectively. Results showed that the  in immunosuppressive mice was obvious different compared with control group, in which, the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae groups were significantly reduced, and their reduction were reversed after taurine intervention. Compared to the control group, the total cell number in PPs, as well as the subsets of CD3 cells (T cells), CD19 cells ( cells) in model groups were significantly lower, and they were dramatically improved after taurine treatment.

A firm connection between melatonin at a physiologically relevant concentration and the gut  and inflammation has recently established. Herein, we summarize their crosstalk and focus on four novelties. First, how melatonin is synthesized and degraded in the gut and exerts potentially diverse phenotypic effects through its diverse metabolites. Second, how melatonin mediates the activation and proliferation of intestinal mucosal immune cells with paracrine and autocrine properties. By modulating T/ cells, mast cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, melatonin immunomodulatory involved in regulating T-cell differentiation, intervening T/ cell interaction and attenuating the production of pro-inflammatory factors, achieving its antioxidant action via specific receptors. Third, how melatonin exerts antimicrobial action and modulates microbial components, such as lipopolysaccharide, amyloid-β peptides via nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ) or signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1) pathway to modulate intestinal immune function in immune-pineal axis. The last, how melatonin mediates the effect of intestinal bacterial activity signals on the body rhythm system through the NF-κ pathway and influences the mucosal epithelium oscillation via clock gene expression. These processes are achieved at mitochondrial and nuclear levels to control the host immune cell development. Considering unclear mechanisms and undiscovered actions of melatonin in gut--immune axis, it's time to reveal them and provide new insight for the outlook of melatonin as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment and management of intestinal diseases.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649646>Microbial Metabolic Capacity for Intestinal Folate Production and Modulation of Host Folate Receptors.</a></h2><p>Microbial metabolites, including  complex vitamins contribute to diverse aspects of human health. Folate, or vitamin , refers to a broad category of biomolecules that include pterin, para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), and glutamate subunits. Folates are required for DNA synthesis and epigenetic regulation. In addition to dietary nutrients, the gut  has been recognized as a source of  complex vitamins, including folate. This study evaluated the predicted folate synthesis capabilities in the genomes of human commensal microbes identified in the Human  Project and folate production by representative strains of six human intestinal bacterial phyla. Bacterial folate synthesis genes were ubiquitous across 512 gastrointestinal reference genomes with 13% of the genomes containing all genes required for complete  folate synthesis. An additional 39% of the genomes had the genetic capacity to synthesize folates in the presence of pABA, an upstream intermediate that can be obtained through diet or from other intestinal microbes. Bacterial folate synthesis was assessed during exponential and stationary phase growth through the evaluation of expression of select folate synthesis genes, quantification of total folate production, and analysis of folate polyglutamylation. Increased expression of key folate synthesis genes was apparent in exponential phase, and increased folate polyglutamylation occurred during late stationary phase. Of the folate producers, we focused on the commensal  to examine host-microbe interactions in relation to folate and examined folate receptors in the physiologically relevant human enteroid model. RNAseq data revealed segment-specific folate receptor distribution. Treatment of human colonoid monolayers with conditioned media (CM) from wild-type  did not influence the expression of key folate transporters proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) or reduced folate carrier (RFC). However, CM from  containing a site-specific inactivation of the  gene, which prevents the bacteria from synthesizing a polyglutamate tail on folate, significantly upregulated RFC expression. No effects were observed using  with a site inactivation of , which results in no folate production. This work sheds light on the contributions of microbial folate to overall folate status and mammalian host metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Engevik, Morra, Röth, Engevik, Spinler, Devaraj, Crawford, Estes, Kalkum and Versalovic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588707>Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated, NF-kB-, miRNA-146a- and miRNA-155-mediated molecular-genetic communication between the human gastrointestinal tract  and the brain.</a></h2><p>Through the use of RNA sequencing, microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) microfluidic array analysis, LED Northern, Western and ELISA analysis and multiple bioinformatics algorithms we have discovered a novel route for pathogenic communication between the human gastrointestinal (GI)-tract  and the brain. The evidence suggests that this pathogenic gut-brain circuit involves: (i) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the GI-tract resident enterotoxigenic Gram-negative bacteria Bacteroides fragilis (BF-LPS); (ii) LPS transit across the GI-tract barrier into the systemic circulation; (iii) transport of a highly pro-inflammatory systemic BF-LPS across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the brain-parenchyma and neuronal-cytoplasm; (iv) activation and signaling via the pro-inflammatory NF-kB (p50/p65) transcription-factor complex; (v) NF-kB-coupling and significant up-regulation of the inducible pro-inflammatory microRNA-146a (miRNA-146a) and microRNA-155 (miRNA-155); each containing multiple NF-kB DNA-binding and activation sites in their immediate promoters; and (vi) subsequent down-regulation of miRNA-146a-miRNA-155 regulated mRNA targets such as that encoding complement factor H (CFH), a soluble complement control glycoprotein and key repressor of the innate-immune response. Down-regulated CFH expression activates the complement-system, the major non-cellular component of the innate-immune system while propagating neuro-inflammation. Other GI-tract microbes and their highly complex pro-inflammatory exudates may contribute to this pathogenic GI-tract-brain pathway. We speculate that it may be significant that the first Gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species intensively studied as a potential contributor to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), that being the bacillus Bacteroides fragilis appears to utilize damaged or leaky physiological barriers and an activated NF-kB (p50-p65) - pro-inflammatory miRNA-146a-miRNA-155 signaling circuit to convey -derived pathogenic signals into the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446081>Effluent containing Rubrivivax gelatinosus promoting the yield, digestion system, disease resistance, mTOR and NF-kB signaling pathway, intestinal  and aquaculture water quality of crucian carp.</a></h2><p>The employment of traditional bait and medicament in freshwater aquaculture causes the frequent occurrence of environmental pollution and disease. Effluent collected after Rubrivivax gelatinosus-mediated wastewater treatment could be re-utilized as microbial feeds, medicament, and aquaculture water to culture Crucian carp. Therefore, a novel integrated system of wastewater treatment using effluent containing R. gelatinosus that improves yield, increases disease resistance, and enhances the quality of aquaculture water for Crucian carp culture was proposed and investigated. Crucian carp can grow well in effluent containing R. gelatinosus (ER). The survival rate, yield, and whole body composition of the ER group were all increased compared to the control group (CK). The biochemical ( vitamin) and other substances in the effluent of R. gelatinosus enhanced the activity of proteases, amylases, lipases, AKP, ACP, phagocytic, SOD, CAT by up-regulating the expression of akp, acp, sod, and cat genes. Theoretical analysis showed that biochemicals regulate the expression of these gene and enzyme activities by acting as a signal that stimulates the active center. Moreover, R. gelatinosus and biochemical substances improved mTOR and NF-kB signaling pathway and intestinal . Furthermore, R. gelatinosus inhibited Aeromonas hydrophila that increases resistance against fish disease and promotes the growth of intestinal bacteria. Meanwhile, R. gelatinosus in the effluent also improved the aquaculture water quality. This technology would save the aquaculture water, reduce water pollution and wastewater discharge, and increase the output and disease resistance of Crucian carp, simultaneously.Copyright © 2019.

The piglets were randomly allocated into three iso-nitrogenous diet groups that were fed either a control diet, a diet with 15% RDP, or a diet with 30% RDP for a total of 35 days. Chromium oxide was used for apparent digestibility measurements. On d14 and d35, half of the piglets were randomly selected for hemato-biochemical and gut  evaluations.Increasing inclusion levels of RDP tended to linearly increase (p ≤ 0.07) average daily gain on d14 and d35, and decreased (p = 0.08) feed conversion ratio on d35. Empty stomach weight increased (p = 0.04) on d35 while digestibility of diet components decreased. Serum globulin concentration decreased on d14 (P = 0.003) and red blood cell count tended to decrease (P = 0.06) on d35, parallel to increase RDP levels. Gene amplicon profiling of 16S rRNA revealed that the colonic  composition of weaned pigs changed by inclusion of RDP over the period. On d14, decreased proportions of Lachnospiraceae_ge, Ruminococcaceae_ge, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, and Bacteroidales_ge, and increased proportions of Prevotellaceae_ge, Prevotella_2, and Prevotella_9 were found with inclusion of RDP, whereas opposite effect was found on d35. Additionally, the proportion of Lachnospiraceae_ge, Ruminococcaceae_ge, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, and Bacteroidales_ge in RDP diets decreased over periods in control diet but increased largely in diet with 30% RDP.These results indicate that RDP modulates in a favorable way gastrointestinal  composition and improves piglet performance despite a negative impact on digestibility of lipids and GE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500822>MAIT cells in metabolic diseases.</a></h2><p>Metabolic diseases represent a wide category of alterations affecting metabolism. These pathologies are notably marked by inflammation that implicates the immune system. Mucosal Associated Invariant (MAI)T cells are immune cells expressing a semi-invariant TCR able to recognize bacterial and fungal vitamin  metabolites. MAIT cells can promote inflammation and are present in many organs central to metabolism, suggesting a role in the etiopathology of these diseases.Here, we will review what is known of the involvement of MAIT cells in metabolic pathologies in humans and mice.MAIT cells are severely affected, overactivated with a frequency reduction and a phenotype shift from protective to deleterious. Therefore, they might be a novel target to treat, in particular, pancreas and liver metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, this drug combination might be of therapeutic benefit in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. However, there is concern regarding the safety of statins in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. We assessed the safety of two different doses of simvastatin, in combination with rifaximin, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.We did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and moderate-to-severe liver failure from nine university hospitals in six European countries (Italy, France, Holland, Germany, the UK, and Spain). Patients older than 18 years with Child-Pugh class  or C disease were eligible. We randomly assigned patients (1:1:1) to receive either simvastatin 40 mg/day plus rifaximin 1200 mg/day, simvastatin 20 mg/day plus rifaximin 1200 mg/day, or placebo of both medications for 12 weeks. Randomisation was stratified according to Child-Pugh class ( vs C) and restricted using blocks of multiples of three. The primary endpoint was development of liver or muscle toxicity, as defined by changes in liver aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), alkaline phosphastase, and creatine kinase. The study is registered with the European Union Clinical Trials Register, 2016-004499-23, and with ClinicalTrials.gov, .The study recruitment period was between July 28, 2017, and Jan 2, 2018. Follow-up finished on March 12, 2018. 50 patients were randomly assigned to simvastatin 40 mg/day plus rifaximin 1200 mg/day (n=18), simvastatin 20 mg/day plus rifaximin 1200 mg/day (n=16), or placebo of both medications (n=16). Six patients (two from each group) were excluded. Therefore, the full analysis set included 44 patients (16 in the simvastatin 40 mg/day plus rifaximin 1200 mg/day group, 14 in the simvastatin 20 mg/day plus rifaximin mg/day group, and 14 in the placebo group). After a safety analyses when the first ten patients completed treatment, treatment was stopped prematurely in the simvastatin 40 mg/day plus rifaximin group due to recommendations by the data safety monitoring board. Patients in the simvastatin 40 mg/day plus rifaximin group showed a significant increase in AST and ALT compared with the placebo group (mean differences between the groups at the end of treatment for AST 130 IU/L [95% CI 54 to 205; p=0·0009] and for ALT 61 IU/L [22 to 100; p=0·0025]. We observed no significant differences at 12 weeks in AST and ALT between the simvastatin 20 mg/day plus rifaximin and placebo group (for AST -14 IU/L [-91 to 64; p=0·728] and for ALT -8 IU/L [-49 to 33; p=0·698]). We observed no significant differences in alkaline phosphatase between the the simvastatin 40 mg/day plus rifaximin or the simvastatin 20 mg/day plus rifaximin groups compared with placebo. Patients in the simvastatin 40 mg/day plus rifaximin group showed an increase in creatine kinase at the end of treatment compared with patients in the placebo group (1009 IU/L [208 to 1809]; p=0·014). We observed no significant changes in creatine kinase in the simvastatin 20 mg/day plus rifaximin group (4·2 IU/L [-804 to 813]; p=0·992). Three (19%) patients in the simvastatin 40 mg/day group developed liver and muscle toxicity consistent with rhabdomyolysis. The number of patients who stopped treatment because of adverse events was significantly higher in the simvastatin 40 mg/day plus rifaximin group (nine [56%] of 16 patients) compared with the other two groups (two [14%] of 14 for both groups; p=0·017). There were no serious unexpected adverse reactions reported during the study.Treatment with simvastatin 40 mg/day plus rifaximin in patients with decompensated cirrhosis was associated with a significant increase in adverse events requiring treatment withdrawal, particularly rhabdomyolysis, compared with simvastatin 20 mg/day plus rifaximin. We recommend simvastatin 20 mg/day as the dose to be used in studies investigating the role of statins in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.Horizon 20/20 European programme.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, we have constructed a bioactive  (LC) strain, LC, by inserting  (myosin cross-reactive antigen) gene, which stimulates the conversion of conjugated linoleic acids. In this study, we evaluated the modulation of gut  and protective roles of LC against pathogenic  serovar Typhimurium (ST) and enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) infections in BALB/cJ mice. We observed that LC colonized efficiently in mice gut intestine and competitively reduced the infection with ST and EHEC in various locations of small and large intestine, specifically cecum, jejunum, and ileum ( < 0.05). Positive modulation of the cecal , for example, higher relative abundances of Firmicutes, lower relative abundances of Proteobacteria, and increased bacterial species diversity/richness, was detected in ST-challenged mice pretreated with LC based on 16S metagenomic sequencing. Cytokine gene expression analysis indicated that mice pretreated with LC associated with attenuated bacterial pathogen-induced gut inflammation. Furthermore, mice fed daily with LC for one week could protect themselves from the impairments caused by enteric infections with ST or EHEC. These impairments include weight loss, negative hematological changes, intestinal histological alterations, and potential death. This  study suggests that daily consumption of novel conjugated linoleic acids over-producing probiotic effectively improves intestinal  composition and prevents/combats foodborne enteric bacterial infections with pathogenic  and diarrheagenic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31452345>A commercial seaweed extract structured microbial communities associated with tomato and pepper roots and significantly increased crop yield.</a></h2><p>Seaweeds have been used as a source of natural fertilizer and biostimulant in agriculture for centuries. However, their effects on soil and crop root  remain unclear. Here, we used a commercially available Ascophyllum nodosum extract (ANE) to test its effect on bacterial and fungal communities of rhizospheric soils and roots of pepper and tomato plants in greenhouse trials. Two independent trials were conducted in a split-block design. We used amplicon sequencing targeting fungal ITS and bacterial 16S rRNA gene to determine microbial community structure changes. We find that productivity parameters of root, shoot and fruit biomass were positively and significantly influenced by the ANE amendment. In addition, a-diversity differed significantly between amended and control plants, but only in some of the experimental conditions. Species composition among sites (-diversity) differed according to the amendment treatment in all four communities (fungal-root, fungal-soil, bacterial-root and bacterial-soil). Finally, we identified a number of candidate taxa most strongly correlated with crop yield increases. Further studies on isolation and characterization of these microbial taxa linked to the application of liquid seaweed extract may help to enhance crop yield in sustainable agro-ecosystems.© 2019 The Authors.

It is usually diagnosed clinically by direct detection of an abnormal pattern of the intestinal . The intermediate diagnosis based on determining the content of microflora metabolites, considered as chemical markers of this disorder, is still rarely used. This is, among others, due to the variety of properties of compounds recognised as dysbiosis markers and as a consequence, the use of different methods for their analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no analytical procedure that would allow unambiguous determination of all compounds in one procedure. In the present study, we have established a detailed method for the quantitative analysis of hydrocinnamic, citramalic, p-hydroxybenzeneacetic, tartaric, hippuric, 4-hydroxybenzoic, indoxylsulfuric, tricarballylic, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic and benzoic acids along with DL-arabitol that employs the direct derivatization of compounds in a small volume of urine sample followed by gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). To show that the optimised method is a useful tool for chemical diagnosis of dysbiosis, it was applied for determination of the dysbiosis markers in the authentic urine samples.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The gut  is considered as a factor involved in the regulation of numerous metabolic pathways by impacting several functions of the host. It has been suggested that probiotics can modulate host gene expression and metabolism, and thereby positively influence host adipose tissue development and obesity related-metabolic disorders. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing  strain on host glucose and lipid metabolism and the gut microbial composition in a short-term diet-induced obesity (DIO) in mice. C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into three groups: a control group that received control standard diet, a group fed a high-fat diet (HF), and a group fed HF supplemented with  IPLA R1. Fasting serum insulin as well as triglycerides accumulation in the liver were significantly reduced in the group receiving  IPLA R1. The treatment with the EPS-producing  IPLA R1 tended to down-regulate the expression of host genes involved in the hepatic synthesis of fatty acids which was concomitant with an upregulation in the expression of genes related with fatty acid oxidation.  IPLA R1 not only promoted the increase of  but also the levels of . Our data indicate that the EPS-producing  IPLA R1 strain may have beneficial effects in metabolic disorders associated with obesity, by modulating the gut  composition and promoting changes in lipids metabolism and glucose homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400167>Acidic pH promotes lipopolysaccharide modification and alters colonization in a bacteria-animal mutualism.</a></h2><p>Environmental pH can be an important cue for symbiotic bacteria as they colonize their eukaryotic hosts. Using the model mutualism between the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid, we characterized the bacterial transcriptional response to acidic pH experienced during the shift from planktonic to host-associated lifestyles. We found several genes involved in outer membrane structure were differentially expressed based on pH, indicating alterations in membrane physiology as V. fischeri initiates its symbiotic program. Exposure to host-like pH increased the resistance of V. fischeri to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymixin , which resembles antibacterial molecules that are produced by the squid to select V. fischeri from the ocean . Using a forward genetic screen, we identified a homolog of eptA, a predicted phosphoethanolamine transferase, as critical for antimicrobial defense. We used MALDI-MS to verify eptA as an ethanolamine transferase for the lipid-A portion of V. fischeri lipopolysaccharide. We then used a DNA pulldown approach to discover that eptA transcription is activated by the global regulator H-NS. Finally, we revealed that eptA promotes successful squid colonization by V. fischeri, supporting its potential role in initiation of this highly specific symbiosis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589780>Function2Form Bridge-Toward synthetic protein holistic performance prediction.</a></h2><p>Protein engineering and synthetic biology stand to benefit immensely from recent advances in silico tools for structural and functional analyses of proteins. In the context of designing novel proteins, current in silico tools inform the user on individual parameters of a query protein, with output scores/metrics unique to each parameter. In reality, proteins feature multiple "parts"/functions and modification of a protein aimed at altering a given part, typically has collateral impact on other protein parts. A system for prediction of the combined effect of design parameters on the overall performance of the final protein does not exist. Function2Form Bridge (F2F-Bridge) attempts to address this by combining the scores of different design parameters pertaining to the protein being analyzed into a single easily interpreted output describing overall performance. The strategy comprises of (a) a mathematical strategy combining data from a myriad of in silico tools into an OP-score (a singular score informing on a user-defined overall performance) and () the F2F Plot, a graphical means of informing the wetlab biologist holistically on designed construct suitability in the context of multiple parameters, highlighting scope for improvement. F2F predictive output was compared with wetlab data from a range of synthetic proteins designed, built, and tested for this study. Statistical/machine learning approaches for predicting overall performance, for use alongside the F2F plot, were also examined. Comparisons between wetlab performance and F2F predictions demonstrated close and reliable correlations.

Inflammatory bowel disease is favorably influenced by consumption of several dietary natural plant products such as pomegranate, walnuts, and berries containing polyphenolic compounds such as ellagitannins and ellagic acid. The gut  metabolizes ellagic acid resulting in the formation of bioactive urolithins A, , C, and D. Urolithin A (UA) is the most active and effective gut metabolite and acts as a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant agent. However, whether gut metabolite UA affects the function of immune cells remains incompletely understood. T cell proliferation is stimulated by store operated Ca entry (SOCE) resulting from stimulation of Orai1 by STIM1/STIM2. We show here that treatment of murine CD4 T cells with UA (10 μM, 3 days) significantly blunted SOCE in CD4 T cells, an effect paralleled by significant downregulation of Orai1 and STIM1/2 transcript levels and protein abundance. UA treatment further increased miR-10a-5p abundance in CD4 T cells in a dose dependent fashion. Overexpression of miR-10a-5p significantly decreased STIM1/2 and Orai1 mRNA and protein levels as well as SOCE in CD4 T cells. UA further decreased CD4 T cell proliferation. Thus, the gut bacterial metabolite UA increases miR-10a-5p levels thereby downregulating Orai1/STIM1/STIM2 expression, store operated Ca entry, and proliferation of murine CD4 T cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443102>Colonization by . infantis EVC001 modulates enteric inflammation in exclusively breastfed infants.</a></h2><p>Infant gut dysbiosis, often associated with low abundance of bifidobacteria, is linked to impaired immune development and inflammation-a risk factor for increased incidence of several childhood diseases.

It has been found that both  and its culture supernatant have the potential to mitigate alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, the exact mechanism is still not fully understood. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have immunosuppressive effects with few side effects. The synergistic effect between  culture supernatant and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) deserves further observation. In this study, a mouse model of chronic alcoholic hepatitis was established by eight weeks of Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet feeding; and LGG-s, BMMSCs or a combination of the two were used to explore a new therapeutic method for alcoholic liver disease and to study the mechanism. The results showed that the combined LGG-s and BMMSC treatment might have a synergistic effect and could improve the symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis by regulating inflammation, autophagy and lymphocyte subsets through the PI3k/NF-kB and PI3K/mTOR pathways. With the treatment, the autophagy rate accelerated, and alcohol-induced natural killer  (NKB) cell and follicular helper T (TFH) cell numbers decreased. These findings suggest that the development of alcoholic hepatitis may occur via PI3K/NF-kB and PI3K/mTOR pathway overactivation as well as through NKB and TFH cell imbalances. Moreover, LGG-s and BMMSCs can regulate these factors and alleviate the disease.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563774>Bacillus coagulans R11 maintained intestinal villus health and decreased intestinal injury in lead-exposed mice by regulating the intestinal  and influenced the function of faecal microRNAs.</a></h2><p>Lead contamination is an environmental problem, especially in developing countries; due to the nondegradable characteristics of lead, it is easily deposited in human and animal bodies by the food chain.

Correlation network differences between  and metabolites in cirrhotics from Turkey vs the USA were evaluated.Predicted microbial function showed lower amino acid, bioenergetics and lipid pathways, with functions related to vitamin , glycan, xenobiotic metabolism, DNA/RNA synthesis, in cirrhotics from Turkey compared to the USA. Plasma metabolomics demonstrated higher relative lactate levels in Turkey vs the USA. The metabolite changes in decompensated cirrhosis, compared to controls, showed similar trends in Turkey and the USA, with reduced lipids and phosphocholines.

However, dietary adherence is challenging to maintain while ensuring adequate nutrition, which can lead to sub-optimal clinical outcomes. Metabolomics offers a systematic approach to identify new biomarkers of disease progression in PKU when using urine as a surrogate for blood specimens that is more accurate than self-reported diet records. Herein, the plasma and urine metabolome of a cohort of classic PKU patients (median age = 11 years; n = 22) mainly prescribed (78%) a Phe-restricted diet were characterized using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS). Overall, there was good mutual agreement between plasma Phe and tyrosine (Tyr) concentrations measured from PKU patients when using an amino acid analyzer based on UPLC-UV as compared to MSI-CE-MS with a mean bias of 12% (n = 82). Longitudinal measurements of recently diagnosed PKU infants (n = 3) revealed good long-term regulation of blood Phe with dietary management, and only occasional episodes exceeding the recommended therapeutic range (>360 μM) unlike older PKU patients. Plasma metabolomic studies demonstrated that non-adherent PKU patients had lower circulating concentrations of Tyr, arginine, 2-aminobutyric acid, and propionylcarnitine (q < 0.05, FDR) that were inversely correlated to Phe (r ≈ -0.600 to -0.830). Nontargeted metabolite profiling also revealed urinary biomarkers associated with poor dietary adherence among PKU patients, including elevated concentrations of catabolites indicative of Phe intoxication (e.g., phenylpyruvic acid, phenylacetylglutamine, hydroxyphenylacetic acid). Additionally, PKU patients with poor blood Phe control had lower excretion of urinary compounds derived from co-metabolism of Tyr due to  activity (e.g., cresol sulfate, phenylsulfate), as well as several metabolites associated with inadequate nutrient intake, including low carnitine and  vitamin status (e.g., folic acid, vitamin B12). Interestingly, an unknown urinary metabolite was strongly correlated with Phe excretion in PKU patients (r = 0.861), which was subsequently identified as imidazole lactic acid when using high resolution MS/MS. Overall, urine profiling offers a non-invasive approach for better treatment monitoring of individual PKU patients, which can also guide the design of novel therapies that improve adherence to Phe-restricted diets without acquired nutritional deficiencies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600121>Pathogenesis of HIV-related lung disease: Immunity, infection, and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Despite anti-retroviral therapy (ART), HIV-related pulmonary disease continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality for people living with HIV (PLWH).

Few studies have examined this phenomenon in humans, and none have incorporated metatranscriptomics, important for determining expression of metagenomic functions in the microbial community.In melanoma patients undergoing immunotherapy, gut  was characterized in pre-treatment stool using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenome sequencing (n = 27). Transcriptional expression of metagenomic pathways was confirmed with metatranscriptome sequencing in a subset of 17. We examined associations of taxa and metagenomic pathways with progression-free survival (PFS) using 500 × 10-fold cross-validated elastic-net penalized Cox regression.Higher microbial community richness was associated with longer PFS in 16S and shotgun data (p < 0.05). Clustering based on overall  composition divided patients into three groups with differing PFS; the low-risk group had 99% lower risk of progression than the high-risk group at any time during follow-up (p = 0.002). Among the species selected in regression, abundance of Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides massiliensis, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Blautia producta were related to shorter PFS, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus eutactus, Prevotella stercorea, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3 1 46FAA to longer PFS. Metagenomic functions related to PFS that had correlated metatranscriptomic expression included risk-associated pathways of L-rhamnose degradation, guanosine nucleotide biosynthesis, and  vitamin biosynthesis.This work adds to the growing evidence that gut  are related to immunotherapy outcomes, and identifies, for the first time, transcriptionally expressed metagenomic pathways related to PFS.

(3) Results: Primer pairs varied in their resulting ITS mycobiome profiles, suggesting that particular pairs may be more relevant for analysis of respiratory samples compared to others. Assessment of DNA extraction methods highlighted lower final DNA concentrations achieved by mechanical disruption compared to enzymatic lysis. However, despite lower yields, DNA liberated by mechanical lysis more readily yielded ITS bands with highest success in combination with the Fseq and Rseq primers. (4) Conclusion: Choice of extraction method, primers used, and sequencing approach are all important considerations in sequencing the mycobiome and should be tailored to sample type. A standardization of approach to mycobiome studies using respiratory specimens will permit more reliable comparisons between studies and improve our understanding of the role of fungi in the human airway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31422890>An Ecological Loop: Host Microbiomes across Multitrophic Interactions.</a></h2><p>Our knowledge of host-associated microorganisms and their role in host functions is rapidly evolving. Stress-affected plants assemble beneficial microbes in their rhizosphere to maximize survival and growth. Similarly, insects have gut microbiomes that extend their functional repertoire in fighting stress. A strong microbial linkage between soil, plants, and pollinators is emerging and this can influence pollination services and overall ecosystem health. Yet, the nature of microbial interactions between different ecosystem components remains poorly understood. Here we highlight the acquisition pathways of beneficial microbes and their functions in protecting hosts against stress. By adopting a new 'eco-holobiont' approach, which explicitly incorporates biotic feedbacks, we can significantly expand our ecological understanding and better develop sustainable environmental management.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Rapid induction of bactericidal activity in the insect gut at the onset of pupation has been described in numerous orders of the Holometabola and is best-studied in the Lepidoptera where it is under control of the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) moulting pathway. Here, using RNAseq, we compare the expression of immune effector genes in the gut during metamorphosis in a holometabolous (Galleria mellonella) and a hemimetabolous insect (Gryllus bimaculatus). We find that in G. mellonella, the expression of numerous immune effectors and the transcription factor GmEts are upregulated, with peak expression of three antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and a lysozyme coinciding with delamination of the larval gut. By contrast, no such upregulation was detectable in the hemimetabolous Gr. bimaculatus. These findings support the idea that the upregulation of immune effectors at the onset of complete metamorphosis is an adaptive response, which controls the  during gut replacement.

However, its influences on bird gut morphology and intestinal  were still unclear. We used female Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to examine the effects of chronic lead exposure (0, 50 ppm and 1000 ppm) on cecal histology, microbial communities and immune function. The results showed 50 ppm lead exposure caused subtle damages of cecum cell structure. However, 1000 ppm lead exposure caused severe cecum histopathological changes characterized by mucosa abscission, Lieberkühn glands destruction and lymphocyte proliferation. Moreover, both lead concentrations induced ultrastructural damages featured by nucleus pyknosis, mitochondrial vacuolation and microvilli contraction. Meanwhile, microbial community structure, species diversity, taxonomic compositions and taxa abundance in the cecum were affected by lead exposure. Furthermore, the mRNA relative expression of immunity-related genes such as interleukin 2 (IL-2) and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) was significantly downregulated while that of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and natural killer kappa  (NF-κ) was significantly upregulated in the cecum of 50 and 1000 ppm lead exposure groups. We concluded that lead exposure may cause gut health impairment of female Japanese quails by inducing cecal histopathological changes,  dysbiosis and cecal immune disorder.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Some probiotics were demonstrated to exert beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract. The present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effects of Lactobacillus plantarum CMU995 against alcohol-induced liver injury. The mice were orally administered L. plantarum CMU995 for 1 week, followed by the administration of alcohol and different tested substances daily for 6 weeks. The liver injury was examined by measuring the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA), anti-oxidative enzyme, endotoxin, inflammatory cytokines, and lipid accumulation in the liver or serum among different groups. L. plantarum CMU995 exhibited beneficial effects on alcohol-induced liver injury via reduction in the serum concentration of AST, ALT, cholesterol, triglycerides, endotoxin, TNF-α, IL-1β, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we also found that the levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and intestinal tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were considerably higher in L. plantarum CMU995-fed groups when compared with placebo group. Meanwhile, the protective effects were demonstrated biological gradients as controversial dose-dependent. We speculate that L. plantarum CMU995 inhibited the migration of alcohol-derived endotoxin into the blood and liver, thereby improving the intestinal barrier. The present evidence may provide a novel -based strategy to prevent the alcohol-induced liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621728>Effects of theabrownin on serum metabolites and gut  in rats with a high-sugar diet.</a></h2><p>Evidence has proven that the gut  is an important environmental factor contributing to obesity by altering host energy harvest and storage. We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, 1H-indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indole acrylic acid and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic acid, l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and insulin resistance was observed.

Thereafter, dual-species  and  combination probiotics were routinely administered daily to high-risk neonates; from April 2016 triple-species probiotics (    and   subspecies ) were used.Incidence of NEC (modified Bell's stage 2a or greater), late-onset sepsis, and mortality.Rates of NEC fell from 7.5% (35/469 neonates) in the pre-implementation epoch to 3.1% (16/513 neonates) in the routine probiotics epoch (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85, p=0.014). The more than halving of NEC rates after probiotics introduction was independent of any measured covariates, including breast milk feeding rates. Cases of late-onset sepsis fell from 106/469 (22.6%) to 59/513 (11.5%) (p<0.0001), and there was no episode of sepsis due to  or . All-cause mortality also fell in the routine probiotics epoch, from 67/469 (14.3%) to 47/513 (9.2%), although this was not statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.74, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.12, p=0.155).Administration of multispecies  and  probiotics has been associated with a significantly decreased risk of NEC and late-onset sepsis in our neonatal unit, and no safety issues.

In Europe, Lso causes severe losses to carrot and represents a threat to the potato industry. A rising concern is Lso transmission from carrot to potato and within potato, and this has driven the need for monitoring populations of psyllid species which could serve as vectors on both crops. This would provide a fundamental understanding of the epidemiology of Lso. Different sampling methods were used to survey populations of psyllid species in commercial carrot and potato fields in central and eastern mainland Spain from 2015 to 2017. Two psyllid species,   and   were found on carrot and potato crops. In carrot fields the most abundant species was   (occurring from crop emergence to harvest); whereas in potato crops the most abundant psyllid species was  . Depending on field location, the maximum psyllid populations occurred between June and October.

Their global spread in arthropods and varied impacts on animal physiology, evolution, and vector control are in part due to parasitic drive systems that enhance the fitness of infected females, the transmitting sex of Wolbachia. Male killing is one common drive mechanism wherein the sons of infected females are selectively killed. Despite decades of research, the gene(s) underlying Wolbachia-induced male killing remain unknown. Here using comparative genomic, transgenic, and cytological approaches in fruit flies, we identify a candidate gene in the eukaryotic association module of Wolbachia prophage WO, termed WO-mediated killing (wmk), which transgenically causes male-specific lethality during early embryogenesis and cytological defects typical of the pathology of male killing.

Feces from CAFOs is often used as fertilizer on fields. However, little is known about the effects manure has on the soil , which is an important aspect of soil health and fertility. In addition, due to the subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics necessary to keep the animals healthy, CAFO manure has elevated levels of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Using 16s rRNA high-throughput sequencing and qPCR, this study sought to determine the impact of swine CAFO manure application on both the soil  and abundance of select antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile element genes (erm(), erm(C), sul1, str(), intI1, IncW repA) in agricultural soil over the fall and spring seasons. We found the manure community to be distinct from the soil community, with a majority of bacteria belonging to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The soil samples had more diverse communities dominated by Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and unclassified bacteria. We observed significant differences in the soil  between all time points, except between the spring samples. However, by tracking manure associated taxa, we found the addition of the manure  to be a minor driver of the shift. Of the measured genes, manure application only significantly increased the abundance of erm() and erm(C) which remained elevated in the spring. These results suggest bacteria in the manure do not survive well in soil and that ARG dynamics in soil following manure application vary by resistance gene.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614751>Metagenomic Insights into the Effects of Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) on the Composition of Luminal and Mucosal  in C57BL/6J Mice, Especially the  Composition.</a></h2><p>Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are considered prebiotics and have been proven to selectively promote the growth of  in the gut.

After FOS intervention, there were significant increases in the total and wall weights of the cecum and the amount of total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the cecal contents of the mice. At the phylum level, the results showed a significant increase in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in the contents and mucosa from the cecum to the distal colon in the FOS group. Besides , a significant increase was observed in the relative abundance of  in all samples at the genus level, which may be partially related to the increase in butyric acid levels in the luminal contents. Furthermore,  sequencing revealed that  was almost the sole bifidobacterial species in the luminal contents (>98%) and mucosa (>89%).

Recent evidence on non-traditional determinants of cardiometabolic health has advanced our understanding of lifestyle-disease interactions. Chronic exposure to environmental stressors like poor diet quality, sedentarism, ambient air pollution and noise, sleep deprivation and psychosocial stress affect numerous traditional and non-traditional intermediary pathways related to ASCVD. These include body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength and functionality and the intestinal , which are increasingly recognized as major determinants of cardiovascular health. Evidence points to partially overlapping mechanisms, including effects on inflammatory and nutrient sensing pathways, endocrine signalling, autonomic function and autophagy. Of particular relevance is the potential of low-risk lifestyle factors to impact on plaque vulnerability through altered adipose tissue and skeletal muscle phenotype and secretome. Collectively, low-risk lifestyle factors cause a set of phenotypic adaptations shifting tissue cross-talk from a proinflammatory milieu conducive for high-risk atherosclerosis to an anti-atherogenic milieu. The ketone body ß-hydroxybutyrate, through inhibition of the NLRP-3 inflammasome, is likely to be an intermediary for many of these observed benefits. Adhering to low-risk lifestyle factors adds to the prognostic value of optimal risk factor management, and benefit occurs even when the impact on conventional risk markers is discouragingly minimal or not present. The aims of this review are (a) to discuss novel lifestyle risk factors and their underlying biochemical principles and () to provide new perspectives on potentially more feasible recommendations to improve long-term adherence to low-risk lifestyle factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590459>Broccoli or Sulforaphane: Is It the Source or Dose That Matters?</a></h2><p>There is robust epidemiological evidence for the beneficial effects of broccoli consumption on health, many of them clearly mediated by the isothiocyanate sulforaphane.

Besides its effect in blood pressure reduction, ZGXFD is also known to be a radical therapy with little or no side effects. Compared with western medicines, Chinese medicinal formulas have the advantage of simultaneously attacking multiple targets.

Meanwhile, ZGXFD can maintain the integrity of intestinal mechanistic barrier and elevate the percentage of bacteria producing short chain fatty acids (SCFA). By investigating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system, we found that ZGXFD can decrease the expression of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) in lungs, which in turn causes a increase in AngI produces angiotensin1-7 (Ang1-7) and decrease in AngII.

The bacterial composition of each sample was determined using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA. Intra- and intergroup biodiversity was analyzed. Clinical periodontal parameters and daily oral hygiene habits were recorded.Reduction of plaque, increased daily brushing frequency and decreased dessert intake were observed in Group P compared to in Group . 1,853,952 valid reads were obtained from the 50 salivary samples, with 37,904 sequences per sample. No significant differences were detected in the intra- and intergroup biodiversity comparisons between the two groups. By clustering, 8885 OTUs were identified and categorized into six major phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria and Candidate_division_TM7_norank. At the genus level, compared with Group , Group P demonstrated significantly increased Bacillus abundance and decreased Prevotella abundance.Our results suggested that the general biodiversity and salivary microbial community structure did not change significantly and that patients had increased beneficial oral hygiene habits and awareness during the first six months of Invisalign treatment. Hence, on the basis of this study, it appears that Invisalign aligner treatment did not induce deterioration of oral health nor significant biodiversity changes in oral bacterial communities, assuming that detailed oral hygiene instructions for both teeth and aligners were provided.

Using two indicators of bacterial fitness, growth rate and abundance, we determined the effect of  on  fitness. In liquid culture, we found that  amoebas lowered the growth rate of both  species. In soil microcosms, we tracked the abundance of  grown with and without  over a month and found that  had larger populations when associating with  while  was not significantly affected. Overall, we find that both  and  pay a cost to associate with , but  can also benefit under some conditions. Understanding how fitness varies in facultative symbionts will help us understand the persistence of host-symbiont relationships.This article has earned an Open Data Badge for making publicly available the digitally-shareable data necessary to reproduce the reported results.

Different experimental systems have led to conflicting conclusions regarding inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions of PI3Kγ. Here, we report a human patient with bi-allelic, loss-of-function mutations in PIK3CG resulting in absence of the p110γ catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ. She has a history of childhood-onset antibody defects, cytopenias, and T lymphocytic pneumonitis and colitis, with reduced peripheral blood memory , memory CD8+ T, and regulatory T cells and increased CXCR3+ tissue-homing CD4 T cells. PI3Kγ-deficient macrophages and monocytes produce elevated inflammatory IL-12 and IL-23 in a GSK3α/β-dependent manner upon TLR stimulation. Pik3cg-deficient mice recapitulate major features of human disease after exposure to natural  through co-housing with pet-store mice. Together, our results emphasize the physiological importance of PI3Kγ in restraining inflammation and promoting appropriate adaptive immune responses in both humans and mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430598>On the origin of eating disorders: altered signaling between gut , adaptive immunity and the brain melanocortin system regulating feeding behavior.</a></h2><p>Research in the field of gut  - brain axis may contribute to clarifying the origin of anorexia nervosa and bulimia, the two principal forms of eating disorders (ED). The initial key findings in ED patients of plasma immunoglobulins (Ig) that react with α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a neuropeptide in the brain signaling satiety, have initiated further studies leading to the discovery of the origin of such autoantibodies and to the understanding their possible functional role. An anorexigenic bacterial protein Escherichia coli caseinolytic protease  was recently found to be responsible for the production of α-MSH-cross-reactive autoantibodies and this protein was also detected in human plasma. Another recent study revealed enhanced activation of appetite-regulating the melanocortin type 4 receptor by immune complexes withα-MSH. Taken together, these data serve to build a pathophysiological model of ED presented in this article.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Here, we investigated the ecological drivers of the bacterial gut  in cockroaches that feed on lignocellulosic leaf litter.The physicochemical conditions determined with microsensors in the guts of Ergaula capucina, Pycnoscelus surinamensis, and Byrsotria rothi were similar to those reported for both wood-feeding and omnivorous cockroaches. All gut compartments were anoxic at the center and showed a slightly acidic to neutral pH and variable but slightly reducing conditions. Hydrogen accumulated only in the crop of . rothi. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes documented that community structure in individual gut compartments correlated strongly with the respective microenvironmental conditions. A comparison of the hindgut  of cockroaches and termites from different feeding groups revealed that the vast majority of the core taxa in cockroaches with a lignocellulosic diet were present also in omnivorous cockroaches but absent in wood-feeding higher termites.Our results indicate that diet is not the primary driver of bacterial community structure in the gut of wood- and litter-feeding cockroaches.

The aim of this study was to highlight the role of the  and the ClpB protein in deregulation and self-maintenance of anorexia pathology. Male C57Bl/6 mice were undergone to the ABA (Activity-Based Anorexia) protocol: after 5 days of acclimatization, both ABA and LFA (Limited Food Access) mice had progressively limited access to food until D17. At the end of protocol, the plasma ClpB concentration and  DNA in colonic content were measured. As expected, dietary restriction induced lost weight in LFA and ABA mice. At D10, colonic permeability and plasma concentration of the ClpB protein were significantly increased in LFA and ABA mice vs. controls. At D17, plasma concentration of ClpB was increased in LFA and ABA mice and, it was correlated with proportion of  in the faeces.

Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate immunity pathways such as nuclear factor ĸ (NF-ĸ) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut  can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut  and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut  through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸ inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric acid production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484413>Urolithin Metabotypes can Anticipate the Different Restoration of the Gut  and Anthropometric Profiles during the First Year Postpartum.</a></h2><p>The metabolism of dietary polyphenols ellagitannins by the gut- allows the human stratification in urolithin metabotypes depending on the final urolithins produced. Metabotype-A only produces urolithin-A, metabotype- yields urolithin- and isourolithin-A in addition to urolithin-A, and metabotype 0 does not produce urolithins. Metabotype-A has been suggested to be 'protective', and metabotype- dysbiotic-prone to cardiometabolic impairments. We analyzed the gut- of 40 healthy women and determined their metabotypes and enterotypes, and their associations with anthropometric and gut-microbial changes after 3 weeks, 4, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Metabotype-A was predominant in mothers who lost weight (≥2 kg) (75%) versus metabotype- (54%). After delivery, the  of metabotype-A mothers changed, unlike metabotype-, which barely changed over 1 year. The metabotype-A discriminating bacteria correlated to the decrease of the women's waist while some metabotype- bacteria were inversely associated with a reduction of body mass index (BMI), waist, and waist-to-hip ratio. Metabotype- was associated with a more robust and less modulating microbial and anthropometric profiles versus metabotype-A, in which these profiles were normalized through the 1-year follow-up postpartum. Consequently, urolithin metabotypes assessment could be a tool to anticipate the predisposition of women to normalize their anthropometric values and gut-, significantly altered during pregnancy and after childbirth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562814>Association between the respiratory  and susceptibility to influenza virus infection.</a></h2><p>Previous studies suggest that the nose/throat  may play an important role in shaping host immunity and modifying the risk of respiratory infection. Our aim is to quantify the association between the nose/throat  and susceptibility to influenza virus infection.In this household transmission study, index cases with confirmed influenza virus infection and their household contacts were followed for 9-12 days to identify secondary influenza infections. Respiratory swabs were collected at enrollment to identify and quantify bacterial species via high- performance sequencing. Data were analyzed by an individual hazard-based transmission model that was adjusted for age, vaccination, and household size.We recruited 115 index cases with influenza A(H3N2) or  infection, and 436 household contacts. We estimated that a 10-fold increase in the abundance in Streptococcus spp. and Prevotella salivae was associated with 48% (95% CI: 9%, 69%) and 25% (95% CI: 0.5%, 42%) lower susceptibility to influenza A(H3N2) infection, respectively. By contrast, for influenza  infection, a 10-fold increase in the abundance in Streptococcus vestibularis and Prevotella spp. was associated with 63% (95% CI: 17%, 83%) lower and 83% (95% CI: 15%, 210%) higher susceptibility, respectively.Susceptibility to influenza infection is associated with the nose/throat  at the time of exposure. The effects of oligotypes on susceptibility differ between influenza A(H3N2) and  viruses. Our results suggest that  may be a useful predictor of susceptibility, with the implication that  could be modulated to reduce influenza infection risk, should these associations be causal.© The Author(s) 2019.

A complex bacterial community from the simulated transverse colon  was studied using quantitative PCR to estimate different bacterial group concentrations and a HPLC was used to estimate short-chain fatty acids concentrations. We found that lyso-Gb3 increased the biofilm-forming capacity of several individual bacteria, including Bacteroides fragilis and significantly increased the growth of . fragilis in a multispecies biofilm. Lyso-Gb3 also modified the bacterial composition of the human colon  suspension, increasing bacterial counts of . fragilis, among others. Finally, lyso-Gb3 modified the formation of short-chain fatty acids, leading to a striking decrease in butyrate concentration.

Evidence suggests that the peripheral immune system communicates with central nervous system and the effect propagates through microglial and lymphocyte crosstalk, especially during neuro-inflammation. Although, there is previous literature indicating changes in lymphocyte population in schizophrenia, detailed studies with respect to T and  cells are scarce. Mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are functionally associated with the gut . The gut  has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, there is no information on the frequency of MAIT cells in schizophrenia. Hence, we investigated changes in proportions of T cells,  cells and MAIT cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from antipsychotic-free patients with schizophrenia in comparison to healthy controls. In line with earlier reports, we noted perturbations in T17 cells. This study for the first time reports changes in frequencies of MAIT cells in a homogenous population of antipsychotic-free patients with schizophrenia. These changes, though not common across all patients nevertheless point to the fact that inflammation is prevalent in a significant subset of schizophrenia cases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Here, we have evaluated riboflavin (B2 vitamin) production by five  strains isolated from , a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from north-western Argentina and their isogenic riboflavin-overproducing derivatives previously selected using roseoflavin. A direct fluorescence spectroscopic detection method to quantify riboflavin production in bacterial culture supernatants has been tested. Comparison of the efficiency for riboflavin fluorescence quantification with and without prior HPLC fractionation showed that the developed method is a rapid and easy test for selection of B2 vitamin-producing strains. In addition, it can be used for quantitative detection of the vitamin production in real time during bacterial growth. On the basis of this and previous analyses, the  M5MA1-B2 riboflavin overproducer was selected for  and  studies after being fluorescently labeled by transfer of the pRCR12 plasmid, which encodes the mCherry protein. The labeling did not affect negatively the growth, the riboflavin production nor the adhesion of the strain to Caco-2 cells.

In Experiment 1, twenty goats were fed with an isonitrogenous diet, containing 28% Non-Fiber Carbohydrate (MNFC group,  = 10) or 14% NFC (LNFC group,  = 10). In the MNFC group, the ruminal concentration of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) increased, and pH declined. Compared with those in the LNFC group, the microbial protein synthesis in rumen and mRNA abundance of urea transporter  (UT-) in rumen epithelium increased in the MNFC group, although serum urea-N (SUN) did not differ significantly between groups. Simultaneously, urinal urea-N excretion was reduced in the MNFC group. Significant correlations were found between rumen SCFA and UT- and between UT- and urinal urea-N excretion. Furthermore, the abundances of SCFA receptor of GPR41 and GPR43 increased in the rumen epithelium of the MNFC group. These results suggest that increases of SUN transported into the rumen and incorporated into microbial protein and decreases of urinal urea-N excretion are related to ruminal SCFA. This is supported by data from our previous study in which added SCFA on the mucosal side caused increases of urea transport rate (flux J urea) from the blood to the ruminal lumen side. In Experiment 2, we used 16S rRNA Amplicon Sequencing to analyze the structure of the ruminal  community in relation to SCFA. An additional eight goats were assigned into the MNFC ( = 4) and LNFC ( = 4) groups. The dietary ingredients, chemical composition, and feeding regimes were the same as those in Experiment 1. Constrained correspondence analysis (CCA analysis) revealed NFC promoted the expansion of  diversity, particularly of SCFA-producing microbes. The function prediction of 19 upregulated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ortholog groups showed an NFC-induced increase of the types and abundances of genes coding for enzymes catalyzing N and fatty acid metabolism. Based on our present and previous investigations, our results indicate that, in goats consuming a MNFC diet, the facilitated urea transport in the rumen and improved urea N salvage are triggered by an expansion of ruminal  diversity and are signaled by ruminal SCFA. This study thus provides new insights into the  involved in the dietary modulation of urea-N salvage in ruminant animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487251>[Refractory colitis by Clostridium difficile treated with fecal  transplant].</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile infection is an increasingly recognized cause of diarrhea in inpatients, frequently associated to high mortality.

Severe  infection (sCDI) is a serious and rare nosocomial diarrheal complication, especially in MSAP patients. Fecal  transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractory and recurrent CDI (rCDI). However, knowledge regarding the initial use of FMT in patients suffering from sCDI is limited.Here, we report an MSAP patient complicated with sCDI who was treated by FMT as a first-line therapy. The patient was a 51-year-old man who suffered from diarrhea in his course of acute pancreatitis. An enzyme immunoassay was performed to detect toxins, and the result was positive for toxin-producing  and toxin  and negative for  ribotype 027. The colonoscopy revealed pseudomembranous colitis. Due to these findings, sCDI was our primary consideration. Because the patient provided informed consent for FMT treatment, we initially treated the patient by FMT rather than metronidazole.

Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and -cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory -cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although -cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the  in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health.

The main treatment for mastitis is the administration of antibiotics - usually directly to the udder. There is an urgent need for novel therapies to treat and prevent the disease, given the widespread emergence of antibiotic resistance and concomitant problems in the treatment of human and animal infections. We provide an overview of treatments for bovine mastitis, with emphasis on probiotics, bacteriocins, bacteriophages (phages), and phage endolysins. Probiotics have in recent years proved to be particularly efficacious in bovine mastitis treatment and prevention. In this case, the mode of action is most likely to be due to stimulation of the host immune response which clears the mastitis pathogen. Bacteriocins have the potential to be incorporated into teat washes and wipes, thus preventing pathogen spread on the farm. Phage therapy is limited by the inability of some phages to replicate in raw milk, as reported for some staphylococcal phages, and by their narrow host specificity. The use of phage endolysins is more promising, by enabling the development of broad host range potent antimicrobials, but additional research is required in terms of efficacy, safety and production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608279>Time-Course Transcriptome Analysis for Drug Repositioning in -Infected Human Gingival Fibroblasts.</a></h2><p> () is a crucial periodontal pathogen and human gingival fibroblasts (GFs) are the first line of defense against oral pathogens.

We computationally identified several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs that could protect the  infected GFs via a coexpression-based drug repositioning approach. Biologically, we confirmed that six drugs (etravirine, zalcitabine, wortmannin, calcium D-pantothenate, ellipticine, and tanespimycin) could significantly decrease -induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and block the Protein Kinase  (PKB/AKT)/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Our study provides more detailed molecular mechanisms of the process by which  infects GFs and illustrates the value of the cogena-based drug repositioning method and the potential therapeutic application of these tested drugs in the treatment of  infection.Copyright © 2019 Kang, Jia, Tang, Zhao, Shi, Jia, He and Feng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485278>Serum Zonulin in HBV-Associated Chronic Hepatitis, Liver Cirrhosis, and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The gut  is involved in the occurrence and development of chronic liver diseases. Zonulin is considered a marker of intestinal permeability. The purpose of this study was to assess zonulin levels in patients with chronic hepatitis  (CHB), HBV-associated liver cirrhosis (LC), and HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The study population consisted of 90 HBV-associated HCC patients, 90 HBV-associated LC patients, 90 CHB patients, and 90 healthy subjects. Serum levels of zonulin and AFP were determined. The diagnostic accuracy of each marker was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (AUC).Serum zonulin levels were significantly higher in patients with HCC than in patients with LC or CHB or healthy subjects ( < 0.001). Moreover, the zonulin levels were increased in the advanced stage of LC and HCC. ROC curve analysis revealed that serum zonulin could be used to differentiate CHB from cirrhosis. In addition, the combination of zonulin and AFP exhibited a significantly larger AUC compared with zonulin or AFP alone.Serum zonulin levels were significantly increased both in LC and in HCC and correlated with the advanced stage of LC and HCC. Moreover, the combination of zonulin and AFP confers significant benefit to diagnostic accuracy in differentiating LC from HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539381>Pontoscolex corethrurus: A homeless invasive tropical earthworm?</a></h2><p>The presence of earthworm species in crop fields is as old as agriculture itself. The earthworms Pontoscolex corethrurus (invasive) and Balanteodrilus pearsei (native) are associated with the emergence of agriculture and sedentism in the region Amazon and Maya, respectively. Both species have shifted their preference from their natural habitat to the cropland niche. They contrast in terms of intensification of agricultural land use (anthropic impact to the symbiotic soil ). P. corethrurus inhabits conventional agroecosystems, while . pearsei thrives in traditional agroecosystems, i.e., P. corethrurus has not yet been recorded in soils where . pearsei dwells. The demographic behavior of these two earthworm species was assessed in the laboratory over 100 days, according to their origin (OE; P. corethrurus and . pearsei) food quality (FQ; soil only, maize stubble, Mucuna pruriens), and soil moisture (SM; 25, 33, 42%). The results showed that OE, FQ, SM, and the OE x FQ interaction were highly significant for the survival, growth, and reproduction of earthworms. P. corethrurus showed a lower survival rate (> mortality). P. corethrurus survivors fed a diet of low-to-intermediate nutritional quality (soil and stubble maize, respectively) showed a greater capacity to grow and reproduce; however, it was surpassed by the native earthworm when fed a high-quality diet (M. pruriens). Besides, P. corethrurus displayed a low cocoon hatching (emergence of juveniles). These results suggest that the presence of the invasive species was associated with a negative interaction with the soil  where the native species dwells, and with the absence of natural mutualistic bacteria (gut, nephridia, and cocoons). These results are consistent with the absence of P. corethrurus in milpa and pasture-type agricultural niches managed by peasants (agroecologists) to grow food regularly through biological soil management. Results reported here suggest that P. corethrurus is an invasive species that is neither wild nor domesticated, that is, its eco-evolutionary phylogeny needs to be derived based on its symbionts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531910>Prediction of nutrient digestibility in grower-finisher pigs based on faecal  composition.</a></h2><p> play an important role in total tract nutrient digestion, especially when fibrous diets are fed to pigs. This study aimed to use metagenomics to predict faecal nutrient digestibility in grower-finisher pigs. The study design consisted of 160 three-way crossbreed grower-finisher pigs (80 female and 80 male) which were either fed a diet based on corn/soybean meal or a more fibrous diet based on wheat/barley/by-products. On the day before slaughter, faecal samples were collected and used to determine faecal digestibility of dry matter, ash, organic matter, crude protein, crude fat, crude fibre and non-starch polysaccharides. The faecal samples were also sequenced for the 16S hypervariable region of bacteria (V3/V4) to profile the faecal . With these data, we calculated the between-animal variation in faecal nutrient digestibility associated with variation in the faecal , that is the "microbiability". The microbiability values were significantly greater than zero for dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, crude fibre and non-starch polysaccharides, ranging from 0.58 to 0.93, as well as for crude fat with a value of 0.37, but not significantly different from zero for ash. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, we estimated the accuracy of predicting digestibility values of individual pigs based on their faecal  composition. The accuracies of prediction for crude fat and ash digestibility were virtually 0, and for the other nutrients, the accuracies ranged from 0.42 to 0.63. In conclusion, the faecal  composition gave high microbiability values for faecal digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, crude fibre and non-starch polysaccharides. The accuracies of prediction are relatively low if the interest is in precisely predicting faecal nutrient digestibility of individual pigs, but are promising from the perspective of ranking animals in a genetic selection context.© 2019 The Authors.

Bacteriophages (or phages) represent an alternative treatment that can be used to treat specific bacterial infections. In the present study, we screened water samples from both environmental and industrial sources for phages capable of infecting  laboratory strains within our collection. Nineteen phages were isolatedand tested for their ability to infect strains within the ECOR collection and  O157:H7 Δstx. Furthermore, since coliphages have been reported to cross-infect certain  spp., we also evaluated the ability of the nineteen phages to infect a representative  strain from our collection. Based on having distinct (although overlapping in some cases) host ranges, ten phage isolates were selected for genome sequence and morphological characterization.

Many aquifers contain naturally high levels of iron and some are shallow with surface water intrusion in the wet season. Therefore, environmental bacteria such as iron-cycling bacteria promoting biofilm formation in pipes or opportunistic pathogens can occur in these waters. An opportunistic pathogen endemic to northern Australia and Southeast Asia and emerging worldwide is Burkholderia pseudomallei. It causes the frequently fatal disease melioidosis in humans and animals. As we know very little about the microbial composition of drinking water in remote communities, this study aimed to provide a first snapshot of the  and occurrence of opportunistic pathogens in bulk water and biofilms from the source and through the distribution system of three remote water supplies with varying iron levels. Using 16s-rRNA gene sequencing, we found that the geochemistry of the groundwater had a substantial impact on the untreated . Different iron-cycling bacteria reflected differences in redox status and nutrients. We cultured and sequenced . pseudomallei from bores with elevated iron and from a multi-species biofilm which also contained iron-oxidizing Gallionella, nitrifying Nitrospira and amoebae. Gallionella are increasingly used in iron-removal filters in water supplies and more research is needed to examine these interactions. Similar to other opportunistic pathogens, . pseudomallei occurred in water with low organic carbon levels and with low heterotrophic microbial growth. No . pseudomallei were detected in treated water; however, abundant DNA of another opportunistic pathogen group, non-tuberculous mycobacteria was recovered from treated parts of one supply. Results from this study will inform future studies to ultimately improve management guidelines for water supplies in the wet-dry tropics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424516>Effects of dietary inulin supplementation on the composition and dynamics of cecal  and growth-related parameters in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Inulin, a prebiotic, is an attractive alternative to antibiotic growth promoters in chickens. Dietary supplementation with inulin can improve growth performance, carcass yield, immune system activity, and serum biochemical parameters in chickens. A few studies investigated the impact of dietary inulin supplementation on chicken intestinal . In this study, we investigated how and why dietary supplementation with 1, 2, and 4% inulin can affect body weight gain, feed intake, food conversion rate, immunological parameters, serum biochemical parameters, and composition and dynamics of the cecal  of Tegel broiler chickens using quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (qFISH). We showed that inulin inclusion has a negative effect on growth performance parameters before day 21 and a positive effect subsequently up to day 42. Quantitative FISH data revealed an age-dependent change in the cecal  in the control broilers fed no inulin. Thus, relative abundances of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria decreased from 52.8 to 48.3% of total cells and from 8.7 to 1.4% at days 7 and 42, respectively. However, relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria gradually increased from 9.3 to 26.9% of the total cells and from 10.7 to 21.1%, respectively, over the same periods. Inulin inclusion appeared to lower the relative abundances of Lactobacillus johnsonii and Bifidobacterium species at an early bird age, but it subsequently significantly (P < 0.05) increased their relative abundances. Such increases positively correlated with body weight gain of the birds, determined after day 21. Thus, dietary supplementation with inulin together with the addition of L. johnsonii and Bifidobacterium (. gallinarum and . pullorum) cultures at an early age may help overcome its early negative influence on growth performance. We believe that these findings can improve our knowledge on how inulin can change the intestinal  of broiler chickens and help in developing an inulin feeding regime to optimize its beneficial role in chicken development.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649420>No evidence for airborne transmission of  in a very high prevalence area in Lancaster County.</a></h2><p> () has been associated with acute food-borne illness, chronic low-grade inflammation, neuropsychiatric conditions and reactivation of chronic latent infection in immunocompetent hosts.

Liberia has the largest reported per capita incidence of Lassa fever cases in the region, but genomic information on the circulating strains is scarce. The aim of this study was to substantially increase the available pool of data to help foster the generation of targeted diagnostics and therapeutics.Clinical serum samples collected from 17 positive Lassa fever cases originating from Liberia (16 cases) and Guinea (one case) within the past decade were processed at the Liberian Institute for Biomedical Research using a targeted-enrichment sequencing approach, producing 17 near-complete genomes. An additional 17 Lassa virus sequences (two from Guinea, seven from Liberia, four from Nigeria, and four from Sierra Leone) were generated from viral stocks at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) from samples originating from the Mano River Union (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) region and Nigeria. Sequences were compared with existing Lassa virus genomes and published Lassa virus assays.The 23 new Liberian Lassa virus genomes grouped within two clades (IV.A and IV.) and were genetically divergent from those circulating elsewhere in west Africa. A time-calibrated phylogeographic analysis incorporating the new genomes suggests Liberia was the entry point of Lassa virus into the Mano River Union region and estimates the introduction to have occurred between 300-350 years ago. A high level of diversity exists between the Liberian Lassa virus genomes. Nucleotide percent difference between Liberian Lassa virus genomes ranged up to 27% in the L segment and 18% in the S segment. The commonly used Lassa Josiah-MGB assay was up to 25% divergent across the target sites when aligned to the Liberian Lassa virus genomes.The large amount of novel genomic diversity of Lassa virus observed in the Liberian cases emphasises the need to match deployed diagnostic capabilities with locally circulating strains and underscores the importance of evaluating cross-lineage protection in the development of vaccines and therapeutics.Defense Biological Product Assurance Office of the US Department of Defense and the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch and its Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response Section.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

They harbor various bacteria, viruses, and fungal communities that are either beneficial or potentially pathogenic. Extensive metagenomic studies in bats are limited, particularly for the gut, and to date, there are no reports on the bacterial diversity of Rhinolophus monoceros from Meghalaya, India. There are limited studies on the isolation of potential harmful or beneficial bacteria and their interactions with the environment through culture-dependent approaches. Therefore, high-throughput screening was used to understand the population structure, genetic diversity, and ecological role of the microorganisms. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA marker for gene mapping showed that the gut samples constitute a diverse group of bacteria that is dominated by Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes. The bacterial genera Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium were also observed in the Illumina dataset. Illumina sequencing revealed eight bacterial phyla composed of 112 genera. The metagenomic analysis of the OTUs from the gut revealed diverse bacterial communities as well as zoonotic and human pathogens. There were differences in the bacterial communities between the two methods used in this study, which could be related to host specificity, diet, and habitat. The culture-dependent technique resulted in the isolation of 35 bacterial isolates, of which Bacillus cereus and . anthracis are well-known bacterial pathogens that show virulent traits including hemolytic and proteolytic activities. Pseudomonas stutzeri is an opportunistic human pathogen that was also isolated and showed similar traits. Antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed on all 35 isolates, and different antibiotics were used for Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The result showed that some isolates are resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin G and Cefoxitin. This report on gut bacterial communities could attract interest in the possibility of isolating and characterizing bacteria for the production of antibiotics, enzymes, plant growth promoters, and probiotics. However, the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria that may impose health hazards cannot be ignored and needs to be studied further.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Importantly, ClpB was necessary for  to have an anorexigenic effect in mice, suggesting that it may participate in satiety signaling. To explore this further, we determined the short-term (2 h) effects of three macronutrients: protein (bovine serum albumin), carbohydrate (D-fructose) and fat (oleic acid), on the production of ClpB by  and analyzed whether ClpB can stimulate the secretion of the intestinal satiety hormone, peptide YY (PYY). Isocaloric amounts of all three macronutrients added to a continuous culture of  increased ClpB immunoreactivity. However, to increase the levels of ClpB mRNA and ClpB protein in bacteria and supernatants, supplementation with protein was required. A nanomolar concentration of recombinant  ClpB dose-dependently stimulated PYY secretion from the primary cell cultures of rat intestinal mucosa. Total proteins extracted from  but not from ClpB-deficient  strains also tended to increase PYY secretion. These data support a possible link between  ClpB and protein-induced satiety signaling in the gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31418624>Immunosuppression in the Management of Presumed Non-infective Uveitis; Are We Sure What We are Treating?

However, their antimicrobial properties are usually forgotten, and in the context of increasing knowledge of the involvement of microbes in the initiation of, and also potentially the perpetuation of, tissue inflammation, these effects may prove to be a fundamental part of their action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31422221>Sewage sludge composting under semi-permeable film at full-scale: Evaluation of odour emissions and relationships between microbiological activities and physico-chemical variables.</a></h2><p>In the present study, physico-chemical characteristics, heavy metals content, odour emissions, microbial enumeration and enzymatic activities were analysed during industrial scale composting of sewage sludge partially pre-treated to evaluate the effect of a combined system of semi-permeable film and aeration on these parameters. The results related to physico-chemical parameters showed a decrease in total organic carbon (TOC), organic matter (OM), total carbon (TC) along the process. Volatile solids (VS) were also reduced, reaching 36% at 120 days, which is above the limit according to the current legislation. Similarly, metal content was found to be an important variable in the evolution of enzymatic activity, while lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), and nickel (Ni) were the most influential. Moreover, heavy metals were found below the limit of type  compost quality or European class 2 at the end of the process, which is suitable for agriculture soil. The odorous impact generated during the hydrolytic stage was reduced to an average value of 4 ou/s. This suggests that, covered stage with the semi-permeable film, could be a viable solution to mitigate odour emissions. The highest temperature was reached at 10 days and it was favoured by semi-permeable film. Temperature promoted the presence of thermophilic bacteria and fungi and indicated an early biodegradation process mediated by microorganisms. Statistical analyses revealed a high correlation of physico-chemical variables with microbial activity. Thus, samples from the first 14 days were highly correlated with enzymatic activities such as β-glucosidase (Ac-βGlu), protease (Ac-Pr), and dehydrogenase (Ac-De), which have usually been involved in the hydrolysis of organic matter.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The orthogonal experiment in vitro showed that the ZEA degradation rate was 92.27% ( < 0.05) under the conditions that ,  SP1, and  SP2 were mixed together at 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.0%. When cell-free extracts from  were combined with the above probiotics at a ratio of 2:1 to make mycotoxin-biodegradation preparation (MBP), the ZEA degradation rate reached 95.15% ( < 0.05). In order to further investigate the MBP effect on relieving the negative impact of ZEA for pig production performance, 120 young pigs were randomly divided into 5 groups, with 3 replicates in each group and 8 pigs for each replicate. Group A was given the basal diet with 86.19 μg/kg ZEA; group  contained 300 μg/kg ZEA without MBP addition; and groups C, D, and E contained 300 μg/kg ZEA added with 0.05%, 0.10%, and 0.15% MBP, respectively. The results showed that MBP addition was able to keep gut  stable. ZEA concentrations in jejunal contents in groups A and D were 89.47% and 80.07% lower than that in group  ( < 0.05), indicating that MBP was effective in ZEA biodegradation. In addition, MBP had no significant effect on pig growth, nutrient digestibility, and the relative mRNA abundance of estrogen receptor alpha () genes in ovaries and the uterus ( > 0.05).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500297>Development of an UPLC-MS/MS Method for the Analysis of Mycotoxins in Rumen Fluid with and without Maize Silage Emphasizes the Importance of Using Matrix-Matched Calibration.</a></h2><p>Ruminants are less susceptible to the effects of mycotoxins than monogastric animals as their rumen  are claimed to degrade and/or deactivate at least some of these toxic compounds. However, the mycotoxin degradation is not well-known yet. For this, a sensitive, specific, and accurate analytical method is needed to determine mycotoxins in the rumen fluid. This study aims to develop and thoroughly validate an ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantitative determination in the rumen fluid of some of the most relevant mycotoxins found in maize silage in Western Europe: deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), zearalenone (ZEN), mycophenolic acid (MPA), roquefortine C (ROQ-C) and enniatin  (ENN ), as well as their metabolites deepoxy-deoxynivalenol (DOM-1), α-zearalenol (α-ZEL), β-zearalenol (β-ZEL), zearalanone (ZAN), α-zearalanol (α-ZAL) and β-zearalanol (β-ZAL). As feed is often present in the rumen fluid samples, the potential interaction of feed particles with the mycotoxin extraction and analysis was investigated. Extraction recovery and matrix effects were determined in the rumen fluid with and without maize silage. Differences in those parameters between rumen fluid alone and rumen fluid with maize silage highlight the importance of using matrix-matched calibration curves for the quantification of mycotoxins in rumen fluid samples. A cross-validation of the method with rumen fluid and maize silage demonstrates that this analytical method can be applied in research on rumen fluid samples to investigate the degradation of the reported mycotoxins by rumen  if matrix-matched calibration is performed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487844>Milk and Meat Allergens from  β-Lactoglobulin, α-Casein, and Bovine Serum Albumin: An In-Vivo Study of the Immune Response in Mice.</a></h2><p>The mechanism of food allergy may vary. This study aimed to compare the effects of milk, yogurt, or beef meat supplementation on humoral and cellular immune responses in a mice model. Mice were divided into four groups: The "Milk group" was sensitized with a β-lactoglobulin (β-lg)/α-casein (α-CN) mixture and supplemented cow milk; the "Yogurt group" was sensitized with β-lg/α-CN and supplemented yogurt; the "Beef group" was immunized with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and supplemented beef meat; and the "PBS group" received PBS in all procedures. ELISA was used to measure humoral response, including: Total IgE, specific IgG, and IgA. Cellular response was determined by phenotyping lymphocyte from lymphoid tissue and measuring the Th1/Th2 cytokine concentration with flow cytometry. The qPCR method was used for quantification of the fecal . The results obtained revealed a lower IgE level for the Yogurt group than for the Milk one. In the Yogurt group, the contribution of regulatory T cells to MLN and PP was higher compared to the other groups. We confirmed that diet supplementation with yogurt modulates the immune response to the prime allergen, and changes the activity of serum antibodies to milk proteins and BSA. Based on a specific antibodies level, we cannot exclude the possibility of CMA mice reaction against BSA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508436>Evaluation of the Antimicrobial and Anti-inflammatory Properties of -DFM (Norum™) in Broiler Chickens Infected With  Enteritidis.</a></h2><p>Restrictions of in-feed antibiotics use in poultry has pushed research toward finding appropriate alternatives such as Direct-Fed Microbials (DFM). In this study, previously tested  isolates (.  and . ) were used to evaluate their therapeutic and prophylactic effects against  serovar Enteritidis (. Enteritidis) in broiler chickens. For this purpose, initial antibacterial activity of -DFM (10 spores/g or 10 spores/g) against . Enteritidis colonization in crop, proventriculus and intestine was investigated using an  digestive model. Furthermore, to evaluate therapeutic and prophylactic effects of -DFM (10 spores/g) against . Enteritidis colonization, altogether 60 ( = 30/group) and 30 ( = 15/group) 1-day-old broiler chickens were randomly allocated to either DFM or control group (without -DFM), respectively. Chickens were orally gavaged with 10 cfu of . Enteritidis per chicken at 1-day old, and cecal tonsils (CT) and crop were collected 3 and 10 days later during the therapeutic study, whereas they were orally gavaged with 10 cfu of . Enteritidis per chicken at 6-day-old, and CT and crop were collected 24 h later from two independent trials during the prophylactic study. Serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), FITC-d and intestinal IgA levels were reported for both chicken studies, in addition cecal  analysis was performed during the therapeutic study. DFM significantly reduced . Enteritidis concentration in the intestine compartment, and in both proventriculus and intestine compartments as compared to the control when used at 10 spores/g and 10 spores/g, respectively ( < 0.05). DFM significantly reduced FITC-d and IgA as well as SOD and IgA levels ( < 0.05) compared to the control in therapeutic and prophylactic studies, respectively. Interestingly, in the therapeutic study, there were significant differences in bacterial community structure and predicted metabolic pathways between DFM and control. Likewise, phylum  and the genera , and cc_115 were decreased, while the genus  was enriched significantly in the DFM group as compared to the control (MetagenomeSeq,  < 0.05). Thus, the overall results suggest that the -DFM can reduce . Enteritidis colonization and improve the intestinal health in chickens through mechanism(s) that might involve the modulation of gut  and their metabolic pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557668>Application of a novel molecular technique to characterise the effect of settling on microbial community composition of activated sludge.</a></h2><p>Activated sludge (AS) and return activated sludge (RAS) microbial communities from three full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants (denoted plant A,  and C) were compared to assess the impact of sludge settling (i.e. gravity thickening in the clarifier) and profile microorganisms responsible for nutrient removal and reactor foaming. The results show that all three plants were dominated with microbes in the phyla of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, Spirochaetae, Acidobacteria and Saccharibacteria. AS and RAS shared above 80% similarity in the microbial community composition, indicating that sludge thickening does not significantly alter the microbial composition. Autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrifiers were present in the AS. However, the abundance of autotrophic nitrifiers was significantly lower than that of the heterotrophic nitrifiers. Thus, ammonium removal at these plants was achieved mostly by heterotrophic nitrification. Microbes that can cause foaming were at 3.2% abundance, and this result is well corroborated with occasional aerobic biological reactor foaming. By contrast, these microbes were not abundant (<2.1%) at plant A and C, where aerobic biological reactor foaming has not been reported.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have revealed that IGV SHM creates neoantigens that activate T-cell responses against -cell lymphoma.To determine the clinical relevance of IGV SHM in DLBCL treated with standard immunochemotherapy, we performed next-generation sequencing of the immunoglobulin variable regions and complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) for 378 patients with de novo DLBCL. The prognostic effects of IGV SHM and ongoing SHM or intra-clonal heterogeneity were analyzed in the training (192 patients), validation (186 patients), and overall DLBCL cohorts. To gain mechanistic insight, we analyzed the predicted IG-derived neoantigens' immunogenicity potential, determined by the major histocompatibility complex-binding affinity and the frequency-of-occurrence of T cell-exposed motifs (TCEMs) in a TCEM repertoire derived from human proteome, , and pathogen databases. Furthermore, IGV SHM was correlated with molecular characteristics of DLBCL and PD-1/L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment assessed by fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry.SHM was commonly found in IGHV and less frequently in IGK/LV. High levels of clonal IGHV SHM (SHM) were associated with prolonged overall survival in DLBCL patients, particularly those without BCL2 or MYC translocation. In contrast, long heavy chain CDR3 length, the presence of IGHV ongoing SHM in DLBCL, and high clonal IGK/LV SHM in germinal center -cell-like (GCB)-DLBCL were associated with poor prognosis. These prognostic effects were significant in both the training and validation sets. By prediction, the SHM groups harbored more potentially immune-stimulatory neoantigens with high binding affinity and rare TCEMs. PD-1/L1 expression in CD8 T cells was significantly lower in IGHV SHM than in SHM patients with activated -cell-like DLBCL, whereas PD-1 expression in CD4 T cells and PD-L1 expression in natural killer cells were higher in IGK/LV SHM than in SHM patients with GCB-DLBCL. PD-L1/L2 (9p24.1) amplification was associated with high IGHV SHM and ongoing SHM.These results show for the first time that IGV SHM and ongoing SHM have prognostic effects in DLBCL and potential implications for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and neoantigen-based immunotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634771>The depressogenic potential of added dietary sugars.</a></h2><p>Added sugars are ubiquitous in contemporary Western diets. Although excessive sugar consumption is now robustly associated with an array of adverse health consequences, comparatively little research has thus far addressed its impact on the risk of mental illness. But ample evidence suggests that high-dose sugar intake can perturb numerous metabolic, inflammatory, and neurobiological processes. Many such effects are of particular relevance to the onset and maintenance of depressive illness, among them: systemic inflammation, gut  disruption, perturbed dopaminergic reward signaling, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and the generation of toxic advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Accordingly, we hypothesize that added dietary sugars carry the potential to increase vulnerability to major depressive disorder, particularly at high levels of consumption. The present paper: (a) summarizes the existing experimental and epidemiological research regarding sugar consumption and depression vulnerability; () examines the impact of sugar ingestion on known depressogenic physiological processes; and (c) outlines the clinical and theoretical implications of the apparent sugar-depression link. We conclude that the extant literature supports the hypothesized depressogenic impact of added dietary sugars, and propose that an improved understanding of the effects of sugar on body and mind may aid in the development of novel therapeutic and preventative measures for depression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Days 22 to 42, BW and ADG were higher (p < .05) in pigs fed T2 diet than CON and T1 diets, and the pigs fed T1 diet had higher BW than CON treatment. Overall, the ADG with the T2 treatment was higher (p < .05) than that with the T1 and CON treatments, and pigs offered T1 treatment had higher (p < .05) ADG than CON treatment. Moreover, F:G ratio were significantly decreased (p < .05) by T2 treatment compared with CON treatment. The faecal Lactobacillus counts were improved, and E. coli counts were reduced (p < .05) in pigs fed T2 diet compared with CON at the end of the experiment.

To assess the degree of variance in these distributions, fecal and soil samples were collected from six distinct housing areas on commercial dairy farms (n = 7) in Washington State. 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that the  differed between different on-farm locations in feces and soil, and in both cases, the  of dairy calves was often distinct from others (P < 0.05). Thirty-two specific antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were widely distributed on dairies, of which several clinically relevant ARGs (including cfr, cfrB, and optrA) were identified for the first time at U.S. dairies. Overall, ARGs were observed more frequently in feces and soil from dairy calves and heifers than from hospital, fresh, lactation and dry pens. Droplet-digital PCR demonstrated that the absolute abundance of floR varied greatly across housing areas and this gene was enriched the most in calves and heifers. Furthermore, in an extended analysis with 14 dairies, environmental soils in calf pens had the most antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli followed by heifer and hospital pens. All soil E. coli isolates (n = 1,905) are resistant to at least 4 different antibiotics, and the PFGE analysis indicated that florfenicol-resistant E. coli is probably shared across geographically-separated farms. This study identified a discrete but predictable distribution of antibiotic resistance genes and organisms, which is important for designing mitigation for higher risk areas on dairy farms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Fucoidans are found only in brown algae. These polysaccharides exhibit a wide spectrum of biological activity and have a great therapeutic potential. Enzymes capable of catalyzing the degradation of fucoidans are absent in the mammalian enzyme system. The question arises: is the transformation of fucoidan in mammals, particularly in human possible? Studies in vivo (in situ) and in vitro have demonstrated that high molecular weight fucoidans are absorbed across rat intestinal epithelial cells, accumulated by liver macrophages, and characterized by low levels in blood and urine. Using the example of the Okinawa Prefecture (Japan) residents, it was shown that Cladosiphon okamuranus alga is digested and the fucoidan contained in this alga is absorbed in the human body.Copyright © 2019.

Intestinal community and metabolic profiles were characterized to establish their potential interactions during liver regeneration.Partial hepatectomy caused fluctuating changes in gut , which paralleled the biological processes of LR. Briefly, the enhanced cell proliferation occurring within 30-48 h was associated with a decreased ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes reflected by a reduction in Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, while an increase in Bacteroidaceae, Rikenellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae, which was indicative of a lean phenotype.

In contrast, the  derived from day 2 rats was functionally unique in "replication and repair", "amino acid metabolism" and "nucleoid metabolism". Upon examining the dynamic pattern of metabolic response, the specific pathways including glycerophospholipid metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism were identified to be attributable to the systemic alterations in LR related-metabolism.

The composition of  varies from host to host, and it changes during the lifetime. It is known that  may be changed because of a diet, bacteriophages and different processes for example, such as inflammation. Like all other areas of medicine, there is a continuous growth in the area of microbiology. Different microbes can reside in all sites of a human body, even in locations that were previously considered as sterile; for example, liver, pancreas, brain and adipose tissue. Presently one of the etiological factors for liver disease is considered to be pro-inflammatory changes in a host's organism. There are lot of supporting data about intestinal dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability and its effect on development of liver disease pointing to the gut-liver axis. The gut-liver axis affects pathogenesis of many liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis , chronic hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Gut  has been implicated in the regulation of brain health, emphasizing the gut-brain axis. Also, experiments with mice showed that microorganisms have significant effects on the blood-brain barrier integrity.  can modulate a variety of mechanisms through the gut-liver axis and gut-brain axis. Normal intestinal flora impacts the health of a host in many positive ways, but there is now significant evidence that intestinal , especially altered, have the ability to impact the pathologies of many diseases through different inflammatory mechanisms.

Modulation of the functions of immune cells in different environments is crucial for managing infection and inferior bone integration via immunomodulation. In this work, sodium butyrate, a fermentation product of gut , was loaded onto 3D porous sulfonated polyetheretherketone (SP) to modulate the immune responses of cells in different environments. Evaluation of in vitro antibacterial effects showed that sodium butyrate-loaded SP exhibited superior antibacterial activity, especially in the samples containing high concentrations of sodium butyrate. Under bacterial stimulation, the phagocytic activity of macrophages increased with an increase in the sodium butyrate concentration via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which favoured bactericidal activity in the implant-associated infection stage. For bacterial elimination, sodium butyrate-containing SP could polarize macrophages to the M2 phenotype and subsequently stimulate anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, which is considered beneficial for bone regeneration in the tissue repair stage. In vitro osteogenesis was evaluated and the results demonstrated that treatment with sodium butyrate-containing SP increased the expression of osteogenic genes and proteins. An in vivo rat osteomyelitis model was used to evaluate the protective effect of the SP-loaded with sodium butyrate on bone destruction and osteolysis under infection conditions. To study osteogenesis in vivo, a rat femoral model without infection was used. The results indicated that the SP-B2 group exhibited superior anti-infection capacity and induced new bone formation around the implant in vivo. Treatment with sodium butyrate-containing porous SP modulated the macrophage response under different stimuli, thereby serving as a new approach for the design of smart implant materials with superior antibacterial and bone repair properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635446> P2P3, a human gut bacterium having a strong non-gelatinized resistant starch-degrading activity.</a></h2><p>Resistant starch (RS) is metabolized by gut  and involved in the production of short chain fatty acids, which are related to a variety of physiological and health effects. Therefore, the availability of RS as a prebiotic is a topic of interest and research on gut bacteria that can decompose RS is also important. The objectives in this study were 1) to isolate human gut bacterium having strong degradation activity on non-gelatinized RS, 2) to characterize its RS-degrading characteristics, and 3) to investigate its probiotic effects including a growth stimulation effect on other gut bacteria and an immunomodulatory effect.  P2P3 showing very strong RS granule utilization activity was isolated. It can attach to RS granules and form the clusters of RS granules. Also, it was able to utilize high amylose corn starch (HACS) granules up to 63.3%, and efficiently decompose other various types of commercial RS without gelatinization. In a coculture experiment,  ATCC 29148, isolated from human feces, were capable to grow using carbon sources generated from RS granules by  P2P3. In addition,  P2P3 demonstrated the ability to stimulate secretion of Th1 type cytokines from mouse macrophages  that was not shown in other .

AR bacteria can be acquired in early life and have long-term sequelae. Limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance without triggering the development of additional resistance mechanisms is of immense clinical value. Here, we show how the infant gut  can be modified, resulting in a significant reduction of AR genes (ARGs) and the potentially pathogenic bacteria that harbor them.The gut  was characterized using shotgun metagenomics of fecal samples from two groups of healthy, term breastfed infants. One group was fed  EVC001 in addition to receiving lactation support ( = 29, EVC001-fed), while the other received lactation support alone ( = 31, controls). Coliforms were isolated from fecal samples and genome sequenced, as well as tested for minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics.Infants fed  EVC001 exhibited a change to the gut , resulting in a 90% lower level of ARGs compared to controls. ARGs that differed significantly between groups were predicted to confer resistance to beta lactams, fluoroquinolones, or multiple drug classes, the majority of which belonged to ,  and . Minimal inhibitory concentration assays confirmed the resistance phenotypes among isolates with these genes. Notably, we found extended-spectrum beta lactamases among healthy, vaginally delivered breastfed infants who had never been exposed to antibiotics.Colonization of the gut of breastfed infants by a single strain of  subsp.  had a profound impact on the fecal metagenome, including a reduction in ARGs. This highlights the importance of developing novel approaches to limit the spread of these genes among clinically relevant bacteria.

We then determined the full genome sequence of this strain, and employed the generated data to analyze fucosyllactose metabolism in . kashiwanohense APCKJ1. Transcriptomic and growth analyses, combined with metabolite analysis, in vitro hydrolysis assays and heterologous expression, allowed us to elucidate the pathway for fucosyllactose metabolism in . kashiwanohense APCKJ1. Homologs of the key genes for this metabolic pathway were identified in particular in infant-derived members of the Bifdobacterium genus, revealing the apparent niche-specific nature of this pathway, and allowing a broad perspective on bifidobacterial fucosyllactose and L-fucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31437574>Inhibition of Escherichia coli adhesion to human intestinal Caco-2 cells by probiotic candidate Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15.</a></h2><p>Probiotics are microbial strains beneficial to human health if consumed in appropriate amounts. Their potential has recently led to a significant increase in research interest in their effects on the intestine, mainly by reinforcing the intestinal epithelium and modulating the gut . This study aimed to evaluate the probiotic features of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 based on adhesive properties for the inhibition of the adhesion of infectious pathogens. The molecular identification of the strain was performed from the sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA with 27FYM and 1492R primers, and its probiotic features, including resistance to gastric juices, resistance to bile salts, and hydrophobicity were evaluated. The potential of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 to adhere to human adenocarcinoma intestinal cell line, Caco-2, as well as the auto and co-aggregation and anti-adherence activity against Escherichia coli were investigated. The results demonstrated that this strain has a desirable potential for passing through the low pH of the stomach and entering the intestines. Moreover, 54% hydrophobicity, 44% auto-aggregation, and 32% co-aggregation were observed for this strain. The adhesion level of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 to Caco-2 cells was 12%, and adhered lactobacilli cells were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, this strain showed appropriate anti-adherence effects, including competition, inhibition, and replacement properties against Escherichia coli. The results indicated that Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 had good potential for exerting antagonistic effects against E. coli.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

But it still remains unknown whether alcoholism is involved in changes in gut  and its underlying mechanism is also not clear. Here, we tested the gut  of patients with alcoholism and conducted fecal  transplantation (FMT) from patients with alcoholism to C57BL/6J mice whose gut  had been sharply suppressed with antibiotics (ABX). Then we evaluated their alcohol preference degree, anxiety, and depression-like behaviors and social interaction behaviors, together with molecular changes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Our data indicated that the gut  of patients with alcoholism was drastically different from those of the healthy adults. The abundance of p_Firmicutes was significantly increased whereas p_Bacteroidetes was decreased. Compared to mice transplanted with fecal  from healthy male adults, the mice accepting fecal  from patients with alcoholism showed (a) anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors, () decreased social interaction behaviors, (c) spontaneous alcohol preference, and (d) decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), alpha 1 subunit of GABA type A receptor (α1GABA R) in mPFC and decreased metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 (mGluR1), protein kinase C (PKC) ε in NAc. Overall, our results suggest that fecal  from patients with alcoholism did induce a status like alcohol dependence in C57BL/6J mice. The decreased expression of BDNF, α1GABA R, and mGluR1/ PKC ε may be the underlying mechanism.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522353>Methanogenic Archaea: Emerging Partners in the Field of Allergic Diseases.</a></h2><p>Archaea, which form one of four domains of life alongside Eukarya, Bacteria, and giant viruses, have long been neglected as components of the human  and potential opportunistic infectious pathogens. In this review, we focus on methanogenic Archaea, which rely on hydrogen for their metabolism and growth. On one hand, methanogenic Archaea in the gut are functional associates of the fermentative digestion of dietary fibers, favoring the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids and likely contributing to the weaning reaction during the neonatal window of opportunity. On the other hand, methanogenic Archaea trigger the activation of innate and adaptive responses and the generation of specific T and  cells in animals and humans. In mouse models, lung hypersensitivity reactions can be induced by inhaled methanogenic Archaea mimicking human professional exposure to organic dust. Changes in methanogenic Archaea of the  are detected in an array of dysimmune conditions comprising inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, malnutrition, anorexia, colorectal cancer, and diverticulosis. At the subcellular level, methanogenic Archaea are activators of the TLR8-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome, modulate the release of antimicrobial peptides and drive the production of proinflammatory, Th-1, Th-2, and Th-17 cytokines. Our objective was to introduce the most recent and major pieces of evidence supporting the involvement of Archaea in the balance between health and dysimmune diseases, with a particular focus on atopic and allergic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402861>Formononetin: A Review of Its Anticancer Potentials and Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Cancer, a complex yet common disease, is caused by uncontrolled cell division and abnormal cell growth due to a variety of gene mutations. Seeking effective treatments for cancer is a major research focus, as the incidence of cancer is on the rise and drug resistance to existing anti-cancer drugs is major concern. Natural products have the potential to yield unique molecules and combinations of substances that may be effective against cancer with relatively low toxicity/better side effect profile compared to standard anticancer therapy. Drug discovery work with natural products has demonstrated that natural compounds display a wide range of biological activities correlating to anticancer effects. In this review, we discuss formononetin (CHO), which originates mainly from red clovers and the Chinese herb . The compound comes from a class of 7-hydroisoflavones with a substitution of methoxy group at position 4. Formononetin elicits antitumorigenic properties  and  by modulating numerous signaling pathways to induce cell apoptosis (by intrinsic pathway involving Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 proteins) and cell cycle arrest (by regulating mediators like cyclin A, cyclin B1, and cyclin D1), suppress cell proliferation [by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase- (PI3K/AKT), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway], and inhibit cell invasion [by regulating growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 proteins]. Co-treatment with other chemotherapy drugs such as bortezomib, LY2940002, U0126, sunitinib, epirubicin, doxorubicin, temozolomide, and metformin enhances the anticancer potential of both formononetin and the respective drugs through synergistic effect. Compiling the evidence thus far highlights the potential of formononetin to be a promising candidate for chemoprevention and chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31395952>Horizontally transmitted symbiont populations in deep-sea mussels are genetically isolated.</a></h2><p>Eukaryotes are habitats for bacterial organisms where the host colonization and dispersal among individual hosts have consequences for the bacterial ecology and evolution. Vertical symbiont transmission leads to geographic isolation of the microbial population and consequently to genetic isolation of microbiotas from individual hosts. In contrast, the extent of geographic and genetic isolation of horizontally transmitted  is poorly characterized. Here we show that chemosynthetic symbionts of individual Bathymodiolus brooksi mussels constitute genetically isolated subpopulations. The reconstruction of core genome-wide strains from high-resolution metagenomes revealed distinct phylogenetic clades. Nucleotide diversity and strain composition vary along the mussel life span and individual hosts show a high degree of genetic isolation. Our results suggest that the uptake of environmental bacteria is a restricted process in . brooksi, where self-infection of the gill tissue results in serial founder effects during symbiont evolution. We conclude that bacterial colonization dynamics over the host life cycle is thus an important determinant of population structure and genome evolution of horizontally transmitted symbionts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565636>Maxillary Osteomyelitis with an Incidental Diagnosis of Maxillary Diffuse Large -Cell Lymphoma: A Case Report.</a></h2><p>Raoultella planticola osteomyelitis is rarely reported in the literature. The most likely source in our case is the oral  secondary to the tooth extraction. Herein we present a case of Raoultella planticola osteomyelitis of the jaw that leads to the diagnosis of diffuse large -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the jaw. A 75-year-old male with no significant medical history, presented to the emergency department with right upper jaw pain after he had a tooth extraction a week before his presentation. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the face showed concerns of right maxillary osteomyelitis with soft tissue swelling and prominent cervical lymph nodes. He underwent a bone biopsy of the maxilla and was started on intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam. His bone culture grew pan-sensitive Raoultella planticola. in addition to that, his bone biopsy revealed diffuse large -cell lymphoma of the jaw. The patient underwent staging imaging, and he was found to have metastasis to the liver. He was started on chemotherapy and had a good response. In conclusion, Raoultella planticola osteomyelitis is extremely rare. The diagnosis of maxillary DLBCL can be a challenge.

The emerging field of microbial endocrinology offers innovative perspectives and methods to analyze host-microbe relationships with relevance to primate ecology, evolution, and conservation. Herein we briefly summarize key findings from microbial endocrinology and explore how applications of a similar framework could inform our understanding of primate stress and reproductive physiology and behavior. We conclude with three guiding hypotheses to further investigate endocrine signaling between gut microbes and the host: (a) host-microbe communication systems promote microbe-mediated stability, in which the microbes are using endocrine signaling from the host to maintain a functioning habitat for their own fitness, () host-microbe communication systems promote host-mediated stability, in which the host uses the endocrine system to monitor microbial communities and alter these communities to maintain stability, or (c) host-microbe systems are simply the product of coincidental cross-talk between the host and microbes due to similar molecules from shared ancestry.

To fill this gap, we captured House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) from rural and urban environments and hypothesized that increased access to human refuse in urban areas may significantly alter the gut  and nutritional physiology of Sparrows. While there were no significant differences in circulating triglycerides or free glycerol concentrations between populations, urban birds had significantly greater blood glucose concentrations, which suggests greater circulating glucagon concentrations, accessibility to carbohydrates, and/or higher rates of gluconeogenesis in an urban setting. Rural birds had significantly more plasma uric acid, suggesting that they may metabolize more proteins or experience lower inflammation than urban birds. Rural birds also had significantly higher liver free glycerol concentrations, indicating that they metabolize more fat than urban birds. There were no significant differences in the relative abundance of gut microbial taxa at the phyla level between the two populations, but linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that urban House Sparrows were more enriched with class- and order-level microbes from the phylum Proteobacteria, which are implicated in several mammalian intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. These findings demonstrate that urbanization significantly alters the nutritional physiology and the composition of the gut  of House Sparrows.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Most members of the root  possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root , including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root . In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root , as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal  were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/ index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic  to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The ghrelin receptor [growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)-1a] is a GPCR expressed throughout both the gut and the brain and plays a crucial role in maintaining energy balance, metabolism, and the central modulation of food intake, motivation, reward, and mood. To date, few studies have investigated the potential of the gastrointestinal  and its metabolites to modulate GPCR signaling. Here we investigate the ability of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lactate, and different bacterial strains, including  and  genera, to modulate GHSR-1a signaling. We identify, for what is to our knowledge the first time, a potent effect of -derived metabolites on GHSR-1a signaling with potential significant consequences for host metabolism and physiology. We show that SCFAs, lactate, and bacterial supernatants are able to attenuate ghrelin-mediated signaling through the GHSR-1a. We suggest a novel route of communication between the gut  and the host  modulation of GHSR-1a receptor signaling.

Here, we comprehensively investigated the larval gut  of  in two field populations from Zigui (developed in orange) and Danjiangkou (developed in mandarin orange). We observed a dominance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in these bacterial communities, and Enterobacteriaceae was the predominant family throughout the larval stage.

Although there was a difference in the structure of the microbial communities between the two populations, the dynamic change patterns of most of the members of the  were similar across the lifespan of larvae in both populations. The relative abundances of the Acetobacteraceae, Leuconostocaceae, and Lactobacillaceae gut bacteria as well as the Pichiaceae, Sebacinaceae, and Amanitaceae fungi increased throughout development, and these microorganisms stably resided in the larval gut. Furthermore, the dynamic changes of the functions of gut bacterial communities were inferred, and there was a significant increase in carbohydrate metabolism across the lifespan of larvae in both groups.

We demonstrated that high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding causes intestinal metaplasia, which are precancerous lesions of the stomach, with augmented gastric leptin signaling. The aim of this study was to investigate the precise role of leptin signaling in the altered  composition and pathogenesis in the stomach during diet-induced obesity.Male C57 BL/6 J, leptin receptor (Lepr)-mutated db/db, and gastrointestinal epithelium-specific Lepr conditional knockout (T3 -Lepr cKO) mice were fed a HFD or control diet. Gastrointestinal  was analyzed by 16 S rRNA gene sequences and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transplantation of gastric  of HFD-fed mice was performed to evaluate metaplasia onset in recipient mice.One week of HFD caused severe microbial dysbiosis in the stomach. The  changes were accompanied by increased gastric leptin, leading to the consequent development of intestinal metaplasia. Transplantation of gastric  from HFD-fed mice induced intestinal metaplasia in recipient mice; however, only a limited effect on pathogenesis was noted. HFD-fed db/db mice did not show a decrease in microbial abundance.

A four-strained consortium of commensal bacteria that contains Blautia producta BP can reverse antibiotic-induced susceptibility to VRE infection. Here we show that BP reduces growth of VRE by secreting a lantibiotic that is similar to the nisin-A produced by Lactococcus lactis. Although the growth of VRE is inhibited by BP and L. lactis in vitro, only BP colonizes the colon and reduces VRE density in vivo. In comparison to nisin-A, the BP lantibiotic has reduced activity against intestinal commensal bacteria. In patients at high risk of VRE infection, high abundance of the lantibiotic gene is associated with reduced density of E. faecium. In germ-free mice transplanted with patient-derived faeces, resistance to VRE colonization correlates with abundance of the lantibiotic gene.

For this reason, it is generally considered an important threat to the dairy industry. Many microbial, host, and environmental factors can protect against, predispose to, or influence the development of mastitis. The objective of this work was to characterize the milk  of Manchega ewes, and to compare samples from animals with and without a history of mastitis. We analyzed milk samples from 36 ewes belonging to 2 different farms (18 ewes from each farm) using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. We also analyzed several immune compounds to investigate associations of mastitis with 3 main variables: farm; history of mastitis or no mastitis; and parity number. Both culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques showed that ewe milk harbored a site-specific complex  and . Staphylococcus epidermidis was the main species driving the difference between farm A (where it was the dominant species) and  (where it was not). In contrast, samples from farm  were characterized by the presence of a wide spectrum of other coagulase-negative staphylococci. Some of these species have already been associated with subclinical intramammary infections in ruminants. Of the 10 immune compounds assayed in this study, 3 were related to a history of mastitis [IL-8, IFN-γ, and IFN-gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10)]. Increases in IL-8 concentrations in milk seemed to be a feature of subclinical mastitis in sheep, and in this study, this immune factor was detected only in samples from ewes with some episodes of mastitis and from the group with the highest somatic cell count. We also observed a positive correlation between the samples with the highest somatic cell count and IFN-γ and IP-10 levels. Our results suggest that these 3 compounds could be used as biomarkers for the negative selection of mastitis-prone animals, particularly when somatic cell count is very high.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Memory  and T cells initiate a rapid and robust immune response upon encounter with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, thus achieving long-lasting protection against infection. Recent studies have shown, however, that innate immune cell populations such as myeloid cells and NK cells also undergo functional adaptation after infection or vaccination, a de facto innate immune memory that is also termed trained immunity. Experimental and epidemiological data have shown that induction of trained immunity contributes to the beneficial heterologous effects of vaccines such as bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the licensed TB vaccine. Moreover, increasing evidence argues that trained immunity also contributes to the anti-TB effects of BCG vaccination. An interaction among immunological signals, metabolic rewiring, and epigenetic reprogramming underlies the molecular mechanisms mediating trained immunity in myeloid cells and their bone marrow progenitors. Future studies are warranted to explore the untapped potential of trained immunity to develop a future generation of TB vaccines that would combine innate and adaptive immune memory induction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562947>Molecular ecology of the yet uncultured bacterial Ct85-cluster in the mammalian gut.</a></h2><p>In our previous studies on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) -associated  by molecular methods, we demonstrated that a particular 16S rRNA gene amplicon was more abundant in the feces of healthy subjects or mixed type IBS (IBS-M) -sufferers than in the feces of individuals with diarrhea-type IBS (IBS-D).

Various Ct85-cluster sequence types were detected in the fecal samples of several companion and production animal species with remarkably differing prevalences and abundances. The Ct85 sequence type composition of swine closely resembled that of humans. One of the five types (d) shared between humans and swine was not present in any other animals tested, while one sequence type () was found only in human samples. In both IBS study cohorts, one type (e) was more prevalent in healthy individuals than in the IBS-M group. By revealing various sequence types in the widespread Ct85-cluster and their distribution, the results improve our understanding of these uncultured bacteria, which is essential for future efforts to cultivate representatives of the Ct85-cluster and reveal their roles in IBS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Cows from 3 dairy farms with (n = 23) and without (n = 12) udder sore lesions were enrolled, and punch biopsies (23 lesions, 23 negative control samples of cows with lesions, and 12 control samples of cows without lesions) were collected. The biopsies were evaluated histopathologically, and their 16S metagenome was analyzed. No signs of mange or viral or fungal infections were detected histopathologically in any samples. The α diversity of microbial populations decreased in lesions, across all farms, and the abundance of spirochaetes did not notably change, compared with controls. However, compared with control samples, the microbial fractions of Fusobacterium, Helcococcus spp., Anaerococcus spp., Porphyromonas spp., Prevotella spp., and Trueperella spp. increased several-fold in lesions. In summary, our results suggest that spirochaetes, viruses, and mange are unlikely to cause udder sores. Instead, sores were associated with a marked increase in the abundance of Fusobacterium, Helcococcus, Anaerococcus, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Trueperella. Future studies are needed to determine which of these bacteria initiates this polymicrobial infection.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, little is known regarding the role of PI3Kδ on IL-10-producing  cells that help regulate mucosal inflammation in IBD. We investigated the role of PI3Kδ signaling in  cell production of IL-10, following stimulation by resident bacteria and  cell regulatory function against colitis. In vitro,  cells from PI3Kδ mice or wild-type  cells treated with PI3K specific inhibitors secreted significantly less IL-10 with greater IL-12p40 following bacterial stimulation. These  cells failed to suppress inflammatory cytokines by co-cultured -activated macrophages or CD4 T cells. In vivo, co-transferred wild-type  cells ameliorated T cell-mediated colitis, while PI3Kδ  cells did not confer protection from mucosal inflammation. These results indicate that PI3Kδ-signaling mediates regulatory  cell immune differentiation when stimulated with resident  or their components, and is critical for induction and regulatory function of IL-10-producing  cells in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623169>Urolithin Metabotypes Can Determine the Modulation of Gut  in Healthy Individuals by Tracking Walnuts Consumption over Three Days.</a></h2><p>Walnuts are rich in polyphenols ellagitannins, modulate gut  (GM), and exert health benefits after long-term consumption. The metabolism of ellagitannins to urolithins via GM depends on urolithin metabotypes (UM-A, -, or -0), which have been reported to predict host responsiveness to a polyphenol-rich intervention. This study aims to assess whether UMs were associated with differential GM modulation after short-term walnut consumption. In this study, 27 healthy individuals consumed 33 g of peeled raw walnuts over three days. GM profiling was determined using 16S rRNA illumina sequencing and specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs), as well as microbial activity using short-chain fatty acids analysis in stool samples. UMs stratification of volunteers was assessed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-electro spray ionization-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) analysis of urolithins in urine samples. The gut  associated with UM- was more sensitive to the walnut intervention. , and members of the Coriobacteriaceae family, including , increased exclusively in UM- subjects, while some members of the Lachnospiraceae family decreased in UM-A individuals.  and  increased in both UMs and higher acetate and propionate production resulted after walnuts intake. Our results show that walnuts consumption after only three days modulates GM in a urolithin metabotype-depending manner and increases the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484434> L.

For instance, , ,  and  cause significant losses in nurseries and in forest ecosystems. Chemical treatments, while harmful to the environment and human health, have been proved to have little or no impact on these species. Recently, biocontrol bacterial species were used to cope with these pathogens and have shown promising prospects towards sustainable and eco-friendly agricultural practices. Olive trees prone to  and  disease outbreaks are suitable for habitat-adapted symbiotic strategies, to recover oomycetes and fungal pathogen biocontrol agents. Using this strategy, we showed that olive trees-associated  represents a valuable source for microorganisms, promoting plant growth and healthy benefits in addition to being biocontrol agents against oomycete and fungal diseases. Isolation, characterization and screening of root  of olive trees against numerous  and other fungal pathogens have led to the identification of the  OEE1, with plant growth promotion (PGP) abilities and strong activity against major oomycete and fungal pathogens. Phylogenomic analysis of the strain OEE1 showed that  suffers taxonomic imprecision that blurs species delimitation, impacting their biofertilizers' practical use. Genome mining of several  strains available in the GenBank have highlighted a wide array of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) features, metals and antibiotics resistance and the degradation ability of phytotoxic aromatic compounds. Strain OEE1 harbours a large repertoire of secreted and volatile secondary metabolites. Rarefaction analysis of secondary metabolites richness in the  genomes, unambiguously documented new secondary metabolites from ongoing genome sequencing efforts that warrants more efforts in order to assess the huge diversity in the species. Comparative genomics indicated that  harbours a core genome endowed with PGP features and accessory genome encoding diverse secondary metabolites. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of OEE1 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Liquid Chromatography High Resolution Mas Spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis of secondary metabolites identified numerous molecules with PGP abilities that are known to interfere with pathogen development. Moreover,  OEE1 proved effective in protecting olive trees against  in greenhouse experiments and are able to inhabit olive tree roots. Our strategy provides an effective means for isolation of biocontrol agents against recalcitrant pathogens.

Selenium (Se), a beneficial element of plant, improves plant resistance to pathogens, and regulates microbial communities in soil. Soil microbial communities has been identified to play an important role in plant health. We studied whether the changes in soil  under influence of Se associated with oilseed rape health. SSR disease incidence of oilseed rape and soil biochemical properties were investigated in Enshi district, "The World Capital of Selenium", and soil bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed by 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing, respectively. Results showed that Se had a strong effect on SSR incidence, and disease incidence inversely related with plant Se concentration. Besides, soil Se enhanced the  diversities and the relative abundance of PGPR (plant growth promoting rhizobacteria), such as Bryobacter, Nitrospirae, Rhizobiales, Xanthobacteraceae, Nitrosomonadaceae and Basidiomycota. Furthermore, Soil Se decreased the relative abundance of pathogenic fungi, such as Olpidium, Armillaria, Coniosporium, Microbotryomycetes and Chytridiomycetes. Additionally, Se increased nitrogen metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and cell processes related functional profiles in soil. The enrichment of Se in plants and improvement of soil microbial community were related to increased plant resistance to pathogen infection. These findings suggested that Se has potential to be developed as an ecological fungicide for biological control of SSR.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It also enlightens our understanding on the host-microbe interactions within the physiological context of a living host. However, the responses of GF zebrafish to various colonization conditions such as bacterial concentrations, colonization time points, and exposure duration remain unclear. To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations, colonization time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or 5 dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate, colonization efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate immunity, stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or 5 dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for 5 dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and immunity, while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to immunity and stress responses. Moreover, our data revealed that GF zebrafish showed higher levels of physical activity than CONR and the microbial colonization reduced the hyperactivity of GF zebrafish, suggesting colonization of bacteria affected behavior characteristics.

NXT is a fine powder mixture without any herb extraction, and there must be lots of ingredients hard to be absorbed. However, little is known about the correlation between the NXT's cardioprotective effects and gut . Herein, we report the effect of NXT on the development of cardiovascular diseases and clarify the correlation between NXT's cardioprotective effects and gut . In the current study, minipigs were selected and fed with high-fat diet and NXT daily for successive 8 months. During the process, up to 18 biomedical parameters were monthly determined to observe the dynamic changes after NXT treatment. At the end of experimental process, pathological examinations of heart, coronary artery, carotid artery, thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta were conducted by HE staining and 16SrDNA sequencing, and analyzing of gut  were conducted. Our results showed that NXT's effects against cardiovascular diseases were through regulating blood lipid profiles, inhibiting vascular inflammation, enhancing antioxidant capacity, and alleviating myocardial injury, without damages on liver and kidney particularly. Concurrently, we also found that long-term administration of NXT increased the diversity of gut , influenced the  structure and composition stably, and revered the increase of the ratio of the  to  (F/ ratio) in relative abundance. Specifically, our results revealed some key bacterium of , , , and  that were closely involved in NXT's effects.

Over the last decade, growing evidence has identified the gut  as a potential factor in the pathophysiology of both obesity and the related metabolic disorders. The gut  is known to protect gastrointestinal mucosa permeability and to regulate the fermentation and absorption of dietary polysaccharides, perhaps explaining its importance in the regulation of fat accumulation and the resultant obesity. The proposed mechanisms by which the gut  could contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and the related metabolic diseases include: (a) a high abundance of bacteria that ferment carbohydrates, leading to increased rates of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) biosynthesis, providing an extra source of energy for the host, that is eventually stored as lipids or glucose; () increased intestinal permeability to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), resulting in elevated systemic LPS levels that aggravate low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance; (c) increased activity of the gut endocannabinoid system. Fecal transplantation studies in germ-free mice have provided crucial insights into the potential causative role of the gut  in the development of obesity and obesity-related disorders. Diet +/- bariatric surgery have been reported to modulate the gut , leading to lean host phenotype body composition. This review aims to report clinical evidence for a link of the gut  with human obesity and obesity-related diseases, to provide molecular insights into these associations, and to address the effect of diet and bariatric surgery on the gut , including colonic , as a potential mechanism for promoting weight loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583399>Unexpectedly Weak Anti- in 2 Group O Pediatric Patients on Parenteral Nutrition and Disease Specific Supplemental Enteral Feeds.</a></h2><p>Anti-A and anti- antibodies are naturally occurring and develop from exposure to intestinal bacteria after age 4 to 6 months.

From the 411 studies retrieved, 22 studies were included for this review.Studies reporting data on biomarker changes during and after full mouth EG trial were included. Two studies reported findings on changes in biomarkers of microbiological, 12 on immunological and eight on biochemical origin. Changes were reported in the induction phase, and occasionally in the resolution phase. The microbiological composition of both supragingival and subgingival dental plaque changed over the course of EG to a more pathogenic direction, but showed a shift back to a more normal composition. This indicates resilience of the oral . For immunological biomarkers, it was challenging to retrieve a robust pattern of changes across multiple studies. IL-1β and IL-6 in saliva and in gingival crevicular fluid increased during induction phase and returned in the resolution phase below baseline values. The biochemical parameters cystatin-SN, cystatin-S and lactoferrin in saliva were increased at the end of induction phase, however also here no clear pattern emerged based on all available studies.More research is needed to investigate which microbiological, immunological, and biochemical biomarkers can be useful for future investigations into the resistance and resilience of the oral cavity to experimental gingivitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461095>Lactobacillus acidophilus alleviates type 2 diabetes by regulating hepatic glucose, lipid metabolism and gut  in mice.</a></h2><p>Diabetes, an endocrine and metabolic disorder, has become the third most non-infectious chronic disease that threatens human health. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for more than 90% of diabetic patients, mainly caused by environmental factors. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibit several health benefits to the host including regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and improving oxidative stress and inflammatory response. However, the anti-diabetic mechanism of probiotics has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, the anti-diabetic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 on T2D mice were assessed. Oral administration of L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 for 6 weeks significantly improved the epithelial barrier function, which in turn lowered inflammation cytokines, including IL-8, TNF-α and IL-1β in liver and colon tissue, and prevented liver and colon tissue injuries to some extent. Additionally, L. acidophilus treatment regulated the expression genes that are related to glucose and lipid metabolism. The two tested strains down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c), and up-regulated the expression of protein kinase  (Akt). However, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 is better for improving T2D than L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003. Further research showed that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 supplementation could reshape gut , increasing short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Blautia, Roseburia and Anaerotruncus) and the level of SCFAs and decreasing the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria such as Desulfovibrio, Alistipes and Bacteroides.

Holometabolous insects, as well as other animals that undergo metamorphosis, face unique constraints on symbiont maintenance. Microbes present in larvae encounter a radical transformation of their habitat and may also need to withstand chemical and immunological challenges. Metamorphosis also provides an opportunity, in that symbiotic associations can be decoupled over development. For example, some holometabolous insects maintain the same symbiont as larvae and adults, but house it in different tissues; in other species, larvae and adults may harbour entirely different types or numbers of microbes, in accordance with shifts in host diet or habitat. Such flexibility may provide an advantage over hemimetabolous insects, in which selection on adult-stage microbial associations may be constrained by its negative effects on immature stages, and vice versa. Additionally, metamorphosis itself can be directly influenced by symbionts. Across disparate insect taxa, microbes protect hosts from pathogen infection, supply nutrients essential for rebuilding the adult body and provide cues regulating pupation. However, microbial associations remain completely unstudied for many families and even orders of Holometabola, and future research will undoubtedly reveal more links between metamorphosis and , two widespread features of animal life.

Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (P. anaerobius) is an anaerobic bacterium selectively enriched in the faecal and mucosal  from patients with CRC, but its causative role and molecular mechanism in promoting tumorigenesis remain unestablished. We demonstrate that P. anaerobius adheres to the CRC mucosa and accelerates CRC development in Apc mice. In vitro assays and transmission electron microscopy revealed that P. anaerobius selectively adheres to CRC cell lines (HT-29 and Caco-2) compared to normal colonic epithelial cells (NCM460). We identified a P. anaerobius surface protein, putative cell wall binding repeat 2 (PCWBR2), which directly interacts with colonic cell lines via α/β integrin, a receptor frequently overexpressed in human CRC tumours and cell lines. Interaction between PCWBR2 and integrin α/β induces the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway in CRC cells via phospho-focal adhesion kinase, leading to increased cell proliferation and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ) activation. NF-κ in turn triggers a pro-inflammatory response as indicated by increased levels of cytokines, such as interleukin-10 and interferon-γ in the tumours of P. anaerobius-treated Apc mice. Analyses of tumour-infiltrating immune cell populations in P. anaerobius-treated Apc mice revealed significant expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumour-associated macrophages and granulocytic tumour-associated neutrophils, which are associated with chronic inflammation and tumour progression. Blockade of integrin α/β by RGDS peptide, small interfering RNA or antibodies all impair P. anaerobius attachment and abolish P. anaerobius-mediated oncogenic response in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, we show that P. anaerobius drives CRC via a PCWBR2-integrin α/β-PI3K-Akt-NF-κ signalling axis and identify the PCWBR2-integrin α/β axis as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405010>Screening of the High-Rhizosphere Competent ' Culturable Endophyte  Allows the Recovery of Multifaceted and Versatile Biocontrol Agents.</a></h2><p>Halophyte , an evergreen shrub inhabiting the Mediterranean region, has well-documented phytoremediation potential for metal removal from polluted sites. It is also considered to be a medicinal halophyte with potent activity against plant pathogens. Therefore,  may be a suitable candidate for isolating endophytic  members that provide plant growth promotion (PGP) and resistance to abiotic stresses. Selected for biocontrol abilities, these endophytes may represent multifaceted and versatile biocontrol agents, combining pathogen biocontrol in addition to PGP and plant protection against abiotic stresses. In this study 117 root culturable bacterial endophytes, including Gram-positive ( and ), Gram-negative (, , , , ,  and ) and actinomycete  genera have been recovered from . The collection exhibited high levels of biocontrol abilities against bacterial ( MAT2 and  MAT3) and fungal ( XSZJY-1,  MAT1 and  f. sp. radicis lycopersici FORL) pathogens. Several bacteria also showed PGP capacity and resistance to antibiotics and metals. A highly promising candidate  LMRE 36 with high PGP, biocontrol, metal and antibiotic, resistance was subsequently tested in planta (potato and olive trees) for biocontrol of a collection of 14 highly damaging  species. LMRE 36 proved very effective against the collection in both species and against an emerging  sp. threatening olive trees culture in nurseries. These findings provide a demonstration of our pyramiding strategy. Our strategy was effective in combining desirable traits in biocontrol agents towards broad-spectrum resistance against pathogens and protection of crops from abiotic stresses. Stacking multiple desirable traits into a single biocontrol agent is achieved by first, careful selection of a host for endophytic  recovery; second, stringent in vitro selection of candidates from the collection; and third, application of the selected biocontrol agents in planta experiments. That pyramiding strategy could be successfully used to mitigate effects of diverse biotic and abiotic stresses on plant growth and productivity. It is anticipated that the strategy will provide a new generation of biocontrol agents by targeting the  of plants in hostile environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434568>Current understanding of the gut  shaping mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidences have shown strong associations between gut  and many human diseases, and understanding the dynamic crosstalks of host-microbe interaction in the gut has become necessary for the detection, prevention, or therapy of diseases. Many reports have showed that diet, nutrient, pharmacologic factors and many other stimuli play dominant roles in the modulation of gut microbial compositions. However, it is inappropriate to neglect the impact of host factors on shaping the gut . In this review, we highlighted the current findings of the host factors that could modulate the gut . Particularly the epithelium-associated factors, including the innate immune sensors, anti-microbial peptides, mucus barrier, secretory IgAs, epithelial microvilli, epithelial tight junctions, epithelium metabolism, oxygen barrier, and even the microRNAs are discussed in the context of the  shaping. With these shaping factors, the gut epithelial cells could select the residing microbes and affect the microbial composition.

Here, we show that high fat diet (HFD) feeding alters intestinal IgA immune cells and that IgA is a critical immune regulator of glucose homeostasis. Obese mice have fewer IgA immune cells and less secretory IgA and IgA-promoting immune mediators. HFD-fed IgA-deficient mice have dysfunctional glucose metabolism, a phenotype that can be recapitulated by adoptive transfer of intestinal-associated pan- cells. Mechanistically, IgA is a crucial link that controls intestinal and adipose tissue inflammation, intestinal permeability, microbial encroachment and the composition of the intestinal  during HFD. Current glucose-lowering therapies, including metformin, affect intestinal-related IgA  cell populations in mice, while bariatric surgery regimen alters the level of fecal secretory IgA in humans. These findings identify intestinal IgA immune cells as mucosal mediators of whole-body glucose regulation in diet-induced metabolic disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450824>Identification of a Shared Microbiomic and Metabolomic Profile in Systemic Autoimmune Diseases.</a></h2><p>Dysbiosis has been described in systemic autoimmune diseases (SADs), including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome (SjS), and primary anti-phosholipid syndrome (PAPS), however the biological implications of these associations are often elusive. Stool and plasma samples from 114 subjects, including in SLE ( = 27), SjS ( = 23), PAPs ( = 11) and undifferentiated connective tissue (UCTD,  = 26) patients, and geographically-matched healthy controls (HCs,  = 27), were collected for  (16s rRNA gene sequencing) and metabolome (high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry) analysis to identify shared characteristics across diseases. Out of 130 identified microbial genera, a subset of 29 bacteria was able to differentiate study groups (area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) = 0.730 ± 0.025). A fair classification was obtained with a subset of 41 metabolic peaks out of 254 (AUROC = 0.748 ± 0.021). In both models, HCs were well separated from SADs, while UCTD largely overlapped with the other diseases.

We demonstrate that classification accuracy degrades linearly with the degree to which that assumption is violated, and in practice it is always violated. By incorporating environment-specific taxonomic abundance information, we demonstrate a significant increase in the species-level classification accuracy across common sample types. At the species level, overall average error rates decline from 25% to 14%, which is favourably comparable to the error rates that existing classifiers achieve at the genus level (16%). Our findings indicate that for most practical purposes, the assumption that reference species are equally likely to be observed is untenable. q2-clawback provides a straightforward alternative for samples from common environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554129>Effect of potato fiber on survival of Lactobacillus species at simulated gastric conditions and composition of the gut  in vitro.</a></h2><p>Potato fiber is a side product in starch manufacturing rich in dietary fibers such as pectin, cellulose, hemicellulose and resistant starch. So far, the beneficial properties of potato fiber have been poorly characterized. This study investigated the effect of FiberBind 400, a commercial potato fiber product, on survival of probiotic Lactobacillus strains at simulated gastric conditions and on the composition and metabolic activity of the gut , using the TIM-2 colon model. Resistant starch and native starch from potato were used as reference substrates. FiberBind 400 had an ability to improve survival of the four tested strains, Lactobacillus fermentum PCC®, L. rhamnosus LGG®, L. reuteri RC-14® and L. paracasei F-19® in a strain-dependent way. The highest effect was observed for L. fermentum PCC® and L. rhamnosus LGG®. The effect of starches on bacterial survival was insignificant. Composition of the fecal  in TIM-2 fermentations was assessed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon. Fermentation of FiberBind 400 resulted in more diverse microbial communities compared to starches. Changes in microbial abundances specifically mediated by FiberBind 400, included increases in the genera Lachnospira, Butyrivibrio, Mogibacterium, Parabacteroides, Prevotella and Desulfovibrio, and the species . ovatus, as well as decreases in Ruminococcus torques and unassigned Ruminococcus spp. Shifts in other bacterial populations, such as increased abundances of Oscillospira, Enterococcus, Bacteroidales, Citrobacter, along with reduction of Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were not significantly different between the substrates. Cumulative production of individual short-chain fatty acids was similar between potato fiber and starches. The study demonstrated that FiberBind 400 had a potential to protect probiotic Lactobacillus strains during the passage through the gastrointestinal tract and selectively modulate the gut bacterial populations. This knowledge can support application of potato fiber as a functional food ingredient with added biological benefits.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Given their commitment to antimicrobial mucosal immunity, we investigated mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and Vα7.2+CD161- T-cell frequency/function and their possible associations with MT and gut dysbiosis, in chronic HIV and/or HCV infections. We enrolled 56 virally infected (VI) patients (pts): 13 HIV+ on suppressive cART (HIV-RNA < 40cp/ml), 13 HCV+ naive to DAA (direct-acting antiviral) anti-HCV agents; 30 HCV+/HIV+ on suppressive cART and naive to anti-HCV. 13 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. For Vα7.2+CD161++ and Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ T cells we assessed: activation (CD69), exhaustion (PD1/CD39), and cytolytic activity (granzymeB/perforin). Following PMA/ionomycin and  stimulation we measured intracellular IL17/TNFα/IFNγ. Markers of microbial translocation (Plasma LPS, 16S rDNA, EndoCAb and I-FABP) were quantified. In 5 patients per group we assessed stool  composition by 16S targeted metagenomics sequencing (alpha/beta diversity, relative abundance). Compared to controls, virally infected pts displayed significantly lower circulating Vα7.2+CD161++CD8+ MAIT cells ( = 0.001), yet expressed higher perforin ( = 0.004) and granzyme  ( = 0.002) on CD8+ MAIT cells. Upon  stimulation, the residual MAIT cells are less functional particularly those from HIV+/HCV+ patients. Conversely, in virally infected pts, Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ cells were comparable in frequency, highly activated/exhausted (CD69+:  = 0.002; PD-1+:  = 0.030) and with cytolytic potential (perforin+:  < 0.0001), yet were poorly responsive to  stimulation. A profound gut dysbiosis characterized virally infected pts, especially HCV+/HIV+ co-infected patients, delineating a -poor/rich , with significant associations with MAIT cell frequency/function. Irrespective of mono/dual infection, HIV+ and HCV+ patients display depleted, yet activated/cytolytic MAIT cells with reduced  function, suggesting an impoverished pool, possibly due to continuous bacterial challenge.

Thereby, it modulates immune responses against tumors, microbial and viral infections and autoimmune diseases. Recently, the production of αGalCer by Bacteroidetes from the human gut  was elucidated. Using hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, we screened murine intestinal tracts to identify and quantify αGalCers, and we investigated the αGalCer response to different dietary and physiologic conditions. In both the caecum and the colon of mice, we found 1-15 pmol αGalCer/mg protein; in contrast, mice lacking  (germ-free mice) and fed identical diet did not harbor αGalCer. The identified αGalCer contained a β(R)-hydroxylated hexadecanoyl chain N-linked to C18-sphinganine, which differed from what has been reported with Bacteroides fragilis. (Unlike β-anomeric structures, but similar to αGalCers from . fragilis, the synthetic form of the murine αGalCer induced iNKT cell activation in vitro. Last, we observed a decrease in αGalCer production in mice exposed to conditions that alter the composition of the gut , including Western type diet, colitis, and influenza A virus infection. Collectively, this study suggests that αGalCer is produced by commensals in the mouse intestine and reveals that stressful conditions causing dysbiosis alter its synthesis. The consequences of this altered production on iNKT cell-mediated local and systemic immune responses are worthy of future studies.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574574>Adzuki Bean Water Extract Attenuates Obesity by Modulating M2/M1 Macrophage Polarization and Gut  Composition.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a chronic condition resulting in excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissues. Adipose tissue is now considered as an immune organ, at the crossroads between metabolism and immunity. Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on obesity and gut  in high fat diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces body weight and adipose tissue weight in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing M2-polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit adipogenesis via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression. Moreover, the studies confirm that AWE decreases obesity through modulating gut .The results demonstrate that AWE supplementation ameliorates high fat diet-induced obesity and gut  composition and suggests that AWE may have the potential to be developed into a functional food to improve metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The gut  can influence arsenic toxic effects.We aimed to explore whether gut  play a role in arsenic-induced LXR/RXR signaling inhibition and the subsequent lipid and cholesterol dysbiosis.Conventional and antibiotic-treated mice (AB-treated mice) were exposed to  and  arsenic for 2 wk. Hepatic mRNAs were extracted and sequenced. The expression levels of genes associated with LXR/RXR signaling were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and serum and hepatic cholesterol levels were measured. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based lipidomics were used to examine serum and hepatic lipids.Pathway analysis indicated that arsenic exposure differentially influenced the hepatic signaling pathways in conventional and AB-treated mice. The expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (), and cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (), as well as cholesterol efflux genes, including ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 5/8 () and cluster of differentiation 36 (), was lower in arsenic-exposed conventional mice but not in AB-treated mice. Similarly, under arsenic exposure, the hepatic expression of scavenger receptor class  member 1 (), which is involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), was lower in conventional mice, but was higher in AB-treated animals compared with controls. Correspondingly, arsenic exposure exerted opposite effects on the serum cholesterol levels in conventional and AB-treated mice, i.e., higher serum cholesterol levels in conventional mice but lower levels in AB-treated mice than in respective controls. Serum lipid levels, especially triglyceride (TG) levels, were higher in conventional mice exposed to  arsenic, while arsenic exposure did not significantly affect the serum lipids in AB-treated mice. Liver lipid patterns were also differentially perturbed in a -dependent manner.Our results suggest that in mice, the gut  may be a critical factor regulating arsenic-induced LXR/RXR signaling perturbation, suggesting that modulation of the gut  might be an intervention strategy to reduce the toxic effects of arsenic on lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4415.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443482>The Interplay between Maternal and Post-Weaning High-Fat Diet and Gut  in the Developmental Programming of Hypertension.</a></h2><p>Excessive intake of saturated fat has been linked to hypertension. Gut  and their metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), are known to be involved in the development of hypertension. We examined whether maternal and post-weaning high-fat (HF) diet-induced hypertension in adult male offspring is related to alterations of gut , mediation of SCFAs and their receptors, and downregulation of nutrient-sensing signals. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received either a normal diet (ND) or HF diet (D12331, Research Diets) during pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring were put on either the ND or HF diet from weaning to 16 weeks of age, and designated to four groups (maternal diet/post-weaning diet;  = 8/group): ND/ND, HF/ND, ND/HF, and HF/HF. Rats were sacrificed at 16 weeks of age. Combined HF/HF diets induced elevated blood pressure (BP) and increased body weight and kidney damage in male adult offspring. The rise in BP is related to a downregulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) pathway. Additionally, HF/HF diets decreased fecal concentrations of propionate and butyrate and decreased G protein-coupled receptor 41 (GPR41), but increased olfactory receptor 78 (Oflr78) expression.

Using a high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing technique, we investigated the  harbored in the intestinal content and mucus of the fish offered feeds supplemented with 0.5 and 2.5% AlgOS. We found that the prebiotic shifts the intestinal  profile; alpha diversity was significantly reduced with 2.5% AlgOS while with 0.5% AlgOS the alteration occurred without impacting the bacterial diversity. Beta diversity analysis indicated the significant differences between control and prebiotic-fed groups. The low supplementation level of AlgOS facilitated the dominance of Proteobacteria (including , , ), and Spirochaetes () in the content or mucus of the fish, and few of these bacteria (, ) have genes associated with butyrate production. The results indicate that the low inclusion of AlgOS can plausibly induce a prebiotic effect on the distal intestinal  of Atlantic salmon.

Clinical studies and animal models have shown a shift of gut  from bacteroidetes to firmicutes in NAFLD patients and a diet-induced NAFLD mouse model. Therefore, we hypothesized that these 2 groups of bacteria may have differential effects on lipid metabolism in the liver, which further contributed to pathogenesis of NAFLD. To elucidate these effects, we inoculated two species of Bacteroidetes (-group) or five species of Firmicutes (F-group) which were isolated from healthy individuals into germ-free mice. We found that the F-group induced elevated body weight, liver weight, and hepatic steatosis compared to the -group under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. The mRNA expression level of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) was elevated in the F-group compared to that in the -group. Increased mRNA expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were also seen under HFD conditions in the F-group compared to that in the -group. In addition, the expression level of miR802-5p was only elevated in the F-group under HFD conditions. Taken together, our results suggested that these specific species of Firmicutes may induce more hepatic steatosis by modulating fatty acid influx and lipogenesis compared to those of Bacteroidetes.

The relative abundance of family Pseudomonadaceae, family Enterobacteriaceae and order Pseudomonadales also increased significantly following secukinumab therapy. In contrast, there was no significant change in gut  composition following ustekinumab treatment, and only genus Coprococcus significantly increased after 6 months of ustekinumab therapy.

However, antibiotics lead to a loss of  diversity, which is connected to a higher incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Antimicrobial therapies that eliminate invading bacteria and reduce neutrophil-mediated damage without reducing the diversity of the  are therefore highly desirable. A potential solution would be the use of antimicrobial antibodies that target invading pathogens, ultimately leading to their elimination by innate immune cells. In a mouse model of aGVHD, we investigated the potency of active and passive immunization against the conserved microbial surface polysaccharide poly--acetylglucosamine (PNAG) that is expressed on numerous pathogens. Treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to PNAG (anti-PNAG) or vaccination against PNAG reduced aGVHD-related mortality. Anti-PNAG treatment did not change the intestinal microbial diversity as determined by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Anti-PNAG treatment reduced myeloperoxidase activation and proliferation of neutrophil granulocytes (neutrophils) in the ileum of mice developing GVHD. In vitro, anti-PNAG treatment showed high antimicrobial activity. The functional role of neutrophils was confirmed by using neutrophil-deficient     mice that had no survival advantage under anti-PNAG treatment. In summary, the control of invading bacteria by anti-PNAG treatment could be a novel approach to reduce the uncontrolled neutrophil activation that promotes early GVHD and opens a new avenue to interfere with aGVHD without affecting commensal intestinal microbial diversity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550038>Screening for Asymptomatic Bacteriuria in Adults: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.</a></h2><p>Among the general adult population, women (across all ages) have the highest prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, although rates increase with age among both men and women. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is present in an estimated 1% to 6% of premenopausal women and an estimated 2% to 10% of pregnant women and is associated with pyelonephritis, one of the most common nonobstetric reasons for hospitalization in pregnant women. Among pregnant persons, pyelonephritis is associated with perinatal complications including septicemia, respiratory distress, low birth weight, and spontaneous preterm birth.To update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on potential benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults, including pregnant persons.This recommendation applies to community-dwelling adults 18 years and older and pregnant persons of any age without signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection.Based on a review of the evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons has moderate net benefit in reducing perinatal complications. There is adequate evidence that pyelonephritis in pregnancy is associated with negative maternal outcomes and that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria can reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnant persons.

While the disease can occur at any age, mounting evidence from longitudinal cohort studies of at-risk children indicate that type 1 diabetes associated autoantibodies can be present from the first year of life, and that those who develop type 1 diabetes at a young age have a more aggressive form of the disease. This corroborates the hypothesis that environmental exposures in early life contribute to type 1 diabetes risk, whether related to maternal influences on the fetus during pregnancy, neonatal factors or later effects during infancy and early childhood. Studies to date show a range of environmental triggers acting at different time points, suggesting a multifactorial model of genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, which integrally involves a dialogue between the immune system and pancreatic beta cells. For example, breastfeeding may have a weak protective effect on type 1 diabetes risk, while use of an extensively hydrolysed formula does not. Additionally, exposure to being overweight pre-conception, both in utero and postnatally, is associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes. Epidemiological, clinical and pathological studies in humans support a role for viral infections, particularly enteroviruses, in type 1 diabetes, but definitive proof is lacking. The role of the early  and its perturbations in islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes is the subject of investigation in ongoing cohort studies.

Bacterial diversity in the buttock lesion area and subsequent recovery after emollient treatment have been discussed herein.In buttock skin of children with or without diaper dermatitis, Staphylococcus and Anaerococcus were predominant in the total skin . Compared with the healthy group, the overall skin bacterial richness and diversity were higher in children with diaper dermatitis, with the abundance of Proteobacteria being significantly higher. In the diaper dermatitis group, the richness of Enterococcus, Erwinia and Pseudomonas was significantly higher, and the levels of Clostridium and Actinomyces were significantly lower than those in healthy children. Richness of Staphylococcus aureus was significantly higher in the diaper dermatitis group, whereas that of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bifidobacterium longum was lower.

Studying the relationship between these pathways can help us understand the pathogenesis of human diseases, and lead to new solutions for their treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513705>Emergence of Polymyxin Resistance in Clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae Through Diverse Genetic Adaptations: A Genomic, Retrospective Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>Polymyxins are antimicrobials of last resort for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, but resistance in 5% to >40% isolates has been reported. We conducted a genomic survey of clinical polymyxin-resistant (PR) Klebsiella pneumoniae to determine the molecular mechanisms of PR and the role of polymyxin exposure versus transmission in PR emergence.We included 88 patients with PR K. pneumoniae from 2011-2018 and collected demographic, antimicrobial exposure, and infection data. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 388 isolates, including 164 PR isolates. Variant calling and insertion sequence detection were performed, focusing on key genes associated with PR (mgrB, crrAB, phoPQ, and pmrAB). We conducted phylogenetic analyses of key K. pneumoniae multi-locus sequence types (ST258, ST17, ST307, and ST392).Polymyxin exposure was documented in 53/88 (60%) patients prior to PR detection. Through an analysis of key PR genes, we detected 129 individual variants and 72 unique variant combinations in PR isolates. This included multiple, distinct changes in 36% of patients with serial PR isolates. Insertion sequence disruption was limited to mgrB (P < .001). Polymyxin minimum inhibitory concentrations showed stepwise increases with the number of PR genes affected (P < .001). When clusters containing PR isolates in ≥2 patients were analyzed, 10/14 had multiple genetic events leading to PR.Molecular mechanisms leading to PR in clinical K. pneumoniae isolates are remarkably heterogenous, even within clusters or individual patients. Polymyxin exposure with de novo PR emergence led to PR in the majority of patients, rather than transmission. Optimizing polymyxin use should be a key strategy in stopping the spread of PR.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

In rice, direct defense mechanisms include broad range of secondary metabolites, such as phenolamides (PA), diterpene phytoalexins, and flavonoid sakuranetin. Recently, accumulation of PAs in rice was shown to be under control of microbial symbionts in honeydew (HD), digestive waste from the rice brown planthopper (; BPH), but whether HD  can also promote diterpene phytoalexins, momilactone A (MoA) and MoB, has not been reported. Here, we demonstrate that crude HD, but not a filtered one, induces MoA and MoB in rice, suggesting the involvement of BPH-HD endosymbionts. Consequently, microbial strains previously isolated from HD could promote MoA and MoB levels in wounded rice leaves, suggesting that rice indeed responds to BPH by cumulative chemical defense that involves both PA and diterpene phytoalexin pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550826>[Efficacy analysis of fecal  transplantation in the treatment of 2010 patients with intestinal disorders].</a></h2><p> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fecal  transplantation (FMT) for intestinal disorders.  A retrospectively descriptive cohort study was carried out. Clinical data of 2010 patients who underwent FMT and received follow-up for more than 3 months from May 2014 to November 2018 were collected, including 1,206 cases from Tongji University Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital and 804 cases from Nanjing Eastern Military General Hospital. Of the 2,010 patients, 797 were male and 1,213 were female, with a mean age of (49.4±16.5) years old. Inclusion criteria were those with indications for FMT and voluntary treatment of FMT. Pregnant or lactating women, patients with end-stage disease, cases who were participating or participated in other clinical trials within 3 months, and patients with previous bowel history of pathogen infection, oral antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the recent2 weeks, and those at immunosuppressive state were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from the enrolled patients and their families. There were 1,356 cases of constipation, 175 cases of inflammatory bowel disease, 148 cases of chronic diarrhea, 127 cases of radiation enteritis, 119 cases of irritable bowel syndrome, and 85 cases of autism (complicating with intestinal disorders). FMT donor requirements: (1) 18 to 30 years old non-relatives, non-pregnant healthy adults with healthy lifestyle and good eating habits as volunteers to participate in fecal donation; (2) no administration of antibiotics within 3 months; (3) no chronic diseases such as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, etc., no autoimmune disease, not in immunosuppressive state, no history of malignant disease; (4) negative pathogen examination of infectious diseases (hepatitis  virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV, etc.); (5) negative fecal examination (C.difficile, dysentery bacillus, Shigella, Campylobacter, parasites, etc.). The donor requirements after enrollment: (1) physical examination was reviewed once every two months, and the result still met the above requirements; (2) 16S rRNA sequencing was performed for every fecal donation in order to ensure that the composition and diversity of the fecal flora was stable and reliable. The preparation of the stool suspension referred to the Amsterdam criteria and the preparation process was less than 1 hour. The preparation of the FMT capsule was processed by pre-freezing the stool suspension after the preparation of the above suspension, and the frozen sample was transferred into a freeze dryer for freezing. The dried and lyophilized powder was encapsulated in capsules, and the capsule shell was made of acid-resistant hypromellose capsule (No.0) and pediatric-specific capsule (No.3), sealed and packaged in a-20℃ refrigerator. Three ways of accepting FMT treatment pathways included 6-day transplantation after the placement of the nasointestinal tube, 6-day oral FMT capsule transplantation and one-time transplantation through colonoscopy. Intestinal preparation (nasointestinal tube feeding of polyethylene glycol until watery stool) was carried out before transplantation. Other treatments were stopped during treatment and follow-up, and any medication was not recommended when necessary.  Of the 2010 patients, 1,497 cases received nasointestinal tube transplantation (nasointestinal tube group), 452 cases oral capsule transplantation (oral capsule group) and 61 cases colonoscopy (colonoscopy group). At 3 time points of 3, 12, and 36 months after FMT, the clinical cure rates and the clinical improvement rates were 41.3% (560/1 356), 35.2% (320/909), 31.4% (69/220), and 29.0% (393/1 356), 27.8% (253/909), 29.1% (64/220), respectively in constipation patients; 33.1% (58/175), 29.9% (35/117), 24.5% (12/49), and 31.4% (55/175), 27.4% (32/117), 57.1% (28/49), respectively in inflammatory bowel disease patients; 87.8% (130/148), 81.8% (81/99), 78.3% (36/46), and 8.1% (12/148), 7.1% (7/99), 4.3% (2/46), respectively in chronic diarrhea patients; 61.4% (78/127), 56.5% (48/85), 47.6% (20/42), and 21.2% (27/127), 15.3% (13/85), 14.3% (6/42), respectively in radiation enteritis patients; 53.8% (64/119), 45.0% (36/80), 6/15, and 21.0% (25/119), 26.2% (21/80), 4/15, respectively in irritable bowel syndrome patients; 23.5% (20/85), 22.8% (13/57), 20.0%(5/25), and 55.3% (47/85), 49.1% (28/57), 40.0% (10/25), respectively in autism patients. Meanwhile the clinical cure rates and the clinical improvement rates at 3, 12, and 36 months were 47.7% (714/1 497), 42.8% (425/994), 39.1% (128/327), and 29.1% (436/1 497), 27.0% (268/994), 28.1% (92/327), respectively in the nasointestinal tube group; 38.7% (175/452), 30.2% (91/301), 33.3% (16/48), and 24.3% (110/452), 26.2% (79/301), 25.0% (12/48), respectively in the oral capsule group; 34.4% (21/61), 32.7% (17/52), 18.2% (4/22), and 21.3% (13/61), 13.5% (7/52), 45.5% (10/22), respectively in colonoscopy group. No serious adverse events occurred during treatment and follow-up period. The adverse event of nasointestinal tube group presented higher ratio of discomfort in respiratorytract accounting for 13.1% (196/1497); the oral capsule group had a higher proportion of nausea and vomiting when swallowing capsules accounting for 7.1% (32/452); the colonoscopy group was mainly diarrhea, accounting for 37.7% (23/61). The above symptoms disappeared after the nasointestinal tube was removed, or after treatment ended, or within 1 to 3 days after hospitalization.

The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes by a FACSCount automated instrument. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Correlations among intestinal flora, inflammatory factor levels, and CD4+ T lymphocyte values were evaluated using the Spearman correlation coefficient.The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the AIDS group were higher than those in the control group, while the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes was lower. The amounts of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the AIDS group were significantly lower than those in control group, while the amounts of E. coli, E. faecalis, and E. faecium were much higher. The amounts of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus were negatively correlated with the content of TNF-α and IL-6 and the CD4+ T lymphocyte count, while those correlations were reversed for E. coli, E. faecalis, and E. faecium.The intestinal  of AIDS/HIV patients were disordered, and there was a correlation between the amount of intestinal flora and the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes and the levels of TNF-α and IL-6.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521198>Commensal-derived metabolites govern Vibrio cholerae pathogenesis in host intestine.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence suggests that the commensal microbes act as a barrier against invading pathogens and enteric infections are the consequences of multi-layered interactions among commensals, pathogens, and the host intestinal tissue. However, it remains unclear how perturbations of the gut  compromise host infection resistance, especially through changes at species and metabolite levels.Here, we illustrate how Bacteroides vulgatus, a dominant species of the Bacteroidetes phylum in mouse intestine, suppresses infection by Vibrio cholerae, an important human pathogen. Clindamycin (CL) is an antibiotic that selectively kills anaerobic bacteria, and accordingly Bacteroidetes are completely eradicated from CL-treated mouse intestines. The Bacteroidetes-depleted adult mice developed severe cholera-like symptoms, when infected with V. cholerae. Germ-free mice mono-associated with . vulgatus became resistant to V. cholerae infection. Levels of V. cholerae growth-inhibitory metabolites including short-chain fatty acids plummeted upon CL treatment, while levels of compounds that enhance V. cholerae proliferation were elevated. Furthermore, the intestinal colonization process of V. cholerae was well-simulated in CL-treated adult mice.Overall, we provide insights into how a symbiotic microbe and a pathogenic intruder interact inside host intestine. We identified . vulgatus as an indigenous microbial species that can suppress intestinal infection. Our results also demonstrate that commensal-derived metabolites are a critical determinant for host resistance against V. cholerae infection, and that CL pretreatment of adult mice generates a simple yet useful model of cholera infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462512> cell superantigens in the human intestinal .</a></h2><p>IgA is prominently secreted at mucosal surfaces and coats a fraction of the commensal , a process that is critical for intestinal homeostasis. However, the mechanisms of IgA induction and the molecular targets of these antibodies remain poorly understood, particularly in humans. Here, we demonstrate that  from a subset of human individuals encode two protein "superantigens" expressed on the surface of commensal bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae such as  that bind IgA variable regions and stimulate potent IgA responses in mice. These superantigens stimulate  cells expressing human VH3 or murine VH5/6/7 variable regions and subsequently bind their antibodies, allowing these microbial organisms to become highly coated with IgA in vivo. These findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for commensal superantigens in host- interactions. Furthermore, as superantigen-expressing strains show an uneven distribution across human populations, they should be systematically considered in studies evaluating human  cell responses and  during homeostasis and disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Frequent recurrences have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high healthcare costs, and lower quality of life. In this review, we compare the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent rCDI. We performed a systematic review of the English literature, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated rCDI as an outcome. Studies were included irrespective of patient demographics, disease severity, type of intervention, comparator used, or time-point of outcome evaluation. We performed a comprehensive literature search with the assistance of a research librarian. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Our search yielded 38 RCTs (8,102 participants). Nineteen RCTs (3,743 subjects) evaluated antibiotics, eight fecal  transplantation (FMT) (582 subjects), three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (2,805 subjects), and eight probiotics, prebiotics, or non-antibiotic polymers (972 subjects). The antibiotic and FMT therapies that demonstrated efficacy in rCDI prevention included: fidaxomicin (when compared to a ten-day vancomycin course) and FMT administered by nasogastric tube (when compared to a fourteen-day vancomycin course and a fourteen-day vancomycin course plus bowel lavage). Actoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin A; CDA1) plus bezlotoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin ; CDB1) in combination or bezlotoxumab alone appeared to be more effective in preventing rCDI compared to actoxumab alone. Of the prebiotics, probiotics, and nonantibiotic polymers, oligofructose, Saccharomyces boulardii, and the nontoxigenic C. difficile strain M3 were the most efficacious for rCDI prevention. Thirty-eight RCTs (>8,000 participants) evaluating treatment modalities for CDI were examined for efficacy in prevention of rCDI. Several CDI-specific antibiotics, FMT modalities, monoclonal antibodies, and various prebiotics and probiotics demonstrated a reduction in risk of rCDI with the greatest risk reduction observed with FMT and monoclonal antibody therapy. It is notable that the comparators in these studies were very different from one another and the relative risk reduction of rCDI may not be directly comparable from one study to the next.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, no method has been developed to control disease-associated commensal microbes. We investigated whether immunization with microbial antigens, using CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and/or curdlan as adjuvants, induces systemic antigen-specific IgA and IgG production and affects development of diseases in mice.C57BL/6 mice were given intramuscular injections of antigens (ovalbumin, cholera toxin -subunit, or pneumococcal surface protein A) combined with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and/or curdlan. Blood and fecal samples were collected weekly and antigen-specific IgG and IgA titers were measured. Lymph nodes and spleens were collected and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antigen-specific splenic T-helper 1 cells, T-helper 17 cells, and memory  cells. Six weeks after primary immunization, mice were given a oral, nasal, or vaginal boost of ovalbumin; intestinal lamina propria, bronchial lavage, and vaginal swab samples were collected and antibodies and cytokines were measured. Some mice were also given oral cholera toxin or intranasal Streptococcus pneumoniae and the severity of diarrhea or pneumonia was analyzed. Gnotobiotic mice were gavaged with fecal material from obese individuals, which had a high abundance of Clostridium ramosum (a commensal microbe associated with obesity and diabetes), and were placed on a high-fat diet 2 weeks after immunization with C ramosum. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.Serum and fecal samples from mice given injections of antigens in combination with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and curdlan for 3 weeks contained antigen-specific IgA and IgG, and splenocytes produced interferon-gamma and interleukin 17A. Lamina propria, bronchial, and vaginal samples contained antigen-specific IgA after the ovalbumin boost. This immunization regimen prevented development of diarrhea after injection of cholera toxin, and inhibited lung colonization by S pneumoniae. In gnotobiotic mice colonized with C ramosum and placed on a high-fat diet, the mice that had been immunized with C ramosum became less obese than the nonimmunized mice.Injection of mice with microbial antigens and adjuvant induces antigen-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses. Immunization with S pneumoniae antigen prevented lung infection by this bacteria, and immunization with C ramosum reduced obesity in mice colonized with this microbe and placed on a high-fat diet. This immunization approach might be used to protect against microbe-associated disorders of intestine.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Host-microbe interactions are highly relevant in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), i.e., a replacement of the cellular components of the patients' immune system with that of a foreign donor. HSCT is employed as curative immunotherapy for a number of non-malignant and malignant hematologic conditions, including cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The procedure can be accompanied by severe side effects such as infections, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), and death. Here, we performed a longitudinal analysis of immunological markers, immune reconstitution and gut  composition in relation to clinical outcomes in children undergoing HSCT. Such an analysis could reveal biomarkers, e.g., at the time point prior to HSCT, that in the future could be used to predict which patients are of high risk in relation to side effects and clinical outcomes and guide treatment strategies accordingly.In two multivariate analyses (sparse partial least squares regression and canonical correspondence analysis), we identified three consistent clusters: (1) high concentrations of the antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) prior to the transplantation in patients with high abundances of Lactobacillaceae, who later developed moderate or severe aGvHD and exhibited high mortality. (2) Rapid reconstitution of NK and  cells in patients with high abundances of obligate anaerobes such as Ruminococcaceae, who developed no or mild aGvHD and exhibited low mortality. (3) High inflammation, indicated by high levels of C-reactive protein, in patients with high abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, we observed that antibiotic treatment influenced the bacterial community state.We identify multivariate associations between specific microbial taxa, host immune markers, immune cell reconstitution, and clinical outcomes in relation to HSCT. Our findings encourage further investigations into establishing longitudinal surveillance of the intestinal  and relevant immune markers, such as hBD2, in HSCT patients. Profiling of the  may prove useful as a prognostic tool that could help identify patients at risk of poor immune reconstitution and adverse outcomes, such as aGvHD and death, upon HSCT, providing actionable information in guiding precision medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523007>Microbial Metabolism Modulates Antibiotic Susceptibility within the Murine Gut .</a></h2><p>Although antibiotics disturb the structure of the gut , factors that modulate these perturbations are poorly understood.

Freshwater environment can thus become reservoirs where an antibiotic impact microorganisms, and is an important public health concern. Degradation and dilution processes are fundamental for predicting the actual risk of antibiotic resistance dissemination from freshwater reservoirs. This study reviews major approaches for detecting and quantifying antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARBs) and genes (ARGs) in freshwater and their prevalence in these environments. Finally, the role of dilution, degradation, transmission and the persistence and fate of ARB/ARG in these environments are also reviewed. Culture-based single strain approaches and molecular techniques that include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and metagenomics are techniques for quantifying ARB and ARGs in freshwater environments. The level of ARBs is extremely high in most of the river systems (up to 98% of the total detected bacteria), followed by lakes (up to 77% of the total detected bacteria), compared to dam, pond, and spring (<1%). Of most concern is the occurrence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which cause highly epidemic infections. Dilution and natural degradation do not completely eradicate ARBs and ARGs in the freshwater environment. Even if the ARBs in freshwater are effectively inactivated by sunlight, their ARG-containing DNA can still be intact and capable of transferring resistance to non-resistant strains. Antibiotic resistance persists and is preserved in freshwater bodies polluted with high concentrations of antibiotics. Direct transmission of indigenous freshwater ARBs to humans as well as their transitory insertion in the  can occur.

Here, we review how and why this developmental strategy has evolved. While there are many theories explaining the evolution of metamorphosis, many of which fit under the hypothesis of decoupling of life stages, there are few clear adaptive hypotheses on why complete metamorphosis evolved. We propose that the main adaptive benefit of complete metamorphosis is decoupling between growth and differentiation. This facilitates the exploitation of ephemeral resources and enhances the probability of the metamorphic transition escaping developmental size thresholds. The evolution of complete metamorphosis comes at the cost of exposure to predators, parasites and pathogens during pupal life and requires specific adaptations of the immune system at this time. Moreover, metamorphosis poses a challenge for the maintenance of symbionts and the gut , although it may also offer the benefit of allowing an extensive change in  between the larval and adult stages. The regulation of metamorphosis by two main players, ecdysone and juvenile hormone, and the related signalling cascades are now relatively well understood. The mechanics of metamorphosis have recently been studied in detail because of the advent of micro-CT and research into the role of cell death in remodelling tissues and organs. We support the argument that the adult stage must necessarily have preceded the larval form of the insect. We do not resolve the still contentious question of whether the larva of insects in general originated through the modification of existing preadult forms or through heterochrony as a modified embryonic stage (pronymph), nor whether the holometabolous pupa arose as a modified hemimetabolous final stage larva.

BKPro-Cyan produced statistically significant improvements compared to placebo for multiple secondary endpoints, including: greater number of subjects who experienced no UTIs (90 vs 67%; P < 0.05); longer time to first UTI (174 vs 90 days; P = 0.001); shorter duration of active UTI (5 vs 12 days; P = 0.009); Fewer subjects requiring antibiotics (3 vs 11; P < 0.05); and shorter median duration of antibiotic treatment (4 vs 7 days; P = 0.09).: BKPro-Cyan was safe and effective for preventing recurrent UTI in pre-menopausal adult women. These findings support the need for further well-designed trials to clarify the benefits that may be achieved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608562>The Janus Face of Cereals: Wheat-Derived Prebiotics Counteract the Detrimental Effect of Gluten on Metabolic Homeostasis in Mice Fed a High Fat/High Sucrose Diet.</a></h2><p>Cereals are important sources of carbohydrates, but also contain nutrients that could impact adiposity. We analyzed the contribution of gluten on obesity and the effects of prebiotics -arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)- that can be extracted from gluten-containing cereals.Mice were fed a control diet, Western diet (WD, consisting of high fat/high sucrose), or WD with 5% gluten. Prebiotics were tested in the WD with gluten. Gluten did not increase body weight or intestinal permeability and had a minor effect on ileal inflammation. Gluten decreased the expression of browning markers in the fat, and increased the triglycerides synthesis in the muscle. AXOS decreased body weight and adiposity in fat pads muscle and liver compared to the WD plus gluten. AXOS promoted gluten cleavage by the induction of prolyl endopeptidase that was translated into a reduction of gluten immunogenic peptides. Gluten had minor effects on cecal  composition, whereas prebiotics increased Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Prevotella and Parasutterella, all negatively correlated to the cecal content of gluten peptides.While gluten may affect metabolic homeostasis, these effects are lessened when gluten is consumed along with cereal-derived fibers. If confirmed in humans, we bring new arguments to eat fiber-rich cereals to promote a healthy diet. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.This article is protected by copyright.

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut  is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa  (NFκ) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκ p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκ p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκ p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest a close relationship between IBD and depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480433>Bone Diseases in Patients with Chronic Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Osteoporosis is a frequently observed complication in patients with chronic liver disease, particularly liver cirrhosis and cholestatic liver diseases. In addition, osteoporosis is critical in patients receiving a liver transplant. Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated bone diseases in patients with more frequently observed chronic liver disease, such as chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Osteoporosis is a disease caused by an imbalance in the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Over the last few decades, many advances have improved our knowledge of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Importantly, activated immune cells affect the progression of osteoporosis, and chronic inflammation may exert an additional effect on the existing pathophysiology of osteoporosis. The  of the intestinal tract may also affect the progression of bone loss in patients with chronic liver disease. Recently, studies regarding the effects of chronic inflammation on dysbiosis in bone diseases have been conducted. However, mechanisms underlying osteoporosis in patients with chronic liver disease are complex and precise mechanisms remain unknown. The following special considerations in patients with chronic liver disease are reviewed: bone diseases in patients who underwent a liver transplant, the association between chronic hepatitis  virus infection treatment and bone diseases, the association between sarcopenia and bone diseases in patients with chronic liver disease, and the association between chronic liver disease and avascular necrosis of the hip. Few guidelines are currently available for the management of low bone mineral density or bone diseases in patients with chronic liver disease. Due to increased life expectancy and therapeutic advances in chronic liver disease, the importance of managing osteoporosis and other bone diseases in patients with chronic liver disease is expected to increase. Consequently, specific guidelines need to be established in the near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475121>Sex-Specific Linkages Between Taxonomic and Functional Profiles of Tick Gut Microbiomes.</a></h2><p>Ticks transmit the most diverse array of disease agents and harbor one of the most diverse microbial communities. Major progress has been made in the characterization of the taxonomic profiles of tick . However, the functional profiles of tick  have been comparatively less studied. In this proof of concept we used state-of-the-art functional metagenomics analytical tools to explore previously reported datasets of bacteria found in male and female , and . Results showed that both taxonomic and functional profiles have differences between sexes of the same species. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that male and female of the same species had major differences in the abundance of genes involved in different metabolic pathways including vitamin , amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides, and antibiotics among others. Partial reconstruction of metabolic pathways using KEGG enzymes suggests that tick  form a complex metabolic network that may increase microbial community resilience and adaptability. Linkage analysis between taxonomic and functional profiles showed that among the KEGG enzymes with differential abundance in male and female ticks only 12% were present in single bacterial genera. The rest of these enzymes were found in more than two bacterial genera, and 27% of them were found in five up to ten bacterial genera. Comparison of bacterial genera contributing to the differences in the taxonomic and functional profiles of males and females revealed that while a small group of bacteria has a dual-role, most of the bacteria contribute only to functional or taxonomic differentiation between sexes. Results suggest that the different life styles of male and female ticks exert sex-specific evolutionary pressures that act independently on the phenomes (set of phenotypes) and genomes of bacteria in tick gut . We conclude that functional redundancy is a fundamental property of male and female tick  and propose that functional metagenomics should be combined with taxonomic profiling of  because both analyses are complementary.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496244>Identification of Novel Urolithin Metabolites in Human Feces and Urine after the Intake of a Pomegranate Extract.</a></h2><p>Urolithins are bioactive gut  metabolites of ellagic acid. Here, we have identified four unknown urolithins in human feces after the intake of a pomegranate extract. The new metabolites occurred only in 19% of the subjects. 4,8,9,10-Tetrahydroxy urolithin, (urolithin M6R), was unambiguously identified by H NMR, UV, and HRMS. Three metabolites were tentatively identified by the UV, HRMS, and chromatographic behavior, as 4,8,10-trihydroxy (urolithin M7R), 4,8,9-trihydroxy (urolithin CR), and 4,8-dihydroxy (urolithin AR) urolithins. Phase II conjugates of the novel urolithins were detected in urine and confirmed their absorption, circulation, and urinary excretion. The production of the new urolithins was not specific of any of the known urolithin metabotypes A and . The new metabolites needed a bacterial 3-dehydroxylase activity for their production, and this is a novel feature as all the previously known urolithins maintained the hydroxyl at 3 position. The ability of production of these "R" urolithins can be considered an additional metabolic feature for volunteer stratification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586453>Effects of Low-FODMAP Diet on Symptoms, Fecal , and Markers of Inflammation in Patients With Quiescent Inflammatory Bowel Disease in a Randomized Trial.</a></h2><p>There is limited evidence that a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) reduces gut symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We performed a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of a low-FODMAP diet on persistent gut symptoms, the intestinal , and circulating markers of inflammation in patients with quiescent IBD.We performed a single-blind trial of 52 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and persistent gut symptoms at 2 large gastroenterology clinics in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that followed a diet low in FODMAPs (n=27) or a control diet (n=25), with dietary advice, for 4 weeks. Gut symptoms and health-related quality of life were measured using validated questionnaires. Stool and blood samples were collected at baseline and end of trial. We assessed fecal  composition and function using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and phenotypes of T cells in blood using flow cytometry.A higher proportion of patients reported adequate relief of gut symptoms following the low-FODMAP diet (14/27, 52%) than the control diet (4/25, 16%, P=.007). Patients had a greater reduction in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores following the low-FODMAP diet (mean reduction of 67; standard error, 78) than the control diet (mean reduction of 34; standard error, 50), although this difference was not statistically significant (P=.075). Following the low-FODMAP diet, patients had higher health-related quality of life scores (81.9±1.2) than patients on the control diet (78.3±1.2, P=.042). A targeted analysis revealed that in stool samples collected at the end of the study period, patients on the low-FODMAP diet had significantly lower abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis,  longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii than patients on control diet. However,  diversity and markers of inflammation did not differ significantly between groups.In a trial of the low-FODMAP diet vs a control diet in patients with quiescent IBD, we found no significant difference after 4 weeks in change in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores, but significant improvements in specific symptom scores and numbers reporting adequate symptom relief. The low-FODMAP diet reduced fecal abundance of microbes believed to regulate the immune response, compared with the control diet, but had no significant effect on markers of inflammation. We conclude that a 4-week diet low in FODMAPs is safe and effective for managing persistent gut symptoms in patients with quiescent IBD. www.isrctn.com no: ISRCTN17061468.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

A common strategy among enteric viruses, including rotaviruses and enteroviruses, is to encode a viral ion channel (i.e., viroporin) that is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and disrupts host calcium (Ca) homeostasis. Previous reports have demonstrated genetic and functional similarities between the nonstructural proteins of caliciviruses and enteroviruses, including the calicivirus NS1-2 protein and the 2B viroporin of enteroviruses. However, it is unknown whether caliciviruses alter Ca homeostasis for virus replication or whether the NS1-2 protein has viroporin activity like its enterovirus counterpart. To address these questions, we used Tulane virus (TV), a rhesus enteric calicivirus, to examine Ca signaling during infection and determine whether NS1-2 has viroporin activity that disrupts Ca homeostasis. We found that TV increases Ca signaling during infection and that increased cytoplasmic Ca levels are important for efficient replication. Further, TV NS1-2 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, the predominant intracellular Ca store, and the NS2 region has characteristics of a viroporin domain (VPD). NS1-2 had viroporin activity in a classic bacterial functional assay and caused aberrant Ca signaling when expressed in mammalian cells, but truncation of the VPD abrogated these activities. Together, our data provide new mechanistic insights into the function of the NS2 region of NS1-2 and support the premise that enteric viruses, including those within , exploit host Ca signaling to facilitate their replication. Tulane virus is one of many enteric caliciviruses that cause acute gastroenteritis and diarrheal disease. Globally, enteric caliciviruses affect both humans and animals and amass >65 billion dollars per year in treatment and health care-associated costs, thus imposing an enormous economic burden. Recent progress has resulted in several cultivation systems ( cells, enteroids, and zebrafish larvae) to study human noroviruses, but mechanistic insights into the viral factors and host pathways important for enteric calicivirus replication and infection are still largely lacking. Here, we used Tulane virus, a calicivirus that is biologically similar to human noroviruses and can be cultivated by conventional cell culture, to identify and functionally validate NS1-2 as an enteric calicivirus viroporin. Viroporin-mediated calcium signaling may be a broadly utilized pathway for enteric virus replication, and its existence within caliciviruses provides a novel approach to developing antivirals and comprehensive therapeutics for enteric calicivirus diarrheal disease outbreaks.Copyright © 2019 Strtak et al.</p></html>
