Plasma ammonia concentrations increased to 411 microm within 1 h of the start of infusion of ammonium acetate at 567 mmol/h. The rate constant for ammonia clearance from plasma was 0 x 054/min and the half-life was 12 x 9 min. Infusion at 567 mmol/h for 1 h followed by 1 h without infusion, repeated four times between am- and pm-milking, caused a decrease in feed intake. Compared with sodium acetate, continuous infusion of ammonium acetate at 360 mmol/h throughout an entire 10-h milking interval increased plasma ammonia concentrations to 193 microm and caused a 20% decrease in milk, protein and lactose production with no effect on percentage composition of milk or the yield of milk . Arterial concentrations of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids tended to increase; there was no effect on arterial acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate or triacylglcerol, and branched-chain amino acids, Lys and Thr decreased. Mammary plasma flow, estimated by assuming 100% uptake/output of Phe+, was significantly correlated with milk yield. Mammary uptakes of acetate tended to be reduced by hyperammonaemia, but uptakes of other energy metabolites and amino acids were not affected. Thus, while an increase in amino acid consumption during hyperammonaemia was apparent from the drop in circulating concentrations of Leu, , Val, Lys and Thr, there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that milk yield is affected by the lower concentrations. An ammonia-induced depression in feed intake may have caused the decrease in milk synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2678101>A 13-amino acid peptide in three yeast glycosyltransferases may be involved in dolichol recognition.</a></h2><p>A 13-amino acid peptide was identified in three glycosyltransferases of the yeast endoplasmic reticulum. These enzymes, the products of the ALG1, ALG7, and DPM1 genes, catalyze the transfer of sugars from nucleotide sugars to dolichol phosphate derivatives. The consensus sequence for the conserved peptide was Leu-Phe-Val-Xaa-Phe-Xaa-Xaa--Pro-Phe-Xaa-Phe-. A sequence resembling the conserved peptide was also found in the predicted SEC59 protein, which is suspected to participate in assembly of the -linked precursor oligosaccharide, although its specific function is unknown. All of the identified sequences contain an isoleucine at position 8 and phenylalanine or tyrosine at positions 2, 5, and 12. We believe this peptide may be involved in dolichol recognition for the following reasons. (i) The conserved sequence occurs in potential membrane-spanning regions. (ii) The ALG7 and DPM1 proteins are known to recognize the isoprenoid region of dolichol phosphate specifically; this recognition presumably occurs in the membrane since dolichol is very hydrophobic. (iii) The consensus sequence is similar to a region of two halobacterial proteins implicated in binding of the isoprenoid region of retinal. (iv) If the consensus sequence is represented as an alpha-helix, the conserved residues lie on one face of the helix. An alpha-helical structure is likely since the conserved regions are in potential membrane-spanning domains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005070>Fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs exhibit differences in nutrient composition according to body weight and gestational period.</a></h2><p>Low birth weight may negatively affect energy storage and nutrient , and impair fetal growth and development. We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude , amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight,  percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude , Gly, Pro, , C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, , Leu, Lys, Phe, Ser, Thr, essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude , C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower  concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude  and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29654463>Valorisation of tuna processing waste biomass: isolation, purification and characterisation of four novel antioxidant peptides from tuna by-product hydrolysate.</a></h2><p>Tuna protein hydrolysate (TPH) was prepared by hydrolysis with Prolyve BS and fractionated by membranes process. The antioxidant activities of recovered peptide fractions were evaluated. Four novel antioxidant peptides that were isolated from nanofiltration retentate exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, using gel chromatography and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequences of isolated peptides were identified as -Glu-Asn-Gly-Gly (P2), Glu-Gly--Pro-Trp-Asn (P4), --Val--Pro-Gly (P7) and Trp-Gly-Asp-Ala-Gly-Gly-- (P8) with molecular weights of 538.46, 764.75, 710.78 and 887.85 Da, respectively. P2, P4, P7 and P8 exhibited good scavenging activities on hydroxyl radical (IC 0.41, 0.327, 0.17 and 0.042 mg/ml), DPPH radical (IC 0.666, 0.326, 0.451 and 0.377 mg/ml) and superoxide radical (IC 0.536, 0.307, 0.357 and 0.115 mg/ml). P7 was effective against  peroxidation in the model system. The isolated peptides might be useful used as natural food additive in food industry and formulation of nutritional products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21974986>Design and development of a peptide-based adiponectin receptor agonist for cancer treatment.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin, a  tissue-derived adipokine, exhibits beneficial effects against insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory conditions, and cancer. Circulating adiponectin levels are decreased in obese individuals, and this feature correlates with increased risk of developing several metabolic, immunological and neoplastic diseases. Thus, pharmacological replacement of adiponectin might prove clinically beneficial, especially for the obese patient population. At present, adiponectin-based therapeutics are not available, partly due to yet unclear structure/function relationships of the cytokine and difficulties in converting the full size adiponectin protein into a viable drug.We aimed to generate adiponectin-based short peptide that can mimic adiponectin action and be suitable for preclinical and clinical development as a cancer therapeutic. Using a panel of 66 overlapping 10 amino acid-long peptides covering the entire adiponectin globular domain (residues 105-254), we identified the 149-166 region as the adiponectin active site. Three-dimensional modeling of the active site and functional screening of additional 330 peptide analogs covering this region resulted in the development of a lead peptidomimetic, ADP 355 (H-DAsn--Pro-Nva-Leu--DSer-Phe-Ala-DSer-NH2). In several adiponectin receptor-positive cancer cell lines, ADP 355 restricted proliferation in a dose-dependent manner at 100 nM-10 μM concentrations (exceeding the effects of 50 ng/mL globular adiponectin). Furthermore, ADP 355 modulated several key signaling pathways (AMPK, Akt, STAT3, ERK1/2) in an adiponectin-like manner. siRNA knockdown experiments suggested that ADP 355 effects can be transmitted through both adiponectin receptors, with a greater contribution of AdipoR1. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of 1 mg/kg/day ADP 355 for 28 days suppressed the growth of orthotopic human breast cancer xenografts by ~31%. The peptide displayed excellent stability (at least 30 min) in mouse blood or serum and did not induce gross toxic effects at 5-50 mg/kg bolus doses in normal CBA/J mice.ADP 355 is a first-in-class adiponectin receptor agonist. Its biological activity, superior stability in biological fluids as well as acceptable toxicity profile indicate that the peptidomimetic represents a true lead compound for pharmaceutical development to replace low adiponectin levels in cancer and other malignancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29352967>Product specificity of fungal 8R- and 9S-dioxygenases of the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily with amino acid derivatized polyenoic fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Pathogenic fungi express fatty acid dioxygenases (DOX) fused to cytochromes P450 with diol or allene oxide synthase activities. The orientation of the fatty acids in the active sites of DOX was investigated with amino acid conjugates of 18:3n-3 and 18:2n-6. 9S-DOX-allene oxide synthase (AOS) oxidized the Gly, , and Trp derivatives at C-9, which suggests that these conjugates enter the substrate recognition site with the omega end in analogy with fatty acids bound to cyclooxygenases and coral 8R-lipoxygenase (8R-LOX). In contrast, 7,8-diol synthases (7,8-LDS), 5,8-LDS, and 8R-DOX-AOS oxidized the Gly conjugates in most case only to small amounts of metabolites, but with retention of hydrogen abstraction at C-8 and relatively minor hydrogen abstraction at C-11. The  and Trp conjugates were not oxidized at C-8, and often insignificantly at C-9/C-13. The 8-DOX domains of these enzymes likely position the carboxyl group of substrates at the end of the active site in analogy with plant α-DOX and 9-LOX.  radicals of the 9S-DOX and 8R-DOX domains catalyze antarafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion in 18:3n-3. This occurs by abstraction of the proR and proS hydrogens at C-11 and C-8, respectively, in agreement with different "head to tail" orientation in the active site.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

PPH was fractionated using ammonium sulfate precipitation; the efficacy of different fractions for scavenging 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(+•)) radicals and inhibiting  oxidation (hexanal, TBARS) in soybean oil-in-water emulsions was investigated. Of all fractions, the fraction precipitated by 50% saturated ammonium sulfate (P50) exhibited the strongest ABTS(+•) scavenging activity and antioxidant activity. Active peptides based on the ABTS(+•) scavenging assay were isolated and purified by RP-HPLC and ultra performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry identified Ser-Ser-Glu-Phe-Thr- and --Leu-Gly-Gln in P50 to be the dominant peptides that matched the sequences in metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor and lipoxygenase 1, respectively.© 2010 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23470256>Identification of amino acids in human colipase that mediate adsorption to lipid emulsions and mixed micelles.</a></h2><p>The adsorption of colipase is essential for pancreatic triglyceride lipase activity and efficient dietary fat digestion. Yet, little is known about which specific amino acids in the hydrophobic surface of colipase influence adsorption. In this study, we systematically substituted alanine or tryptophan at residues implicated in adsorption of colipase to an interface. We expressed, purified recombinant colipase mutants and characterized the ability of each alanine mutant to restore activity to lipase in the presence of bile salts. The functions of L16A, Y55A, I79A and F84A colipase were most impaired with activities ranging from 20 to 60% of wild-type colipase. We next characterized the fluorescence properties of the tryptophan mutants in the absence and presence of bile-salt-oleic acid mixed micelles. We performed steady-state emission spectra to determine peak shift and I330/I350 ratio and acrylamide quenching curves to characterize the environment of the residues. The analysis supports a model of adsorption that includes residues Leu 34 and Leu 36 on the 2nd loop,  55 and  59 on the 3rd loop and  75 and  79 on the 4th loop. The analysis confirms that Phe 84 is not part of the adsorption surface and likely stabilizes the conformation of colipase. Contrary to the predictions of computer modeling, the results provide strong support for an essential role of  55 in colipase adsorption to mixed micelles. The results indicate that the adsorption of colipase to mixed micelles is mediated by specific residues residing in a defined surface of colipase.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While cholesterol-sensing motifs in transmembrane proteins have been identified, little is known about cholesterol recognition by soluble proteins. We reviewed the structural characteristics of binding sites for cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate from crystallographic structures available in the Protein Data Bank. This analysis unveiled key features of cholesterol-binding sites that are present in either all or the majority of sites: ) the cholesterol molecule is generally positioned between protein domains that have an organized secondary structure; ) the cholesterol hydroxyl/sulfo group is often partnered by Asn, Gln, and/or , while the hydrophobic part of cholesterol interacts with Leu, , Val, and/or Phe; ) cholesterol hydrogen-bonding partners are often found on α-helices, while amino acids that interact with cholesterol's hydrophobic core have a slight preference for β-strands and secondary structure-lacking protein areas; ) the steroid's C21 and C26 constitute the "hot spots" most often seen for steroid-protein hydrophobic interactions; ) common "cold spots" are C8-C10, C13, and C17, at which contacts with the proteins were not detected.

The giant water bug Lethocerus indicus (family: Belostomatidae) contains a peptide code-named Letin-AKH with the sequence pGlu-Val-Asn-Phe-Ser-Pro--Trp amide, and the water scorpion Nepa cinerea (family: Nepidae) has the peptide code-named Nepci-AKH with the sequence pGlu-Leu/-Asn-Phe-Ser-Ser-Gly-Trp amide. The sequences were deduced from the multiple MS(N) electrospray mass data from crude CC extracts. Synthetic peptides were made and co-elution on reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with the natural peptide from crude gland extract confirmed the accuracy of the deduced sequence for Letin-AKH and demonstrated that Nepci-AKH contains a Leu residue at position 2 and not an  residue. A previously characterized member of the AKH/RPCH family was identified in the stick water scorpion Ranatra linearis by mass spectrometry: Grybi-AKH (pGlu-Val-Asn-Phe-Ser-Thr-Gly-Trp amide) has the same mass (919 Da) as Nepci-AKH and differs in two positions from Nepci-AKH (residues 2 and 6). The apparent function of the peptides is to achieve  mobilization in the species under investigation; indications for this came from conspecific bioassays using the appropriate synthetic peptides for injecting into the insects. This function is very likely linked to dispersal flight  of water bugs. Swimming activity in N. cinerea also results in an increase in  concentration in the hemolymph.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25430058>Structure refinement and membrane positioning of selectively labeled OmpX in phospholipid nanodiscs.</a></h2><p>NMR structural studies on membrane proteins are often complicated by their large size, taking into account the contribution of the membrane mimetic. Therefore, classical resonance assignment approaches often fail. The large size of phospholipid nanodiscs, a detergent-free phospholipid bilayer mimetic, prevented their use in high-resolution solution-state NMR spectroscopy so far. We recently introduced smaller nanodiscs that are suitable for NMR structure determination. However, side-chain assignments of a membrane protein in nanodiscs still remain elusive. Here, we utilized a NOE-based approach to assign (stereo-) specifically labeled , Leu, Val and Ala methyl labeled and uniformly (15)N-Phe and (15)N- labeled OmpX and calculated a refined high-resolution structure. In addition, we were able to obtain residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) of OmpX in nanodiscs using Pf1 phage medium for the induction of weak alignment. Back-calculated NOESY spectra of the obtained NMR structures were compared to experimental NOESYs in order to validate the quality of these structures. We further used NOE information between protonated lipid head groups and side-chain methyls to determine the position of OmpX in the phospholipid bilayer. These data were verified by paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments obtained with Gd(3+)-modified lipids. Taken together, this study emphasizes the need for the (stereo-) specific labeling of membrane proteins in a highly deuterated background for high-resolution structure determination, particularly in large membrane mimicking systems like phospholipid nanodiscs. Structure validation by NOESY back-calculation will be helpful for the structure determination and validation of membrane proteins where NOE assignment is often difficult. The use of protein to lipid NOEs will be beneficial for the positioning of a membrane protein in the lipid bilayer without the need for preparing multiple protein samples.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22453000>Identification of εPKC targets during cardiac ischemic injury.</a></h2><p>Epsilon-protein kinase C (εPKC) protects the heart from ischemic injury. However, the mechanism(s) of εPKC cardioprotection is still unclear. Identification of the εPKC targets may aid in elucidating the εPKC-mediated cardioprotective mechanisms. Previous studies, using εPKC transgenic mice and difference in gel electrophoresis, identified proteins involved in glucose , the expression of which was modified by εPKC. Those studies were accompanied by metabolomic analysis, suggesting that increased glucose oxidation may be responsible for the cardioprotective effect of εPKC. Whether these εPKC-mediated alterations were because of differences in protein expression or phosphorylation was not determined.In the present study, we used an εPKC -specific activator peptide, ψεRACK, combined with phosphoproteomics, to find εPKC targets, and identified that the proteins whose phosphorylation was altered by selective activation of εPKC were mostly mitochondrial proteins. Analysis of the mitochondrial phosphoproteome led to the identification of 55 spots, corresponding to 37 individual proteins, exclusively phosphorylated, in the presence of ψεRACK. The majority of the proteins identified were involved in glucose and , components of the respiratory chain as well as mitochondrial heat shock proteins.The protective effect of εPKC during ischemia involves phosphorylation of several mitochondrial proteins involved in glucose and  and oxidative phosphorylation. Regulation of these metabolic pathways by εPKC phosphorylation may lead to εPKC-mediated cardioprotection induced by ψεRACK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20042596>Structural basis for the association of the redox-sensitive target of rapamycin FATC domain with membrane-mimetic micelles.</a></h2><p>The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinase that regulates cellular growth in response to the nutrient and energy state. TOR signaling plays an important role in the development of diseases such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes and in different redox-sensitive processes (hypoxia, apoptosis, and aging). Because TOR has been detected at different cellular membranes and in the nucleus, its localization may influence the specific signaling readout. To better understand how TOR can associate with different membranes, the -binding properties of the redox-sensitive yeast TOR1 FATC domain (y1fatc) have been characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy. Binding studies with different lipids indicate that y1fatc interacts specifically with a membrane-mimetic environment but appears not to recognize a specific  headgroup. In both, the structures of oxidized and reduced micelle-bound y1fatc, residues -2456 to Trp-2470 of the -binding motif form a hydrophobic bulb that has a rim of charged residues. The diffusion constants for both micelle-bound states are consistent with the rotational correlation times from the analysis of the (15)N relaxation data. Based on the K(d) values, the oxidized form (K(d) approximately 0.31 mm) binds dodecyl phosphocholine micelles slightly tighter than the reduced form (K(d) approximately 1.86 mM). Binding studies with y1fatc in which one or both tryptophans (Trp-2466 and Trp-2470) were replaced by alanine suggest that these residues are important for the exact positioning in the membrane and that the other aromatic (His-2462, -2463, and Phe-2469) and aliphatic residues (-2456, Leu-2459, -2464, and Pro-2468) in the -binding motif contribute significantly to the affinity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964984>Purification and identification of antioxidant peptides from egg white protein hydrolysate.</a></h2><p>Egg white proteins were hydrolysed separately using five different proteases to obtain antioxidant peptides. The antioxidant activity of egg white protein hydrolysates was influenced by the time of hydrolysis and the type of enzyme. Of the various hydrolysates produced, papain hydrolysate obtained by 3-h hydrolysis (PEWPH) displayed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity. PEWPH could also quench the superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals, effectively inhibit  peroxidation and exhibit reducing power. Then, PEWPH was purified sequentially by ultrafiltration, gel filtration, RP-HPLC and two fractions with relatively strong antioxidant activity were subsequently subjected to LC-MS/MS for peptide sequence identification. The sequences of the two antioxidant peptides were identified to be -Leu-Gly-Ala-Lys (551.54 Da) and Gly-Gly-Leu-Glu-Pro--Asn-Phe-Gln (974.55 Da), and they were identified for the first time from food-derived protein hydrolysates. Last, the two purified peptides were synthesized and they showed 7.48- and 6.02-fold higher DPPH radical scavenging activity compared with the crude PEWPH, respectively.

The brain type 3 melanocortin receptors (M3R) play an important role in the central regulation of the  and the endocrine system. However, the influence of prolonged inhibition of M3R on energy , insulin resistance, and thyroid gland (TG) function is practically not studied. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of prolonged repeated immunization of male rats with the BSA-conjugated peptide Ala-[Pro-Thr-Asn-Pro--Cys--Cys-Thr-Thr-Ala-His269-280]-Ala (A[269- 280]A) corresponding to the third extracellular loop of M3R on their  parameters and functional activity of TG. 9 months after the first immunization, the weight of rats was reduced and after 12-13 months was significantly lower than in controls. The weight of abdominal and brown adipose tissues, on the contrary, increased. At the same timeline there was an increase in the fasting glucose and insulin levels, and increase of the HOMA-IR index (by 75%) indicating that immunized animals develop insulin resistance. The rats have increased glucose utilization due to an increase of insulin production by pancreatic β-cells. 12 months after the first immunization, the increase of the triglycerides level (by 74%) and the ratio of LDL- and HDL-cholesterol (by 36%) were revealed. 13 months after the start of immunization, the levels of free and total thyroxine and total triiodothyronine significantly decreased. In the TG plasma membranes of immunized rats the weakening adenylyl cyclase stimulating effect of thyroid-stimulating hormone was detected.

The NMR structure of Ca2+-bound Frq1 complexed to an N-terminal Pik1 fragment (residues 121-174) was determined. The Frq1 main chain is similar to that in free Frq1 and related proteins in the same branch of the calmodulin superfamily. The myristoyl group and first eight residues of Frq1 are solvent-exposed, and Ca2+ binds the second, third, and fourth EF-hands, which associate to create a groove with two pockets. The Pik1 peptide forms two helices (125-135 and 156-169) connected by a 20-residue loop. Side chains in the Pik1 N-terminal helix (Val-127, Ala-128, Val-131, Leu-132, and Leu-135) interact with solvent-exposed residues in the Frq1 C-terminal pocket (Leu-101, Trp-103, Val-125, Leu-138, -152, and Leu-155); side chains in the Pik1 C-terminal helix (Ala-157, Ala-159, Leu-160, Val-161, Met-165, and Met-167) contact solvent-exposed residues in the Frq1 N-terminal pocket (Trp-30, Phe-34, Phe-48, -51, -52, Phe-55, Phe-85, and Leu-89). This defined complex confirms that residues in Pik1 pinpointed as necessary for Frq1 binding by site-directed mutagenesis are indeed sufficient for binding. Removal of the Pik1 N-terminal region (residues 8-760) from its catalytic domain (residues 792-1066) abolishes  kinase activity, inconsistent with Frq1 binding simply relieving an autoinhibitory constraint. Deletion of the  kinase unique motif (residues 35-110) also eliminates Pik1 activity. In the complex, binding of Ca2+-bound Frq1 forces the Pik1 chain into a U-turn. Frq1 may activate Pik1 by facilitating membrane targeting via the exposed N-myristoyl group and by imposing a structural transition that promotes association of the  kinase unique motif with the kinase domain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26900151>Ligand Binding Induces Conformational Changes in Human Cellular Retinol-binding Protein 1 (CRBP1) Revealed by Atomic Resolution Crystal Structures.</a></h2><p>Important in regulating the uptake, storage, and  of retinoids, cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1) is essential for trafficking vitamin A through the cytoplasm. However, the molecular details of ligand uptake and targeted release by CRBP1 remain unclear. Here we report the first structure of CRBP1 in a ligand-free form as well as ultra-high resolution structures of this protein bound to either all-trans-retinol or retinylamine, the latter a therapeutic retinoid that prevents light-induced retinal degeneration. Superpositioning of human apo- and holo-CRBP1 revealed major differences within segments surrounding the entrance to the retinoid-binding site. These included α-helix II and hairpin turns between β-strands βC-βD and βE-βF as well as several side chains, such as Phe-57, -60, and -77, that change their orientations to accommodate the ligand. Additionally, we mapped hydrogen bond  inside the retinoid-binding cavity and demonstrated their significance for the ligand affinity. Analyses of the crystallographic B-factors indicated several regions with higher backbone mobility in the apoprotein that became more rigid upon retinoid binding. This conformational flexibility of human apo-CRBP1 facilitates interaction with the ligands, whereas the more rigid holoprotein structure protects the labile retinoid moiety during vitamin A transport. These findings suggest a mechanism of induced fit upon ligand binding by mammalian cellular retinol-binding proteins.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11720974>Influence of a  interface on protein dynamics in a fungal lipase.</a></h2><p>Lipases catalyze lipolytic reactions and for optimal activity they require a  interface. To study the effect of a  aggregate on the behavior of the enzyme at the interfacial plane and how the aggregate influences an attached substrate or product molecule in time and space, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations were performed over 1 to 2 ns using explicit SPC water. The interaction energies between protein and  are mainly due to van der Waals contributions reflecting the hydrophobic nature of the  molecules. Estimations of the protonation state of titratable residues indicated that the negative charge on the fatty acid is stabilized by interactions with the titratable residues -28, His-143, and His-257. In the presence of a  patch, the active site lid opens wider than observed in the corresponding simulations in an aqueous environment. In that lid conformation, the hydrophobic residues -85, -89, and Leu-92 are embedded in the  patch. The behavior of the substrate or product molecule is sensitive to the environment. Entering and leaving of substrate molecules could be observed in presence of the  patch, whereas the product forms strong hydrogen bonds with Ser-82, Ser-144, and Trp-88, suggesting that the formation of hydrogen bonds may be an important contribution to the mechanism by which product inhibition might take place.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12146486>Evaluation of isoleucine, leucine, and valine as a second-limiting amino acid for milk production in dairy cows fed grass silage diet.</a></h2><p>Five Finnish ruminally cannulated Ayrshire cows were used in a 5 x 5 Latin square trial with 14-d periods to determine whether branched-chain amino acids (AA) are the second- or colimiting AA for milk protein synthesis on grass silage-cereal based diet. Mammary  of AA as well as AA supply from the basal diet were also studied. Grass silage (17.5% crude protein) was given ad libitum with 9 kg/d as a cereal-based concentrate (13.8% crude protein). Treatments were basal diet without AA infusion (Control), abomasal infusion of AA mixture of His, , Leu, and Val at 8.5, 14.9,27.9, and 18.3 g/d, respectively, AA mixture minus , AA mixture minus Leu, and AA mixture minus Val. Glucose was infused on all treatments at 250 g/d. Amino acid infusions had no effect on dry matter intake (mean 19.2 kg/d), yields of milk (mean 25.3 kg/d), energy-corrected milk (mean 25.9 kg/d), milk protein (mean 807 g/d), lactose (mean 1261 g/d), or  (mean 1056 g/d). Milk composition was not affected by the treatments. Plasma concentrations of His and Val responded to AA infusions but concentration of  increased only on treatment AA mixture minus Leu, and concentration of Leu only on treatment AA mixture minus . Infusion of AA mixture of His, , Leu, and Val decreased plasma concentrations of Arg, Lys, Met, Phe, and . Amino acid infusions did not affect concentrations of plasma urea and energy metabolites or AA utilization by the mammary gland. Based on unchanged production parameters, the supply of His or branched-chain AA seemed not to be limiting under the current dietary conditions. Changes in plasma AA concentrations suggest either antagonism between individual AA in absorption or increased partitioning of AA into the muscle tissues. About 75% of omasal canal nonammonia nitrogen flow (427 g/d) was of microbial origin, and AA profiles of microbial protein and omasal canal digesta were fairly similar. Postruminal AA supply seems to be dependent on the basal diet, but variation may exist even within the similar basal diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25172761>Purification and characterization of three antioxidant peptides from protein hydrolyzate of croceine croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) muscle.</a></h2><p>Three antioxidant peptides were purified from protein hydrolysate of croceine croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) muscle prepared using pepsin and alcalase, and identified as -Leu-Met-Ser-Arg (PC-1), Val-Leu--Glu-Glu (PC-2), and Met--Leu-Met-Arg (PC-3) with molecular weights of 651.77, 668.82, and 662.92Da, respectively. PC-1 exhibited the highest scavenging activities on DPPH (EC50 1.35mg/ml), superoxide (EC50 0.450mg/ml), and ABTS (EC50 0.312mg/ml) radicals, but PC-2 exhibited the strongest hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (EC50 0.353mg/ml) among the three peptides. PC-1 also showed effective inhibition on lipid peroxidation in the model system. The good activities of isolated peptides might be benefit from the smaller size and hydrophobic and/or aromatic amino acids within their sequences.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A prototype supplement of ruminally protected Met and Lys was added to the 14% CP diet to provide 0, 50, 100, and 150% of the predicted deficiency of Met and Lys. The DMI; yields of milk, 3.5% FCM, total N, protein N, and whey N; plasma concentrations of Arg, Cit, His, , Leu, Orn, Phe, Pro, , Val, and urea N were greater for cows fed the 18% CP diet. Supplementing ruminally protected Met and Lys to the 14% CP diet did not affect DMI or yields of milk, 3.5% FCM, milk CP, and milk SNF. Milk  yield was affected quadratically because it was greater when 0 or 150% of the deficiency of Met and Lys was supplied. Percentages of CP and casein N in milk increased linearly as cows were fed increasing amounts of ruminally protected Met and Lys. Plasma concentrations of urea N, Met, and Lys increased when ruminally protected Met and Lys were fed; however, other nutrients probably were limiting for synthesis of milk and milk protein when cows were fed a 14% CP diet because yields of each were not increased by ruminally protected Met and Lys.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15453585>Antioxidant activity of peptides derived from egg white proteins by enzymatic hydrolysis.</a></h2><p>This work reports the antioxidant activity of peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of crude egg white with pepsin. Four peptides included in the protein sequence of ovalbumin possessed radical scavenging activity higher than that of Trolox. The hydrolysate of egg white with pepsin for 3 h was previously found to exhibit a strong angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in vitro. The combined antioxidant and ACE inhibition properties make it a very useful multifunctional preparation for the control of cardiovascular diseases, particularly hypertension. No correlation was found between antioxidant and ACE inhibitory activities. However, the peptide -Ala-Glu-Glu-Arg--Pro--Leu, which was a strong ACE inhibitor (50% inhibitory concentration, 4.7 microM) also exhibited a high radical scavenging activity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity-fluorescein value, 3.8 micromol of Trolox equivalent per micromol of peptide) and delayed the low-density lipoprotein  oxidation induced by Cu2+ at a concentration of approximately 0.16 mg/mg of low-density lipoprotein.

Seven residues, located on one face of a model alpha-helix spanning residues 59-75, are fully conserved in apoCII from ten different animal species. We have mutated these residues one by one. Substitution of Ala(59) by glycine, or Thr(62) and Gly(65) by alanine did not change the activation, indicating that these residues are outside the LPL-binding site. Replacement of (63), (66), Asp(69), or Gln(70) by alanine lowered the affinity for LPL and the catalytic activity of the LPL-apoCII complex. For each residue several additional replacements were made. Most mutants retained some activating ability, but replacement of (63) by phenylalanine or tryptophan and Gln(70) by glutamate caused almost complete loss of activity. All mutants bound to liposomes with similar affinity as wild-type apoCII, and they also bound with similar affinity to LPL in the absence of hydrolyzable lipids. However, the inactive mutants did not compete with wild-type apoCII in the activation assay. Therefore, we conclude that the productive apoCII-LPL interaction may be dependent on substrate molecules. In summary, our data demonstrate that residues 63, 66, 69, and 70 are of special importance for the function of apoCII, but no single amino acid residue is absolutely crucial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22884342>Milk protein synthesis in response to the provision of an "ideal" amino acid profile at 2 levels of metabolizable protein supply in dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Providing a well-balanced supply of essential AA (EAA) can serve as an opportunity to reduce the protein intake for dairy cows by increasing the efficiency of metabolizable protein (or PDIE, its equivalent in the INRA feeding system) utilization for milk protein yield. Our objectives were to compare the effect of supplying an "ideal" EAA profile (EAA+) with an imbalanced AA profile (control) at 2 levels of PDIE/NE(L) (net energy for lactation) supplies to study the interaction between PDIE and AA profiles, and to compare this ideal profile with a simple mixture of the 4 most deficient EAA (4 EAA) in the diets of dairy cows. Six lactating multiparous Holstein cows received 6 treatments with 2 different levels of PDIE supplied by diets and AA infusions in the duodenum according to a changeover design with 3-wk periods. Within each PDIE supply level, the cows received 3 different AA infusions in the duodenum according to a 3×3 Latin square design with 1-wk subperiods, which corresponded to the following treatment groups: control (Glu), 4EAA (Lys, Met, His, Leu), and EAA+ (4 EAA plus , Val, Phe, Trp, and ). In the low and high PDIE treatments, diets and infusions provided 54.7 and 64.0 g/Mcal of PDIE/NE(L), respectively, which corresponded to crude protein levels of 13.6 and 15.2%, respectively. High-PDIE supplies increased the milk protein yield by 163 g/d, the milk protein content by 1.4 g/kg, the milk yield by 4.1 kg/d, and the lactose yield by 178 g/d and decreased the PDIE efficiency of utilization by 12.4%, whereas the N efficiency of utilization remained unaffected. Supplying the 2 EAA profiles (4EAA and EAA+) increased the milk protein yield by 67 g/d, the milk protein content by 1.3g/kg, and the milk yield by 0.9 kg/d, whereas the milk fat and milk lactose contents were decreased by 2.4 and 1.6g/kg, respectively. The responses regarding milk yield and its composition were similar whether the cows received the 4 EAA or the EAA+ treatment. The responses were similar for the milk yield and composition whether the EAA were supplied by low- or high-PDIE supplies. In conclusion, the efficiency of PDIE utilization was improved by 6.6% and the N efficiency was improved by 7.0% by correcting the EAA profiles, independent of the level of PDIE supplied. In addition, the increased efficiency observed, associated with provision of the 4 EAA, was similar to the provision of all EAA (EAA+) in this experiment.Copyright © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.

Both the peptide and most lipids are chiral, so there is a possibility that interactions between peptide and  could require chiral recognition. On the other hand, in our models with small peptides, the extent of folding of the peptide to form a specific binding pocket is limited. We have determined that replacing cholesterol with its enantiomer, ent-cholesterol, alters the modulation of  organization by peptides. The phase-transition properties of SOPC (1-stearoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine):cholesterol [in a 6:4 ratio with 0.2 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P2] are not significantly altered when ent-cholesterol replaces cholesterol. However, in the presence of 10 mol% of a 19-amino-acid, N-terminally myristoylated fragment (myristoyl-GGKLSKKKKGYNVNDEKAK-amide) of the protein NAP-22 (neuronal axonal membrane protein), the  mixture containing cholesterol undergoes separation into cholesterol-rich and cholesterol-depleted domains. This does not occur when ent-cholesterol replaces cholesterol. In another example, when N-acetyl-Leu-Trp---Lys-amide (N-acetyl-LWYIK-amide) is added to SOPC:cholesterol (7:3 ratio), there is a marked increase in the transition enthalpy of the phospholipid, indicating separation of a cholesterol-depleted domain of SOPC. This phenomenon completely disappears when ent-cholesterol replaces cholesterol. The all-D-isomer of N-acetyl-LWYIK-amide also induces the formation of cholesterol-rich domains with natural cholesterol, but does so to a lesser extent with ent-cholesterol. Thus specific peptide chirality is not required for interaction with cholesterol-containing membranes. However, a specific chirality of membrane lipids is required for peptide-induced formation of cholesterol-rich domains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30609694>Preparation, Identification, and Activity Evaluation of Eight Antioxidant Peptides from Protein Hydrolysate of Hairtail () Muscle.</a></h2><p>In this report, protein of hairtail () muscle was separately hydrolyzed using five kinds of proteases (alcalase, trypsin, neutrase, pepsin, and papain), and the papain- and alcalase-hydrolysates showed higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals (DPPH•) and hydroxyl radical (HO•) scavenging activity than other three protease hydrolysates. Therefore, the protein hydrolysate of hairtail muscle (HTP) was prepared using binary-enzymes hydrolysis process (papain + alcalase). Subsequently, eight antioxidant peptides were purified from HTP using membrane ultrafiltration and chromatography technology, and their amino acid sequences were identified as Gln-Asn-Asp-Glu-Arg (TJP1), Lys-Ser (TJP2), Lys-Ala (TJP3), Ala-Lys-Gly (TJP4), Thr-Lys-Ala (TJP5), Val-Lys (TJP6), Met-Lys (TJP7), and --Gly (TJP8) with molecular weights of 660.3, 233.0, 217.1, 274.1, 318.0, 245.1, 277.0, and 351.0 Da, respectively. TJP3, TJP4, and TJP8 exhibited strong scavenging activities on DPPH• (EC 0.902, 0.626, and 0.663 mg/mL, respectively), HO• (EC 1.740, 2.378, and 2.498 mg/mL, respectively), superoxide anion radical (EC 2.082, 2.538, and 1.355 mg/mL, respectively), and 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical (EC 1.652, 0.831, and 0.586 mg/mL, respectively). Moreover, TJP3, TJP4, and TJP8 showed higher reducing power and inhibiting ability on  peroxidation in a linoleic acid model system. These results suggested that eight isolated peptides (TJP1 to TJP8), especially TJP3, TJP4, and TJP8 might serve as potential antioxidants applied in the pharmaceutical and health food industries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16733618>Gas chromatographic determination and mechanism of formation of D-amino acids occurring in fermented and roasted cocoa beans, cocoa powder, chocolate and cocoa shell.</a></h2><p>Fermented cocoa beans of various countries of origin (Ivory Coast, Ghana, Sulawesi), cocoa beans roasted under defined conditions (100-150 degrees C; 30-120 min), low and high  cocoa powder, various brands of chocolate, and cocoa shells were analyzed for their contents of free L-and D-amino acids. Amino acids were isolated from defatted products using a cation exchanger and converted into volatile N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl amino acid 2-propyl esters which were analyzed by enantioselective gas chromatography mass spectrometry on a Chirasil-L-Val capillary column. Besides common protein L-amino acids low amounts of D-amino acids were detected in fermented cocoa beans. Quantities of D-amino acids increased on heating. On roasting cocoa beans of the Forastero type from the Ivory Coast at 150 degrees C for 2 h, relative quantities of D-amino acids approached 17.0% D-Ala, 11.7% D-, 11.1% D-Asx (Asp + Asn), 7.9% D-, 5.8% D-Ser, 4.8% D-Leu, 4.3% D-Phe, 37.0% D-Pro, and 1.2% D-Val. In cocoa powder and chocolate relative quantities amounted to 14.5% D-Ala, 10.6% D-, 9.8% D-Phe, 8.1% L-Asx, and 7.2% D-. Lower quantities of other D-amino acids were also detected. In order to corroborate our hypothesis that D-amino acids are generated from Amadori compounds (fructose amino acids) formed in the course of the Maillard reaction, fructose-L-phenylalanine and fructose-D-phenylalanine were synthesized and heated at 200 degrees C for 5-60 min. Already after 5 min release of 11.7% D-Phe and 11.8% L-Phe in the free form could be analyzed. Based on the data a racemization mechanism is presented founded on the intermediate and reversible formation of an amino acid carbanion in the Amadori compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21177445>Changes in chemical composition in male turkeys during growth.</a></h2><p>In growing animals, requirements for many nutrients (and energy) are determined by the retention of these nutrients. During growth, this retention changes in an absolute way and also between nutrients and energy, resulting in changing nutrient requirements. The objective of this study was to describe the changes in chemical composition in male growing turkeys. The serial slaughter technique was used to determine the composition of amino acids, , ash, and water in feather-free body (FFB) and feathers in male turkeys offered feed ad libitum from 1 to 15 wk of age. Allometric relations were used to describe changes in body composition. The feather content in the body decreased from 6% at 1 wk of age to less than 3% at 15 wk of age. The water and protein content in FFB decreased with increasing FFB mass, with allometric scalars (b) of, respectively, 0.967 and 0.970, whereas the  content increased with increasing FFB mass (b = 1.388). The water, protein, and ash content in -free FFB was constant and represented, respectively, 71.6, 24.2, and 4.2% of the -free FFB mass. The amino acid content of FFB protein was relatively constant and only the Cys content decreased between 1 and 15 wk of age, whereas the  content increased. Feathers were mostly composed of protein, and the protein content did not change during growth. During growth, the Lys, Met, Trp, His, , Asp, and Glu contents in feather protein decreased, whereas the Cys, Val, and Ser contents increased. The contribution of feathers to whole-body amino acid retention ranged from 5% for His to 33% for Cys. On average, the weight gain of FFB contained 21.3% protein and 12.7% , corresponding to an energy content of 10.1 kJ/g. The weight gain of feathers contained 87.4% protein, corresponding to an energy content of 20.4 kJ/g. The results of the present study can be used in a factorial approach to determine nutrient requirements in growing turkeys.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22457392>Leucine is essential for attenuating fetal growth restriction caused by a protein-restricted diet in rats.</a></h2><p>Certain amino acids, such as leucine (Leu) are not only substrates for protein synthesis but also are important regulators of protein . Moreover, it is known that alterations in intrauterine growth favor the development of chronic diseases in adulthood. Therefore, we investigated the role of Leu in combination with other BCAA on effects that are induced by maternal protein restriction on fetal growth. Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups according to the diet provided during pregnancy: control (C; 20% casein); V+I [5% casein + 2% L-valine (Val) + 2% L-isoleucine ()]; KYT [5% casein + 1.8% L-lysine (Lys) + 1.2% L-tyrosine () + 1% L-threonine (Thr)]; and BCAA (5% casein + 1.8% L-Leu + 1.2% L-Val + 1% L-). Maternal protein restriction reduced the growth and organ weight of the offspring of dams receiving the V+I and KYT diets compared with the C group. Supplementation with BCAA reversed this growth deficit, minimizing the difference or restoring the mass of organs and carcass , the liver and muscle protein, and the RNA concentrations compared with newborns in the C group (P < 0.05). These effects could be explained by the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, because phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in the liver of offspring of the BCAA group was greater than that in the C, V+I, and KYT groups. The present results identify a critical role for Leu in association with other BCAA in the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway for the control of altered intrauterine growth induced by a maternal low-protein diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16569279>Effects of graded levels of duodenal infusions of leucine on mammary uptake and output in lactating dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Four multiparous Holstein cows, each equipped with a duodenal cannula and an ultrasonic mammary blood flow probe, were assigned to a 4x4 Latin square to measure the effects of duodenal infusions of Leu (0, 40, 80 and 120 g/d) on lactational responses and mammary  of nutrients. Cows were fed a diet of 67.0% corn silage, 5.3% grass hay, 14.2% peas, 7.8% maize starch, 1.0% each of molasses, urea, and sodium bicarbonate and 2.4% minerals and vitamins. Requirements of the remaining 9 essential amino acids were met by infusing into the duodenum 323 g/d of a mixture of amino acids including, , Val, Met, Lys, Trp, Phe, His, Thr, Arg,  and Glu. Milk protein content and yield were highest with 40 g/d of Leu and then progressively declined. Milk  content and yield were significantly decreased over the entire range of Leu infusions. Arterial concentrations of Leu increased linearly and corresponding mammary arterio-venous differences increased to a plateau with 80 g/d of Leu. As Leu infusions increased, extraction rates of Leu decreased linearly, whereas those of , Val, Lys, Arg, Thr and  were significantly increased. Leu was taken up by the mammary gland according to milk output with 0 and 40 g/d of Leu infused and then largely in excess. Based on responses of protein yield and mammary uptake to milk output ratio, Leu concentration in total amino acids absorbed in the small intestine needs to be close to 8.9% for optimal milk protein synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29606463>Know your fish: A novel compound-specific isotope approach for tracing wild and farmed salmon.</a></h2><p>The rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry with carnivorous fish such as salmon has been accompanied by an equally rapid development in alternative feed ingredients. This has outpaced the ability of prevailing authentication method to trace the diet and origins of salmon products at the retail end. To close this gap, we developed a new profiling tool based on amino acid δC fingerprints. With this tool, we discriminated with high-accuracy among wild-caught, organically, and conventionally farmed salmon groups, as well as salmon fed alternative diets such as insects and macroalgae. Substitution of fishmeal with macroalgae was detected at 5% difference level. The δC fingerprints of essential amino acids appear particularly well suited for tracing protein sources, and the non-essentials for tracing  origins (terrestrial vs. aquatic). In an industry constantly developing new feed proteins and functional additives, our method is a promising tool for tracing salmon and other seafood products.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A bimane probe was covalently attached to a cysteine residue in a series of single-cysteine mutant proteins to scan each helix in a residue-by-residue fashion. A variety of fluorescence properties of the bimane fluorophore were measured for both the soluble and membrane-bound states of the channel peptide, including the fluorescence emission maximum, fluorescence anisotropy, and membrane bilayer penetration depth. The fluorescence properties were collated for construction of a membrane-bound topology model of helices 4 and 5 of the channel domain. Finally, the data reveal that both helices 4 and 5 are two separate amphipathic alpha-helices that are situated parallel to the membrane surface. Dual fluorescence quencher analysis shows that helix 4 adopts a tilted topology in which its C-terminus is more buried than its N-terminus within the bilayer. In contrast, helix 5 is relatively solvent-exposed and located parallel to the interfacial region of the membrane surface. However, the loop region of both helices 4 and 5 was shown to be relatively buried within the bilayer. In addition, a least-squares fit of the data to a harmonic wave function indicated that both periodicity and frequency are typical for an amphipathic alpha-helix (3.75 +/- 0.1 residues per turn for helix 4 and 3.70 +/- 0.1 residues per turn for helix 5). Squared residual plots of the harmonic wave function also reveal that the N-terminus of helix 4 is elongated by two residues from Lys-406 to Phe-404, while the C-terminus of helix 5 is elongated by three residues from -434 to -437 upon membrane association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15889653>Ileal and total tract nutrient digestibility in blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) fed extruded diets containing different protein sources.</a></h2><p>This study compared apparent ileal and total tract digestibility of macronutrients and amino acids in blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) fed dry extruded diets. The control diet contained fish meal as the main protein source, while in the other diets 50% of the fish meal protein was replaced by not de-hulled solvent-extracted soybean meal, meat meal or bacterial protein meal. Ileal digestibility was obtained with animals modified with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA method). There were no significant differences in the average digestibility of CP, Lys, Trp, Val, Ala or Glu between IRA modified and intact animals. Average ileal digestibilities of His, Thr, Asp, Cys, Gly, Hyp, Pro, Ser, starch and total carbohydrates (CHO) were significantly lower compared with total tract values. Average ileal digestibility of Arg, , Leu, Met, Phe,  and crude  was significantly higher than total tract digestibility. Digestibility measured in IRA modified animals showed less variability compared with values from intact animals. There were significant differences among diets in ileal as well as total tract digestibility of orude protein, most amino acids, starch and CHO, and in ileal digestibility of crude . Ileal crude protein digestibility of the diets ranged from 81.0-86.4% and total tract digestibility from 82.5-86.4%. Ileal amino acid digestibilities ranged from 70.1 (Asp) to 93.3% (Arg) and total tract values ranged from 72.8 (Cys) to 92.2% (Arg). Both ileal and total tract digestibilities of crude protein and most amino acids were significantly lower for diets containing meat meal or bacterial protein meal compared with the control fish meal-based diet and the diet with soybean meal. Although ileal digestibility may be more accurate than total tract digestibility in estimating the protein and amino acid supply in blue foxes, total tract digestibility may be acceptable because of numerically small differences between ileal and total tract digestibilities for protein and most amino acids. It was further concluded that ileal digestibilities of starch and CHO in the blue fox are lower than corresponding total tract digestibilities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28378845>Central adiposity-induced plasma-free amino acid alterations are associated with increased insulin resistance in healthy Singaporean adults.</a></h2><p>Recent metabolomics technique reveals a plasma-free amino acid (PFAA)-based metabolite signature that is suggestive of altered PFAAs being an early manifestation of obesity-related insulin resistance. However, the PFAA profiles within non-obese, but more insulin-resistant Asians are not well researched. Compared with Caucasians, Asian populations have more central adiposity, which is generally regarded as metabolically more adverse, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we examined whether PFAA profiling was at least one important factor mediating central adiposity and insulin resistance, and aid in cardiovascular risk assessment in healthy Asians with normal body weight.This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 190 healthy men (n=87 with a mean±s.d. body mass index (BMI) of 23.5±3.5 kg/m) and women (n=103 with a mean±s.d. BMI of 21.4±3.7 kg/m) residing in Singapore took part in this study. PFAA levels were measured by using an amino acid analyzer. Basic anthropometric measurements, fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin and lipid profiles were obtained using standard protocols.Seven out of 18 amino acids were significantly correlated with measures of obesity (for example, waist circumference; waist-to-hip ratio and BMI) in current participants. Among them, the plasma concentrations of five amino acids, including Phe, , Met, Ala and His were positively associated with waist-to-hip ratio. With the exception of His, which had no association with insulin resistance, Phe, , Met and Ala were significantly associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (P<0.05). In contrast, no associations were observed between circulating BCAAs (that is, Val, Leu, ), measures of obesity and insulin resistance. However, significant inverse associations were observed between BCAAs and total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein.We found that central adiposity was associated with alterations of specific amino acids. As a result, PFAAs may serve as metabolite predictors of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia in healthy participants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22511205> signatures of insulin resistance in 7,098 young adults.</a></h2><p>Metabolite associations with insulin resistance were studied in 7,098 young Finns (age 31 ± 3 years; 52% women) to elucidate underlying  . Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model (HOMA-IR) and circulating metabolites quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in two population-based cohorts. Associations were analyzed using regression models adjusted for age, waist, and standard lipids. Branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, gluconeogenesis intermediates, ketone bodies, and fatty acid composition and saturation were associated with HOMA-IR (P < 0.0005 for 20 metabolite measures). Leu, , Val, and  displayed sex- and obesity-dependent interactions, with associations being significant for women only if they were abdominally obese. Origins of fasting metabolite levels were studied with dietary and physical activity data. Here, protein energy intake was associated with Val, Phe, , and Gln but not insulin resistance index. We further tested if 12 genetic variants regulating the metabolites also contributed to insulin resistance. The genetic determinants of metabolite levels were not associated with HOMA-IR, with the exception of a variant in GCKR associated with 12 metabolites, including amino acids (P < 0.0005). Nonetheless,  signatures extending beyond obesity and lipid abnormalities reflected the degree of insulin resistance evidenced in young, normoglycemic adults with sex-specific fingerprints.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7684378>Structure of the canine pancreatic colipase gene includes two protein-binding sites in the promoter region.</a></h2><p>Characterization of a lambda phage genomic clone, CL5A, which encodes the canine pancreatic colipase gene, revealed the primary structure of 987 nucleotides (nt) of 5'-flanking sequence, 2066 nt defining the primary transcriptional unit, which is organized into three exon sequences, and 130 nt of 3'-flanking sequence. Exon 1 encodes the amino-terminal signal peptide, the propeptide (Val1-Pro-Asp-Pro-Arg), and the hydrophobic -binding region (Gly6---) at the amino terminus of the mature coenzyme. Exon 2 encodes carboxylate residues (Glu12 and Glu15) likely to be involved in binding of pancreatic lipase to colipase at the aqueous- interface. Exon 3 encodes the hydrophobic sequence (Leu54--Gly--) that is essential for binding the central tightly structured disulfide-bonded region of the coenzyme to . Southern blot analysis was consistent with the presence of a single-copy colipase gene and a potential colipase gene homologue. Among 16 tissues examined by Northern blot analysis, colipase expression was detected only in pancreas. Proteins contained in nuclear extracts prepared from dog pancreas conferred two regions of DNase I protection coincident for both coding and noncoding strands (positions -62 to -44 (CL-I site) and -128 to -106 (CL-II site) in the coding strand). Competition gel mobility shift experiments indicated that protein-DNA interactions that occur at colipase sites I and II are sequence- and protein-specific and unrelated to the PAN-binding sequence described in the 5'-enhancer region of the rat chymotrypsin B gene (Nelson, C., Shen, L.-P., Meister, A., Fodor, E., and Rutter, W. J. (1990) Genes & Dev. 4, 1035-1043). Nuclear extracts from pancreas and brain, but not liver, contain similar CL-I- and CL-II-binding proteins. CL-I and CL-II represent protein-binding elements that may participate as additional promoter regions in regulated expression of the colipase gene. CL-I contains a central homopolymeric d(G) sequence. CL-II shows a GC-rich region on the noncoding strand (5' GGGGGCGTGT 3') that is similar (8/9 match) to the Sp1-binding sequence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22092715>Helicobacter pylori CagA-mediated IL-8 induction in gastric epithelial cells is cholesterol-dependent and requires the C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation-containing domain.</a></h2><p>Upon infection of the gastric epithelial cells, the Helicobacter pylori cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) virulence protein is injected into the epithelial cells via the type IV secretion system (TFSS), which is dependent on cholesterol. Translocated CagA is targeted by the membrane-recruited c-Src family kinases in which a tyrosine residue in the Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA)-repeat region, which can be phosphorylated, induces cellular responses, including interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion and hummingbird phenotype formation. In this study, we explored the role of EPIYA-containing C-terminal domain (CTD) in CagA tethering to the membrane  rafts and in IL-8 activity. We found that disruption of the  rafts reduced the level of CagA translocation/phosphorylation as well as CagA-mediated IL-8 secretion. By CagA truncated mutagenesis, we identified that the CTD, rather than the N-terminal domain, was responsible for CagA tethering to the plasma membrane and association with detergent-resistant membranes, leading to CagA-induced IL-8 promoter activity. Our results suggest that CagA CTD-containing EPIYAs directly interact with cholesterol-rich microdomains that induce efficient IL-8 secretion in the epithelial cells.© 2011 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

A subclinical mastitis case was determined as a cow having somatic cell count (SCC) > 200 000/mL of milk for two or more consecutive reports. Blood samples were collected from 100 Holstein dairy cows at five time points at -8 and -4 weeks before parturition, at the week of SCM diagnosis, and +4 and +8 weeks after parturition. Twenty healthy control cows (CON) and six cows that were diagnosed with SCM were selected for serum analysis with GC-MS. At -8 weeks a total of 13 metabolites were significantly altered in SCM cows. In addition, at the week of SCM diagnosis 17 metabolites were altered in these cows. Four weeks after parturition 10 metabolites were altered in SCM cows and at +8 weeks 11 metabolites were found to be different between the two groups. Valine (Val), serine (Ser), tyrosine (), and phenylalanine (Phe) had very good predictive abilities for SCM and could be used at -8 weeks and -4 weeks before calving. Combination of Val, isoleucine (), Ser, and proline (Pro) can be used as diagnostic biomarkers of SCM during early stages of lactation at +4 to +8 weeks after parturition. In conclusion, SCM is preceded and followed by alteration in AA .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7430115>Amino acid sequence of the signal peptide of apoVLDL-II, a major apoprotein in avian very low density lipoproteins.</a></h2><p>ApoVLDL-II is a major apoprotein in avian very low density lipoproteins (Jackson, R. L., Lin, H.-Y., Chan, L., and Means, A.R. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 250-253). Partially purified apoVLDL-II mRNA was translated in vitro in a wheat germ system in the presence of various labeled amino acids. The product, designated preapoVLDL-II, was purified by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was subjected to automated Edman degradation in a Beckman Sequencer. The signal peptide was found to be a 23-amino acid NH2-terminal extension of the mature protein with the following sequence: Met-Gln--Arg-Ala-Leu-Val--Ala-Val--Leu-Leu-Leu-Ser-Thr-Val-Pro-Glu-Val-Cys-Ser-Lys where Lys is the NH2-terminal residue of mature apoVLDL-II. The abundance and distribution of the hydrophobic amino acid residues are very similar to those of other signal sequences and the average hydrophobicity for the 23 residues is -1227 cal/mol/residue. However, translocation of preapoVLDL-II would represent a unique case of vectorial migration of a protein through a membrane since apoVLDL-II is itself an apolipoprotein and binds  spontaneously.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3093430>Fengycin--a novel antifungal lipopeptide antibiotic produced by Bacillus subtilis F-29-3.</a></h2><p>Fengycin is an antifungal lipopeptide complex produced by Bacillus subtilis strain F-29-3. It inhibits filamentous fungi but is ineffective against yeast and bacteria. The inhibition is antagonized by sterols, phospholipids and oleic acid, whereas two other unsaturated fatty acids increase the antifungal effect. Fengycin consists of two main components differing by one amino acid exchange. Fengycin A is composed of 1 D-Ala, 1 L-, 1 L-Pro, 1 D-allo-Thr, 3 L-Glx, 1 D-, 1 L-, 1 D-Orn, whereas in fengycin B the D-Ala is replaced by D-Val. The  moiety of both analogs is more variable, as fatty acids have been identified as anteiso-pentadecanoic acid (ai-C15), iso-hexadecanoic acid (i-C16), n-hexadecanoic acid (n-C16), and there is evidence for further saturated and unsaturated residues up to C18.</p></html>
