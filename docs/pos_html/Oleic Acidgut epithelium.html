<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23567058>A fatty gut feeling.</a></h1><p>The absorptive epithelium of the proximal small intestine converts  released during fat digestion into oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endogenous high-affinity agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α). OEA interacts with this receptor to cause a state of satiety characterized by prolonged inter-meal intervals and reduced feeding frequency. The two main branches of the autonomic nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic, contribute to this effect: the former by enabling OEA mobilization in the gut and the latter by relaying the OEA signal to brain structures, such as the hypothalamus, that are involved in feeding regulation. OEA signaling may be a key component of the physiological system devoted to the monitoring of dietary fat intake, and its dysfunction might contribute to overweight and obesity.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of the desaturase activity was present in the fat body tissue, with lower activity in the epidermis and no detectable activity in the thorax or  tissue. In incubations of microsomal preparations from fat body tissues with [1-14C]18:1-CoA, increased amounts of [1-14C]18:2 were found with increasing time and protein concentration. The form of the substrate for the delta 12 desaturase was determined to be 18:1-CoA by comparing activity towards [1-14C]18:1-CoA and [1-14C]18:1 transesterified to phospholipid. Ozonolysis of the 18:2 formed from [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA followed by radio-gas-liquid chromatography gave one labeled peak, 9-oxononanoate, which showed that the product of the delta 12 desaturase is the physiologically important isomer, 18:2(n - 6).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16022750>Dietary protein:lipid ratio and lipid nature affects fatty  absorption and metabolism in a teleost larva.</a></h1><p>Studies with teleost larvae have reported poor performance associated with quantitative lipid imbalances in the diet. The present study examined the effect of dietary protein:neutral lipid ratio on fatty  (FA) absorption efficiency and metabolism in larval Senegalese sole. In addition, the effect of lipid class (triolein (TRI) and l-3-phosphatidylcholine-1,2-di-oleoyl (PC)), carbon number and degree of saturation of the labelled NEFA, stearic  (SA),  (OA) and DHA) was tested. FA absorption was determined by tube feeding [1-14C]-labelled lipids and NEFA after a single meal of either non-enriched Artemia (NEA) or Artemia enriched on a soyabean oil emulsion (EA), or after feeding these diets over an extended period of time (18 d). The tested dietary protein:lipid ratios had no short-term influence but long-term feeding of a diet higher in neutral lipid (EA) increased lipid accumulation within the gut epithelium and resulted in lower FA absorption (higher label evacuation and lower retention of dietary FA), which may partially explain the trend for lower growth observed with this diet. The lipids and NEFA, showed different digestive and metabolic properties, independent of feeding regime. FA absorption increased with unsaturation, being lowest for SA, followed by OA, and highest for DHA. In addition, sole larvae had a lower capacity to digest and absorb FA esterified to TRI, compared with PC, with the order of decreasing absorption being NEFA>PC>>TRI. Moreover, larvae appeared to discriminate between the source of OA, as this FA in the free form or esterified to PC was catabolised less than TRI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1319382>Modulation of cellular phospholipid fatty acids and leukotriene B4 synthesis in the human intestinal cell (CaCo-2).</a></h1><p>The ability of a human colonocyte epithelial cell line (CaCo-2) to synthesise leukotriene B4 was examined. In addition, the effects of stimulation with calcium ionophore, inhibition by a drug which specifically prevents activation of 5-lipoxygenase, and modification of the fatty  composition of membrane phospholipids on leukotriene B4 synthesis were assessed. Incubation with calcium ionophore (A23187) resulted in a dose and time dependent increase in leukotriene B4 synthesis. After cell phospholipids had been enriched with , linoleic , and arachidonic , leukotriene B4 synthesis was found to be increased 3.2-fold, 5.5-fold, and 6.1-fold above control. Treatment with MK-886 inhibited leukotriene B4 synthesis by 79% to 94% in the various groups. Variations in the polyunsaturated fatty  content of intestinal epithelial cells could be important in the modulation of cellular responses. We have shown for the first time in this human intestinal epithelial cell its ability to synthesise leukotriene B4. In addition, leukotriene B4 synthesis can be modulated by the fatty  composition of membrane phospholipids, which can be altered by dietary fatty acids. The synthesis of chemotatic factors, such as leukotriene B4, by the mucosal epithelium may contribute to the recruitment of granulocytes into the colonic mucosa and across the epithelium, giving rise to the crypt abscesses which characterise ulcerative colitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647994>Palmitic  damages   integrity and initiates inflammatory cytokine production.</a></h1><p>The mechanisms leading to the low-grade inflammation observed during obesity are not fully understood. Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and . Saturated palmitic  impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated  did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic  induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the  alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to M2 pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with . Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of , which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
