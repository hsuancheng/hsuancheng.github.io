However, preventing CA infection in these patients is still a daunting challenge. Herein, inspired from the fact that immunization with secreted aspartyl proteinases 2 (Sap2) can prevent the infection, it is proposed to use filamentous phage, a human-safe virus nanofiber specifically infecting bacteria (≈900 nm long and 7 nm wide), to display an epitope peptide of Sap2 (EPS, with a sequence of Val----Ser) on its side wall and thus serve as a vaccine for preventing CA infection. The engineered virus nanofibers and recombinant Sap2 (rSap2) are then separately used to immunize mice. The humoral and cellular immune responses in the immunized mice are evaluated. Surprisingly, the virus nanofibers significantly induce mice to produce strong immune response as rSap2 and generate antibodies that can bind Sap2 and CA to inhibit the CA infection. Consequently, immunization with the virus nanofibers in mice dramatically increases the survival rate of CA-infected mice. All these results, along with the fact that the virus nanofibers can be mass-produced by infecting bacteria cost-effectively, suggest that virus nanofibers displaying EPS can be a vaccine candidate against fungal infection.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Through comprehensive analysis of multiple human protective antibodies, we previously identified four vulnerable sites (VS1-VS4) on the globular head domain. Among them, the VS1, occupying the opposite side of the RBS on the same HA, was defined by the epitope of antibody 65C6. In this study, we report the crystal structures of two additional human H5N1 antibodies isolated from H5N1-infected individuals, 3C11 and AVFluIgG01, bound to the head at 2.33- and 2.30-Å resolution, respectively. These two new antibody epitopes have large overlap with and extend beyond the original VS1. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments identified eight pivotal residues (Ser-126b, -165, Arg-166, Ser-167, -168, Asn-169, -171, and Asn-172) critical for 65C6-, 3C11-, and AVFluIgG01-binding and neutralization activities. These residues formed a unique "Y"-shaped surface on H5N1 globular head and are highly conserved among H5N1 viruses. Our results further support the existence of a vulnerable site distinct from the RBS and the stem region of H5N1 HA, and future design of immunogens should take this particular site into consideration.© 2019 Wang et al.</p></html>
