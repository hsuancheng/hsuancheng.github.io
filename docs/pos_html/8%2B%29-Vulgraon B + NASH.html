Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) adversely affects posttransplant outcomes, but its risk factors in relation to cholesterol metabolism have not been fully delineated. The apolipoprotein /A1 (Apo /A1) ratio, which is associated with insulin resistance, has not been evaluated in kidney transplant recipients as a risk factor for PTDM.The objective of this study was to determine whether serum apolipoprotein profiles predict late PTDM, defined as a new onset diabetes occurring greater than 3 months posttransplant.Retrospective chart review of a prevalent population of kidney transplant recipients.Large transplant center in Ontario, Canada.We identified 1104 previously nondiabetic adults who received a kidney transplant between January 1, 1998, and December 1, 2015, and were followed at 1 transplant center.Recipients provided testing for serum apolipoprotein  (Apo ) and apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1) concentrations from 2010, either at 3 months posttransplant for new transplant recipients or the next clinic visit for prevalent recipients. Late PTDM defined using Canadian Diabetes Association criteria as occurring ≥3 months posttransplant was recorded until May 1, 2016.All analyses were conducted with R, version 3.4.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Comparisons were made using Student  test, Fisher exact test or chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier methodology with the logrank test, or Cox proportional hazards analysis as appropriate. Covariates for the multivariate Cox proportional hazards models of PTDM as the outcome variable were selected based on significance of the univariate associations and biological plausibility.There were 53 incident late PTDM cases, or 1.71 cases per 100 patient-years. Incident late PTDM differed between the highest and lowest quartiles for Apo /A1 ratio, 2.47 per 100 patient-years vs 0.88 per 100 patient-years ( = .005 for difference). In multiple Cox regression analysis, first measured serum Apo /A1 concentration better predicted subsequent PTDM than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; hazard ratio [HR] = 7.80 per unit increase,  = .039 vs HR = 1.05 per unit increase,  = .774). Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations also did not predict PTDM ( = .136). By contrast to Apo , Apo A1 was protective against PTDM in statin users (HR = 0.17 per unit increase,  = .016).Posttransplant diabetes mellitus cases occurring before apolipoprotein testing was implemented were not included in the analysis.Apolipoproteins  and A1 better predict late PTDM than conventional markers of cholesterol metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534788>Associations of visceral fat thickness and anthropometric measurements with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease development in male patients mono-infected with human immunodeficiency virus.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common form of chronic liver disease in mono-infected (without concomitant hepatitis  and/or C virus infection) people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The proper and on time identification of at-risk HIV-positive individuals would be relevant in order to reduce the rate of progression from NAFLD into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.The aim of this study was to explore visceral fat thickness (VFT) and anthropometric measurements associated with the development of NAFLD in patients mono-infected with HIV and on long-standing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).Eighty-eight ( = 88) HIV-positive male patients, average age 39.94 ± 9.91 years, and stable on cART, were included in this prospective study. VFT was measured using ultrasonography. Anthropometric measurements included body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (W/H), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist and hip circumference (WC, HC). Differences between variables were determined using the chi-square test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Youden index were used to determine optimal cut-off values of VFT and hepatic steatosis. The area under the curve (AUC), 95% confidence intervals, sensitivity and specificity are reported for the complete sample. Significance was set at  < 0.05.Patients with steatosis had significantly higher values of BMI, HC, WC, W/H and WHtR. The VFT was higher in patients with steatosis ( < 0.001). Specifically, VFT values above 31.98 mm and age > 38.5 years correlated with steatosis in HIV-positive patients, namely sensitivity 89%, specificity 72%, AUC 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.93,  < 0.001), with the highest Youden index = 0.61. The sensitivity of the age determinant above this cut-off point was 84%, specificity 73% and AUC 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75-0.92,  < 0.001), with the highest Youden index of 0.57.In the absence of more advanced radiographic and histological tools, simple anthropometric measurements and VFT could assist in the early identification of persons at risk of hepatic steatosis in low- and middle-income regions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30500089>Natural selection for killer receptors and their MHC class I ligands: In pursuit of gene pairs that fit well in tandem.</a></h2><p>Our understanding of the genetic basis of host resistance to viral infection and disease has progressed significantly over the last century. Numerous genes coding for modifiers of immune functions have been identified, which impact a variety of critical cellular processes, including signaling via lymphocyte receptors and their ligands, signal transduction, cytokine signaling, production and release of cytotoxic effectors, transcriptional regulation, and proliferation. Genome-wide association studies implicate an important role for both highly polymorphic NK cell receptors and their MHC class I ligands in modifying host resistance. These findings indicate NK cells are critical mediators of viral control with considerable potential to affect morbidity and mortality outcomes. They further suggest that both stimulatory and inhibitory NK receptor polymorphisms alter NK cell sensing of MHC I ligands on viral targets, which influences how NK cells respond to infection. In many cases, however, the underlying causes associated with host outcomes remain elusive. Herein, we discuss several modes of NK cell sensing of MHC I and MHC I-like molecules on viral targets, and the role of genetic diversity in this evolutionarily dynamic process. We further suggest that natural selection for paired NK receptors with opposing function, but shared MHC I ligands may give rise to rare, but highly effective MHC I-dependent modes of NK cell sensing of viral targets.©2018 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31184928>Good association between sprint power and aerobic peak power during asynchronuous arm-crank exercise in people with spinal cord injury.</a></h2><p> To (1) investigate the association between sprint power and aerobic power output (POpeak) during a graded peak exercise test (GXT); and (2) validate the prediction models of POpeak based on sprint power and personal and lesion characteristics.  Wheelchair users with tetraplegia ( = 35) and paraplegia ( = 58) performed a 30 s-Wingate test and GXT on an asynchronous arm-crank ergometer. Data were split into samples to develop and validate the model. Sprint power (POmean and POpeak respectively) and POpeak were determined. Regression analyses were performed to develop POpeak prediction models. Candidate independent variables included POmean or POpeak, age (years), sex, body mass (kg) or BMI (kg/m), time since injury (TSI, years) and lesion level (tetraplegia/paraplegia). The best model was validated by comparing the predicted POpeak with measured POpeak.  The best model ( = 0.76) to predict POpeak included POmean, BMI and all other independent variables. No significant difference was found between measured (68 ± 35 W) and predicted POpeak (68 ± 30 W,  = 0.97). The ICC was excellent (0.89 with 95% confidence intervals: 0.75-0.95). The 95% limits of agreement for the Bland-Altman plots were wide (-30 to 31 W).  Strong associations were found between POmean and POpeak Although relative agreement was excellent, absolute agreement was low. Implications for rehabilitation There is a strong relationship between peak aerobic power output and sprint power output, both tested on an arm-crank ergometer, in people with spinal cord injury. A prediction model for peak aerobic power output, based on sprint power output and personal and lesion characteristics, showed a high explained variance. The predictive model can give a guideline for choosing the right graded exercise test protocol but should be used with caution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420528>Withaferin A Improves Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is the progressive stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that highly increases the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer, and there are few therapeutic options available in the clinic. Withaferin A (WA), extracted from the ayurvedic medicine , has a wide range of pharmacological activities; however, little is known about its effects on . To explore the role of WA in treating , two well defined  models were used, the methionine-choline-deficient diet and the 40 kcal% high-fat diet (HFD). In both  models, WA treatment or control vehicle was administered to evaluate its hepatoprotective effects. As assessed by biochemical and histologic analyses, WA prevented and therapeutically improved liver injury in both models, as revealed by lower serum aminotransaminases, hepatic steatosis, liver inflammation, and fibrosis. In the HFD-induced  model, both elevated serum ceramides and increased hepatic oxidative stress were decreased in the WA-treated group compared with the control vehicle-treated group. To further explore whether WA has an anti- effect independent of its known action in leptin signaling associated with obesity, leptin signaling-deficient ob/ob mice maintained on an HFD were used to induce . WA therapeutically reduced  in HFD-treated leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, thus demonstrating a leptin-independent hepatoprotective effect.

Spirulina was reported to possess hypolipemic and antioxidative effects and might counteract  development. C57Bl/6J mice were fed a western diet (WD) during 25 weeks with or without spirulina liquid extract (SLE) at 2 different doses (WDS1 and WDS2 groups) in drinking water. Liver histology, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed as well as glucose tolerance status, lipid metabolism, and gallbladder bile acid profile. WDS2 gained significantly less weight than WD. Liver weight-to-body weight ratio and plasma alanine aminotransferase were significantly lower in WDS2 mice. A reduced liver fibrosis and NFκBp65 protein expression were measured in the supplemented group as a lower accumulation of superoxide anion, nitric oxide, and thiobarbituric reactive substances. WDS2 mice showed also a preserved glucose tolerance, a strong decrease of plasma cholesterol, and a significant increase of gallbladder ursodeoxycholic acid and β-muricholic acid. Our findings demonstrate a protective effect of SLE against WD induced  that is related to less inflammation and oxidative stress, a preserved glucose tolerance, and less hepatotoxic bile acid profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332029>Role of Vitamin E for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>While vitamin E has shown to improve nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () in patients without diabetes, information on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is lacking. The aim of this study was to determine whether vitamin E, alone or combined with pioglitazone, improves histology in patients with T2DM and .This was a proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 2010 to 2016.

Consistently, iPla2β deletion protects hepatic steatosis and obesity in genetic ob/ob and obese mice chronically fed with high-fat diet by replenishing the loss of hepatic phospholipids (PL). As mouse feeding with methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet is a model of lean , we tested whether iPla2β-null mice could still be protected since PL syntheses are disturbed. MCD-diet feeding of female wild-type for 5 weeks induced hepatic steatosis with a severe reduction of body and visceral fat weights concomitant with a decrease of hepatic phosphatidylcholine. These parameters were not altered in MCD-fed iPla2β-null mice. However, iPla2β deficiency attenuated MCD-induced elevation of serum transaminase activities and hepatic expression of fatty-acid translocase Cd36, fatty-acid binding protein-4, peroxisome-proliferator activated receptorγ, and HDL-uptake scavenger receptor  type 1. The reduction of lipid uptake genes was consistent with a decrease of hepatic esterified and unesterified fatty acids and cholesterol esters. On the contrary, iPla2β deficiency under MCD did not have any effects on inflammasomes and pro-inflammatory markers but exacerbated hepatic expression of myofibroblast α-smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Thus, without any rescue of PL loss, iPla2β inactivation attenuated hepatocellular injury in MCD-induced  with a novel mechanism of lipid uptake inhibition. Taken together, we have shown that iPla2β mediates hepatic steatosis and lipotoxicity in hepatocytes in both obese and lean , but elicits exacerbated liver fibrosis in lean  likely by affecting other cell types.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

NAFLD carries an increased risk of cardio-metabolic and liver-related events accounting for a substantial economic burden. Given that the natural history of NAFLD is critically dependent on the stage of fibrosis, non-invasively identifying the subgroup of patients at a higher risk of progressive disease is key. : This review highlights the recent developments in the use of ultrasound-based techniques in NAFLD and their performance in predicting metabolic derangements, cardiovascular risk, and progression of liver disease, notably including diagnosis of fibrosing , identification, and treatment of HCC. : Our ability to identify NAFLD patients and to estimate steatofibrosis with various ultrasound-based techniques has undergone tremendous progress over the last few years. However, it is more difficult to capture the inflammatory component of  with such ultrasound-assisted techniques.

Moreover, lipotoxicity is crucial for the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Autophagy is required for the clearance of protein aggregates or damaged mitochondria to maintain cellular metabolic homeostasis. The NFE2L2/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2)-KEAP1 (kelch like ECH associated protein 1) pathway is essential for the elimination of ROS. ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; yeast Atg1) is involved in the initiation of autophagy; however, its role in lipotoxicity-induced cell death in hepatocytes and mouse liver has not been elucidated. We now show that ULK1 potentiates the interaction between KEAP1 and the autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62, thereby mediating NFE2L2 activation in a manner requiring SQSTM1-dependent autophagic KEAP1 degradation. Furthermore, ULK1 is required for the autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria and to enhance binding between SQSTM1 and PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1). This study demonstrates the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytoprotective role of ULK1 against lipotoxicity. Thus, ULK1 could represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of .

In this study, we assessed the effect of Silybin in a well-established in vitro coculture model of early-stage . LX2 and Huh7 cells were exposed to free fatty acid (FFA) and Silybin as mono- or coculture (SCC). Cell viability, LX2 activation, collagen deposition, metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP2-9) activity, and ROS generation were determined at 24, 96, and 144 h. Exposure to FFA induced the activation of LX2 as shown by the increase in cell viability and upregulation of collagen biosynthesis. Interestingly, while cotreatment with Silybin did not affect collagen production in LX2, a significant reduction was observed in SCC. MMP2-9 activity was reduced in FFA-treated Huh7 and SCC and cotreatment with Silybin induced a dose-dependent increase, while no effect was observed in LX2. Silybin also showed antioxidant properties by reducing the FFA-induced production of ROS in all the cell systems. Based on these data, Silybin exerts its beneficial effects by reducing LX2 proliferation and ROS generation.

The major risk factors for HCC development are chronic liver disease and cirrhosis due to hepatitis  virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), steatohepatitis, intake of aflatoxin-contaminated food, diabetes, and obesity.In Western countries, the number of -related HCC cases is increasing, that of HBV- or HCV-related cases is declining due to the wide application of HBV universal vaccination and the introduction of effective therapies against HBV and HCV infections, and that of alcohol-related cases remaining substantially unchanged. Nevertheless, the burden of HCC is expected to increase worldwide in the next few decades, due to the population growth and aging expected in coming years. Overall, the abovementioned changes and future variations in lifestyle and in the impact of environmental factors in Western countries and a decreasing exposure to dietary aflatoxins and improved socio-economic conditions in developing countries will create new HCC epidemiology in the next few decades.A substantial further reduction in cases of HCC requires a wider application of universal HBV vaccination and effective treatment of HBV- and HCV-related chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, more effective campaigns to favor correct dietary habits and reduce alcohol consumption and the intensification of studies on HCC pathogenesis for future optimized prevention strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30176114>Relationship between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, PNPLA3 I148M genotype and bone mineral density in adolescents.</a></h2><p>It is uncertain whether non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is a risk factor for low bone mineral density (BMD).

These include 122 metabolites: amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, vitamins, bile acids, flavonoids, xenobiotics, and carbohydrates. Hepatic amino acids, -vitamins, and bile acids are inversely correlated with biomarkers of insulin resistance, liver injury, steatosis, and inflammation. Further, phosphatidylcholine metabolites are positively correlated with biomarkers of liver injury and NFκ inflammation. Thirteen catechin metabolites are identified in livers of GTE-treated mice, mostly as phase II conjugates of parental catechins or microbial-derived valerolactones.The defined anti-inflammatory/metabolic interactions advance an understanding of the mechanism by which GTE catechins protect against NFκ-mediated liver injury in .© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Information regarding drugs as triggers of ACLF is lacking. We examined data regarding drugs producing ACLF and analyzed clinical features, laboratory characteristics, outcome, and predictors of mortality in patients with drug-induced ACLF.We identified drugs as precipitants of ACLF among prospective cohort of patients with ACLF from the Asian Pacific Association of Study of Liver (APASL) ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) database. Drugs were considered precipitants after exclusion of known causes together with a temporal association between exposure and decompensation. Outcome was defined as death from decompensation.Of the 3,132 patients with ACLF, drugs were implicated as a cause in 329 (10.5%, mean age 47 years, 65% men) and other nondrug causes in 2,803 (89.5%) (group ). Complementary and alternative medications (71.7%) were the commonest insult, followed by combination antituberculosis therapy drugs (27.3%). Alcoholic liver disease (28.6%), cryptogenic liver disease (25.5%), and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () (16.7%) were common causes of underlying liver diseases. Patients with drug-induced ACLF had jaundice (100%), ascites (88%), encephalopathy (46.5%), high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) (30.2), and Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (12.1). The overall 90-day mortality was higher in drug-induced (46.5%) than in non-drug-induced ACLF (38.8%) (P = 0.007). The Cox regression model identified arterial lactate (P < 0.001) and total bilirubin (P = 0.008) as predictors of mortality.Drugs are important identifiable causes of ACLF in Asia-Pacific countries, predominantly from complementary and alternative medications, followed by antituberculosis drugs. Encephalopathy, bilirubin, blood urea, lactate, and international normalized ratio (INR) predict mortality in drug-induced ACLF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30114977>Equilibrium Distributions of Populations of Biological Species on Networks of Social Sites.</a></h2><p>We investigate the problem of how a population of biological species would distribute over a given network of social sites so that their social contacts through the connected sites can be maximized (or minimized). This problem has applications in modelling the behaviours of social (or solitary) species such as the development of social groups in human society and the spread of solitary animals in distant habitats. We show that this problem can be formulated as an evolutionary game, with the equilibrium state of the game corresponding to a strategy for choosing the residing sites, each with a certain probability, or equivalently, to a distribution of the population on these sites. The game has a symmetric payoff matrix, and can therefore be analyzed via the solution of a corresponding quadratic programme: An equilibrium strategy of the game is a KKT point of the quadratic programme, which may be a local maximizer, local minimizer, or saddle point, but it is evolutionarily stable if and only if it is a strict local maximizer. In general, with a goal to maximize the social contacts, the species tend to spread on network sites where there are dense connections such as a complete subnetwork or in other words, a network clique. We show that at equilibrium, the population may or may not distribute on a network clique, but the stability of the equilibrium state does depend on the structure of the selected subnetwork. In particular, we show that the distribution of the population on a maximal network clique is evolutionarily stable unless the clique is 'attached' to another clique of the same or larger size, when the population may be able to switch or expand to the neighbouring clique to increase or at least maintain its total amount of contacts. However, the distribution of the population on a non-clique subnetwork is always evolutionarily unstable or weakly evolutionarily stable at the very best, for the population can always move away from its current distribution without decreasing its total amount of contacts. We conclude that the strategies to spread on maximal network cliques are not only equilibrium strategies but also evolutionarily more stable than those on non-clique subnetworks, thus theoretically reaffirming the evolutionary advantages of joining social cliques in social networks for social species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31012626>Observation of Two Excited _{c}^{+} States and Measurement of the _{c}^{+}(2S) Mass in pp Collisions at sqrt[s]=13  TeV.</a></h2><p>Signals consistent with the _{c}^{+}(2S) and _{c}^{*+}(2S) states are observed in proton-proton collisions at sqrt[s]=13  TeV, in an event sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 143  fb^{-1}, collected by the CMS experiment during the 2015-2018 LHC running periods.

These compounds have a variety of potential medicinal properties and we have shown that some of them promote the expression of ceramide synthase 3. We now report on the beneficial effects of ginnalin , (6-O-galloyl-1,5-AG, 5), leading to acceleration of skin metabolism and reduction of the turnover time. Ginnalin  dose-dependently increased the relative amount of keratin 10, keratin 1, and filaggrin gene, with maximal increase of 1.7-, 2.9, and 5.2-fold at 100 μM, respectively. The validation study showed that it had superior capacity to induce multiple stages of keratinocyte differentiation and significantly elevated the immunostaining site of keratin 10 and filaggrin in a 3-dimensional cultured human skin model, by 1.2 and 2.8-fold, respectively. Furthermore, ginnalin  caused the arrest of proliferation at the G/G phase but it did not induce apoptotic cell death in normal human keratinocytes. Molecular studies revealed that ginnalin  up-regulated the levels of NOTCH1 and a concomitant increase p21 expression. Ginnalin , therefore, represents a new class of promising functional and medical cosmetic compound and it could contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis of the epidermis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As the understanding of AD has progressed, it is now believed that AD is an amyloid-initiated tauopathy with neuroinflammation serving as the link between amyloid deposition, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration. As microglia are the main immune effectors in the central nervous system, they have been the focus of attention in studies investigating the neuroinflammatory component of AD. Therefore, recent work has focused on immunomodulators, which can alter microglial activation without suppressing activity, as potential therapeutics for AD. Fractalkine (CX3CL1; FKN), a unique chemokine with a one-to-one relationship with its receptor, signals through its cognate receptor (CX3CR1) to reduce expression of pro-inflammatory genes in activated microglia. Disrupting FKN signaling has opposing effects on the two hallmark pathologies of AD, but over-expressing a soluble FKN has been shown to reduce tau pathology while not altering amyloid pathology. Recently, differential signaling has been reported when comparing two cleavage variants of soluble FKN. These differential effects may explain recent studies reporting seemingly conflicting results regarding the effect of FKN over expression on AD pathologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30690636>Interactions between the cecal microbiota and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis using laying hens as the model.</a></h2><p>Chronic liver disease has caused increasing numbers of deaths worldwide. Fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome, one of the chronic liver diseases in laying hens, has great similarity to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans. It is characterized by the pathological accumulation of liver fat. Non-invasive techniques are needed for early identification of fibrosis. As primary de novo lipogenesis in the liver of chicken is similar to that of humans, mature chicken is an ideal animal model for the understanding of NAFLD. This study was aimed to evaluate the relationships between gut microbiota and natural chronic liver disease (i.e., non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [] and fibrosis stages) in a well-characterized laying hen population. One hundred 20-wk-old Hy-Line Brown laying hens were used and fed with basal diets until 52 wk of age. At the end of the experiment, birds were killed for sampling blood, liver, and cecal contents, and then classified by liver histology measurement into different groups. We investigated microbial community structure of cecum using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Subjects in stage 0 fibrosis without  were classified as low NAFLD (Group A), subjects in stage 1-2 fibrosis with mild to moderate  were defined as low  (Group ), and subjects in stage 3 fibrosis were defined as severe  (Group C). The abundance of Firmicutes was reduced in Groups  and C (P < 0.001), whereas opposite results were observed for the abundance of Bacteroidetes. Additionally, the families Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae Lachnospiraceae, and lactobacillae were significantly different between groups of differing fibrosis stages (P < 0.001), driven entirely by alterations of Bacteroides and lactobacillus and lachnospiraceae genera (P < 0.001), were observed. Results indicated that cecal dysbiosis was linked with the severity of fibrosis and ; importantly, increased levels of serum AST, alkaline phosphatase, and uric acid were accompanied with liver fibrosis and  severity. Collectively, these data highlight the role of gut-liver axis and associations between the gut microbiota and fibrosis and  severity.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30284852>The effects of social power and apology on victims' posttransgression responses.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this research was to test how, why, and when social power influences victims' revenge seeking, grudge holding, and forgiveness.

Regarding this, the common diseases of HIV population (i.e., opportunistic infections) are now losing ground in front of metabolic alterations. This phenomenon is related to the delay in progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), making it so that patients live in a chronic inflammatory state which, combined with other mechanisms such infectious ones, cause metabolic diseases. Areas covered: Considering a high prevalence of metabolic alterations, the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), and liver diseases as a major cause of death in the HIV-infected population, this paper aims to overview the mechanisms and prevalence of NAFLD and  as they relate to the developed metabolic diseases of HIV patients. Expert opinion: The pathways underlying MetS include the effects of HIV and ART on the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle. These mechanisms result in liver damage, consequently leading to NAFLD and its more severe form .

The use of social media, specifically Twitter, has become a popular platform for understanding public health trends and for performing health care research. To evaluate this, we studied the areas of public interest and social media trends of the following three major CLDs: hepatitis  virus (HBV), HCV, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Twitter activity data from January 1, 2013, through January 1, 2019, for HBV, HCV, and NAFLD/ were collected using the social media analytic tool Symplur Signals (Symplur LLC) software. Content and regression analyses were performed to understand and predict Twitter activity for each of the CLDs. Over the study period, there were 810,980 tweets generating 4,452,939,516 impressions. HCV tweet activity peaked in 2015 at 243,261 tweets, followed by a decline of 52.4% from 2015 to 2016 with a subsequent plateau through 2018. Meanwhile, NAFLD/ and HBV tweet activity has continued to increase, with projections that these two CLDs will surpass HCV by the second half of 2023 and 2024, respectively. Treatment and Management was the most popular content category for HCV and NAFLD/, while Prevention was the most popular content category for HBV.  Twitter is a useful social media tool to gauge public interest in liver disease over time. The information provided by Twitter can be used to identify gaps in public knowledge or highlight areas of interest that may need further research. Future studies on the use of Twitter in liver disease are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30221597>Effect of Aspirin on Cardiovascular Events and Bleeding in the Healthy Elderly.</a></h2><p>Aspirin is a well-established therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. However, its role in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is unclear, especially in older persons, who have an increased risk.From 2010 through 2014, we enrolled community-dwelling men and women in Australia and the United States who were 70 years of age or older (or ≥65 years of age among blacks and Hispanics in the United States) and did not have cardiovascular disease, dementia, or disability. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo. The primary end point was a composite of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability; results for this end point are reported in another article in the Journal. Secondary end points included major hemorrhage and cardiovascular disease (defined as fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure).Of the 19,114 persons who were enrolled in the trial, 9525 were assigned to receive aspirin and 9589 to receive placebo. After a median of 4.7 years of follow-up, the rate of cardiovascular disease was 10.7 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 11.3 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.08). The rate of major hemorrhage was 8.6 events per 1000 person-years and 6.2 events per 1000 person-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.62; P<0.001).The use of low-dose aspirin as a primary prevention strategy in older adults resulted in a significantly higher risk of major hemorrhage and did not result in a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease than placebo.

Good understanding of the transport system and hydrological processes in the dam is very crucial to its sustainability. Under optimal functionality, the Shiroro dam in Northern Nigeria can generate ∼600 MW, which is ideally sufficient to power about 404,000 household. Unfortunately, there have not been reliable monitoring measures to assess yield in the upstream, where sediments are sourced into the dam. In this study, we applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict the hydrological processes, the sediment transport mechanism and sediment yield between 1990 and 2018 in Kaduna watershed (32,124 km) located upstream of the dam. The model was calibrated and validated using observed flow and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) data. Performance evaluation of the model was achieved statistically using -Sutcliffe (NS), coefficient of determination (r) and percentage of observed data (p-factor). SWAT model evaluation using NS (0.71), r (0.80) and p-factors of 0.86 suggests that the model performed satisfactorily for streamflow and sediment yield predictions. The model identified the threshold depth of water (GWQMN.gw) and base flow (ALPHA_BF.gw) as the most sensitive parameters for streamflow and sediment yield estimation in the watershed. Our finding showed that an estimated suspended sediment yield of about 84.1 t/ha/yr was deposited within the period under study. Basins 67, 71 and 62 have erosion prone area with the highest sediment values of 79.4, 75.1 and 73.8 t/h respectively. Best management practice is highly recommended for the dam sustainability, because of the proximity of erosion-prone basins to the dam.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30080444>Interaction between plasma homocysteine and the MTHFR c.677C > T polymorphism is associated with site-specific changes in DNA methylation in humans.</a></h2><p>One-carbon metabolism provides a direct link among dietary folate/vitamin  exposure, the activity of the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and epigenetic regulation of the genome via DNA methylation. Previously, it has been shown that the common c.677C > T polymorphism in MTHFR influences global DNA methylation status through a direct interaction with folate status and (indirectly) with total homocysteine (tHcy) levels. To build on that and other more recent observations that have further highlighted associations among MTHFR c.677C > T, tHcy, and aberrations in DNA methylation, we investigated whether the interaction between mildly elevated plasma tHcy and the c.677C > T polymorphism is associated with site-specific changes in DNA methylation in humans. We used data on plasma tHcy levels, c.677C > T polymorphism, and site-specific DNA methylation levels for a total of 915 white women and 335 men from the TwinsUK registry ( n = 610) and the Rotterdam study ( n = 670). We performed methylome-wide association analyses in each cohort to model the interaction between levels of tHcy and c.677C > T genotypes on DNA methylation β values. Our meta-analysis identified 13 probes significantly associated with rs1801133 × tHcy levels [false-discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05]. The most significant associations were with a cluster of probes at the AGTRAP-MTHFR-NPPA/ gene locus on chromosome 1 (FDR = 1.3E-04), with additional probes on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 16, and 19. Our top 2 hits on chromosome 1 were functionally associated with variability in expression of the TNF receptor superfamily member 8 ( TNFRSF8) gene/locus on that chromosome. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to provide a direct link between perturbations in 1-carbon metabolism, through an interaction of tHcy and the activity of MTHFR enzyme on epigenetic regulation of the genome via DNA methylation.-, A.

We know that trauma center care improves outcomes for injured patients generally, and palliative care processes can improve outcomes for disease-specific conditions, and our goal was to determine effectiveness of these interventions on outcomes for geriatric trauma patients.A priori questions were created regarding outcomes for patients 65 years or older with respect to care at trauma centers versus nontrauma centers and use of routine palliative care processes. A query of MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE was performed. Letters to the editor, case reports, book chapters, and review articles were excluded. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to perform a systematic review and create recommendations.We reviewed seven articles relevant to trauma center care and nine articles reporting results on palliative care processes as they related to geriatric trauma patients. Given data quality and limitations, we conditionally recommend trauma center care for the severely injured geriatric trauma patients but are unable to make a recommendation on the question of routine palliative care processes for geriatric trauma patients.As our older adult population increases, injured geriatric patients will continue to pose challenges for care, such as comorbidities or frailty. We found that trauma center care was associated with improved outcomes for geriatric trauma patients in most studies and that utilization of early palliative care consultations was generally associated with improved secondary outcomes, such as length of stay; however, inconsistency and imprecision prevented us from making a clear recommendation for this question. As caregivers, we should ensure adequate support for trauma systems and palliative care processes in our institutions and communities and continue to support robust research to study these and other aspects of geriatric trauma.Systematic review/guideline, level III.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261763>An update on the recent advances in antifibrotic therapy.</a></h2><p>Chronic injury to the liver, such as viral hepatitis, alcoholism, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), promotes extracellular matrix deposition and organ scarring, termed hepatic fibrosis.

Because early-stage diagnosis improves survival, guidelines recommend screening patients at risk for HCC, such as patients with cirrhosis. However, adherence to screening programs is suboptimal. In this review, we discuss the value of HCC screening and provide practical guidance on patient selection and screening methods. International guidelines concordantly recommend HCC screening in patients with cirrhosis, including patients with HBV infections, hepatitis C virus infections with or without sustained virologic response, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. There is no consensus on screening patients without cirrhosis, although patients with advanced fibrosis, HBV infections, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease without cirrhosis have an increased risk for development of HCC. Screening for HCC improves early tumor detection, receipt of curative treatment, and overall survival in at-risk patients. However, potential harms of HCC screening have not been well quantified. Semiannual abdominal ultrasonography is the screening modality of choice. Using ultrasonography in combination with biomarkers, such as α-fetoprotein, may increase accuracy for early HCC detection. The use of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography is limited by cost-effectiveness and practical considerations. Increased awareness of HCC screening will allow for earlier diagnosis and potentially curative treatment. We propose a comprehensive screening algorithm for patients at risk for development of HCC, recommending lifelong, semiannual ultrasonography combined with α-fetoprotein testing in patients with cirrhosis and selected patients without cirrhosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587343>Letter to the Editor: Impact of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis on liver-related outcomes in chronic hepatitis .</a></h2><p>We read with great interest the article by Choi et al. reporting the impacts of concomitant non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () on the clinical outcomes and all-cause mortality in chronic hepatitis  (CHB) patients.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high-fat diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10). Liver histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with fatty acid with or without myriocin treatment. Lipid accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults, liver biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and liver biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis  (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated body weight and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated liver pathology including steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of fatty acid metabolism associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-2. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced , and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in  patients as compared to the controls and non- patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of . Hence, blockade of ceramide signaling by myriocin may be of therapeutically beneficial in .Registration ID: ChiCTR-DDT-13003983 .

Surgery is often observed to ameliorate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), but without a clearly delineated mechanism. In this study, we investigated the effects of DJB in diet-induced obese rats with .Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups and fed the following diets over 6 months: A) normal chow (NC group, n=6); ) methionine-choline-deficient (MCD)-high-fat (HF) diet (HF group, n=6); C) MCD-HF diet for 3 months followed by DJB and MCD-HF diet for subsequent 3 months (DJB group, n=6); and D) MCD-HF diet for 3 months followed by treatment with pioglitazone (PGZ) with MCD-HF diet for subsequent 3 months (PGZ group, n=6). Body weight, glucose tolerance, the homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance index, and lipid profiles were compared. Liver and visceral adipose tissue histology, inflammatory marker and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activity, and hepatocyte autophagy were assessed.Compared with the HF group, the DJB group showed improved body weight, insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, and steatosis severity. The DJB group exhibited a significantly lower nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score than the HF and PGZ group (<0.001 and =0.003, respectively). Furthermore, DJB significantly reduced fat mass and adipocyte size. These effects were also observed in the PGZ group. Therefore, we speculated that the improvements induced by DJB are closely related to an alteration in insulin sensitivity. Moreover, DJB reduced HSC activity and TNF-α expression and enhanced hepatocyte autophagy.DJB improves  through several mechanisms, particularly by altering insulin sensitivity, inflammatory responses, HSC activity, and hepatocyte autophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30221596>Effect of Aspirin on Disability-free Survival in the Healthy Elderly.</a></h2><p>Information on the use of aspirin to increase healthy independent life span in older persons is limited. Whether 5 years of daily low-dose aspirin therapy would extend disability-free life in healthy seniors is unclear.From 2010 through 2014, we enrolled community-dwelling persons in Australia and the United States who were 70 years of age or older (or ≥65 years of age among blacks and Hispanics in the United States) and did not have cardiovascular disease, dementia, or physical disability. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg per day of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo orally. The primary end point was a composite of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability. Secondary end points reported in this article included the individual components of the primary end point and major hemorrhage.A total of 19,114 persons with a median age of 74 years were enrolled, of whom 9525 were randomly assigned to receive aspirin and 9589 to receive placebo. A total of 56.4% of the participants were women, 8.7% were nonwhite, and 11.0% reported previous regular aspirin use. The trial was terminated at a median of 4.7 years of follow-up after a determination was made that there would be no benefit with continued aspirin use with regard to the primary end point. The rate of the composite of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability was 21.5 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 21.2 per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.11; P=0.79). The rate of adherence to the assigned intervention was 62.1% in the aspirin group and 64.1% in the placebo group in the final year of trial participation. Differences between the aspirin group and the placebo group were not substantial with regard to the secondary individual end points of death from any cause (12.7 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 11.1 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group), dementia, or persistent physical disability. The rate of major hemorrhage was higher in the aspirin group than in the placebo group (3.8% vs. 2.8%; hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.62; P<0.001).Aspirin use in healthy elderly persons did not prolong disability-free survival over a period of 5 years but led to a higher rate of major hemorrhage than placebo.

Understanding prevalence and predictors of  with advanced fibrosis is critical for healthcare resource planning. Using a large U.S. clinical laboratory database from 10/1/2017-9/30/2018, adults negative for hepatitis  and hepatitis C and after excluding for alcoholic liver disease and pregnancy were evaluated for prevalence of F3 and F4 fibrosis using a systematic algorithm of five fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) criteria: Criteria 1 (≥F3: >2.67), Criteria 2 (2.67<F3≤4.12 and F4>4.12), Criteria 3 (2.67<F3≤3.15, F4>3.15), Criteria 4 (3.25<F3≤3.5, F4>3.5), Criteria 5 (3.25<F3≤4.12, F4>4.12). Metabolic co-morbidities evaluated included decreased high density lipoprotein (<40 mg/dL men, <50 mg/dL women), high triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL), elevated hemoglobin A1C (≥6.5%). Parallel analyses of patients with specific NAFLD/ ICD-9/10 codes from 10/1/2013-9/30/2018 were performed. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated for predictors of ≥F3 fibrosis. Among patients with NAFLD/ ICD-9/10 codes, ≥F3 prevalence ranged from 4.35% - 6.90%, and F4 prevalence ranged from 2.52%- 3.67%. Increasing metabolic co-morbidities was associated with higher risk of ≥F3 fibrosis. Compared to  patients without metabolic co-morbidities,  with four concurrent metabolic co-morbidities had higher risk of ≥F3 (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.40-1.73, p<0.001). In summary, prevalence of  with advanced fibrosis among U.S. adults was as high as 6.90% and prevalence of  with cirrhosis was as high as 3.67%, representing 5.18 million and 2.75 million, respectively, when using an estimate of 75 million U.S. adults with NAFLD.

Using data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2015-2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38.2  fb^{-1}, reconstructed particles are clustered into two large jets of similar mass, each consistent with four-parton substructure. No statistically significant excess of data over the background prediction is observed in the distribution of average jet mass. Pair-produced squarks with dominant hadronic R-parity-violating decays into four quarks and with masses between 0.10 and 0.72 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Similarly, pair-produced gluinos that decay into five quarks are also excluded with masses between 0.10 and 1.41 TeV at 95% confidence level.

In this sense, this work aims to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on intestinal microbiota modulation, degree of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, inflammation, gut permeability, and body composition.This double-blind, randomized clinical trial will include adult outpatients with a diagnosis of  confirmed by biopsy with or without transient elastography. All patients will undergo a complete anamnesis to investigate their alcohol consumption, previous history, medications, nutritional assessment (dietary intake and body composition), sarcopenia, physical activity level and physical and functional capacity, cardiovascular risk, biochemical parameters for assessment of inflammatory status, lipid profile, hepatic function, gut permeability, and assessment of microbiota.

Ultrastructural mitochondrial lesions, altered mitochondrial dynamics, decreased activity of respiratory chain complexes, and impaired ability to synthesize adenosine triphosphate are observed in liver tissues from patients with alcohol-associated and non-associated liver diseases. Increased lipogenesis with decreased fatty acid β-oxidation leads to the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes, which, combined with increased levels of reactive oxygen species, contributes to insulin resistance in patients with steatohepatitis. Moreover, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species mediate metabolic pathway signaling; alterations in these pathways affect development and progression of chronic liver diseases. Mitochondrial stress and lesions promote cell death, liver fibrogenesis, inflammation, and the innate immune responses to viral infections. We review the involvement of mitochondrial processes in development of chronic liver diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty, alcohol-associated, and drug-associated liver diseases, as well as hepatitis  and C, and discuss how they might be targeted therapeutically.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.

Angiogenesis is initiated by the detachment of pericytes (PCs) from vessels in AT. This process is necessary for the development of AT in obesity. The detachment is caused by excessive platelet-derived growth factor  (PDGF-) derived from M1-macrophages (Mφ) infiltrating obese AT. On the other hand, AT of tamoxifen-induced systemic PDGF receptor-β knockout mice showed decreased detachment of PCs from vessels in obesity, thereby attenuating hypertrophy of AT mediated by neoangiogenesis, resulting in protection from the development of chronic AT inflammation and systemic insulin resistance. The selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibitor eplerenone (Ep) suppresses chronic inflammation in fat and the liver, improves glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibits body weight and fat mass gain in mice fed a high-fat diet. As a novel mechanism, Ep increases energy expenditure and suppresses fat accumulation, thereby controlling the polarity of visceral AT Mφ from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 dominant. In addition, Ep directly inhibits the activation of signals 1 and 2 of NLRP3-inflammasomes in Mφ, which is an inflammatory mechanism closely involved in the development of . Thus, we propose novel therapeutic approaches to . Inhibition of PDGF receptor-β signaling prevents AT hypertrophy by regulating AT angiogenesis, and MR inhibitors directly suppress chronic inflammation in the AT and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007588>Search for resonant production of second-generation sleptons with same-sign dimuon events in proton-proton collisions at .</a></h2><p>A search is presented for resonant production of second-generation sleptons (  ,  ) via the -parity-violating coupling  to quarks, in events with two same-sign muons and at least two jets in the final state. The smuon (muon sneutrino) is expected to decay into a muon and a neutralino (chargino), which will then decay into a second muon and at least two jets. The analysis is based on the 2016 data set of proton-proton collisions at  recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9  . No significant deviation is observed with respect to standard model expectations. Upper limits on cross sections, ranging from 0.24 to 730  , are derived in the context of two simplified models representing the dominant signal contributions leading to a same-sign muon pair. The cross section limits are translated into coupling limits for a modified constrained minimal supersymmetric model with  as the only nonzero -parity violating coupling.

The comparison of positive rate of anti-HEV-IgG between the same etiology CH and cirrhosis groups was as follows: chronic hepatitis  1.27% (10/790) versus hepatitis  virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis 4.21% (22/522) (OR, 3.04 [1.36-6.77]; P = 0.00); chronic alcoholic hepatitis 1.41% (1/71) versus alcoholic cirrhosis 9.40% (11/117) (OR, 8.00 [1.00-64.25]; P = 0.03); chronic autoimmune hepatitis 1.69% (1/59) versus autoimmune cirrhosis 13.33% (12/90) (OR, 13.11 [1.49-115.27]; P = 0.01); the differences above were statistically significant. And chronic hepatitis C 3.23% (1/31) versus hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis 10.81% (4/37) (OR, 4.40 [0.45-43.53]; P > 0.05); chronic  0.00% (0/30) versus -related cirrhosis 25.00% (1/4) (P > 0.05), the differences were not statistically significant. Anti-HEV-IgG positive rates were also compared among different types of CH groups and no significant difference was found. Likewise, anti-HEV-IgG positive rate was compared among different types of cirrhosis groups, showing that the positive rates of both alcoholic cirrhosis (9.40%) and autoimmune cirrhosis (13.33%) were significantly higher than that of HBV-related cirrhosis (4.21%) (P < 0.05).We observed that the cirrhosis patients had a significantly higher anti-HEV-IgG positive rate comparing with the CH patients, especially in those with HBV-related, alcohol-related, and autoimmune-related cirrhosis (after adjusted for age).

BAFF was also found to have a protective role in hepatic steatosis via down regulating the expression of steatogenesis genes and enhancing steatosis in hepatocytes through BAFF-R. However, the roles of BAFF during liver regeneration are not well defined. In this study, C57/B6 mice with 70% partial hepatectomy were used as a liver regeneration model. BAFF expression was determined by enzyme immunoassay, and anti-BAFF-neutralizing antibodies were administered to confirm the effects of BAFF on liver regeneration. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and florescence staining determined the expression of -cell CCL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10). The angiogenesis promoting capability was evaluated after the transfection of cells with siRNA targeting BCL10 expression, and the role of NF-κ was assessed. The results revealed that the BAFF and BCL10 levels were upregulated after partial hepatectomy. Treatment with anti-BAFF-neutralizing antibodies caused death in mice that were subjected to 70% partial hepatectomy within 72 h. In vitro, recombinant BAFF protein did not enhance hepatocyte proliferation; however, transfection with BCL10 siRNA arrested hepatocytes at the G2/M phase. Interestingly, conditioned medium from BAFF-treated hepatocytes enhanced angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation. Moreover, Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4), and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) proteins were upregulated by BAFF through BCL10/NF-κ signaling. In mice that were treated with anti-BAFF-neutralizing antibodies, the microvessel density (MVD) of the remaining liver tissues and liver regeneration were both reduced. Taken together, our study demonstrated that an increased expression of BAFF and activation of BCL10/NF-κ signaling were involved in hepatocyte-driven angiogenesis and survival during liver regeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30814908>Search for single production of vector-like quarks decaying to a top quark and a  boson in proton-proton collisions at .</a></h2><p>A search is presented for the single production of vector-like quarks in proton-proton collisions at  .

Since gastrointestinal cancers account for more than 40% of all cancer-related deaths, it is imperative to formulate effective strategies to control them.Basic drug discovery research Our research has revealed that the abnormal expression of regulators of chromosomal stability is a cause of cancers and identified an effective compound against cancers with chromosomal instability. We revealed the molecular mechanism of peritoneal dissemination of cancer cells via the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis to CAR-like cells and identified an MEK inhibitor effective against these tumors. Residual tumor cells after chemotherapy in colorectal cancer are LGR5-positive cancer stem cells and their ability to eliminate reactive oxygen species is elevated. The development of surgical procedures and devices In cases of gastric tube reconstruction for esophageal cancer, we determined the anastomotic line for evaluating the blood flow using ICG angiography and measuring the tissue O2 metabolism. We established a novel gastric reconstruction method (book-binding technique) for gastric cancer and a new rectal reconstruction method focusing on the intra-intestinal pressure resistance for rectal cancer. We established a novel tissue fusion method, which allows contact-free local heating and retains tissue viability with very little damage, and developed an understanding of the collagen-related processes that underpin laser-induced tissue fusion. Strategy to prevent carcinogenesis We succeeded in cleaving hepatitis  virus DNA integrated into the nucleus of hepatocytes using genome editing tools.

A numerically higher rate of the secondary end point of death from any cause was observed with aspirin than with placebo.From 2010 through 2014, we enrolled community-dwelling persons in Australia and the United States who were 70 years of age or older (or ≥65 years of age among blacks and Hispanics in the United States) and did not have cardiovascular disease, dementia, or disability. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo. Deaths were classified according to the underlying cause by adjudicators who were unaware of trial-group assignments. Hazard ratios were calculated to compare mortality between the aspirin group and the placebo group, and post hoc exploratory analyses of specific causes of death were performed.Of the 19,114 persons who were enrolled, 9525 were assigned to receive aspirin and 9589 to receive placebo. A total of 1052 deaths occurred during a median of 4.7 years of follow-up. The risk of death from any cause was 12.7 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 11.1 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.29). Cancer was the major contributor to the higher mortality in the aspirin group, accounting for 1.6 excess deaths per 1000 person-years. Cancer-related death occurred in 3.1% of the participants in the aspirin group and in 2.3% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.56).Higher all-cause mortality was observed among apparently healthy older adults who received daily aspirin than among those who received placebo and was attributed primarily to cancer-related death.

However, no drug with cyclophilin inhibition as the primary mode of action has advanced completely through clinical development to market. In this study, we present findings on the cyclophilin inhibitor, CRV431, that highlight its potential as a drug candidate for chronic liver diseases. CRV431 was found to potently inhibit all cyclophilin isoforms tested-A, , D, and G. Inhibitory constant or IC values ranged from 1 to 7 nM, which was up to 13 times more potent than the parent compound, cyclosporine A (CsA), from which CRV431 was derived. Other CRV431 advantages over CsA as a nontransplant drug candidate were significantly diminished immunosuppressive activity, less drug transporter inhibition, and reduced cytotoxicity potential. Oral dosing to mice and rats led to good blood exposures and a 5- to 15-fold accumulation of CRV431 in liver compared with blood concentrations across a wide range of CRV431 dosing levels. Most importantly, CRV431 decreased liver fibrosis in a 6-week carbon tetrachloride model and in a mouse model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Additionally, CRV431 administration during a late, oncogenic stage of the  disease model resulted in a 50% reduction in the number and size of liver tumors. These findings are consistent with CRV431 targeting fibrosis and cancer through multiple, cyclophilin-mediated mechanisms and support the development of CRV431 as a safe and effective drug candidate for liver diseases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cyclophilin inhibitors have demonstrated therapeutic activities in many disease models, but no drug candidates have yet advanced completely through development to market. In this study, CRV431 is shown to potently inhibit multiple cyclophilin isoforms, possess several optimized pharmacological properties, and decrease liver fibrosis and tumors in mouse models of chronic liver disease, which highlights its potential to be the first approved drug primarily targeting cyclophilin isomerases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30676649>Developmental Outcomes for Children at High Risk of Dyslexia and Children With Developmental Language Disorder.</a></h2><p>We followed children at family risk of dyslexia and children with preschool language difficulties from age 3½, comparing them with controls (N = 234). At age 8, children were classified as having dyslexia or Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) and compared at earlier time points with controls. Children with dyslexia have specific difficulties with phonology and emergent reading skills in the preschool period, whereas children with DLD, with or without dyslexia, show a wider range of impairments including significant problems with executive and motor tasks. For children with both dyslexia and DLD, difficulties with phonology are generally more severe than those observed in children with dyslexia or DLD alone. Findings confirm that poor phonology is the major cognitive risk factor for dyslexia.© 2019 The Authors.

Hepatic steatosis and serum level of liver enzymes, and tumor necrosis-α (TNF-α) significantly reduced in both groups (p < 0.05). None of the changes were significantly different between two groups.Our results indicated that curcumin supplementation plus lifestyle modification is not superior to lifestyle modification alone in amelioration of inflammation.IRCT20100524004010N24, this trial was retrospectively registered on May 14, 2018.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30978057>Combination of Searches for Higgs Boson Pair Production in Proton-Proton Collisions at sqrt[s]=13  TeV.</a></h2><p>This Letter describes a search for Higgs boson pair production using the combined results from four final states: bbγγ, bbττ, bbbb, and bbVV, where V represents a W or Z boson.

We hypothesized that kidney transplantation would decrease both GDF15 and N-terminal pro--type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and that GDF-15 decrease relates to post-kidney transplantation allograft function.End-stage kidney disease patients on dialysis awaiting a living donor kidney transplantation (n = 39), and those expected to be on the deceased donor waitlist for at least 12 months (n = 43) were enrolled at three transplant centers. Serum GDF15 and NT-proBNP were measured at 0, 3, and 12 months post-kidney transplantation or post-enrollment. Change in serum GDF15 and NT-proBNP concentrations, and their relation to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were assessed by non-parametric tests and regression analyses.Median baseline GDF15 was 4744 pg/ml and 5451 pg/ml for the kidney transplantation and dialysis groups, respectively (p = 0.09). Kidney transplantation resulted in a significant decrease in GDF15 (month 12 median 1631 pg/ml, p < 0.0001 vs. baseline), whereas there was no change for the dialysis group (month 12 median 5658 pg/ml, p = 0.31). Post-kidney transplantation NT-proBNP highly correlated with GDF15 (ρ = 0.64, p < 0.0001). GDF15 inversely correlated with post-transplant eGFR for the kidney transplantation group (ρ = -0.42, p = 0.0081). Month 12 NT-proBNP explained 15.8% and 40.1% of the variance in month 12 GDF15 in the dialysis and kidney transplantation groups, respectively. The relationship of GDF15 with eGFR was no longer significant when NT-proBNP was included in the models.Kidney transplantation significantly decreases serum GDF15 concentrations. The post-kidney transplantation association of GDF15 with NT-proBNP is consistent with a gradient of post- kidney transplantation cardiovascular risk.Copyright © 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Identifying mechanisms by which LV mass change and functional improvement occur in some end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients may help to appropriately target kidney transplant (KT) recipients for further investigation and intervention. The concentration of serum adiponectin, a cardiovascular biomarker, increases in cardiac failure, its production being enhanced by -type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and both serum adiponectin and BNP concentrations decline posttransplantation.We tested the hypothesis that kidney transplantation alters LV characteristics that relate to serum adiponectin concentrations.Prospective and observational cohort study.The study was performed at 3 adult kidney transplant and dialysis centers in Ontario, Canada.A total of 82 KT candidate subjects were recruited (39 to the KT group and 43 to the dialysis group). Predialysis patients were excluded.Subjects underwent CMR with a 1.5-tesla whole-body magnetic resonance scanner using a phased-array cardiac coil and retrospective vectorographic gating. LV mass, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), and LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) were measured by CMR pre-KT and again 12 months post-KT (N = 39), or 12 months later if still receiving dialysis (N = 43). LV mass, LVESV, and LVEDV were indexed for height (m) to calculate left ventricular mass index (LVMI), left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI), and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI), respectively. Serum total adiponectin and N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) concentrations were measured at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months.We performed a prospective 1:1 observational study comparing KT candidates with ESKD either receiving a living donor organ (KT group) or waiting for a deceased donor organ (dialysis group).Left ventricular mass index change was -1.98 ± 5.5 and -0.36 ± 5.7 g/m for KT versus dialysis subjects ( = .44). Left ventricular mass change was associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) ( = .0008) and average LV mass ( = .0001). Left ventricular ejection fraction did not improve (2.9 ± 6.6 vs 0.7 ± 4.9 %,  = .09), while LVESVI and LVEDVI decreased more post-KT than with continued dialysis (-3.36 ± 5.6 vs -0.22 ± 4.4 mL/m,  < .01 and -4.9 ± 8.5 vs -0.3 ± 9.2 mL/m,  = .02). Both adiponectin (-7.1 ± 11.3 vs -0.11 ± 7.9 µg/mL,  < .0001) and NT-proBNP (-3811 ± 8130 vs 1665 ± 20013 pg/mL,  < .0001) declined post-KT. Post-KT adiponectin correlated with NT-proBNP ( = .001), but not estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ( = .13). Change in adiponectin did not correlate with change in LVEF in the KT group (Spearman ρ = 0.16,  = .31) or dialysis group (Spearman ρ = 0.19,  = .21).Few biomarkers of cardiac function were measured to fully contextualize their role during changing kidney function. Limited intrapatient biomarker sampling and CMR measurements precluded constructing dose-response curves of biomarkers to LV mass and function. The CMR timing in relation to dialysis was not standardized.The LVESVI and LVEDVI but not LVMI or LVEF improve post-KT. LVMI and LVEF change is independent of renal function and adiponectin. As adiponectin correlates with NT-proBNP post-KT, improved renal function through KT restores the normal heart-endocrine axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233751>Zoledronic acid prevents the hepatic changes associated with high fat diet in rats; the potential role of mevalonic acid pathway in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>The role of hepatic free cholesterol (FC) in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is raised up and the intervention with cholesterol synthesis will be a potential therapeutic target. This study investigated the hepatoprotective effect of mevalonic acid pathway inhibition by Zoledronic acid (ZA) on the hepatic changes associated with high fat diet (HFD) in rats.Thirty two male Wistar rats were used. They were divided into 2 groups: (I) control naïve (II) : induced by HFD for 12 weeks, this group is subdivided into (A)  untreated () + ZA (50ug/kg/week) i.p. for 12 weeks (C)  + ZA (100μg/kg/week) i.p. for 12 weeks. Portal pressure (PP), liver enzymes AST and ALT, serum glucose, lipid profile, hepatic levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), FC and triglyceride (TG), histopathological changes and expression of both hepatic alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and Caspase-3 were measured. ZA significantly prevented portal hypertension, worsening in liver function, and dyslipidemia. The hepatic levels of TNF-α, VEGF, FC and TG were significantly decreased in comparison to  untreated group. ZA hindered the histopathological changes induced by HFD. ZA inhibited the expression of hepatic α-SMA and Caspase-3 with significant difference favor the high dose intervention. ZA in a dose related manner prevents the hepatic pathological effects of chronic HFD ingestion in rats. This may be largely mediated by its ability to reduce TNF-α and hepatic FC.Copyright © 2019.

Hydrogen sulfide (H S) may exert anti-calcific actions. Here we investigated H S as an inhibitor of valvular calcification and to identify its targets in the pathogenesis.Effects of H S on osteoblastic transdifferentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VIC) isolated from samples of human aortic valves were studied using immunohistochemistry and western blots. We also assessed H2S on valvular calcification in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE ) mice.In human VIC, H S from donor compounds (, Na S, GYY4137, AP67, and AP72) inhibited mineralization/osteoblastic transdifferentiation, dose-dependently in response to phosphate. Accumulation of calcium in the extracellular matrix and expression of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase was also inhibited. RUNX2 was not translocated to the nucleus and phosphate uptake was decreased. Pyrophosphate generation was increased via up-regulating ENPP2 and ANK1. Lowering endogenous production of H S by concomitant silencing of cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) favoured VIC calcification. analysis of human specimens revealed higher Expression of CSE in aorta stenosis valves with calcification (AS) was higher than in valves of aortic insufficiency (AI). In contrast, tissue H S generation was lower in AS valves compared to AI valves. Valvular calcification in ApoE mice on a high-fat diet was inhibited by H S.The endogenous CSE-CBS/H S system exerts anti-calcification effects in heart valves providing a novel therapeutic approach to prevent hardening of valves.© 2019 The Authors.

During the experiments, 1 mg/kg LBP was intragastrically fed on a daily basis with or without MCD diet lasting from the 4th to 6th week. Control and vehicle-control (LBP + PBS) were fed with a regular animal chow. LBP significantly ameliorated -induced injuries, including the increase of serum ALT and AST levels, hepatic oxidative stress, fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis. The hepatoprotective effects of LBP were accompanied by the attenuation of thioredoxin interacting protein, nod-like receptor protein 3/6 (NLRP3/6) and reduced NF-κ (nuclear factor-kappa ) activity. Vehicle LBP fed mice showed no adverse effect on the liver. In conclusion, the suppression of the NLRP3/6 inflammasome pathway and NF-κ activation may partly contribute to the reduction of the hepatic injury during the progression of  by therapeutic LBP treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

OBI has been associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the incidence of OBI in patients with HCC and other liver diseases. We also investigated whether, in patients with OBI and HCC, HBV DNA has integrated into the DNA of hepatocytes.We collected clinical information and liver tissues from 110 HBsAg-negative patients (90 with HCC and 20 without HCC; median ages at surgical resection and biopsy collection, 64.1 and 48.6 years, respectively) who underwent liver resection or liver biopsy from November 2002 through July 2017 in Hong Kong. HBV DNA and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) were analyzed and quantified by PCR in liver tissues. Integration of HBV DNA into the DNA of liver cells was detected by Alu-PCR.Of the 90 HBsAg-negative patients with HCC, 18 had alcoholic liver disease (20%), 14 had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or steatohepatitis (16%), 2 had primary biliary cholangitis, 2 had recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, 1 had autoimmune hepatitis, and 53 had none of these (59%). Among the 20 patients without HCC, 7 had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or steatohepatitis, 7 had primary biliary cholangitis, and 6 had autoimmune hepatitis. OBI was detected in 62/90 patients with HCC (69%) and 3/20 patients without HCC (15%) (P < .0001). cccDNA was detectable in liver cells of 29 patients with HCC and OBI (47%) and HBV DNA had integrated into DNA of liver cells of 43 patients with HCC and OBI (69%); cccDNA and integrated HBV DNA were not detected in the 3 patients who had OBI without HCC. There were 29 patients with integration of HBV DNA among 33 patients with undetectable cccDNA in liver tissues (88%) and 14 patients with integration of HBV DNA among the 29 patients with cccDNA in liver tissues (48%) (P = .001). HBV DNA was found to integrate near genes associated with hepatocarcinogenesis, such as those encoding telomerase reverse transcriptase, lysine methyltransferase 2B, and cyclin A2. Among the 43 patients with integration of HBV DNA, 39 (91%) did not have cirrhosis.In an analysis of clinical data and liver tissues from 90 HBsAg-negative patients with HCC, we found that almost 70% had OBI, of whom 70% had integration of HBV DNA into liver cell DNA; 90% of these patients did not have cirrhosis. HBV DNA integrated near hepatic oncogenes; these integrations might promote development of liver cancer.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We investigated reliable contraceptive use at baseline and six months in key-populations in Uganda, during two Simulated HIV Vaccine Efficacy trials (SiVETs). SiVETs were nested within observational cohorts of Fisherfolk (2012-2014) and Female sex workers (2014-2017). Women in the observational cohorts were screened and enrolled into the SiVET. The trial administered a licensed Hepatitis  vaccine at 0, 1 and 6 months. Contraceptive use data were recorded at baseline and follow-up clinic visits. Reliable contraceptives (injectable Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA), implant, pills, and intrauterine device (IUD)) were promoted and provided to women not using a reliable method at enrolment. Overall, 367 women were enrolled. At baseline 203 (55%) reported use of reliable contraceptive. Of the 164 women not using a reliable method at enrolment, 131 (80%) started using them during follow-up bringing the overall number to 334 (91%) at the end of follow-up. Young age (≤35 years) was an independent predictor of reliable contraceptive use at both time points while other factors varied.

It was first identified for its growth factor-like properties, being implicated in tissue remodeling, development, inflammation, and protein homeostasis. However, these findings are controversial, and the role of PGRN in liver disease remains unknown. In the current study, we examined the effect of PGRN in two different models of chronic liver disease, methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCD)-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis. To induce long-term expression of PGRN, PGRN-expressing adenovirus was delivered via injection into the tibialis anterior. In the CCl4-induced fibrosis model, PGRN showed protective effects against hepatic injury, inflammation, and fibrosis via inhibition of nuclear transcription factor kappa  (NF-κ) phosphorylation. PGRN also decreased lipid accumulation and inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production and fibrosis in the MCD-induced  model. In vitro treatment of primary macrophages and Raw 264.7 cells with conditioned media from hepatocytes pre-treated with PGRN prior to stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or palmitate decreased their expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, PGRN suppressed inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression in a cell culture model of hepatocyte injury and primary stellate cell activation. These observations increase our understanding of the role of PGRN in liver injury and suggest PGRN delivery as a potential therapeutic strategy in chronic inflammatory liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021310>Mindfulness Meditation and Anxiety in Adolescents on an Inpatient Psychiatric Unit.</a></h2><p>This study presents the impact of chaplain-provided mindfulness meditation (MM) groups on state-anxiety in adolescent inpatients on an acute psychiatric unit, an understudied topic that warrants further research given that anxiety is a demonstrated predictor of suicide attempts in adolescents and the elevated suicide risk of this population. A total of 53 adolescent patients, age 13-19, attended optional 30-minute MM groups while hospitalized for inpatient psychiatric care. State-anxiety was assessed immediately before and after each MM session, and psychiatric symptom severity upon admission was compared between patients choosing to attend MM and those who did not. State-anxiety was found to decrease significantly between pre- and post-MM upon first exposure regardless of patient age, sex, and prior experience with MM. Findings also suggest the possibility that patients experiencing symptoms of psychosis may benefit more from MM as compared to other patients. Admission symptom severity was not found to be an indicator of MM attendance. These findings suggest the possibility that MM could be an effective and relatively immediate transdiagnostic intervention to lower state anxiety in adolescents on an inpatient psychiatric unit and invite further implementation and research by staff chaplains on such units.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30252084>Deployment Among Active-Duty Military Women and Pregnancy-Related Hypertensive Disorders.</a></h2><p>Today women comprise 15% of the U.S. active-duty military, but are often overlooked in research of the Armed Forces. While some of the challenges faced by women are similar to men, they encounter unique stressors, including pregnancy-related issues. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) affect 5-10% of pregnancies annually and have been linked to maternal stress, but no studies have assessed the impact of maternal military deployment on HDP incidence. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to quantify the risk of HDP among active-duty U.S. military mothers who deployed in the post-9/11/2001 era.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a U.S. Department of Defense database comprised of all active-duty women who gave birth to their first, live-born singleton infant using Tricare from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008. The database included records for maternal/infant birth hospitalizations and deployment. HDP was defined with ICD-9-CM codes in the maternal birth hospitalization record. We evaluated the risk of HDP associated with several deployment measures for the cohort overall and among racial/ethnic groups: (1) deployment in general (yes vs. no); (2) timing of deployment ending prior to birth (<12 months or ≥12 months prior vs. non-deployed); and, (3) cumulative time spent deployed since 9/11/2001. We used multivariable logistic regression and reported odds-ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We also explored meaningful categorization of certain continuous deployment measures associated with HDP incidence. The study was approved by the University of South Florida Institutional Review Board.There were a total of 36,667 births and 13.4% of mothers experienced at least one HDP. No increased risk of HDP was observed for deployed mothers compared with non-deployed mothers in the complete cohort (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.95-1.09), but cumulative deployment length ≥1 year was identified as a potential risk factor for HDP vs. <1 year deployment (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00-1.36).Our study was the first to quantify the incidence of HDP among active-duty military women giving birth to their first child. It was slightly higher than in the general population, but deployment overall is seemingly not responsible for the elevated incidence.© Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2018.

The majority of these are in non-coding regions, and are commonly assigned to the nearest gene along the genome. However, this approach neglects the three-dimensional organisation of the genome, and the fact that the genome contains arrays of extremely conserved non-coding elements termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), which can be utilized to detect genes under long-range developmental regulation. Here we review a GRB-based approach to assign loci in non-coding regions to potential target genes, and apply it to reanalyse the results of one of the largest schizophrenia GWAS (SWG PGC, 2014). We further apply this approach to GWAS data from two related neuropsychiatric disorders-autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder-to show that it is applicable to developmental disorders in general. We find that disease-associated SNPs are overrepresented in GRBs and that the GRB model is a powerful tool for linking these SNPs to their correct target genes under long-range regulation. Our analysis identifies novel genes not previously implicated in schizophrenia and corroborates a number of predicted targets from the original study. The results are available as an online resource in which the genomic context and the strength of enhancer-promoter associations can be browsed for each schizophrenia-associated SNP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30556091>Optimal liver stiffness measurement values for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic liver disease in Singapore.</a></h2><p>Despite the widespread use of transient elastography for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis, the optimal cut-off liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values remain unclear. This study aimed to validate the optimal cut-off LSM values for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD).Prospective multicentre data of CLD patients who underwent paired liver biopsy and LSM was analysed to determine the optimal cut-off LSM values for predicting significant fibrosis (METAVIR F ≥ 2) and cirrhosis (METAVIR F4). A high-quality cohort was selected by excluding those with failed LSM and invalid LSM readings.Of the 481 patients recruited, 322 fulfilled the pre-defined quality criteria. CLD aetiology was chronic hepatitis  (CHB) in 49%, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () in 16% and chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in 12%. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for LSM was 0.775 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.724-0.826) for significant fibrosis and 0.810 (95% CI 0.738-0.882) for cirrhosis. Optimal cut-off LSM values were 9 kPa for significant fibrosis and 13 kPa for cirrhosis in the general cohort. Optimal cut-off LSM values were 9 kPa for significant fibrosis and 12 kPa for cirrhosis for both CHB and CHC, while the corresponding values for  were 11 kPa and 15 kPa.Optimal cut-off LSM values should be selected based on disease aetiology. In Singapore, the optimal cut-off LSM values for CHB and CHC are 9 kPa for significant fibrosis and 12 kPa for cirrhosis. Optimal cut-off values for  require further validation.Copyright: © Singapore Medical Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30327962>Comparison of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients with Cryptogenic Versus Hepatitis  Etiology: A Study of 1079 Cases Over 3 Decades.</a></h2><p>Traditionally in Asia, hepatitis  (HBV) accounts for the majority of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but increasingly, non-viral or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () etiology may play a more prominent role with current socioeconomic changes. There remains a paucity in data comparing -HCC to HBV-related HCC. In this study, we explored the differences in clinical characteristics between HBV- and cryptogenic-related HCC.Patients with HCC seen in the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Singapore General Hospital were enrolled in an ongoing database since 1980. Patients with HCC attributed to HBV or cryptogenic etiology were identified. Comparison of clinical characteristics was performed between the two groups.There were 916 HBV-HCC patients and 163 cryptogenic HCC patients, accounting for 70.9% and 12.6% of the total HCC cases (1292 patients), respectively. Out of the total cohort enrolled from 1980 to 2005, the ratio of cryptogenic to HBV patients was 1:6.7, while from 2006 to the current year, the ratio of cryptogenic to HBV patients has increased significantly to 1:3.9. Relative to patients with HBV, cryptogenic HCC patients were older (67.6 vs. 59.4 years old; p < 0.001), had lower proportion of male patients (69.9% vs. 83.8%; p < 0.001), and had higher incidence of smoking (32.2% vs. 25.8%; p = 0.008). HBV group had higher alanine transaminase (60.9 ± 85.7 U/L vs. 48.0 ± 52.1 U/L; p = 0.003), hemoglobin (12.7 ± 2.28 g/dL vs. 12.0 ± 2.46 g/dL, p < 0.001), albumin (32.9 ± 6.8 g/L vs. 31.3 ± 7.7 g/L; p = 0.007), and prothrombin time (13.2 ± 2.95 s vs. 12.7 ± 2.01 s, p = 0.023), as compared to the cryptogenic group. Cryptogenic HCC patients presented more frequently with unifocal HCC (55.2% vs. 46.5%; p = 0.002). There was no difference in the proportions of patients receiving surgical resection in both groups (23.5% in HBV group vs. 17.9% in cryptogenic group; p = 0.202). Cox regression analysis revealed no survival difference between cryptogenic-related HCC and HBV-related HCC (p = 0.367).Temporal trends suggest that HCC attributed to HBV is on the decline, while cryptogenic- or -related HCC is an emerging clinical entity. A paradigm shift in approach to screening, surveillance, and management of HCC may be required in view of the changing landscape of HCC epidemiology into an increasing non-viral etiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30420265>Managing diabetes and liver disease association.</a></h2><p>There is strong association between liver diseases and diabetes (DM) which is higher than expected by a chance association of two very common disorders. It can be classified into three categories: Liver disease related to diabetes, hepatogenous diabetes (HD), and liver disease occurring coincidentally with DM. The criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes associating liver disease are the same for primary diabetes. Two hours post glucose load is a better screening test for HD. HbA1c may not be suitable for diagnosis or monitoring of diabetes associating advanced liver disease. Apart from the increased cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 DM (T2 DM) and NAFLD, the cardiovascular and retinopathy risk is low in HD. Patients with metabolic derangement should be screened for NAFLD which in turn may predict T2 DM development. Similarly, patients with established T2 DM should also be screened for NAFLD which further contributes to diabetes worsening. Diabetes is a significant risk factor for progression of the chronic liver disease. It is associated with poor patient survival. Treatment of diabetes associating liver disease appears beneficial. Metformin, if tolerated and not contraindicated, is recommended as a first-line therapy for patients with diabetes and chronic liver disease (CLD). If the hepatic disease is severe, insulin secretagogues should be avoided because of the increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Pioglitazone may be useful in patients with fatty liver disease. DPP-4 inhibitors showed effectiveness and safety for the treatment of T2 DM in CLD patients up to those with child  stage. GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors exhibit positive effects on weight and are associated with minimal risk of hypoglycaemia. Insulin must be used with caution, as hypoglycaemia may be a problem. Insulin analogues are preferred in the context of hypoglycaemia Statins can be used to treat dyslipidaemia in NAFLD, also the use of angiotensin II receptor antagonist for hypertension is safe and beneficial Given the clear association between diabetes mellitus and hepatocellular carcinoma, the strict control of glycaemia with insulin sensitizers can be essential in its prevention. The addition of DM to the currently used scores (Child-Pugh and MELD scores) may enhance the sensitivity and the specificity for prediction of morbidity and mortality rates in cirrhotic patients. In the new era of directly acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for HCV treatment, it is recommended to follow up lipid profile and blood sugar levels following SVR in order to adjust doses of medications used in diabetic (SVR is associated with reduction in insulin requirements) and dyslipidaemic patients (rebound increase in the lipid profile after clearing the virus may increase risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)). The issues of post liver transplant diabetes and relation between DM and chronic HBV are highlighted. This narrative review and Consensus-based practice guidance (under revision and criticism) are based on a formal review and analysis of the recently published world literature on the topic (Medline search up to September 2017); and the experience of the authors and independent reviewers.Copyright © 2018 Pan-Arab Association of Gastroenterology.

Increasing numbers of studies have shown that silybin can improve nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () in animal models and patients; however, the mechanisms underlying silybin's actions remain unclear.Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet for 8 weeks to induce the  model, and silybin was orally administered to the  mice. The effects of silybin on lipid accumulation, hepatic fibrosis, oxidative stress, inflammation-related gene expression and nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) activities were evaluated by biochemical analysis, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time PCR and western blot.Silybin treatment significantly alleviated hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation in MCD-induced  mice. Moreover, silybin inhibited HSC activation and hepatic apoptosis and prevented the formation of MDBs in the  liver. Additionally, silybin partly reversed the abnormal expression of lipid metabolism-related genes in . Further study showed that the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway played important roles in the silybin-derived antioxidant effect, as evidenced by the upregulation of Nrf2 target genes in the silybin treatment group. In addition, silybin significantly downregulated the expression of inflammation-related genes and suppressed the activity of NF-κ signaling.Silybin was effective in preventing the MCD-induced increases in hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation. The effect was related to alteration of lipid metabolism-related gene expression, activation of the Nrf2 pathway and inhibition of the NF-κ signaling pathway in the  liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30141647>Constraining Gluon Distributions in Nuclei Using Dijets in Proton-Proton and Proton-Lead Collisions at sqrt[s_{NN}]=5.02  TeV.</a></h2><p>The pseudorapidity distributions of dijets as functions of their average transverse momentum (p_{T}^{ave}) are measured in proton-lead (pPb) and proton-proton (pp) collisions.

A significant modification of the pPb spectra with respect to the pp spectra is observed in all p_{T}^{ave} intervals investigated. The ratios of the pPb and pp distributions are compared to next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations with unbound nucleon and nuclear parton distribution functions (PDFs).

A complex retrovirus, mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), requires replication in  and T lymphocytes for mammary gland transmission and is antagonized by the innate immune restriction factor murine Apobec3 (mA3). To determine whether the regulatory/accessory protein Rem affects innate responses to MMTV, a splice-donor mutant (MMTV-SD) lacking Rem expression was injected into BALB/c mice. Mammary tumors induced by MMTV-SD had a lower proviral load, lower incidence, and longer latency than mammary tumors induced by wild-type MMTV (MMTV-WT). MMTV-SD proviruses had many G-to-A mutations on the proviral plus strand, but also C-to-T transitions within WRC motifs. Similarly, a lymphomagenic MMTV variant lacking Rem expression showed decreased proviral loads and increased WRC motif mutations relative to those in wild-type-virus-induced tumors, consistent with activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mutagenesis in lymphoid cells. These mutations are typical of the Apobec family member AID, a -cell-specific mutagenic protein involved in antibody variable region hypermutation. In contrast, mutations in WRC motifs and proviral loads were similar in MMTV-WT and MMTV-SD proviruses from tumors in AID-insufficient mice. AID was not packaged in MMTV virions. Rem coexpression in transfection experiments led to AID proteasomal degradation. Our data suggest that  specifies a human-pathogenic immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif-like protein that inhibits AID and antagonizes innate immunity during MMTV replication in lymphocytes. Complex retroviruses, such as human-pathogenic immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), cause many human deaths. These retroviruses produce lifelong infections through viral proteins that interfere with host immunity. The complex retrovirus mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) allows for studies of host-pathogen interactions not possible in humans. A mutation preventing expression of the MMTV Rem protein in two different MMTV strains decreased proviral loads in tumors and increased viral genome mutations typical of an evolutionarily ancient enzyme, AID. Although the presence of AID generally improves antibody-based immunity, it may contribute to human cancer progression. We observed that coexpression of MMTV Rem and AID led to AID destruction. Our results suggest that Rem is the first known protein inhibitor of AID and that further experiments could lead to new disease treatments.Copyright © 2019 Singh et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30932612>Search for Narrow Hγ Resonances in Proton-Proton Collisions at sqrt[s]=13  TeV.</a></h2><p>A search for heavy, narrow resonances decaying to a Higgs boson and a photon (Hγ) has been performed in proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9  fb^{-1} collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. Events containing a photon and a Lorentz-boosted hadronically decaying Higgs boson reconstructed as a single, large-radius jet are considered, and the γ+jet invariant mass spectrum is analyzed for the presence of narrow resonances. To increase the sensitivity of the search, events are categorized depending on whether or not the large-radius jet can be identified as a result of the merging of two jets originating from  quarks.

Transient elastography is gaining popularity as a means of non-invasively determining both liver stiffness (fibrosis level) and degree of fatty infiltration, expressed as controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) value.  The aims of this study were to investigate the association between IR and level of fatty liver, and to identify the group at a greater risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis using transient elastography and other noninvasive fibrosis markers. A total of 169 patients without chronic hepatitis  and C were analyzed.  The CAP value was significantly associated with IR (HOMA-IR ≥2.5; AUROC = 0.81), and the optimal cut-off to discriminate IR was 264 dB/m. The liver stiffness measurement and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index values were significantly higher for CAP ≥264 than in CAP <264. The 9 patients among the overall 169 patients (5.3%) and among the 102 NAFLD patients (8.8%) who showed ≥264 dB and ≥7.0 kPa in transient elastography could represent good candidates for liver biopsy.  Evaluation of NAFLD based on CAP values was useful in diagnosing IR.

Recently, NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome functions in impairing endothelial barrier function. In this study, we test the hypothesis that TXNIP-NLRP3 axis repression prevents against intestinal barrier function disruption in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). First, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced alterations in expression of ZO-1 and occludin, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) isolated from C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and TXNIP mice were evaluated. The underlying regulatory mechanisms of TXNIP knockout in vivo were investigated with the detection of expressions of TXNIP, NLRP3 and ZO-1, and occludin, the interaction of TXNIP-NLRP3, MPO activity, ROS level, permeability of intestinal mucosa, levels of inflammatory factors in serum, and LPS concentration. We identified that TXNIP knockout promoted ZO-1 and occludin expression, yet reduced MPO activity, ROS level, and cell permeability in IECs, indicating restored the intestinal barrier function. However, LPS upregulated TXNIP and NLRP3 expression, as well as contributed to the interaction between TXNIP and NLRP3 in vitro. Furthermore, TXNIP was significantly upregulated in the intestinal mucosa of  mice and its knockout repaired the intestinal barrier disrupt, inhibited expression of inflammatory factors, and reduced LPS concentration as well as hepatic injury in vivo. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that inhibited the activation of the TXNIP-NLRP3 axis reduced MPO activity and oxidative stress and thus restoring the intestinal barrier function in . TXNIP-NLRP3 axis may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the  treatment.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30732555>Mechanisms of beneficial effects of exercise training on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Roles of oxidative stress and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disorder which is associated with accumulation of fats in the liver. It causes a wide variety of pathological effects such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and cirrhosis, insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The molecular mechanisms that cause the initiation and progression of NAFLD are not fully understood. Oxidative stress (OS) induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation are likely a significant mechanism which can lead to hepatic cell death and tissue injury. Mitochondrial abnormalities, down-regulation of several antioxidant enzymes, glutathione (GSH) depletion and decreased activity of GSH-dependent antioxidants, accumulation of leukocytes and hepatic inflammation are the major sources of ROS overproduction in NAFLD. Excessive production of ROS suppresses the capacity of other antioxidant defence systems in NAFLD and causes further oxidative damage. Regular exercise can be considered as an effective strategy for treatment of NAFLD. It improves NAFLD by reducing intrahepatic fat content, increasing β-oxidation of fatty acids, inducing hepato-protective autophagy, overexpressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- γ (PPAR-γ), as well as attenuating hepatocyte apoptosis and increasing insulin sensitivity. Exercise training also suppresses ROS overproduction and OS in NAFLD via up-regulation of several antioxidant enzymes and anti-inflammatory mediators. Therefore, an understanding of these molecules and signalling pathways gives us valuable information about NAFLD progression and a method for developing a suitable clinical treatment. This review aimed to evaluate sources of ROS and OS in NAFLD and the molecular mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of exercises on NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30710864>Hepatitis  and C virus infection as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease in Israel-A nationwide cohort study.</a></h2><p>To study the association between hepatitis C and  viruses and Parkinson's disease (PD) in Israel.A retrospective cohort study was performed by analyzing the computerized database of Clalit Healthcare Service in Israel.

It is now recognised that this subfamily is composed of three genera with 33 species, seven of them described since 2002. Here, we describe a new species of titi, Plecturocebus, from the municipality of Alta Floresta, Mato Grosso, Brazil. We adopt an integrative taxonomic approach that includes phylogenomic analyses, pelage characters, and locality records. A reduced representation genome-wide approach was employed to assess phylogenetic relationships among species of the eastern Amazonian clade of the Plecturocebus moloch group. Using existing records, we calculated the Extent of Occurrence (EOO) of the new species and estimated future habitat loss for the region based on predictive models. We then evaluated the species' conservation status using the IUCN Red list categories and criteria. The new species presents a unique combination of morphological characters: (1) grey agouti colouration on the crown and dorsal parts; (2) entirely bright red-brown venter; (3) an almost entirely black tail with a pale tip; and (4) light yellow colouration of the hair on the cheeks contrasting with bright red-brown hair on the sides of the face. Our phylogenetic reconstructions based on maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods revealed well-supported species relationships, with the Alta Floresta taxon as sister to P. moloch + P. vieirai. The species EOO is 10,166,653 ha and we predict a total habitat loss of 86% of its original forest habitat under a "business as usual" scenario in the next 24 years, making the newly discovered titi monkey a Critically Endangered species under the IUCN A3c criterion. We give the new titi monkey a specific epithet based on: (1) clear monophyly of this lineage revealed by robust genomic and mitochondrial data; (2) distinct and diagnosable pelage morphology; and (3) a well-defined geographical distribution with clear separation from other closely related taxa.

The patients after randomization were divided into two groups: the main group followed the fast weight loss method; the control group received conventional drug treatment. The fast weight loss method included calorie restriction, salt intake, walking and sexual self-restraint. The conventional drug therapy included vitamin E, orlistat, pioglitazone hydrochloride, atorvastatin, lisinopril, benzodiazepines and anti-inflammatory agents. Primary endpoints were: ultrasound and histology suggestive of steatohepatitis, hepatic enzymes, weight loss, 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test and glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c). Secondary endpoints were: blood pressure and lipids.A total of 83% patients completed the study. In the main group weight lost was 7-16 kg (10-20% from baseline) for 8-10 weeks. In this group weight was lost due to reduction of fat mass only. The main vs. control group showed higher decrease in fat mass from baseline (p < .001). Ultrasound imaging and liver histological scoring system evidenced significant improvement in liver steatosis/fibrosis in the main group (p < .001). In the main vs. control group weight lost at 24 weeks led to positive laboratory changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), HbA1c, Homeostasis Model Assessment insulin resistance indexes (HOMA-IR), blood pressure (BP), cholesterol, triglycerides, bilirubin total and blood hemoglobin (p = .01). The fast weight loss in the patients adequately led to decrease in symptomatic drugs up to complete abolition.The study showed benefits of the fast weight loss method improving in steatosis/fibrosis and biochemical/metabolic outcomes in patients with severe  and T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595532>Chronic hepatitis  and : Is "fat" all bad?</a></h2><p>We read with interest the recent paper by Choi et al on the impact of biopsy-proven  on CHB outcomes.

We examined whether curcumin supplementation could be used in both prevention and treatment of  with fibrosis. Female Wistar rats were provided ad libitum access to a "western diet" (WD) high in fat (43% kcal), sucrose (29% kcal), and cholesterol (2% w/v), as well as 15% fructose drinking water. Intraperitoneal CC1 injections (0.5 mL/kg) were also administered at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6 to accelerate development of a  with fibrosis phenotype. Rats were randomized to four groups (n = 9-12/group) and fed ad libitum: (1) WD for 8-weeks (8WD), (2) WD enriched with curcumin for 8-weeks (8WD+C; 0.2% curcumin, BCM-95, DolCas Biotech) to assess prevention, (3) WD for 12-weeks (12WD), (4) WD for 8-weeks followed by 4-weeks WD+C (12WD+C) to assess treatment. Curcumin prevention (8WD vs. 8WD+C) attenuated (P < 0.05) histological liver inflammation, molecular markers of fibrosis (Col1a1 mRNA) and a serum marker of liver injury (AST). Curcumin treatment (12WD vs. 12WD+C) reduced (P < 0.05) hepatocellular inflammation, steatosis, NAFLD Activity Scores, and serum markers of liver injury (AST, ALP). Moreover, curcumin treatment also increased hepatic pACC/ACC, ApoB100, and SOD1 protein, and decreased hepatic FGF-21 levels; whereas, curcumin prevention increased hepatic glutathione levels. Both curcumin prevention and treatment reduced molecular markers of hepatic fibrosis (Col1a1 mRNA) and inflammation (TNF-α, SPP1 mRNA). Curcumin supplementation beneficially altered the  phenotype in female Wistar rats, particularly the reversal of hepatocellular inflammation.© 2018 The Authors.

Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was derived from the linear exponential DWI model. Mean diffusion (MD) and mean kurtosis (MK) were derived from the quadratic exponential model of DKI. Correlations between MR parameters and hepatic pathology determined by the NAFLD activity scoring system were analyzed by Spearman rank correlation analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were applied to determine the cutoff values of MD, MK as well as ADC in distinguishing  from non-. The diagnostic efficacies of MD and MK in detecting  were compared with that of ADC.Values for ADC and MD significantly decreased as the severity of NAFLD increased (ρ = -0.529, -0.904, respectively; P < 0.05). MK values significantly increased as the severity of NAFLD increased (ρ = 0.761; P < 0.05).

However, the observed HIV incidence may differ in participants who enroll into a trial. We used simulated vaccine efficacy trials (SiVET) nested within observational cohorts in these populations to evaluate this difference.SiVETs were nested in two observational cohorts (Jul 2012-Apr 2014 in FF and Aug 2014-Apr 2017 in FSW). From Jan 2012 all observational cohort participants (aged 18-49 years) presenting for quarterly visits were screened for enrolment into SiVETs, until 572 were enrolled. Those not enrolled (screened-out or not screened) in SiVET continued participation in the observational cohorts. In addition to procedures in the observational cohorts (HIV testing & risk assessment), SiVET participants were given a licensed Hepatitis  vaccine mimicking a schedule of a possible HIV vaccine, and followed-up for 12 months.In total, 3989 participants were enrolled into observational cohorts (1575 FF prior to Jul 2012 and 2414 FSW prior to Aug 2014). Of these 3622 (90.8%) returned at least once, 672 (44.1%) were screened and 572 enrolled in the SiVETs. HIV incidence pre SIVETs was 4.5/100 person years-at-risk (pyar), 95%CI (3.8-5.5). HIV incidence in SiVET was 3.5/100 pyar, (2.2-5.6) and higher in those not enrolled in the SiVET, 5.9/100 pyar, (4.3-8.1). This difference was greatest among FF. In the 12 months post-SIVET period (FF, May 2014-Apr 2015 and FSW, May 2017-Apr 2018), the HIV incidence was 3.7/100 pyar, (2.5-5.8).HIV incidence was lower in SiVET participants compared to non-SiVET. This difference was different for the two populations. Researchers designing HIV efficacy trials using observational cohort data need to consider the potential for lower than expected HIV incidence following screening and enrolment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions at sqrt[s]=13  TeV and recorded by the CMS experiment in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9  fb^{-1}. Events are selected by requiring the presence of a muon (μ), a photon (γ), an imbalance in transverse momentum from an undetected neutrino (ν), and at least two jets (j) of which exactly one is identified as associated with the hadronization of a  quark. A multivariate discriminant based on topological and kinematic event properties is employed to separate signal from background processes. An excess above the background-only hypothesis is observed, with a significance of 4.4 standard deviations. A fiducial cross section is measured for isolated photons with transverse momentum greater than 25 GeV in the central region of the detector. The measured product of the cross section and branching fraction is σ(pp→tγj)(t→μν)=115±17(stat)±30(syst)  fb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081822>An Advanced Murine Model for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Association with Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance, contributing to an increasing prevalence of chronic metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Recent research has established that pro-inflammatory immune cells infiltrate obese hypertrophic adipose tissue and liver. Given the emerging importance of immune cells in the context of metabolic homeostasis, there is a critical need to quantify and characterize their modification during the development of type 2 diabetes and . However, animal models that induce pathophysiological features typical of human  are sparse.

We demonstrate the handling of mice in non-SPF conditions, digestion of the tissues and identification of macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells,  and T cell subsets by flow cytometry. Representative flow cytometry plots from SPF HFD mice and non-SPF mice are provided. To obtain reliable and interpretable data, the use of antibodies, accurate and precise methods for tissue digestion and proper gating in flow cytometry experiments are critical elements.

In this study, we examined the immune response of tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific T cells and immune cell profile in patients with HCC separated by cause. Thirty-two patients with hepatitis  virus (HBV)-related HCC, 42 patients with hepatitis C virus-related HCC, and 18 patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ()-related HCC were analyzed. The frequencies of TAA-specific T cells, the expression levels of surface markers on each immune cell, and the expression of each TAA in HCC tissue were measured. The immune response to TAA and immune cell profile were markedly different among the three groups. The immune response to TAA in the -related HCC group was weaker than the responses in the other two groups. In patients with -related HCC, the frequencies of effector regulatory T cells (eTregs) and cluster of differentiation 8-positive (CD8 ) T cells strongly expressing cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 were high. The frequency of CD8 T cells strongly expressing programmed cell death 1 was the highest in patients with HBV-related HCC. Among these immune cell profiles, the frequencies of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 eTregs and CTLA-4 CD8 T cells were inversely correlated with the strength of the TAA-specific T-cell immune response, and the restoration of TAA-specific T-cell responses by anti-CTLA-4 antibody was observed. Conclusion: The immune response to TAA were markedly different among the three groups, and a correlation with the immune cell profile was observed, suggesting that development of immunotherapy based on the etiology of HCC may lead to more effective treatment outcomes.© 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30042374>Silibinin Ameliorates -GlcNAcylation and Inflammation in a Mouse Model of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms underlying the progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to identify the proteins involved in the pathogenesis of liver tissue inflammation and to investigate the effects of silibinin, a natural polyphenolic flavonoid, on steatohepatitis. We performed comparative proteomic analysis using methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced  model mice. Eighteen proteins were identified from the two-dimensional proteomic analysis, which are not only differentially expressed, but also significantly improved, by silibinin treatment. Interestingly, seven of these proteins, including keratin cytoskeletal 8 and 18, peroxiredoxin-4, and protein disulfide isomerase, are known to undergo GlcNAcylation modification, most of which are related to structural and stress-related proteins in  model animals. Thus, we primarily focused on how the GlcNAc modification of these proteins is involved in the progression to . Remarkably, silibinin treatment alleviates the severity of hepatic inflammation along with -GlcNAcylation in steatohepatitis. In particular, the reduction of inflammation by silibinin is due to the inhibition of the -GlcNAcylation-dependent NF-κ-signaling pathway. Therefore, silibinin is a promising therapeutic agent for hyper--GlcNAcylation as well as .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30519965>A round trip from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to diabetes: molecular targets to the rescue?</a></h2><p>Evidence suggests a close relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type two diabetes (T2D). On the grounds of prevalence of disease, both conditions account for a significant financial cost for health care systems and individuals. Aim of this review article is to explore the epidemiological basis and the putative molecular mechanisms underlying the association of NAFLD with T2D. Epidemiological studies have shown that NAFLD is associated to the development of incident T2D and either reversal or improvement of NAFLD will result into decreased risk of developing incident T2D. On the other side of the coin data have shown that T2D will worsen the course of NAFLD doubling the risk of disease progression (i.e. evolution from simple steatosis to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant and death). Conversely, NAFLD will contribute to metabolic decompensation of T2D. The pathogenesis of T2D in NAFLD patients may be mediated by several hepatokines impairing metabolic control. Among these, Fetuin-, which causes glucose intolerance and is increased in patients with T2D and NAFLD with fibrosis is one of the most promising. T2D may affect the progression of NAFLD by acting at different levels of the pathogenic cascade involving gut microbiota and expanded, inflamed, dysfunctional adipose tissue. In conclusion, T2D and NAFLD are mutually, closely and bi-directionally associated. An improved understanding of molecular pathogenesis underlying this bi-directional association may allow us to be able to prevent the development of T2D by halting the progression of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30117754>Unmet needs in pediatric NAFLD research: what do we need to prioritize for the future?</a></h2><p>Pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common disorder that has complex pathophysiology and unquantified clinical significance. Though there have been major advances in the field, there is much yet to be understood. Areas covered: PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase were searched for articles related to pediatric NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () between January 1998 and January 2018. The areas considered to be 'unmet needs' were the relationship between the intestinal microbiome and perinatal events, clinical event risk stratification, and mechanisms underlying portal inflammation. Expert commentary: In utero and ex utero factors have been associated with NAFLD and also with the intestinal microbiome, but it is not yet known how intestinal dysbiosis can be reversed and whether intervention in high-risk neonates could alter their propensity for the metabolic syndrome. Children with NAFLD are at increased risk of cardiovascular, diabetic, and hepatic diseases, but it is unclear how best to stratify children into appropriate risk groups for targeted interventions. Finally, the immune processes underlying pediatric  are thought to differ to those in adult , yet the events surrounding activation of periportal lymphocytes are poorly understood.

Calcium (Ca) homeostasis is considered to play a key role in ER stress. Matrine (Mat) has been applied for the treatment of hepatitis , but its effect on NAFLD is still unknown, and there is no unified view of Mat on the regulation of ER stress in the previous literature.The pharmacological effects were studied in high-fat-diet or methionine-choline-deficient diet induced C57BL/6J mice models and in palmitic acid (PA) induced L02 human liver cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments, computational virtual docking analysis and biochemical assays were used in identifying the locus of Mat.The results showed that Mat-treated mice were more resistant to steatosis in the liver than vehicle-treated mice and that Mat significantly reduced hepatic inflammation, lipid peroxides. The beneficial effect of Mat was associated with suppressing ER stress and restoring mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, Mat decreased the PA-induced lipid accumulation, ER stress and cytosolic calcium level ([Ca]) in hepatocyte cell lines in low and middle dose. However, the high dose Mat did not show satisfactory results in cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments showed that Mat was able to regulate [Ca]. By computational virtual docking analysis and biochemical assays, Mat was shown to influence [Ca] via direct inhibition of SERCA.The results showed that the bi-directional regulation of Mat to endoplasmic reticulum at different doses was based on the inhibition of SERCA.

Here, we examined whether A2AR protects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). In C57BL/6J mice, feeding a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD) resulted in significant weight loss, overt hepatic steatosis, and massive aggregation of macrophages in the liver compared with mice fed a chow diet. MCD feeding also significantly increased the numbers of A2AR-positive macrophages/Kupffer cells in liver sections although decreasing A2AR amount in liver lysates compared with chow diet feeding. Next, MCD-induced  phenotype was examined in A2AR-disrupted mice and control mice. Upon MCD feeding, A2AR-disruptd mice and control mice displayed comparable decreases in body weight and fat mass. However, MCD-fed A2AR-disrupted mice revealed greater liver weight and increased severity of hepatic steatosis compared with MCD-fed control mice. Moreover, A2AR-disupted mice displayed increased severity of MCD-induced liver inflammation, indicated by massive aggregation of macrophages and increased phosphorylation states of Jun-N terminal kinase (JNK) p46 and nuclear factor kappa  (NFκ) p65 and mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-6. In vitro, incubation with MCD-mimicking media increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced phosphorylation states of JNK p46 and/or NFκ p65 and cytokine mRNAs in control macrophages and RAW264.7 cells, but not primary hepatocytes. Additionally, MCD-mimicking media significantly increased lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphorylation states of p38 and NFκ p65 in A2AR-deficient macrophages, but insignificantly decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphorylation states of JNK p46 and NFκ p65 in A2AR-deficient hepatocytes.

The analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. Fragmentation functions are obtained for jets with p_{T}^{jet}>30  GeV/c in events containing an isolated photon with p_{T}^{γ}>60  GeV/c, using charged tracks with transverse momentum p_{T}^{trk}>1  GeV/c in a cone around the jet axis. The association with an isolated photon constrains the initial p_{T} and azimuthal angle of the parton whose shower produced the jet. For central Pb-Pb collisions, modifications of the jet fragmentation functions are observed when compared to those measured in pp collisions, while no significant differences are found in the 50% most peripheral collisions. Jets in central Pb-Pb events show an excess (depletion) of low (high) p_{T} particles, with a transition around 3  GeV/c.

These pathologies are directly related to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), considered a condition of metabolic syndrome (MS). Due to their increasing worldwide prevalence, experimental animal models have been developed to gain a better understanding of its physiopathology; notwithstanding, few studies have evaluated its progression in association with MS and ingestion of sweetened drinks. Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand the pathophysiologic characteristics of NAFLD related to sucrose concentration and time of ingestion in rats. Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups with free access to either tap water or 30% sucrose, and euthanized at 12, 16, or 20 weeks; and 2 additional groups were given free access to either 40% or 50% sucrose and were euthanized at 20 weeks. Biochemical parameters and levels of serum cytokines were measured, and histology was performed. Ingestion of 30% sucrose induced liver steatosis until 16 weeks (grade 2) and 20 weeks (grade 3). Meanwhile, during 20 weeks, 40% sucrose induced grade 5 of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and 50% sucrose induced grade 6 of  and fibrosis. This study demonstrated that increasing time of induction and concentration of sucrose ingestion resulted in a higher grade of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536020>Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Morbidly Obese Bariatric Patients with Concurrent Hepatitis C Viral Infection.</a></h2><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important cause of liver cirrhosis and its complications. The safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in patients with HCV infection is not clear.Charts were reviewed to identify patients with HCV infection before bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgical patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and without  (non-) were recruited as comparative groups. Demographic variables, perioperative data, follow-up, and HCV-related parameters were extracted and compared.Forty-seven bariatric patients between 2000 and 2016 that suffered from HCV infection were identified. The mean age and body mass index (BMI) at baseline were 34.5 ± 9.9 years and 40.4 ± 7.7 kg/m, respectively. The HCV(+) group was associated with female sex, older age, lower BMI, and waist circumference than both  and non- groups. Both HCV(+) and  groups had higher liver function tests and incidence of metabolic syndrome than non- group. The HCV(+) group had lower uric acid and albumin level than the  group. Early major postoperative complication occurred in 1 (2.1%) patient of the HCV(+) group. At follow-up, the mean BMI decreased to 29.1 ± 7.1 kg/m and total weight loss was 25% for the HCV(+) group at 5 years after surgery. The weight loss curves were similar between the HCV(+) group and  group. During follow-up, no patients died but one patient with HCV(+) developed flare up of hepatitis after gastric bypass. The mean liver transaminase level remained in normal range for the HCV(+) group.Co-existence of HCV infection does not influence the outcome of bariatric surgery but continued monitoring of the liver function is indicated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594780>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk of incident acute myocardial infarction and stroke: findings from matched cohort study of 18 million European adults.</a></h2><p>To estimate the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or stroke in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().Matched cohort study.Population based, electronic primary healthcare databases before 31 December 2015 from four European countries: Italy (n=1 542 672), Netherlands (n=2 225 925), Spain (n=5 488 397), and UK (n=12 695 046).120 795 adults with a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD or  and no other liver diseases, matched at time of NAFLD diagnosis (index date) by age, sex, practice site, and visit, recorded at six months before or after the date of diagnosis, with up to 100 patients without NAFLD or  in the same database.Primary outcome was incident fatal or non-fatal AMI and ischaemic or unspecified stroke. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox models and pooled across databases by random effect meta-analyses.120 795 patients with recorded NAFLD or  diagnoses were identified with mean follow-up 2.1-5.5 years. After adjustment for age and smoking the pooled hazard ratio for AMI was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.30; 1035 events in participants with NAFLD or , 67 823 in matched controls). In a group with more complete data on risk factors (86 098 NAFLD and 4 664 988 matched controls), the hazard ratio for AMI after adjustment for systolic blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, total cholesterol level, statin use, and hypertension was 1.01 (0.91 to 1.12; 747 events in participants with NAFLD or , 37 462 in matched controls). After adjustment for age and smoking status the pooled hazard ratio for stroke was 1.18 (1.11 to 1.24; 2187 events in participants with NAFLD or , 134 001 in matched controls). In the group with more complete data on risk factors, the hazard ratio for stroke was 1.04 (0.99 to 1.09; 1666 events in participants with NAFLD, 83 882 in matched controls) after further adjustment for type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol level, statin use, and hypertension.The diagnosis of NAFLD in current routine care of 17.7 million patient appears not to be associated with AMI or stroke risk after adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiovascular risk assessment in adults with a diagnosis of NAFLD is important but should be done in the same way as for the general population.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Methods A total of 33 patients with  and 143 patients with chronic liver disease (66, 24, 22, 10, 1, and 21 patients with hepatitis C, hepatitis , autoimmune hepatitis/primary biliary cholangitis, non-/non-C hepatitis, fatty liver, and alcoholic disease, respectively) who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy between January 2013 and August 2016 were retrospectively assessed to determine the prevalence of autoimmune gastritis. The clinical characteristics of these patients with  and autoimmune gastritis were examined, and the clinical characteristic and biomarkers were compared between patients with  with and without autoimmune gastritis. Results Six of the 33 patients with  (19.4%) were diagnosed with autoimmune gastritis. The prevalence of autoimmune gastritis was higher in patients with  than in those with other chronic liver diseases [4/143 (2.8%), p=0.002]. All six patients with  and autoimmune gastritis exhibited high serum gastrin levels; five of the patients were positive for anti-parietal cell antibodies, and one was negative for anti-parietal cell antibodies but positive for intrinsic factor antibody. Furthermore, 1 patient presented with iron-deficiency anemia (hemoglobin <11 g/dL), but none developed pernicious anemia. Endocrine cell micronests were found in four patients. Patients with  and autoimmune gastritis tended to be older with lower ferritin levels than the other patients.

A range of oral VX-659-tezacaftor-ivacaftor doses in triple combination were then evaluated in randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter trials involving patients with cystic fibrosis who were heterozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and a minimal-function CFTR mutation (Phe508del-MF genotypes) or homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation (Phe508del-Phe508del genotype). The primary end points were safety and the absolute change from baseline in the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV).VX-659-tezacaftor-ivacaftor significantly improved the processing and trafficking of Phe508del CFTR protein as well as chloride transport in vitro. In patients, VX-659-tezacaftor-ivacaftor had an acceptable safety and side-effect profile. Most adverse events were mild or moderate. VX-659-tezacaftor-ivacaftor resulted in significant mean increases in the percentage of predicted FEV through day 29 (P<0.001) of up to 13.3 points in patients with Phe508del-MF genotypes; in patients with the Phe508del-Phe508del genotype already receiving tezacaftor-ivacaftor, adding VX-659 resulted in a further 9.7-point increase in the percentage of predicted FEV. The sweat chloride concentrations and scores on the respiratory domain of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised improved in both patient populations.Robust in vitro activity of VX-659-tezacaftor-ivacaftor targeting Phe508del CFTR protein translated into improvements for patients with Phe508del-MF or Phe508del-Phe508del genotypes.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the changing pattern of etiologic causes of LT in our center for the past 15 years.A cohort of 967 consecutive adult patients with history of LT between 2004 and 2018 in our center was reviewed regarding etiologies for LT. All patients who had a transplant during this time frame were divided into 3 time periods as follows: 2004 to 2009, 2010 to 2013, and 2014 to 2018. All explanted liver samples were sent to pathology for establishment of a definitive etiologic cause.Chronic hepatitis  virus (HBV) infection was the leading cause of LT in the overall cohort (37%), followed by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (11%), and alcoholic liver disease (9.5%).  accounted for 7.5% of the cases. While HBV decreased from 44% in 2004 to 2009 to 36% in 2014 to 2018,  increased from 1.1% to 9.4% in overall transplants during the same period, accounting for one-third of the etiologies for LT following HBV and HCV.There might be a global changing figure regarding etiology for LT in Turkey, especially , which is the fastest growing cause of LT.

Food intake absence and excess are the two main types of energy malnutrition that predispose to the appearance of diseases in adulthood, according to the hypothesis of 'developmental origins of health and disease'. Epidemiological data have shown an association between early-life malnutrition and the metabolic syndrome in later life. Evidence has also demonstrated that nutrition during this period of life can affect the development of the immune system through epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, epigenetics has an essential role in the complex interplay between environmental factors and genetics. Altogether, this leads to the inflammatory response that is commonly seen in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. In conjunction, DNA methylation, covalent modification of histones and the expression of non-coding RNA are the epigenetic phenomena that affect inflammatory processes in the context of NAFLD. Here, we highlight current understanding of the mechanisms underlying developmental programming of NAFLD linked to epigenetic modulation of the immune system and environmental factors, such as malnutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30315846>Selonsertib (GS-4997), an ASK1 inhibitor, antagonizes multidrug resistance in ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is one of the most important mechanisms responsible for the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). Selonsertib, a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, targets apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and is now in phase III clinical trial for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). In this study, we investigated whether selonsertib could reverse MDR-mediated by ABC transporters, including ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC1 and ABCC10. The results showed that selonsertib significantly reversed ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR, but not MDR-mediated by ABCC1 or ABCC10. Mechanism studies indicated that the reversal effect of selonsertib was related to the attenuation of the efflux activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters, without the protein level decrease or change in the subcellular localization of ABCB1 or ABCG2. Selonsertib stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in a concentration-dependent manner, and in silico docking study showed selonsertib could interact with the substrate-binding sites of both ABCB1 and ABCG2. This study provides a clue into a novel treatment strategy, which includes a combination of selonsertib with antineoplastic drugs to attenuate MDR-mediated by ABCB1 or ABCG2 in cancer cells overexpressing these transporters.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

Namodenoson, a selective agonist of the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR), which is highly expressed in pathological liver cells, induces a robust anti‑inflammatory effect in the liver, mediated via the de‑regulation of the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway. Namodenoson also acts as a liver protective agent by inhibiting ischemia/reperfusion injury. Based on these unique characteristics, we investigated the anti‑ effect of Namodenoson in murine models of steatohepatitis and in the LX2 human hepatic stellate cell line (HSC). In the STAM model, Namodenoson significantly decreased the non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score, NAS, demonstrating anti‑inflammatory and anti‑steatotic effects. In the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) model, Namodenoson reversed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to normal values and significantly improved liver inflammation and fibrosis, as well as the adiponectin and leptin levels. Namodenoson de‑regulated the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway in the liver extracts of the CCl4 model mice and in the LX2 HSCs, manifested by a decrease in the expression of phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), nuclear factor κ‑light‑chain‑enhancer of activated  cells (NF‑κ), β‑catenin, lymphoid enhancer‑binding factor 1 (Lef‑1) and cyclin D1, and an increase in the expression level of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK‑3β). The fibrosis marker, α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA) was also de‑regulated, supporting the anti‑fibrotic effect of Namodenoson. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that Namodenoson exerts an anti‑ effect mediated via the de‑regulation of the PI3K/NF‑κ/Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway.

In this study, we aimed to present a subset of patients with APL, who developed severe metabolic abnormalities, from our national lipodystrophy registry.Severe metabolic abnormalities were defined as: poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c above 7% despite treatment with insulin more than 1 unit/kg/day combined with oral antidiabetics), severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides above 500 mg/dL despite treatment with lipid-lowering drugs), episodes of acute pancreatitis, or severe hepatic involvement (biopsy-proven non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ()).Among 140 patients with all forms of lipodystrophy (28 with APL), we identified 6 APL patients with severe metabolic abnormalities. The geometric mean for age was 37 years (range: 27-50 years; 4 females and 2 males). Five patients had poorly controlled diabetes despite treatment with high-dose insulin combined with oral antidiabetics. Severe hypertriglyceridemia developed in five patients, of those three experienced episodes of acute pancreatitis. Although all six patients had hepatic steatosis at various levels on imaging studies,  was proven in two patients on liver biopsy. Our data suggested that APL patients with severe metabolic abnormalities had a more advanced fat loss and longer disease duration.We suggest that these patients represent a potential subgroup of APL who may benefit from metreleptin or investigational therapies as standard treatment strategies fail to achieve a good metabolic control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658321>Thymoquinone reverses nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with experimental hypothyroidism.</a></h2><p>To assess the efficacy of thymoquinone (TQ), the most active constituent in Nigella sativa, which is a medicinal plant from the Ranunculaceae family, in restoring the normal liver structure after 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU)-induced hypothyroidism and explore the mechanism behind this.Hypothyroidism was induced in rats by injection of PTU [6 mg∕kg body weight (.w.)] for six weeks. Twenty-four adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups; the control, TQ-treated at the dose 400 mg∕kg .w., untreated hypothyroidism and TQ-treated hypothyroid groups. Serum levels of thyroid hormones and antioxidant profile were measured. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess gene expression of catalase (CAT). Liver was histopathologically examined using routine and immunohistochemical techniques.Livers of rats with hypothyroidism displayed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the form of steatosis as well as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Moreover, there was an intralobular inflammatory reaction associated with significant (p<0.05) increases in the density of resident hepatic macrophages [cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68)+ cells], as well as in activated hepatic stellate cells, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) index in livers with hypothyroidism. Resolution of hypothyroid NAFLD was observed in livers after treatment with TQ. The significantly increased (p<0.05) steatosis, lobular inflammation, NAFLD activity scores, α-SMA index as well as CD68+ cells induced by hypothyroidism were corrected after TQ administration. Up-regulation of the CAT gene in livers with hypothyroidism after treatment with TQ supported our hypothesis of its antioxidant mechanistic hepatoprotective action.TQ efficiently restores the normal liver histology in hypothyroid rats with up-regulation of the antioxidant CAT gene.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30194936>Sparstolonin  (SsnB) attenuates liver fibrosis via a parallel conjugate pathway involving P53-P21 axis, TGF-beta signaling and focal adhesion that is TLR4 dependent.</a></h2><p>SsnB previously showed a promising role to lessen liver inflammation observed in a mouse model of NAFLD. Since NAFLD can progress to fibrosis, studies were designed to unravel its role in attenuating NAFLD associated fibrosis. Using both in vivo and in vitro approaches, the study probed the possible mechanisms that underlined the role of SsnB in mitigating fibrosis. Mechanistically, SsnB, a TLR4 antagonist, decreased TLR4-PI3k akt signaling by upregulating PTEN protein expression. It also decreased MDM2 protein activation and increased p53 and p21 gene and protein expression. SsnB also downregulated pro-fibrogenic hedgehog signaling pathway, inhibited hepatic stellate cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in hepatic stellate cells, a mechanism that was LPS dependent. Further, SsnB decreased fibrosis by antagonizing TLR4 induced TGFβ signaling pathway. Alternatively, SsnB augmented BAMBI (a TGFβ pseudo-receptor) expression in mice liver by inhibiting TLR4 signaling pathway and thus reduced TGFβ signaling, resulting in decreased hepatic stellate cell activation and extracellular matrix deposition. In vitro experiments on human hepatic stellate cell line showed that SsnB increased gene and protein expression of BAMBI. It also decreased nuclear co-localization of phospho SMAD2/3 and SMAD4 protein and thus attenuated TGFβ signaling in vitro. We also observed a significant decrease in phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 protein, decreased STAT3 activation, alteration of focal adhesion protein and stress fiber disassembly upon SsnB administration in hepatic stellate cells which further confirmed the antagonistic effect of SsnB on TLR4-induced fibrogenesis.Copyright © 2018.

Our goal was to look how lumbar scoliosis modify the clinical and imaging-study in patients with recent-onset inflammatory back pain (IBP) suggesting axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA).Baseline weight-bearing lumbar-spine radiographs obtained in the DESIR cohort of patients aged 18-50 years and having IBP for at least 3 months but less than 3 years suggesting axSpA were studied. After training on scoliosis detection based on Cobb's angle>10° plus -Moe grade≥1, readers blinded to patient data measured spine lumbar scoliosis, sacral horizontal angle, lumbosacral angle and lumbar lordosis on the radiograph of the lumbar and scored sacroiliitis on the radiograph of the pelvis. Baseline MRIs T1 and STIR of the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints were evaluated for respectively degenerative changes and signs of axSpA.Of the 360 patients (50.8% females) 88.7% had lumbar pain and 69.3% met ASAS criteria for axSpA. Mean Cobb's angle was 3.2°±5.0° and 28 (7.7%) patients had lumbar scoliosis. No statistical differences were observed for radiographic sacroiliitis, MRI sacroiliitis, modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score, Pfirmmann score, high-intensity zone, protrusion, extrusion, MODIC score between patients with and without scoliosis. In both groups, degenerative changes by MRI were rare and predominated at L4-L5 and L5-S1.In patients with early IBP suggesting axSpA, lumbar scoliosis was not associated with inflammatory or degenerative changes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, comparison of HCC incidence in various liver diseases has not yet been estimated. We surveyed this comparison.The PubMed database was examined (1989-2017) for studies published in English language regarding the prospective follow-up results for the development of HCC in various liver diseases. A meta-analysis was performed for each liver disease.The annual incidence (%) of HCC in the non-cirrhotic stage and cirrhotic stage, and the ratio of HCC incidence in the cirrhotic stage/non-cirrhotic stage were as follows. (a) hepatitis  virus liver disease: 0.37%→3.23% (8.73-fold), () hepatitis C virus liver diseases: 0.68%→4.81% (7.07-fold), (c) primary biliary cholangitis (0.26%→1.79%, 6.88-fold), (d) autoimmune hepatitis (0.19%→0.53%, 2.79-fold), and (e)  (0.03%→1.35%, 45.00-fold). Regarding primary hemochromatosis and alcoholic liver diseases, only follow-up studies in the cirrhotic stage were presented, 1.20% and 2.06%, respectively.When the liver diseases advance to cirrhosis, the incidence of HCC is markedly increased. The development of HCC must be closely monitored by ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography, irrespective of the different kinds of liver diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

Dietary deficiency of the methyl-donors methionine and choline [methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet] is a well-established model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), yet brain metabolism has not been studied in this model. We hypothesized that supplemental betaine would protect both the liver and brain in this model and that any benefit to the brain would be due to improved liver metabolism because betaine is a methyl-donor in liver methylation but is not metabolically active in the brain. We fed male Sprague-Dawley rats a control diet, MCD diet, or betaine-supplemented MCD (MCD+) diet for 8 wk and collected blood and tissue. As expected, betaine prevented MCD diet-induced . However, contrary to our prediction, it did not appear to do so by stimulating methylation; the MCD+ diet worsened hyperhomocysteinemia and depressed liver methylation potential 8-fold compared with the MCD diet. Instead, it significantly increased the expression of genes involved in β-oxidation: fibroblast growth factor 21 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. In contrast to that of the liver, brain methylation potential was unaffected by diet. Nevertheless, several phospholipid (PL) subclasses involved in stabilizing brain membranes were decreased by the MCD diet, and these improved modestly with betaine. The protective effect of betaine is likely due to the stimulation of β-oxidation in liver and the effects on PL metabolism in brain.-Abu Ahmad, N., Raizman, M., Weizmann, N., Wasek, ., Arning, E., Bottiglieri, T., Tirosh, O., Troen, A.

Icosapent ethyl, a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester, lowers triglyceride levels, but data are needed to determine its effects on ischemic events.We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with established cardiovascular disease or with diabetes and other risk factors, who had been receiving statin therapy and who had a fasting triglyceride level of 135 to 499 mg per deciliter (1.52 to 5.63 mmol per liter) and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 41 to 100 mg per deciliter (1.06 to 2.59 mmol per liter). The patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily (total daily dose, 4 g) or placebo. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina. The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.A total of 8179 patients were enrolled (70.7% for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events) and were followed for a median of 4.9 years. A primary end-point event occurred in 17.2% of the patients in the icosapent ethyl group, as compared with 22.0% of the patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.83; P<0.001); the corresponding rates of the key secondary end point were 11.2% and 14.8% (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.83; P<0.001). The rates of additional ischemic end points, as assessed according to a prespecified hierarchical schema, were significantly lower in the icosapent ethyl group than in the placebo group, including the rate of cardiovascular death (4.3% vs. 5.2%; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.98; P=0.03). A larger percentage of patients in the icosapent ethyl group than in the placebo group were hospitalized for atrial fibrillation or flutter (3.1% vs. 2.1%, P=0.004). Serious bleeding events occurred in 2.7% of the patients in the icosapent ethyl group and in 2.1% in the placebo group (P=0.06).Among patients with elevated triglyceride levels despite the use of statins, the risk of ischemic events, including cardiovascular death, was significantly lower among those who received 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily than among those who received placebo.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily  member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile acid synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile acid profile with increased tauro--muricholic acid (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver. This study is of potential translational significance in determining the role of gut microbiota-mediated bile acid metabolism in modulating diet-induced glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis in the hamster.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31050519>Search for W Boson Decays to Three Charged Pions.</a></h2><p>For the first time, a search for the rare decay of the W boson to three charged pions has been performed.

NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver lesions, including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Although steatosis is often harmless, the lobular inflammation that characterizes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is considered a driving force in the progression of NAFLD. The current view is that innate immune mechanisms represent a key element in supporting hepatic inflammation in NASH. However, increasing evidence points to the role of adaptive immunity as an additional factor promoting liver inflammation. This Review discusses data regarding the role of  cells and T cells in sustaining the progression of NASH to fibrosis and HCC, along with the findings that antigens originating from oxidative stress act as a trigger for immune responses. We also highlight the mechanisms affecting liver immune tolerance in the setting of steatohepatitis that favour lymphocyte activation. Finally, we analyse emerging evidence concerning the possible application of immune modulating treatments in NASH therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580553>n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids for the management of alcoholic liver disease: A critical review.</a></h2><p>Excess alcohol exposure leads to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a predominant cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased  lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

Although haemostatic changes in cirrhosis have been extensively studied, most studies were performed in groups of patients with mixed aetiology. As thrombotic events appear more common in some aetiologies of disease, notably non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and cholestatic disease, we hypothesized that haemostatic changes might be different across aetiologies. We studied 109 patients with cirrhosis (31 cholestatic liver disease, 23 , 37 alcoholic liver disease [ALD], 18 viral hepatitis) and 44 healthy controls. Patients with malignancy were excluded. Routine diagnostic tests of haemostasis, thrombin generation assays, fibrin permeability assays and a plasma-based fibrinolytic assay were performed. All patients had comparable severity of disease according to their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (9 [7-11]). Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor were substantially elevated across all aetiologies, with a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 levels comparable to controls. Thrombin generation capacity was elevated in all aetiologies, most profoundly in ALD. Fibrin permeability was decreased in all aetiologies, which was accompanied by elevated fibrinogen levels. Clot lysis times were prolonged in  and cholestatic disease. Plasma levels of individual proteins were similarly altered in all aetiologies. Our in-depth haemostatic profiling of primary, secondary and tertiary haemostasis in a group of patients with Childs-Turcotte-Pugh A/ cirrhosis showed no large differences between aetiologies, and was consistent with a general hypercoagulable profile in patients with mild cirrhosis. These results suggest that patients with cirrhosis have an increased risk of thrombosis, irrespective of their aetiology.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30019185>Cathepsin  inhibition ameliorates the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis through suppressing caspase-1 activation.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the most common chronic liver disease. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been widely studied in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Cathepsin  (CTSB) is a ubiquitous cysteine cathepsin, and the role of CTSB in the progression and development of NAFLD has received extensive concern. However, the exact roles of CTSB in the NAFLD development and NLRP3 inflammasome activation are yet to be evaluated. In the present study, we used methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet to establish mice  model. CTSB inhibitor (CA-074) was used to suppress the expression of CSTB. Expressions of CTSB and caspase-1 were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Serum IL-1β and IL-18 levels were also determined. Palmitic acid was used to stimulate Kupffer cells (KCs), and protein expressions of CTSB, NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD), and caspase-1 in KCs were detected. The levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in the supernatant of KCs were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our results showed that CTSB inhibition improved the liver function and reduced hepatic inflammation and ballooning, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 were decreased. The expressions of CTSB and caspase-1 in liver tissues were increased in the  group. In in vitro experiments, PA stimulation could increase the expressions of CTSB and NLRP3 inflammasome in KCs, and CTSB inhibition downregulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in KCs, when challenged by PA. Moreover, CTSB inhibition effectively suppressed the expression and activity of caspase-1 and subsequently secretions of IL-1β and IL-18. Collectively, these results suggest that CTSB inhibition limits NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent  formation through regulating the expression and activity of caspase-1, thus providing a novel anti-inflammatory signal pathway for the therapy of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30210131>Hepatitis  Virus Reactivation in a Patient with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis 41 Months after Rituximab-containing Chemotherapy.</a></h2><p>Hepatitis  virus (HBV) reactivation occasionally occurs long after immunosuppressive therapy.

IgG (under)galactosylation is a promising biomarker to assess disease severity, and monitor and adjust therapy. However, this biomarker has not been implemented in routine clinical chemistry because of a complex analytical procedure that necessitates IgG purification, which is difficult to perform and validate at high throughput. We addressed this issue by using endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from  (endoS) to specifically release Fc N-glycans in whole serum. The entire assay can be completed in a few hours and only entails adding endoS and labeling the glycans with APTS. Glycans are then readily analyzed through capillary electrophoresis. We demonstrate in two independent patient cohorts that IgG undergalactosylation levels obtained with this assay correlate very well with scores calculated from PNGaseF-released glycans of purified antibodies. Our new assay allows to directly and specifically measure the degree of IgG galactosylation in serum through a fast and completely liquid phase protocol, without the requirement for antibody purification. This should help advancing this biomarker toward clinical implementation.© 2018 Vanderschaeghe et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30917489>MicroRNA-29a Disrupts DNMT3b to Ameliorate Diet-Induced Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>MicroRNA-29 (miR-29) has been found to reduce liver inflammation and fibrosis following a liver injury. Meanwhile, DNA methyltransferase has been reported to participate in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). The aim of this study is to investigate the miR-29a regulation of methyltransferase signaling and epigenetic program in  progression. Methods: miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates were subjected to the methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced animal model of . Primary hepatic stellate cells were transfected with a miR-29a mimic and antisense inhibitor. We then analyzed gene expressions with qRT-PCR, immunohistochemical stain, Western blot, and luciferase reporter assay. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a alleviated the MCD diet-induced body weight loss and steatosis and decreased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix, as shown with Sirius Red staining concomitant with low fibrotic α-SMA expression within affected tissues compared to the wild-type mice fed the MCD diet. Forced miR-29a expression reduced the MCD diet exaggeration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by immunohistochemically staining 8-OHdG. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of DNMT3b, TGF-β, IL-6, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), p-SMAD3, PI3K, and L3BII expression within the liver tissue. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced DNMT3b expression in primary HSCs. Our data provide new insights that miR-29a improves MCD diet-induced liver inflammation, steatosis and fibrosis, and highlight the potential of miR-29a targeted therapy for treating .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30072434>Crop pests and predators exhibit inconsistent responses to surrounding landscape composition.</a></h2><p>The idea that noncrop habitat enhances pest control and represents a win-win opportunity to conserve biodiversity and bolster yields has emerged as an agroecological paradigm. However, while noncrop habitat in landscapes surrounding farms sometimes benefits pest predators, natural enemy responses remain heterogeneous across studies and effects on pests are inconclusive. The observed heterogeneity in species responses to noncrop habitat may be biological in origin or could result from variation in how habitat and biocontrol are measured. Here, we use a pest-control database encompassing 132 studies and 6,759 sites worldwide to model natural enemy and pest abundances, predation rates, and crop damage as a function of landscape composition. Our results showed that although landscape composition explained significant variation within studies, pest and enemy abundances, predation rates, crop damage, and yields each exhibited different responses across studies, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing in landscapes with more noncrop habitat but overall showing no consistent trend. Thus, models that used landscape-composition variables to predict pest-control dynamics demonstrated little potential to explain variation across studies, though prediction did improve when comparing studies with similar crop and landscape features. Overall, our work shows that surrounding noncrop habitat does not consistently improve pest management, meaning habitat conservation may bolster production in some systems and depress yields in others. Future efforts to develop tools that inform farmers when habitat conservation truly represents a win-win would benefit from increased understanding of how landscape effects are modulated by local farm management and the biology of pests and their enemies.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recently published updated practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing NAFLD, including the following recommendations: Routine screening for NAFLD in high-risk groups is not advised because of uncertainties surrounding test and treatment options, along with a lack of knowledge about cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits. Noninvasive studies, including biomarkers from laboratory tests and liver stiffness measured through elastography, are clinically useful tools for identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with NAFLD who are at increased risk for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () or advanced fibrosis. Weight loss of at least 3% to 5% generally reduces , but greater weight loss (7% to 10%) is needed to improve most histopathologic features, including fibrosis. Pharmacologic therapies (such as pioglitazone and vitamin E) should be considered only in patients with biopsy-proven . Patients with NAFLD should not consume heavy amounts of alcohol, although insufficient data exist to provide advice about other levels of alcohol use. Here, 2 clinicians with expertise in this area debate whether to screen for NAFLD in primary care, how to monitor patients with NAFLD, and what interventions should be used to manage this condition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31282293>Systematic review of cochlear implantation in CHARGE syndrome.</a></h2><p> CHARGE syndrome presents with a collection of congenital anomalies affecting multiple organs.

Systematic review of Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL and clinicaltrials.gov was performed up to 21/10/2018 The review and meta-analysis of studies were performed according to the PRISMA statement. Patient demographics, comorbidity, anatomical factors, details of cochlear implantation and audiological outcome were extracted and summarized. Anatomical and surgical factors were evaluated by meta-analysis. Audiological outcomes reported were too heterogeneous for meta-analysis. All statistics were calculated with SPSS v23.0 (IBM, New York, USA).  Thirty-one studies reported 165 cochlear implants in 156 patients with CHARGE syndrome. Temporal bone and facial nerve anomalies were common.  The assessment and management of patients with CHARGE syndrome undergoing cochlear implantation is challenging. Outcomes may be affected by cochlear nerve deficiency, inner ear anomalies, and developmental delay. Surgery is almost invariably complicated by abnormal anatomy, and increased incidence of complications.

It is one of the most common cancers worldwide and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality. Chronic hepatitis  virus (HBV) infection, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are the most important etiologies of HCC, and effective screening and management strategies are crucial to reduce the HCC risk. For HBV, which accounts for the majority of HCC cases, most infections were acquired via perinatal and early horizontal transmission. Universal vaccination of newborns has led to a decline in HCC incidence compared with the pre-vaccination era. Effective antiviral therapies with nucleos(t)ide analogues or pegylated interferon reduced the incidence of HCC. For HCV, the emergence of effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents has substantially improved cure rates; therefore all patients with HCV should be considered for DAA treatment. The most important obstacle in eliminating HCV is access to therapy. For NAFLD, the global incidence is increasing rapidly, thus its impact on HCC incidence may be explosive. Progression to HCC in NAFLD happens particularly in those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and exacerbated by metabolic syndrome, or PNPLA3 gene polymorphism. Lifestyle changes are imperative while drug therapy has yet to demonstrate substantive protective effects on HCC prevention. For management of HCC, early diagnosis via imaging surveillance among persons with HCC risk factors remains the most important strategy to identify early-stage disease appropriate for resection or transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393374>Analysis of human leukocyte antigen allele polymorphism in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes may play a role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().

NAFLD begins with excessive lipid accumulation in the liver and progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and cirrhosis. NAFLD is closely linked to dysregulated hepatic lipid metabolism. Although recent studies have reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulates lipid metabolism, the roles of EGFR and EGFR inhibitors as modulators of lipid metabolism are largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether inhibiting EGFR using the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) PD153035 improves NAFLD. Our results demonstrate that EGFR was activated in liver tissues from high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice. Inhibiting EGFR using PD153035 significantly reduced phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase  signaling and sterol responsive elementary binding protein 1 and 2 expression, which prevented HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia by reducing de novo lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis and enhancing fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, inhibiting EGFR improved HFD-induced glucose intolerance. In conclusion, these results indicate that EGFR plays an important role in NAFLD and is a potential therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132306>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids alleviate methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.</a></h2><p>The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are products of cytochrome P450 epoxygenases and have recently been found to have an anti-inflammatory activity. However, the role of EETs in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis has not been fully understood. In this study, we investigated the protective role of EETs in methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () in mice and the potential mechanisms. We used 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea(TPPU), a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, to increase the endogenous EET level in mice. Upon TPPU treatment, the liver steatosis and inflammatory damage were significantly ameliorated in mice with steatohepatitis, paralleled by the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) as well as chemokines (CXCL1, MCP-1). Compared with untreated  mice, mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and inflammation relevant adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) were downregulated, whereas mRNA level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α(PPAR-α) was elevated in TPPU-treated mice. In vitro, 11,12-EET treatment remarkably attenuated free fatty acid (FFA)-induced inflammation in HepG2 and THP-1 cells. Further, 11,12-EET inhibited the activation of NF-κ signalling pathway in macrophages from mice with steatohepatitis. Collectively, these results suggest that EETs play a protective role and alleviate the MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis in mice mainly by downregulating activation of NF-κ pathway in macrophages.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30296133>Observation of Higgs Boson Decay to Bottom Quarks.</a></h2><p>The observation of the standard model (SM) Higgs boson decay to a pair of bottom quarks is presented.

Especially, the impact of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is significant with a prevalence of up to 50%. The pathogenesis of NAFLD and the reasons for progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () are still not fully elucidated, but insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction and dyslipidemia seem to be the main drivers. Both HIV-infection itself and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can contribute to the development of NAFLD/ in various ways. As ongoing HIV-related immune activation is associated with insulin resistance, early initiation of cART is needed to limit its duration. In addition, the use of early-generation nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors is also associated with the development of NAFLD/. Patients at risk should therefore receive antiretroviral drugs with a more favorable metabolic profile. Only weight reduction is considered to be an effective therapy for all patients with NAFLD/, although certain drugs are available for specific subgroups. Since patients with  are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, several non-antifibrotic and antifibrotic drugs are under investigation in clinical trials to broaden the therapeutic options. The epidemiology and etiology of NAFLD/ in HIV-positive patients is likely to change in the near future. Current guidelines recommend early initiation of cART that is less likely to induce insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction and dyslipidemia.

Stress is physiological and biological response to maintain homeostasis of body against stressors while severe stress response is an important contributor to various illnesses including metabolic syndrome and brain disorders. We have evaluated the effects of intermittent restraint stress on NAFLD in a HFD-fed mouse model. C57/BL6 mice had free access to a 60% HFD for 8 weeks, with or without intermittent restraint stress (3 h) conducted 3 times a week. HFD administration increased fat accumulation in liver tissues. Unlike the stressed standard diet group, the levels of hepatic total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly ameliorated in the HFD with stress group compared to the HFD alone group. These beneficial results were in accordance with serum levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and hepatic levels of TNF-α and oxidative stress parameters (ROS, NO, and malondialdehyde). The intermittent restraint stress significantly attenuated the HFD-derived alterations in serum insulin levels, hepatic protein kinase  (AKT) activity and gene expression especially related to lipogenesis. This intermittent restraint stress also elevated the serum epinephrine concentration and activated the adrenergic receptor β2 or β 3 in livers or WAT.

Each of these can be the target of natural selection on both host and parasite, which will determine the local outcome of interactions, and potentially lead to coevolution. However, geographical variation in host use and specificity has rarely been investigated. Maculinea (= Phengaris) butterflies are brood parasites of Myrmica ants that are patchily distributed across the Palæarctic and have been studied extensively in Europe. Here, we review the published records of ant host use by the European Maculinea species, as well as providing new host ant records for more than 100 sites across Europe. This comprehensive survey demonstrates that while all but one of the Myrmica species found on Maculinea sites have been recorded as hosts, the most common is often disproportionately highly exploited. Host sharing and host switching are both relatively common, but there is evidence of specialization at many sites, which varies among Maculinea species. We show that most Maculinea display the features expected for coevolution to occur in a geographic mosaic, which has probably allowed these rare butterflies to persist in Europe.

The purpose of this study was to compare chronic aneurysm healing after treatment with SMP FCCs to bare platinum coil (BPC) controls in the rabbit elastase aneurysm model. BPCs or SMP FCCs were implanted in rabbit elastase-induced aneurysms for follow-up at 30 days (n = 10), 90 days (n = 5), and 180 days (n = 12 for BPCs; n = 14 for SMP FCCs). Aneurysm occlusion and histologic healing, including a qualitative healing score, neointima thickness, collagen deposition, and inflammation were compared between the two groups. The mean neointima thickness was significantly greater in groups treated with SMP FCCs for all three time points. Histologic healing scores and collagen deposition quantification suggested that aneurysms treated with SMP FCCs experience more complete healing of the dome by 90 days, but the differences were not statistically significant. More progressive occlusion and recanalization were observed in aneurysms treated with SMP FCCs, but neither difference was statistically significant. Additionally, the SMP foam used in the FCCs was found to degrade faster in the rabbit elastase model than expected based on previous studies in a porcine sidewall aneurysm model. This study suggests that SMP FCCs can promote neointima formation along the aneurysm neck, and may lead to more complete healing of the dome and neck.

The role of different types of fatty acids in driving the early progression of NAFL to  is not understood. Lipid overload causing lipotoxicity and inflammation has been considered as an essential pathogenic factor. To correlate the lipid profiles with cellular lipotoxicity, we utilized palmitic acid (C16:0)- and especially unprecedented palmitoleic acid (C16:1)-induced lipid overload HepG2 cell models coupled with lipidomic technology involving labeling with stable isotopes. C16:0 induced inflammation and cell death, whereas C16:1 induced significant lipid droplet accumulation. Moreover, inhibition of de novo sphingolipid synthesis by myriocin (Myr) aggravated C16:0 induced lipoapoptosis. Lipid profiles are different in C16:0 and C16:1-treated cells. Stable isotope-labeled lipidomics elucidates the roles of specific fatty acids that affect lipid metabolism and cause lipotoxicity or lipid droplet formation. It indicates that not only saturation or monounsaturation of fatty acids plays a role in hepatic lipotoxicity but also Myr inhibition exasperates lipoapoptosis through ceramide in-direct pathway.

The transcriptomics and metabolomics profile of Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice largely reflected the molecular signature of  patients. OCA modulated the expression of these molecular profiles and quenched specific proinflammatory-profibrotic pathways. OCA attenuated specific facets of cellular inflammation in liver (F4/80-positive cells) and reduced crown-like structures in adipose tissue. OCA reduced  collagen formation and attenuated further progression of liver fibrosis, but did not reduce fibrosis below the level before intervention.  HFD-fed Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice recapitulate molecular transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of  patients, and these signatures are modulated by OCA. Intervention with OCA in developing fibrosis reduces collagen deposition and  synthesis but does not resolve already manifest fibrosis in the period studied. These data show that human molecular signatures can be used to evaluate the translational character of preclinical models for .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30466303>Factors associated with delayed and late ART initiation among people living with HIV in BC: results from the engage study.</a></h2><p>We examined correlates of late and delayed initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in British Columbia, Canada. From December 2013 to December 2015 we recruited treatment-naïve people living with HIV who initiated ART within the previous year. 'Late initiation' was defined as CD4 cell count ≤500 cells/µL at ART initiation and 'delayed initiation' as ≥1 year between HIV diagnosis and initiation. Multivariable logistic regression assessed independent correlates of late and delayed initiation. Of 87 participants, 44 (51%) initiated late and 22 (26%) delayed initiation. Delayed initiation was positively associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.06 per year, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.01-1.12) and inversely associated with wanting to start ART at diagnosis (AOR: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.02-0.21). Variables associated with late initiation were older age (AOR: 1.09 per year, 95% CI: 1.03-1.15) and medical reason(s) for initiation (AOR: 5.00, 95% CI: 1.41-17.86). Late initiation was less likely among those with greater perceived ART efficacy (AOR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.98) and history of incarceration (AOR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03-0.56). Disparities in timing of initiation were observed for age, perceived ART efficacy, and history of incarceration. Enhanced health services that address these factors may facilitate earlier treatment initiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385465>Changing trends in the disease burden of primary liver cancer caused by specific etiologies in China.</a></h2><p>Liver cancer is a commonly diagnosed malignancy in China.

The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was used to quantify temporal trends in the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of liver cancer from 1990 to 2017.Nationwide, the number of incident cases of liver cancer increased from 258 000 in 1990 to 515 900 in 2017. The ASIR decreased from 27.16 per 100 000 to 26.04 per 100 000 during this period, with an EAPC of -0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.84, -0.44). The number of deaths increased from 245 300 in 1990 to 418 200 in 2017, and the ASMR decreased from 26.72 to 21.30 (EAPC = -1.16, 95% CI -1.35, -0.97). The most pronounced decreases in the ASIR and ASMR were observed in liver cancer due to hepatitis  and in people aged 15-49 years.Since the extensive efforts for prevention of hepatitis  virus infection, the incidence of liver cancer due to hepatitis  has significantly decreased. However, liver cancer due to hepatitis C, , and other causes remains a major public health concern.

In this study, a cell model of  was induced with oleic acid (OA)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and treated for 36 h with different osthole concentrations. Results showed that intracellular lipid and inflammatory cytokine levels gradually decreased after osthole treatment. These effects, however, were abolished or attenuated after PPARα gene silencing. Accordingly, PPARα gene silencing reversed the osthole-mediated expressions of proteins involved in lipid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation. PPARα gene silencing also abrogated the inhibitory effect of osthole on nuclear factor kappa  p65 protein expression. These findings demonstrate that osthole activates PPARα signaling pathway to inhibit lipid accumulation and inflammatory response in OA/LPS-stimulated hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although hepatitis  and C viral infections are still the main causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the introduction of effective antiviral drugs may control or cure them in the near future. In contrast, the burden of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing for decades, and 25 to 30% of the general population in Korea is estimated to have NAFLD. Over 10% of NAFLD patients may have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of NAFLD. NASH can progress to cirrhosis and HCC. NASH is currently the second leading cause to be placed on the liver transplantation list in the United States. NAFLD is associated with obesity, type 2 , dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. The pathophysiology is complex and associated with lipotoxicity, inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, and insulin resistance. The only proven effective treatment is weight reduction by diet and exercise. However, this may not be effective for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, effective drugs are urgently needed for treating these conditions. Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved for the treatment of NASH. Many pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop new drugs for the treatment of NASH. Some of them are in phase 2 or 3 clinical trials. Here, pharmacologic therapies in clinical trials, as well as the basic principles of drug therapy, will be reviewed, focusing on pathophysiology.Copyright © 2019 Yeungnam University College of Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31031568>Measurement of the top quark mass in the all-jets final state at  and combination with the lepton+jets channel.</a></h2><p>A top quark mass measurement is performed using  of LHC proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS detector at  .

Currently, there has been no approved drug to treat NAFLD or . The current study has presented RLA8, a novel and balanced quadruple agonist for hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation-related peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)-// and G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40), as a  drug candidate. The efficacy of RLA8 to treat  was evaluated in vivo using two mouse models induced by methionine/choline-deficient diet or by high-fat diet, respectively. RLA8 was shown to improve serum alanine aminotransferase and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, reduce hepatic free fatty acid and triglyceride levels, and alleviate insulin resistance. Cytokine and lipoperoxide analysis revealed that RLA8 could reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. Histochemical and morphologic examination of mouse livers showed that RLA8 could improve pathologic changes such as steatosis, ballooning, collagen fiber, and inflammation. Polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses proved that RLA8 could result in PPARs and GPR40 activation, accompanied by upregulation of the 5'AMP-activated protein kinase-acetyl-CoA carboxylase pathway and inhibition of the expression of lipogenic genes and proteins, which provided more insights into its action mechanisms. In summary, RLA8 has significantly better efficacy to improve -induced liver damage such as steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, and, consequently, it represents a new and highly promising  drug candidate that is worthy of further investigation and development.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30569636>Blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum) Prevents Obesity-Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>With increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), effective strategies to prevent  are needed.

Furthermore, blackcurrant attenuated obesity-induced infiltration of macrophages in the liver, in particular, the M1 type, and also suppressed the hepatic expression of fibrogenic genes and fibrosis. Flow cytometric analysis showed that HF significantly increased the percentages of monocytes of total splenocytes, which was markedly attenuated by blackcurrant. HF- decreased lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mRNA expression of interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor α in splenocytes, compared with those from HF controls.

Despite the high prevalence of NAFLD, the underlying biology of the disease progression is not clear, and there are no approved drugs to treat non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), the most advanced form of the disease. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing advanced in vitro human cellular systems to study disease mechanisms and drug responses. We attempted to create an organoid system genetically predisposed to NAFLD and to induce steatosis and fibrosis in it by adding free fatty acids. We used multilineage 3D spheroids composed by hepatocytes (HepG2) and hepatic stellate cells (LX-2) with a physiological ratio (24:1). HepG2 and LX-2 cells are homozygotes for the  I148M sequence variant, the strongest genetic determinant of NAFLD. We demonstrate that hepatic stellate cells facilitate the compactness of 3D spheroids. Then, we show that the spheroids develop accumulations of fat and collagen upon exposure to free fatty acids. Finally, this accumulation was rescued by incubating spheroids with liraglutide or elafibranor, drugs that are in clinical trials for the treatment of . In conclusion, we have established a simple, easy to handle, in vitro model of genetically induced NAFLD consisting of multilineage 3D spheroids. This tool may be used to understand molecular mechanisms involved in the early stages of fibrogenesis induced by lipid accumulation.

GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have significant therapeutic effects on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis () in animal models. However, clinical studies indicated that GLP-1 treatment had little effect on hepatic steatosis in some NAFLD patients, suggesting that GLP-1 resistance may occur in these patients. It is well-known that the gut metabolite sodium butyrate (NaB) could promote GLP-1 secretion from intestinal L cells. However, it is unclear whether NaB improves hepatic GLP-1 responsiveness in NAFLD. In the current study, we showed that the serum GLP-1 levels of NAFLD patients were similar to those of normal controls, but hepatic GLP-1R expression was significantly downregulated in NAFLD patients. Similarly, in the NAFLD mouse model, mice fed with a high-fat diet showed reduced hepatic GLP-1R expression, which was reversed by NaB treatment and accompanied by markedly alleviated liver steatosis. In addition, NaB treatment also upregulated the hepatic p-AMPK/p-ACC and insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1 expression levels. Furthermore, NaB-enhanced GLP-1R expression in HepG2 cells by inhibiting histone deacetylase-2 independent of GPR43/GPR109a.

However, an integrative analysis of the effects of PCBs on the liver and pancreas has never been performed for the two major PCB subtypes, dioxin-like (DL) and nondioxin-like (NDL), and a mixture of NDL/DL PCBs. Therefore, male C57BL/6 J mice fed a control synthetic diet were treated with either a NDL PCB mixture, Aroclor 1260 (20 mg/kg); a single DL PCB congener, PCB 126 (20 μg/kg); a NDL/DL mixture, Aroclor 1260 plus PCB 126; or vehicle control for 2 weeks. PCB126 had the greatest impact on hepatic lipid metabolism. It caused steatosis due to increased hepatic lipid import with associated hypolipidemia. However, all PCB exposures impacted expression of hepatic lipid metabolism genes in different manners. The ' gene', Pnpla3, was elevated by Aroclor 1260, but decreased by all other exposures. The expression of hepatokines implicated in metabolic syndrome (Fgf21, Igf1, and betatrophin) were differentially regulated. The NDL/DL PCB mixture had the greatest effects on pancreatic histology, including acinar cell atrophy, mild steatosis, and fibrosis without ductal changes or immune cell infiltration. It decreased expression of insulin and altered the expression of genes regulating islet identity. None of these exposures was associated with altered HOMA-IR or HOMA-. In summary, PCB exposures differentially regulated liver and pancreas structure and function. Novel mechanisms for PCB-induced endocrine/metabolic disruption included altered hepatokines and Pnpla3 as well as 'PCB pancreatopathy' that was associated with altered expression of pancreatic islet identity factors.

Therefore, in the present paper, we propose a new evolving connectionist (ECoS) approaches for modeling daily reference evapotranspiration (ET) in the Mediterranean region of Algeria. Three ECoS models, namely, (i) the off-line dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system called DEFNIS_OF, (ii) the on-line dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system called DEFNIS_ON, and (iii) the evolving fuzzy neural network called (EFuNN), were statistically compared using the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the coefficient of correlation (R), and the -Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) indexes. The proposed approaches were applied for modeling daily ET using climatic variables from two weather stations: Algiers and Skikda, Algeria. Five well-known climatic variables were selected as inputs: daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (T and T), daily wind speed (W), daily relative humidity (R), and daily sunshine hours (SH). The effect of combining several climatic variables as inputs was evaluated, and at least six scenarios were developed and compared. The proposed ECoS models were compared against the reference Penman-Monteith model referred as "FAO-56 PM". According to the results obtained, the DEFNIS_OF1 model having T, T, W, RH, and SH as inputs, is the best model, followed by the DEFNIS_ON1, and the EFuNN1 is the worst model. The R and NSE value calculated for the testing dataset for the Algiers and Skikda stations were (0.954, 0.910) and (0.954, 0.905), respectively. While both DEFNIS_OF1 and DEFNIS_ON1 showed good accuracy and high performances, the EFuNN1 was less accurate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30230889>Observation of the χ_{b1}(3P) and χ_{b2}(3P) and Measurement of their Masses.</a></h2><p>The χ_{b1}(3P) and χ_{b2}(3P) states are observed through their ϒ(3S)γ decays, using an event sample of proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC.

However, the function of αSyn in T cells is poorly understood. We hypothesized that αSyn can affect CD4 T-cell proliferation and activity. We found that αSyn deficiency exacerbates disease progression in 8 weeks old C57BL6/J EAE-induced mice, and that αSyn-deficient CD4 T cells have increased pro-inflammatory response to myelin antigen relative to wild-type cells, as measured by cytokine secretion of interleukin IL-17 and interferon gamma. Furthermore, expression of αSyn on a background of αSyn knockout mitigates the inflammatory responses in CD4 T cells. We discovered that elevated levels of Nurr1, a transcription factor belonging to the orphan nuclear receptor family, are associated with the pro-inflammatory profile of αSyn-deficient CD4 T cells. In addition, we demonstrated that silencing of Nurr1 expression using an siRNA reduces IL-17 levels and increases the levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine.

The botanical natural product silymarin, which has been investigated as a treatment of , contains flavonolignans that inhibit organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporter function. The purpose of this study was to assess the individual and combined effects of  and silymarin on the disposition of the model OATP substrate pitavastatin. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a control or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet ( model) for 8 weeks. Silymarin (10 mg/kg) or vehicle followed by pitavastatin (0.5 mg/kg) were administered intravenously, and the pharmacokinetics were determined.  increased mean total flavonolignan area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 1.7-fold. Silymarin increased pitavastatin AUC in both control and  animals approx. 2-fold.  increased pitavastatin plasma concentrations from 2 to 40 minutes, but AUC was unchanged. The combination of silymarin and  had the greatest effect on pitavastatin AUC, which increased 2.9-fold compared with control vehicle-treated animals.  increased the total amount of pitavastatin excreted into the bile 2.7-fold compared with control animals, whereas silymarin decreased pitavastatin biliary clearance approx. 3-fold in both control and  animals.

Tissue- and single-cell-based transcriptional profiling was used to define mesenchymal AR target genes. We observed significant AR genomic binding in females and a strong enrichment at proximal promoters in both sexes. In males, there was greater AR binding to introns and intergenic regions as well as to classical AR binding motifs. In females, there was increased proximal promoter binding and involvement of cofactors. Comparison of AR-bound genes with transcriptomic data enabled the identification of novel sexually dimorphic AR target genes. We validated the dimorphic expression of AR target genes using published datasets and confirmed regulation by androgens using  organ cultures. AR targets showed variable expression in patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome. We examined AR function at single-cell resolution using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in male and female mesenchyme. Surprisingly, both AR and target genes were distributed throughout cell subsets, with few positive cells within each subset. AR binding was weakly correlated with target gene expression.© 2019.

The cumulative effects model, which produces matching on concurrent schedules, also achieved the  equilibrium when it was simulated on matching-pennies games. The empirical and simulated compatibility between matching law and  equilibrium predictions can be explained in two ways. Choice to concurrent schedules, where matching obtains, and choice in game play, where the  equilibrium is achieved, may reflect the operation of a common process in choice (e.g., reinforcer maximization) for which matching and achieving the  equilibrium are derivative. Alternatively, if matching in choice is innate as some accounts argue, then achieving the  equilibrium may be an epiphenomenon of matching. Regardless, the wide species generality of matching relations in nonhuman choice suggests game play in chimpanzees would not prove advantaged relative to most species in the animal kingdom.

GM, which is also called "the new virtual metabolic organ", makes axis with a number of extraintestinal organs, such as kidneys, brain, cardiovascular, and the bone system. The gut-liver axis has attracted greater attention in recent years. GM communication is bi-directional and involves endocrine and immunological mechanisms. In this way, gut-dysbiosis and composition of "ancient" microbiota could be linked to pathogenesis of numerous chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis  (CHB), chronic hepatitis C (CHC), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), development of liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this paper, we discuss the current evidence supporting a GM role in the management of different chronic liver diseases and potential new therapeutic GM targets, like fecal transplantation, antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics. We conclude that population-level shifts in GM could play a regulatory role in the gut-liver axis and, consequently, etiopathogenesis of chronic liver diseases. This could have a positive impact on future therapeutic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30180301>Protective effect of isochlorogenic acid  on liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis of mice.</a></h2><p>Liver fibrosis is a common symptom of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and a worldwide clinical issue. The miR-122/HIF-1α signalling pathway is believed to play an important role in the genesis of progressive fibrosis. Isochlorogenic acid  (ICAB), naturally isolated from Laggera alata, is verified to have antioxidative and hepatoprotective properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ICAB on liver fibrosis in  and its potential protective mechanisms.  was induced in a mouse model with a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 4 weeks, and ICAB was orally administered every day at three doses (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg). Pathological results indicated that ICAB significantly improved the pathological lesions of liver fibrosis. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and hepatic hydroxyproline (Hyp), cholesterol (CHO) and triglyceride (TG) were also significantly decreased by ICAB. In addition, ICAB inhibited hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation and the expressions of hepatic genes involved in liver fibrosis including LOX, TGF-β1, MCP-1, COL1α1 and TIMP-1. ICAB also attenuated liver oxidative stress through Nrf2 signalling pathway. What is more, the decreased levels of miR-122 and over-expression of hepatic HIF-1α could be reversed by ICAB treatment. These results simultaneously confirmed that ICAB had a significant protective effect on fibrosis in  by inhibiting oxidative stress via Nrf2 and suppressing multiple profibrogenic factors through miR-122/HIF-1α signalling pathway.© 2018 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497990>Characteristics and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic liver.</a></h2><p>the characteristics, screening, and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for patients without cirrhosis have not been fully studied.A retrospective cohort study was performed in non-cirrhotic patients with histological HCC, between January 2004 and October 2018. Their characteristics, treatment, follow-up and overall survival were described.25 of the 332 patients with HCC met the inclusion criteria (7.5%), 76% were males and the median age was 69.9 years. The main etiology of liver disease was the hepatitis  virus (HBV) (32%), followed by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () (20%). Liver fibrosis was mild (0-1) in 44% of cases. The nodule was diagnosed by ultrasonography in 32% of cases, 60% were found incidentally and 8% due to clinical symptoms. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging was 0 in 4% of cases, A in 88%,  in 4% and C in 4%. The main initial treatment was surgical resection (76%) and 8% refused to be treated. Percutaneous ethanol injection, chemoembolization, sorafenib and palliative care were each performed in 4% of cases. There were some complications in 21% of patients treated with surgery, half of them were severe. The median follow-up was 22.2 (2.9-150.6) months and 56% were in remission and the median overall survival was 57.4 ± 29.8 months. The overall cumulative survival at 1, 3 and 5 years was 84%, 61.6% and 47.9%, respectively.7.5% of HCC presented without cirrhosis and almost half of patients had mild fibrosis. HBV was the main cause of HCC, followed by . The most frequent BCLC stage at diagnosis was early stage and surgery was the most common treatment. Overall cumulative survival at 5 years was almost 50%.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720313>Search for the Higgs Boson Decaying to Two Muons in Proton-Proton Collisions at sqrt[s]=13  TeV.</a></h2><p>A search for the Higgs boson decaying to two oppositely charged muons is presented using data recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy sqrt[s]=13  TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9  fb^{-1}. Data are found to be compatible with the predicted background. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.09 GeV, the 95% confidence level observed (background-only expected) upper limit on the production cross section times the branching fraction to a pair of muons is found to be 3.0 (2.5) times the standard model expectation. In combination with data recorded at center-of-mass energies sqrt[s]=7 and 8 TeV, the background-only expected upper limit improves to 2.2 times the standard model value with a standard model expected significance of 1.0 standard deviation. The corresponding observed upper limit is 2.9 with an observed significance of 0.9 standard deviation. This corresponds to an observed upper limit on the standard model Higgs boson branching fraction to muons of 6.4×10^{-4} and to an observed signal strength of 1.0±1.0(stat)±0.1(syst).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680827>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis aggravates nitric oxide synthase inhibition-induced arteriosclerosis in SHRSP5/Dmcr rat model.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is linked to increased cardiovascular risk, independent of the broad spectrum of metabolic syndrome risk factors. Stroke-prone (SP) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP5/Dmcr) fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet developed hepatic lesions similar to those in human  pathology. These rats simultaneously developed lipid deposits in the mesenteric arteries, cardiac fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction and left ventricle (LV) diastolic dysfunction. However, the intermediary factors between  and cardiovascular disease are still unknown. We investigated whether  aggravates nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibition-induced arteriosclerosis in SHRSP5/Dmcr rats. Wistar Kyoto and SHRSP5/Dmcr rats were divided into 4 groups of 5 and fed the stroke-prone (SP) or HFC diets for 8 weeks. To induce NO synthase inhibition, N -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) mixed with drinking water was administered in the final 2 weeks. The +L-NAME group demonstrated the following characteristics related to arteriosclerosis and myocardial ischaemia: (a) LV systolic dysfunction with asynergy, () replacement fibrosis caused by the shedding of cardiomyocytes and (c) arterial lipid deposition and coronary occlusion secondary to endothelial dysfunction. These characteristics were not observed in the  or non-+L-NAME groups. The SHRSP5/Dmcr rat model demonstrates that  significantly aggravates cardiovascular risk.© 2019 The Authors.
