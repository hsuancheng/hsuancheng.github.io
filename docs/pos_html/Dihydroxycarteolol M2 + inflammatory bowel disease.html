Increasing evidence has shown that macrophages polarize to different phenotypes depending on the intestinal microenvironment and are associated with the progression of IBD. In the present study, we investigated the effect of oxytocin, a neuroendocrinal, and pro-health peptide, on the modulation of macrophages polarization and the progression of experimental colitis. Our data demonstrated that oxytocin decreased the sensitivity of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide stimulation with lower expression of  cytokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, but increased the sensitivity to IL-4 stimulation with enhanced expression of -type genes, arginase I (Arg1), CD206, and chitinase-like 3 (Chil3). This bidirectional modulation was partly due to the up-regulation of β-arrestin2 and resulted in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling and reinforcement of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 phosphorylation. Moreover, oxytocin receptor (OXTR) myeloid deficiency mice were more susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) intervention compared with the wild mice. For the first time, we reveal that oxytocin-oxytocin receptor system participates in modulating the polarization of macrophages to an anti- phenotype and alleviates experimental colitis. These findings provide new potential insights into the pathogenesis and therapy of IBD.© 2019 The Author(s).

Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate IBD. We now assessed if the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic colitis scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10.  macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to - macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating colitis. This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we have set up a study to investigate the effectiveness of two probiotic formulations containing a blend of seven bacterial species in modulating intestinal inflammation in two rodent models of colitis, induced by treating mice with 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Despite the taxonomy of the bacterial species in the two probiotic formulations being similar, only one preparation (Blend 2-Vivomixx) effectively attenuated the development of colitis in both models. In the TNBS model of colitis, Blend 2 reduced the expression of pro- genes while increasing the production of anti- cytokines, promoting the expansion  macrophages and the formation of IL-10-producing Treg cells in the colon's . In the DSS model of colitis,  attenuation and Treg formation was observed only in mice administered with Blend 2, and this effect was associated with intestinal microbiota remodeling and increased formation of lactate, butyrate, and propionate. None of these effects were observed in mice administered with Blend 1 (VSL#3). In summary, we have shown that two probiotic mixtures obtained by combining taxonomically similar species produced with different manufacturing methods exert divergent effects in mouse models of colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30215805>Visceral Adipose Tissue Is Associated With Stricturing Crohn's  Behavior, Fecal Calprotectin, and Quality of Life.</a></h2><p>Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) has been proposed to play a pathogenic role in Crohn's  (CD); however, prospective clinical data are lacking. The aim was to evaluate whether VAT, beyond body mass index (BMI), is associated with CD behavior,  activity, quality of life (QoL), or outcomes.Body composition data and clinical, anthropometric,  activity (fecal calprotectin [FC]), and QoL scores were gathered prospectively on adults with CD at 0, 12, and 24 months. BMI and, VAT metrics (visceral adipose tissue volume [cm3]/height [] index and VAT:subcutaneous adipose tissue [SAT] ratio) were calculated. -related surgery and hospitalization were recorded over extended follow-up (median, 51 months). Multivariable linear mixed effects and logistic regression analyses were performed.Ninety-seven participants were assessed at baseline (55% male; median age, 31 years), 84 at 12 months, and 72 at 24 months. VAT:SAT was positively associated with stricturing  behavior (log odds ratio [OR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32 to 3; P = 0.01) and elevated FC in patients with ileocolonic  (β, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.32 to 2.3; P = 0.01). VAT:SAT was associated with lower QoL, particularly in those with ileal  (β, -12; 95% CI, -19 to -4.5; P = 0.05). However, no prospective associations were observed between serial VAT measurements and time to surgery or hospitalization. No correlations were found between BMI and  behavior, activity, or QoL.VAT:SAT, rather than BMI, is associated with stricturing CD behavior, elevated FC, and reduced QoL in a  distribution-dependent manner. Further studies are required to substantiate the role of VAT as a useful biomarker in CD.© 2018 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Their importance in diagnostics, determination of treatment efficiency, including as predictors of recurrence of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's  is shown.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30837080>A comprehensive review and update on ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic   disorder of the colon that causes continuous mucosal inflammation extending from the rectum to the more proximal colon, with variable extents. UC is characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. UC was first described by Samuel Wilks in 1859 and it is more common than Crohn's  worldwide. The overall incidence and prevalence of UC is reported to be 1.2-20.3 and 7.6-245 cases per 100,000 persons/year respectively. UC has a bimodal age distribution with an incidence peak in the 2nd or 3rd decades and followed by second peak between 50 and 80 years of age. The key risk factors for UC include genetics, environmental factors, autoimmunity and gut microbiota. The classic presentation of UC include bloody diarrhea with or without mucus, rectal urgency, tenesmus, and variable degrees of abdominal pain that is often relieved by defecation. UC is diagnosed based on the combination of clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, histology, and the absence of alternative diagnoses. In addition to confirming the diagnosis of UC, it is also important to define the extent and severity of inflammation, which aids in the selection of appropriate treatment and for predicting the patient's prognosis. Ileocolonoscopy with biopsy is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis of UC. A pathognomonic finding of UC is the presence of continuous colonic inflammation characterized by erythema, loss of normal vascular pattern, granularity, erosions, friability, bleeding, and ulcerations, with distinct demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed . Histopathology is the definitive tool in diagnosing UC, assessing the  severity and identifying intraepithelial neoplasia (dysplasia) or cancer. The classical histological changes in UC include decreased crypt density, crypt architectural distortion, irregular mucosal surface and heavy diffuse transmucosal inflammation, in the absence of genuine granulomas. Abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the preferred initial radiographic imaging study in UC patients with acute abdominal symptoms. The hallmark CT finding of UC is mural thickening with a mean wall thickness of 8 mm, as opposed to a 2-3 mm mean wall thickness of the normal colon. The Mayo scoring system is a commonly used index to assess  severity and monitor patients during therapy. The goals of treatment in UC are three fold-improve quality of life, achieve steroid free remission and minimize the risk of cancer. The choice of treatment depends on  extent, severity and the course of the . For proctitis, topical 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drugs are used as the first line agents. UC patients with more extensive or severe  should be treated with a combination of oral and topical 5-ASA drugs +/- corticosteroids to induce remission. Patients with severe UC need to be hospitalized for treatment. The options in these patients include intravenous steroids and if refractory, calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) or tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies (infliximab) are utilized. Once remission is induced, patients are then continued on appropriate medications to maintain remission. Indications for emergency surgery include refractory toxic megacolon, colonic perforation, or severe colorectal bleeding.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which release immunomodulatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been suggested as an alternative therapeutic option for IBD treatment in veterinary medicine. Furthermore, although it is known that MSCs pre-treated with pro- cytokines show enhanced anti- properties via the secretion of soluble factors, the underlying mechanisms of IBD remain unclear. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the therapeutic effects and corresponding mechanisms of canine adipose tissue-derived (cAT)-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α in mouse models of IBD. Mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis were injected intraperitoneally with cAT-MSCs pre-treated with TNF-α. Colitis severity was assessed and colon tissues were collected for histopathological, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry analysis. cAT-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α secreted higher concentrations of immunomodulatory factors such as TSG-6 and PGE2, which play a key role in inducing phenotypic alterations in macrophages. Consequently, TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs further regulated colonic  cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10, and ameliorated DSS- or DNBS-induced colitis in mice. Additionally, we demonstrated that M1 macrophages (F4/80/iNOS cells) were decreased in colon tissues from mice treated with TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs, whereas  macrophages (F4/80/CD206 cells) were increased. These results may suggest a new cell-based therapeutic option for treating IBD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The embryo is a natural allograft to the maternal immune system. A successful pregnancy depends on the timely extinction of the  response induced by embryo implantation, followed by the switch to a tolerant immune microenvironment in both the uterus and the system. Excessive infiltration of immune cells and serious  responses are triggers for embryo rejection, which results in miscarriage. Here, we demonstrated that adoptive transfer of MSCs could prevent fetal loss in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced abortion model and immune response-mediated spontaneous abortion model. The immunosuppressive MSCs alleviated excessive inflammation by inhibiting CD4T cell proliferation and promoting the decidual macrophage switch to  in a tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6)-dependent manner. Cell-to-cell contact with proinflammatory macrophages increased the TSG-6 production by the MSCs, thereby enhancing the suppressive regulation of T cells and macrophages. Moreover, proinflammatory macrophages in contact with the MSCs upregulated the expression of CD200 on the stem cells and facilitated the reprogramming of macrophages towards an anti- skew through the interaction of CD200 with CD200R on proinflammatory macrophages. Therefore, the results demonstrate that a TSG-6-mediated paracrine effect, reinforced by cell-to-cell contact between MSCs and proinflammatory macrophages, is involved in the mechanism of MSC-mediated abortion relief through the induction of immune tolerance. Our study also indicates the potential application of MSCs in clinical recurrent miscarriages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717366>Neorogioltriol and Related Diterpenes from the Red Alga  Inhibit  in Mice by Suppressing M1 and Promoting -Like Macrophage Responses.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are central mediators of inflammation, orchestrating the  response through the production of cytokines and nitric oxide. Macrophages obtain pro- (M1) and anti- () phenotypes, which can be modulated by soluble factors, including natural products. Despite the crucial protective role of inflammation, chronic or deregulated inflammation can lead to pathological states, such as autoimmune , metabolic disorders, cardiovascular , and cancer. In this case, we studied the anti- activity of neorogioltriol () in depth and identified two structurally related diterpenes, neorogioldiol (), and ,15-cyclo-14-bromo-14,15-dihydrorogiol-3,11-diol (), with equally potent activity. We investigated the mechanism of action of metabolites ⁻ and found that all three suppressed macrophage activation and promoted an -like anti- phenotype by inducing expression of Arginase1, MRC1, IRAK-M, the transcription factor C/EBPβ, and the miRNA miR-146a. In addition, they suppressed iNOS induction and nitric oxide production. Importantly, treatment of mice with  or  suppressed DSS-induced colitis by reducing tissue damage and pro- cytokine production. Thus, all these three diterpenes are promising lead molecules for the development of anti- agents targeting macrophage polarization mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018132>YAP Aggravates  by Regulating M1/ Macrophage Polarization and Gut Microbial Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Inflammation, epithelial cell regeneration, macrophage polarization, and gut microbial homeostasis are critical for the pathological processes associated with  (IBD). YAP (Yes-associated protein) is a key component of the Hippo pathway and was recently suggested to promote epithelial cell regeneration for IBD recovery. However, it is unclear how YAP regulates macrophage polarization, inflammation, and gut microbial homeostasis. Although YAP has been shown to promote epithelial regeneration and alleviate IBD, here we show that YAP in macrophages aggravates IBD, accompanied by the production of antimicrobial peptides and changes in gut microbiota. YAP impairs interleukin-4 (IL-4)/IL-13-induced  macrophage polarization while promoting lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon γ (IFN-γ)-triggered M1 macrophage activation for IL-6 production. In addition, YAP expression is differently regulated during the induction of  versus M1 macrophages.

We uploaded a protocol to PROSPERO (registration number CRD42018089424). Database and manual searches yielded 1823 unique records. Of these, 395 full-texts were screened for eligibility. Finally, 134 reports representing 42 studies were included.We included data from 42 studies of ALL and IBD patients; four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 3,993 patients, 20 observational studies including 796 patients, and 18 case reports including 60 patients. Hepatotoxicity in the form of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) occurred in 9-25% of the ALL patients in two of the four included RCTs using 6TG doses of 40-60 mg//day, and long-term hepatotoxicity in the form of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) was reported in 2.5%. In IBD patients treated with 6TG doses of approximately 23 mg//day, NRH occurred in 14% of patients. At a 6TG dose of approximately 12 mg//day, NRH was reported in 6% of IBD patients, which is similar to the background incidence. According to this review, doses at or below 12 mg//day are rarely associated with notable hepatotoxicity and can probably be considered safe.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920405></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29933526>Lactobacillus acidophilus suppresses intestinal inflammation by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling play significant roles in the pathogenesis of  (IBD).

Mouse colitis was induced using dextran sulfate sodium and confirmed by  activity index and histology. Macrophages and T-cell subsets in isolated peritoneal cavity cells and splenocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Gene and cytokine expression profiles were determined using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA1) and Pediococcus pentosaceus inhibited nitric oxide production in RAW264.7 cells, but only LA1 inhibited Tnfa and induced Il10 expression. LA1 increased the lifespan of dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice and attenuated the severity of colitis by inducing  macrophages in peritoneal cavity cells and Th2 and Treg cells in splenocytes. The restoration of goblet cells in the colon was accompanied by the induction of Il10 expression and the suppression of pro- cytokines. Additionally, we found that LA1 exerts an anti-colitic effect by improving ER stress in HT-29 cells as well as in vivo.We showed that LA1 significantly interferes with ER stress and suppresses NF-κB activation. Our findings suggest that LA1 can be used as a potent immunomodulator in IBD treatment, and the regulation of ER stress may have significant implications in treating IBD.© 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30045418>Development of a screening tool to detect nutrition risk in patients with .</a></h2><p>Malnutrition is a known complication of  (IBD).

Nutrition risk was confirmed by the IBD dietitian (RD) and gastroenterologist (GI). Agreement between screening tools and RD/GI assessment was computed using Cohen's kappa.Of the 110 patients screened, 75 (68.2%) patients had Crohn's  and 35 (31.8%) ulcerative colitis. Mean BMI was 26.4 kg/ (SD=5.8). RD/GI assessment identified 23 patients (20.9%) at nutrition risk. The SaskIBD-NR tool classified 21 (19.1%) at some nutrition risk, while MUST classified 17 (15.5%). The SaskIBD-NR tool had significant agreement with the RD/GI assessment (k 0.83, p<0.001), while MUST showed a lack of agreement (k 0.15, p=0.12).

Depending on stimulation, macrophages rapidly polarize to functionally distinct phenotypes that are involved in the pathogenesis of  (IBD). 1,25‑Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D) has immunomodulatory activity, and 1,25(OH)D deficiency is correlated with autoimmune , especially IBD. This study aimed to explore whether 1,25(OH)D modulates macrophage polarization in inflammation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and colitis mice were treated with 1,25(OH)D. Macrophages were transfected with siRNA-vitamin D receptor (VDR) or miR-125b mimic or inhibitor, and 1,25(OH)D-pretreated colitis mice were injected with a miR-125b agomir. The distribution of macrophage subsets and macrophage subtype characteristics was analyzed. As expected, 1,25(OH)D transformed lipopolysaccharide-induced M1 macrophages to the  subset, downregulated tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin (IL)-6 expression and interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) phosphorylation, and upregulated IL-10, arginase-1, VDR, and IRF4 expression. SiRNA-VDR and miR-125b mimic significantly impaired 1,25(OH)D activity. In colitis mice, 1,25(OH)D pretreatment ameliorated  activity, converted M1 macrophages to the  subtype, suppressed IRF5 phosphorylation, and increased IRF4 expression in lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC). miR-125b agomir injections reversed 1,25(OH)D action. Collectively, the results demonstrate that 1,25(OH)D downregulates miR-125b expression and promotes M1 macrophage polarization to the  subtype. 1,25(OH)D pretreatment ameliorated colitis by restoring the LPMC macrophage subtype balance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The -purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of higher BMI on patients undergoing surgery for UC.UC patients who underwent surgery between April 2012 and August 2015 were included. Higher BMI was defined as a BMI ≥25 kg/. Patients were classified as having a higher BMI or an unelevated BMI. We analyzed comparison characteristics, surgical outcomes, and pouch-related complications (PRC). Possible risk factors for PRC were also analyzed.A total of 16 out of 165 (9.7%) patients had higher BMIs. The incidence of PRC in patients with higher BMIs was significantly higher than in those with unelevated BMIs. Male gender (OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.23-15.4, p = 0.02) and BMI ≥25 kg/ (OR 5.87, 95% CI 1.59-21.67, p < 0.01) were identified as independent risk factors for PRC.UC patients with higher BMIs had significantly higher incidences of PRC. Male gender and a higher BMI were identified as independent risk factors for PRC. The pouch operation as an initial surgery may be avoided in patients with higher BMIs to prevent PRC.© 2018 S.

Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have attracted attention based on their multitude of functions including anti- effects. However, proper timing of MSC therapy and the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MSCs on colitis are not fully elucidated. Human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAdMSCs; 1 × 10) were administrated via the tail vein on day 3 (early) or 11 (delayed) using a 7-day dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model of colitis. The effects were evaluated based on colon length,  activity index (DAI) and histological score. Cytokine-encoding mRNA levels T cells and macrophages were evaluated by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Regarding the timing of administration, early (day 3) injection significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in terms of both DAI and histological score, compared to those parameters with delayed (day 11) injection. With early cell injection, the tissue mRNA levels of anti- cytokine genes (Il10, Tgfb) increased, whereas those of  cytokine genes (Il6, Tnfa and Il17a) decreased significantly. Regarding the associated mechanism, hAdMSCs suppressed T cell proliferation and activation in vitro, increased the number of regulatory T cells in vivo and changed the polarity of macrophages (into the anti-  phenotype) in vitro. Timing of injection is critical for the effective therapeutic effects of hAdMSCs. Furthermore, part of the associated mechanism includes T cell activation and expansion and altered macrophage polarization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30202097>Loss of solute carrier family 7 member 2 exacerbates inflammation-associated colon tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Solute carrier family 7 member 2 (SLC7A2, also known as CAT2) is an inducible transporter of the semi-essential amino acid L-arginine (L-Arg), which has been implicated in wound repair. We have reported that both SLC7A2 expression and L-Arg availability are decreased in colonic tissues from  patients and that mice lacking Slc7a2 exhibit a more severe  course when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Here, we present evidence that SLC7A2 plays a role in modulating colon tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS model of colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC). SLC7A2 was localized predominantly to colonic epithelial cells in WT mice. Utilizing the AOM-DSS model, Slc7a2 mice had significantly increased tumor number, burden, and risk of high-grade dysplasia vs. WT mice. Tumors from Slc7a2 mice exhibited significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines IL-1β, CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-3, CXCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, but decreased levels of IL-4, CXCL9, and CXCL10 compared to tumors from WT mice. This was accompanied by a shift toward pro-tumorigenic  macrophage activation in Slc7a2-deficient mice, as marked by increased colonic CD11bF4/80ARG1 cells with no alteration in CD11bF4/80NOS2 cells by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. The shift toward  macrophage activation was confirmed in bone marrow-derived macrophages from Slc7a2 mice. In bone marrow chimeras between Slc7a2 and WT mice, the recipient genotype drove the CAC phenotype, suggesting the importance of epithelial SLC7A2 in abrogating neoplastic risk. These data reveal that SLC7A2 has a significant role in the protection from CAC in the setting of chronic colitis, and suggest that the decreased SLC7A2 in  (IBD) may contribute to CAC risk. Strategies to enhance L-Arg availability by supplementing L-Arg and/or increasing L-Arg uptake could represent a therapeutic approach in IBD to reduce the substantial long-term risk of colorectal carcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30485836>A multicentre Study of Nutrition Risk Assessment in Adult Patients with  Attending Outpatient Clinics.</a></h2><p>Overnutrition and undernutrition can affect patients with  (IBD). Although all IBD outpatients should be screened for nutrition risk, screening is not routinely performed, potentially leading to reduced identification and treatment. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of nutrition risk in adult IBD outpatients and the proportion of cases who discussed diet and/or nutrition during their routine clinical appointment.Adults with IBD attending outpatient clinics at 4 hospitals in Greece and in UK were recruited. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected using face-to-face patient interviews and clinical records. Patients were classified as high (i.e., body mass index [BMI] < 18.5 or 18.5-20 kg/ and weight loss > 5%), moderate (i.e., BMI 20-25 kg/ and weight loss > 5%) or low risk of undernutrition and high risk of obesity (i.e., BMI 25-30% and weight gain > 5%). The proportion of patients who discussed diet and/or nutrition during their clinical appointment was calculated.In total, 390 IBD patients participated. Sixteen (4%) patients were underweight, 113 (29%) were overweight and 71 (18%) were obese. Twenty-one (5%) patients were at high risk of undernutrition; of these 4 (19%) were under dietetic care. Of those at high risk of undernutrition, 11 (52%) had discussed diet and/or nutrition during their routine clinical appointment. Fifty-six (14%) patients had gained more than 5% weight since their last recorded/reported weight and 19 (5%) were at high risk of obesity.Few patients were identified to be at high risk of undernutrition and less than a fifth of these were under dietetic care. Overnutrition is a growing problem in IBD with almost half of adult patients being overweight or obese. Diet and/or nutrition were not routinely discussed in this group of IBD outpatients.© 2018 S.

The present study investigated the potential role of autophagy in stress-related IBD in patients and animal model. The correlation between psychosocial stress and intestinal autophagy was determined in 23 patients with IBD. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a well-established inducer of psychosocial stress, was administrated in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). In IBD patients, the autophagy markers beclin-1, LC3-II/I ratio, Atg16L1, and Atg4B were significantly enhanced. The psychosocial stress score was positively associated with the levels of beclin-1 and the LC3II/I ratio in intestinal biopsy specimens. In IBD mouse model, CRH significantly aggravated intestinal inflammation, increased Paneth cell metaplasia, and enhanced intestinal autophagy (beclin-1, Atg16L1, PIK3R4, and Atg4B upregulation; GAA, CTSD, and PPKAA1 downregulation). Additionally, the CRH-induced gut microbial dysbiosis was evidenced by a marked increase in the number of detrimental bacteria. In LPS-stimulated BMDM, CRH substantially increased M1/ polarization and thus promoted inflammation. In both IBD mice and LPS-treated BMDM, blockade of autophagy by chloroquine abrogated the unbeneficial effects of CRH, whereas autophagy inducer rapamycin resulted in a pronounced protective effect against IBD lesion. Our data demonstrate that psychosocial stress may link the enhanced intestinal autophagy by modulating gut microbiota and inflammation to aggravate IBD. These data indicate autophagy as a promising therapeutic target for psychosocial stress-related IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30427909>Non-alcoholic fatty liver  in underweight patients with : A case-control study.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver  (NAFLD) was shown to also occur in lean and underweight patients. So far, the prevalence of NAFLD in underweight individuals with and without  (IBD) is insufficiently enlightened. In this cross-sectional age, gender and -matched case-control study, underweight patients (BMI<18.5 kg/) with  (IBD), who underwent abdominal MRI at 1.5 T/3 T with fat-saturated fast-spin-echo imaging from 10/2005-07/2018 were analysed (control-to-case-ratio 1:1, n = 130). All patients were additionally investigated for duration, history of surgery, medical treatment, laboratory values, liver and spleen diameters. On MRI, liver fat was quantified by two observers based on the relative signal loss on T2-weighted fast spin-echo MR images with fat saturation compared to images without fat saturation. The prevalence of NAFLD/liver steatosis, defined as a measured intrahepatic fat content of at least 5%, was significantly higher in underweight IBD patients than in normal weight patients (87.6% versus 21.5%, p<0.001). Compared to the cases, the liver fat content of the controls was reduced by -0.19 units on average (-19%; 95%Cl: -0.20; -0.14). Similar results were obtained for the subgroup of non-IBD individuals (n = 12; -0.25 units on average (-25%); 95%Cl: -0.35; -0.14). Patients with extremely low body weight (BMI <17.5 kg/) showed the highest liver fat content (+0.15 units on average (+15%) compared to underweight patients with a BMI of 17.5-18.5 kg/ (p<0.05)). Furthermore, underweight patients showed slightly increased liver enzymes and liver diameters. There were no indications of significant differences in  duration, type of medications or surgery between cases and controls and also, there were no significant differences between observers or field strengths (p>0.05).

In this study, we examined the effect of ritonavir on inflammation  and  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were activated with anti-CD3 in the presence or absence of ritonavir and analyzed by flow cytometric analysis. Frequencies of CD4+ cells were significantly affected by ritonavir (CD69+ =3E-05; CD134 =4E-06; CD25+ =E-07; central memory =0.02; effector =6E-03; effector memory =6E-05). To corroborate that inflammation has a metabolic effect , a mouse model was used that is based on immunocompromised NOD-scid   mice reconstituted with PBMCs from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Inflammation had a significant effect on amino acid (AA) levels (Glu =1E-07, Asp =1E-04). Principal component analysis (PCA) discriminated between unchallenged and challenged groups. Finally, the efficacy of ritonavir was tested in the same mouse model. Dependent variables were clinical and histological scores, frequencies of human leukocytes isolated from spleen and colon, and levels of AA in sera of mice. Mice benefited from treatment with ritonavir as indicated by significantly decreased colon (=7E-04) and histological (=1E-04) scores, frequencies of  monocytes (CD14+ CD163; =0.02), and Glu levels (=2E-05).

However, only few clinical studies have adequately explored the importance of body composition in the nutritional assessment of Chinese patients with IBD.A total of 78 IBD patients were enrolled, and Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) was used to assess malnutrition. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to analyze the body composition of IBD patients and their fat free mass indexes (FFMI) were also calculated. FFMI values <17 kg/ in men and <15 kg/ in women were considered low. Food consumption data were collected using the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire.Of the 78 patients, 49 (62.8%) had low-FFMI. Among the patients with PG-SGA <4, 12 (41.4%) had altered body composition with low-FFMI. FFMI negatively correlated with the PG-SGA scores and  activity. No statistically significant differences in fat free mass (FFM) and skeletal muscle mass were observed between patients in the active phase and patients in remission (p>0.05). However, the fat mass and visceral fat area of patients in remission were higher than those of patients in the active phase (p<0.05). The average energy derived from fat, proteins and carbohydrates was 29.6±8.45%, 10.4±1.97% and 60.3±9.33%, respectively.Our study shows that 41.4% of IBD patients had altered body composition despite being well-nourished according to the PG-SGA.

Development of CRC is associated with a number of genetic or somatic mutations. New, non-invasive stool tests are currently being developed based on the detection of these alterations. We investigated if a non-invasive stool assay can offer sufficient sensitivity and specificity to supplement colonoscopy-based screening.We compared a combined stool assay, which incorporates fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), quantification of human DNA (hDNA) as well as detection of genetic mutations of KRAS and BRAF (Combined DNA stool assay), with commercially available FOBT and -PK tests in a multi-centric six-armed pre-clinical case cohort study. Seven hundred thirty-four patients were recruited prior to elective/screening colonoscopy or prior to surgery in case of a recent CRC diagnosis. According to clinical assessment and colonoscopy/histology results, the following groups were assigned: controls, irritable  syndrome (IBS),  (IBD), hyperplastic polyps, adenomas, and CRC. Finally, 566 out of 734 patients (77.1%) were screened for CRC and overall gut status via colonoscopy, FOBT, -PK, with combined FOBT/-PK and the Combined DNA stool assay as described here.All sensitivities and specificities are measured against histologically confirmed results by colonoscopy. Confirmed sensitivities for detecting colorectal cancer were 68% with FOBT, 83% with -PK, 90% with combined FOBT and -PK, and 85% with the Combined DNA stool assay. Specificities were 96% with FOBT, 61% with -PK, 62% with combined FOBT and -PK, and 92% with the Combined DNA stool assay in the control group with no pathological findings during colonoscopy.The Combined DNA stool assay detects CRC with a significantly higher Youden Index than the other reviewed non-invasive screening options.

The pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib has shown efficacy in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. However, concerns regarding adverse events due to their wide spectrum inhibition fueled efforts to develop selective JAK inhibitors. Given the crucial role of myeloid cells in intestinal immune homeostasis, we evaluated the effect of pan-JAK and selective JAK inhibitors on pro- and anti- macrophage polarization and function (M1/) and in experimental colitis.Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages or human monocytes were treated using JAK1 and JAK3 selective inhibitors (JAK1i;JAK3i) and tofacitinib and were evaluated by transcriptional, functional, and metabolic analyses. In vivo, oral administration of JAK1i and tofacitinib (10 or 30 mg/kg) was tested in both acute and acute rescue dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis.Both tofacitinib and JAK1i but not JAK3i effectively inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation and interferon gamma-induced transcripts in M1 polarized macrophages. Strikingly, transcriptional profiling suggested a switch from M1 to  type macrophages, which was supported by increased protein expression of -associated markers. In addition, both inhibitors enhanced oxidative phosphorylation rates. In vivo, JAK1i and tofacitinib did not protect mice from acute DSS-induced colitis but ameliorated recovery from weight loss and  activity during acute rescue DSS-induced colitis at the highest dose.JAK1i and tofacitinib but not JAK3i induce phenotypical and functional characteristics of anti- macrophages, suggesting JAK1 as the main effector pathway for tofacitinib in these cells. In vivo, JAK1i and tofacitinib modestly affect acute rescue DSS-induced colitis.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The precise etiology of IBD is unknown but it involves a complex interplay of factors associated with the immune system, environment, host genotype and enteric commensal bacteria. As there is no known safe cure for IBD, natural alternative therapeutic options without side effects are urgently needed. To this end, Soy-based foods, which have been eaten for centuries in Asian countries, have potential benefits, including lowering the incidence of coronary heart , atherosclerosis, type-2 diabetes, allergic response, and autoimmune . This study describes the effect of Soy isoflavons 4', 5, 7 Trihydroxyisoflavone (genistein) on dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) induced experimental colitis. The extent and severity of  was analyzed through body weight, histopathological analysis, cellular immune response, systemic cytokine levels, and inflammation score using a  activity index. Genistein treatment significantly attenuated DSS-induced colitis severity and resulted in increase in body weight, colon length and reduction in inflammation score. Genistein also skews M1 macrophages towards the  phenotype. Further, gen also reduced the systemic cytokine levels as compared to vehicle control. This serves as the first detailed study towards natural soya based product that shows the polarization of M1 towards  macrophages, and reduction of systemic cytokine in part to attenuate the colitis symptoms.

The objective of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of combined sufasalazine and ASCs therapy in a rat model of IBD. After induction of colitis in rats, ASCs were cultured and intraperitoneally injected (3 × 10 cells/kg) into the rats on Days 1 and 5 after inducing colitis, in conjunction with daily oral administration of low dose of sulfasalazine (30 mg/kg). The regenerative effects of combination of ASCs and sulfasalazine on ulcerative colitis were assessed by measuring body weight, colonic weight/length ratio,  activity index, macroscopic scores, histopathological examinations, cytokine, and inflammation markers profiles. In addition, western blot analysis was used to assess the levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and apoptosis related proteins in colitis tissues. Simultaneous treatment with ASCs and sulfasalazine was associated with significant amelioration of  activity index, macroscopic and microscopic colitis scores, as well as inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokines in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Moreover, combined ASCs and sulfasalazine therapy effectively inhibited the NF-κB signaling pathway, reduced the expression of Bax and prevented the loss of Bcl-2 proteins in colon tissue of the rats with TNBS-induced colitis. Furthermore, combined treatment with ASCs and sulfasalazine shifted  M1 to anti-  macrophages by decreasing the levels of MCP1, CXCL9 and increasing IL-10, Arg-1 levels. In conclusion, combination of ASCs with conventional IBD therapy is potentially a much more powerful strategy to slow the progression of colitis via reducing  and apoptotic markers than either therapy alone.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30113218>Interactions of helminths with macrophages: therapeutic potential for  intestinal .</a></h2><p>Macrophages represent a highly heterogeneous and plastic cell type found in most tissues of the body; the intestine is home to enormous numbers of these cells.

A PBD and dietary guidance were provided during a two-week hospitalization.The primary end point was relapse (a flare-up that required more aggressive treatment) during the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate the cumulative relapse rate. Secondary end points were immediate improvement in symptoms or laboratory data during hospitalization and a chronologic change in the PBD score, which evaluated adherence to the PBD.Sixty cases were studied: 29 initial episode cases and 31 relapse cases.

MiR-146b appears to control macrophage activation and cell proliferation.By loading miR-146b mimic on mannose-modified trimethyl chitosan [MTC]-conjugated nanoparticles [NPs] [MTC-miR146b], a molecular targeted immunotherapeutic approach was developed to selectively target intestinal macrophages for mucosal regeneration and tumourigenesis in mouse models.We first confirmed that miR-146b expression was significantly enhanced during mucosal regeneration in a murine colitis model. Moreover， after mucosal damage, MTC-miR146b mimic-treated wild-type mice had dramatically restored body weight and mucosal barrier function compared with MTC-NC treated mice. Strikingly, MTC-miR146b mimic oral administration protected miR-146b-deficient mice from dextran sodium sulphate [DSS] injury and the colitis-associated cancer process. Mechanistically, miR-146b strongly inhibited M1 macrophage activation by suppressing the Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4] signalling pathway, resulting in the repression of the induction of pro- cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. More importantly, miR-146b overexpression in bone marrow-derived macrophages [BMDMs] in M1 differentiation conditions induced a phenotype similar to  macrophages and improved the proliferation of co-cultured colonic epithelial cells via STAT3-dependent IL-10 production.MTC-miR146b should be regarded as an effective candidate for oral delivery and could improve the efficacy of immunotherapies for ulcerative colitis and colitis-associated cancer.Copyright © 2018 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

The change in cell morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy. The expression of CD206, arginase (Arg)-1, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were examined by western blotting. The production of  cytokines was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and statistical comparisons were made. The results showed that treatment of RAW264.7 cells with NecroX-5 caused an elongated shape in comparison to non-treated cells. The expression levels of macrophage mannose receptor CD206 and Arg-1, specific markers of  cells, were significantly upregulated by NecroX-5 treatment, while those of iNOS (M1 macrophages) was decreased. In addition, NecroX-5 significantly reduced the secretion of  cytokines, while interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 secretion in the supernatant was significantly enhanced. Treatment with NecroX-5 considerably ameliorated the progression of DSS-induced colitis and significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of pro- cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1β. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that NecroX-5 might dampen inflammation by switching the M1 phenotype to the  phenotype due to IL-4 and IL-13 induction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, their efficacy and mechanism in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), a type of chronic , are unclear. To investigate the effects and possible mechanism of EVs in UC treatment, we established an in vitro model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated macrophages and an in vivo dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model to mimic UC. In vitro, EVs promoted the proliferation and suppressed  response in LPS-induced macrophages, as demonstrated by the up-regulation of pro- factors (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12) and down-regulation of the anti- factor IL-10. In the in vivo model, EV administration ameliorated the symptoms of UC by reducing weight loss,  activity index, and colon mucosa damage and severity while increasing colon length. This was additionally accompanied by the increase in IL-10 and TGF-β levels and the decline in VEGF-A, IFN-γ, IL-12, TNF-α, CCL-24, and CCL-17 levels. In terms of the mechanism, EVs promoted -like macrophage polarization, characterized by the increase in the  marker CD163. Furthermore, the positive effect of EVs on UC repair seemed to be related to the JAK1/STAT1/STAT6 signaling pathway. Collectively, BMSC-derived EVs exerted positive therapeutic effects against DSS-induced UC, which could be due to a negative  response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
