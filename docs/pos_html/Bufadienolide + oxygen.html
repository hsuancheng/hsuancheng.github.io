Here, we report that resibufogenin, a member of  family, suppresses the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) through induction of necroptosis in vivo.SW480 cells with stably expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein were xenografted to BALB/c-nu mice to observe the growth of tumors. Liver metastasis was observed by injection of MC38 cells beneath the splenic capsule of mice. Protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and western blot.Consolidated in vitro results indicate that resibufogenin has anti-proliferative activity on CRC cells. PI staining and transmission electron microscope imaging suggest that the cell death induced by resibufogenin are mainly through necrosis, which is further confirmed by the ineffectiveness of z-VAD, a pan-caspase general inhibitor. In particular, resibufogenin induced necrosis is substantially abrogated in receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts. The RIP3-dependent necrosis has been classified as necroptosis. Resibufogenin triggeres necroptosis through upregulating RIP3 and phosphorylating mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein at Ser358. Resibufogenin also activates the expression of PYGL, GLUD1 and GLUL in a RIP3-dependent manner. Resibufogenin exerts cytotoxic effect by inducing reactive oxygen species accumulation which can be neutralized by N-acetylcysteine. Remarkably, resibufogenin significantly suppresses liver-metastasis from spleen implantation. The anti-neoplastic effect of this compound can be abrogated by RIP3 knockdown.Resibufogenin suppresses growth and metastasis of CRC through RIP3-mediated necroptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839155>Cinobufagin suppresses colorectal cancer angiogenesis by disrupting the endothelial mammalian target of rapamycin/hypoxia-inducible factor 1α axis.</a></h2><p>Inducing angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancers that sustains tumor growth and metastasis. Neovascularization is a surprisingly early event during the multistage progression of cancer. Cinobufagin, an important  originating from Chan Su, has been clinically used to treat cancer in China since the Tang dynasty. Here, we show that cinobufagin suppresses colorectal cancer (CRC) growth in vivo by downregulating angiogenesis. The hierarchized neovasculature is significantly decreased and the vascular network formation is disrupted in HUVEC by cinobufagin in a dose-dependent way. Endothelial apoptosis is observed by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction which can be neutralized by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is reduced and phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2481 and Akt at Ser473 is downregulated in HUVEC. Endothelial apoptosis is triggered by cinobufagin by stimulation of Bax and cascade activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3. Increased endothelial apoptosis rate and alterations in the HIF-1α/mTOR pathway are recapitulated in tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Further, the anti-angiogenesis function of cinobufagin is consolidated based on its pro-apoptotic effects on an EOMA-derived hemangioendothelioma model. In conclusion, cinobufagin suppresses tumor neovascularization by disrupting the endothelial mTOR/HIF-1α pathway to trigger ROS-mediated vascular endothelial cell apoptosis. Cinobufagin is a promising natural anti-angiogenetic drug that has clinical translation potential and practical application value.© 2019 The Authors.

Following the recent discovery that oxidative damage possibly be an important cause of the cardiac toxicity of cardenolides, a strategy fusing the antitumor agent arenobufagin with a benzoisoselenazol fragment, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, has been developed. Six novel hybrids were synthesized and their ROS scavenging activities as well as their in vitro cytotoxicity against the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, an adriamycin-resistant subline HepG2/ADM, and the human myocardial cell line AC16 were evaluated. The results indicate that the hybrids exhibit various degrees of in vitro ROS scavenging activities, and weaker cytotoxicity than that of arenobufagin against the myocardial cell line AC16. These findings suggest the feasibility of a strategy in which the cardiotoxicity of the potential antitumor agent arenobufagin is reduced.Copyright © 2018.

The mortality rate for ARDS has been maintained within the range of 40-52%. The authors have examined the involvement of the "cardiotonic steroids" in the pathogenesis and therapy of ARDS. We have studied the possible role of the , marinobufagenin (MBG), in the pathogenesis of ARDS in both a rat model of ARDS and in patients afflicted with that disorder. In addition, the potential therapeutic benefit of an antagonist of MBG, resibufogenin (RBG), in an animal model has been evaluated.A syndrome resembling human ARDS was produced in the rat by exposing the animals to 100% oxygen for 48 h. In other animals, RBG was administered to these "hyperoxic" rats, and the serum MBG was measured. In human ICU patients, urinary samples were examined for levels of MBG, and the values were compared to those obtained from other ICU patients admitted with diagnoses other than ARDS.(1) Exposure of rats to hyperoxia produced a histologic picture which resembled that of human ARDS. (2) Serum levels of MBG in the "hyperoxic" rats substantially exceeded those obtained in animals exposed to ambient oxygen levels and were reduced to normal by RBG. (3) In ARDS patients, substantial elevations in urinary MBG were obtained compared to those in non-ARDS ICU patients.MBG may serve as an important biomarker for the development of ARDS, and RBG may represent a preventative/therapy in this disorder.</p></html>
