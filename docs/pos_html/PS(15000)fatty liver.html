We characterized how maternal phytosterol () supplementation affected serum lipids and the expression of lipid-regulatory genes in the intestine and  of newly-weaned apo-E deficient offspring from dams fed a chow diet supplemented with cholesterol (.%, CH) or cholesterol and  (2%) (CH/) throughout pregnancy and lactation.Serum lipid concentrations and lipoprotein particle numbers were exacerbated in offspring from cholesterol-supplemented mothers but normalized to chow-fed levels in pups exposed to  through the maternal diet during gestation and lactation. Compared with the CH pups, pups from -supplemented mothers demonstrated higher (p < .05) expression of the primary intestinal cholesterol transport protein (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) and the rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoAr), suggestive of a compensatory response to restore cholesterol balance. Furthermore, pups from -supplemented mothers exhibited a coordinated downregulation (p < .05) of several genes regulating  acid synthesis including PGC1β, SREBP1c, FAS, and ACC compared with the CH group. These results suggest that maternal  supplementation during hypercholesterolemic pregnancies protects against aberrant lipid responses in newly-weaned offspring and results in differential regulation of cholesterol and lipid regulatory targets within the enterohepatic loop.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26587038>Genetic Variants in the SAMM50 Gene Create Susceptibility to Nonalcoholic   Disease in a Chinese Han Population.</a></h1><p>Genome-wide association studies have shown that rs738491, rs2143571, and rs3761472 in the sorting and assembly machinery component 50 homolog (SAMM50) gene are significantly associated with susceptibility to nonalcoholic   disease (NAFLD).The present study evaluated the association between the three genetic variants in the SAMM50 gene and susceptibility to NAFLD in a Chinese Han population.Genotypes for 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), viz rs738491, rs2143571, and rs3761472, in the SAMM50 gene were determined using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction technique in 340 B-type ultrasonography-diagnosed NAFLD patients and 452 healthy controls. Meanwhile, serum lipid profiles and  enzymes were estimated using standard clinical laboratory methods. The SNP-SNP interactions were analyzed by performing multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR).The genotype and allele frequencies of the SAMM50 polymorphisms between the NAFLD group and the control group were significantly different (all  < .05). In the multivariate analysis adjusted for gender, age, and body mass index, the carriers of the rs738491 T allele, rs2143571 A allele, and rs3761472 G allele had significantly increased susceptibility to NAFLD (OR, 1.507; 95% CI, 1.035 to 2.195; P = .032; OR, 1.761; 95% CI, 1.232 to 2.517; P = .002; OR, 1.483; 95% CI, 1.039 to 2.115; P = .030, respectively). Moreover, the rs738491 T allele carriers had significantly higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P = .017) than did the noncarriers. However, differences in the levels of serum triglyceride (TG) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were not statistically significant (P = .123; P = .107). The Rs2143571 A allele and the rs3761472 G allele were both deeply associated with increased levels of serum TG, ALT, and AST (all  < .05). Furthermore, the MDR and GMDR showed that a synergistic relationship might exist between rs738491, rs2143571, and rs3761472 in the SAMM50 gene and the pathophysiology and genetics of NAFLD.We first demonstrated that the rs738491 T allele, rs2143571 A allele, and rs3761472 G allele in the SAMM50 gene created susceptibility to NAFLD in a Chinese Han population. The combination of the three SNPs in the SAMM50 gene may have synergism to predict the predisposition to NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23964455>In vitro cytotoxic activity of Benjakul herbal preparation and its active compounds against human lung, cervical and liver cancer cells.</a></h1><p>Benjakul [BEN], a Thai Traditional medicine preparation, is composed of five plants: Piper chaba fruit [PC], Piper sarmentosum root [], Piper interruptum stem [PI], Plumbago indica root [PL] and Zingiber officinale rhizome [ZO]. From selective interviews of folk doctors in Southern Thailand, it was found that Benjakul has been used for cancer patients.To investigate cytotoxicity activity of Benjakul preparation [BEN] and its ingredients against three human cancer cell lines, large lung carcinoma cell line (COR-L23), cervical cancer cell line (Hela) liver cancer cell line (HepG2) as compared with normal lungfibroblast cell (MRC-5) by using SRB assay.The extraction as imitated the method used by folk doctors was done by maceration in ethanol and boiling in water Bioassay guided isolation was used isolated cytotoxic compound.The ethanolic extracts of PL, ZO, PC, , BEN and  showed specific activity against lung cancer cell (IC50 = 3.4, 7.9, .8, 18.4, 19.8 and 32.91 microg/ml) but all the water extracts had no cytotoxic activity. Three active ingredients [6-gingerol, plumbagin and piperine as .54, 4.18 and 7.48% w/w yield of crude extract respectively] were isolated from the ethanolic extract of BEN and they also showed cytotoxic activity with plumbagin showing the highest cytotoxic activity against COR-L23, HepG2, Hela and MRC-5 (IC50 = 2.55, 2.61, 4.16 and 11.54 microM respectively).These data results may support the Thai traditional doctors who are using Benjakul to treat cancer patients and three of its constituents (6-gingerol, plumbagin and piperine) are suggested to be used as biomarkers for standardization of this preparation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20197195>Impact of dietary fat type within the context of altered cholesterol homeostasis on cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism in the F1B hamster.</a></h1><p>Cholesterol status and dietary fat alter several metabolic pathways reflected in lipoprotein profiles. To assess plasma lipoprotein response and mechanisms by which cholesterol and dietary fat type regulate expression of genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism, we developed an experimental model system using F1B hamsters fed diets (12 weeks) enriched in 10% (wt/wt) coconut, olive, or safflower oil with either high cholesterol (.1%; cholesterol supplemented) or low cholesterol coupled with cholesterol-lowering drugs 10 days before killing (.01% cholesterol, .% lovastatin, 2% cholestyramine; cholesterol depleted). Irrespective of dietary fat, cholesterol depletion, relative to supplementation, resulted in lower plasma non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations (all  < .05). In the , these differences were associated with higher sterol regulatory element binding protein-2, low-density lipoprotein receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and 7α-hydroxylase messenger RNA (mRNA) levels; higher scavenger receptor B1 and apolipoprotein A-I mRNA and protein levels; lower apolipoprotein E protein levels; and in intestine, modestly lower sterol transporters adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) A1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 mRNA levels. Irrespective of cholesterol status, coconut oil, relative to olive and safflower oils, resulted in higher non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations (both  < .05) and modestly higher sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 mRNA levels. These data suggest that, in F1B hamsters, differences in plasma lipoprotein profiles in response to cholesterol depletion are associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, whereas the effect of dietary fat type on gene expression was modest, which limits the usefulness of the experimental animal model.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To test this hypothesis, we measured the diffusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed in the mitochondrial matrix of fibroblast, , skeletal muscle, and epithelial cell lines. Spot photobleaching of GFP with a 100x objective (.8-micron spot diam) gave half-times for fluorescence recovery of -19 ms with >90% of the GFP mobile. As predicted for aqueous-phase diffusion in a confined compartment, fluorescence recovery was slowed or abolished by increased laser spot size or bleach time, and by paraformaldehyde fixation. Quantitative analysis of bleach data using a mathematical model of matrix diffusion gave GFP diffusion coefficients of 2-3 x 10(-7) cm2/s, only three to fourfold less than that for GFP diffusion in water. In contrast, little recovery was found for bleaching of GFP in fusion with subunits of the  acid beta-oxidation multienzyme complex that are normally present in the matrix. Measurement of the rotation of unconjugated GFP by time-resolved anisotropy gave a rotational correlation time of 23.3 +/- 1 ns, similar to that of 20 ns for GFP rotation in water. A rapid rotational correlation time of 325  was also found for a small fluorescent probe (BCECF, approximately .5 kD) in the matrix of isolated  mitochondria. The rapid and unrestricted diffusion of solutes in the mitochondrial matrix suggests that metabolite channeling may not be required to overcome diffusive barriers. We propose that the clustering of matrix enzymes in membrane-associated complexes might serve to establish a relatively uncrowded aqueous space in which solutes can freely diffuse.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18182048>Lipidomic analysis of the retina in a rat model of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome: alterations in docosahexaenoic acid content of phospholipid molecular species.</a></h1><p>Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a complex hereditary disease caused by an enzymatic defect in the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Progressive retinal degeneration occurs in an AY9944-induced rat model of SLOS, with biochemical and electroretinographic hallmarks comparable with the human disease. We evaluated alterations in the non-sterol lipid components of the retina in this model, compared with age-matched controls, using lipidomic analysis. The levels of 16:-22:6 and 18:-22:6 phosphatidylcholine molecular species in retinas were less by > 50% and > 33%, respectively, in rats treated for either 2 or 3 months with AY9944. Relative to controls, AY9944 treatment resulted in > 60% less di-22:6 and > % less 18:-22:6 phosphatidylethanolamine molecular species. The predominant phosphatidylserine () molecular species in control retinas were 18:-22:6 and di-22:6; notably, AY9944 treatment resulted in > 80% less di-22:6 , relative to controls. Remarkably, these changes occurred in the absence of n3  acid deficiency in plasma or . Thus, the retinal lipidome is globally altered in the SLOS rat model, relative to control rats, with the most profound changes being less phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and  molecular species containing docosahexaenoic acid (22:6). These findings suggest that SLOS may involve additional metabolic compromise beyond the primary enzymatic defect in the cholesterol pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24364104>[Changes of serum aminotransferase in children with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome].</a></h1><p>Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are both strongly associated with . Whether OSAHS is an independent risk factor for liver injury or not is uncertain. To assess the hypothesis that OSAHS is associated with liver injury independent of .One hundred and thirty children with OSAHS and 77 children with primary snoring() were enrolled. Polysomnography was performed. Body mass index (BMI), liver function tests, serum lipids, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and insulin (INS) were measured.Seventeen children of OSAHS had elevated serum aminotransferase levels,while only 2 children of non-OSAHS had elevated serum aminotransferase in healthy control group (chi2 = 5.18, P < .05; OR = 5.64 CI 1.27-24.97). Fifteen children of obese had elevated serum aminotransferase levels, while only 4 children had elevated serum aminotransferase in non-obese group (chi2 = 4.58, P < .05; (OR = 1.97 CI 1.06-3.67). Seventy cases of obese children,  cases of elevated aminotransferase levels (21.4%), namely fatty liver patients, of these children, 14 had OSAHS (93.3%). In contrast, OSAHS was present in only 67.3% of obese children without elevated aminotransferase.OSAHS may be a risk factor for liver injury independent of ; Increased liver enzyme levels are frequently found in obese snoring children, particularly among those with OSAHS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18843462>Effect of simvastatin on steroid-induced osteonecrosis evidenced by the serum lipid level and hepatic cytochrome P4503A in a rabbit model.</a></h1><p>This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of lipid-lowering agents in preventing steroid-induced osteonecrosis and the mechanism by which they do so in a rabbit model.Female Japanese white rabbits were randomly allocated to receive probucol (group P), pravastatin (group ), simvastatin (group SS), or saline (group C) for 6 weeks (n =  in groups P, , and SS; n = 30 in group C). Methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg) was injected at 3 weeks after starting treatment, and the femurs were histologically examined bilaterally 3 weeks after methylprednisolone injection. Midazolam clearance was measured before treatment and before methylprednisolone injection to determine hepatic cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) levels.The incidence of osteonecrosis in the proximal metaphysis of the femurs in groups  and SS was significantly lower than in group C (P < .05 and P < .0001, respectively), whereas it did not differ between groups P and C. It was significantly lower in group SS than in group  (P < .05). Plasma concentrations of lipids (low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, free  acid, and total cholesterol) in groups P, , and SS were significantly lower than in group C; and hepatic CYP3A levels were significantly higher in group SS than in groups P or  after treatment (P < .005 for both).Simvastatin and pravastatin significantly reduced the incidence of steroid-induced osteonecrosis in rabbits. Simvastatin was more effective in reducing the incidence of the disease, and increased CYP3A activity is a possible mechanism for this effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25772036>Sarcopaenia is associated with NAFLD independently of  and insulin resistance: Nationwide surveys (KNHANES 2008-2011).</a></h1><p>Although sarcopaenia is associated with -related comorbidities, its influence on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or steatohepatitis has not been fully determined. We aimed to investigate the direct relationship between sarcopaenia and NAFLD or steatohepatitis in the general population.We conducted a cross-sectional study using nationally representative samples of ,132 subjects from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2008-2011. Subjects were defined as having NAFLD when they had higher scores from previously validated NAFLD prediction models such as the hepatic steatosis index, comprehensive NAFLD score and NAFLD liver fat score. BARD and FIB-4 scores were used to define advanced fibrosis in subjects with NAFLD. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) [SMI(%)=total appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg)/weight (kg)×100] measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to diagnose sarcopaenia with cut points of 32.2% for men and 25.5% for women.SMI was inversely correlated with all NAFLD predicting scores (<.001). After stratification, sarcopaenic subjects had an increased risk of NAFLD regardless of  (odds ratios [ORs]=1.55 to 3.02, depending on models; all <.001) or metabolic syndrome (ORs=1.63 to 4.00, all <.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis also demonstrated this independent association between sarcopaenia and NAFLD after adjusting for confounding factors related to  or insulin resistance (ORs=1.18 to 1.22, all <.001). Furthermore, among the NAFLD population, subjects with lower SMIs were likely to have advanced fibrosis compared with non-sarcopaenic individuals (BARD and FIB-4: ORs=1.83 and 1.69, respectively; both <.001). Compared with non-exercised subjects, individuals who exercised regularly had a lower risk of NAFLD (p<.001), particularly among obese people with well-preserved muscle mass.Sarcopaenia is associated with increased risks of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, independent of  or metabolic control.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Seventy-five male Golden Syrian hamsters, weighing 100 to 120 g, were fed a regular rodent chow for 2 weeks before being randomly assigned into 5 groups of  animals each fed semisynthetic diets for 4 weeks. Group 1 was given a control diet that contained .25% cholesterol and 5% fat with a polyunsaturated to saturated  acids ratio of .4. Groups 2 to 5 were fed the control diet and given 25 mg/kg BW per day of VLCFA (Licowax) (VLCFA25), 50 mg/kg BW per day of VLCFA (VLCFA50), 25 mg/kg BW per day of VLCFA+1000 mg/kg BW per day of LT (VLCFA25/LT), and 25 mg/kg BW per day of VLCFA+1000 mg/kg BW per day of  (Cholestatin, VLCFA25/), respectively. Results showed that HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were not changed by VLCFA25, although increased by VLCFA50 (P<.05) relative to control. Total cholesterol (T-C) and non-HDL-C levels were not affected by VLCFA25 and VLCFA50 as compared with control. VLCFA25/LT had higher (P<.02) T-C and HDL-C levels than any other treatments and increased (P<.05)  weight relative to control. In contrast, VLCFA25/ reduced T-C (P=.0004) and non-HDL-C (P=.007) without effect on HDL-C levels compared with control. Triglyceride levels were not affected by any treatment. Cholesterol biosynthesis rate was higher (P<.05) in animals fed VLCFA25 and VLCFA50 than those fed control or VLCFA25/LT or VLCFA25/. Results suggest that PSs can decrease total and non-HDL-C cholesterol, whereas VLCFA may increase HDL-C in hamsters.</p></html>
