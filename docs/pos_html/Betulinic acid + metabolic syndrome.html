It is found in different plant organs, both as a free aglycon and as glycosyl derivatives. A wide range of pharmacological activities has been described for this triterpenoid, including antiviral and antitumor effects. In addition, several other interesting properties have been identified in the fields of immunity and metabolism, namely antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Taken together, these latter three properties make  a highly interesting prospect for treating metabolic syndrome. The present review focuses on the therapeutic potential of this agent, along with several of its semisynthetic derivatives, which could open new frontiers in the use of natural product-based medicines.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30288995> improves insulin sensitivity, hyperglycemia, inflammation and oxidative stress in metabolic syndrome rats via PI3K/Akt pathways.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the influence of  on high-fructose diet-induced metabolic syndrome in rats. Oral administration of  significantly reversed high-fructose diet-mediated increase in body mass index and blood glucose. Furthermore,  restored high-fructose diet-mediated alterations in metabolic hormones (insulin, leptin and adiponectin). -mediated upregulation of protein kinase B (Akt) and phosphoinositde-3 kinase (PI3K) anulled high-fructose diet mediated depletion. Also, elevated tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and -8 were significantly lowered. Administration of  restored high-fructose diet-mediated increase in the levels of lipid profile parameters and indices of atherosclerosis, cardiac and cardiovascular diseases. High-fructose diet-mediated decrease in activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and increase in oxidative stress biomarkers (reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation products, protein oxidation and fragmented DNA) were significantly restored by the phenolic acids. Conclusively,  improves insulin sensitivity, elevated blood glucose, inflammation and dyslipidaemia and oxidative stress in high-fructose diet-induced metabolic syndrome through the PI#Kand Akt pathways .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29606968>The effect of  on leptin, adiponectin, hepatic enzyme levels and lipid profiles in streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is developed by lack of insulin secretion or reduction of tissues sensitivity to insulin, which lead to serious complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate antihyperlipidemic effect of  (BA) on streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NA) induced diabetic mice. In this experimental study, seventy adult male NMRI mice (20-25 g) were divided randomly into seven groups ( = 10) of control, sham, diabetes, diabetes + BA (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg), and diabetes + metformin (200 mg/kg). Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a single dose of STZ (50 mg/kg) 15 min after an i.p. administration of nicotinamide (NA) (120 mg/kg). BA and metformin were orally administered and after two weeks blood samples were taken. Blood levels of leptin, adiponectin, lipid profile and liver enzyme were then measured. One day after the last drug administration, liver was removed to evaluate the histological changes. A significant increase ( < 0.05) in the plasma levels of leptin, alanine-aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), cholesterol, and a significant decrease in adiponectin and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were observed in diabetic mice. The groups treated with BA indicated a significant decrease in leptin, AST, ALT, ALP, TG, cholesterol, LDL-C and an increases in adiponectin and HDL levels, while VLDL did not show significant changes. BA was found to have positive effects on liver injury. BA has an effective role on liver damage induced by diabetes through amelioration of leptin, adiponectin, liver enzyme levels and lipid profile. Since BA has a positive effect on lipid profile, adiponectin and leptin, it may improve metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30635917> alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease through activation of farnesoid X receptors in mice.</a></h2><p>The molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains elusive. Both farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signalling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contribute to the progression of NAFLD; however, it is not clear whether the actions of these two pathways are dependent on each other. Moreover, the pharmacological benefits and mechanism of  (BA) in controlling metabolic syndrome and NAFLD are largely unknown.A reporter assay and a time-resolved FRET assay were used to identify BA as an agonist of the FXR. NAFLD was induced by a methionine and choline-deficient L-amino acid diet (MCD) and high-fat diet (HFD). The pharmacological effects of BA (100 mg·kg ·day ) and potential interactions between hepatic FXR activation and ER stress pathways were evaluated by FXR silencing, Western blot and RT-PCR analyses using control and FXR mice.Activation of the FXR inhibited intracellular PERK/EIF2α/ATF4 and CHOP signalling, thereby alleviating hepatic ER stress, whereas FXR silencing resulted in an opposite effect. Furthermore, we identified BA as an FXR agonist that effectively attenuated the progression of NAFLD and metabolic disorders in both HFD- and MCD diet-fed mice and restored the hepatocellular ER homeostasis by stimulating the FXR signalling pathway and blocking PERK/EIF2α signalling. In contrast, the effects of BA were attenuated in FXR mice.Our data demonstrate that pharmacological activation of the FXR by BA reduces hepatocellular ER stress and attenuates NAFLD in an animal model of hepatic steatosis.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p></html>
