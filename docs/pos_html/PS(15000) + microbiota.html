The excretion percentage of animal sterols (AS) (67-73%) is considerably greater than that of  (27-33%) in feces from healthy humans following a Western diet. However, a lower content of AS in feces from subjects following a vegetarian, vegan or low-fat animal diet has been seen when compared to omnivorous subjects. Although only one human study has reported fecal sterol excretion after the consumption of -enriched food (8.6 g /day), it was found that the target group showed an increase in the excretion of cholesterol and a 57% decrease in its metabolites compared to the control group.Evaluation of the impact of a -enriched milk based fruit beverage intake on fecal sterol excretion and the microbial conversion of sterols in postmenopausal women with mild hypercholesterolemia.Forty postmenopausal women participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study with two beverages, with a -enriched (2 g /day) or without. The women were divided in two groups: 20 women consumed the -enriched beverage and the other 20 women consumed a placebo (without ) beverage for 6 weeks. After a four-week washout period, the type of beverage was exchanged and consumed for another 6 weeks. Feces were collected at the start ( and 10 weeks) and end of each intervention period (6 and 16 weeks), and fecal sterols were determined by capillary gas chromatography with mass spectrometry.The intake of the -enriched beverage modified the fecal sterol excretion profile. A significant increase mainly in  and their metabolites versus the placebo intervention period was observed. Although the same effect was not observed in the case of AS, a tendency towards increased cholesterol and decreased coprostanol (the main metabolite of cholesterol) was recorded after -enriched beverage intake versus placebo. Furthermore, the -enriched beverage also modified the microbial conversion of sterols. In this context, an important decrease in the conversion percentage of cholesterol in 16 women (between 11% and 50%) and of sitosterol in 24 women (between % and 61%) was observed.The results obtained suggest that the  could preferably use  as a substrate, when present in a greater proportion compared with cholesterol. Besides, a lower sitosterol and cholesterol conversion trend would mean that intake of the -enriched beverage could modulate the metabolic activity of the gut . Therefore, further studies on the impact of -enriched foods upon gut  modulation are needed. Clinical Trial Registry Number:  listed on the NIH website: ClinicalTrials.gov.

The present study investigated the effect of a daily lacto-fermented sauerkraut supplement in relation to IBS patients' gastrointestinal symptoms and gut  composition. A randomized double-blinded intervention was conducted with 34 Norwegian IBS patients. The patients were consuming either pasteurized sauerkraut (; n = ) or unpasteurized sauerkraut (UPS; n = 19) as a supplement to their daily diet for 6 weeks. The differences in change of symptoms were assessed using the questionnaire IBS-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) measured at the baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 (follow-up). The gut  composition was analysed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of faecal samples from the baseline and week 6. The mean change in IBS-SSS was -38.57 ± 17.08  vs. -56.99 ± 16.92 UPS and was significantly improved in both groups (P < .04), while the improvement in symptoms was not different between the intervention groups. The sauerkraut intervention (pasteurized or not) also led to significant gut  compositional changes as determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (un-weighted UniFrac: P = .001, weighted UniFrac: P = .001). Sauerkraut related LAB in feces (Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus brevis) were significantly more often present in the UPS-group. In conclusion lacto-fermented sauerkraut had an effect on IBS patients' symptoms and gut  even though the study was underpowered. Our results indicate that the observed effect to a larger extent can be attributed to the potential prebiotics in lacto-fermented sauerkraut rather than the viable LAB. Future studies with greater statistical power are needed to clarify the possible effects of LAB from lacto-fermented sauerkraut in the treatment of IBS patients.</p></html>
