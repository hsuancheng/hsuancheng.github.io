During the past decade, microorganisms that inhabit the  have emerged as contributors to the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, manipulation of the human  microbiota will provide essential clues regarding new therapeutic targets for diabetes.Several studies have established the presence of  dysbiosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, even though there are some differences among the studies that could be explained by differences in ethnicity, diet, and methodology.  dysbiosis affects the quality and quantity of short-chain fatty  and secondary bile  that act as signaling molecules in energy, glucose, and lipid metabolism. In addition,  dysbiosis affect intestinal permeability. In particular, a high-fat diet can lead to changes in the  microbiota that strongly reduce intestinal permeability due to the malfunction of tight junction proteins, such as occludin and ZO-1 [<citeref rid="ref1">1</citeref>]. The formation of   results in increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide, which activate Toll-like receptor 4 and result in innate and adaptive immune responses [<citeref rid="ref2">2</citeref>]. Key messages:  dysbiosis play an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes, for example, via chronic low-grade inflammation. Normalizing  dysbiosis could be a new approach to overcome diseases of insulin resistance, such as diabetes mellitus.© 2017 S.

Increased IgM-related autoimmune responses to oxidative specific epitopes (OSEs), including malondialdehyde (MDA), oleic  and phosphatidyl inositol (Pi), and nitroso-(NO)-adducts, including NO-tryptophan (NOW), NO-arginine and NO-cysteinyl, are frequently observed in ME/CFS. Autoimmune responses in ME/CFS may be driven by increased bacterial translocation as measured by IgM and IgA responses to LPS of gram negative bacteria.The aim of this study is to examine whether IgM responses to OSEs and NO-adducts are related to a better outcome as measured by the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Rating Scale (FF). 76 ME/CFS patients with initially abnormal autoimmune responses were treated with care-as-usual, including nutraceuticals with anti-IO&NS effects (NAIOS), such as L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, taurine + lipoic , with or without curcumine + quercitine or N-acetyl-cysteine, zinc + glutamine.We found that use of these NAIOS was associated with highly significant reductions in initially increased IgM-mediated autoimmune responses to OSEs and NO-adducts. A greater reduction in autoimmune responses to OSEs during intake of these NAIOS was associated with a lower FF score. Reductions in IgM responses to oleic , MDA and Pi, but not in any of the NO-adducts, were associated with reductions in severity of illness. These associations remained significant after adjusting for possible effects of increased bacterial translocation ( ).Our results show that autoimmune responses to OSEs are involved in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS and that these pathways are a new drug target in a subgroup of ME/CFS patients. Although hypernitrosylation and nitrosative stress play a role in ME/CFS, reductions in these pathways are not associated with lowered severity of illness. Randomized controlled trials with NAIOS should be carried out in the subgroup of ME/CFS patients with initially increased autoimmune responses to OSEs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22671585>Charge-selective claudin channels.</a></h1><p>Claudins are the main determinants of barrier properties of the tight junction. Many claudins have been shown to act by tightening the paracellular pathway, but several function as paracellular channels. While some depend on the endogenous claudin background of the analyzed cell line, for other claudins, a distinct charge-selectivity has been shown. This paper portrays cation-selective (claudin-2, claudin-10b, claudin-15) and anion-selective (claudin-10a, claudin-17) claudins and claudins with debatable channel properties (claudin-4, claudin-7, claudin-16). It also describes molecular properties determining the observed charge-selectivity and pore properties in general. In  tissues, they widely determine overall transport characteristics by providing paracellular ion-selective pathways. In small intestine, claudin-2 and claudin-15 replace each other in the developing . In kidney proximal tubules, claudin-2, claudin-10, and claudin-17 allow for paracellular reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and water.© 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27730676>New biomarkers for increased intestinal permeability induced by dextran sodium sulphate and fasting in chickens.</a></h1><p>Increased intestinal permeability (IP) can lead to compromised health in chickens. As there is limited literature on in vivo biomarkers to assess increased IP in chickens, the objective of this study was to identify a reliable biomarker of IP using DSS ingestion and fasting models. Male Ross chickens (n = 48) were reared until day 14 on the floor pen in an animal care facility, randomized into the following groups: control, DSS and fasting (each with n = 16), and then placed in metabolism cages. DSS was administered in drinking water at 0.75% from days 16 to 21, while controls and fasted groups received water. All birds had free access to feed and water except the birds in the fasting group that were denied feed for 19.5 h on day 20. On day 21, all chickens were given two separate oral gavages comprising fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d, 2.2 mg in 1 ml/bird) at time zero and lactulose, mannitol and rhamnose (LMR) sugars (0.25 g L, 0.05 g M and 0.05 g R in 2 ml/bird) at 60 min. Whole blood was collected from the brachial vein in a syringe 90 min post-LMR sugar gavage. Serum FITC-d and plasma LMR sugar concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry and high-performance ion chromatography respectively. Plasma concentrations of intestinal fatty  binding protein, diamine oxidase, tight junction protein (TJP), d-lactate and faecal α-antitrypsin inhibitor concentration were also analysed by ELISA. FITC-d increased significantly (p < 0.05) after fasting compared with control. L/M and L/R ratios for fasting and L/M ratio for DSS increased compared with control chickens (p < 0.05). TJP in plasma was significantly increased due to fasting but not DSS treatment, compared with controls. Other tests did not indicate changes in IP (p > 0.05). We concluded that FITC-d and LMR sugar tests can be used in chickens to assess changes in IP.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999787>Probing paracellular - transcellular tissue barrier permeability using a  mucosal explant culture system.</a></h1><p>Intestinal permeation enhancers (PEs), i.e. agents improving oral delivery of therapeutic drugs with poor bioavailability, may typically act by two principally different mechanisms: to increase either transcellular -or paracellular passage across the epithelium. With the aim to define these different modes of action in a small intestinal mucosal explant system, the transcellular-acting PE sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was compared to the paracellular-acting PE ethylenediaminetetraacetic  (EDTA), using several fluorescent polar - and lipophilic probes. Here, SDS rendered the enterocyte cell membranes  for the relatively small polar tracers Lucifer yellow and a 3 kD Texas red-conjugated dextran, but most conspicuously SDS blocked constitutive endocytosis from the brush border. In contrast, the main action of EDTA was to increase paracellular passage across the epithelium of both polar probes, including 10 - and 70 kDa dextrans and lipophilic probes, visualized by distinct stripy lateral staining of enterocytes and/or accumulation in the lamina propria. In addition, EDTA caused a loss of epithelial cell polarity by opening tight junctions for diffusion of domain-specific basolateral/apical cell membrane protein markers into the opposite domains. By transmission electron microscopy, SDS caused the formation of vacuoles and vesicle-like structures at the lateral cell membranes. In contrast, EDTA led to a bulging of the whole enterocyte apex, resulting in a "cobblestone" appearance of the epithelium, probably caused by an extreme contraction of the perijunctional actomyosin ring. We conclude that the mucosal explant system is a convenient model for predicting transcellular/paracellular modes of action of novel prospective PEs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22179430>  in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and inactive ulcerative colitis.</a></h1><p>Defective epithelial barrier has been implicated in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate  permeability in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis (UC) and in patients with IBS.IBS patients of the diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D) and of the constipation-predominant subgroup (IBS-C), patients with inactive UC and healthy subjects were enrolled.  permeability was evaluated by measuring 24-hour urine excretion of orally administered (51)Cr-EDTA. Clinical symptoms were evaluated in IBS-D patients and correlated to colonic permeability.There was a significant decrease in the proximal small intestinal permeability in IBS-C patients compared to controls (0.26 ± 0.05 vs. 0.63 ± 0.1%; p < 0.05). Distal small intestinal permeability showed no significant difference in the studied group of patients compared to controls. Colonic permeability of IBS-D and inactive UC patients was significantly increased compared to controls (2.68 ± 0.35 and 3.74 ± 0.49 vs. 1.04 ± 0.18%; p < 0.05, p < 0.001). Colonic permeability of IBS-D patients correlated with stool frequency.Elevated  permeability is localized to the colon both in IBS-D and in inactive UC patients.Copyright © 2011 S.

Women with RPL show higher prevalence of undiagnosed  disorders. Furthermore, in endometrial tissues of RPL women, higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Nalp-3 inflammasome has been observed. Aim of this study was to investigate whether an abnormal  permeability might occur in RPL women and allow passage into systemic circulation of pro-inflammatory molecules able to induce endometrial inflammation.70 women with idiopathic RPL and 30 healthy women were recruited at the Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Outpatient Unit of the Gemelli Hospital of Rome from March 2013 to February 2017. Enrolled women underwent Cr-ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic  absorption test to evaluate intestinal permeability. Sera obtained from enrolled women were analysed for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by ELISA. Anxiety and depression state were evaluated by administering STAI-Y and Zung-SDS tests, respectively. Of all recruited individuals, 35 women with idiopathic RPL and 20 healthy controls accepted to undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy. Endometrial lysates were investigated for inflammasome Nalp-3 by Western blot analysis, and caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18 by ELISA, respectively.Higher prevalence of abnormal intestinal permeability (P < 0.0001), increased circulating levels of LPS (P < 0.05), anxiety (P < 0.05) and depression (P < 0.05) were observed in RLP women compared to controls. Endometrial expression of Nalp-3, caspase-1 and IL-1β was significantly increased in RPL group (P < 0.0001; P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). IL-18 endometrial levels were not found to be higher in RPL cases. Statistically significant association between higher intestinal permeability and abnormally increased expression of endometrial Nalp-3, was observed in RPL (P < 0.01). Furthermore, higher LPS serum levels, a bacterial-derived activator of Nalp-3 complex, was shown to be statistically associated to abnormal endometrial expression of Nalp-3 inflammasome (P < 0.01) in RPL women.In women with RLP,   might occur and allow passage into circulation of immune triggers, potentially able to elicit endometrial innate immune response and, thus, to contribute to miscarriage pathogenesis.

Exposure of macrophages to low doses of LPS causes hyporesponsiveness upon subsequent endotoxin challenge, a phenomenon termed endotoxin or LPS tolerance. In the present study, we aimed to examine whether LPS-induced lipid accumulation is affected by endotoxin tolerance. LPS pretreatment reduced the expression of proinflammatory mediators upon subsequent high-dose LPS treatment in murine livers. Total lipid and lipid class analysis indicated that LPS-induced lipid accumulation was not affected by endotoxin tolerance, although it was dependent on the presence of Kupffer cells. Analysis of the expression of lipogenic genes revealed that sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1) and its target ELOVL fatty  elongase 6 (Elovl6) were upregulated upon LPS administration in livers from LPS-tolerant and non-tolerant mice, whereas the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (Ppara), a key inducer of lipid degradation, was decreased. Neither Interleukin (IL)-6 expression nor the activation of its downstream effector signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 were suppressed in liver tissues of LPS-tolerized mice. In vitro experiments confirmed that recombinant or macrophage-derived IL-6 was a potent activator of the lipogenic factor STAT3 in hepatocytes. Accordingly, IL-6 treatment led to increased lipid levels in this cell type. In summary, our data show that endotoxin tolerance does not influence LPS-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and suggest that IL-6 drives hepatic lipid storage.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

MT-1, the most functional and active MT in humans, has the ability to react with and enhance the detoxification of a number of metals including zinc, mercury, copper and cadmium. MT dysfunction may result, then, in many of the aetiological syndromes observed in autistic children, such as the  . It has been proposed that allergic autoimmune reactions occurring after exposure to heavy metals, may contribute to some symptoms associated with autism. Therefore abnormalities in MT concentration and/or structure, as well as the presence of anti-MT antibodies, may be associated with autism. We used direct ELISAs to quantitate the concentration of serum anti-metallothionein IgG in 66 individuals (parents and children) from 14 families with autistic children, as well as 11 controls from families with no history of autism. We measured the concentration of serum metallothionein in 39 of the above family members from 8 families. Our results indicate that a significantly high number (23 of 66) of autistic family members had high levels of anti-metallothionein IgG, when compared to controls (1 ) and the production of these antibodies correlated with levels of metallothionein, suggesting that the production of these antibodies is inherited. However, the presence of these antibodies does not correlate with autism, types of autism, including regression, or demographics such as allergies, respiratory problems or GI disease. This suggests that the presence of anti-metallothionein antibodies is not causative to autism and may be the result of other immunological pathology seen in many autistics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28571979>Impact of high-fat diet on the intestinal microbiota and small intestinal physiology before and after the onset of obesity.</a></h1><p>The modulation of the intestinal microbiota by high-fat diet (HFD) has a major impact on both immunological and metabolic functions of the host. Taking this into consideration, the aim of this contribution is to review the impact of HFD on microbiota profile and small intestinal physiology before and after the onset of obesity and its metabolic complications. Evidence from animal studies suggest that before the onset of obesity and its metabolic complications, HFD induces intestinal dysbiosis - encompassing changes in composition balance and massive redistribution with bacteria occupying intervillous spaces and crypts - associated with early physiopathological changes, predominantly in the ileum, such as low-grade inflammation, decreased antimicrobial peptides expression, impaired mucus production, secretion and layer's thickness, and decreased expression of tight junction proteins. With time, major inflammatory signals (e.g. toll-like receptor-4 dependent) become activated, thereby stimulating proinflammatory cytokines secretion in the small intestine. This inflammatory state might subsequently exacerbate disruption of the mucus layer barrier and increase epithelial permeability of the small intestine, thereby creating an environment that facilitates the passage of bacterial components (e.g. lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan and flagellin) and metabolites from the intestinal lumen (e.g. secondary bile ) to the circulation and peripheral tissues (i.e.  ), eventually promoting the development of systemic inflammation, obesity, adiposity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance preceding hyperglycemia. Although the mechanisms are still not completely understood, prebiotics, probiotics, polyphenols, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonists (such as rosiglitazone) and exercise have been shown to reverse HFD-induced intestinal phenotype and to attenuate the severity of obesity and its associated metabolic complications.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

This role is mainly effected by the readily reversible nitrosylation of selective protein cysteine thiols. The reversibility and sophistication of this signaling system is enabled and regulated by a number of enzymes which form part of the thioredoxin, glutathione, and pyridoxine antioxidant systems. Increases in nitric oxide levels initially lead to a defensive increase in the number of nitrosylated proteins in an effort to preserve their function. However, in an environment of chronic oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), nitrosylation of crucial cysteine groups within key enzymes of the thioredoxin, glutathione, and pyridoxine systems leads to their inactivation thereby disabling denitrosylation and transnitrosylation and subsequently a state described as "hypernitrosylation." This state leads to the development of pathology in multiple domains such as the inhibition of enzymes of the electron transport chain, decreased mitochondrial function, and altered conformation of proteins and amino  leading to loss of immune tolerance and development of autoimmunity. Hypernitrosylation also leads to altered function or inactivation of proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis, autophagy, proteomic degradation, transcription factor activity, immune-inflammatory pathways, energy production, and neural function and survival. Hypernitrosylation, as a consequence of chronically elevated O&NS and activated immune-inflammatory pathways, can explain many characteristic abnormalities observed in neuroprogressive disease including major depression and chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis. In those disorders, increased bacterial translocation may drive hypernitrosylation and autoimmune responses against nitrosylated proteins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076401> : mechanisms, measurement and clinical implications in humans.</a></h1><p>The objectives of this review on ' ' for clinicians are to discuss the components of the intestinal barrier, the diverse measurements of intestinal permeability, their perturbation in non-inflammatory 'stressed states' and the impact of treatment with dietary factors. Information on 'healthy' or ''  in the public domain requires confirmation before endorsing dietary exclusions, replacement with non-irritating foods (such as fermented foods) or use of supplements to repair the damage. The intestinal barrier includes surface mucus, epithelial layer and immune defences. Epithelial permeability results from increased paracellular transport, apoptosis or transcellular permeability. Barrier function can be tested in vivo using orally administered probe molecules or in vitro using mucosal biopsies from humans, exposing the colonic mucosa from rats or mice or cell layers to extracts of colonic mucosa or stool from human patients. Assessment of intestinal barrier requires measurements beyond the epithelial layer. 'Stress' disorders such as endurance exercise, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs administration, pregnancy and surfactants (such as bile  and dietary factors such as emulsifiers) increase permeability. Dietary factors can reverse intestinal leakiness and mucosal damage in the 'stress' disorders. Whereas inflammatory or ulcerating intestinal diseases result in  , no such disease can be cured by simply normalising intestinal barrier function. It is still unproven that restoring barrier function can ameliorate clinical manifestations in GI or systemic diseases. Clinicians should be aware of the potential of barrier dysfunction in GI diseases and of the barrier as a target for future therapy.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

It is well known that  mycotoxins will lead a breakdown of the normally impeccable epithelial barrier, resulting in the development of a "" . H administration with different methods has been proved definitely potentials to prevent serious intestinal diseases. The goal of this study is to investigate the roles of lactulose (LAC) and hydrogen-rich water (HRW) in preventing intestinal dysfunction in piglets fed  mycotoxin-contaminated feed.A total of 24 female piglets were evenly assigned to 4 groups: negative control (NC) group, mycotoxin-contaminated (MC) feed group, MC feed with LAC treatment (MC + LAC), and MC feed with HRW treatment (MC + HRW), respectively. Piglets in the NC group were fed uncontaminated control diet, while remaining piglets were fed  mycotoxin-contaminated diet. For the NC and MC groups, 10 mL/kg body weight (BW) of hydrogen-free water (HFW) was orally administrated to piglets twice daily; while in the MC + LAC and MC + HRW groups, piglets were treated with the same dose of LAC solution (500 mg/kg BW) and HRW twice daily, respectively. On d 25, serum was collected and used for biochemical analysis. Intestinal tissues were sampled for morphological examination as well as relative genes and protein expression analysis.Our data showed that  mycotoxins induced higher serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activities ( 0.05), -lactic  levels ( 0.01), and endotoxin status ( 0.01), lower villus height ( 0.01) and ratio of villus height to crypt depth ( 0.05) in small intestine, greater apoptosis index and higher mRNA expression related to tight junctions ( 0.05). In addition, the distribution and down-regulation of claudin-3 (CLDN3) protein in the small intestinal was also observed. As expected, oral administrations of HRW and LAC were found to remarkably provide beneficial effects against  mycotoxin-induced apoptosis and intestinal leaking. Moreover, either HRW or LAC treatments were also revealed to prevent abnormal intestinal morphological changes, disintegrate tight junctions, and restore the expression and distribution of CLDN3 protein in the small intestinal mucosal layer in female piglets that were fed  mycotoxins contaminated diet.Our data suggest that orally administrations of HRW and LAC result in less  mycotoxin-induced apoptosis and leak in the small intestine. Either HRW or LAC treatments could prevent the abnormal changes of intestinal morphology and molecular response of tight junctions as well as restore the distribution and expression of CLDN3 protein of small intestinal mucosa layer in female piglets that were fed  mycotoxins contaminated diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29034530>Gene expression and morphological changes in the intestinal mucosa associated with increased permeability induced by short-term fasting in chickens.</a></h1><p>Short-term fasting for 4.5 and 9 hr has been demonstrated to increase intestinal permeability (IP) in chickens. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 0, 4.5, 9 and 19.5 hr fasting on intestinal gene expression and villus-crypt architecture of enterocytes in jejunal and ileal samples. On day 38, Ross-308 male birds were fasted according to their group and then euthanised. Two separate intestinal sections (each 2 cm long, jejunum and ileum) were collected. One section was utilised for villus height and crypt depth measurements. The second section was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of tight junction proteins (TJP) including claudin-1, claudin-3, occludin, zonula occludens (ZO-1, ZO-2), junctional adhesion molecules (JAM) and E-cadherin. Additionally genes involved in enterocyte protection including glucagon-like peptide (GLP-2), heat-shock protein (HSP-70), intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), toll-like receptors (TLR-4), mucin (MUC-2), cluster differentiation (CD-36) and fatty -binding protein (FABP-6) were also analysed. Normally distributed data were analysed using one-way analysis of variance ANOVA. Other data were analysed by non-parametric one-way ANOVA. Villus height and crypt depth were increased (p < .05) only in the ileum after fasting for 4.5 and 9 hr compared with non-fasting group. mRNA expression of claudin-3 was significantly reduced in the ileum of birds fasted for 9 and 19.5 hr, suggesting a role in IP modulation. However, all other TJP genes examined were not statistically different from control. Nevertheless, ileal FABP-6 of all fasted groups was significantly reduced, which could possibly be due to reduced bile  production during fasting.© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29306937>The Effects of Stress and Meditation on the Immune System, Human Microbiota, and Epigenetics.</a></h1><p>Context • Globally, more than 25% of individuals are affected by anxiety and depression disorders. Meditation is gaining popularity in clinical settings and its treatment efficacy is being studied for a wide array of psychological and physiological ailments. An exploration of stress physiology is an essential precursor to delineation of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of meditation practices. Objective • The review outlines a model of interconnected physiological processes that might support the continued inclusion and expansion of meditation in the treatment of diverse medical conditions and to investigate the role that  microbiota may play in realizing well-being through meditation. Design • The authors conducted a scientific literature database search with the goal of reviewing the link between stress management techniques and human microbiota. Their goal was also to identify the extent of underlying epigenetic reactions in these processes. The review was completed in approximately 2 y. Databases searched included Medline via PubMed and Ovid, PsycINFO via Ovid, Spinet, ProQuest Central, SAGE Research Methods Online, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Science Direct, Springer Link, and Wiley Online Library. Keywords searched included, but were not limited to, stress, meditation, mindfulness, immune system, HPA axis, sympathetic nervous system, parasympathetic nervous system, microbiota, microbiome, -barrier function,  , vagus nerve, psychoneuroimmunology, epigenetic, and NF-κB. Setting • The study took place at New York University (New York, NY, USA), the University of California, San Diego (La Jolla, CA, USA), and the Chopra Foundation (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Results • Psychological stress typically triggers a fight-or-flight response, prompting corticotropin-releasing hormone and catecholamine production in various parts of the body, which ultimately disturbs the microbiota. In the absence of stress, a healthy microbiota produces short-chain fatty  that exert anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects. During stress, an altered  microbial population affects the regulation of neurotransmitters mediated by the microbiome and  barrier function. Meditation helps regulate the stress response, thereby suppressing chronic inflammation states and maintaining a healthy -barrier function. Conclusions • The current research team recommends the integration of meditation into conventional health care and wellness models. Concurrently, studies to explore the effects of meditation on human microbiota are warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25680441>Elevated fecal calprotectin in patients with Alzheimer's dementia indicates  .</a></h1><p>Fecal concentrations of calprotectin were examined in 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and compared with serum concentrations of aromatic amino .

They established the segmented culture technique for localizing the infections in the males to the urethra, the bladder, or the prostate and to differentiate the main categories of prostatitis. Such categories with slight modifications are still used according to the NIH classification: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) and asymptomatic prostatitis. Prostatic inflammation is considered an important factor in influencing both prostatic growth and progression of symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Chronic inflammation/neuroinflammation is a result of a deregulated acute phase response of the innate immune system affecting surrounding neural tissue at molecular, structural and functional levels. Clinical observations suggest that chronic inflammation correlates with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and an history of clinical chronic prostatitis significantly increases the odds for prostate cancer. The NIHNIDDK classification based on the use of the microbiological 4- glasses localization test or simplified 2-glasses test, is currently accepted worldwide. The UPOINT system identifies groups of clinicians with homogeneous clinical presentation and is used to recognize phenotypes to be submitted to specific treatments. The UPOINTS algorithm implemented the original UPOINT adding to the urinary domains (U), psycho-social (P), organspecific (O), infection (I), neurological (N), muscle tension and tenderness (T) a further domain related to sexuality (S). In fact sexual dysfunction (erectile, ejaculatory, libido loss) has been described in 46-92% of cases with a high impact on the quality of life of patients with CP/CPPS. Prostatic ultrasound represents the most popular imaging test in the work-up of either acute and chronic prostatitis although no specific hypo-hyperechoic pattern has been clearly associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis and CPPS. Use of a digital-processing software to calculate the extension of prostatic calcification area at ultrasound demonstrated a higher percentage of prostatic calcification in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is the current state-of-the art imaging modality in the assessment of patients with prostate cancer although a variety of benign conditions, including inflammation, may mimic prostate cancer and act as confounding factors in the discrimination between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Bacteria can infect prostate gland by: ascending the urethra, reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts, direct inoculation of bacteria through inserted biopsy needles or hematogenous seeding. Enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, but an increasing role of Enterococci has been reported. Many strains of these uropathogens exhibit the ability to form biofilm and multidrug- resistance. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) agents, in particular Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, have been also considered as causative pathogens of chronic bacterial prostatitis. On the contrary the effective role in genital diseases of other "genital mycoplasmas" is still a much debated issue. Sexually Transmitted Infections agents should be investigated by molecular methods in both patient and sexual partner. "Next generation" investigations, such as cytokine analysis, cytological typing of immune cells could help stratifying the immune response. Epigenetic dysregulation of inflammatory factors should be investigated according to systemic and compartment-specific signals. The search for biomarkers should also include evaluation of hormonal pathways, as measurement of estrogen levels in semen. Antimicrobials are the first line agents for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis. The success of antimicrobial treatment depends on the antibacterial activity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug which must reach high concentrations in prostate secretion and prostate tissue. Acute bacterial prostatitis can be a serious infection with a potential risk for urosepsis For iInitial treatment of severely ill patients, intravenous administration of high doses of bactericidal antimicrobials, such as broad-spectrum penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, is recommended in combination with an aminoglycoside. Use of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem is justified in presence of multiresistant gramnegative pathogens. The antibiotic treatment of chronic prostatitis is currently based on the use of fluoroquinolones that, given for 2 to 4 weeks, cured about 70% of men with chronic bacterial prostatitis. For the treatment of Chlamydial prostatitis macrolides were shown to be more effective than fluoroquinolones, whereas no differences were observed in microbiological and clinical efficacy between macrolides and tetracyclines for the treatment of infections caused by intracellular pathogens. Aminoglycosides and fosfomycin could be considered as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of quinolone resistant prostatitis. Use of alpha-blockers in CP/CPPS patients with urinary symptoms and analgesics +/- non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), in presence of pain demonstrated a reduction of symptoms reduction and an improvement of quality of life, although long term use of NSAID is limited by side effect profile. However, the multimodal therapeutic regimen by contemporary use of alphablockers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory showed a better control of prostatitis symptoms than single drug treatment. Novel therapeutic substances for the treatment of pain, such as the cannabinoid anandamide would be highly interesting to test. An alternative for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is phytotherapy, as primary therapy or in association with other drugs. Quercetin, pollen extract, extract of Serenoa repens and other mixtures of herbal extracts showed a positive effect on symptoms and quality of life without side effects. The association of CP/CPPS with alterations of intestinal function has been described. Diet has its effects on inflammation by regulation of the composition of intestinal flora and direct action on the intestinal cells (sterile inflammation). Intestinal bacteria (microbiota) interacts with food influencing the metabolic, immune and inflammatory response of the organism. The intestinal microbiota has protective function against pathogenic bacteria, metabolic function by synthesis of vitamins, decomposition of bile  and production of trophic factors (butyrate), and modulation of the intestinal immune system. The alteration of the microbiota is called "dysbiosis" causing invasive intestinal diseases pathologies (  syndrome and food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases) and correlating with numerous systemic diseases including acute and chronic prostatitis. Administration of live probiotics bacteria can be used to regulate the balance if intestinal flora. Sessions of hydrocolontherapy can represent an integration to this therapeutic approach. Finally, microbiological examination of sexual partners can offer supplementary information for treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27349436>The Role of the Microbial Metabolites Including Tryptophan Catabolites and Short Chain Fatty  in the Pathophysiology of Immune-Inflammatory and Neuroimmune Disease.</a></h1><p>There is a growing awareness that  commensal metabolites play a major role in host physiology and indeed the pathophysiology of several illnesses. The composition of the microbiota largely determines the levels of tryptophan in the systemic circulation and hence, indirectly, the levels of serotonin in the brain. Some microbiota synthesize neurotransmitters directly, e.g., gamma-amino butyric , while modulating the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). The composition of the microbiota determines the levels and nature of tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) which in turn has profound effects on aryl hydrocarbon receptors, thereby influencing epithelial barrier integrity and the presence of an inflammatory or tolerogenic environment in the intestine and beyond. The composition of the microbiota also determines the levels and ratios of short chain fatty  (SCFAs) such as butyrate and propionate. Butyrate is a key energy source for colonocytes. Dysbiosis leading to reduced levels of SCFAs, notably butyrate, therefore may have adverse effects on epithelial barrier integrity, energy homeostasis, and the T helper 17/regulatory/T cell balance. Moreover, dysbiosis leading to reduced butyrate levels may increase bacterial translocation into the systemic circulation. As examples, we describe the role of microbial metabolites in the pathophysiology of diabetes type 2 and autism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30205543>The -Brain Axis in Alzheimer's Disease and Omega-3. A Critical Overview of Clinical Trials.</a></h1><p>Despite intensive study, neurodegenerative diseases remain insufficiently understood, precluding rational design of therapeutic interventions that can reverse or even arrest the progressive loss of neurological function. In the last decade, several theories investigating the causes of neurodegenerative diseases have been formulated and a condition or risk factor that can contribute is described by the -brain axis hypothesis: stress, unbalanced diet, and drugs impact altering microbiota composition which contributes to dysbiosis. An altered  microbiota may lead to a dysbiotic condition and to a subsequent increase in intestinal permeability, causing the so-called - syndrome. Herein, in this review we report recent findings in clinical trials on the risk factor of the -brain axis in Alzheimer's disease and on the effect of omega-3 supplementation, in shifting  microbiota balance towards an eubiosis status. Despite this promising effect, evidences reported in selected randomized clinical trials on the effect of omega-3 fatty  on cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease are few. Only Mild Cognitive Impairment, a prodromal state that could precede the progress to Alzheimer's disease could be affected by omega-3 FA supplementation. We report some of the critical issues which emerged from these studies. Randomized controlled trials in well-selected AD patients considering the critical points underlined in this review are warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25838982>Claudin-2 as a mediator of   barrier during intestinal inflammation.</a></h1><p>The epithelial tight junction determines the paracellular water and ion movement in the intestine and also prevents uptake of larger molecules, including antigens, in an uncontrolled manner. Claudin-2, one of the 27 mammalian claudins regulating that barrier function, forms a paracellular channel for small cations and water. It is typically expressed in  epithelia like proximal nephron and small intestine and provides a major pathway for the paracellular transport of sodium, potassium, and fluid. In intestinal inflammation (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), immune-mediated diseases (celiac disease), and infections (HIV enteropathy), claudin-2 is upregulated in small and large intestine and contributes to diarrhea via a leak flux mechanism. In parallel to that upregulation, other epithelial and tight junctional features are altered and the luminal uptake of antigenic macromolecules is enhanced, for which claudin-2 may be partially responsible through induction of tight junction strand discontinuities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29708627>Effect of humic  on intestinal viscosity,   and ammonia excretion in a 24 hr feed restriction model to induce intestinal permeability in broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of humic  (HA) on intestinal viscosity,   and ammonia excretion in a 24 hr feed restriction (FR) model to induce intestinal permeability in chickens. One-day-old male Cobb-Vantress broilers were randomly allocated to one of two groups (n = 25 chickens), with or without 0.2% of isolated HA from worm-compost, and placed in brooder batteries. Chicks had ad libitum access to water and feed for 14 days. Intestinal permeability was induced by 24 hr FR starting at 14 days. At 15 days of age, chickens in both groups were given an appropriate dose of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) by oral gavage. Intestine and liver samples were also collected to evaluate viscosity and bacterial translocation (BT), respectively. An increase (p < .05) in intestinal viscosity was observed in the experimental group consuming 0.2% of HA and was confirmed in a published in vitro digestion model that simulates the chemical and physical conditions of the crop, proventriculus and intestine of chickens. Furthermore, the treated group also showed a significant reduction in FITC-d, liver BT and ammonia in the manure.

Experiments were conducted in broiler chickens to evaluate supplementation of L-glutamine, glycine, and L-arginine in a reduced protein (RP) diet. Experiment 1 examined the growth performance of broilers fed 5 dietary treatments: 1) a standard diet; 2) an RP diet (193.9 g/kg CP in grower and 176.9 g/kg CP in finisher); 3) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg L-Gln; 4) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg Gly; 5) RP diet supplemented with 5 g/kg L-Arg. Each experimental diet was replicated 6 times with 10 birds per replicate. In a subset of 96 birds, experiment 2 tested the 4 RP diets with and without dexamethasone (DEX) to induce  . Each diet was replicated 24 times. Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) was used to test intestinal permeability (IP). Gene expression of selected tight junction proteins in ileal and jejunal tissues was assayed by quantitative PCR. From day 7 to 35, the RP diet increased feed intake (FI) (P < 0.05) and body weight gain (BWG) compared with the standard diet while Gln reduced FI and BWG (P < 0.05) compared with RP. Gly had no effect on BWG or FCR. Supplementation of Arg improved FCR from day 21 to 35 and day 7 to 35. In experiment 2, Arg tended to lower FITC-d (P = 0.086). DEX increased passage of FITC-d into the serum (P < 0.001). The villi surface area was increased in birds fed higher Arg (P < 0.05). DEX and diet interacted (P < 0.01) for jejunal claudin-3 mRNA level where DEX upregulated claudin-3 for all diets except the Arg diet. In summary, with a moderate reduction of protein, satisfactory performance can be obtained. Although Gln and Gly had no demonstrable positive effect on IP and performance of broilers, increasing the dietary Arg by approximately 140% improved FCR and showed indications of improved intestinal barrier function of birds fed an RP diet under a stress model.© The Author(s) 2019.

Our previous study demonstrated that cerebral ischemic stroke triggers dysfunctional  microbiota and increased intestinal permeability. In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism by which  microbiota and SCFAs can treat cerebral ischemic stroke in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion models and use the information to develop new therapies. Our results show that oral administration of non-absorbable antibiotics reduced neurological impairment and the cerebral infarct volume, relieved cerebral edemas, and decreased blood lipid levels by altering the  microbiota. We also found that ischemic stroke decreased intestinal levels of SCFAs. And that transplanting fecal microbiota rich in these metabolites was an effective means of treating the condition. Compared with other SCFAs, butyric  showed the highest negative correlation with ischemic stroke.

Important precipitating and perpetuating factors for ME/CFS are (amongst others) bacterial and viral infections; bacterial translocation due to an increased  permeability; and psychological stress. Recently, Jason et al (2006) reported that the mean age of patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome dying from heart failure, i.e. 58.7 years, is significantly lower than the age of those dying from heart failure in the general US population, i.e. 83.1 years. These findings implicate that ME/CFS is a risk factor to cardio-vascular disorder. This review demonstrates that disorders in various IO&NS pathways provide explanations for the earlier mortality due to cardiovascular disorders in ME/CFS. These pathways are: a) chronic low grade inflammation with extended production of nuclear factor kappa B and COX-2 and increased levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha; b) increased O&NS with increased peroxide levels, and phospholipid oxidation including oxidative damage to phosphatidylinositol; c) decreased levels of specific antioxidants, i.e. coenzyme Q10, zinc and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate; d) bacterial translocation as a result of  ; e) decreased omega-3 polyunsatutared fatty  (PUFAs), and increased omega-6 PUFA and saturated fatty  levels; and f) the presence of viral and bacterial infections and psychological stressors. The mechanisms whereby each of these factors may contribute towards cardio-vascular disorder in ME/CFS are discussed. ME/CFS is a multisystemic metabolic-inflammatory disorder. The aberrations in IO&NS pathways may increase the risk for cardiovascular disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30308002>Grape polyphenols reduce -localized reactive oxygen species associated with the development of metabolic syndrome in mice.</a></h1><p>High-fat diet (HFD)-induced   syndrome combined with low-grade inflammation increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intestine and may contribute to dysbiosis and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Poorly bioavailable and only partially metabolizable dietary polyphenols, such as proanthocyanidins (PACs), may exert their beneficial effects on metabolic health by scavenging intestinal ROS. To test this hypothesis, we developed and validated a novel, noninvasive, in situ method for visualizing intestinal ROS using orally administered ROS-sensitive indocyanine green (ICG) dye. C57BL/6J mice fed HFD for 10 weeks accumulated high levels of intestinal ROS compared to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD). Oral administration of poorly bioavailable grape polyphenol extract (GPE) and β-carotene decreased HFD-induced ROS in the  to levels comparable to LFD-fed mice, while administration of more bioavailable dietary antioxidants (α-lipoic , vitamin C, vitamin E) did not. Forty percent of administered GPE antioxidant activity was measured in feces collected over 24 h, confirming poor bioavailability and persistence in the . The bloom of beneficial anaerobic  bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, associated with improved metabolic status in rodents and humans may be directly linked to protective antioxidant activity of some dietary components.

Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by an immune-inflammatory response combined with a deficit in natural IgM antibodies to oxidative-specific epitopes (OSEs), which are a first-line defense against bacterial infections. This study measured plasma IgA/IgM responses to 5 Gram-negative bacteria in association with IgM responses to malondialdehyde (MDA) and azelaic  in 80 schizophrenia patients (40 with the deficit syndrome and 40 without) and in 38 healthy controls. Deficit schizophrenia was characterized by significantly increased IgA responses to Hafnei alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae as compared with non-deficit schizophrenia. The presence of deficit schizophrenia was highly predicted by increased IgA responses to Pseudomonas putida and IgM responses to all five Gram-negative bacteria and lowered natural IgM to MDA and azelaic  with a bootstrap area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.960 (2000 random curves). A large proportion of the variance (41.5%) in the negative subscale score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was explained by the regression on IgA responses to K. pneumoniae and IgM responses to the five enterobacteria coupled with lowered IgM antibodies to azelaic . There were significant associations between IgA levels to Gram-negative bacteria and Mini-Mental State Examination, Boston naming test, Verbal Fluency, and Word List Memory test scores. These findings provide further evidence that deficit schizophrenia is a distinct phenotype of schizophrenia, which is characterized by an increased impact of Gram-negative commensal bacteria coupled with a deficit in natural IgM, pointing to aberrations in B1 cells. It is concluded that increased bacterial translocation and deficits in the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS) may drive negative symptoms and neurocognitive impairments, which are hallmarks of deficit schizophrenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28600633>IgM-mediated autoimmune responses to oxidative specific epitopes, but not nitrosylated adducts, are significantly decreased in pregnancy: association with bacterial translocation, perinatal and lifetime major depression and the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway.</a></h1><p>Immunoglubulin (Ig)M responses directed to oxidative specific epitopes (OSEs) and nitric oxide (NO)-adducts are significantly associated with major depression and physio-somatic symptoms. End of term serum IgM responses to OSEs and NO-adducts were assayed in pregnant women with (n = 24) and without prenatal depression (n = 25) as well as in 24 non-pregnant women. Associations of IgM/IgA responses to Gram-negative  commensal bacteria (  index) and IgA/IgM responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) were analyzed. IgM responses to OSEs, but not NO-adducts, were significantly reduced at the end of term. There were no significant associations between IgM responses to OSEs and perinatal depression, whilst IgM responses to NO-adducts, especially NO-cysteinyl, were significantly associated with a lifetime major depression. IgM responses to OSEs and NO-cysteinyl were significantly associated with IgA/IgM responses to Gram-negative bacteria, especially Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter koseri. IgM responses to NO-adducts and OSEs, especially malondialdehyde and myristic , and C-reactive protein (CRP) were inversely associated with TRYCAT pathway activity, whilst a lifetime depression and Pseudomonas putida were positively associated. The attenuation of natural IgM-mediated responses to OSEs at the end of term may indicate lowered activity of this part of the compensatory (anti-)inflammatory reflex system and may be partly explained by lowered bacterial translocation. Increased IgM responses to NO-cysteinyl is a biomarker of lifetime depression and may be induced by bacterial translocation. Natural IgM-mediated autoimmune responses, increased nitrosylation and higher CRP levels may have negative regulatory effects on the TRYCAT pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30256966>Effects of zinc amino  complex on biomarkers of  integrity and metabolism during and following heat stress or feed restriction in pigs.</a></h1><p>Study objectives were to determine the effects of zinc (Zn) amino  complex (Availa Zn, Zinpro Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN) on metabolism, biomarkers of  , and inflammation during and following heat stress (HS) and nutrient restriction. Crossbred gilts (n = 50; 50 ± 2 kg BW) were blocked by initial BW and randomly assigned to one of five treatments: 1) thermoneutral (TN) and ad libitum fed a control diet (TNCtl), 2) TN and pair-fed a control diet (PFCtl), 3) TN and pair-fed a Zn-supplemented diet (PFZn), 4) HS and ad libitum fed a control diet (HSCtl), and 5) HS and ad libitum fed a Zn-supplemented diet (HSZn). The study consisted of 3 experimental periods (P): during P1 (7 d), all pigs were fed their respective diets ad libitum and housed in TN conditions (20.84 ± 0.03 °C, 47.11 ± 0.42% relative humidity). During P2 (7 d), HSCtl and HSZn pigs were exposed to progressive cyclical HS conditions (27 to 30 °C, 41.9 ± 0.5% relative humidity), while TNCtl, PFCtl, and PFZn pigs remained in TN conditions and were fed ad libitum or pair-fed to their respective HSCtl and HSZn counterparts. During P3 (5 d; "recovery phase"), all pigs were housed in TN conditions and fed ad libitum. Pigs exposed to HS had overall increased rectal temperature, skin temperature, and respiration rate (0.33 °C, 3.76 °C, and 27 bpm, respectively; P < 0.01). Relative to TN controls, HS decreased ADFI and ADG (28 and 35%, respectively; P < 0.05), but these variables were unaffected by dietary treatment. Additionally, circulating insulin did not differ between HS and TN pigs (P = 0.41), but was decreased in PF relative to TN pigs (P < 0.01). During recovery, no differences were observed in rectal temperature or respiration rate across treatments, but HSZn pigs had decreased skin temperature relative to TN, PF, and HSCtl pigs (P < 0.01). During P3, no Zn effects were observed in production parameters; however, PF pigs had increased ADFI and ADG relative to TN and HS treatments (P < 0.01). During P3, circulating insulin was increased in pigs that were HS relative to TN and PF pigs (75%, P < 0.05). Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) levels were decreased during P3 (P = 0.04) in Zn relative to Ctl-fed pigs. Circulating lipopolysaccharide-binding protein was not different among periods (P > 0.10). In summary, Zn reduced TNFα (regardless of HS), and the stimulatory effect of HS on insulin secretion is amplified during HS recovery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27924137>Exercise-induced stress behavior, -microbiota-brain axis and diet: a systematic review for athletes.</a></h1><p>Fatigue, mood disturbances, under performance and gastrointestinal distress are common among athletes during training and competition. The psychosocial and physical demands during intense exercise can initiate a stress response activating the sympathetic-adrenomedullary and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axes, resulting in the release of stress and catabolic hormones, inflammatory cytokines and microbial molecules. The  is home to trillions of microorganisms that have fundamental roles in many aspects of human biology, including metabolism, endocrine, neuronal and immune function. The  microbiome and its influence on host behavior, intestinal barrier and immune function are believed to be a critical aspect of the brain- axis. Recent evidence in murine models shows that there is a high correlation between physical and emotional stress during exercise and changes in gastrointestinal microbiota composition. For instance, induced exercise-stress decreased cecal levels of  spp and increased  which have well defined roles in intestinal mucus degradation and immune function. Diet is known to dramatically modulate the composition of the  microbiota. Due to the considerable complexity of stress responses in elite athletes (from   to increased catabolism and depression), defining standard diet regimes is difficult. However, some preliminary experimental data obtained from studies using probiotics and prebiotics studies show some interesting results, indicating that the microbiota acts like an endocrine organ (e.g. secreting serotonin, dopamine or other neurotransmitters) and may control the HPA axis in athletes. What is troubling is that dietary recommendations for elite athletes are primarily based on a low consumption of plant polysaccharides, which is associated with reduced microbiota diversity and functionality (e.g. less synthesis of byproducts such as short chain fatty  and neurotransmitters). As more elite athletes suffer from psychological and gastrointestinal conditions that can be linked to the , targeting the microbiota therapeutically may need to be incorporated in athletes' diets that take into consideration dietary fiber as well as microbial taxa not currently present in athlete's .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403801>IgA/IgM Responses to Gram-Negative Bacteria are not Associated with Perinatal Depression, but with Physio-somatic Symptoms and Activation of the Tryptophan Catabolite Pathway at the End of Term and Postnatal Anxiety.</a></h1><p>Evidence has implicated the translocation of commensal Gram-negative bacteria (Gram-B) due to   in the pathophysiology of depression and physio-somatic symptoms (e.g. fatigue, pain, irritable bowel syndrome, malaise, etc.). In addition, the   may contribute to immune- inflammatory activation and oxidative stress. This study investigated whether bacterial translocation is associated with perinatal depression and anxiety scores and with prenatal physio-somatic symptoms and immune-inflammatory biomarkers, including the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway.Data were collected in pregnant women at the end of term (T1) and 4-6 weeks after delivery (T2) as well as in non-pregnant controls. We examined the associations between serum IgM/IgA responses to Gram-B at the end of term and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale -EPDS) and anxiety (Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory -STAI) symptoms.Levels of C-reactive protein, zinc, haptoglobin, hematocrit and IgA/IgM responses to 9 TRYCATs were also measured. No significant associations of the IgA/IgM responses to Gram-B with prenatal depression and anxiety were observed. Increased IgA/IgM responses to Gram-B predict higher levels of haptoglobin, hematocrit and TRYCATs, in particular quinolinic  and the quinolinic  / kynurenic  ratio. IgA responses to Gram-B were significantly lowered in pregnant women compared to age-matched non-pregnant women, while IgM responses were significantly elevated in participants with alcohol consumption. Physio-somatic symptoms at the end of term were significantly associated with IgM responses to Klebsiella pneumonia. Postnatal anxiety was significantly predicted by IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Our findings suggest that pregnancy may protect against bacterial translocation, while alcohol use may increase bacterial translocation. The results suggest that end of term mucosa-derived immune responses to Gram-B contribute to immune activation, physio-somatic symptoms at the end of term and postnatal anxiety.• Immune responses to Gram - Bacteria associate with physio-somatic symptoms in pregnancy. • IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa predict anxiety symptoms after delivery. • Pregnancy may have a protective effect against bacterial translocation. • Alcohol use increases   and bacterial translocation.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28258445>Physio-somatic symptoms in schizophrenia: association with depression, anxiety, neurocognitive deficits and the tryptophan catabolite pathway.</a></h1><p>To investigate the frequency of physio-somatic symptoms (PS) symptoms in schizophrenia and their relation to positive, negative and affective symptoms; neurocognitive deficits and impairments in the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway. Eighty four patients with schizophrenia and 40 healthy controls were assessed using the 12 item Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating scale (FF) and scales for negative and positive symptoms, depression and anxiety. Cognitive functioning was tested using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Other assessments included: immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgM responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), namely quinolinic (QA), 3-OH-kynurenine (3HK), picolinic (PA), xanthurenic (XA) and kynurenic  (KA) and anthranilic  (AA). More than 50% of the patients studied had elevated levels of physio-somatic (PS) symptoms, significantly co-occurring with depression and anxiety, but not with negative or positive symptoms. PS symptoms were significantly associated with IgA/IgM responses to TRYCATs, including increased IgA responses to 3 HK, PA and XA, and lowered IgA to QA and AA. Fatigue, muscle pain and tension, autonomic and cognitive symptoms and a flu-like malaise were strongly associated with cognitive impairments in spatial planning and working memory, paired associative learning, visual sustained attention and attention set shifting. PS symptoms in schizophrenia aggregate with depression and anxiety symptoms and may be driven by TRYCAT patterning of IgA/IgM-responses, with IgA indicating mucosal-mediated changes and IgM indicating regulatory functions.

Indole 3-propionic  (IPA), in the context of indole, is a ligand for PXR in vivo, and IPA downregulated enterocyte TNF-α while it upregulated junctional protein-coding mRNAs. PXR-deficient (Nr1i2(-/-)) mice showed a distinctly ""  physiology coupled with upregulation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. These defects in the epithelial barrier were corrected in Nr1i2(-/-)Tlr4(-/-) mice. Our results demonstrate that a direct chemical communication between the intestinal symbionts and PXR regulates mucosal integrity through a pathway that involves luminal sensing and signaling by TLR4.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Fecal dysbiosis, characterized by an overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in autochthonous non-pathogenic bacteria, becomes prominent with the progression of liver cirrhosis. In cirrhotic patients, disruption of the intestinal barrier causes intestinal hyperpermeability (i.e.  ), which is closely related to  dysmotility, dysbiosis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and may induce pathological bacterial translocation. Although the involved microbial taxa are somewhat different between the cirrhotic patients from the East and the West, the common manifestation of a shortage of bacteria that contribute to the production of short-chain fatty  and secondary bile  may facilitate intestinal inflammation,   and  dysbiosis. Translocated endotoxin and bacterial DNA are capable of provoking potent inflammation and affecting the metabolic and hemodynamic systems, which may ultimately enhance the progression of liver cirrhosis and its various complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE), variceal bleeding, infection and renal disturbances. Among studies on the microbiome-based therapeutics, findings of probiotic effects on HE have been contradictory in spite of several supportive results. However, the effects of synbiotics and prebiotics are substantially documented. The background of their effectiveness should be evaluated again in relation to the cirrhosis-related changes in  microbiome and their metabolic effects. Strict indications for the antibiotic rifaximin remain unestablished, although its effect is promising, improving HE and other complications with little influence on microbial populations. The final goal of microbiome-based therapeutics is to adjust the -liver axis to the maximal benefit of cirrhotic patients, with the aid of evolving metagenomic and metabolomic analyses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17476358>A hypomorphic R229Q Rag2 mouse mutant recapitulates human Omenn syndrome.</a></h1><p>Rag enzymes are the main players in V(D)J recombination, the process responsible for rearrangement of TCR and Ig genes. Hypomorphic Rag mutations in humans, which maintain partial V(D)J activity, cause a peculiar SCID associated with autoimmune-like manifestations, Omenn syndrome (OS). Although a deficient ability to sustain thymopoiesis and to produce a diverse T and B cell repertoire explains the increased susceptibility to severe infections, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the spectrum of clinical and immunological features of OS remain poorly defined. In order to better define the molecular and cellular pathophysiology of OS, we generated a knockin murine model carrying the Rag2 R229Q mutation previously described in several patients with OS and  forms of SCID. These Rag2(R229Q/R229Q) mice showed oligoclonal T cells, absence of circulating B cells, and peripheral eosinophilia. In addition, activated T cells infiltrated  and skin, causing diarrhea, alopecia, and, in some cases, severe erythrodermia. These findings were associated with reduced thymic expression of Aire and markedly reduced numbers of naturally occurring Tregs and NKT lymphocytes. In conclusion, Rag2(R229Q/R229Q) mice mimicked most symptoms of human OS; our findings support the notion that impaired immune tolerance and defective immune regulation are involved in the pathophysiology of OS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30400586>The Role of Diet, Micronutrients and the  Microbiota in Age-Related Macular Degeneration: New Perspectives from the ⁻Retina Axis.</a></h1><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex multifactorial disease and the primary cause of legal and irreversible blindness among individuals aged ≥65 years in developed countries. Globally, it affects 30⁻50 million individuals, with an estimated increase of approximately 200 million by 2020 and approximately 300 million by 2040. Currently, the neovascular form may be able to be treated with the use of anti-VEGF drugs, while no effective treatments are available for the dry form. Many studies, such as the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS 2, have shown a potential role of micronutrient supplementation in lowering the risk of progression of the early stages of AMD. Recently, low-grade inflammation, sustained by dysbiosis and a  , has been shown to contribute to the development of AMD. Given the ascertained influence of the  microbiota in systemic low-grade inflammation and its potential modulation by macro- and micro-nutrients, a potential role of diet in AMD has been proposed. This review discusses the role of the  microbiota in the development of AMD. Using PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, we searched for recent scientific evidence discussing the impact of dietary habits (high-fat and high-glucose or -fructose diets), micronutrients (vitamins C, E, and D, zinc, beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin) and omega-3 fatty  on the modulation of the  microbiota and their relationship with AMD risk and progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28915953>Syntrophic imbalance and the etiology of bacterial endoparasitism diseases.</a></h1><p>This article outlines the proposed 'syntrophic imbalance hypothesis' for etiology of bacterial endoparasitism diseases. This hypothesis involves microbes (archaea and bacteria) that exist in human body biofilms in syntrophic associations, where bacteria ferment nutrients to produce short chain fatty  (SCFAs) that are used by methanogenic archaeons to produce methane. Overgrowth of archaea on human tissues (e.g., in association with intestines, teeth or lungs) results in excessive removal of SCFAs from the biofilms and this triggers bacteria in the free-living biofilm state to convert to the endoparasitic state and become intracellular in host cells where they incite inflammation and disease. The proposed model provides the mechanism to explain dysbiosis etiology of several human diseases, including gingivitis,   syndrome, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, among others.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We review that depression is accompanied by an inflammatory reaction as indicated by an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN)-gamma. These cytokines are stress-sensitive and may cause depressive behaviors. The latter may be induced by an increased catabolism of tryptophan, the precursor of serotonin, to neurotoxic TRYCATs (tryptophan catabolites along the indoleamine oxidase pathway). Inflammatory biomarkers are detected in animal models of depression. Newly developed animal models of depression are based on induced inflammation. Most if not all antidepressants have specific anti-inflammatory effects. Anti-inflammatory compounds may augment the clinical efficacy of antidepressants. Depression is also accompanied by an IgM-related (auto)immune response directed against disrupted lipid membrane components, such as phosphatidyl-inositol, by-products of lipid peroxidation, e.g. azelaic  and malondialdehyde, and NO-modified amino-, which are normally not detected by the immune system but due to damage caused by O&NS have become immunogenic. Increased translocation of lipopolysaccharide from gram-negative bacteria, which may be induced by internal and external stressors, may further aggravate the induced IO&NS pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445722>Dissolution of lipids from mucus: a possible mechanism for prompt disruption of  barrier function by alcohol.</a></h1><p>Acute and/or chronic alcohol ingestion has been shown to exacerbate the morbidity and mortality rate associated with acute mechanical and/or thermal trauma. While alcohol ingestion can affect many organs and systems, clinical and preclinical studies indicate that alcohol ingestion can cause a ' ' syndrome which in turn contributes to infection and systemic organ dysfunction. This study investigated the acute effect of alcohol on  barrier function. Using an in vivo isolated  sac model of naïve male rats, each individual  sac was injected with different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40%, v/v) of alcohol. After different times of alcohol exposure, each isolated  segment was harvested and intestinal permeability and mucosal surface hydrophobicity (a physiologic marker of mucus barrier function) were measured as well as luminal DNA, mucus, protein and free fatty . The results showed that alcohol caused dose-dependent and time-dependent increases in  permeability and decreases in mucosal surface hydrophobicity, with significant changes to be observed 5 min after treatment with 10% alcohol. In addition, it is further found that these changes in permeability and hydrophobicity are more closely associated with increased intestinal luminal free fatty  levels but not protein or DNA levels. These results suggest that alcohol may cause loss of  barrier function by extracting and dissolving lipids from the mucus with a resultant decrease in mucosal surface hydrophobicity, which is a critical component of  barrier function.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

These IO&NS pathways are induced by a number of trigger factors, for example psychological stress, strenuous exercise, viral infections and an increased translocation of LPS from gram-bacteria ( ). The 'psychosomatic' symptoms experienced by CFS patients are caused by intracellular inflammation (aches and pain, muscular tension, fatigue, irritability, sadness, and the subjective feeling of infection); damage caused by O&NS (aches and pain, muscular tension and fatigue); and -derived inflammation (complaints of irritable bowel). Inflammatory pathways (monocytic activation) are also detected in somatizing disorder.'Functional' symptoms, as occurring in CFS and somatization, have a genuine organic cause, that is activation of peripheral and central IO&NS pathways and -derived inflammation.

The presence of gastritis did not correlate with the presence of increased permeability. The site of altered intestinal permeability was shown by an in-vitro permeability test to be the small bowel.

Two experiments were conducted in broilers to evaluate the effect of three concentrations of Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1; 2, 1.5, or 1 ppm) on gastrointestinal leakage and liver bacterial translocation (BT). In experiment 1, 240 day-of-hatch male broilers were allocated in two groups, each group had six replicates of 20 chickens (n = 120/group): Control feed or feed + 2 ppm AFB1. In experiment 2, 240 day-of-hatch male broilers were allocated in three groups, each group had five replicates of 16 chickens (n = 80/group): Control feed; feed + 1 ppm AFB1; or feed + 1.5 ppm AFB1. In both experiments, chickens were fed starter (days 1-7) and grower diets (days 8-21) ad libitum and performance parameters were evaluated every week. At day 21, all chicks received an oral gavage dose of FITC-d (4.16 mg/kg) 2.5 h before collecting blood samples to evaluate gastrointestinal leakage of FITC-d. In experiment 2, a hematologic analysis was also performed. Liver sections were aseptically collected and cultured using TSA plates to determine BT. Cecal contents were collected to determine total colony-forming units per gram of Gram-negative bacteria, lactic  bacteria (LAB), or anaerobes by plating on selective media. In experiment 2, liver, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius were removed to determine organ weight ratio, and also intestinal samples were obtained for morphometric analysis. Performance parameters, organ weight ratio, and morphometric measurements were significantly different between Control and AFB1 groups in both experiments.  leakage of FITC-d was not affected by the three concentrations of AFB1 evaluated (P > 0.05). Interestingly, a significant reduction in BT was observed in chickens that received 2 and 1 ppm AFB1. An increase (P < 0.05) in total aerobic bacteria, total Gram negatives, and total LAB were observed in chickens fed with 2 and 1.5 ppm of AFB1 when compared with Control and 1 ppm chickens.

Fourteen lactating Holstein cows (parity 2.6 ± 0.3; 117 ± 18 d in milk) were enrolled in 2 experimental periods. Period 1 (5 d) served as the baseline for period 2 (7 d), during which cows received 1 of 2 i.v. treatments twice per day: sterile saline or a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI; 1.5 mg/kg of body weight). Gamma-secretase inhibitors reduce intestinal barrier function by inhibiting crypt cell differentiation into absorptive enterocytes. During period 2, control cows receiving sterile saline were pair-fed (PF) to the GSI-treated cows, and all cows were killed at the end of period 2. Administering GSI increased goblet cell area 218, 70, and 28% in jejunum, ileum, and colon, respectively. In the jejunum, GSI-treated cows had increased crypt depth and reduced villus height, villus height-to-crypt depth ratio, cell proliferation, and mucosal surface area. Plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein increased with time, and tended to be increased 42% in GSI-treated cows relative to PF controls on d 5 to 7. Circulating haptoglobin and serum amyloid A concentrations increased (585- and 4.4-fold, respectively) similarly in both treatments. Administering GSI progressively reduced dry matter intake (66%) and, by design, the pattern and magnitude of decreased nutrient intake was similar in PF controls. A similar progressive decrease (42%) in milk yield occurred in both treatments, but we observed no treatment effects on milk components. Cows treated with GSI tended to have increased plasma insulin (68%) and decreased circulating nonesterified fatty  (29%) compared with PF cows. For both treatments, plasma glucose decreased with time while β-hydroxybutyrate progressively increased. Liver triglycerides increased 221% from period 1 to sacrifice in both treatments. No differences were detected in liver weight, liver moisture, or body weight change. Intentionally compromising intestinal barrier function caused inflammation, altered metabolism, and markedly reduced feed intake and milk yield. Further, we demonstrated that progressive feed reduction appeared to cause   and inflammation.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Interestingly, functional and inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases are often reported as a comorbidity in ASDs, indicating -brain axis as a novel emerging approach. Recently, a central role for peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α has been addressed in neurological functions, associated with the behaviour. Among endogenous lipids, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a PPAR-α agonist, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory effects both at central and peripheral level. Based on this background, the aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacological effects of PEA on autistic-like behaviour of BTBR T+tf/J mice and to shed light on the contributing mechanisms. Our results showed that PEA reverted the altered behavioural phenotype of BTBR mice, and this effect was contingent to PPAR-α activation. Moreover, PEA was able to restore hippocampal BDNF signalling pathway, and improve mitochondrial dysfunction, both pathological aspects, known to be consistently associated with ASDs. Furthermore, PEA reduced the overall inflammatory state of BTBR mice, reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines at hippocampal, serum, and colonic level. The analysis of  permeability and the expression of colonic tight junctions showed a reduction of   in PEA-treated BTBR mice. This finding together with PEA effect on  microbiota composition suggests an involvement of microbiota--brain axis. In conclusion, our results demonstrated a therapeutic potential of PEA in limiting ASD symptoms, through its pleiotropic mechanism of action, supporting neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory effects, and the modulation of -brain axis.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Alcohol-induced dysregulation of intestinal tight junction proteins, such as Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1), plays an important role in alcohol-induced  leakiness. However, the mechanism of alcohol-induced disruption of tight junction proteins is not well established. The goal of this study was to elucidate this mechanism by studying the role of microRNA 212 (miR-212) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in alcohol-induced  leakiness.The permeability of the Caco-2 monolayer was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance and flux of fluorescein sulfonic . miR-212 was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The wild-type, iNOS knockout, and miR-212 knockdown mice were fed with alcohol diet (29% of total calories, 4.5% v/v) for 8 weeks. The LNA-anti-miR-212 was used to inhibit miR-212 expression in mice. The alcohol-induced intestinal permeability, miR-212 expression, and liver injuries in mice were measured.Our in vitro monolayer and in vivo mice studies showed that: (i) alcohol-induced overexpression of the intestinal miR-212 and intestinal hyperpermeability is prevented using miR-212 knockdown techniques; and (ii) iNOS is up-regulated in the intestine by alcohol and that iNOS signaling is required for alcohol-induced miR-212 overexpression, ZO-1 disruption,  leakiness, and steatohepatitis.These studies thus support a novel miR-212 mechanism for alcohol-induced  leakiness and a potential target that could be exploited for therapeutic intervention to prevent   and liver injury in alcoholics.Copyright © 2015 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596218>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension:  Dysbiosis as the Mediator?</a></h1><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases.

Mechanistic studies in animal models of AID and observational studies in patients have found alterations in  microbiota communities and their metabolites, suggesting a microbial contribution to the onset or progression of AID. The  microbiota and its metabolites have been shown to influence immune functions and immune homeostasis both within the  and systematically. Microbial derived-short chain fatty  (SCFA) and bio-transformed bile  (BA) have been shown to influence the immune system acting as ligands specific cell signaling receptors like GPRCs, TGR5 and FXR, or via epigenetic processes. Similarly, intestinal permeability ( ) and bacterial translocation are important contributors to chronic systemic inflammation and, without repair of the intestinal barrier, might represent a continuous inflammatory stimulus capable of triggering autoimmune processes. Recent studies indicate gender-specific differences in immunity, with the  microbiota shaping and being concomitantly shaped by the hormonal milieu governing differences between the sexes. A bi-directional cross-talk between microbiota and the endocrine system is emerging with bacteria being able to produce hormones (e.g. serotonin, dopamine and somatostatine), respond to host hormones (e.g. estrogens) and regulate host hormones' homeostasis (e.g by inhibiting gene prolactin transcription or converting glucocorticoids to androgens). We review herein how  microbiota and its metabolites regulate immune function, intestinal permeability and possibly AID pathological processes. Further, we describe the dysbiosis within the  microbiota observed in different AID and speculate how restoring  microbiota composition and its regulatory metabolites by dietary intervention including prebiotics and probiotics could help in preventing or ameliorating AID. Finally, we suggest that, given consistent observations of microbiota dysbiosis associated with AID and the ability of SCFA and BA to regulate intestinal permeability and inflammation, further mechanistic studies, examining how dietary microbiota modulation can protect against AID, hold considerable potential to tackle increased incidence of AID at the population level.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This is sometimes underestimated because, in contrast with muscle, investigations of liver function are technically very difficult. Nevertheless, recent experimental and clinical research has demonstrated clearly that, due in part to its anatomic position, the liver is exquisitely sensitive to insulin and other hormonal and neural factors, either by direct intrahepatic mechanisms or indirectly by organ cross-talk with muscle or adipose tissue. Because the liver receives absorbed nutrients, these have a direct impact on liver function, whether via a caloric excess or via the nature of food components (eg, fructose, many lipids, and trans fatty ). An emerging observation with a possibly great future is the increase in intestinal permeability observed as a consequence of high fat intake or bacterial modifications in microbiota, whereby substances normally not crossing the  gain access to the liver, where inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipid accumulation leads to fatty liver, a situation observed very early in the development of diabetes. The visceral adipose tissue located nearby is another main source of inflammatory substances and oxidative stress, and also acts on hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, resulting in stimulation of macrophages. Liberation of these substances, in particular triglycerides and inflammation factors, into the circulation leads to ectopic fat deposition and vascular damage. Therefore, the liver is directly involved in the development of the prediabetic cardiometabolic syndrome. Treatments are mainly metformin, and possibly statins and vitamin D. A very promising avenue is treatment of the  , which appears increasingly to be an important causal factor in hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22521198>Role of intestinal permeability and inflammation in the biological and behavioral control of alcohol-dependent subjects.</a></h1><p>Mood and cognition alterations play a role in the motivation for alcohol-drinking.

Enhanced intestinal permeability and elevated blood LPS characterize alcohol-dependent mice. However, no data have been published in non-cirrhotic humans. Our first goal was to test whether intestinal permeability, blood LPS and cytokines are increased in non-cirrhotic alcohol-dependent subjects before withdrawal and if they recover after withdrawal. Our second goal was to test correlations between these biochemical and the behavioral variables to explore the possibility of a role for a -brain interaction in the development of alcohol-dependence.Forty alcohol-dependent-subjects hospitalized for a 3-week detoxification program were tested at onset (T1) and end (T2) of withdrawal and compared for biological and behavioral markers with 16 healthy subjects.

At T2 however, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was negatively correlated with depression, anxiety and craving.  and inflammation were observed in non-cirrhotic alcohol-dependent subjects and inflammation was correlated to depression and alcohol-craving.

Numerous nutraceuticals have a beneficial role in treatment-resistant depression and include, herbal medicines of which Hypericum perforatum is the best studied, omega-3 fatty  preparations, S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAMe), various mineral formulations (e.g., magnesium) and folate (singly or in combination with B group vitamins) are prescribed to a lesser extent. Furthermore, a largely neglected area of research activity has been the role of live probiotic cultures that contribute to repairing dysbiosis (a   barrier abnormality) in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). In this commentary, we build a hypothesis that in addition suggests that GIT metabolites that are elaborated by the microbiome cohort may provide novel and significant avenues for efficacious therapeutic interventions for mood disorders. We posit that the microbiome in the gastrointestinal tract is implicit as an important participant for the amelioration of adverse mood conditions via the diverse metabolic activities provided by live beneficial bacteria (probiotics) as an active adjuvant treatment. This activity is in part triggered by a controlled release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hence further questions the antioxidant/oxidative stress postulate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290146>Multifunctional Role of 35 Kilodalton Hyaluronan in Promoting Defense of the Intestinal Epithelium.</a></h1><p>Intestinal epithelium plays a critical role in host defense against orally acquired pathogens. Dysregulation of this protective barrier is a primary driver of inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's and ulcerative colitis) and also infant gastrointestinal infections. Previously, our lab reported that hyaluronan (HA) isolated from human milk induces the expression of the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin in vivo and protects against Salmonella Typhimurium infection of epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, we demonstrated that commercially available 35 kDa size HA induces the expression of β-defensin, upregulates the expression of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and attenuates murine Citrobacter rodentium infection in vivo. In this current study, we report that HA35 remains largely intact and biologically active during transit through the digestive tract where it directly induces β-defensin expression upon epithelial cell contact. We also demonstrate HA35 abrogation of murine Salmonella Typhimurium infection as well as downregulation of  tight junction protein claudin-2 expression. Taken together, we propose a dual role for HA in host innate immune defense at the epithelial cell surface, acting to induce antimicrobial peptide production and also block pathogen-induced  . HA35 is therefore a promising therapeutic in the defense against bacterially induced colitis in compromised adults and vulnerable newborns.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30231628> brain in neurological and psychiatric disorders: Drivers and consequences.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain barrier acts as a highly regulated interface; its dysfunction may exacerbate, and perhaps initiate, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.In this narrative review, focussing on redox, inflammatory and mitochondrial pathways and their effects on the blood-brain barrier, a model is proposed detailing mechanisms which might explain how increases in blood-brain barrier permeability occur and can be maintained with increasing inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress being the initial drivers.Peripheral inflammation, which is causatively implicated in the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders, is associated with elevated peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn cause increased blood-brain barrier permeability. Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, and reactive nitrogen species, such as nitric oxide and peroxynitrite, play essential roles in normal brain capillary endothelial cell functioning; however, chronically elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and damage to the blood-brain barrier. Activated microglia, redox control of which is mediated by nitric oxide synthases and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases, secrete neurotoxic molecules such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, prostaglandin, cyclooxygenase-2, quinolinic , several chemokines (including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 [CXCL-1] and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α [MIP-1α]) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, which can exert a detrimental effect on blood-brain barrier integrity and function. Similarly, reactive astrocytes produce neurotoxic molecules such as prostaglandin E2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can cause a ' brain'.Chronic inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress is associated with the development of a ' '. The following evidence-based approaches, which address the   and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, are suggested as potential therapeutic interventions for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders: melatonin, statins, probiotics containing Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, N-acetylcysteine, and prebiotics containing fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085297>Sodium butyrate ameliorates insulin resistance and renal failure in CKD rats by modulating intestinal permeability and mucin expression.</a></h1><p>The associated increase in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and uremic toxins in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has shifted the way we focus on intestinal microbiota. This study shows that a disruption of the intestinal barrier in CKD promotes leakage of LPS from the , subsequently decreasing insulin sensitivity. Butyrate treatment improved the intestinal barrier function by increasing colonic mucin and tight junction (TJ) proteins. This modulation further ameliorated metabolic functions such as insulin intolerance and improved renal function.Renal failure was induced by 5/6th nephrectomy (Nx) in rats. A group of Nx and control rats received sodium butyrate in drinking water. The Nx groups were compared with sham-operated controls.The Nx rats had significant increases in serum creatinine, urea and proteinuria. These animals had impaired glucose and insulin tolerance and increased gluconeogenesis, which corresponded with decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. The Nx animals suffered significant loss of intestinal TJ proteins, colonic mucin and mucin 2 protein. This was associated with a significant increase in circulating LPS, suggesting a   phenomenon. 5'adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, known to modulate epithelial TJs and glucose metabolism, was significantly reduced in the intestine of the Nx group. Anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10, anti-bacterial peptide and cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide were also lowered in the Nx cohort. Butyrate treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation, improved renal function and controlled hyperglycemia.Butyrate improves AMPK phosphorylation, increases GLP-1 secretion and promotes colonic mucin and TJ proteins, which strengthen the  wall. This decreases LPS leakage and inflammation. Taken together, butyrate improves metabolic parameters such as insulin resistance and markers of renal failure in CKD animals.© The Author(s) 2018.

Since an increased number of veterans complain of gastrointestinal (GI), neuroinflammatory and metabolic complications as they age and there are limited options for a cure, the present study was focused to assess the role of butyrate, a short chain fatty  for attenuating GWI-associated GI and metabolic complications. Results in a GWI-mouse model of permethrin and pyridostigmine bromide (PB) exposure showed that oral butyrate restored  homeostasis and increased GPR109A receptor copies in the small intestine (SI). Claudin-2, a protein shown to be upregulated in conditions of   was significantly decreased following butyrate administration. Butyrate decreased TLR4 and TLR5 expressions in the liver concomitant to a decrease in TLR4 activation. GW-chemical exposure showed no clinical signs of liver disease but a significant alteration of metabolic markers such as SREBP1c, PPAR-α, and PFK was evident. Liver markers for lipogenesis and carbohydrate metabolism that were significantly upregulated following GW chemical exposure were attenuated by butyrate priming in vivo and in human primary hepatocytes. Further, Glucose transporter Glut-4 that was shown to be elevated following liver complications were significantly decreased in these mice after butyrate administration. Finally, use of TLR4 KO mice completely attenuated the liver metabolic changes suggesting the central role of these receptors in the GWI pathology. In conclusion, we report a butyrate specific mechanistic approach to identify and treat increased metabolic abnormalities in GWI veterans with systemic inflammation, chronic fatigue, GI disturbances, metabolic complications and weight gain.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to investigate whether circulating markers of bacterial translocation were associated with survival in a Norwegian primary sclerosing cholangitis cohort.Serum levels of zonulin, intestinal fatty  binding protein, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were measured in 166 primary sclerosing cholangitis patients and 100 healthy controls.Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and soluble CD14 were elevated in primary sclerosing cholangitis compared with healthy controls (median 13 662 vs 12 339 ng/mL, P = 0.010 and 1657 vs 1196 ng/mL, P < 0.001, respectively). High soluble CD14 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (values >optimal cut-off using receiver operating characteristics) were associated with reduced liver transplantation-free survival (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). The concentration of soluble CD14 was higher in patients with hepatobiliary cancer compared to other primary sclerosing cholangitis patients and healthy controls. Zonulin was lower in primary sclerosing cholangitis than controls, but when excluding primary sclerosing cholangitis patients with increased prothrombin time zonulin concentrations were similar in primary sclerosing cholangitis and healthy controls. Concomitant inflammatory bowel disease did not influence the results, while inflammatory bowel disease patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 40) had lower concentration of soluble CD14. In multivariable Cox regression, high soluble CD14 and high lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were associated with transplantation-free survival, independent from Mayo risk score (HR: 2.26 [95% CI: 1.15-4.43], P = 0.018 and HR: 2.00 [95% CI: 1.17-3.43], P = 0.011, respectively).Primary sclerosing cholangitis patients show increased levels of circulating markers of bacterial translocation. High levels are associated with poor prognosis measured by transplantation-free survival, indicating that ongoing  leakage could have clinical impact in primary sclerosing cholangitis.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Postpartum depression is predicted by end of term prenatal depressive symptoms whilst a lifetime history of mood disorders appears to increase the risk for both prenatal and postpartum depression. This review provides a critical appraisal of available evidence linking IO&NS pathways to prenatal and postpartum depression. The electronic databases Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus were sources for this narrative review focusing on keywords, including perinatal depression, (auto)immune, inflammation, oxidative, nitric oxide, nitrosative, tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), kynurenine,   and microbiome. Prenatal depressive symptoms are associated with exaggerated pregnancy-specific changes in IO&NS pathways, including increased C-reactive protein, advanced oxidation protein products and nitric oxide metabolites, lowered antioxidant levels, such as zinc, as well as lowered regulatory IgM-mediated autoimmune responses. The latter pathways coupled with lowered levels of endogenous anti-inflammatory compounds, including ω3 polyunsaturated fatty , may also underpin the pathophysiology of postpartum depression. Although increased bacterial translocation, lipid peroxidation and TRYCAT pathway activation play a role in mood disorders, similar changes do not appear to be relevant in perinatal depression. Some IO&NS biomarker characteristics of mood disorders are found in prenatal depression indicating that these pathways partly contribute to the association of a lifetime history of mood disorders and perinatal depression. However, available evidence suggests that some IO&NS pathways differ significantly between perinatal depression and mood disorders in general.

Zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) protein is a major component of tight junctions that regulates intestinal permeability. microRNAs (miRNAs) are recently discovered regulatory molecules that inhibit expression of their target genes.(i) to investigate the effect of alcohol on miRNA-212 (miR-212) and on expression of its predicted target gene, ZO-1, (ii) to study the potential role of miR-212 in the pathophysiology of ALD in man.Using a TaqMan miRNA assay system, we measured miR-212 expression levels in colon biopsy samples from patients with ALD and in Caco-2 cells (a human intestinal epithelial cell line) treated with or without EtOH. We measured ZO-1 protein levels using western blots. ZO-1 mRNA was assayed using real-time PCR. Intestinal barrier integrity was measured using fluorescein sulfonic  clearance and immunofluorescent staining for ZO-1.Ethanol increased miR-212 expression, decreased ZO-1 protein levels, disrupted tight junctions, and increased the permeability of monolayers of Caco-2 cells. An miR-212 over-expression is correlated with hyperpermeability of the monolayer barrier. miR-212 levels were higher in colon biopsy samples in patients with ALD than in healthy controls; ZO-1 protein levels were lower.These data suggest a novel mechanism for alcohol-induced  leakiness, one in which EtOH induces miR-212 over-expression which causes  leakiness by down-regulating ZO-1 translation. This mechanism is a potential therapeutic target for   in patients with or at risk for ALD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29033938>Early-Life Nutritional Factors and Mucosal Immunity in the Development of Autoimmune Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an immune-mediated disease with a strong genetic basis but might be influenced by non-genetic factors such as microbiome development that "programs" the immune system during early life as well. Factors influencing pathogenesis, including a  intestinal mucosal barrier, an aberrant  microbiota composition, and altered immune responsiveness, offer potential targets for prevention and/or treatment of T1D through nutritional or pharmacologic means. In this review, nutritional approaches during early life in order to protect against T1D development have been discussed. The critical role of tolerogenic dendritic cells in central and peripheral tolerance has been emphasized. In addition, since the  microbiota affects the development of T1D through short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-dependent mechanisms, we hypothesize that nutritional intervention boosting SCFA production may be used as a novel prevention strategy. Current retrospective evidence has suggested that exclusive and prolonged breastfeeding might play a protective role against the development of T1D. The beneficial properties of human milk are possibly attributed to its bioactive components such as unique immune-modulatory components human milk oligosaccharides and metabolites derived thereof, including SCFAs. These components might play a key role in healthy immune development and creating a fit and resilient immune system in early and later life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30597073>Reduced protein diet and amino  concentration alter intestinal barrier function and performance of broiler chickens with or without synthetic glucocorticoid.</a></h1><p>Little is known about the effect of low-protein (LP) diets on intestinal barrier function and permeability. In the first part of this study, starting on day 9 of age, the growth performance of the birds fed 3 experimental diets in each phase of feeding (G/F: grower/finisher) was investigated. Three experimental diets were as follows: LP (170/150 g/kg CP) fortified with essential amino  (EAA), standard protein (SP), (202/190 g/kg), and high protein (HP) (220/210 g/kg). LP and SP diets contained a similar level of EAA concentration, while the HP diet contained 10% above the Ross 308 specifications. Each diet was replicated 6 times (10 male birds per replicate). The second part investigated intestinal permeability (IP) and function on additional 72 birds. On days 14, 16, and 20, a total of 36 birds (12 birds per diet) were injected with dexamethasone (DEX) to induce  . Birds fed LP diets had lower body weight gain (BWG) and higher feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared with SP and HP diets in both grower and finisher phases of feeding. For the challenge part, DEX increased the FCR independent of diets. Diet and DEX interacted for BWG, whereby the effect of diets was only evident in sham-injected birds. Birds fed LP had a higher fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) concentration indicating a more permeable intestine compared to HP, but similar to SP. DEX increased FITC-d concentration in all dietary treatments. Birds fed LP had less ileal zonula occludens-2 (ZO-2) expression in comparison with SP, but not HP. DEX increased the expression of Claudin3 and ZO-2 and reduced Claudin1 (P < 0.05) and junctional adhesion molecule 2 in the ileum. Expression of ileal Na+-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) was upregulated in LP fed group. It is concluded that compared with SP, IP can be maintained in LP by supplementing EAA. However, when compared with HP, feeding birds with LP may lead to a higher IP. DEX had a profound independent effect on intestinal barrier function.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243807>Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with increased -to-blood penetration of short-chain fatty : A new, non-invasive marker of a functional intestinal lesion.</a></h1><p>What is the central question of this study? ' ' has been found in intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. However, functional evaluation of intestinal permeability is not widely used as a diagnostic marker, possibly owing to significant limitations of currently used permeability assays. There is an unmet need for development of a new, non-invasive test to assess intestinal function. What is the main finding and its importance? We show that an increased blood-to-stool ratio of the concentration of  bacteria-produced short-chain fatty  may be used as a marker of  permeability. Our findings lay the groundwork for establishing a new, non-invasive, risk-free diagnostic tool in diseases associated with intestinal barrier malfunction, such as inflammatory bowel disease.Intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are characterized by an impaired -blood barrier commonly referred to as ' '. Therefore, functional evaluation of the -blood barrier is a promising diagnostic marker. We hypothesized that short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) produced by  bacteria might serve as a marker in IBD. Animal experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats with acetic -induced colitis and in sham control animals. The -blood barrier permeability was determined by assessing the ratios of the following: (i) portal blood concentration of SCFAs (C ) to faecal concentration of SCFAs (C ); (ii) systemic blood concentration of SCFAs (C ) to faecal concentration of SCFAs (C ); and (iii) C and C of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran administered into the colon. As a clinical study, we evaluated C , C and the C /C ratio of SCFAs in six paediatric patients with IBD, assessed as mild/moderate/severe by the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) at the time of sample collection, and nine age-matched healthy control subjects. Rats with histologically confirmed IBD had significantly increased ratios of C /C and C /C for SCFAs. This was positively correlated with the plasma FITC-dextran concentration. Likewise, IBD patients showed a significantly higher C /C ratio for SCFAs, including acetic, valeric, isocaproic, caproic and propionic , in comparison to control subjects. In conclusion, in the rats and in paediatric patients with IBD we found an increased blood-to-stool ratio of SCFAs, suggesting an increased -to-blood penetration of SCFAs. These findings pave the way for a new, non-invasive diagnostic tool in IBD and other diseases accompanied by intestinal barrier malfunction.© 2019 The Authors.

This review focuses on specific alterations of  microbiota mostly observed in autistic patients. Particularly, the mechanisms through which such alterations may trigger the production of the bacterial metabolites, or   in autistic people are described. Various altered metabolite levels were observed in the blood and urine of autistic children, many of which were of bacterial origin such as short chain fatty  (SCFAs), indoles and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A less integrative -blood-barrier is abundant in autistic individuals. This explains the leakage of bacterial metabolites into the patients, triggering new body responses or an altered metabolism. Some other co-occurring symptoms such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress in cells, altered tight junctions in the blood-brain barrier and structural changes in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum were also detected. Moreover, this paper suggests that ASD is associated with an unbalanced  microbiota (dysbiosis). Although the cause-effect relationship between ASD and  microbiota is not yet well established, the consumption of specific probiotics may represent a side-effect free tool to re-establish  homeostasis and promote  health. The diagnostic and therapeutic value of bacterial-derived compounds as new possible biomarkers, associated with perturbation in the phenylalanine metabolism, as well as potential therapeutic strategies will be discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24312369>LPS-binding protein and IL-6 mark paradoxical tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in HIV patients.</a></h1><p>Tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) remains a poorly understood complication in HIV-TB co-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). The role of the innate immune system in TB-IRIS is becoming increasingly apparent, however the potential involvement in TB-IRIS of a   and proteins that interfere with TLR stimulation by binding PAMPs has not been investigated before. Here we aimed to investigate the innate nature of the cytokine response in TB-IRIS and to identify novel potential biomarkers.From a large prospective cohort of HIV-TB co-infected patients receiving TB treatment, we compared 40 patients who developed TB-IRIS during the first month of ART with 40 patients matched for age, sex and baseline CD4 count who did not. We analyzed plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP), LPS, sCD14, endotoxin-core antibody, intestinal fatty -binding protein (I-FABP) and 18 pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines before and during ART.We observed lower baseline levels of IL-6 (p = 0.041), GCSF (p = 0.036) and LBP (p = 0.016) in TB-IRIS patients. At IRIS event, we detected higher levels of LBP, IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, G-CSF (p ≤ 0.032) and lower I-FABP levels (p = 0.013) compared to HIV-TB co-infected controls. Only IL-6 showed an independent effect in multivariate models containing significant cytokines from pre-ART (p = 0.039) and during TB-IRIS (p = 0.034).We report pre-ART IL-6 and LBP levels as well as IL-6, LBP and I-FABP levels during IRIS-event as potential biomarkers in TB-IRIS. Our results show no evidence of the possible contribution of a   to TB-IRIS and indicate that IL-6 holds a distinct role in the disturbed innate cytokine profile before and during TB-IRIS.

The transmissibility of ethanol-induced liver disease has been demonstrated using faecal microbiota transfer in preclinical models. This technique has also led to improved survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, suggesting that changes in the composition and function of the  microbiota are causatively linked to alcohol-related liver disease. A major mechanism by which  microbiota influence the development of alcohol-related liver disease is through a  intestinal barrier. This permits translocation of viable bacteria and microbial products to the liver, where they induce and promote inflammation, as well as contribute to hepatocyte death and the fibrotic response. In addition,  dysbiosis is associated with changes in the metabolic function of the intestinal microbiota, bile  composition and circulation, immune dysregulation during onset and progression of alcohol-related liver disease. Findings from preclinical and human studies will be used to demonstrate how alcohol causes intestinal pathology and contributes to alcohol-related liver disease and how the latter is self-perpetuating. Additionally, we summarise the effects of untargeted treatment approaches on the  microbiota, such as diet, probiotics, antibiotics and faecal microbial transplantation in alcohol-related liver disease. We further discuss how targeted approaches can restore intestinal homeostasis and improve alcohol-related liver disease. These approaches are likely to add to the therapeutic options for alcohol-related liver disease independently or in conjunction with steroids.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347427>  biomarkers in depression and suicidal behavior.</a></h1><p>Inflammation is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidal behavior.

We measured plasma levels of  permeability markers, in patients with a recent suicide attempt (rSA), MDD subjects with no history of a suicide attempt (nsMDD), and healthy controls (HC), and related these markers to symptom severity and inflammation.We enrolled rSA (n = 54), nsMDD (n = 13), and HC (n = 17). Zonulin, intestinal fatty  binding protein (I-FABP), soluble CD14, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified in plasma. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Suicide Assessment Scale (SUAS) were used for symptom assessments.The rSA group displayed higher I-FABP and lower zonulin levels compared with both the nsMDD and the HC groups (all P < 0.001). IL-6 correlated positively with I-FABP (r = 0.24, P < 0.05) and negatively with zonulin (r = -0.25, P < 0.05). In all subjects, I-FABP levels correlated positively with MADRS (r = 0.25, P < 0.05) and SUAS scores (r = 0.38, P < 0.001), and the latter correlation was significant also in the nsMDD group (r = 0.60, P < 0.05).The '  hypothesis' may improve our understanding of the link between inflammation and suicidal behavior.
