Validated disease activity measurement instruments were identified. Data regarding app characteristics, including the presence of validated disease activity measurement, were extracted. The Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) was used to review the apps for user experience.A total of 1253 apps were identified in the app stores, and 5 apps met the criteria and were further analyzed. Moreover,  apps (MySpA and Group for Research and Assessment of  and Psoriatic Arthritis App) contained some of the validated disease activity monitoring instruments for specific spondyloarthritis subtypes. These  apps were also rated good on the MARS (with total mean scores ≥4 out of 5), whereas the other apps scored poorly in comparison.There are  high-quality spondyloarthritis disease activity monitoring apps publicly available, but they only target  spondyloarthritis subtypes-ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. There is a lack of high-quality apps that can measure disease activity for other spondyloarthritis subtypes, and no app that consolidates all validated disease activity instruments across subtypes was available.©Yu Heng Kwan, Wei Jie Ong, Mengfei Xiong, Ying Ying Leung, Jie Kie Phang, Charmaine Tze May Wang, Warren Fong.

This risk is not specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of some drugs of this class, such as captopril or enalapril. We aimed to investigate the association between  and ACEI exposure.We analyzed spontaneous reports recorded in the French national Pharmacovigilance Database (FPVD) from 1985 to 31 December 2018. The association between  and ACEI exposure was assessed using the case/non-case method. We also reviewed literature reports.One hundred reports of  after ACEI exposure were registered in the FPVD. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was .40 (95% CI 1.96-.95). Time to onset was < 1 year in 67% of reports. Outcome was favorable in 73% of reports after ACEI discontinuation. Almost all ACEIs were concerned. In the literature, we found 21 published reports of  with ACEIs. Time to onset ranged from 1 week to 4 months. Outcome was also favorable after ACEI discontinuation in over half of the literature reports.We found a statistically significant association between  and ACEI, which constitutes a potential safety signal. The risk of  is a class effect, time to onset is less than 1 year, and outcome is favorable after ACEI discontinuation.  should be mentioned in the SmPCs of all ACEIs, and healthcare professionals should be informed about this risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629629>Multi-omics study in monozygotic twins confirm the contribution of de novo mutation to .</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association studies have identified over 120 risk loci for . However, most of the variations are located in non-coding region with high frequency and small effect size. Pathogenetic variants are rarely reported except HLA-C*0602 with the odds ratio being approximately 4.0 in Chinese population. Although rare variations still account for a small proportion of phenotypic variances in complex diseases, their effect on phenotypes is large. Recently, more and more studies focus on the low-frequency functional variants and have achieved a certain amount of success.Whole genome sequencing and sanger sequencing was performed on 8 MZ twin pairs discordant for  to scan and verified the de novo mutations (DNMs). Additionally, 665 individuals with about 20 years' medical history versus 2054 healthy controls and two published large population studies which had about 8 years' medical history (including 10,727 cases versus 10,582 controls) were applied to validate the enrichment of rare damaging mutations in two DNMs genes. Besides, to verify the pathogenicity of candidate DNM in C3, RNA-sequencing for CD4, CD8 T cells of twins and lesion, non-lesion skin of  patients were carried out. Meanwhile, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to detect the level of C3, C3b in the supernatant of peripheral blood.A total of 27 DNMs between co-twins were identified. We found six of eight twins carry HLA-C∗0602 allele which have large effects on . And it is interesting that a missense mutation in SPRED1 and a splice region mutation in C3 are found in the  individuals in the other two MZ twin pairs without carrying HLA-C*0602 allele. In the replication stage, we found  loss-of-function (LOF) variants of C3 only in 665 cases with about 20 years' medical history and gene-wise analysis in 665 cases and 2054 controls showed that the rare missense mutations in C3 were enriched in cases (OR = 1.91, P = 0.0028). We further scanned the LOF mutations of C3 in two published studies (about 8 years' medical history), and found one LOF mutation in the case without carrying HLA-C*0602. In the individual with DNM in C3, RNA sequencing showed the expression level of C3 in skin was significant higher than healthy samples in public database (TPM fold change = 1.40, P = 0.000181) and ELISA showed protein C3 in peripheral blood was higher (~.-fold difference) than the other samples of twins without DNM in C3.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that DNM in C3 is the likely pathological mutations, and it provided a better understanding of the genetic etiology of  and additional treatments for this disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

While many treatments for  exist, few are convenient and safe long term; even if sufficiently effective, treatments themselves often decrease quality of life and make long-term treatment adherence difficult. Approved in Japan in December 2016, apremilast was expected to function as a simple, long-term, systemic therapeutic agent for . We report on the clinical outcomes of administrating apremilast for  years as observed in 46 psoriatic patients at the Saruwatari Dermatology Clinic between March 2017 and February 2019. We believe the ease of clinic consultation (as compared with large general hospital consultation) draws patients who are busy or have mild symptoms, and consequently poor adherence to regular visits and treatment, reflecting realistic conditions. Major adverse events with apremilast treatment were diarrhea (37.0%) and nausea (15.3%), with most cases of diarrhea being mild. Drug survival analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method revealed a 1-year continuation rate of 46.8% and a -year continuation rate of 37.4%. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores during the observation period declined from 9.3 to .8 (P < 0.0001) on average, with the DLQI-0/1 achievement rate being 28.6%. Based on our findings, we conclude that apremilast is suitable as a long-lasting basic treatment that is easy to prescribe in small clinics and easy to use in everyday life.© 2019 Japanese Dermatological Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678328>Predictors of hospital readmission in US adults with : Readmission in .</a></h2><p>Previous studies showed a large inpatient burden of  in the US.

The safety profile of tildrakizumab was characterized in nonclinical studies using a pharmacologically relevant cynomolgus monkey model. In repeat-dose toxicity studies, cynomolgus monkeys were chronically treated with subcutaneous (SC) injections of 100 mg/kg of tildrakizumab every  weeks up to 9 months. Tildrakizumab was well tolerated, with no toxicological findings (including assessment of reproductive organs; hormonal effects; and cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous system function) at systemic exposures approximately 90 times higher than the recommended human dose of 100 mg. An embryofetal developmental study conducted in pregnant monkeys revealed no treatment-related effects to the developing fetus following SC administration of tildrakizumab 100 mg/kg. In a pre- and postnatal development study,  neonatal deaths due to potential viral infection at 100 mg/kg were considered of uncertain relationship to the treatment based on a lack of historical data on the occurrence of viral infection in neonate cynomolgus monkeys.

University-based researchers, state government leaders, and a local county school system collaborated to use existing health and academic data to (1) evaluate the strength of the relationship between health status and school performance (absenteeism, grades) and () describe the health status of students who are chronically absent. Analyses included descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, negative binomial regression models, and estimated marginal means. The most common health conditions among the 3,663 kindergarten through Grade 12 students were ADD (attention deficit disorder)/ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), asthma, migraine headaches, mental health conditions, and eczema//skin disorders. After controlling for covariates, having asthma or a mental health diagnosis was positively associated with absences; and having an ADD/ADHD or mental health diagnosis was negatively associated with GPA (grade point average). Chronically absent students had significantly lower GPAs, and a higher number of health conditions than other students. The success of this demonstration project encourages strengthening existing collaborations and establishing new multidisciplinary partnerships to analyze existing data sources to learn more about the relationship between student health and academic achievement. Moreover, connecting health status to academic achievement might be a chief tactic for advocating for additional resources to improve the care and management of chronic disease conditions among students.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617856>Decision-Analytic Modeling for Time-Effectiveness of the Sequence of Induction Treatments for Moderate to Severe Plaque .</a></h2><p>Systemic  treatments vary in efficacy and cost but also in time until onset of action. Patients with no response to a first induction treatment are typically switched to another, and some patients require several treatments before they see an improvement.To determine the most cost-effective sequence of induction treatment through a comparative time-effectiveness analysis of different systemic treatment sequences currently licensed in Germany for moderate to severe plaque .This time-effectiveness analysis used a decision-analytic model set in the German health care system. The population simulated to receive the treatment sequences consisted of adult men and women with  vulgaris or plaque type  eligible for systemic treatment. Systematic reviews were performed to generate model input values. Data were collected from November 1 through December 15, 2017, and analyzed from January through August 2018.Five treatment sequences frequently used in Germany, identified through an online expert survey (response rate, 10 of 15 [66.7%]), and 4 theoretical sequences starting with a biological agent. Treatments included methotrexate sodium (MTX), cyclosporine (CSA), fumaric acid esters (FAE), adalimumab (ADA), ixekizumab (IXE), infliximab (INF), and secukinumab (SEC).Two health states were defined: responder (patients achieving a  Area Severity Index [PASI] ≥75) and nonresponder (PASI <75). Probability values were defined as response rates of PASI-75. Treatment effects were determined by the mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score. Time until onset of action was assessed as weeks until 25% of patients reach PASI-75. Individual time-effectiveness ratios were calculated per treatment sequence as time until onset of action (in weeks) per minimally important difference (MID) in DLQI and were subsequently ranked.Treatment sequences starting with a biological agent, including IXE-INF-SEC (1.4 weeks per DLQI-MID), INF-IXE-SEC (.05 weeks per DLQI-MID), SEC-IXE-ADA (.1 weeks per DLQI-MID), and ADA-IXE-SEC (.8 weeks per DLQI-MID) were more time-effective than frequently used treatment sequences, including MTX-SEC-ADA (6.8 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-ADA-IXE (7.0 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-ADA-SEC (7. weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-FAE-ADA (10.05 weeks per DLQI-MID), and FAE-MTX-CSA (11.5 weeks per DLQI-MID). The results were robust to deterministic sensitivity analyses.When allocating monetary resources, policy makers and regulators may want to consider time until patients experience an MID in their quality of life as an additional outcome measure.PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42017074218.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543529>A Cross-Sectional Study on the Dermatoses in Postmenopausal Patients at a Rural-Based Tertiary Health Care Center.</a></h2><p>There is still a dearth of knowledge regarding the types of dermatoses occurring in postmenopausal women.

This study aimed to assess the impact of this disease on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), work productivity, and direct and indirect costs from a societal perspective among Brazilian patients.This is a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter study, enrolling patients with moderate to severe plaque  according to physician evaluation. Data collection was performed from December 2015 to November 2016 through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire and five standardized patient-reported outcomes instruments. Direct costs were estimated by multiplying the amount of resources used (12-month recall period) by the corresponding unit cost. Indirect costs were grouped in two time horizons: annual costs (income reduction and absenteeism) and lifetime costs (demission and early retirement).A total of 188 patients with moderate to severe plaque  were included, with mean age of 48.0 (SD 13.1). "Anxiety and depression" and "pain and discomfort" were the most impaired dimensions, according to the EuroQol Five-Dimension-Three-Level (EQ-5D-3L). The highest effect was found for "symptoms and feelings" [mean (SD) .4 (1.7)] Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) subscale. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) presence and biologic-naïve status were associated with worse HRQoL. Presenteeism was more frequent than absenteeism, according to the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire-General Health (WPAI-GH) [17.4% vs. 6.3%], while physical demands and time management were the most affected Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) subscales [means (SD) 23.5 (28.5) and 17.7 (24.9), respectively]. The estimated annual cost per patient was USD 4034. Direct medical costs accounted for 87.7% of this estimate, direct non-medical costs for .4%, and indirect costs for 9.9%.Results evidenced that moderate to severe plaque  imposes substantial costs to society. Our data showed that this disease negatively affects both work productivity and HRQoL of Brazilian patients. Subgroups with PsA and biologic-naïve patients presented lower HRQoL, showing the impact of this comorbidity and the relevance of biologics in  treatment.Novartis Biociências S.A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419355>Users of biologics in clinical practice: would they be eligible for phase III clinical studies?

However, the data regarding the difference in the periodontal health status of the  patients and the nonpsoriasis controls are limited and inconsistent; hence, a specialized meta-analysis that quantitatively compared the periodontal status between the  and nonpsoriasis subjects by evaluating the related clinical periodontal indexes was needed. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantitatively evaluate whether the periodontal status of  patients is worse than that of nonpsoriasis subjects.  We searched PubMed and EMBASE for all eligible studies that compared the periodontal status between  patients and nonpsoriasis subjects. The studies were screened based on pre-established inclusion criteria. After extracting the available periodontal indexes from the included studies, the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated by pooling the mean and standard deviations (SD) of each index.  In total, 8 studies, including 812  patients and 772 nonpsoriasis subjects, were included in our meta-analysis, and the publication dates ranged from 2013 to 2019; eight periodontal indexes were analyzed. The WMD (95% CIs) for each index were: bleeding on probing (%), 9.188 (4.046-14.330,  < 0.001); probing depth (mm), 0.524 (0.183-0.865,  = 0.003); clinical attachment loss (mm), 0.408 (0.051-0.765,  = 0.025); plaque index, 0.186 (-0.170 to 0.543,  = 0.306); gingival index, 0.458 (-0.413 to 1.328,  = 0.303), remaining teeth, -1.709 (-.106 to -1.312,  < 0.001); missing teeth, 1.130 (0.275-1.985,  = 0.010); the level of alveolar bone loss (mm), 0.400 (0.102-0.698,  = 0.008).  In summary, our meta-analysis revealed that  patients suffer from worse periodontal health than do nonpsoriasis subjects, mainly characterized by worse gingival inflammation, more alveolar bone loss, fewer remaining teeth and more missing teeth. Considering the limitations of this meta-analysis, more high-quality and well-designed studies are needed to validate our conclusions in the future.Copyright © 2019 Qiao, Shi, Zhang, E, Wang, Wang and Liu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421033>Composite Measures of Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis: Comparative Instrument Performance Based on the Efficacy of Guselkumab in an Interventional Phase  Trial.</a></h2><p>Assess performance of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) composite indices and evaluate guselkumab's effect on achieving low disease activity or remission.In this Phase  trial, patients with active PsA (≥3 tender and ≥3 swollen joints, C-reactive protein ≥0.3 mg/dL, ≥3% body-surface-area  involvement) were randomized :1 to subcutaneous guselkumab 100 mg (N=100) or placebo (N=49) at Week 0, Week 4 and q8w through Week44. At Week 16, patients with <5% improvement in swollen and tender joints could early escape (EE) to open-label ustekinumab. Patients continuing placebo crossed-over to receive guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks 24, 28, 36, and 44 (placebo→guselkumab). PsA composite indices (Psoriatic ArthritiS Disease Activity Score [PASDAS], GRAppa Composite scorE [GRACE], modified Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index [mCPDAI], Disease Activity index for PSoriatic Arthritis [DAPSA]) were analyzed as secondary outcomes (last-observation-carried-forward for missing/post-EE data through Week 24; observed data post-Week 24). Instrument performance was assessed.Baseline PASDAS, GRACE, mCPDAI, and DAPSA scores indicated moderate-to-high disease activity. At Week 24, mean changes in each of these composite indices demonstrated significant improvement with guselkumab (-.50, -.73, -3.8, -23.08, respectively) vs. placebo (-0.49, 0.35, -0.8, -4.98; all p<0.001). Significantly more guselkumab-treated patients achieved low (or very-low/remission) disease activity state(s) per PASDAS (very-low+low 35.0% vs. 4.1%; p<0.001), GRACE (29.6% vs. .1%; p<0.001), mCPDAI (45.9% vs. 10.4%, p<0.001), and DAPSA (remission+low 40.0% vs. 12.%; p<0.001); 12% of guselkumab-treated vs. no placebo-treated patients achieved DAPSA remission (p<0.01). The PASDAS and GRACE instruments were more sensitive than the mCPDAI and DAPSA tools in detecting treatment effect. Residual skin disease and enthesitis were marginally more prominent in patients achieving DAPSA low disease activity versus other indices.Guselkumab demonstrated efficacy in achieving low disease activity/remission based on all PsA composite indices assessed.

Thus, it is necessary to visualize chemical specificity of the samples for better medical diagnosis and treatment. Here, we investigate its role in the development of psoriatic lesions, before and after ultraviolet phototherapy, in a case study.  The distribution and morphology of different lipids and fibrous proteins in psoriatic (lesional) tissues were visualized by two complementary label-free imaging techniques: 1) non-linear microscopy (NLM), providing images of lipids/proteins throughout the skin layers at submicrometer resolution; and ) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), offering high chemical specificity and hence the detection of different lipid species in the epidermal and dermal regions. A conventional method of histological evaluation was performed on the tissues, with no direct comparison with NLM and MSI.  Psoriatic tissues had a higher lipid content, mainly in cholesterol, in both the epidermal and dermal regions, compared to healthy tissues. Moreover, the collagen and elastin fibers in the psoriatic tissues had a tendency to assemble as larger bundles, while healthy tissues showed smaller fibers more homogeneously spread. Although phototherapy significantly reduced the cholesterol content, it also increased the amounts of collagen in both lesional and non-lesional tissues.

The current accepted measures and indexes do not exhibit a universal measurement, carry subjective opinions, and vary from one assessor to another. We propose a novel promising technique that provides a universal measure of various skin conditions which accesses the severity of skin disease in a quantitative manner. In this paper, we describe a clinical tool which provides a quantitative analysis of the skin using a mathematical algorithm of calculating Maximum entropy. The current work had been based on assessing skin lesions of  as a prototypic disease and adjacent healthy skin of patients in order to prove the concept of using computing entropy results to assess the skin condition. From the collected data of 11 pairs of the diseased and clinically healthy skin, the healthy skin displayed lower Entropy values with mean μ = .56 ± 0.10 while skin affected by  displayed higher Entropy values with mean μ = 3.30 ± 0.19.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

For  patients, current recommendations are to avoid having a tattoo if the disease is active and they are receiving immunosuppressive treatments. Although scientific data supporting these recommendations are lacking, dermatologists are often reluctant to advocate tattooing in  patients.We aimed to evaluate the frequency of tattoo complications in patients with  and determine whether the occurrence of complications was associated with  status and treatments received at the time of tattooing.We performed a multicentre cross-sectional study. Adults with  were consecutively included and classified as tattooed or non-tattooed. Prevalence of complications associated with tattoos was then evaluated according to  onset and treatments. The study was divided into three parts, in which data were collected through a series of questionnaires filled in by the dermatologist. Complications included pruritus, oedema, allergic reaction/eczema, infection/superinfection, granuloma, lichenification, photosensitivity, Koebner phenomenon and  flare after tattooing. Diagnosis of complications was made retrospectively.We included 2053 psoriatic patients, 20.% had 894 tattoos. Amongst non-tattooed patients, 15.4% had wished to be tattooed, with  being stated as a reason for not having a tattoo by 44.0% and 5.7% indicating that they planned to have a tattoo in the future. Local complications, such as oedema, pruritus, allergy and Koebner phenomenon, were reported in tattoos in 6.6%, most frequently in patients with  requiring treatment at the time of tattooing (P < 0.0001). No severe complications were reported.The rate of tattoo complications in  patients was low. Although the risk of complications was highest amongst patients with  requiring treatment at the time of tattooing, all the complications observed were benign. These results can be helpful for practitioners to give objective information to patients.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545389>Interleukin 10 promotor gene polymorphism in the pathogenesis of .</a></h2><p> is a chronic inflammatory T cell-mediated immunological disease.

We present the case of a patient who was receiving ustekinumab therapy for  which inhibits interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 signalling pathways. The initial presentation was suggestive of encephalitis, but he was discharged prior to the reporting of HSV positivity due to the lack of CSF pleocytosis. On representation, he had worsening symptoms and imaging showed midline shift, indicating cerebral oedema despite the immunosupressant effects of ustekinumab. He required intensive care unit support and treatment with high dose aciclovir and dexamethasone; after a month of treatment he made a good recovery.

This study was designed to investigate the role and related mechanisms of matrine alone and in combination with acitretin in the treatment of  in vitro and in vivo.HaCaT cells were treated with matrine at different concentrations of 0 (blank control), 0., 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mg/mL for 24, 48, 72 h, respectively. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol--yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)--(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium cell viability assay was used to assess the growth and proliferation of HaCaT cells. Cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Expression of protein was detected by Western blotting. Autophagy was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Then HaCaT cells were assigned to normal saline (NS) control group, matrine (0.4 mg/mL) group, acitretin (10 μmol/L) group, and matrine plus acitretin group, and the above methods were repeated. In animal experiments, the cumulative score (erythema, scaling, thickening) as a measure of the severity of inflammation was used to measure the skin performance of mice after treated with matrine 50 mg/kg, acitretin 4.5 mg/kg or combination of the two drugs on the -like mouse models, respectively. Pathological findings of the lesions were observed, and the protein expressions in the lesions were detected by immunohistochemistry.Cell proliferation inhibition was seen in HaCaT cells with treatment of matrine in a dose- and time-dependent manner (P < 0.01, respectively). Cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest was observed in a dose-dependent way (P < 0.01). The expression of p21 (P < 0.05), LC3II/I (P < 0.01), and Beclin 1 (P < 0.01) increased and the expression of cyclin D1 (P < 0.05) decreased with increasing doses of matrine.

Only patients with at least 1 prescription for a biologic medication were included. The time between the first and last prescription in each prescription episode was calculated; at least 1 prescription every 180 days was required to be considered continuous therapy. We also identified a subgroup of patients with prescription episodes of at least 12 months duration in which to evaluate concomitant use of topical medications, phototherapy, and other systemic agents in patients receiving prescriptions for biologics.There were 34,714 eligible  patients. The median time between first and last prescriptions was 3.3 - 7.0 months, depending on the drug and up to 50% of patients that received a prescription for a biologic medication did not receive a second prescription for the same medication. In a subset of patients with prescription episodes of at least 12 months duration, more than 50% continued to receive prescriptions for topical therapies, most commonly topical steroids.Recognition of prescribing patterns associated with biologic medications for  is important to understand healthcare utilization and improve health systems practices for patients and providers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476732>Long-term prognostic value of coronary flow reserve in  patients.</a></h2><p> affects more than 3% of the general population and is associated with an increased risk of premature cardiovascular events and death.

CFR in the left anterior descending coronary artery was detected by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, at rest, and during adenosine infusion. CFR was the ratio of hyperemic to resting diastolic flow velocity. CFR ≤.5 was the cut off to define the presence of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD).CMD was present in 23 patients (15%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that CMD was associated with severe  (OR 3.1, p = 0.03), psoriatic arthritis (OR .9, p = 0.03), hypertension (OR 4.1, p = 0.009), and time elapsing since  diagnosis >6 years (OR 1.9, p = 0.03). Patients with CFR ≤.5 had a lower survival free from events (p < 0.0001).In  patients, CFR may be a reliable prognostic marker for cardiovascular event-free survival and may help identify patients at higher risk of developing cardiovascular complications. Whether novel biologic therapies able to reduce skin disease will improve CMD and prognosis in these patients needs to be further studied, prospectively.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we explored the mechanisms underlying sudachitin-induced apoptosis in HaCaT cells. Sudachitin activated p38MAPK and inhibited ERK1/, whereas another polymethoxyflavone, nobiletin (5,6,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone), activated ERK1/. The p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 significantly attenuated sudachitin-induced heat shock protein 27 phosphorylation, downstream of p38MAPK, and subsequent apoptosis, indicating that sudachitin induces apoptosis via the p38MAPK pathway. Additionally, sudachitin inhibited serum- and EGF-stimulated Raf-1-ERK1/ activation, and blocked EGF-induced cell migration and proliferation in HaCaT cells. These results suggest that small structural differences in polymethoxyflavones can induce different cellular responses by altering the regulation of MAPK activities and that sudachitin may be a potential candidate for developing new drugs for skin diseases such as .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, it has been found that oral microbiota are involved in arthritis pathogenesis. Microbiome composition and its functional implications have been associated with the prevention of bone loss and/or reducing fracture risk. The link between gut-oral microbiota and joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis has been established, and it is now receiving increasing attention in human studies. Recent papers have demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut and oral microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). These alterations resemble those established in systemic inflammatory conditions (inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritides, and ), which include decreased microbial diversity and a disturbance of immunoregulatory properties. An association between abundance of oral  and intestinal  in RA patients compared to healthy controls has been clearly demonstrated. These new findings open important future horizons both for understanding disease pathophysiology and for developing novel biomarkers and treatment strategies. The changes and decreased diversity of oral and gut microbiota seem to play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of RA and OA. However, specific microbial clusters and biomarkers belonging to oral and gut microbiota need to be further investigated to highlight the mechanisms related to alterations in bones and joints inflammatory pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577217>Does psoriatic axial spondyloarthritis phenotype correlate with imaging morphotype?</a></h2><p>To compare the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphology of inflammatory and chronic lesions in the sacroiliac joints (SIJs) and spine between patients with non-psoriatic and psoriatic non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA and p-axSpA, respectively).Patients from the EMBARK trial () with axSpA (n=179) and p-axSpA (n=24) who had MRI data available were compared in terms of baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, and the frequency (n/N [%]) and distribution of inflammatory and structural SIJ and spinal lesions.Patients with p-axSpA were on average older (35.1 years vs. 31.7 years, p=0.047), had a higher occurrence of asymmetric sacroiliitis (54.% vs. 29.6%, p=0.042), and a lower occurrence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positivity (41.7% vs. 73.7%, p=0.010) than patients with axSpA.

It was originally used to indicate religious beliefs, tribal affiliation, loyalty to a leader, or had a therapeutic function. Adverse reactions from tattooing are common, and cutaneous reactions to red pigment have been widely reported (1,). Herein we report a case of a 30-year-old female patient admitted to our Department of Dermatology for a reaction to a tattoo localized at the violet and black areas of the tattoo on the upper part of her left leg. The patient reported that the tattoo had been made two years earlier, but the cutaneous alterations appeared after she decided to change the color from pink to violet. On physical examination, multiple erythematous nodular itching lesions were present at the areas of the tattoo in which the violet and black color were used (Figure 1). She had undergone antibiotic therapy without resolution after which topical corticosteroids were applied with temporary remission of signs and symptoms. Personal and familial medical history were negative. The patient reported a jewelry allergy that had never been investigated. Based on the suspicion of an allergic reaction we decided to execute a patch test SIDAPA series and patch test special tattoo series (copper sulfate 1% water, dimetilaminoazobenzene-p 1%, aminoazotoluene-o 1%, blue scattered 3 1%, blue scattered 124 1%, yellow scattered 3 1%, orange scattered 3 1%, red scattered 1 1%, gentian violet %, cadmium chloride 1% in water, nickel sulphate 5%, iron chloride % in water, potassium dichromate 0.5%, chromium trichloride %, aminoazobenzene-p 0.25%, cobalt chloride 1%, aluminum chloride %, titanium dioxide 0.1%, zinc .5%, mercury chloride 0.05% in water, kathon cg 0.01% in water, phenol 0.5%, ethylenediamine hydrochloride1%, phenylenediamine base-p 1%, formaldehyde 1% in water, phthalic anhydride 1%, rosin 20%, dibutyl phthalate 5%, hexamethylenetetramine 1%, benzophenone 5%). Both series of patch test showed positivity for nickel sulfate 5% at 48 hours (++) and 72 hours (+++). We then performed a 4 mm punch biopsy of the nodular lesions localized at the black and violet areas. The histological examination revealed dermal sclerosis characterized by inflammatory reaction with lympho-mononuclear infiltration in the perivasal zone. Macrophages with red and black pigment were present. The histological pattern was compatible with a granulomatous reaction. Tattooing can result in a wide variety of complications, whose prevalence and incidence still remain unclear. Some authors (3) classify such cutaneous complications in various ways, such as according to: - the length of their evolution: acute and chronic reactions; - the delay of onset after tattooing: early - during the healing phase - or delayed - after tattoo healing; - the type of reaction: infection, hypersensitivity reaction, etc. The practice of tattooing may have local or systemic complications. Dermatoses such as , systemic erythematous lupus, sarcoidosis, lichen planus, and pseudo-epitheliomatous hyperplasia can be localized in the area of the tattoo, but allergic sensitivity to one of the pigments is the most frequent cause of dermatological reactions in the site of tattoo (4,5). In fact, adverse reactions to tattoo pigments, especially the red one, are well-described in literature. Furthermore, these compounds frequently contain components which are not systematically characterized. In our case, the granulomatous reaction did not correspond to an allergic reaction to the pigment. In fact, the patch test was negative for all pigments investigated, only showing a positive result for nickel sulfate. However, the specific and well-defined localization of the nodular lesions on the black and violet areas led us to hypothesize that the tattoo pigments in these areas contained some unknown component causing the reaction. In our opinion, a possible explanation could be that the new pigment that had been used contained a small amount of nickel sulfate, which caused the granulomatous reaction. In conclusion, we presented this clinical case to emphasize the widespread incidence of tattoo-related adverse effects, which are mostly caused by red pigment. Dermatologists should constantly strive familiarize themselves with current research on this practice and its complications. On the other hand, people with potential risk factors for adverse reactions should refer to a specialist before getting tattoos. Tattooists should use a checklist and informed consent to screen people with such potential risk factors. Furthermore, it is necessary to perform additional studies concerning ink and pigment components, with the aim of systemically characterizing the substances used in tattoos. Lastly, as emphasized by our case, patients at risk should referred to the dermatologist not only before getting a new tattoo but also in case of color changes in a pre-existing tattoo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443809>Quality of life, anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with : A case-control study.</a></h2><p>To compare quality of life (QoL), anxiety and depressive symptoms, alcohol consumption and other correlates between patients with  and controls; and to identify features of  associated with lower levels of QoL.Case-control study including 70 subjects with moderate-severe  and 140 controls without .

ECLIPSE is the first comparator study of an IL-23p19 inhibitor, guselkumab, versus an IL-17A inhibitor, secukinumab. The primary objective of this study was to show superiority of clinical response at week 48 for guselkumab versus secukinumab.In this phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, comparator-controlled trial at 142 outpatient clinical sites in nine countries (Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain, and the USA), eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had moderate-to-severe plaque-type , and were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Eligible patients were randomly assigned with permuted block randomisation using an interactive web response system to receive either guselkumab (100 mg at weeks 0 and 4 then every 8 weeks) or secukinumab (300 mg at weeks 0, 1, , 3, and 4, and then every 4 weeks). The primary endpoint, the proportion of patients in the intention-to-treat population who achieved 90% reduction or more from baseline of  Area and Severity Index (PASI 90 response) at week 48, and major secondary endpoints (the proportions of patients in the guselkumab group and in the secukinumab group who achieved a PASI 75 response at both weeks 12 and 48, a PASI 90 response at week 12, a PASI 75 response at week 12, a PASI 100 response at week 48, an Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score of 0 [cleared] at week 48, and an IGA score of 0 or 1 [minimal] at week 48) were to be tested in a fixed sequence to control type I error rate. Safety was evaluated in patients who received one or more doses of study drug from week 0 to 56. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, .This study was done between April 27, 2017, and Sept 20, 2018. 1048 eligible patients were enrolled and, of these, 534 were assigned to receive guselkumab and 514 to receive secukinumab. The proportion of patients with a PASI 90 response at week 48 was greater in the guselkumab group (451 [84%]) than in the secukinumab group (360 [70%]; p<0·0001). Although non-inferiority (margin of 10 percentage points) was established for the first major secondary endpoint (452 [85%] of patients in the guselkumab group vs 412 [80%] of patients in the secukinumab group achieving a PASI 75 response at both weeks 12 and 48), superiority was not established (p=0·0616). Consequently, formal statistical testing was not done for subsequent major secondary endpoints. Proportions of patients with adverse events, infections, and serious adverse events were similar between the two treatments and, in general, safety findings were consistent with registrational trial observations.Guselkumab showed superior long-term efficacy based on PASI 90 at week 48 when compared with secukinumab for treating moderate-to-severe .

K1.3 ion channel is a voltage-gated potassium channel and has been validated as a drug target for autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases like . Here we experimentally test the direct interaction between monoterpenes and K1.3 ion channel. Our electrophysiological analysis determined that monoterpenes (geraniol, nerol, β-citronellol, citral and linalool) have inhibitory effects on K1.3 ion channel. Representatively, geraniol reversibly blocked K1.3 currents in a voltage-dependent manner with an IC of 490.50 ± 1.04 μM at +40 mV in HEK293T cells. At the effective concentrations, geraniol also inhibited cytokine secretion of activated human T cells, including IL-, TNF-α and IFN-γ. In an imiquimod-induced -like animal model, geraniol administration significantly reduced  area and severity index scores, ameliorated the deteriorating histopathology and decreased the degree of splenomegaly. Together, our findings not only suggest that monoterpenes may serve as lead molecules for the development of K1.3 inhibitors, but also indicate that geraniol could be considered as a promising therapeutic candidate to treat autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2018.

Traditional  treatments often cause side effects, drug resistance and complications, necessitating development of safer and more effective treatments. In this study, we screened over 600 natural compounds to identify viability inhibitors of human HaCaT keratinocytes cultured in vitro. The results showed that nitidine chloride was a highly effective inhibitor. Further studies revealed that nitidine chloride inhibited HaCaT proliferation and induced S phase cell cycle arrest; these effects were associated with reduced DNA synthesis, decreased Ki67, cyclin A, and cyclin D1 levels, and increased p53 protein expression. Nitidine chloride also significantly downregulated bcl- and upregulated bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3. Mechanistic studies revealed that nitidine chloride-induced apoptosis involved the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. More importantly, in 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)- and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation models, nitidine chloride inhibited topical edema in mouse ear and back skin, substantially reducing tissue thickness and weight. In some cases, nitidine chloride also ameliorated conditions caused by TPA and IMQ, such as angiogenesis and infiltration of large numbers of inflammatory cells around blood vessels. Additionally, nitidine chloride inhibited the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines in the two animal models. In conclusion, our results are the first to demonstrate that nitidine chloride inhibits the proliferation of HaCaT cells, induces apoptosis partly via the JNK signaling pathway in vitro and ameliorates skin lesions and inflammation in vivo, making it an appropriate candidate for  treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

By inducing glycosuria, SGLT2i predispose to genital infections. In addition, rare occurrence of Fournier's gangrene (FG) has been reported. We aimed to investigate such association through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event (AE) reporting system (FAERS).We mined the FAERS up to 2018q3 (before FDA warning about SGLT2i-associated FG) to retrieve reports including FG as an AE and SGLT2i as suspect or concomitant drugs, and calculated proportional reporting ratios (PRR).We retrieved 47 cases of FG and 17 cases of other severe AEs of the genital area associated with SGLT2i. Patients with FG were ~10 years older than those with other severe genital AEs. Overall, 77% occurred in men. Three patients were concomitantly treated with systemic immunosuppressive drugs. Increased reporting frequency emerged for SGLT2i compared with other drugs, with a PRR ranging from 5 to 10. The disproportional reporting of FG with SGLT2i remained robust and consistently significant when restricting to the period when SGLT2i were available, to reports filed for glucose-lowering medications or for drugs with the diabetes indication, and after refining the definition of FG. FG was disproportionally associated with  and with the combination of immunosuppressants and SGLT2i.Although causality cannot be demonstrated, SGLT2i may predispose to FG and other severe genital AEs. Since the use of SGLT2i is expected to increase significantly, clinicians should be aware of these severe, although rare, AEs and their predisposing factors.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Although it is a multifactorial disease, the genetic factor has a major role in the pathogenesis of . Genome wide association studies have identified over 50 genetic loci associated with  risk. Beside TNF-α or IL-23, the IL-17 family is a newer group that has proven implications in the pathogenesis of . The most important members of the family, with pro-inflammatory qualities, are IL-17A and IL-17F. These interleukins are produced by a varied number of cells, but by far the most important are Th17 cells. Of the patients 20-30% present moderate-to-severe , therefore, systemic medication (phototherapy, methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin or biologic agents) is mandatory. The necessity of an individualized treatment plan, for each patient, is imperative in order to establish the best strategy for non-responders to classical treatment or to other biologic treatments. The discovery of Th17 pathway improved the treatment and prognosis of . Anti-psoriatic agents against IL-17 or its receptors are a novel group of biologic agents; these include ixekizumab, secukinumab and brodalumab. Polymorphisms of IL-17 family have been correlated with the severity and response to treatment in , and also with the risk of inflammatory, infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic pathologies. The significant difference in the presence or absence of susceptibility loci in different population is due to genetic background and environmental factors that have a major impact on disease predisposition.

Here, we aimed to further explore the role and underlying mechanism of miR-125b-5p and miR-181b-5p in . The expression levels of miR-125b-5p, miR-181b-5p and Akt3 mRNA were detected by qRT-PCR assay. Cell proliferation ability was determined by MTT assay and BrdU incorporation assay. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA Immunoprecipitation assay were used to confirm the targeted interaction between miR-125b-5p or miR-181b-5p and Akt3 in human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs). The levels of ki-67, Akt3 protein, Akt, p-Akt, mTOR and p-mTOR were measured by Western blot. Our study indicated that miR-125b-5p and miR-181b-5p were downregulated (about 61.3% with miR-125b-5p and 60.4% with miR-181b-5p) and Akt3 was upregulated (about .68-fold) in . Upregulation of miR-125b-5p or miR-181b-5p resulted in about a 33% or 40% reduction of HEKs proliferation in vitro, while Akt3 overexpression triggered a 1.3-fold enhancement on HEKs proliferation. Akt3 was a direct target of miR-125b-5p or miR-181b-5p. Moreover, HEKs proliferation ability in cotransfection of miR-125b-5p mimics (or miR-181-5p mimics) and vector-Akt3 group was about -fold (or 1.98-fold) that in the miR-125b-5p mimics (or miR-181-5p mimics) alone group.

The nonradiographic axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis diseases' activity has a comparable impact on the patients' quality of life and from the practical point of view the approach to treatment of each of them is the same. The aim: The attempt to identify the reasons of diagnostic delays of AS among patients hospitalized in the Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases Department in Lublin and to suggest the ways of improving the accuracy of diagnostic track among other healthcare providers than rheumatologists.Material and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the records of 82 patients' with the established diagnosis of AS, hospitalized in the Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases Department in Lublin in 2000-2019, and of 45 years of age and older.Results: From among 82 patients (28 women and 54 men) the diagnosis of AS after 45 years of age was established in 25 patients (10 women and 15 men) - group t, and in the other 57 patients (group n) the diagnosis was established before 45 years of age. On average the age at the time of diagnosis in the whole group (t+n) was 40,7±10, (18-76) years, the age at the beginning of inflammatory back pain (age of axial symptoms) was 30,9±8,5 (13-51) years and the diagnostic delay (period between first axial symptoms and diagnosis establishment) was 9,75±9,5 (0-46) years. We did not find any statistically significant associations between sex and age at the moment of diagnosis, age of the beginning of axial symptoms and the time of diagnostic delay. There was no significant difference of incidence of enthesitis, uveitis, arthritis, prevalence of family history of spondyloarthritis and CRP level between group t and n. Antigen HLA B27 was more frequently present in group t.Conclusions: Instead of the recognition progress and worldwide popularization of knowledge about axSpA, the diagnostic delays in this field are still estimated to last many years, the patients are looking for other specialists' help, and they can be not knowledgeable of the inflammatory back pain criteria. Currently, HLA B27 antigen and C-reactive protein are the two most commonly used biomarkers for diagnostic and disease activity monitoring purposes of axSpA and magnetic resonance is the only "imaging biomarker".

This reaction is typically associated with an intense itch at the reaction site. Upon activation, cutaneous mast cells release powerful mediators, such as histamine, tryptase, cytokines, and growth factors that can directly stimulate corresponding receptors on itch-mediating sensory nerves. These include, e.g., H1- and H4-receptors, protease-activated receptor-, IL-31 receptor, and the high-affinity receptor of nerve growth factor (TrkA). On the other hand, sensory nerves can release neuropeptides, including substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide, that are able to stimulate mast cells to release mediators leading to potentiation of the reciprocal interaction, inflammation, and itch. Even though mast cells are well recognized for their role in allergic skin whealing and urticaria, increasing evidence supports the reciprocal function between mast cells and sensory nerves in neurogenic inflammation in chronic skin diseases, such as  and atopic dermatitis, which are often characterized by distressing itch, and exacerbated by psychological stress. Increased morphological contacts between mast cells and sensory nerves in the lesional skin in  and atopic dermatitis as well as experimental models in mice and rats support the essential role for mast cell-sensory nerve communication in consequent pruritus. Therefore, we summarize here the present literature pointing to a close association between mast cells and sensory nerves in pruritic skin diseases as well as review the essential supporting findings on pruritic models in mice and rats.Copyright © 2019 Siiskonen and Harvima.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31463283>Prevalence and predictors of depression among dermatology clinic patients in a teaching hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</a></h2><p>Depression in patients with a skin condition can lead to severe consequences that affect the quality of life.

Guselkumab has demonstrated additional benefit in patients with early inadequate response to ustekinumab. Long-term efficacy comparisons of guselkumab and ustekinumab are currently lacking among ustekinumab-naïve patients.To assess the relative efficacy of guselkumab and ustekinumab for maintenance therapy of moderate-to-severe plaque  using individual patient data (IPD) from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).IPD for guselkumab from the VOYAGE 1 and  trials were pooled and compared with IPD for ustekinumab from the NAVIGATE trial. Multivariable logistic regression analyses compared guselkumab 100 mg and ustekinumab 45/90 mg for the achievement and maintenance of  Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90, 75, and 100 responses up to 40 weeks. The regression models accounted for a range of clinically relevant covariates (e.g., age, sex,  duration). Relative efficacy was expressed using odds ratios (ORs) and predicted probability of treatment response associated with each intervention.Patients receiving guselkumab had significantly higher probabilities of achieving a PASI 90 response compared with patients receiving ustekinumab at both week 16 (70.4% versus 46.0%; OR: .79, 95% CI .22-3.45) and week 40 (74.% versus 54.5%; OR: .40, 95% CI 1.89-3.13). Compared to ustekinumab, guselkumab was also associated with a significantly increased likelihood of achieving both PASI 75 and PASI 100 responses at weeks 16 and 40.Adjusted analyses leveraging IPD demonstrates that guselkumab has a significantly higher probability of achieving and maintaining PASI treatment response through week 40 compared with ustekinumab.© 2019 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544238>Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of childhood vitiligo: a study of 701 patients from Brazil.</a></h2><p>Vitiligo is an acquired pigmentary disorder that affects approximately 0.5-% of the world's population, and 25% of cases begin before 10 years of age.

Serine protease activities are tightly regulated by serine proteases such as kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) and serine protease inhibitors such as lympho-epithelial Kazal-type related inhibitor (LEKTI). For a better understating of diseases' pathogenesis, the regulation mechanism of serine proteases and the inhibitors' expression in epidermal keratinocytes must be clarified.To investigate the effects of the cytokines on the expression of LEKTI in epidermal keratinocytes.Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were stimulated with panels of inflammatory cytokines. The expression of serine protease inhibitors was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. LEKTI expression in normal human skin and lesions from  or atopic dermatitis (AD) were analyzed by immunohistochemically and tape-stripping. Trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like serine protease activities in culture supernatants were measured by using specific substrates.TNF-α and IL-17A significantly induced the expression of LEKTI in NHEKs. The immunohistochemical and tape-stripping analysis revealed that psoriatic skin lesions had higher LEKTI expression compared to normal skin and AD lesions. Trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like protease activities in the culture media were upregulated 3-5 days later but attenuated 6-7 days later period by these cytokines.In epidermal keratinocytes, the Th1&Th17 cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A induce the expression of serine protease inhibitor LEKTI, and it might occur to suppress the increase in the serine protease activities under inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

NAFLD is a metabolic disease with extensive multi-organ involvement, whose extra-hepatic manifestations include type  diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Recently, further evidence has given attention to pathological correlations not strictly related to metabolic disease, also incorporating in this broad spectrum of systemic involvement hypothyroidism, , male sexual dysfunction, periodontitis, and urolithiasis. The most common cause of mortality in NAFLD is represented by cardiovascular disease, followed by liver-related complications. Therefore, clinicians should learn to screen and initiate treatment for these extra-hepatic manifestations, in order to provide appropriate multidisciplinary assessments and rigorous surveillance.

However, desloratadine induces various degrees of sedation side effect in CSU patients, and no biomarkers currently exist for predicting the severity of such side effect. Herein, we evaluated the association between HRH1 gene rs901865 polymorphism and the severity of sedation side effect following desloratadine therapy in patients with CSU. We found that 20 of the 114 patients (17.50%) showed sedation side effect after desloratadine treatment, and 3 patients (.63%) experienced serious sleepiness. The frequency of HRH1 rs901865 G allele was significantly higher in patients who experienced sedation than in patients with rs901865 A allele (p = 0.0009). Moreover, patients with the rs901865 G/G genotype suffered a more serious sedation side effect than patients with the rs901865 G/A genotype (p = 0.005). These results provide evidence that the HRH1 rs901865 G/G polymorphism is associated with severe sedation side effect after desloratadine treatment.

Prolactin and the vascular endothelial growth factor seem to play a key role in  pathogenesis regarding hyperproliferation of epidermal keratinocytes and dermal vascular ectasia. The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  (VEGFR2) and prolactin receptor (PRLR) in psoriatic skin by immunohistochemical analysis and to evaluate the correlation with disease severity. Two skin biopsies, psoriatic lesion and perilesional skin, obtained by punch biopsy from 19 nontreated  patients were examined in hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for TNF-α, VEGFR2 and PRLR. The indirect IHC reaction was carried out automatically and visualized by 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) technique. The average number of DAB-positive cells and the intensity of cell staining were quantified on a predefined scale. The results show a significant difference in the quantity and distribution of TNF-α positive cells in the two sample groups. In psoriatic plaque skin, an increased expression of TNF-α was found in the perivascular dermis and epidermic keratinocytes. In perilesional skin the immunostaining was predominant in the basal layer keratinocytes, while in psoriatic plaque, all the layers were positively marked, with stronger expression at the base. A statistically significant difference was found between the intensity of the immunostaining in the two types of tissue. Positive cells for VEGFR2 and PRL were identified in the basal layer keratinocyte cells (VEGFR2), sweat glands and hair outer shaft sheath (PRLR), without significant differences between the two types of samples. Our findings confirm the importance of TNF-α in  pathogenesis and a positive correlation with lesions severity.

Epicardial adipose tissue inflammation is likely responsible for a distinctive pattern of cardiovascular disorders, consisting of: accelerated coronary atherosclerosis leading to myocardial infarction, atrial myopathy leading to atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic stroke, and ventricular myopathy leading to heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. If cardiovascular inflammation drives these risks, then treatments that focus on blood pressure, lipids and glucose will not ameliorate the burden of cardiovascular disease in patients with , especially in those who are young and have severe inflammation.

Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at baseline, week 4, 8, and 12.At the end of the 8-week treatment period, more than half of subjects had achieved treatment success, with 52.1%, 55.5%, and 58.% of subjects achieving at least a -grade reduction in erythema, plaque elevation and scaling severity on the leg, compared with 15.7% and 22.9%, and 22.% of those treated with vehicle (P<0.001). In addition, overall treatment success (IGA) was achieved in 37.1% of these subjects who had been treated with HP 0.01% lotion compared with 8.4% treated with vehicle (P<0.001); with a corresponding 34.% reduction in baseline BSA and 50.5% change in mean baseline IGAxBSA (both P<0.001 versus vehicle). Overall, a clinically relevant improvement in QoL was achieved by week 4; by week 8 37.7% of subjects where the leg was the target lesion had a clinically meaningful improvement in disease severity (IGAxBSA-75).In conclusion, halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion provides statistically significant efficacy following 8 weeks’ therapy compared with vehicle in subjects where the leg was identified as the target lesion, with clinically relevant improvements in QoL and more than a third of subjects achieving a clinically meaningful result.

We compared personal economic indicators (annual and hourly wages, weekly hours worked, and disability days) between  patients on biologic therapies versus those on oral medications. Using the 2003-2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we performed multivariate linear regression analyses to investigate the relationship between personal economic indicators and  treatment.  The number of U.S. respondents with  who reported using biologic or oral therapies between 2003 and 2015 was ,638,681 (weighted). The mean annual wage among patients on biologics ($52,141.34 [95% CI 40,976-63,306]) was significantly higher than that of patients on oral therapies ($33,584.87 [95% CI 27,687-39,483]) (=.019). The mean weekly hours worked among patients on biologics (43.7 h [95% CI 40.01-47.47]) was significantly higher than that of patients on oral therapies (40.6 h [95% CI 39.66-41.59]) ( = .003). Hourly wage and disability days were not significantly different between the two groups.   patients on biologics earned higher annual wages compared to those on oral therapies, and this is primarily due to the increased number of work hours by those on biologic therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493163>Efficacy, Safety, and Patient-Reported Outcomes in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Plaque  Treated with Brodalumab for 5 Years in a Long-Term, Open-Label, Phase II Study.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammatory diseases such as  require treatment options that maintain efficacy and tolerability during extended treatment.The aim of the study was to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of brodalumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17 receptor A monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque .Patients who completed a 12-week, phase II, dose-ranging clinical trial received brodalumab 210 mg every  weeks in an open-label extension study. Efficacy was assessed by static physician's global assessment (sPGA) and  area and severity index (PASI). Quality of life, assessed by dermatology life quality index (DLQI), and safety were also evaluated.Overall, 181 patients received brodalumab for a median of 264 weeks. Brodalumab treatment resulted in rapid improvements in sPGA, PASI, and DLQI that were maintained through week 264. Achieving PASI 90 to < 100 or PASI 100 at weeks 12, 240, and 264 was associated with greater likelihood for DLQI 0 or 1 compared with achieving PASI 75 to < 90. Over 5 years, one adverse event of suicidal ideation was reported, no suicides occurred, and no new safety signals emerged.Brodalumab demonstrated skin clearance and improved quality of life, with an acceptable safety profile, throughout 5 years of treatment.

Of 34 patients, 26 and 8 patients were men and women, respectively with a mean age of 57.0 ± 8.7 (range, 42.-77.) years. The median age of  onset was 42.7 ± 12.7 (range, 8-67.25) years. With a median follow-up period of 13.6 years, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were found in 67.6% and 29.4% of the patients, respectively. The interferon used for HCV treatment exacerbated the  in 20% of those patients. Conventional treatments and anti-tumor necrosis factors (anti-TNFs) were used in strict collaboration with hepatologists. No patients experienced a worsening of their HCV infection.  Despite a limited number of patients, a male predominance and late-onset  were frequently observed. Although, interferon therapy for HCV can exacerbate , it is not contraindicated.

There is currently no cure for rosacea, and it carries a significant negative psychosocial burden for afflicted patients. While there are a number of treatment modalities at the disposal of the clinician, clinical experience has suggested a need for updated treatments. The pathogenesis of rosacea is multifactorial; however, this paper will focus on the pivotal role of interleukin 17 (IL-17) in the development and progression of the disease. Furthermore, this paper will explore the mechanism of action of standard rosacea treatments and their effect on different stages of the IL-17 pathway. The standard treatments for rosacea are usually effective in controlling the symptoms of the disease in its mild-to-moderate form; however, their efficacy is diminished in the setting of severe and treatment-resistant rosacea. We hypothesize that IL-17 inhibitors, currently used successfully in  and psoriatic arthritis, could perhaps be used to treat severe and treatment-resistant papulopustular rosacea in the future; however, clinical trials and case reports will be needed to dictate expanded indications of IL-17 inhibitors. Furthermore, the high cost of IL-17 inhibitors presently prevents their use in disease states other than  or psoriatic arthritis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384320>Therapeutic management with biological anti-TNF-α agent in severe  associated with chronic hepatitis B: A case report.</a></h2><p>Systemic therapy in patients with concurrent  and chronic hepatitis B is a challenging task for both dermatologists and gastroenterologists since there is a high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and hepatic toxicity under biological therapy. The therapeutic management of a patient with  and infection with the HBV is a challenge as the classical systemic treatment (methotrexate, acitretin, cyclosporine) shows a high risk of immunosuppression and/or hepatic toxicity and the biological therapy is endangered by the possibility of HBV reactivation. We present the case of a patient with moderate-severe  and chronic hepatitis B for whom we assessed the risk-benefit relation and considered useful to initiate the anti-TNF therapy concomitantly with the antiviral therapy with entecavir. The therapeutic algorithm included initiation of anti-TNF therapy with etanercept ×50 mg/week combined with entecavir, an antiviral treatment administered continuously since the diagnosis of the HBV hepatitis, with hepatic function and viral load monitoring. After 3 months of therapy with etanercept the patient was given a dose of etanercept of 50 mg/week combined with entecavir 0.5 mg/day which he continued until week 36 when psoriatic lesions had cleared (PASI=0.6; DLQI=0). No adverse effects were registered and there was no evidence of HBV viral replication or changes in viral markers. We wish to emphasize that the use of etanercept in a patient with  and hepatitis B is a successful therapeutic alternative which may be safely used concomitantly with entecavir, with regular monitoring of viral load and hepatic function tests.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538732>S2k guidelines for the treatment of  in children and adolescents - Short version part .</a></h2><p>The present guidelines are aimed at residents and board-certified physicians in the fields of dermatology, pediatrics, pediatric dermatology and pediatric rheumatology as well as policymakers and insurance funds.

The purpose of this study is to provide a first image of the prevalence, comorbidities, as well as the social impact of  in Romania. We devised a questionnaire, and with the aid of general practitioners throughout the country, delivered it to patients seeking medical care in their office. The questionnaire assessed demographic criteria as well as patient-related issues. It was completed in the presence of the general practitioner, and clear written instructions for completion were included. After statistical analysis, the resulting data formed the basis of this study. The reported prevalence of  in Romania is 5.18%. Almost half of the subjects who completed the questionnaire stated they knew somebody affected by the disease, yet almost a third believed it is a contagious condition. Cardiovascular and psychiatric comorbidities, as well as negative impact on social interactions were reported by the subjects in the study.

Histology shows acanthosis and inflammation with neutrophils and lymphocytes, which are rich in activated T cells. The etiology of  is not well defined, but it appears to be an autoimmune condition or a disease of immune dysregulation. The therapy of  ranges from topical ointments and oral therapies to intravenously or subcutaneously administered biologics. Milder cases can be managed by topical ointments, corticosteroids and vitamin D and retinoid derivatives. Systemic therapy is used for more severe disease or extensive skin involvement. Agents used include psoralen with ultraviolet light, methotrexate, acitretin, phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors (apremilast), cyclosporine or other immunomodulatory agents and, most recently, antitumor necrosis factor agents and monoclonal antibodies directed at activated T cells or their proinflammatory cytokines (secukinumab, ustekinumab).

We initially tried to improve the potency of compound 1, which was found through in-house screening using the human plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)-like cell line CAL-1. The introduction of a chiral methyl moiety at a benzylic position in a center of compound 1 showed a large impact on the inhibitory activity against calcium signaling of ChemR23 induced by the natural ligand chemerin.

However, the tissue-specific mechanisms that control the activation of these innate lymphocytes are not known. Here, we demonstrate that CD109, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein highly expressed by keratinocytes, is an important regulator of skin homeostasis and γδ17 cell activation. Genetic deletion of CD109 results in spontaneous epidermal hyperplasia, aberrant accumulation of dermal-derived γδ17 cells, and enhanced susceptibility to psoriasiform inflammation. In this context, γδ17 activation requires interleukin (IL)-23 signals and is reversed by transient depletion of the skin microbiota. Mechanistically, CD109 restrains γδ17 cell activation in a cell-extrinsic manner by fortifying skin barrier integrity. Collectively, our data provide insight into the regulation of the skin IL-23/IL-17 immune axis and how homeostasis is maintained at this important barrier site.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

An observational study was conducted among mild-to-severe  outpatients. Health status was assessed by the SF-12, which includes a physical (PCS) and a mental (MCS) scale. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to assess the possible presence of depression or anxiety, and the Skindex-17 to measure dermatology-specific HRQoL. Statistical analyses were performed to estimate the association between physical and mental health status and demographic and clinical characteristics. The study population included 1592 patients.  PCS scores were similar to the general population and to non-severe diseases such as allergies, dermatitis, or back pain, while MCS mean scores were very similar to that of depression, and lower than those of all the other chronic conditions. Poor physical health was associated with female sex, older age, lower educational level, joint involvement, ≥ comorbidities, moderate to very severe clinical status, GHQ-12 score ≥4, and moderate to severe Skindex-17 psychosocial scores. Poor mental health was associated with younger age (<30 years), GHQ ≥ 4, and severe Skindex-17 psychosocial scores.

In Chinese medicine practice, HLJDD is commonly prescribed to treat various inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and .The present study aimed at investigating the therapeutic effect of HLJDD extract (HLJDE) and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of action in the 1-chloro-,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD-like mice.Female Balb/c mice were sensitized with DNCB for three days. After sensitization, mice were challenged with DNCB every three days and orally administrated with HLJDE (150, 300 and 600 mg/kg) daily from day 14 to day 29 for consecutive 16 days. At the end of experiment, the clinical AD scores of the mice were calculated to evaluate the therapeutic effect of HLJDE, and serum, ears and dorsal skin of the mice were collected for unravelling molecular mechanisms.HLJDE significantly reduced the clinical symptoms in the AD-like mice by inhibiting eosinophil and mast cell infiltration, suppressing the production of Th2-associated cytokine (IL-4) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α). In addition, HLJDE significantly suppressed the NF-κB and MAPKs pathways. Moreover, HLJDE was able to accentuate filaggrin expression in the skin lesion when compared to the sensitized mouse without treatment.HLJDE significantly improved the AD-like symptoms on the DNCB-sensitized mice through mitigating the production of inflammatory mediators via suppressing MAPKs and NF-κB pathways. Additionally, the elevated expression of filaggrin in the skin lesion by HLJDE contributes to the recovery of dysfunctional skin barrier on the DNCB-sensitized mice.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this brief review is to provide the current status of biosimilars approved in the European Union for dermatological use. We used PubMed for literature search up to June 2018. The keyword 'biosimilars' was searched and 1,691 items were found. From the 1,691 studies, we included 34 articles in our review. Biologics, biosimilars and generics are different types of drugs. Biosimilars are complex molecules produced by a difficult manufacturing process, and changes in product quality may affect its safety and efficacy. Now, there are 9 biosimilar medicines approved by European Medicines Agency (EMA) for plaque  and hidradenitis suppurativa: Amgevita, Solymbic, Cyltezo, Imraldi, Benepali, Erelzi, Flixabi, Inflectra and Remsima, and the number is increasing. In 2005, EMA issued the first guidelines for approval of biosimilars. Next-generation biologics, called 'biobetters', have the same target or mechanism of action as previously approved biologics, but they have structural changes and an improved formulation. The debate over the future of biosimilars is far from being finished. The explosive development of biological therapy and the emergence of biosimilars represent a significant success in the effort to provide advanced healthcare to patients all over the world.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523338>Assessment of Gap Junction Protein Beta- rs3751385 Gene Polymorphism in  Vulgaris.</a></h2><p>Gap junction protein beta  (GJB2) upregulation in  transcriptome analysis as well as connexin 26 (Cx26, encoded by GJB2) expression upregulation in psoriatic plaques has already been substantiated. GJB2 rs72474224 and rs3751385 have been correlated with  vulgaris incidence in Chinese populations. Here we study the effect of rs3751385 in patients suffering from  vulgaris in a Caucasian Greek population at the prefecture of Thrace in Northern Greece.One hundred and seventy-three (111 males and 62 females) psoriatic patients (108 were of early-onset ) and 171 matched controls were included in the study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and genotyping was carried out by polymerase chain reaction-restriction-fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).A statistically significant lower frequency of C/T genotype in late-onset male  vulgaris (P = 0.029) as well as of T allele in female early-onset  vulgaris (P = 0.049) were ascertained.On condition that all other genetic or environmental factors remain stable, the existence and possible interaction between GJB2 rs3751385 C and T alleles in male psoriatic patients may be considered as protective gene component against late-onset  appearance, while presence of the T allele in female might block the histogenetic mechanisms of early-onset  lesions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664747>Evaluation of changes in expression pattern of oxidative stress genes under the influence of adalimumab.</a></h2><p>The  therapy consists of the inhibition of cytokines involved in inducing and development this disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes in the expression of genes related to the oxidative stress phenomenon in the culture of normal human dermal fibroblasts of NHDF exposed to adalimumab. NHDF culture was exposed to adalimumab for , 8, 24 h periods. The control consisted of the same cells not exposed to adalimumab. The oligonucleotide microarrays HG-U133A .0 were used to analyze the changes in gene expression in NHDF culture. Analysis showed that there are 3881 ID mRNA involved in the induction and development of oxidative stress, the expression of which changes significantly due to the exposure of NHDF cells to adalimumab (p <0.05) among 1369 ID mRNA of them. These include genes associated with apoptosis, the p38 MAPK pathway and the PDGF pathway, and above all with pathways not yet classified. Studies have shown that  genes: NR4A2 and IL1RN, whose expression has changed the most, expressed as Fold Change (FC) seem to be the most promising molecular markers to monitor therapy and loss of cell sensitivity to treatment.

Inhibition of cell proliferation is explained through its role in blocking DNA/RNA synthesis, by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, necessary for the production of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides. An anticancer effect can be related to α-oxoaldehyde metabolism (MTX increases methylglyoxal levels). Its anti-inflammatory property is based on the inhibition of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase, thus increasing intracellular and extracellular adenosine, a purine nucleoside with anti-inflammatory effect. This drug can limit inflammation by scavenging free radicals and decreasing malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde protein-adduct production. Moreover, the anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects can also be related to inhibition of the DNA methylation pathway, thus inhibiting methionine formation. The aim of the present study was to report various dermatological cases from our daily practice that demonstrate the efficacy of MTX in the treatment of cutaneous diseases, highlighting different mechanisms of action: its anti-inflammatory effect in  and its anti-proliferative, and anti-neoplastic effect in well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma or in keratoacanthoma. Moreover, different administration pathways and doses are addressed. Assessment of the treatment plan, clinical improvement of cutaneous lesions, biologic evaluation, final aesthetic result, quality of life, as well as potential adverse effects and drug tolerance related to each case mentioned.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390627>Epidemiology and Comorbidities of  among Israeli Adolescents: A Large Cross-Sectional Study.</a></h2><p>Although  can develop at any age, the data regarding its characteristics in adolescents are sparse. This study was designed to determine the  prevalence and its associations with the body mass index (BMI), lipid profile, and comorbidities in adolescents.This was a nationwide population-based cross-sectional retrospective study of adolescents (16-18 years old) evaluated for military service between January 1999 and January 2014.Our database included 887,765 adolescents (57.1% males), of whom 3,112 (0.35%) were diagnosed with . During the 15-year study period, the  prevalence increased by 1.4-fold, from 0.3 to 0.42% (1.25-fold for the males and 1.63-fold for the females). Certain comorbidities, such as contact dermatitis, hyperhidrosis, and arthritis, were significantly associated with  (odds ratios [ORs] of .26, 1.51, and 5.3, respectively). The adolescents with  had significantly elevated BMI and triglyceride values. We found increased ORs of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.25-1.56) and 1.56 (95% CI = 1.32-1.83) for the overweight and obese adolescents, respectively, while a lower BMI (<20) had an opposite effect with  (OR = 0.8).Based on our results, the  prevalence in Israeli adolescents is rising. Dermatological comorbidities and an increased BMI were associated with  in these adolescents. A better understanding of the distinctive epidemiological characteristics of juvenile  may allow for the early detection of comorbidities and improve its management.© 2019 S.

Topicals are considered first-line therapy for mild disease and are having an increasing role in moderate or severe  as an integral part of combination therapy. Halobetasol has been shown be effective in moderate or severe localized plaque , and tazarotene affords important effects on epidermal hyperproliferation that may be important in more severe disease.To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a once-daily application of a fixed combination halobetasol propionate 0.01% and tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) lotion in comparison with its vehicle in patients with severe localized plaque  (as defined by an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of 4 and Body Surface Area (BSA) of 3%-12%.Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies. Sixty-two patients with severe localized  (mean BSA 7.4) randomized (:1) to receive HP/TAZ lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 8 weeks, with a 4-week posttreatment follow-up. Efficacy assessments included treatment success (defined as at least a -grade improvement from baseline in the IGA score and a score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’), impact on individual signs of  (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at the target lesion, BSA, reduction in mean baseline IGAxBSA and achievement of a clinically meaningful response (number of patients who achieved at least a 75% improvement in IGAxBSA). Safety and treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were evaluated throughout.By week 8, 34.8% of patients were treatment successes compared with 0.0% on vehicle (P=0.004). HP/TAZ lotion was also significantly superior in reducing  signs and symptoms and improving BSA. At week 8, 47.4% (erythema), 66.4% (plaque elevation), and 65.4% (scaling) subjects achieved at least a -grade improvement, compared with 14.0% (P=0.016), 14.8% (P<0.001) and 14.7% (P<0.001) respectively with vehicle. Patients treated with HP/TAZ lotion achieved a 32.8% reduction in baseline mean BSA, compared with a 39.6% increase with vehicle (P=0.013). HP/TAZ lotion achieved a statistically significant superior reduction in mean IGAxBSA compared to vehicle from week  (P<0.001 versus vehicle). By week 8, almost half of the patients treated with HP/TAZ lotion achieved a clinically meaningful response (IGAxBSA-75) and a 52.9% reduction in mean IGAxBSA score compared with a 17.5% increase in those patients treated with vehicle (P<0.001). One patient (.6%) treated with HP/TAZ lotion discontinued due to AE. Most frequently reported treatment related AEs were application site pain (7.9%), contact dermatitis (5.3%) and pruritus (5.3%).HP/TAZ lotion provides significantly greater efficacy than vehicle that is both rapid and sustained, in patients with severe localized plaque , with good tolerability and safety over 8 weeks’ once-daily use.

The consequences of obesity in the skin are underestimated. In this paper, we review the effect of obesity on the skin, including how increased body mass index affects skin physiology, skin barrier, collagen structure, and wound healing. Obesity also affects sebaceous and sweat glands and causes circulatory and lymphatic changes. Common skin manifestations related to obesity include acanthosis nigricans, acrochordons, keratosis pilaris, striae distensae, cellulite, and plantar hyperkeratosis. Obesity has metabolic effects, such as causing hyperandrogenism and gout, which in turn are associated with cutaneous manifestations. Furthermore, obesity is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial and Candida skin infections, as well as onychomycosis, inflammatory skin diseases, and chronic dermatoses like hidradenitis suppurativa, , and rosacea. The association between atopic dermatitis and obesity and the increased risk of skin cancer among obese patients is debatable. Obesity is also related to rare skin conditions and to premature hair graying. As physicians, understanding these clinical signs and the underlying systemic disorders will facilitate earlier diagnoses for better treatment and avoidance of sequelae.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

The efficacy and safety of tofacitinib have been shown in several randomized clinical trials. The study presented here aimed to assess the clinical tolerability and effectiveness of tofacitinib among RA patients in real life.  Consecutive patients between January 2015 and April 2017 with RA who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010 criteria were included in a prospectively designed analysis of retrospective data. Patients were initiated on tofacitinib 5 mg bid. The primary objective was to analyze the safety of tofacitinib in a real-life cohort. Safety was assessed by the reasons to stop tofacitinib during follow up and changes of liver enzymes, hemoglobin, and creatinine. The secondary outcome was to analyze the frequency of and time to achieve low disease activity (LDA) and remission as defined by 28 joint count disease activity score (DAS28).  A total of 144 patients were treated with tofacitinib. A total of 84.9% of patients were pre-exposed to at least one biological agent. The average DAS28 at the initiation of tofacitinib was 4.43. A total of 50.0% of patients were positive for rheumatoid factor and 49.0% for ACPA. The mean follow up was 1.22 years (range 10d-3.7a) after initiation of tofacitinib treatment. A total of 94 (64.4%) patients remained on tofacitinib during follow-up. The average time to stop tofacitinib was 190.0 days. Reasons to stop tofacitinib were: insufficient response (n = 23), gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 18), infection ( = 5), myalgia ( = ), remission ( = ), headache ( = ), cough, blue finger syndrome, intolerance, heartburn, , and increased liver enzymes (all  = 1). Increased alanine amino transferase (ALAT) or aspartate amino transferase (ASAT) > × upper limit of normal (ULN) were detected in 3.3% and 4.4% of patients, respectively. Hemoglobin decrease of >10% was detected in 15.1% of the patients and decreased lymphocytes <500/μL in 3.4%. An increase of creatinine >20% was detected in 9.4% of patients. A total of 62.9% and 50.0% of the patients achieved low disease activity (LDA) or remission after a median of 319 and 645 days, respectively. These rates were significantly higher in patients naïve to biologic agents as compared to patients pre-exposed to biologics (LDA: naïve 100% 92 d, pre-exposed 57.0% 434 d, p ≤ 0.001; remission: naïve 86.7% 132 d, pre-exposed 44.1%, 692 d, p = 0.001).  Tofacitinib is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with RA. Tofacitinib may induce high rates of LDA and remission in patients with active disease, even after the use of one or more biologics, though the rate appeared higher in patients naïve to biologics. Tofacitinib may be a valuable option in a treat-to-target approach.

From the clinical point of view, out of the total, 32 joints were swollen while 59 joints were tender. Dactylitis was evidenced in 20/280 examined digits upon physical examination. MUS revealed the presence of synovial proliferation in 108/840 sites (12.85%), with grade 1 synovitis in 4 joints (3.7%), grade  in 94 joints (87.03%) and grade 3 in 10 joints (9.25%). Out of 280 examined fingers 5.71% presented dactylitis, the third digit being the most commonly targeted. Grade  tenosynovitis was found in 40 of the examined tendons, whereas 8 tendons presented with grade 3 tenosynovitis. The most frequently involved were the flexor tendons of the digits (38 out of 40 tendons with inflammatory changes), followed by the extensor carpi ulnaris and flexor carpi radialis tendons.Ultrasound has proven its utility in assessing joint and tendon inflammation to a higher extent that clinically expected. Thus, MUS examination of hand joints may aid the clinician in diagnosing PsA, in evaluating the prognosis and the course of treatment.Copyright © 2019, Medical University Publishing House Craiova.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31386778>ALA-PDT alleviates the  by inhibiting JAK signalling pathway.</a></h2><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a well-known treatment for non-hypertrophic actinic keratoses and superficial basal-cell carcinomas.In this study, we first revealed that ALA-PDT treatment effectively ameliorated the -like lesion in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model and further explored the potential molecular mechanism and related signalling pathways during the treatment. Besides, we also confirmed a significant alleviation of ALA-PDT therapy on IFN-γ-induced over-proliferation of keratinocytes.H&E staining was conducted to reveal the histological changes of mice in different groups. The different expression levels of RNA were illustrated by using QRT-PCR. Western blot was performed to confirm the various expression levels of protein in mice. In vitro, cell proliferation and cell cycle were evaluated by cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry assay, respectively.The result showed that ALA-PDT's anti-proliferation effect and regulation on Socs1/3, JAK1/ and K17 in IFN-γ-induced keratinocytes were largely weakened by NAC, indicating that ALA-PDT attenuated the proliferation of IFN-γ-induced keratinocytes by enhancing ROS level.These results demonstrated that ALA-PDT largely activated the productivity of Socs1/3 in a ROS-dependent manner.

According to the common-sense model (CSM), patients develop illness beliefs when faced with new symptoms, which determine their emotional and behavioural response to the condition. The CSM includes five beliefs: identity, consequence, cause, time line and control. These are important determinants of outcomes and have been shown to influence adherence to medication.A secondary analysis of eight focus groups held across five hospital sites and including 41 participants was undertaken. Participants were sampled for a range of phenotypes and domains of disease activity: men = 20 and women = 21; mean (s.d.): age = 58 (11.4) years; disease duration = 9 (8.3) years; and HAQ = 1 (0.7).The analysis provided evidence to support the existence of the five illness beliefs among patients with PsA and evidence that these representations affected the way patients engaged with their condition. The results showed that many participants experienced high levels of uncertainty in relationship to the illness representation. The role of external social and environmental factors was also shown to influence participants' illness representations and the way they made sense of their PsA.This research highlights a new theme of uncertainty within illness representations and how this impacts on the way in which people living with PsA manage their condition. A greater understanding of the uncertainty that patients might have about their condition and its treatment could provide clinicians with an opportunity to address misinformed illness representations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518445>Phototherapy achieves significant cost savings by the delay of drug-based treatment in .</a></h2><p>Although used for decades in , access to phototherapy is becoming increasingly restricted. Besides patient inconvenience, this is in large part to do with a perception of "high cost." We previously reported a comprehensive analysis of direct and indirect phototherapy treatment cost. However, no robust data exist on the actual savings associated with providing phototherapy in the treatment pathway.To quantify the cost savings achieved by phototherapy by delaying alternative treatments.Costs accruing through the UK-wide established treatment pathway with and without phototherapy were analysed. Direct and indirectly incurred drug treatment costs were calculated using drug tariff, laboratory cost, estate rates and clinic review costs. To enhance reliability, ranges of cost scenarios were calculated by varying parameters such as drug dosing.Medium annual cost savings per patient were £2200 [range: £1800-£2900] for NB-UVB, and £3700 [range: £2500-£5300] if both NB-UVB and PUVA courses were administered, respectively. As the provider treated 656 ± 76 patients per year during the 6-year observational window, this amounted to savings of £Mio .4 [range: £Mio 1.6-£Mio 3.4], even excluding additional non-modelled drug-associated costs (eg diagnostics, adverse event management). Since we only consider cost savings by delay of drug treatment for the duration of phototherapy, drug price reductions through biosimilar introduction only have a small effect. We provide spreadsheets allowing adaptation cost savings projections by varying input variables.Healthcare providers may achieve significant cost savings by implementing and/or widening access to phototherapy.© 2019 The Authors.

IL-17F shares 50% homology and biological activities with IL-17A. It is now of interest to target both cytokines. The objective was to compare the IL-17A and IL-17F effect on cytokine production by RA synoviocytes, and to extend to other cells.  Cells (RA synoviocytes,  skin fibroblasts, endothelial cells, myoblasts, and hepatocytes) were cultured in the presence or not of: IL-17A, IL-17F, TNF, IL-1β alone or their combinations, IL-17A/TNF, IL-17A/IL-1β, IL-17A/TNF/IL-1β, IL-17F/TNF, IL-17F/IL-1β, and IL-17F/TNF/IL-1β. All experiments were performed in parallel to reduce variability. After 48 h, supernatants were recovered and IL-6 and IL-8 levels were measured by ELISA.  IL-17A and IL-17F alone increased significantly IL-6 and IL-8 productions by synoviocytes, with a stronger effect for IL-17A. For IL-6 production, TNF or IL-1β alone had the largest effect on myoblasts (5-fold increase), while for IL-8 production, it was on skin fibroblasts (5-fold increase). The IL-17A/TNF synergistic increase was observed on all cells for IL-6; and for IL-8, except for endothelial cells. For IL-17F/TNF, except with endothelial cells, a synergistic effect was also observed, but less powerful than with IL-17A/TNF. IL-17A/IL-1β or IL-17F/IL-1β effect was cell-type dependent, with an additive effect for synoviocytes (1.6 and -fold increase, respectively for IL-6, and 1.8 and -fold increase, respectively for IL-8) and a synergistic effect for hepatocytes (3.8 and 4.-fold increase, respectively for IL-6, and 6 and -fold increase, respectively for IL-8). The three-cytokine combination induced an additive effect for synoviocytes and a synergistic effect for skin fibroblasts.  IL-17A and IL-17F acted similarly by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, with a stronger response intensity with IL-17A. Their activities were potentiated by the combination with TNF and IL-1β, with an effect dependent on the cell type.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443722>Enthesitis-related arthritis is the most common category of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in Taiwan and presents persistent active disease.</a></h2><p>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) has been categorized into seven different categories according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria. Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) was found to represent the largest category in a Taiwanese cohort study. The aim in this study was to compare the clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of ERA in a single tertiary center in Taiwan, as compared to those of other categories of JIA. Furthermore, we determined patients' characteristics and risk factors that can help assess the outcomes in ERA.A retrospective chart review of all patients with JIA referred to a pediatric rheumatology clinic in the National Taiwan University Hospital between 1993 and 2018 were identified according to ILAR criteria. Outcomes were assessed based on the Wallace criteria to categorize patients into active and non-active, including inactive, remission on medication, and remission off medication, groups. A subset of samples was further tested by DNA sequencing to identify HLA-B27 subtypes.One-hundred and eighty-three patients were included in the study, with a mean of 8 years' follow-up. ERA was the single largest category of JIA (39.9%);  and undifferentiated JIA were both the least common type (0.5%). ERA was male predominant (86%), had a late age of onset (11.0 ± 3. years), and the majority of ERA patients was HLA-B27-positive (97%). Of 25 HLA-B27-positive ERA patients checked by HLA-B27 sequencing, 23 were B*27:04 and  were B*27:05. ERA patients were significantly less likely to achieve non-active status compared to patients with persistent oligoarthritis (P = 0.036). In terms of treatment response to TNF-α inhibitors in methotrexate-refractory ERA, 26 patients remained active and only 11 patients (30%) achieved a non-active status. Sacroiliitis was a risk factor contributing to poorer treatment response in ERA (P = 0.006).ERA represented the most common category of JIA in Taiwan. Those ERA patients with sacroiliitis were likely to have persistent active disease and may require a more aggressive treatment strategy to improve their outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672037>Risankizumab for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Plaque .</a></h2><p> Risankizumab (Skyrizi), an interleukin-23 (IL-23) antagonist, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque  in April 2019.

Because the available treatments for  have significant limitations, dietary products are potential natural sources of therapeutic molecules, which can repair the molecular defects associated with  and could possibly be developed for its management. Fisetin (3,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone), a phytochemical naturally found in pigmented fruits and vegetables, has demonstrated proapoptotic and antioxidant effects in several malignancies. This study utilized biochemical, cellular, pharmacological, and tissue engineering tools to characterize the effects of fisetin on normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and CD4+ T lymphocytes in 2D and 3D -like disease models. Fisetin treatment of NHEKs dose- and time-dependently induced differentiation and inhibited interleukin-22-induced proliferation, as well as activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Fisetin treatment of TNF-α stimulated NHEKs also significantly inhibited the activation of p38 and JNK, but had enhanced effect on ERK1/ (MAPK). In addition, fisetin treatment significantly decreased the secretion of Th1/Th-17 pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN-γ and IL-17A by 12--tetradecanolylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-stimulated NHEKs and anti-CD3/CD28-activated human PBMCs. Furthermore, we established the in vivo relevance of fisetin functions, using a 3D full-thickness human skin model of  (FTRHSP) that closely mimics in vivo human psoriatic skin lesions. Herein, fisetin significantly ameliorated -like disease features, and decreased the production of IL-17 by CD4+ T lymphocytes co-cultured with FTRHSP.

The common expressed plasma exosomal microRNAs in these diseases were determined.The expression of microRNAs derived from plasma exosome of patients with PsA (n=30), PV (n=15), RA (n=15), GA (n=15), and healthy controls (n=15) was evaluated via sequencing. Function analysis of common expressed microRNAs was conducted by the Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Coexpression analysis was conducted to identify novel and significant genes and proteins by using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). A systematic literature review was conducted to uncover the role of the common microRNAs in the pathogenesis of PsA, PV, RA, and GA.A total of 36 common expressed microRNAs were detected in patients with PsA, PV, RA, and GA. The most significantly enriched biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions were "homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules," "CCR4-NOT complex," and "calcium ion binding," respectively. "Antigen processing and presentation" was the most significantly enriched pathway. A total of 91 validated coexpressed gene pairs were identified and 16 common expressed microRNAs and 85 potential target genes were screened based on Cytoscape.

Blood levels of both 1,25(OH)D and 25(OH)D were measured by chemiluminescence (LIAISON XL DIaSorin, Stillwater, MN).The  cohort was middle-aged (mean ± SD: 49.6 ± 13.0), predominantly male (n = 71, 58%), in majority Caucasians (n = 98, 80%), and had moderate-to-severe skin disease [ area severity index score, PASI score, med.5.5 (3.-10.7)], with almost one-fourth of the cohort on biologic  therapy for skin disease management (n = 32, 27%) at baseline. Interestingly, serum levels of 1,25(OH)D but not 25(OH)D were found to be inversely associated with visceral adipose, a marker of cardiometabolic risk in fully adjusted models (β = - 0.43, p = 0.026 and β = -0.26 p = 0.13).

TNF-α expression in HaCaT cells induced by FGF-7 was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In vivo, the BALB/c mouse  model established by topical application of imiquimod (IMQ) was used to determine the role of FGF-7-specific antibody (F-9) in skin inflammation. We found that induction of TNF-α expression by FGF-7 in HaCaT cells was suppressed by FGF-7-specific antibody F-9. Western blot analysis results showed that FGF-7 induced TNF-α expression in HaCaT cells via the FGF receptor  (FGFR2)/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway. In vivo, F-9 could significantly ameliorate the inflammations in a mouse psoriatic model evaluated by  Area and Severity Index scores and ear thickness, which was consistent with the results of hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry assay, and western blot analysis. These results indicate that FGF-7 induces TNF-α expression in HaCaT cells and FGF-7 antibody F-9 alleviates IMQ-induced psoriasiform in mice. Therefore, FGF-7/FGFR2 signaling pathway is a potential target for  treatment.© The Author(s) 2019.

AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with activation of T helper (Th)  and Th17 immunity and a compromised epidermal barrier.The objectives of this study were to examine the expression of PDE4 isoforms in skin from healthy subjects and AD patients, and to determine the effects of apremilast on AD-related inflammatory markers in vitro and in murine models of AD.The expression of PDE4 isoforms (A, B, C, and D) in skin biopsies from healthy subjects and AD patients was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis. Using quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we evaluated the effects of apremilast on gene expression in adult human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKa) stimulated by Th2 and Th17 cytokines, and in two mouse models of antigen-induced AD.Expression of PDE4 isoforms increased up to three-fold in the epidermis of AD patients versus healthy skin. In interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17-stimulated HEKa cells, apremilast significantly changed the expression of ILs, including IL-12/IL-23p40 and IL-31, and alarmins S100A7, S100A8, and S100A12.

In these pathological conditions, selective silencing of activated T cells through physiological receptors they express remains a clinical challenge. In our previous studies we found that activation of dopamine receptors (DRs) in resting human T cells activates these cells, and induces by itself many beneficial T cell functions. In this study, we found that normal human T cells express all types of DRs, and that expression of D1R, D4R and D5R increases profoundly after T cell receptor (TCR) activation. Interestingly, DR agonists shift the membrane potential (V ) of both resting and activated human T cells, and induces instantaneous T cell depolarization within 15 seconds only. Thus, activation of DRs in T cells depolarize these immune cells, alike activation of DRs in neural cells. The skin of  patients contains 20-fold more D1R T cells than healthy human skin. In line with that, 25-fold more D1R T cells are present in  humanized mouse model. Highly selective D1-like receptor agonists, primarily Fenoldopam (Corlopam) - a D1-like receptor agonist and a drug used in hypertension, induced the following suppressive effects on activated T cells of  patients: reduced chemotactic migration towards the chemokine SDF-1/CXCL12; reduced dramatically the secretion of eight cytokines: tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10; and reduced three T cell activation proteins/markers: CD69, CD28 and IL-. Next, we invented a novel topical/dermal Fenoldopam formulation, allowing it to be spread on, and providing prolonged and regulated release in, diseased skin. Our novel topical/dermal Fenoldopam: reduced secretion of the eight cytokines by activated human T cells; reduced IL-1β and IL-6 secretion by human lipopolysaccharide-inflamed skin; eliminated preferentially >90% of live and large/proliferating human T cells. Together, our findings show for the first time that both resting and activated T cells are depolarized instantaneously via DRs, and that targeting D1-like receptors in activated T cells and inflamed human skin by Fenoldopam, in , and potentially in other T cell-mediated diseases, could be therapeutic.

There are growing evidences that signaling via pro-inflammatory cytokines underlie a variety of immunological diseases such as , atopic dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic syndromes, in which cytokine signals are known as a potential therapeutic target of antibody drugs. In contrast, anti-inflammatory cytokines, which is represented by IL-10, largely contribute to suppression of inflammation and restoration of injured tissues. IL-19 is a member of IL-10 cytokine family, which comprises IL-20 cytokine subfamily with IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26. IL-19 is produced by myeloid and epithelial cells with stimulation of bacterial components and cytokines. Although IL-19 has been originally recognized as a potential Th2-related cytokine, in recent researches, it has been reported that this cytokine upregulates Th17 response to reflect and promote progression of Th17-related disease including . On the other hand, IL-19 has anti-inflammatory effects on inflammatory diseases such as infectious skin disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, IL-19 may exert pleiotropic effects dependent on the pathological mechanism of inflammatory diseases.

The present study investigates the efficacy of tryptanthrin, a bioactive compound in indigo naturalis, against non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and the signalling events involved.Efficacy of tryptanthrin against NMSC was assessed using DMBA/PMA-induced skin carcinogenesis model in Swiss albino mice. Immunostaining for PCNA and ki-67 was used to mark proliferating cells in tissues. Haematoxylin and eosin staining and toluidine staining were employed to assess inflammation, and TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis in tissues. The signalling events were evaluated using Western blot, imunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. MTT assay and clonogenic assay were performed to assess the viability and proliferation of cancer cells, in vitro.In mice, topical application of tryptanthrin suppressed skin carcinogenesis. It attenuated inflammation, impeded the proliferation of hair follicle (HF) cells and suppressed the activation of β-catenin, a major driver of HF cell proliferation. Additionally tryptanthrin suppressed the activation of ERK1/ and p38, both of which promote β-catenin activation and lowered the expression of c-Myc and cyclin-D1. Tryptanthrin suppressed the proliferation of the human NMSC cell line, A431 and abrogated EGF-induced activation of β-catenin and subsequent cytoskeletal rearrangement.The study demonstrates with molecular evidence that tryptanthrin is an effective suppressor of NMSC.© 2019 The Authors.
