Optimized structures of the 1:1 complexes and ΔHbinding for calcium binding as calculated by density functional theory (DFT) confirmed in all complexes a stronger calcium binding and shorter calcium- bond length in the deprotonated form. In addition, the stronger calcium binding was also accompanied by a binding site shift from carboxylate binding to chelation by α-amino group and carboxylate  for leucine, aspartate, glutamate, alanine, and asparagine. For binary amino acid mixtures, the calcium-binding constant was close to the predicted geometric mean of the individual amino acid binding constants indicating separate binding of calcium to two amino acids when present together in solution. At high pH, corresponding to conditions for calcium absorption, the binding affinity increased in the order Lys <  < Cys <  < Gly ∼ Ala < Asn < His < Leu < Glu< Asp. In a series of glycine peptides, calcium-binding affinity was found to increase in the order Gly-Leu ∼ Gly-Gly < Ala-Gly < Gly-His ∼ Gly-Lys-Gly < Glu-Cys-Gly < Gly-Glu, an ordering confirmed by DFT calculations for the dipeptides and which also accounted for large synergistic effects in calcium binding for up to 6 kJ/mol when compared to the corresponding amino acid mixtures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27431272>Protection of rat liver against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by a novel selenocysteine-containing 7-mer peptide.</a></h1><p>Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury causes acute organ damage or dysfunction, and remains a problem for liver transplantation. In the I-R phase, the generation of reactive  species aggravates the injury. In the current study, a novel selenocysteine-containing 7‑mer peptide (H--Sec-Gly--Asn-Ala--OH) was constructed to imitate the active site of an antioxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase (GPX). The 7‑mer peptide which has a lower molecular weight, and improved water‑solubility, higher stability and improved cell membrane permeability compared with other GPX mimics. Its GPX activity reached 13 U/µmol, which was 13 times that of ebselen (a representative GPX mimic). The effect of this GPX mimic on I‑R injury of the liver was assessed in rats. The 7‑mer peptide significantly inhibited the increase in serum hepatic amino‑transferases, tissue malondialdehyde, nitric oxide contents, myeloperoxidase activity and decrease of GPX activity compared with I‑R tissue. Following treatment with the 7‑mer peptide, the expression of B‑cell CLL/lymphoma‑2 (Bcl‑2) was significantly upregulated at the mRNA and protein level compared with the I‑R group, as determined by reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. By contrast, Bcl‑2 associated X protein (Bax) was downregulated by the 7‑mer peptide compared the I‑R group. Histological and ultrastructural changes of the rat liver tissue were also compared among the experimental groups. The results of the current study suggest that the 7‑mer peptide protected the liver against hepatic I‑R injury via suppression of ‑derived free radicals and regulation of Bcl‑2 and Bax expression, which are involved in the apoptosis of liver cells. The findings of the present study will further the investigation of the 7-mer peptide as an effective therapeutic agent in hepatic I-R injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29248721>The 3-phenylcoumarin derivative 6,7-dihydroxy-3-[3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl]-coumarin downmodulates the FcγR- and CR-mediated oxidative metabolism and elastase release in human neutrophils: Possible mechanisms underlying inhibition of the formation and release of neutrophil extracellular traps.</a></h1><p>In this study, we report the ability of a set of eight 3-phenylcoumarin derivatives bearing 6,7- or 5,7-dihydroxyl groups, free or acetylated, bound to the benzopyrone moiety, to modulate the effector functions of human neutrophils. In general, (i) 6,7-disubstituted compounds (5, 6, 19, 20) downmodulated the Fcγ receptor-mediated neutrophil oxidative metabolism more strongly than 5,7-disubstituted compounds (21, 22, 23, 24), and (ii) hydroxylated compounds (5, 19, 21, 23) downmodulated this neutrophil function more effectively than their acetylated counterparts (6, 20, 22, 24, respectively). Compounds 5 (6,7-dihydroxy-3-[3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl]-coumarin) and 19 (6,7-dihydroxy-3-[3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl]-coumarin) effectively downmodulated the neutrophil oxidative metabolism elicited via Fcγ and/or complement receptors. Compound 5 also downmodulated the immune complex-stimulated phagocytosis, degranulation of elastase, and production and release of neutrophil extracellular traps, as well as the human neutrophil chemotaxis towards n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, without altering the expression level of formyl peptide receptor type 1. Both compounds 5 and 19 did not impair the neutrophil capacity to recognize and kill Candida albicans. Docking calculations revealed that compounds 5 and 19 directly interacted with three catalytic residues - -91, His-95, and -239 - inside the myeloperoxidase active site. Together, these findings indicate that (i) inhibition of reactive  species generation and degranulation of elastase are closely associated with downmodulation of release of neutrophil extracellular traps; and (ii) compound 5 can be a prototype for the development of novel immunomodulating drugs to treat immune complex-mediated inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of supplemental glutamine (-/+, 0 and 1%) and arginine (-/+, 0 and 0.25%) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Experiment 1 consisted of 8 replicates using 32 pens and focused on live performance to 44 d of age, carcass yield, and meat quality evaluations at 45 d of age. Live performance parameters including feed intake, BW gain, mortality, and feed conversion were evaluated. Post-harvest carcass yield, breast muscle quality (including WB and WS), proximate analysis, and mineral analysis of breast muscle and tibia bone were also evaluated. Experiment 2 comprised 4 replicates using 8 pens with weekly measurements of blood physiology and muscle myopathy development from 21 to 45 d of age. Broilers fed supplemental  and  (+/+) produced broilers with greater BW and improved FCR. The WB and WS severity increased with + diets, while only WB increased using + diets. Weekly observations revealed the greatest increase in WB myopathies occurred between 28 to 35 d, while WS significantly increased one week later (35 to 42 d). When comparing broilers of similar BW at 45 d, + diets resulted in greater WS scores and percentage breast muscle fat. Further analysis of WB and WS scores (independent of treatment affect) revealed that increased myopathy scores were associated with increased blood CO2, H2CO3, and reduced O2 with increased meat pH, moisture content, and Ca concentration. These results indicated that increased muscle Ca is associated with increased WB, while increased dietary glutamine and lack of  may have resulted in a reverse flux of the citric acid cycle and reduced electron transport chain activity resulting in increased WS.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490339>Enteral - Dipeptide Administration Increases Retinal Docosahexaenoic Acid and Neuroprotectin D1 in a Murine Model of Retinopathy of Prematurity.</a></h1><p>Low levels of the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been implicated in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). However, oral DHA suffers from poor palatability and is associated with increased bleeding in premature infants. We asked whether oral administration of the neutraceutical arginine-glutamine (-Glu) could increase retinal DHA and improve outcomes in a mouse model of -induced retinopathy (OIR).Postnatal day 7 (P7) pups were maintained at 75%  for 5 days and then returned to room air on P12. Pups were gavaged twice daily with - or vehicle from P12 to P17 and eyes were harvested for analysis on P17. Vaso-obliteration and vascular density were assessed on retinal flat mounts and preretinal neovascularization was assessed on retinal cross sections. Retinas were used for measurement of DHA and 10,17S-docosatriene (neuroprotectin D1, NPD1), a key DHA-derived lipid, and for analysis by reverse-phase protein array (RPPA).With - treatment, retinal DHA and NPD1 levels were increased in OIR pups. - reduced preretinal neovascularization by 39 ± 6% (P < 0.05) relative to vehicle control. This was accompanied by a restoration of vascular density of the retina in the pups treated with - (73.0 ± 3.0%) compared to vehicle (53.1 ± 3.4%; P < 0.05). - dipeptide restored OIR-induced signaling changes toward normoxia and was associated with normalization of insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 signaling and reduction of apoptosis and an increase in anti-apoptosis proteins.- may serve as a safer and easily tolerated nutraceutical agent for prevention or treatment of ROP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29078103>Ethanol binding sites on proteins.</a></h1><p>This study is on the analysis of ethanol binding sites on 3D structures of nonredundant proteins from the Protein Data Bank. The only one amino acid residue that is significantly overrepresented around ethanol molecules is Tyr. There are usually two or more Tyr residues in the same ethanol binding site, while residues of Thr, Asp and  are underrepresented around them. Residues of Ala and Pro are significantly underrepresented in ethanol binding surfaces. Several residues (Phe, Val, Pro, Ala, , His, Ser, Asp) bind ethanol significantly more frequent if they are not included in beta strands. Residues of Ala, Ile and  preferably bind ethanol when they are included in an alpha helix. Ethanol molecules often make hydrogen bonds with  and nitrogen atoms from the main chain of a protein. Because of this reason, the binding of ethanol may be associated with the decrease of the length of alpha helices and the disappearance of 3/10 helices. Obtained data should be useful for studies on new targets of the direct action of ethanol on enzymes, receptors, and transcription factors.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

With one exception, the active site residues of MDO are identical to bacterial cysteine dioxygenase (CDO). Specifically, the CDO -residue (R50) is replaced by  (Q67) in MDO. Despite this minor active site perturbation, substrate-specificity of Av MDO is more relaxed as compared to CDO. In order to investigate the relative timing of chemical and non-chemical events in Av MDO catalysis, the pH/D-dependence of steady-state kinetic parameters (kcat and kcat/KM) and viscosity effects are measured using two different substrates [3mpa and l-cysteine (cys)]. The pL-dependent activity of Av MDO in these reactions can be rationalized assuming a diprotic enzyme model in which three ionic forms of the enzyme are present [cationic, E((z+1)); neutral, E(z); and anionic, E((z-1))]. The activities observed for each substrate appear to be dominated by electrostatic interactions within the enzymatic active site. Given the similarity between MDO and the more extensively characterized mammalian CDO, a tentative model for the role of the conserved 'catalytic triad' is proposed.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

SK33 proteinase and fractionated using sequential ultrafiltration membranes with molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO) of 30, 5 and 1 kDa, respectively. Four fractions, namely FBSH-I (>30 kDa), FBSH-II (5-30 kDa), FBSH-III (1-5 kDa), and FBSH-IV (<1 kDa), were obtained. All fractions were rich in Lys, Glu/, Gly, Pro, Ala, Asp/Asn, and . FBSH-III and FBSH-IV showed the highest surface hydrophobicity measured by 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) probe (p<0.05). FBSH-III showed the highest antioxidant activity and cytoprotective effects against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-induced cytotoxicity of Caco-2 cells. In addition, FBSH-III inhibited lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and intracellular reactive species (ROS) production in a dose-dependent manner. FBSH-III retained antioxidant activity and cytoprotective capacity after in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion. These results suggested that FBSH-III might potentially be nutraceutical peptides with antioxidative properties.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Because methylation can occur on nitrogen,  and sulfur centers and multiple methylation states exist on the nitrogen centers, methylproteome remains poorly documented. Here we present the methylation by isotope labeled SAM (MILS) strategy for a highly-confident analysis of the methylproteome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on the online multidimensional μHPLC/MS/MS technology. We identified 43 methylated proteins, containing 68 methylation events associated with 64 methylation sites. More than 90% of these methylation events were previously unannotated in Uniprot database. Our results indicated, 1) over 2.6% of identified S. cerevisiae proteins are methylated, 2) the amino acid residue preference of protein methylation follows the order Lys≫>Asp>Asn≈≈His>Glu>Cys, and 3) the methylation state on nitrogen center is largely exclusive. As our dataset covers various types of methylation centers, it provides rich information about yeast methylproteome and should significantly contribute to the field of protein methylation.In this paper, we presented the methylation by isotope labeled SAM (MILS) strategy for a highly-confident analysis of the methylproteome of the yeast S. cerevisiae and collected a comprehensive list of proteins methylated on a set of distinct residues (K, R, N, E, D, Q, H, C).

Enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins can be used to release bioactive fractions and different enzymes have different abilities in releasing such bioactive fractions depending on the enzyme's site of activity on a protein. In this study, several proteases were examined for their ability to release antioxidant peptides from hen egg white and protease P was selected based on the antioxidant activity and the digestion yield of the crude protein hydrolysate. A combination of several purification steps including ultrafiltration with low molecular weight cut-off membranes, cation exchange chromatography and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography was used to purify 'protease P egg white hydrolysate'. Sixteen antioxidant peptides, which were derived from ovalbumin, ovotransferrin and cystatin were isolated from the most active fractions. Amino acid sequences of those peptides were determined using LC-MS/MS.  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values of selected short chain peptides were determined using synthetic peptides. Two peptides AEERYP and DEDTQAMP (Ala-Glu-Glu--Tyr-Pro and Asp-Glu-Asp-Thr--Ala-Met-Pro) showed the highest ORAC values. The results from this study indicate that egg white is rich in antioxidant peptides which can be used as a potential source for preparing bioactive ingredients using enzymatic hydrolysis followed by purification techniques.Copyright © 2015.

Oxidative stress (OS) has been implicated to play a role in its cause; therefore, antioxidants and repair systems may help in restoring oxidant-antioxidant balance. Since polymorphisms in DNA repair genes can result in reduced DNA repair capacity, it is important to investigate its association with OS products to demonstrate the impact of individual susceptibility. Our aim is to examine whether a defect in one of the detoxifying and DNA repair enzyme systems could explain the association between MS and exposure to OS products.We investigated the association of polymorphisms in the metabolizing and DNA repair genes with serum Reactive  Species (ROS) levels. Gene polymorphisms were analyzed by simultaneous multiplex and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism Polymerase Chain Reaction and serum ROS levels were detected.OGG1 Ser/Cys and Ser/Cys+Cys/Cys genotypes had higher MS risk. XRCC1 /+/ genotype increased the risk of MS.Our data suggested that OGG1 Ser326Cys gene polymorphism is a major genetic factor involved in the development of MS. Smoking is also a pivotal confounding factor for subjects with mutant genotypes of XRCC1 Arg399Gln. Further studies are needed to reaffirm our results.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Egg white ovotransferrin-derived tripeptides, IRW (Ile--Trp), IQW (Ile--Trp), or LKP (Leu-Lys-Pro) are previously identified as the inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a key enzyme in the RAS. This study aims at determining whether these peptides are effective in improving insulin resistance, and their mechanisms of action, in a rat derived skeletal muscle cell line (L6 cells).Insulin resistance is induced by treating L6 cells with 1 μm angiotensin II (Ang II) for 24 h. Effects of peptides on glucose uptake are determined using glucose uptake assay, glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation by immunofluorescence, reactive  species (ROS) by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining, while insulin signaling pathway, Ang II receptor (AT1R or AT2R) levels, and NADPH oxidase activation are measured using Western Blot. Only IRW treatment significantly improves insulin resistance in L6 cells via stimulation of insulin signaling. IRW decreases Ang II-stimulated AT1R expression, ROS formation, and NADPH oxidase activation.Of three ACE inhibitory peptides studied, only IRW improves insulin resistance in L6 cells, at least partially via reduced AT1R expression and its anti-oxidative activity.© 2017 The Authors.

All LOX belong to the same gene family, and they are widely distributed. LOX of animals, plants, and prokaryotes contain iron as the catalytic metal, whereas fungi express LOX with iron or with manganese. Little is known about metal selection by LOX and the adjustment of the redox potentials of their protein-bound catalytic metals. Thirteen three-dimensional structures of animal, plant, and prokaryotic FeLOX are available, but none of MnLOX. The MnLOX of the most important plant pathogen, the rice blast fungusMagnaporthe oryzae(Mo), was expressed inPichia pastoris.Mo-MnLOX was deglycosylated, purified to homogeneity, and subjected to crystal screening and x-ray diffraction. The structure was solved by sulfur and manganese single wavelength anomalous dispersion to a resolution of 2.0 Å. The manganese coordinating sphere is similar to iron ligands of coral 8R-LOX and soybean LOX-1 but is not overlapping. The Asn-473 is positioned on a short loop (Asn--Gly-Glu-Pro) instead of an α-helix and forms hydrogen bonds with -281. Comparison with FeLOX suggests that Phe-332 and Phe-525 might contribute to the unique suprafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation mechanism of Mo-MnLOX by controlling  access to the pentadiene radical. Modeling suggests that -525 is positioned close to -182 of 8R-LOX, and both residues likely tether the carboxylate group of the substrate. An  channel could not be identified. We conclude that Mo-MnLOX illustrates a partly unique variation of the structural theme of FeLOX.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146354>A novel calcium-binding peptide from Antarctic krill protein hydrolysates and identification of binding sites of calcium-peptide complex.</a></h1><p>Trypsin was used for preparing peptides with high calcium-binding capacity from Antarctic krill.

Here, using a structural bioinformatics method, we analyzed the active site architecture of the main lignocellulolytic enzyme families. The aromatic amino acids Trp/Tyr and polar amino acids Glu/Asp/Asn// occurred at higher frequencies in the active site architecture than in the whole enzyme structure. And the number of potential subsites was significantly different among different families. In the cellulase and xylanase families, the conserved amino acids in the active site architecture were mostly found at the -2 to +1 subsites, while in β-glucosidase they were mainly concentrated at the -1 subsite. Families with more conserved binding amino acid residues displayed strong selectivity for their ligands, while those with fewer conserved binding amino acid residues often exhibited promiscuity when recognizing ligands. Enzymes with different activities also tended to bind different hydroxyl  atoms on the ligand. These results may help us to better understand the common and unique structural bases of enzyme-ligand recognition from different families and provide a theoretical basis for the functional evolution and rational design of major lignocellulolytic enzymes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29886452>Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes increase the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.</a></h1><p>We investigated the effect of polymorphisms in four DNA repair genes, viz.

The study subjects were comprised of 70 patients suffering from both T2DM and HT and 83 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using ARMS-PCR for XPD Asp312Asn (G>A) and PCR-CTPP for RAD18 Arg302Gln (G>A), APE1 Asp148Glu (T>G) and OGG1 Ser326Cys (C>G). The RAD18 / genotype was found to significantly increase the risk for T2DM and HT by 30 fold. Significant high risk was observed for individuals with XPD Asn/Asn-RAD18 / genotypes. Smoking was found to be the single most important independent risk factor for T2DM and HT. This study concludes that RAD18 Arg302Gln and XPD Asp312Asn polymorphisms might increase the risk for T2DM and HT in association with smoking, tobacco chewing, and/or alcohol consumption, while APE1 Asp148Glu (T>G) and OGG1 Ser326Cys (C>G) polymorphisms do not contribute to such risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28670386>Mutations in mitochondrial tRNA genes may be related to insulin resistance in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a very common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Insulin resistance (IR), a central component of this disease, occurs in 30%-40% of women with PCOS. To date, the molecular mechanism underlying PCOS-IR remains largely unknown. Most recently, increasing evidence has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations plays important roles in the pathogenesis of PCOS-IR. To identify the contribution of mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) mutations in this disease, we screened 80 women with PCOS-IR and 50 healthy control participants for mt-tRNA mutations. After genetic amplification and direct sequencing, we identified nine mt-tRNA mutations that were potentially associated with PCOS-IR: mt-tRNA A3302G and C3275A mutations, mt-tRNA T4363C and T4395C mutations, mt-tRNA C7492T mutation, mt-tRNA A7543G mutation, mt-tRNA A8343G mutation, mt-tRNA T10454C mutation and mt-tRNA A14693G mutation. These mutations were localized at evolutionarily conserved nucleotides and altered the secondary structure of mt-tRNAs, thus resulting in failure of mt-tRNA metabolism. Moreover, molecular and biochemical analysis revealed that levels of 8-OHdG, malondialdehyde and reactive  species were increased in patients with PCOS-IR carrying these mt-tRNA mutations compared with in healthy control participants, whereas superoxide dismutase levels, mitochondrial copy number, membrane potential and ATP levels were significantly reduced. Taken together, our data indicate that mt-tRNAs are key locations for pathogenic mutations associated with PCOS-IR. Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mt-tRNA mutations may be involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS-IR. Thus, our findings provide novel insight into the pathophysiology of this disorder.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30486436>Two Novel Multi-Functional Peptides from Meat and Visceral Mass of Marine Snail  and Their Activities In Vitro and In Vivo.</a></h1><p> () is a marine snail with high nutritional and commercial value; however, little is known about its active peptides. In this study, two multi-functional peptides, YSQLENEFDR (Tyr-Ser--Leu-Glu-Asn-Glu-Phe-Asp-) and YIAEDAER (Tyr-Ile-Ala-Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-), were isolated and purified from meat and visceral mass extracts of  using a multi-bioassay-guided method and were characterized by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Both peptides showed high antioxidant, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory, and anti-diabetic activities, with half-maximal effective concentrations values less than 1 mM. Antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities were significantly higher for YSQLENEFDR than for YIAEDAER. In a zebrafish model, the two peptides exhibited strong scavenging ability for reactive  species and effectively protected skin cells against oxidative damage without toxicity. Molecular docking simulation further predicted the interactions of the two peptides and ACE. Stability analysis study indicated that the two synthetic peptides maintained their activities under thermal stress and simulated gastrointestinal digestion conditions. The low molecular weight, high proportion of hydrophobic and negatively-charged amino acids, and specific C-terminal and N-terminal amino acids may contribute to the observed bio-activities of these two peptides with potential application for the prevention of chronic noncommunicable diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30345154>Catalytic Role of Conserved Asparagine, Glutamine, Serine, and Tyrosine Residues in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis Enzymes.</a></h1><p>We report the results of an investigation into the catalytic role of highly conserved amide (asparagine, glutamine) and OH-containing (serine, tyrosine) residues in several prenyltransferases. We first obtained the X-ray structure of cyclolavandulyl diphosphate synthase containing two molecules of the substrate analog dimethylallyl ()-thiolodiphosphate (DMASPP). The two molecules have similar diphosphate group orientations to those seen in other ζ-fold (- head-to-tail and head-to-middle) prenyltransferases with one diphosphate moiety forming a bidentate chelate with Mg in the so-called S1 site (which is typically the allylic binding site in ζ-fold proteins) while the second diphosphate binds to Mg in the so-called S2 site (which is typically the homoallylic binding site in ζ-fold proteins)  a single P1O1 . The latter interaction can facilitate direct phosphate-mediated proton abstraction  P1O2, or more likely by an indirect mechanism in which P1O2 stabilizes a basic asparagine species that removes H, which is then eliminated  an Asn-Ser shuttle. The universal occurrence of Asn-Ser pairs in ζ-fold proteins leads to the idea that the highly conserved amide (Asn, ) and OH-containing (Tyr) residues seen in many "head-to-head" prenyltransferases such as squalene and dehydrosqualene synthase might play similar roles, in H elimination. Structural, bioinformatics and mutagenesis investigations indeed indicate an important role of these residues in catalysis, with the results of density functional theory calculations showing that Asn bound to Mg can act as a general (imine-like) base, while , Tyr and HO form a proton channel that is adjacent to the conventional (Asp-rich) "active site". Taken together, our results lead to mechanisms of proton-elimination from carbocations in numerous prenyltransferases in which neutral species (Asn, , Ser, Tyr, HO) act as proton shuttles, complementing the more familiar roles of acidic groups (in Asp and Glu) that bind to Mg, and basic groups (primarily ) that bind to diphosphates, in isoprenoid biosynthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26342079>Mapping Key Residues of ISD11 Critical for NFS1-ISD11 Subcomplex Stability: IMPLICATIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MITOCHONDRIAL DISORDER, COXPD19.</a></h1><p>Biogenesis of the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster is an indispensable process in living cells.

Our study maps the important ISD11 amino acid residues belonging to putative helix 1 (Phe-40), helix 3 (Leu-63, -68, -69, Ile-72, Tyr-76), and C-terminal segment (Leu-81, Glu-84) are critical for in vivo Fe-S cluster biogenesis. Importantly, mutation of these conserved ISD11 residues into alanine leads to its compromised interaction with NFS1, resulting in reduced stability and enhanced aggregation of NFS1 in the mitochondria. Due to altered interaction with ISD11 mutants, the levels of NFS1 and Isu1 were significantly depleted, which affects Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, leading to reduced electron transport chain complex (ETC) activity and mitochondrial respiration. In humans, a clinically relevant ISD11 mutation (R68L) has been associated in the development of a mitochondrial genetic disorder, COXPD19. Our findings highlight that the ISD11 R68A/R68L mutation display reduced affinity to form a stable subcomplex with NFS1, and thereby fails to prevent NFS1 aggregation resulting in impairment of the Fe-S cluster biogenesis. The prime affected machinery is the ETC complex, which showed compromised redox properties, causing diminished mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, the R68L ISD11 mutant displayed accumulation of mitochondrial iron and reactive  species, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, which correlates with the phenotype observed in COXPD19 patients.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p></html>
