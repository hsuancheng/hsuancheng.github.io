However, there have not been any reports concerning its anti-diabetic potential until now. Therefore, we evaluated the anti-diabetic potential of didymin via inhibition of α-glucosidase, protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), rat lens aldose reductase (RLAR), human recombinant AR (HRAR), and advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation inhibitory assays. Didymin strongly inhibited PTP1B, α-glucosidase, HRAR, RLAR, and AGE in the corresponding assays. Kinetic study revealed that didymin exhibited a mixed type inhibition against α-glucosidase and HRAR, while it competitively inhibited PTP1B and RLAR. Docking simulations of didymin demonstrated negative binding energies and close proximity to residues in the binding pocket of HRAR, RLAR, PTP1B and α-glucosidase, indicating that didymin have high affinity and tight binding capacity towards the active site of these enzymes. Furthermore, we also examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-diabetic effects of didymin in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells which significantly increased glucose uptake and decreased the expression of PTP1B in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. In addition, didymin activated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 by increasing phosphorylation at  895 and enhanced the phosphorylations of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and glycogen synthasekinase-3(GSK-3). Interestingly, didymin reduced the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase, two key enzymes involved in the gluconeogenesis and leading to a diminished glucose production. The results of the present study clearly demonstrated that didymin will be useful for developing multiple target-oriented therapeutic modalities for treatment of , and -associated complications.© 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566019>Epigenome- and Transcriptome-wide Changes in Muscle Stem Cells from Low Birth Weight Men.</a></h1><p>: Being born with low birth weight (LBW) is a risk factor for muscle insulin resistance and type 2  (T2D), which may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms programmed by the intrauterine environment. Epigenetic mechanisms exert their prime effects in developing cells. We hypothesized that muscle insulin resistance in LBW subjects may be due to early differential epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations in their immature muscle progenitor cells. : Muscle progenitor cells were obtained from 23 healthy young adult men born at term with LBW, and 15 BMI-matched normal birth weight (NBW) controls. The cells were subsequently cultured and differentiated into myotubes. DNA and RNA were harvested before and after differentiation for genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA expression measurements. After correcting for multiple comparisons (q ≤ 0.05), 56 CpG sites were found to be significantly, differentially methylated in myoblasts from LBW compared with NBW men, of which the top five gene-annotated CpG sites () previously have been associated to regulation of cholesterol, fatty acid and glucose metabolism and muscle development or hypertrophy. LBW men displayed markedly decreased myotube gene expression levels of the AMPK-repressing  kinase gene  and the histone deacetylase gene .

The fetuin A molecule, of which serum level increases during pregnancy, is an inhibitor of insulin receptor  kinase and it is associated with insulin resistance. The aim of this study is to research the relationship of -843A>T (rs2248690) and 767C>G (rs4918) polymorphisms in the alpha-2-Heremans Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG) gene which is responsible for the synthesis of fetuin A and its association with (GDM). In this study, 83 pregnant women with GDM who applied to the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinics and 100 normal pregnants enrolled as the control group. Genotyping of AHSG gene polymorphisms was performed by using the TaqMan allelic discrimination kit with real time PCR device. In our study, homozygous GG genotype which was polymorphic in the 767C>G polymorphism of AHSG gene was found significantly low in the patient group ( < .05). Genotype distribution of AHSG gene -843A>T polymorphism was not statistically significant between the patient and control groups ( > .05). Our results showed that homozygous GG variant of AHSG gene 767C>G polymorphism may have protective effect against the development of GDM. Impact statement  Insulin resistance has a central role in the development of gestational  (GDM). The fetuin A molecule is an inhibitor of insulin receptor  kinase and it is associated with insulin resistance. The -843T>A and 767G>C polymorphisms of AHSG gene encoding fetuin A are affects serum fetuin A level. In a single study investigating the relationship between GDM and AHSG gene 767G>C polymorphism, there was no significant difference in genotype distribution but it was reported that the frequency of G allele increased in GDM group and this increase provided a weak risk or predisposition.  The present study revealed that homozygous GG variant of AHSG gene 767C>G polymorphism may decrease the risk of GDM.  Protective effect of homozygous GG variant of AHSG gene 767C>G polymorphism, can be used as a molecular biomarker to predict the development of GDM.

Link (C. militaris) has been used as a folk medicine for treatment of various diseases in China and some other countries. Recent evidence suggests that aqueous extracts of C. militaris have hypoglycemic activity. So the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize compounds with aiti-PTP1B (protein  phosphatase 1B) activity from C. militaris. As a result, cordycerebroside B (1) together with other three known cerebrosides (2-4) and a disaccharide (5) were isolated by silica gel column chromatography and semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and then elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy (MS) and chemical method. Among of which, cordycerebroside B was a new compound and isolated from C. militaris for the first time. The results of the activity assays demonstrated that all these four cerebrosides (compounds 1-4) showed marked inhibition activity against PTP1B with IC values of 4.68 ± 0.18, 16.93 ± 1.08, 10.43 ± 0.64 and 18.92 ± 1.65 μM. All the compounds had no discernible cytotoxicity for Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12 cells).

The several genetic variants of protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22-1123G/C, rs2488457) have been widely examined. We systematically evaluated the association of PTPN22-1123 and RA risk by pooling the related studies conducted in different races.Literature was searched using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Korean scientific database, Chinese medical databases, and the Indian medical database to identify eligible studies for determining the association of PTPN22-1123 and RA risk. The association was assessed in five genetic random effects models including the allelic (AG), recessive (RG), dominant (DG), homozygous (HMG), and heterozygous (HTG) genetic models. Subgroup analyses stratified by ethnicity (Asians and non-Asians) were assessed.A total of 10 articles were selected that met the criteria including Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Subjects included 14 186 healthy controls and 5735 with RA. The AG, RG, DG, and HMG genetic models showed no heterogeneity, but the HTG model showed heterogeneity. AG and RG did not exhibit publication bias in any of the studies including Asian and non-Asian subgroups. The overall effect of PTPN22-1123 on RA risk in all genetic random models showed significant positive associations (AG: odds ratio [OR]: 1.24; CI: 1.08-1.42; P = 0.002; RG: OR: 1.35; CI: 1.15-1.59; P = 0.0003; DG: OR: 1.42; CI: 1.09-1.85; P = 0.009; HMG: OR: 1.69; CI: 1.22-2.34; P = 0.002).

Considerable attention has been focused to the effects of  on these signalling systems. However, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms of these signals are not completely understood in TIDM, but it is likely that hyperglycemia, acidosis, and insulin resistance play significant roles. Insulin maintains normal glycemic levels and it acts by binding to its receptor, so that it activates the receptor's  kinase activity, resulting in phosphorylation of several substrates. Those substrates provide binding/interaction sites for signalling molecules, including serine/threonine kinases and indolamines. For more than two decades, our research has been focused on the mechanisms of protein kinases, CaM Kinase and Serotonin transporter mediated alterations of indolamines in TIDM. In this review, we have also discussed how discrete areas of brain respond to insulin or some of the pharmacological agents that triggers or restores these signalling molecules, and it may be useful for the treatment of specific region wise changes/disorders of diabetic brain.Copyright © 2019.

Hyperglycemia is associated with inflammatory responses in different organs, and diabetic patients have a higher risk of bone fracture due to increased bone weakness. Methylglyoxal, a reactive advanced glycation end product precursor, is known to have increased level in diabetic patients. The accumulation of methylglyoxal promotes inflammation and it may play a role in  related osteoporosis. In this study, therefore, the underlying mechanism of methylglyoxal on osteoporosis was studied using both animal and cell models. In the animal model, rats were treated with either methylglyoxal or saline as control. In the cell model, the macrophage RAW264.7 was treated with methylglyoxal or vehicle control. Following the treatment, animal samples were harvested for micro-CT and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. Cell samples were harvested for MTT assay, RT-PCR, and Western Blotting analyses. In both animals and cell cultures, methylglyoxal was shown to induce osteoclastogenesis by increased gene expression of osteoclast bone biomarkers CTSK, OSCAR and TRACP5. Furthermore, in methylglyoxal-treated macrophages activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases signaling pathway was observed, and inhibition of JNK activities resulted in down-regulation of osteoclast biomarkers gene expressions. Our results therefore suggested that methylglyoxal may contribute to the progression of -related osteoporosis and imbalanced bone remodeling through JNK pathway in osteoclasts.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Liver samples were collected from diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and rats in the control group at 1, 5, and 9 weeks after STZ administration. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H NMR)-based metabolomics was used to examine the metabolic changes during the evolution of DM, and partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) was performed to identify the key metabolites.  We identified 40 metabolites in the H NMR spectra, and 11 metabolites were further selected by PLS-DA model. The levels of α-glucose and β-glucose, which are two energy-related metabolites, gradually increased over time in the DM rats, and were significantly greater than those of the control rats at the three-time points. The levels of choline, betaine, and methionine decreased in the DM livers, indicating that the protective function in response to liver injury may be undermined by hyperglycemia. The levels of the other amino acids (leucine, alanine, glycine, , and phenylalanine) were significantly less than those of the control group during DM development.  Our results suggested that the hepatic metabolic pathways of glucose, choline-betaine-methionine, and amino acids were disturbed during the evolution of , and that choline-betaine-methionine metabolism may play a key role.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30917419>[The association between plasma levels of 20 amino acids and risk of ].</a></h1><p> To investigate the association between the plasma levels of 20 amino acids and the risk of  in middle-aged and elderly population.

They are sources of betalains and phenolic compounds, which have been reported to contribute to human health. The study of the biological activity of different varieties and of their isolated bioactive constitutes is fundamental in the design of functional foods. In this context, our objective is the assessment of the ability of Spanish and Mexican prickly-pear cultivars to inhibit enzymes related to type 2  and the inflammatory response, and the contribution of their bioactive compounds to their nutra-pharmaceutical potential.Prickly pear peels presented the highest antioxidant activity due to their high isorhamnetin glycoside content. Isorhamnetin glycosides showed significantly higher antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity than aglycone, particularly isorhamnetin glucosyl-rhamnosyl-pentoside (IG2), which also reported antihyperglycemic activity. Morada, Vigor, and Sanguinos whole fruits exhibited moderate α-amylase inhibition and higher α-glucosidase inhibition, which is ideal for lowering glucose absorption in hyperglycemia management. Sanguinos peels presented the highest anti-inflammatory activity because of their high indicaxanthin content and isorhamnetin glycoside profile.In the design of prickly pear functional foods, technological processing should prioritize the retention or concentration of these bioactive compounds to preserve (or increase) their natural antioxidant, antihyperglycemic and anti-inflammatory activity.

In addition to insulin secretion, hepatic insulin clearance regulates the homeostatic level of insulin that is required to reach peripheral insulin target tissues to elicit proper insulin action. Receptor-mediated insulin uptake followed by its degradation constitutes the basic mechanism of insulin clearance. Upon its phosphorylation by the insulin receptor  kinase, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) takes part in the insulin-insulin receptor complex to increase the rate of its endocytosis and targeting to the degradation pathways. This review summarizes how this process is regulated and how it is associated with insulin-degrading enzyme in the liver. It also discusses the physiological implications of impaired hepatic insulin clearance: Whereas reduced insulin clearance cooperates with increased insulin secretion to compensate for insulin resistance, it can also cause hepatic insulin resistance. Because chronic hyperinsulinemia stimulates hepatic de novo lipogenesis, impaired insulin clearance also causes hepatic steatosis. Thus impaired insulin clearance can underlie the link between hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Delineating these regulatory pathways should lead to building more effective therapeutic strategies against metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31127272>Arrestin-β-1 Physically Scaffolds TSH and IGF1 Receptors to Enable Crosstalk.</a></h1><p>Endogenously expressed TSH receptors (TSHRs) on orbital fibroblasts of patients with Graves ophthalmopathy (GO) use crosstalk with IGF1 receptors (IGF1R) to synergistically stimulate secretion of hyaluronan (HA), a major component of GO pathology. We previously showed crosstalk occurred upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Because other G protein-coupled receptors engage arrestin-β-1 (ARRB1) and ERK, we tested whether ARRB1 was a necessary component of TSHR/IGF1R crosstalk. HA secretion was stimulated by the TSHR-stimulating monoclonal antibodies M22 and KSAb1, or immunoglobulins from patients with GO (GO-Igs). Treatment with M22, as previously shown, resulted in biphasic dose-response stimulation of HA secretion. The high-potency phase was IGF1R dependent, and the low-potency phase was partly IGF1R independent. KSAb1 produced a monophasic dose-response stimulation of HA secretion, whose potency was lowered >20-fold after IGF1R knockdown. ARRB1 knockdown abolished M22's high-potency phase and lowered KSAb1's potency and efficacy. ARRB1 knockdown inhibited GO-Ig stimulation of HA secretion and of ERK phosphorylation. Last, ARRB1 was shown to be necessary for TSHR/IGF1R proximity. In contrast, ARRB2 knockdowns did not show these effects. Thus, TSHR must neighbor IGF1R for crosstalk in GO fibroblasts to occur, and this depends on ARRB1 acting as a scaffold. Similar scaffolding of TSHR and IGF1R by ARRB1 was found in human osteoblast-like cells and human thyrocytes. These findings support a model of TSHR/IGF1R crosstalk that may be a general mechanism for G-protein-coupled receptor/receptor  kinase crosstalk dependent on ARRB1.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051455>In vitro biological evaluation of anti-diabetic activity of organic-inorganic hybrid gold nanoparticles.</a></h1><p> has been considered as a heterogeneous metabolic disorder characterised by complete or relative impairment in the production of insulin by pancreatic β-cells or insulin resistance.

We show that AF6 is elevated in the liver tissues of dietary and genetic mouse models of . We generated liver-specific AF6 knockout mice and show that these animals exhibit enhanced insulin sensitivity and liver glycogen storage, whereas overexpression of AF6 in wild-type mice by adenovirus-expressing AF6 led to the opposite phenotype. Similar observations were obtained from in vitro studies. In addition, we discovered that AF6 directly regulates IRS1/AKT kinase-mediated insulin signaling through its interaction with Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and its regulation of SHP2's  phosphatase activity. Finally, we show that knockdown of hepatic AF6 ameliorates hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in high-fat diet-fed or  diabetic mice.

We have recently reported that CD28 autonomous signaling induces the expression of IL-17A in peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes from healthy donors, multiple sclerosis, and type 1  patients. Due to the relevance of IL-17A in the pathophysiology of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, we characterized the mechanisms and signaling mediators responsible for CD28-induced IL-17A expression. Here we show that CD28-mediated up-regulation of IL-17A gene expression depends on RelA/NF-κB and IL-6-associated STAT3 transcriptions factors. In particular, we found that CD28-activated RelA/NF-κB induces the expression of IL-6 that, in a positive feedback loop, mediates the activation and nuclear translocation of  phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3). pSTAT3 in turn cooperates with RelA/NF-κB by binding specific sequences within the proximal promoter of human IL-17A gene, thus inducing its expression. Finally, by using specific inhibitory drugs, we also identified class 1A phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) as a critical upstream regulator of CD28-mediated RelA/NF-κB and STAT3 recruitments and trans-activation of IL-17A promoter. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which human CD28 may amplify IL-17A expression in human T lymphocytes and provide biological bases for immunotherapeutic approaches targeting CD28-associated class 1A PI3K to dampen IL-17A-mediated inflammatory response in autoimmune/inflammatory disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657647>Inositol polyphosphate multikinase is a metformin target that regulates cell migration.</a></h1><p>Metformin has been shown to alter cell adhesion protein expression, which is thought to play a role in its observed antitumor properties. We found that metformin treatment down-regulated integrin β1 concomitant with the loss of inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) in murine myocytes, adipocytes, and hepatocytes. To determine if IPMK was upstream of integrin β1 expression, we examined IPMK mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and found that integrins β1 and β3 gene expression was reduced by half, relative to wild-type cells, whereas focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity and Rho/Rac/Cdc42 protein levels were increased, resulting in migration defects. Using nanonet force microscopy, we determined that cell:extracellular matrix adhesion and cell contractility forces were decreased, confirming the functional relevance of integrin and Rho protein dysregulation. Pharmacological studies showed that inhibition of both FAK1 and proline-rich  kinase 2 partially restored integrin β1 expression, suggesting negative regulation of integrin β1 by FAK.

Thus, it is timely to gather together the studies that have characterized and explored the mechanisms associated with the hypertension to take stock of exactly what is known and what remains to be determined. Growing evidence supports the notion that the mechanism of hypertension in BPH/2 mice is predominantly neurogenic with some of the early studies showing aberrant brain noradrenaline levels in BPH/2 compared with BPN/3. Analysis of the adrenal gland using microarray suggested an association with the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Indeed, in support of this, there is a larger depressor response to ganglion blockade, which reduced blood pressure in BPH/2 mice to the same level as BPN/3 mice. Greater renal  hydroxylase staining and greater renal noradrenaline levels in BPH/2 mice suggest sympathetic hyperinnervation of the kidney. Renal denervation markedly reduced the blood pressure in BPH/2 but not BPN/3 mice, confirming the importance of renal sympathetic nervous activity contributing to the hypertension. Further, there is an important contribution to the hypertension from miR-181a and renal renin in this strain. BPH/2 mice also display greater neuronal activity of amygdalo-hypothalamic cardiovascular regulatory regions. Lesions of the medial nucleus of the amygdala reduced the hypertension in BPH/2 mice and abolished the strain difference in the effect of ganglion blockade, suggesting a sympathetic mechanism. Further studies suggest that aberrant GABAergic inhibition may play a role since BPH/2 mice have low GABA receptor δ, α4 and β2 subunit mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, which are predominantly involved in promoting tonic neuronal inhibition. Allopregnanolone, an allosteric modulator of GABA receptors, which increase the expression of these subunits in the amygdala and hypothalamus, is shown to reduce the hypertension and sympathetic nervous system contribution in BPH/2 mice. Thus far, evidence suggests that BPH/2 mice have aberrant GABAergic inhibition, which drives neuronal overactivity within amygdalo-hypothalamic brain regions. This overactivity is responsible for the greater sympathetic contribution to the hypertension in BPH/2 mice, thus making this an ideal model of neurogenic hypertension.Copyright © 2019 Jackson, Head, Gueguen, Stevenson, Lim and Marques.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516339>Molecular analysis of V617F mutation in Janus kinase 2 gene of breast cancer patients.</a></h1><p>Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease with the highest frequency in females.

The  spore surface-display technique is a genetic engineering method that is used to develop new-generation diagnostic kits applicable for the early detection of various types of diseases. In this study, we developed a novel simple, rapid, and inexpensive diagnostic paper-based kit to detect  in urine samples of humans and animals that is applicable for home or laboratory use.

Herein, we show that the Gαs-activating GPCR ligands vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and prostaglandin E (PGE ) transactivate EGFR through increased cell-surface delivery of the EGFR ligand transforming growth factor-α (TGFα) in polarizing madin-darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Caco-2 cells. This is achieved by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of naked cuticle homolog 2 (NKD2), previously shown to bind TGFα and direct delivery of TGFα-containing vesicles to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells. VIP and PGE rapidly activate protein kinase A (PKA) that then phosphorylates NKD2 at Ser-223, a process that is facilitated by the molecular scaffold A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12). This phosphorylation stabilized NKD2, ensuring efficient cell-surface delivery of TGFα and increased EGFR activation. Thus, GPCR-triggered, PKA/AKAP12/NKD2-regulated targeting of TGFα to the cell surface represents a new mode of EGFR transactivation that occurs proximal to ligand cleavage by MMPs.© 2019 The Authors.

Herein, we address the molecular mechanisms affecting endothelium remodeling in disease. Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in patients with ischemic cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disorder, and renal failure, being a common feature in aging, , dyslipidemia, abnormal valve biomechanics, end-stage renal disease and atherosclerosis, a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Oxidative stress promotes calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) by increasing osteogenic transcription factors expression and activity in atherosclerotic plaques. Various markers of osteogenic differentiation are expressed by SMC in calcified atherosclerotic lesions. Interestingly, decreased levels of some bone factors and microRNAs accelerate vascular calcification and injured tissue regeneration. Another key player in endothelial remodeling is amino acids metabolism. Branched-chain amino acids are catabolized in several nonhepatic tissues including cardiac muscle. Immune activation and inflammation in cardiovascular disease patients associate with higher phenylalanine/ ratios. Understanding the whole process that underlies endothelium dysfunction is of paramount importance for the development of new therapeutic approaches.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31333090>Protein  Phosphatase 1B Inhibitors: A Novel Therapeutic Strategy for the Management of type 2 .</a></h1><p> is one of the most common endocrine non-communicable metabolic disorders which is mainly caused either due to insufficient insulin or inefficient insulin or both together and is characterized by hyperglycemia.  emerged as a serious health issue in the industrialized and developing country especially in the Asian pacific region. Out of the two major categories of , type 2  is more prevalent, almost 90 to 95% cases, and the main cause of this is insulin resistance. The main cause of the progression of type 2  has been found to be insulin resistance. The type 2  may be managed by the change in lifestyle, physical activities, dietary modifications and medications. The major currently available management strategies are sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, α-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist. Binding of insulin on the extracellular unit of insulin receptor sparks  kinase of the insulin receptor which induces autophosphorylation. The phosphorylation of the  is regulated by insulin and leptin molecules. Protein  phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) works as a negative governor for the insulin signalling pathways, as it dephosphorylates the  of the insulin receptor and suppresses the insulin signalling cascade. The compounds or molecules which inhibit the negative regulation of PTP1B can have an inductive effect on the insulin pathway and finally help in the management of . PTP1B could be an emerging therapeutic strategy for  management. There are a number of clinical and basic research results which suggest that induced expression of PTP1B reduces insulin resistance.

This functional diversity has made understanding how inositol polyphosphates regulate cellular processes challenging to dissect. However, some inositol phosphates have been unexpectedly found in X-ray crystal structures, occasionally revealing structural and mechanistic details of effector protein regulation before functional consequences have been described. This review highlights a sampling of crystal structures describing the interaction between inositol phosphates and protein effectors. This list includes the RNA editing enzyme "adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA 2" (ADAR2), the Pds5B regulator of cohesin dynamics, the class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC1 and HDAC3, and the PH domain of Bruton's  kinase (Btk). One of the most important enzymes responsible for higher-order inositol phosphate synthesis is inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), which plays dual roles in both inositol and phosphoinositide signaling. Structures of phosphoinositide lipid binding proteins have also revealed new aspects of protein effector regulation, as mediated by the nuclear receptors Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1, NR5A2) and Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2). Together, these studies underscore the structural diversity in binding interactions between effector proteins and inositol phosphate small signaling molecules, and further support that detailed structural studies can lead to new biological discovery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The  phosphatases protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) attenuate leptin and insulin signaling and are elevated in the hypothalami of obese mice. We report that elevated PTP1B and TCPTP antagonize hypothalamic leptin and insulin signaling and contribute to the maintenance of obesity.

However, the mechanisms responsible for selective response of Tregs to low-dose IL-2 is not fully understood. In this study we directly assessed the contribution of CD25 and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in promoting IL-2R signaling in Tregs. IL-2-induced  phosphorylation of STAT5 (pSTAT5) was proportional to CD25 levels on human CD4 T cells and YT human NK cell line, directly demonstrating that CD25 promotes IL-2R signaling. Overexpression of the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) by lentiviral transduction in human Tregs increased the level of IL-2R subunits and promoted  phosphorylation of Jak3 and STAT5. Interestingly, increased expression of CD25 only partially accounted for this enhanced activation of pSTAT5, indicating that PP2A promotes IL-2R signaling through multiple mechanisms. Consistent with these findings, knockdown of PP2Ac in human Tregs and impaired PP2Ac activity in mouse Tregs significantly reduced IL-2-dependent STAT5 activation. In contrast, overexpression or knockdown of PP2Ac in human T effector cells did not affect IL-2-dependent pSTAT5 activation. Overexpression of PP2Ac in human Tregs also increased the expressions of proteins related to survival, activation, and immunosuppressive function, and upregulated several IL-2-regulated genes. Collectively, these findings suggest that CD25 and PP2A cooperatively enhance the responsiveness of Tregs to IL-2, which provide potential therapeutic targets for low-dose IL-2 therapy.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460269>Rubrofusarin as a Dual Protein  Phosphate 1B and Human Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitor: An in Vitro and in Silico Study.</a></h1><p>A number of nature-derived biologically active compounds comprise glycosides. In some cases, the glycosidic residue is needed for bioactivity; however, in other cases, glycosylation just improves some pharmacokinetic/dynamic parameters.

Rubrofusarin showed potent inhibition against the PTP1B enzyme (IC; 16.95 ± 0.49 μM), and its glycosides reduced activity (IC; 87.36 ± 1.08 μM for  and >100 μM for -) than did the reference drug, ursolic acid (IC; 2.29 ± 0.04 μM). Similarly, in hMAO-A inhibition, rubrofusarin displayed the most potent activity with an IC value of 5.90 ± 0.99 μM, which was twice better than the reference drug, deprenyl HCl (IC; 10.23 ± 0.82 μM). An enzyme kinetic and molecular docking study revealed rubrofusarin to be a mixed-competitive inhibitor of both these enzymes. In a western blot analysis, rubrofusarin increased glucose uptake significantly and decreased the PTP1B expression in a dose-dependent manner in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, increased the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS1) (Tyr 895), and decreased the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), key enzymes of gluconeogenesis.

This research aimed to study the changes in whole metabolites before and after exenatide treatment in overweight/obese PCOS patients to gain a better understanding of exenatide for the treatment of PCOS.Sixty-seven women, including 32 with PCOS and 35 age-matched controls, were recruited. The metabolite changes were detected with nontargeted gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (NTGC-MS) before and after exenatide treatment, and changes in clinical biochemical characteristics were also observed.A total of 62 metabolites were differentially expressed between the healthy and PCOS groups, and 31 differentially expressed metabolites were detected before and after exenatide treatment. Abnormal lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism were the main metabolic disorders. Exenatide improved lipid and amino acid metabolism, especially amino acid metabolites. Three types of branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine), two types of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and ) and lysine are important potential metabolites for the therapeutic efficacy of exenatide.

In the present study, the role of spleen  kinase (Syk) and c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK) in NLR family pyrin domain‑containing 3 (NLRP3 inflammasome) activation in DCM were investigated in vivo and in vitro.

The GH-stimulated pathways responsible for this resistance were identified as suppression of apoptosis, induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and upregulated drug efflux by increased expression of ATP-binding cassette containing multidrug efflux pumps (ABC-transporters). In extremely drug-resistant melanoma, ABC-transporters have also been reported to mediate drug sequestration in intracellular melanosomes, thereby reducing drug efficacy. Melanocyte-inducing transcription factor (MITF) is the master regulator of melanocyte and melanoma cell fate as well as the melanosomal machinery. MITF targets such as the oncogene MET, as well as MITF-mediated processes such as resistance to radiation therapy, are both known to be upregulated by GH. Therefore, we chose to query the direct effects of GH on MITF expression and activity towards conferring chemoresistance in melanoma. Here, we demonstrate that GH significantly upregulates MITF as well as the MITF target genes following treatment with multiple anticancer drug treatments such as chemotherapy, BRAF-inhibitors, as well as -kinase inhibitors. GH action also upregulated MITF-regulated processes such as melanogenesis and tyrosinase activity. Significant elevation in MITF and MITF target gene expression was also observed in mouse B16F10 melanoma cells and xenografts in bovine GH transgenic (bGH) mice compared to wild-type littermates. Through pathway inhibitor analysis we identified that both the JAK2-STAT5 and SRC activities were critical for the observed effects. Additionally, a retrospective analysis of gene expression data from GTEx, NCI60, CCLE, and TCGA databases corroborated our observed correlation of MITF function and GH action. Therefore, we present in vitro, in vivo, and in silico evidence which strongly implicates the GH-GHR axis in inducing chemoresistance in human melanoma by driving MITF-regulated and ABC-transporter-mediated drug clearance pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31215652>Relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and severity of chronic periodontitis in type 2 diabetic patients: A cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D ), a newly emerged immune regulator, is considered to be involved in type 2 diabetic periodontitis (T2DCP). However, the risk factors and genes with altered expression that influence the progression and severity of T2DCP remain unknown. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between 25(OH)D deficiency and severity of T2DCP as well as the potential mechanisms.A total of 182 subjects were divided into two groups: chronic periodontitis without  (P group, n = 88) and type 2  with periodontitis (DM+P group, n = 94). Patients in both groups were further classified according to age as young (Y) and elderly (E) for a total of four groups: P/Y, P/E, DM+P/Y, and DM+P/E. Periodontal status was evaluated based on the probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss (CAL). The serum levels of human 25(OH)D , interleukin (IL)-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the expression of protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and JAK/STAT proteins in the gingival tissue.Serum 25(OH)D levels were lower in the DM+P group than those in the P group (P < 0.001). When the patients were subgrouped according to age, 25(OH)D deficiency was more commonly found in DM+P/E than in DM+P/Y (67% vs 51%), with a significant difference detected in the 25(OH)D quartile of 15-20 ng/mL (P = 0.007). The 25(OH)D level showed a significant negative correlation with fasting blood glucose (FBG) (r = -0.623), serum IL-1β (r = -0.392), serum TNF-α (r = -0.218), PD (r = -0.269), and CAL (r = -0.305) in the DM+P group (all P < 0.05), but not with hemoglobin A1c (P = 0.123). Additionally, reduced VDR and PTPN2 expression levels were observed in DM+P patients, whereas JAK1 and p-STAT5 protein levels were increased in this group.Vitamin D deficiency is strongly associated with T2DCP, and age mediates this relationship. Abnormal FBG and IL-1β levels should be considered as important potential risk factors for the progression and severity of T2DCP. Moreover, 25(OH)D deficiency may be related to the immune function of T2DCP by weakening PTPN2 signaling.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

By modulating multiple substrates, PTPN12, a member of the proline-, glutamic acid-, serine- and threonine-rich (PEST) family of PTPs, is an important regulator of cell migration and adhesion. According to its newly identified roles and functions, PTPN12 is considered a promising therapeutic target against critical diseases, including cancer, , metabolic disease and autoimmune diseases. In this review, we provide an overview of PTPs and discuss the critical roles of PTPN12/PTP-PEST in tumor progression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AP (orphan code ORPHA 282196) is defined as the autoimmune-induced failure of at least two glands. AP is divided into the rare juvenile type I and the adult types II to IV. The prevalence is 1:100,000 and 1:20,000 for types I and types II to IV, respectively. Whereas type I (ORPHA 3453) is a monogenetic syndrome with an autosomal recessive transmission related to mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene, types II to IV are genetically complex multifactorial syndromes that are strongly associated with certain alleles of HLA genes within the major histocompatibility complex located on chromosome 6, as well as the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 and the protein  phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 genes. Addison disease is the major endocrine component of type II (ORPHA 3143), whereas the coexistence of type 1  and autoimmune thyroid disease is characteristic for type III (ORPHA 227982). Genetic screening for the AIRE gene is useful in patients with suspected type I, whereas serological screening (i.e., /adrenal antibodies) is required in patients with monoglandular autoimmunity and suspected AP. If positive, functional endocrine testing of the antibody-positive patients as well as serological screening of their first-degree relatives is recommended.Timely diagnosis, genetic counseling, and optimal long-term management of AP is best offered in specialized centers.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532707>Inhibitory B cell co-receptors and autoimmune diseases.</a></h1><p>B cells express various inhibitory co-receptors including CD22 (also known as Siglec-2), Siglec-10 (Siglec-G in mice), CD72, LILRB (PIR-B in mice) and FcγRIIB that contain immunoreceptor -based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) in the cytoplasmic region and negatively regulate BCR signaling by recruiting phosphatases to the ITIMs. Some of the inhibitory B cell co-receptors suppress development of SLE. Among these, CD72 most strongly regulates SLE. CD72 recognizes Sm/RNP, a lupus self-antigen and an endogenous TLR7 ligand, as a specific ligand, and suppresses B cell response to this TLR7 ligand. This suppression may inhibit development of SLE because TLR7 is indispensable in multiple mouse SLE models. In contrast, inhibitory B cell co-receptors such as CD22 and CD72 inhibit expansion of regulatory B cells that are known to regulate development of autoimmune diseases including type 1  (T1D) and multiple sclerosis. CD72 strongly exacerbate development of T1D in NOD mice probably by limiting expansion of regulatory B cells. Thus, inhibitory B cell co-receptors especially CD72 regulates distinct autoimmune diseases either positively or negatively. As B cell depletion therapy clearly reveals crucial roles of B cells in the regulation of various autoimmune diseases, CD72 may be a novel therapeutic target for treatment of autoimmune diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640116>Age- and BMI-Associated Expression of Angiogenic Factors in White Adipose Tissue of Children.</a></h1><p>The growth of adipose tissue and its vasculature are tightly associated. Angiogenic factors have been linked to obesity, yet little is known about their expression during early childhood. To identify associations of angiogenic factors with characteristics on individual and tissue level, subcutaneous white adipose tissue samples were taken from 45 children aged 0-9 years undergoing elective surgery. We measured the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEFGA), fibroblast growth factor 1 and 2 (FGF1, FGF2), angiopoietin 1 and 2 (ANGPT1, ANGPT2), TEK receptor  kinase (TEK), and von Willebrand factor (VWF). In addition, we determined the mean adipocyte size in histologic tissue sections. We found positive correlations of age with FGF1 and FGF2 and a negative correlation with ANGPT2, with pronounced differences in the first two years of life. FGF1, FGF2, and ANGPT1 correlated positively with adipocyte size. Furthermore, we identified a correlation of ANGPT1 and TEK with body mass index-standard deviation score (BMI-SDS), a measure to define childhood obesity. Except for ANGPT2, all angiogenic factors correlated positively with the endothelial marker VWF. In sum, our findings suggest that differences related to BMI-SDS begin early in childhood, and the analyzed angiogenic factors possess distinct roles in adipose tissue biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30918868>Effect of sub-toxic chlorpyrifos on redox sensitive kinases and insulin signaling in rat L6 myotubes.</a></h1><p>Sub-chronic exposures to chlorpyrifos, an organophosphorus pesticide is associated with incidence of . Biochemical basis of chlorpyrifos-induced  is not known. Hence, effect of its sub-toxic exposure on redox sensitive kinases, insulin signaling and insulin-induced glucose uptake were assessed in rat muscle cell line.In an in vitro study, rat myoblasts (L6) cell line were differentiated to myotubes and then were exposed to sub-toxic concentrations (6 mg/L and 12 mg/L) of chlorpyrifos for 18 h. Then total anti-oxidant level in myotubes was measured and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was assayed. Assessment of activation of NFκB & p38MAPK and insulin signaling following insulin stimulation from  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and serine phosphorylation of Akt were done in myotubes after chlorpyrifos exposure by western blot (WB) and compared with those in vehicle-treated controls.The glucose uptake and total antioxidant level in L6-derived myotubes after sub-toxic exposure to chlorpyrifos were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. As measured from band density of WB, phosphorylation levels increased for redo-sensitive kinases (p38MAPK and IκBα component of NFκB) and decreased for IRS-1 (at  1222) and Akt (at serine 473) on insulin stimulation following chlorpyrifos exposure as compared to those in controls.We conclude that sub-toxic chlorpyrifos exposure induces oxidative stress in muscle cells activating redox sensitive kinases that impairs insulin signaling and thereby insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle cells. This probably explains the biochemical basis of chlorpyrifos-induced insulin resistance state and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614143>Neurotensin receptors regulate transactivation of the EGFR and HER2 in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner.</a></h1><p>Neurotensin is a 13 amino acid peptide which is present in many lung cancer cell lines. Neurotensin binds with high affinity to the neurotensin receptor 1, and functions as an autocrine growth factor in lung cancer cells. Neurotensin increases  phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the neurotensin receptor 1 antagonist SR48692 blocks the transactivation of the EGFR. Here the effects of reactive oxygen species on the transactivation of the EGFR and HER2 were investigated. Using non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, neurotensin receptor 1 mRNA and protein were present. Using NCI-H838 cells, neurotensin or neurotensin but not neurotensin increased EGFR, ERK and HER2  phosphorylation which was blocked by SR48692. Neurotensin addition to NCI-H838 cells increased significantly reactive oxygen species which was inhibited by SR48692, Tiron (superoxide scavenger) and diphenylene iodonium (DPI inhibits the ability of NADPH oxidase and dual oxidase enzymes to produce reactive oxygen species). Tiron or DPI impaired the ability of neurotensin to increase EGFR, ERK and HER2  phosphorylation. Neurotensin stimulated NSCLC cellular proliferation whereas the growth was inhibited by SR48692, DPI or lapatinib (lapatinib is  kinase inhibitor of the EGFR and HER2). Lapatinib inhibited the ability of the neurotensin receptor 1 to transactivate the EGFR and HER2. The results indicate that neurotensin receptor 1 regulates the transactivation of the EGFR and HER2 in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31065046>Serum amino acid profiles and risk of type 2  among Japanese adults in the Hitachi Health Study.</a></h1><p>Amino acids have emerged as novel biomarkers for predicting type 2  (T2D), but the epidemiologic data linking circulating amino acid profiles with T2D are sparse in Asian populations. We conducted a nested case-control study within a cohort of 4,754 nondiabetic Japanese employees who attended a comprehensive health checkup in 2008-2009 and agreed to provide blood samples. During a 5-year follow-up, incident T2D cases were ascertained based on plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and self-report. Two controls matched to each case on sex, age, and the date of serum sampling were randomly selected by using density sampling, resulting in 284 cases and 560 controls with amino acid measures. High concentrations of valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, , alanine, glutamate, ornithine, and lysine were associated with an increased risk of incident T2D, in a linear manner. High glutamine concentrations were associated with a decreased risk of incident T2D. Further adjustment for the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance attenuated these associations. Overall, these amino acids may be novel useful biomarkers in the identification of people at risk of T2D before overt symptoms. Insulin resistance may account for or mediate the relationship between these amino acids and risk of incident T2D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100493>Biomarkers of cadmium, lead and mercury exposure in relation with early biomarkers of renal dysfunction and : Results from a pilot study among aging Canadians.</a></h1><p>Cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) are known nephrotoxicants that have been associated with the risk of developing type-2  (T2D). The aim of this pilot study was to explore relations between biomarkers of Cd, Pb and Hg exposure, early urinary biomarkers of renal dysfunction (kidney-injured molecule-1 (KIM-1), N-acetylglucosaminidase and retinol-binding protein (RBP)) and plasma biomarkers deemed predictive of the risk of developing T2D (adiponectin, leptin, branched-chain and aromatic amino acids), among 70 participants (age range: (46-87 yrs)) from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) with normal glycemic control (glycated haemoglobin ≤ 6.5%) in all but four of them. Significant (p < 0.05) Spearman correlation coefficients were obtained between: plasma adiponectin and RBP (r = 0.42), urinary Cd (r = 0.32), blood Cd (r = 0.36); KIM-1 and CdU (r = 0.33) as well as HgU (r = 0.37); RBP and isoleucine (r = -0.28), leucine (r = -0.33),  (r = -0.3) and valine (r = -0.44); CdU and isoleucine and valine (r = -0.27 for both). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that some T2D-related biomarkers are confounders of associations between RBP and Hg or Cd biomarkers. Path analyses support a mediating effect of adiponectin on the relation between urinary Cd and RBP. Concluding, this pilot study originally investigated a comprehensive set of biomarkers on complex interactions between toxic metal exposure, renal function and T2D in a group of aging Canadians. Its findings warrant further investigation of longitudinal data in a greater number of participants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

IR binds insulin at the cell surface and transduces rapid signaling via cytoplasmic kinases. However, mechanisms mediating long-term effects of insulin remain unclear. Here, we show that IR associates with RNA polymerase II in the nucleus, with striking enrichment at promoters genome-wide. The target genes were highly enriched for insulin-related functions including lipid metabolism and protein synthesis and diseases including , neurodegeneration, and cancer. IR chromatin binding was increased by insulin and impaired in an insulin-resistant disease model. Promoter binding by IR was mediated by coregulator host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) and transcription factors, revealing an HCF-1-dependent pathway for gene regulation by insulin. These results show that IR interacts with transcriptional machinery at promoters and identify a pathway regulating genes linked to insulin's effects in physiology and disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore we have investigated bioactive compounds from marine organisms such as marine sponges, ascidians, and marine-derived microorganisms. This review consists of two topics based on marine natural product chemistry. (1) Protein  phosphatase (PTP) 1B plays a key role as a negative regulator in the insulin and leptin signaling pathways. Accordingly, the development of PTP1B inhibitors is expected to provide new drugs for type 2  and obesity. We have been searching for new types of PTP1B inhibitors among marine organisms and identified various PTP1B inhibitors from marine sponges and fungi. This review presents their structural diversities and unique biological properties. (2) In the course of our studies on the induced production of new fungal metabolites, the Palauan marine-derived fungus, Trichoderma cf. brevicompactum TPU199, was found to produce the unusual epipolythiodiketopiperazines, gliovirin and pretrichodermamide A. Long-term static fermentation of the strain induced production of a new dipeptide, dithioaspergillazine A, whereas fermentation of the strain with NaCl, NaBr, and NaI produced the Cl and Br derivatives of pretrichodermamide A and a new iodinated derivative, iododithiobrevamide, respectively. Moreover, DMSO-added seawater medium induced the production of diketopiperazine with the unprecedented trithio-bridge, chlorotrithiobrevamide. This fermentation study on the strain as well as the structures of the metabolites obtained are described in this review.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31127818>Effect of Macronutrient Type and Gastrointestinal Release Site on PYY Response in Normal Healthy Subjects.</a></h1><p>Enteroendocrine L cells release satiety inducing hormones in response to stimulation by luminal macronutrients. We sought to profile the differential effect of macronutrient type and site of release on circulating concentrations of the L cell-derived enteroendocrine hormone peptide   (amino acids 1 to 36) (PYY).Eight healthy volunteers were recruited to a randomized, double-blinded, six-way crossover study. At each visit, the participants consumed a 500-kcal drink containing carbohydrate, protein, or fat in either gastric or small intestinal release formulations. Plasma PYY concentrations and hunger ratings were assessed for 3 hours after consumption of the test drink. The food intake was recorded thereafter at an ad libitum lunch.Microcapsular formulations targeting the distal small intestinal delivery of fat, but not carbohydrate or protein, markedly enhance PYY release relative to macronutrient delivery in gastric release formulations. Food intake at an ad libitum meal was lowest after consumption of the formulation releasing fat at the distal small intestine.Targeting of fat to the distal small intestine in delayed release microcapsules enhanced PYY release and was associated with reductions in food intake.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309546>Egr-1 transcriptionally activates protein phosphatase PTP1B to facilitate hyperinsulinemia-induced insulin resistance in the liver in type 2 .</a></h1><p>During the development of type 2  (T2DM), hyperinsulinemia is the earliest symptom. It is believed that long-term high insulin stimulation might facilitate insulin resistance in the liver, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Herein, we report that hyperinsulinemia could induce persistent early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) activation in hepatocytes, which provides negative feedback inhibition of insulin sensitivity by inducing the expression of protein  phosphatase-1B (PTP1B). Deletion of Egr-1 in the liver remarkably decreases glucose production, thus improving systemic glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mechanistic analysis indicates that Egr-1 inhibits insulin receptor phosphorylation by directly activating PTP1B transcription in the liver. Our results reveal the molecular mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia accelerates insulin resistance in hepatocytes during the progression of T2DM.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179345>Distinct Effects of Carrageenan and High-Fat Consumption on the Mechanisms of Insulin Resistance in Nonobese and Obese Models of Type 2 .</a></h1><p>Exposure to low concentration of the common food additive carrageenan (10 mg/L) for only six days led to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in the C57BL/6J mouse. Longer exposure produced fasting hyperglycemia but with no increase in weight, in contrast to the HFD. Glucose intolerance was attributable to carrageenan-induced inflammation and to increased expression of GRB10. Both HFD and carrageenan increased p(Ser32)-IB and p(Ser307)-IRS1, and the increases were greater following the combined exposure. The effects of carrageenan were inhibited by the combination of the free radical inhibitor Tempol and BCL10 siRNA, which had no impact on the HFD-mediated increase. In contrast, the PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin blocked the HFD-induced increases, without an effect on the carrageenan-mediated effects. HFD had no impact on the expression of GRB10. Both carrageenan and high fat increased hepatic infiltration by F4/80-positive macrophages. Serum galectin-3 and galectin-3 binding to the insulin receptor increased by carrageenan and by HFD.  phosphorylation of the insulin receptor declined following either exposure and was further reduced by their combination. Carrageenan reduced the activity of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (ARSB; arylsulfatase B), which was unchanged following HFD. Dietary exposure to both high fat and carrageenan can impair insulin signaling through both similar and distinct mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30917487>The Role of  Phosphorylation of Protein Kinase C Delta in Infection and Inflammation.</a></h1><p>Protein Kinase C (PKC) is a family composed of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases that are master regulators of inflammatory signaling. The activity of different PKCs is context-sensitive and these kinases can be positive or negative regulators of signaling pathways. The delta isoform (PKCδ) is a critical regulator of the inflammatory response in cancer, , ischemic heart disease, and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies implicate PKCδ as an important regulator of the inflammatory response in sepsis. PKCδ, unlike other members of the PKC family, is unique in its regulation by  phosphorylation, activation mechanisms, and multiple subcellular targets. Inhibition of PKCδ may offer a unique therapeutic approach in sepsis by targeting neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions. In this review, we will describe the overall structure and function of PKCs, with a focus on the specific phosphorylation sites of PKCδ that determine its critical role in cell signaling in inflammatory diseases such as sepsis. Current genetic and pharmacological tools, as well as in vivo models, that are used to examine the role of PKCδ in inflammation and sepsis are presented and the current state of emerging tools such as microfluidic assays in these studies is described.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513948>Inhibition of vascular neointima hyperplasia by FGF21 associated with FGFR1/Syk/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Neointima hyperplasia is the pathological basis of atherosclerosis and restenosis, which have been associated with  (DM). Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a potential diabetic drug, however, it has not been investigated whether FGF21 prevents neointima hyperplasia in DM.Vascular neointima hyperplasia was induced in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) combined with low dose streptozotocin (STZ) administration. In vitro, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were incubated with high glucose (HG, 30 mM). VSMC proliferation and migration, as well as formation of NLRP3 inflammasome, were assessed.We found that FGF21 significantly inhibited neointima hyperplasia and improved endothelium-independent contraction in the wire-injured common carotid artery (CCA) of diabetic mice. In vitro, the proliferation and migration of HG-treated VSMCs were shown as remarkable increase of PCNA, cyclin D1, MMP2 and MMP9, as well as cell migration through wound healing and transwell migration assays. Such abnormal changes were dramatically reversed by FGF21, which mimicked the role of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 and caspase-1 inhibitor WEHD. Moreover, along with more NLRP3, ASC oligomer and their colocalization, the release of active caspase-1(p20) and IL-1β was significantly inhibited by FGF21 in VSMCs exposed to HG. Furthermore, FGF21 suppressed phosphorylation of spleen  kinase (Syk) via FGFR1, which regulated NLRP3 inflammasome through ASC phosphorylation and oligomerization.We demonstrated that potential protection of FGF21 on VSMCs proliferation and migration was associated with inhibition of FGFR1/Syk/NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in the improvement of neointima hyperplasia in diabetic mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It has been demonstrated that dyslipidemia can alter the reproductive function. Animal models have recently been used to show that the offspring of dyslipidemic males could also develop such pathologies and that the transgenerational transmission involved post-testicular sperm maturation. These data targeted the essential role of male gamete epididymal maturation and its importance for the health of the offspring.This publication summarizes in the first place experimental data obtained using a mouse model of dyslipidemia-induced post-testicular infertility, knockout mice for the two isoforms of the 'Liver X Receptors' (Lxrα;β ), the major regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. The impact of a high cholesterol diet (HCD) on the protein YWHAZ (14-3-3 ζ or  3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein Zeta) was also investigated in our model.In our mouse model, when young fertile Lxrα;β males aged three months were fed four weeks with a HCD, they developed an epididymal phenotype leading to infertility. The level of sperm YWHAZ was evaluated by Western blot and its  phosphorylation state by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot.Our data revealed that sperm lipid composition and structure were altered, leading to defects of the capacitation-associated signaling pathway. They also showed that both the level and the  phosphorylation state of YWHAZ were affected by the HCD in sperm cells from Lxrα;β males.YWHAZ could be a new important regulator of capacitation-associated  phosphorylation and a marker of dyslipidemia-induced infertility.© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136297>Implementation of a novel self-induced promoter for the expression of pharmaceutical peptides in Escherichia coli: YY(3-36) peptide.</a></h1><p>Background Increasing the expression rate of recombinant mammalian hormones in Escherichia coli by combining efficient promoters and signal sequences is a never ending process. A self-induced promoter will have some beneficial gains compared to the classical T7 promoter or its variants with isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as the inducer. Obesity is the prime suspect in widespread frequency of  type II and cardiovascular diseases worldwide. YY (-) peptide is a local acting hormone, controlling appetite. Excitingly, it was has been shown that a truncated version of the YY peptide, YY(3-36) peptide, has potential as a worthy biopharmaceutical agent in the fight against obesity. Materials and methods To develop an economical expression system for the large scale production of the peptide in Gram-negative bacteria, we introduced a promoter sequence upstream of a chimeric gene for the extracellular expression of this peptide with the assistance of a signal sequence of asparaginase II from E. coli. This system has the advantage of producing a complete sequence of a truncated YY peptide, YY(3-36), without any extra tags that would require further removal with the assistance of expensive specific proteases and reduced the downstream steps, significantly. Results Recombinant production of YY(3-36) peptide under a self-induced promoter proves the efficacy of the asparaginase II signal sequence as a communicator of foreign peptides and proteins into the extracellular space of E. coli. Conclusions The application of fusion protein expression of biopharmaceuticals, especially mammalian hormones, in prokaryotic systems with the help of native signal sequences makes some common tags with expensive proteases for the removal of the attached protein Tag redundant.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31131274>Akt-ing Up Just About Everywhere: Compartment-Specific Akt Activation and Function in Receptor  Kinase Signaling.</a></h1><p>The serine/threonine kinase Akt is a master regulator of many diverse cellular functions, including survival, growth, metabolism, migration, and differentiation. Receptor  kinases are critical regulators of Akt, as a result of activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling leading to Akt activation upon receptor stimulation. The signaling axis formed by receptor  kinases, PI3K and Akt, as well as the vast range of downstream substrates is thus central to control of cell physiology in many different contexts and tissues. This axis must be tightly regulated, as disruption of PI3K-Akt signaling underlies the pathology of many diseases such as cancer and . This sophisticated regulation of PI3K-Akt signaling is due in part to the spatial and temporal compartmentalization of Akt activation and function, including in specific nanoscale domains of the plasma membrane as well as in specific intracellular membrane compartments. Here, we review the evidence for localized activation of PI3K-Akt signaling by receptor  kinases in various specific cellular compartments, as well as that of compartment-specific functions of Akt leading to control of several fundamental cellular processes. This spatial and temporal control of Akt activation and function occurs by a large number of parallel molecular mechanisms that are central to regulation of cell physiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585268>Identification of lipid-like salicylic acid-based derivatives as potent and membrane-permeable PTP1B inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Developing protein  phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) inhibitors is an important strategy to treat type 2  (T2DM).

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory bone disorder that presents with bone pain and localized swelling.  mice, isolated from a mutagenesis screen, exhibit a spontaneous inflammatory paw phenotype that includes sterile osteomyelitis and systemic reduced bone mineral density. To elucidate the molecular basis of the disease, positional cloning of the causative gene for  was attempted. Using a candidate gene approach, a missense mutation in the C-terminal region of , a member of Src family  kinases (SFKs), was identified. For functional confirmation, additional mutations at the N terminus of  were introduced in  mice by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. N-terminal deleterious mutations of  abolished the inflammatory phenotype in  mice, but in-frame and missense mutations in the same region continue to exhibit the phenotype. The fact that  null mutant mice are morphologically normal suggests that the inflammation in this model depends on Fgr products. Furthermore, the levels of C-terminal negative regulatory phosphorylation of Fgr  are distinctly reduced compared with that of wild-type Fgr. In addition, whole-exome sequencing of 99 CRMO patients including 88 trios (proband and parents) identified 13 patients with heterozygous coding sequence variants in , including two missense mutant proteins that affect kinase activity. Our results strongly indicate that gain-of-function mutations in  are involved in sterile osteomyelitis, and thus targeting SFKs using specific inhibitors may allow for efficient treatment of the disease.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

The mechanisms whereby BPD/DS exerts its positive metabolic effects have however yet to be fully delineated. The objective of this study was to distinguish the effects of the two components of BPD/DS, namely the sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and the DS derivation, on gut microbiota, and to appraise whether changes in microbial composition are linked with surgery-induced metabolic benefits.BPD/DS, DS, and SG were performed in Wistar rats fed a standard chow diet. Body weight and energy intake were measured daily during 8 weeks post-surgery, at which time glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide   (PYY), insulin, and glucose were measured. Fecal samples were collected prior to surgery and at 2 and 8 weeks post-surgery. Intraluminal contents of the alimentary, biliopancreatic, and common limbs (resulting from BPD/DS) were taken from the proximal portion of each limb. Fecal and small intestinal limb samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.BPD/DS and DS led to lower digestible energy intake (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0002, respectively), reduced weight gain (P < 0.0001) and body fat mass (P < 0.0001), improved glucose metabolism, and increased GLP-1 (P = 0.0437, SHAM versus DS) and PYY levels (P < 0.0001). These effects were associated with major alterations of both the fecal and small intestinal microbiota, as revealed by significant decrease in bacterial richness and diversity at 2 (P < 0.0001, Chao1 index; P < 0.0001, Shannon index) and 8 weeks (P = 0.0159, SHAM versus DS, Chao1 index; P = 0.0219, SHAM versus DS, P = 0.0472, SHAM versus BPD/DS, Shannon index) post-surgery in BPD/DS and DS, and increased proportions of Bifidobacteriales (a 60% increase in both groups) but reduced Clostridiales (a 50% decrease and a 90% decrease respectively), which were mostly accounted at the genus level by higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in both the fecal and intestinal limb samples, as well as reduced abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae in the small intestine. Those effects were not seen in SG rats.The metabolic benefits following BPD/DS are seemingly due to the DS component of the surgery. Furthermore, BPD/DS causes marked alterations in fecal and small intestinal microbiota resulting in reduced bacterial diversity and richness. Our data further suggest that increased abundance of Bifidobacterium and reduced level of two Clostridiales species in the gut microbiota might contribute to the positive metabolic outcomes of BPD/DS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339082>Protein  Phosphatase (PTP1B): A promising Drug Target against life threatening ailments.</a></h1><p>Protein  phosphatases are enzymes which help in signal transduction in , obesity, cancer, liver diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.

We investigated the effect of the 21 isolated compounds and metabolites ( and ) of  against the inhibition of PTP1B and α-glucosidase enzymes. All fatty acids showed potent PTP1B inhibition at low concentrations. In particular, new compound  and fucosterol epoxide () showed noncompetitive inhibitory activity against PTP1B.

Although often expressed as an increase in insulin concentration, the disease is characterized by a decrease in insulin action. This increased workload of the pancreas and the consequent decompensation are not only the main mechanisms for the development of type 2  (T2D), but also exacerbate the damage of metabolic diseases, including obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, metabolic syndrome, and others. Many clinical trials have suggested the potential role of herbs in the treatment of insulin resistance, although most of the clinical trials included in this review have certain flaws and bias risks in their methodological design, including the generation of randomization, the concealment of allocation, blinding, and inadequate reporting of sample size estimates. These studies involve not only the single-flavored herbs, but also herbal formulas, extracts, and active ingredients. Numerous of  and  studies have pointed out that the role of herbal medicine in improving insulin resistance is related to interventions in various aspects of the insulin signaling pathway. The targets involved in these studies include insulin receptor substrate, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, glucose transporter, AMP-activated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3, mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB, protein  phosphatase 1B, nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Improved insulin sensitivity upon treatment with herbal medicine provides considerable prospects for treating insulin resistance.

Chemotherapeutic agents are used in the treatment of cancer, but in most cases, patients develop resistance. Phenformin, an oral biguanide drug used to treat type 2 , was removed from the market due to a high risk of fatal lactic acidosis. However, it has been shown that phenformin is, with other biguanides, an authentic tumor disruptor, not only by the production of hypoglycemia due to caloric restriction through AMP-activated protein kinase with energy detection (AMPK) but also as a blocker of the mTOR regulatory complex. Moreover, the addition of phenformin eliminates resistance to antiangiogenic  kinase inhibitors (TKI), which prevent the uncontrolled metabolism of glucose in tumor cells. In this review, we evidence the great potential of phenformin as an anticancer agent. We thoroughly review its mechanism of action and clinical trial assays, specially focusing on current challenges and future perspectives of this promising drug.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154588>Receptor  kinases (RTKs) consociate in regulatory clusters in Alzheimer's disease and type 2 .</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2  (T2D) share the common hallmark of insulin resistance. It is conjectured that receptor  kinases (RTKs) play definitive roles in the process. To decipher the signaling overlap behind this phenotypic resemblance, the activity status of RTKs is probed in post-mortem AD and T2D tissues and cell models. Activities of only about one-third changed in a similar fashion, whereas about half of them showed opposite outcomes when exposed to contrasting signals akin to AD and T2D. Interestingly, irrespective of disease type, RTKs with enhanced and compromised activities clustered distinctly, indicating separate levels of regulations. Similar regulatory mechanisms within an activity cluster could be inferred, which have potential to impact future therapeutic developments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212940>Consumption of a Specially-Formulated Mixture of Essential Amino Acids Promotes Gain in Whole-Body Protein to a Greater Extent than a Complete Meal Replacement in Older Women with Heart Failure.</a></h1><p>Heart failure in older individuals is normally associated with a high body mass index and relatively low lean body mass due to, in part, a resistance to the normal anabolic effect of dietary protein. In this study we have investigated the hypothesis that consumption of a specially-formulated composition of essential amino acids (HiEAAs) can overcome anabolic resistance in individuals with heart failure and stimulate the net gain of body protein to a greater extent than a commercially popular protein-based meal replacement beverage with greater caloric but lower essential amino acid (EAA) content (LoEAA). A randomized cross-over design was used. Protein kinetics were determined using primed continuous infusions of L-(H)phenylalanine and L-(H) in the basal state and for four hours following consumption of either beverage. Both beverages induced positive net protein balance (i.e., anabolic response). However, the anabolic response was more than two times greater with the HiEAA than the LoEAA ( < 0.001), largely through a greater suppression of protein breakdown ( < 0.001). Net protein accretion (g) was also greater in the HiEAA when data were normalized for either amino acid or caloric content ( < 0.001). We conclude that a properly formulated EAA mixture can elicit a greater anabolic response in individuals with heart failure than a protein-based meal replacement. Since heart failure is often associated with obesity, the minimal caloric value of the HiEAA formulation is advantageous.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171456>Evolution of nutritional status and survival in patients with cancer on  kinase inhibitors treatment.</a></h1><p>Treatment with oral antineoplastic agents known as  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is new and, thus, little is known about their impact on nutritional status (NS), dietary intake, quality of life, and survival. The aim of this study was to provide information on these components in order to guide future nutritional recommendations.A prospective, observational study in adults who start treatment with TKIs, in whom NS was assessed using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), anthropometric measures, biochemical parameters, and dietary intake (24-hour dietary recall). The EORTC QLQ-C30 was used to assess quality of life. Nonparametric tests were used in statistical analysis, and survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank curves.Of the overall sample, 21.7% had moderate malnutrition according to PG-SGA, and 74.2% moderate weight loss at 6 months, but no patient had BMI<18.5kg/m. Patients with moderate malnutrition had lower survival at four years of diagnosis (log-rank=0.015). Energy intake was lower than recommended by the ESPEN 2017 congress, and no patient covered the protein requirements (1.5g protein/kg weight) during follow-up. A worse score on the global health scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30 was related to worse NS.Treatment with TKIs does not appear to have a significant impact on NS and quality of life after 6 months of follow-up. Malnutrition should be prevented through individualized nutritional advice because it is related to shorter survival.Copyright © 2019 SEEN y SED. Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U.

Identification of PTP1B active site inhibitors has proven to be difficult with none of them clearing the phase II clinical trials. Since the conventional methods of targeting the active site of PTP1B have failed to bring out effective PTP1B inhibitors as potential drugs, recent studies are focussing on identification of potential allosteric inhibitors of PTP1B with better specificity and activity. A complete understanding of the molecular features dynamically involved for allosteric site inhibition is still uncertain, and hence, this study is aimed at evaluating the allosteric effectiveness of six natural compounds isolated from medicinal plants which showed in vitro antidiabetic activity along with PTP1B inhibition. The allosteric binding and inhibition of these compounds are studied using computational methods such as molecular docking, homology modelling and molecular dynamics simulations for a timescale of 100 ns. The molecular dynamics simulations of native PTP1B, along with the modelled allosteric α-7 helix, for a timescale of 100 ns, revealed the spontaneous transition of the native PTP1B from open WPD loop (active) to closed WPD loop (inactive) conformations during the simulations. Similar dynamics was observed in the presence of the active site substrate pTyr (phosphotyrosine), whereas this transition was inhibited in the presence of the compounds at the allosteric site. Results of molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis reveal that the hindrance to WPD loop was mediated through structural interactions between the allosteric α-helical triad with Loop11 and WPD loop. The MM-PBSA (Molecular Mechanics - Poisson Boltzmann with Surface Area solvation) binding energy results along with H-bonding analysis show the possible allosteric inhibition of Aloe emodin glycoside (AEG), 3β-taraxerol (3BT), chlorogenic acid (CGA) and cichoric acid (CHA) to be higher in comparison with (3β)-stigmast-5-en-3-ol (SGS) and methyl lignocerate (MLG). The interaction analysis was further validated by scoring the allosteric complexes before and after MD simulations using Glide. These findings on spontaneous PTP1B fluctuations and the allosteric interactions provide a better insight into the role of PTP1B fluctuations in impacting the binding energy of allosteric inhibitors towards optimal drug designing for PTP1B.

Especially, compound 8b showed the best inhibitory activity (IC50 = 1.0 μM) with 15-fold selectivity for PTP1B over the closely related T-cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP). Cell viability assays indicated 8b is cell permeable with lower cytotoxicity. Molecular modeling and dynamics studies revealed the reason of selectivity for PTP1B over TCPTP.

The further MOA study of PTP1B demonstrated that compounds 4b is a substrate-competitive inhibitor. The binding mode analysis suggested that compound 4b simultaneously occupies the active site and the second phosphotyrosine (pTyr) binding site of PTP1B. Furthermore, the cell viability assay of compound 4b showed tolerable cytotoxicity in L02 cells, thus 4b may be prospectively used to further in vivo study.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

For lenvatinib arterial thromboembolic events are listed as adverse events of special interest with lenvatinib. In the phase III study, arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 3% of lenvatinib-treated patients and 1% in the placebo group. Most of the patients had predisposing factors. Only one myocardial infarct was reported in the lenvatinib phase III study. We report a 73-year-old female patient with metastatic thyroid papillary carcinoma who was treated with total thyroidectomy. The operation was followed by four radioiodine therapies over a period of 6 years. At 6 years she developed lung metastasis without radioiodine uptake, one solitary liver metastasis and one solitary right renal metastasis. One year after the first diagnosis of radioiodine resistant lung metastasis the lung metastasis showed progression according to RECIST criteria. This treatment was resulting in prolonged partial response with disappearance of a hepatic and renal metastasis. A myocardial infarction occurred after 39 months of lenvatinib treatment resulting in implantation of 3 stents and a two chamber pacemaker. The treatment was discontinued. Except for well controlled hypertension there were neither predisposing diseases like  nor symptoms of cardiac ischemia on exertion. However, the family history for cardiovascular diseases was positive for cardiac infarction reported for one brother. Another brother was treated for hypertension and the patient's mother suffered from a cerebral infarction at the age of 60. While only one myocardial infarct was reported in the lenvatinib phase III study with 392 patients this case suggests that long-term treatment with lenvatinib may be associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarct also in patients with no predisposing diseases except well controlled hypertension and positive family history for cardiovascular diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611073>Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) regulatory subunits and their roles in signaling and disease.</a></h1><p>The Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a group of heterodimeric lipid kinases that regulate crucial cellular processes including proliferation, survival, growth, and metabolism. The diversity in functions controlled by the various catalytic isoforms (p110α, p110β, p110δ, and p110γ) depends on their abilities to be activated by distinct stimuli such as receptor  kinases (RTKs), G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and the Ras family of small G-proteins. A major factor determining the ability of each p110 enzyme to be activated is the presence of regulatory binding partners. Given the overwhelming evidence for the involvement of PI3Ks in diseases such as cancer, inflammation, immunodeficiency and , an understanding of how these regulatory proteins influence PI3K function is essential.

Protein kinases are ubiquitous intracellular and cell surface proteins that play critical roles in cell signaling pathways involved in metabolism, injury responses, adaption, growth and differentiation. They act by adding a phosphate group to a protein (phosphorylation), usually on a specific amino acid which often makes the protein or enzyme "active". The human genome has more than 500 protein kinases and they can be classified as (1) , (2) serine-theonine or (3) nonspecific (both), based upon their amino acid specificity. Many protein kinases are cell surface receptors and act to initiate an intracellular pathway of activation, after the receptor is engaged by its ligand, typically a cytokine or growth factor. Inhibitors of these kinases are called protein kinase receptor inhibitors. Other kinases are intracellular and take part in cell signaling. These kinases can be targeted by "non-receptor" protein kinases. Finally, some kinase inhibitors have specificity for multiple kinases and are called "multi-kinase inhibitors." Protein kinases can be specifically involved in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation and mutations may lead to unregulated growth and proliferation that is typical of cancerous cells. These mutated protein kinases represent an attractive target for anticancer agents. The potent activity and lack of generalized toxicity of the kinase inhibitors relate to the specificity of antagonist for the mutated protein. In like manner, their toxicity often relates to off-target activity, either to the unmutated kinase or to closely related, normal kinases. The protein kinases can be categorized based upon the amino acid that they phosphorylate: either serine, threonine or . The  kinase receptor inhibitors were the initial and are perhaps the best characterized kinase inhibitors. The protein kinase inhibitors are relatively recently developed agents, all having been introduced since 2001. They are unique and represent a major advance in cancer chemotherapy, away from broadly cytotoxic agents and towards drugs that specifically target the molecular abnormalities of cancer cells. The initial  kinase inhibitor approved for use in the United States was imatinib (Gleevec: 2001) which is used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has a mutated kinase receptor (BCR-ABL) that is created by the specific translocation that creates the Philadelphia chromosome. Imatinib is a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase. The introduction of this first protein kinase inhibitor was followed by more than a dozen others within the next 10 years.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643292>Imatinib.</a></h1><p>Imatinib is specific  kinase receptor inhibitor that is used in the therapy of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, both of which are marked by an abnormal, constitutively expressed  kinase that causes unregulated cell growth.

Such data are important in order to contextualize the incidence of various cardiovascular outcomes among cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials of new agents and for postmarketing surveillance.A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) population of cancer patients. The inclusion criterion was a KPNC Cancer Registry diagnosis of any of several selected solid and hematologic tumors between 1997 and 2009 not treated with a TKI. Endpoints were identified using ICD-9 codes and included acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, stroke, cardiac arrest, hypertension, venous thromboembolism, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. Event rates were calculated according to type of cancer and number of cardiovascular risk factors.The study included almost 165 000 individuals with a broad variety of tumor types. The parent cohort was 54% female and 35% were ≥70 years old. Cardiovascular risk factors such as  (14% of patients with solid tumors, 15% of patients with liquid tumors), dyslipidemia (33%, 31%), hypertension (50%, 49%), and smoking (35%, 32%) were common. The most frequent adverse outcomes were incident hypertension (26.8-61.0 cases per 1000 person-years, depending on the type of cancer), heart failure (9.4-78.7), and acute coronary syndrome (2.6-48.1). These event rates are high compared to what has been reported in prior KPNC cohort studies of patients without cancer. The rates of acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and ischemic stroke increased with increasing numbers of cardiovascular risk factors.In a population of patients with cancer not exposed to TKIs, cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes are very common, regardless of cancer type. These data can inform the evaluation of potential excess cardiovascular risks from new interventions.© 2019 The Authors.

DM is characterized by the elevation of blood glucose due either to a defect in insulin synthesis, secretion, binding to receptor, or an increase of insulin resistance. The internal and external factors such as obesity, urbanizations, and genetic mutations could increase the risk of developing DM. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds existing as secondary metabolites in fruits and vegetables as well as fungi. Their structure consists of 15 carbon skeletons and two aromatic rings (A and B) connected by three carbon chains. Flavonoids are furtherly classified into 6 subclasses: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, flavanols, and anthocyanidins. Naturally occurring flavonoids possess anti-diabetic effects. As in vitro and animal model's studies demonstrate, they have the ability to prevent  and its complications.

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy metabolism and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and  632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and  632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298844>An Isoform-Selective PTP1B Inhibitor Derived from Nitrogen-Atom Augmentation of Radicicol.</a></h1><p>A library of natural products and their derivatives was screened for inhibition of protein  phosphatase (PTP) 1B, which is a validated drug target for the treatment of obesity and type II .

The influence of PPGLs on metabolism is ill described but may impact diagnosis and management. The objective of this study was to systematically and quantitatively study PPGL induced metabolic changes at a systems level.Targeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of plasma specimens in a clinically well characterized prospective cohort study.Analyses of metabolic profiles of plasma specimens from 56 prospectively enrolled and clinically well characterized patients (23 males, 33 females) with catecholamine-producing PPGL before and after surgery, as well as measurement of 24h-urinary catecholamine using LC-MS/MS.From 127 analyzed metabolites, 15 were identified with significant changes before and after surgery: 5 amino acids/biogenic amines (creatinine, histidine, ornithine, sarcosine, ) and 1 glycerophospholipid (PCaeC34:2) with increased concentrations and 6 glycerophospholipids (PCaaC38:1, PCaaC42:0, PCaeC40:2, PCaeC42:5, PCaeC44:5, PCaeC44:6), 2 sphingomyelins (SMC24:1, SMC26:1) and hexose with decreased levels after surgery. Patients with a noradrenergic tumor phenotype had more pronounced alterations compared to those with an adrenergic tumor phenotype. Weak, but significant correlations for 8 of these 15 metabolites with total urine catecholamine levels were identified.This first large prospective metabolomics analysis of PPGL patients demonstrates broad metabolic consequences of catecholamine excess. Robust impact on lipid and amino acid metabolism may contribute to increased morbidity of PPGL patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159736>Identification of selection signatures involved in performance traits in a paternal broiler line.</a></h1><p>Natural and artificial selection leads to changes in certain regions of the genome resulting in selection signatures that can reveal genes associated with the selected traits. Selection signatures may be identified using different methodologies, of which some are based on detecting contiguous sequences of homozygous identical-by-descent haplotypes, called runs of homozygosity (ROH), or estimating fixation index (F) of genomic windows that indicates genetic differentiation. This study aimed to identify selection signatures in a paternal broiler TT line at generations 7th and 16th of selection and to investigate the genes annotated in these regions as well as the biological pathways involved. For such purpose, ROH and F-based analysis were performed using whole genome sequence of twenty-eight chickens from two different generations.ROH analysis identified homozygous regions of short and moderate size. Analysis of ROH patterns revealed regions commonly shared among animals and changes in ROH abundance and size between the two generations. Results also suggest that whole genome sequencing (WGS) outperforms SNPchip data avoiding overestimation of ROH size and underestimation of ROH number; however, sequencing costs can limited the number of animals analyzed. F-based analysis revealed genetic differentiation in several genomic windows. Annotation of the consensus regions of ROH and F windows revealed new and previously identified genes associated with traits of economic interest, such as APOB, IGF1, IGFBP2, POMC, PPARG, and ZNF423. Over-representation analysis of the genes resulted in biological terms of skeletal muscle, matrilin proteins, adipose tissue, hyperglycemia, , Salmonella infections and .Identification of ROH and F-based analyses revealed selection signatures in TT line and genes that have important role in traits of economic interest. Changes in the genome of the chickens were observed between the 7th and 16th generations showing that ancient and recent selection in TT line may have acted over genomic regions affecting diseases and performance traits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306739>DYRK1A aggravates β cell dysfunction and apoptosis by promoting the phosphorylation and degradation of IRS2.</a></h1><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of dual-specificity -(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), which is one of the most important regulators of Alzheimer's disease development, in islet β cell dysfunction and apoptosis. We found significantly increased expression of DYRK1A in both the hippocampus and pancreatic islets of APP/PS1 transgenic mice than in wild-type littermates. Furthermore, we observed that the overexpression of DYRK1A greatly aggravated β cell apoptosis. Most importantly, we found that DYRK1A directly interacted with insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS2) and promoted IRS2 phosphorylation, leading to the proteasomal degradation of IRS2 and promotion of β cell dysfunction and apoptosis.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of metformin use in patients with  (DM) and lung cancer receiving epidermal growth factor receptor- kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy.  A nationwide, population-based cohort study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. From January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2012, a total of 373 metformin and 1260 non-metformin lung cancer cohorts with type 2 DM and EGFR-TKI treatment were studied.  Metformin use was significantly associated with a reduced risk of death (hazard ratio: 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.85,  < .001), as well as a significantly longer median progression-free survival (9.2 months, 95% CI: 8.6-11.7, vs 6.4 months, 95% CI: 5.9-7.2 months,  < .001) and median overall survival (33.4 months, 95% CI: 29.4-40.2, vs 25.4 months, 95% CI: 23.7-27.2 months,  < 0.001).

Treatment of breast cancer mainly depends on chemotherapy, due to the lack of specifically approved targeted therapies for TNBC. It is of paramount importance to find new therapeutic approaches, as resistance to chemotherapy frequently occurs. Herein, we present clinical studies published within the last five years, in order to reveal possible targeted therapies against TNBC. We aimed to discuss factors against TNBC, such as  kinase inhibitors, anti-androgens, poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) inhibitors, anti-angiogenic factors, immune checkpoints and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI). Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway seems to be a promising field for the development of new anti-TNBC targeted therapies.

In this study, 17 new 4-thiazolinone derivatives were designed and synthesized as novel PTP1B inhibitors, and ADMET prediction confirmed that these compounds were to be drug-like.  enzyme activity experiments were performed on these compounds, and it was found that a plurality of compounds had good inhibitory activity and high selectivity against PTP1B protein. Among them, compound 7p exhibited the best inhibitory activity with an IC of 0.92 μM. The binding mode of compound 7p and PTP1B protein was explored, revealing the reason for its high efficiency. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations for the PTP1B and PTP1B systems revealed the effects of compound 7p on PTP1B protein at the molecular level. In summary, the study reported for the first time that 4-thiazolinone derivatives as a novel PTP1B inhibitor had good inhibitory activity and selectivity for the treatment of T2DM, providing more options for the development of PTP1B inhibitors.

Current therapeutic approaches, either pancreatic lipase inhibitors or appetite suppressors, are generally of limited effectiveness. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige cells dissipate fatty acids as heat to maintain body temperature, termed non-shivering thermogenesis; the activity and mass of BAT and beige cells are negatively correlated with overweight and obesity. The existence of BAT and beige cells in human adults provides an effective weight reduction therapy, a process likely to be amenable to pharmacological intervention. Herein, we combed through the physiology of thermogenesis and the role of BAT and beige cells in combating with obesity. We summarized the thermogenic regulators identified in the past decades, targeting G protein-coupled receptors, transient receptor potential channels, nuclear receptors and miscellaneous pathways. Advances in clinical trials were also presented. The main purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge from the biological importance of thermogenesis in energy homeostasis to the representative thermogenic regulators for treating obesity. Thermogenic regulators might have a large potential for further investigations to be developed as lead compounds in fighting obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406173>Metabolomics reveals a link between homocysteine and lipid metabolism and leukocyte telomere length: the ENGAGE consortium.</a></h1><p>Telomere shortening has been associated with multiple age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, , and dementia. However, the biological mechanisms responsible for these associations remain largely unknown. In order to gain insight into the metabolic processes driving the association of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) with age-related diseases, we investigated the association between LTL and serum metabolite levels in 7,853 individuals from seven independent cohorts. LTL was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the levels of 131 serum metabolites were measured with mass spectrometry in biological samples from the same blood draw. With partial correlation analysis, we identified six metabolites that were significantly associated with LTL after adjustment for multiple testing: lysophosphatidylcholine acyl C17:0 (lysoPC a C17:0, p-value = 7.1 × 10), methionine (p-value = 9.2 × 10),  (p-value = 2.1 × 10), phosphatidylcholine diacyl C32:1 (PC aa C32:1, p-value = 2.4 × 10), hydroxypropionylcarnitine (C3-OH, p-value = 2.6 × 10), and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C38:4 (PC ae C38:4, p-value = 9.0 × 10). Pathway analysis showed that the three phosphatidylcholines and methionine are involved in homocysteine metabolism and we found supporting evidence for an association of lipid metabolism with LTL. In conclusion, we found longer LTL associated with higher levels of lysoPC a C17:0 and PC ae C38:4, and with lower levels of methionine, , PC aa C32:1, and C3-OH. These metabolites have been implicated in inflammation, oxidative stress, homocysteine metabolism, and in cardiovascular disease and , two major drivers of morbidity and mortality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491569>Design and evaluation of non-carboxylate 5-arylidene-2-thioxo-4-imidazolidinones as novel non-competitive inhibitors of protein  phosphatase 1B.</a></h1><p>Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) acts as a negative regulator of insulin and leptin signalling and is crucially involved in the development of type 2 , obesity, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Pursuing our efforts to identify PTP1B inhibitors endowed with drug-like properties, we designed and evaluated 3-aryl-5-arylidene-2-thioxo-4-imidazolidinones (7) as a novel class of non-carboxylate PTP1B inhibitors. In agreement with our design, kinetic studies demonstrated that selected compounds 7 act as reversible, non-competitive inhibitors of the target enzyme at low micromolar concentrations. Accordingly, molecular docking experiments suggested that these inhibitors can fit an allosteric site of PTP1B that we previously individuated. Moreover, cellular assays demonstrated that compound 7e acts as a potent insulin-sensitizing agent in human liver HepG2 cells. Taken together, our results showed that these non-competitive PTP1B inhibitors can be considered promising lead compounds aimed to enhance druggability of the target enzyme and identify novel antidiabetic drugs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

On the other hand several studies suggested that NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to maintenance of gastrointestinal immune homeostasis and that activation of NLRP3 is regulated by protein  phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22).  polymorphism was implicated in the risk for various autoimmune diseases including type 1  (T1D) but not for celiac disease (CD). The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of inflammasome related polymorphisms in subjects with either T1D or CD as well as in subjects affected by both diseases. We examined  rs2476601 (p.Arg620Trp),  rs35829419 (p.Gln705Lys), and  rs2043211 (p.Cys10Ter) in 66 subjects with coexisting T1D and CD, 65 subjects with T1D who did not develop CD, 67 subjects diagnosed only with CD and 127 healthy unrelated Slovenian individuals. All results were adjusted for clinical characteristic and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk.  rs2476601 allele was significantly more frequent among subjects with T1D (P = 0.001) and less frequent in subjects with CD (P = 0.039) when compared to controls. In patients with coexisting T1D and CD this variant was significantly less frequent compared to T1D group (P = 0.010). Protective effect on CD development in individuals with T1D was observed only within the low risk HLA group. On the other hand, we found no association of  rs35829419 and  rs2043211 with the development of T1D, CD or both diseases together. In conclusion  rs2476601polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of developing T1D in Slovenian population, while no associations of proinflammatory  and  polymorphisms with T1D and CD were observed. Interestingly, the same  variant protected from CD.

Previously, we have identified PTPN9 and DUSP9 as potential antidiabetic targets and a multi-targeting natural product thereof. In this study, knockdown of PTPN11 increased AMPK phosphorylation in differentiated C2C12 muscle cells by 3.8 fold, indicating that PTPN11 could be an antidiabetic target. Screening of a library of 658 natural products against PTPN9, DUSP9, or PTPN11 identified chebulinic acid (CA) as a strong allosteric inhibitor with a slow cooperative binding to PTPN9 (IC = 34 nM) and PTPN11 (IC = 37 nM), suggesting that it would be a potential antidiabetic candidate. Furthermore, CA stimulated glucose uptake and resulted in increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Taken together, we demonstrated that CA increased glucose uptake as a dual inhibitor of PTPN9 and PTPN11 through activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. These results strongly suggest that CA could be used as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of type 2 .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In most patients, DAs achieve tumor shrinkage and normoprolactinemia at well tolerated doses. However, primary or, less often, secondary resistance to DAs may be also encountered representing challenging clinical scenarios. This is particularly true for aggressive prolactinomas in which surgery and radiotherapy may not achieve tumor control. In these cases, alternative medical treatments have been considered but data on their efficacy should be interpreted within the constraints of publication bias and of lack of relevant clinical trials. The limited reports on somatostatin analogues have shown conflicting results, but cases with optimal outcomes have been documented. Data on estrogen modulators and metformin are scarce and their usefulness remains to be evaluated. In many aggressive lactotroph tumors, temozolomide has demonstrated optimal outcomes, whereas for other cytotoxic agents,  kinase inhibitors and for inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), higher quality evidence is needed.

Secondary, to stratify associations by sex and puberty.Participants were from COBRA (Childhood Overweight BioRepository of Australia; a paediatric cohort with obesity). Adiposity measures (BMI, BMI z-score, %truncal and %whole body fat, waist circumference and waist/height ratio), puberty staging and NMR metabolomic profiles from serum were assessed.

With an eye toward eventual use in precision medicine therapeutic approaches in autoimmunity, we explored the ability of p110δ inhibition to compensate for PI3K pathway dysregulation in mouse models of autoimmunity. Low dosages of the p110δ inhibitor idelalisib, which spare the ability to mount an immune response to exogenous immunogens, are able to block the development of autoimmunity driven by compromised PI3K pathway regulation resultant from acutely induced B cell-targeted haploinsufficiency of PTEN and SHIP-1. These conditions do not block autoimmunity driven by B cell loss of the regulatory  phosphatase SHP-1. Finally, we show that B cells in NOD mice express reduced PTEN, and low-dosage p110δ inhibitor therapy blocks disease progression in this model of type 1 .

However, the metabolomic signature of T2DM in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has not been investigated thus far. In this prospective metabolomic study, fasting CSF and plasma samples from 40 T2DM patients to 36 control subjects undergoing elective surgery with spinal anesthesia were analyzed by H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR spectra of CSF and plasma metabolites were analyzed and correlated with the presence of T2DM and diabetic microangiopathy (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) using an area under the curve (AUC) estimation. CSF metabolomic profiles in T2DM patients vs. controls revealed significantly increased levels of alanine, leucine, valine, , lactate, pyruvate, and decreased levels of histidine. In addition, a combination of alanine, histidine, leucine, pyruvate, , and valine in CSF showed a superior correlation with the presence of T2DM (AUC:0.951), diabetic retinopathy (AUC:0.858), nephropathy (AUC:0.811), and neuropathy (AUC:0.691). Similar correlations also appeared in plasma profiling. These metabolic alterations in CSF suggest decreasing aerobic metabolism and increasing anaerobic glycolysis in cerebral circulation of patients with T2DM. In conclusion, our results provide clues for the metabolic derangements in diabetic central neuropathy among T2DM patients; however, their clinical significance requires further exploration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004367>Low-dose aspirin reduces hypoxia-induced sFlt1 release via the JNK/AP-1 pathway in human trophoblast and endothelial cells.</a></h1><p>Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a serious hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that remains a leading cause of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Placental ischemia/hypoxia and the secretion of soluble fms-like  kinase 1 (sFlt1) into maternal circulation are involved in the pathogenesis of PE. Although low-dose aspirin (LDA) has beneficial effects on the prevention of PE, the exact mechanisms of action of LDA, particularly on placental dysfunction, and sFlt1 release, have not been well investigated. This study aimed to determine whether LDA exists the protective effects on placental trophoblast and endothelial functions and prevents PE-associated sFlt1 release. First, we observed that LDA mitigated hypoxia-induced trophoblast apoptosis, showed positive effects on trophoblast cells migration and invasion activity, and increased the tube-forming activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In addition, LDA decreased hypoxia-induced sFlt1 production, and the c-Jun NH -terminal kinase/activator protein-1 (JNK/AP-1) pathway was shown to mediate the induction of sFlt1. Moreover, the transcription factor AP-1 was confirmed to regulate the Flt1 gene expression by directly binding to the Flt1 promoter in luciferase assays. The result of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated that LDA could directly decrease the expression of the transcription factor AP-1, and thus decrease sFlt1 production. Finally, the effects of LDA on sFlt1 production were proved in human placental explants. Taken together, our data show the protective effects of LDA against trophoblast and endothelial cell dysfunction and reveal that the LDA-mediated inhibition of sFlt1 via the JNK/AP-1 pathway may be a potential cellular/molecular mechanism for the prevention of PE.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644524>Effect and Mechanism of the Bruton  Kinase (Btk) Inhibitor Ibrutinib on Rat Model of Diabetic Foot Ulcers.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND  causes damage to the soft tissue and bone structure of the foot, referred to as "diabetic foot". Ibrutinib is a Bruton  kinase (Btk) inhibitor, and the role and mechanism of ibrutinib on the diabetic foot have not been elucidated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Male Wister rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: control group, model group, and ibrutinib group. After 14 days, the ulcer wound size of each group was measured, and the ulcer healing rate was calculated. The level of inflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-1ß, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-6 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyze the changes of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end product/NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappa B) pathway was detected by western blot. RESULTS Blood glucose, blood lipids, serum creatinine, and urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were increased in the model group, together with increased levels of IL-1ß, TNF-alpha, IL-6, as well as TLR2 and TLR4 expression, and there were significant differences compared with the control group (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the model group showed decreased VEGF expression and increased expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB. However, ibrutinib reduced blood sugar, blood lipids, creatinine, and urea nitrogen levels, inhibited the secretion of inflammatory factors, promoted ulcer healing, improved ulcer healing rate, decreased the expression of TLR2, TLR4, RAGE, and NF-kappaB, and increased VEGF expression; there were significant differences in the ibrutinib group compared with the model group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The Btk inhibitor ibrutinib can upregulate VEGF expression, inhibit the expression of TLRs, inhibit the secretion of inflammatory factors, and promote the healing of diabetic foot ulcer possibly by regulating the RAGE/NF-kappaB pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644242>Neratinib.</a></h1><p>Neratinib is an orally available  kinase receptor inhibitor that is used in the extended adjuvant therapy of early stage breast cancer.

The key role of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) in inflammatory responses has focused this study in understanding its implication in liver fibrosis. Here we show that hepatic PTP1B mRNA expression increased after bile duct ligation (BDL), while BDL-induced liver fibrosis was markedly reduced in mice lacking Ptpn1 (PTP1B) as assessed by decreased collagen deposition and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression. PTP1B mice also showed a significant increase in mRNA levels of key markers of monocytes recruitment (Cd68, Adgre1 and Ccl2) compared to their wild-type (PTP1B) littermates at early stages of injury after BDL. Interestingly, the lack of PTP1B strongly increased the NADPH oxidase (NOX) subunits Nox1/Nox4 ratio and downregulated Cybb expression after BDL, revealing a pro-survival pattern of NADPH oxidase induction in response to liver injury. Chimeric mice generated by transplantation of PTP1B bone marrow (BM) into irradiated PTP1B mice revealed similar hepatic expression profile of NOX subunits than PTP1B mice while these animals did not show differences in infiltration of myeloid cells at 7 days post-BDL, suggesting that PTP1B deletion in other liver cells is necessary for boosting the early inflammatory response to the BDL. PTP1B BM transplantation into PTP1B mice also led to a blockade of TGF-β and α-SMA induction after BDL. In vitro experiments demonstrated that deficiency of PTP1B in hepatocytes protects against bile acid-induced apoptosis and abrogates hepatic stellate cells (HSC) activation, an effect ameliorated by NOX1 inhibition. In conclusion, our results have revealed that the lack of PTP1B switches NOX expression pattern in response to liver injury after BDL and reduces HSC activation and liver fibrosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Several studies identified protein  phosphatase (PTP)-1B, a member of the PTP superfamily, as a major negative regulator for insulin receptor signaling and a novel molecular player in endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. Unlike other anti-diabetic approaches, genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PTP1B was found to improve glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling without causing lipid buildup in the liver, which represents an advantage over existing therapies. Furthermore, PTP1B was reported to contribute to cardiovascular disturbances, at various molecular levels, which places this enzyme as a unique single therapeutic target for both  and cardiovascular disorders. Synthesizing selective small molecule inhibitors for PTP1B is faced with multiple challenges linked to its similarity of sequence with other PTPs; however, overcoming these challenges would pave the way for novel approaches to treat  and its concurrent cardiovascular complications. In this review article, we summarized the major roles of PTP1B in cardiovascular disease with special emphasis on endothelial dysfunction and its interplay with insulin resistance. Furthermore, we discussed some of the major challenges hindering the synthesis of selective inhibitors for PTP1B.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30931927>Mitotic regulators and the SHP2-MAPK pathway promote IR endocytosis and feedback regulation of insulin signaling.</a></h1><p>Insulin controls glucose homeostasis and cell growth through bifurcated signaling pathways. Dysregulation of insulin signaling is linked to  and cancer. The spindle checkpoint controls the fidelity of chromosome segregation during mitosis. Here, we show that insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS1/2) cooperate with spindle checkpoint proteins to promote insulin receptor (IR) endocytosis through recruiting the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 to IR. A phosphorylation switch of IRS1/2 orchestrated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and Src homology phosphatase 2 (SHP2) ensures selective internalization of activated IR. SHP2 inhibition blocks this feedback regulation and growth-promoting IR signaling, prolongs insulin action on metabolism, and improves insulin sensitivity in mice. We propose that mitotic regulators and SHP2 promote feedback inhibition of IR, thereby limiting the duration of insulin signaling. Targeting this feedback inhibition can improve insulin sensitivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643465>Nintedanib.</a></h1><p>Nintedanib is an orally available  kinase receptor antagonist that inhibits collagen formation and is used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

One of these peptides is islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which is responsible for amyloid formation in type 2 . The mechanism of IAPP amyloid formation in vivo and in vitro is not well understood and the factors behind the peptide aggregates toxicity are not fully defined. Therefore, the precise nature of toxic agents still remains to be elucidated. In this context, first we used a complementary biophysical approach to undertake a systematic study of the hIAPP aggregation process with focus on the lag phase, followed by the study of their degrees of toxicity when added to the extracellular medium of pancreatic cells. The structural properties of hIAPP aggregates are characterized by evaluating their size with DLS, their surface hydrophobicity with ANS, and the interactions between monomers through the intrinsic fluorescence of aromatic residues or by the quenching of these residues mainly the  in position 37. Our results indicate that despite the method used to study hIAPP aggregation, the obtained curve is easily well fitted in a sigmoidal curve but with some differences. In fact, the analysis of the kinetic parameters gives different information about the hIAPP aggregation process such as lag time and growth rate. Moreover, a high surface hydrophobicity and small size of the aggregates, mainly for the species formed during the lag time, shows strong correlation with the cytotoxicity. These findings provide new insights into the structural changes during hIAPP aggregation and are consistent with a model in which the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces and the small size of aggregates formed during the early stage of the process are crucial for their cytotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Previously, arylbenzofurans were reported to have inhibitory activity against PTP1B. However, detailed investigation regarding their structure activity relationship (SAR) has not been elucidated. The main aim of this work was to investigate the PTP1B inhibitory activity of 2-arylbenzofuran analogs (sanggenofuran A (SA), mulberrofuran D2 (MD2), mulberrofuran D (MD), morusalfuran B (MB), mulberrofuran H (MH)) isolated from the root bark of  All compounds demonstrated potent inhibitory activity with IC values ranging from 3.11 to 53.47 µM. Among the tested compounds, MD2 showed the strongest activity (IC, 3.11 µM), followed by MD and MB, while SA and MH demonstrated the lowest activity. Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots were used for the determination of inhibition type whereas ligand and receptor interactions were investigated in modeled complexes via molecular docking. Our study clearly supports 2-arylbenzofuran analogs as a promising class of PTP1B inhibitors and illustrates the key positions responsible for the inhibitory activity, their correlation, the effect of prenyl/geranyl groups, and the influence of resorcinol scaffold, which can be further explored in-depth to develop therapeutic agents against T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539748>Discovery of 2-ethoxy-4-(methoxymethyl)benzamide derivatives as potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a key negative regulator of insulin signaling, is considered as a promising and validated therapeutic target for type 2  (T2DM) and obesity.

This study aims to examine the association between dietary AAs and prospective changes in serum lipid profile in adults.Analyses were conducted on 3881 participants aged, 18-75 years of Tehran lipid and Glucose study, at baseline (2008-2011) and were followed for 3 years (2011-2014) to ascertain serum lipid profile changes. Dietary intakes of AAs were collected at baseline using food frequency questionnaire. Multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, physical activity, smoking and daily intakes of energy, total fat, and fiber were used.The median(IQR) changes in triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were 6.0(-19.0, -35.5), 9.0(7.0, -24.0), 1.0(-3.0, -6.0), and 5.2(-8.0, -18.6) mg/dl, respectively. Higher intakes of isoleucine, lysine, , alanine, threonine, methionine, valine, histidine, aspartic acid, and branched chain, alkaline, and alcoholic AAs were positively associated with TGs-changes in the final adjusted model, whereas tryptophan, glutamic acid, and acidic AAs were negatively related to TG-changes. Alanine and tryptophan were associated with higher and lower LDL-C-changes, respectively. Lysine, alanine, methionine, aspartic acid, and alkaline AAs showed positive association with changes in TC, whereas tryptophan and glutamic acid had a negative association with TC-changes.Our findings showed that some dietary amino acids have the potential to increase or decrease serum lipid profile.Copyright © 2019  India.

In the past decade, single nucleotide polymorphisms in several genes have been identified as risk factors for development of gestational hypertension. The epidermal growth factor receptor activates  kinase mediated blood vessels contractility; and inflammatory cascades. Abnormalities in these mechanism are known to contribute towards hypertension. It is thus plausible that polymorphisms in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene would be associated with the development of hypertension in women with gestational .To determine whether the epidermal growth factor receptor rs17337023 SNP is associated with the occurrence of hypertension in gestational diabetic women.This pilot case-control study was conducted at two tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, from January 2017-August 2018. Two hundred and two women at 28 week of gestation with gestational  were recruited and classified into normotensive ( = 80) and hypertensive ( = 122) groups. Their blood samples were genotyped for epidermal growth factor receptor polymorphism rs17337023 using tetra-ARMS polymerase chain reaction. Descriptive analysis was applied on baseline data. Polymorphism data was analyzed for genotype and allele frequency determination using chi-squared statistics. In all cases, a  value of < 0.05 was considered significant.Subjects were age-matched and thus no difference was observed in relation to age of the study subjects ( >0.05). Body fat percentage was significantly higher in hypertensive females as compared to normotensive subjects (35.138 ± 4.29 Case  25.01 ± 8.28 Control;  < 0.05). Similarly, systolic and diastolic blood pressures among groups were significantly higher in hypertensive group than the normotensive group ( < 0.05). Overall epidermal growth factor receptor rs17337023 polymorphism genotype frequency was similar in both groups, with the heterozygous AT genotype (56 in Case  48 in Control;  = 0. 079) showing predominance in both groups. Furthermore, the odds ratio for A allele was 1.282 ( = 0.219) and for T allele was 0.780 ( = 0.221) in this study.This pilot study indicates that polymorphisms in rs17337023 may not be involved in the pathophysiology of gestational hypertension in gestational   inflammatory cascade mechanism.

This study aimed to identify the substrate of PTPN2 in mediating beneficial effects of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)2D ) on diabetic periodontitis. 25(OH)2D photo-affinity probe was synthesized with the minimalist linker and its efficacy to inhibit alveolar bone loss, and inflammation was evaluated in diabetic periodontitis mice. The probe was used to pull down the lysates of primary gingival fibroblasts. We identified PTPN2 as a direct target of 25(OH)2D , which effectively inhibited inflammation and bone resorption in diabetic periodontitis mice. In addition, we found that colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) rather than JAK/STAT was the substrate of PTPN2 to regulate bone resorption. PTPN2 direct interacted with CSF1R and dephosphorylated Tyr807 residue. In conclusion, PTPN2 dephosphorylates CSF1R at Y807 site and inhibits alveolar bone resorption in diabetic periodontitis mice. PTPN2 and CSF1R are potential targets for the therapy of diabetic periodontitis or other bone loss-related diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

This study was undertaken to determine the aetiology of  in young Indian adults using a protocol-based set of simple clinical and investigation tools.In this prospective study, 105 Indian young adults with  (age at onset 18-35 yr; duration <2 yr) were studied for a period of 1-3 years. Pancreatic imaging, fasting C-peptide, islet antibodies (against glutamic acid decarboxylase,  phosphatase and zinc transporter-8) and mitochondrial A3243G mutational analysis were performed in all patients. Four patients were screened for maturity-onset  of the young (MODY) using next-generation sequencing.Type 1 and type 2  (T1DM and T2DM) were equally frequent (40% each), followed by fibrocalculous pancreatic  (FCPD, 15%). Less common aetiologies included MODY (2%), mitochondrial  (1%) and Flatbush  (2%). There was considerable phenotypic overlap between the main aetiological subtypes.

From postoperative weeks 4 to 6, acute feeding studies were performed in which the selective GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin-9 (30 μg/kg), the second-generation selective Y2 receptor antagonist JNJ-31020028 (10 mg/kg), or a combination of both drugs was administered intraperitoneally.During the observational period weight, adiposity and total food intake were lower while postprandial plasma GLP-1 and peptide   levels were higher for RYGB-operated compared with sham-operated rats. There was a gradual shift in preference from HF to low-fat food in RYGB-operated rats by postoperative week 3. Single antagonist treatments had a relatively modest impact on HF food preference in rats from both surgical groups. However, dual antagonist treatment caused a striking increase in HF food preference specifically in RYGB-operated rats.GLP-1 and peptide   3-36 reduce HF food preference additively after RYGB supporting the use of gut hormone combination strategies for healthier feeding behavior.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

Paeonilactiflorol (1) was determined by extensive HRESIMS, UV, IR, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses. Most of the stilbenes showed obvious inhibition on PTP1B and α-glucosidase, superior to the monoterpene glycosides. Especially, the stilbene tetramer (1) and trimer (8) exhibited high activity inhibiting both PTP1B with IC values of 27.23 and 27.81 μM and α-glucosidase with IC values of 13.57 and 14.39 μM. Two trans-dimers (4 and 5) also showed dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPPIV) inhibitory activity (55.35% and 61.26%, 500 μM) in addition to PTP1B and α-glucosidase.

More than 35% of these individuals exhibit no to mild diabetic retinopathy (DR), independent of glycemic control, suggesting the presence of endogenous protective factors against DR in a subpopulation of patients. Proteomic analysis of retina and vitreous identified retinol binding protein 3 (RBP3), a retinol transport protein secreted mainly by the photoreceptors, as elevated in Medalist patients protected from advanced DR. Mass spectrometry and protein expression analysis identified an inverse association between vitreous RBP3 concentration and DR severity. Intravitreal injection and photoreceptor-specific overexpression of RBP3 in rodents inhibited the detrimental effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Mechanistically, our results showed that recombinant RBP3 exerted the therapeutic effects by binding and inhibiting VEGF receptor  phosphorylation. In addition, by binding to glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and decreasing glucose uptake, RBP3 blocked the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia in inducing inflammatory cytokines in retinal endothelial and Müller cells. Elevated expression of photoreceptor-secreted RBP3 may have a role in protection against the progression of DR due to hyperglycemia by inhibiting glucose uptake via GLUT1 and decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines and VEGF.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Recent studies suggested that protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) could ameliorate metabolic disorders and suppress inflammatory responses. This study investigated PTPN2's role in modulating DN and the possible cellular mechanisms involved. In a mouse model combining hyperglycaemia and hypercholesterolaemia (streptozotocin diabetic, ApoE mice), mice showed severe insulin resistance, renal dysfunction, micro-inflammation, subsequent extracellular matrix expansion and decreased expression of PTPN2. We found that mice treated with PTPN2 displayed reduced serum creatinine, serum BUN and proteinuria. PTPN2 gene therapy markedly attenuated metabolic disorders and hyperglycaemia. In addition, PTPN2 gene transfer significantly suppressed renal activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), STAT-dependent pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes expression, and influx of lymphocytes in DN, indicating anti-inflammatory effects of PTPN2 by inhibiting the activation of STAT signalling pathway in vivo. Furthermore, PTPN2 overexpression inhibited the high-glucose induced phosphorylation of STAT, target genes expression and proliferation in mouse mesangial and tubuloepithelial cells, suggesting that the roles of PTPN2 on STAT activation was independent of glycaemic changes. Our results demonstrated that PTPN2 gene therapy could exert protective effects on DN via ameliorating metabolic disorders and inhibiting renal STAT-dependent micro-inflammation, suggesting its potential role for treatment of human DN.© 2019 The Authors.

This study investigated the systemic effect of third molars on serum levels of inflammatory parameters and on inflammatory messenger peptide hormones in a general population sample.Data of 2,151 participants from the Study of Health in Pomerania were included in this study. Erupted or impacted third molars were assessed with whole-body magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 T and associated with biomarkers of inflammation, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, and peptide hormones by linear regression. Models were adjusted for age, gender, smoking status, education, and type 2 .Neither erupted nor impacted third molars were associated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, or fibrinogen as markers for systemic inflammation. Participants with erupted third molars had markedly lower serum levels of leptin (β coefficient, -2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.47 to -0.48), angiopoietin-2 (β coefficient, -135.1; 95% CI, 248.6 to -21.5), and ratio of angiopoietin-2 to  kinase with immunoglobulin-like loop epidermal growth factor homology domain 2 (β coefficient, -6.57; 95% CI, -13.06 to -00.7) than participants without third molars. No such associations were observed for impacted third molars.The present results did not substantiate a relation between third molars and an increase in systemic inflammatory markers. Therefore, dental practitioners should be careful when considering this as the only indication for removal of third molars, especially in medically compromised patients. The results of this study showed that participants with erupted third molars had lower levels of messenger peptide hormones, such as leptin and angiopoetin-2.Copyright © 2019 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

However, no information exists on the state of bone marrow sensory innervation in type 1 . Sensory neurons are trophically dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF) for their survival. The aim of this investigation was twofold: (1) to determine if sensory neuropathy affects the bone marrow in a mouse model of type 1 , with consequences for stem cell liberation after tissue injury; and (2) to verify if a single systemic injection of the NGF gene exerts long-term beneficial effects on these phenomena.A mouse model of type 1  was generated in CD1 mice by administration of streptozotocin; vehicle was administered to non-diabetic control animals. Diabetic animals were randomised to receive systemic gene therapy with either human NGF or β-galactosidase. After 13 weeks, limb ischaemia was induced in both groups to study the recovery post injury. When the animals were killed, samples of tissue and peripheral blood were taken to assess stem cell mobilisation and homing, levels of substance P and muscle vascularisation. An in vitro cellular model was adopted to verify signalling downstream to human NGF and related neurotrophic or pro-apoptotic effects. Normally distributed variables were compared between groups using the unpaired Student's t test and non-normally distributed variables were assessed by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The Fisher's exact test was employed for categorical variables.Immunohistochemistry indicated a 3.3-fold reduction in the number of substance P-positive nociceptive fibres in the bone marrow of type 1 diabetic mice (p < 0.001 vs non-diabetic). Moreover,  abrogated the creation of a neurokinin gradient which, in non-diabetic mice, favoured the mobilisation and homing of bone-marrow-derived stem cells expressing the substance P receptor neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R). Pre-emptive gene therapy with NGF prevented bone marrow denervation, contrasting with the inhibitory effect of  on the mobilisation of NK1R-expressing stem cells, and restored blood flow recovery from limb ischaemia. In vitro hNGF induced neurite outgrowth and exerted anti-apoptotic actions on rat PC12 cells exposed to high glucose via activation of the canonical neurotrophic  kinase receptor type 1 (TrkA) signalling pathway.This study shows, for the first time, the occurrence of sensory neuropathy in the bone marrow of type 1 diabetic mice, which translates into an altered modulation of substance P and depressed release of substance P-responsive stem cells following ischaemia. NGF therapy improves bone marrow sensory innervation, with benefits for healing on the occurrence of peripheral ischaemia.

However, the comparisons of potential markers in spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis in DM males have never been elucidated.This study aimed to examine the expressions of -phosphorylated and steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) proteins in testis of DM mice.Fifty-six male C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups (n░=░14/ each): control of MLD-STZ (multiple low doses of streptozotocin), MLD-STZ, control of HFD-STZ (high-fat diet with STZ), and HFD-STZ. MLD-STZ mice (type 1 DM) were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with STZ at 40░mg/kg BW for five days. HFD-STZ mice (type 2 DM) received an HFD for 14 days and i.p.-induced by STZ at 85░mg/kg BW and fed with HFD. At the end of the experiment (days 36 and 72), the expressions of phosphorylated proteins and StAR were examined. phosphorylated proteins were localized in late spermatids, luminal fluid, and Leydig cells. The intensities of phosphorylated 110, 85, 72, 60, and 55░kDas were lower in the 36 day-DM mice. Although such intensities were present in both groups, only 85░kDa in the MLD-STZ mice was higher in HFD mice at 72 days. StAR expressions in both groups were decreased than that of the controls.Decreased expressions of StAR and -phosphorylated proteins may be directly involved in low testosterone levels and impaired spermatogenesis. These findings support the notion that both DM types play a role in male infertility.Copyright © 2019 Apichakan Sampannang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31071507>An integrative investigation on the efficacy of Plantaginis semen based on UPLC-QTOF-MS metabolomics approach in hyperlipidemic mice.</a></h1><p>Plantaginis semen, the dried mature seed of Plantago asiatica L. or Plantago deprdssa Willd., has a prominent effect on the treatment of obesity, type 2  and lipid disorders, however, its clinical application is limited due to inadequate in-depth mechanism exploration and incomplete discussion of action targets of its in vivo. Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was firstly applied to study the serum metabolic differences in mice. Metabolomics analysis was performed using ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) together with multivariate statistical data analysis. The results showed that Plantaginis semen can mainly improve blood lipids, some degree in blood glucose and insulin levels in high-fat mice, in addition, the phenotype of liver and fat stained sections demonstrated remarkable results. A total of 22 metabolites involved in arachidonic acid, glycerophospholipid, glycosphingolipid, linoleate, Omega-3 fatty acid, phosphatidylinositol phosphate and  metabolisms were identified. In further, it was found that the possible mechanisms of Plantaginis semen on hyperlipidemic mice lied in the biosynthesis of thyroxine, biological effects of enzymes of phospholipase A2 activity, glucosylceramide synthase and inositol essential enzyme 1α, genes expressions of fatty acid metabolism and inflammation. Serum metabolomics revealed that Plantaginis semen could cure the organism disease via regulating multiple metabolic pathways which will be helpful for understanding the mechanism of this herb and providing references for better applications of it in clinic, even researches on other TCMs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The kinase activity of TrkA is essential for its interaction with the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and activation of Akt and Erk5 in PC12 cells. Here we show in brain from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic rats that the expression of the inactive proNGF is elevated, whereas the expression of mature NGF is reduced. In addition,  phosphorylation of TrkA is decreased in STZ-induced  compared to control. Results of the co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the interaction of TrkA with the IR and IRS-1 is also reduced in the brain of diabetic rats. Moreover,  phosphorylation of the IR and IRS-1, and Akt activation is decreased in STZ  compared to control. Our results suggest that the NGF-TrkA receptor is involved in insulin signaling and is impaired in the brain of STZ-induced diabetic rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Activation of Tie-2 receptor via Ang-1 maintains vascular stability to limit exudation. Ang-2, a competitive antagonist to Ang-1, and VE-PTP, an endothelial-specific phosphatase, interfere with the Tie-2-Ang-1 axis, resulting in vascular leakage. : Faricimab, a bispecific antibody that inhibits VEGF-A and Ang-2, is in phase 3 trials for nAMD and DME.

These effects are linked to the activation of neuropeptide Y1 receptors (NPYR1s) by PYY(1-36). However, PYY(1-36) is subject to rapid degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), resulting is the loss of NPYR1 activity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop 2 enzymatically stable PYY(1-36) analogues, namely, (PLP)PYY(1-36) and PYY(1-36)(LysPAL), with further structural modifications to enhance NPYR1 specificity. As expected, (PLP)PYY(1-36) was fully resistant to DPP-4-mediated degradation in vitro, whereas PYY(1-36) and PYY(1-36)(LysPAL) were both liable to DPP-4 breakdown. PYY(1-36) and (PLP)PYY(1-36) induced significant reductions in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from BRIN BD11 cells, but only PYY(1-36) diminished alanine-stimulated insulin secretion. In contrast, PYY(1-36)(LysPAL) had no impact on GSIS or alanine-induced insulin release. All 3 PYY peptides significantly enhanced proliferation in BRIN BD11 and 1.1B4 beta-cell lines, albeit only at the highest concentration examined, 10 M, for (PLP)PYY(1-36) and PYY(1-36)(LysPAL) in BRIN BD11 cells. Regarding the protection of beta-cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis, PYY(1-36) induced clear protective effects. Both (PLP)PYY(1-36) and PYY(1-36)(LysPAL) offered some protection against apoptosis in BRIN BD11 cells, but were significantly less efficacious than PYY(1-36). Similarly, in 1.1B4 cells, both PYY analogues (10 M) protected against cytokine-induced apoptosis, but (PLP)PYY(1-36) was significantly less effective than PYY(1-36). All 3 PYY peptides had no impact on refeeding in overnight fasted mice. These data underline the beta-cell benefits of PYY(1-36) and highlight the challenges of synthesising stable, bioactive, NPYR1-specific, PYY(1-36) analogues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243247>[A case of recurrent cerebral infarction during treatment with oral  kinase inhibitors for chronic myelogenous leukemia].</a></h1><p>A 76-year-old man, diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in 2010, had been on nilotinib for 7 years. He presented with right hemiparesis in September 2017. He had no history of hypertension, , hyperlipidemia, heart disease, or smoking. Brain MRI revealed a border-zone infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere and a rapidly progressing severe left internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. He was initiated on clopidogrel and bosutinib instead of nilotinib. He presented with right hemiparesis once again in December 2017. Brain MRI revealed the border-zone infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere and a more progressed, severe bilateral ICA stenosis. A carotid ultrasound demonstrated iso-intense and concentrically narrowed ICA on both sides. Carotid artery stenting of the left ICA was performed in February 2018, and clopidogrel was replaced by cilostazol to provide a drug-induced rush. Carotid artery stenting of the right ICA was performed in June 2018 and cervical angiogram demonstrated that there were no residual artery stenoses in the bilateral stent.

Fenofibrate, a regulator of sphingolipid metabolism, is known to prevent  in NOD mice. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of fenofibrate on the pancreatic lipidome, pancreas morphology, pancreatic sympathetic nerves and blood glucose homeostasis in NOD mice.We treated female NOD mice with fenofibrate from 3 weeks of age. The pancreatic lipidome was analysed using MS. Analysis of pancreas and islet volume was performed by stereology. Islet sympathetic nerve fibre volume was evaluated using  hydroxylase staining. The effect on blood glucose homeostasis was assessed by measuring non-fasting blood glucose from age 12 to 30 weeks. Furthermore, we measured glucose tolerance, fasting insulin and glucagon levels, and insulin tolerance.We found that fenofibrate selectively increases the amount of very-long-chain sphingolipids in the pancreas of NOD mice. In addition, we found that fenofibrate causes a remodelling of the pancreatic lipidome with an increased amount of lysoglycerophospholipids. Fenofibrate did not affect islet or pancreas volume, but led to a higher volume of islet sympathetic nerve fibres and  hydroxylase-positive cells. Fenofibrate-treated NOD mice had a more stable blood glucose, which was associated with reduced non-fasting and increased fasting blood glucose. Furthermore, fenofibrate improved glucose tolerance, reduced fasting glucagon levels and prevented fasting hyperinsulinaemia.These data indicate that fenofibrate alters the pancreatic lipidome to a more anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic state. The beneficial effects on islet sympathetic nerve fibres and blood glucose homeostasis indicate that fenofibrate could be used as a therapeutic approach to improve blood glucose homeostasis and prevent -associated pathologies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643304>Lapatinib.</a></h1><p>Lapatinib is a small molecule inhibitor of several  kinase receptors involved in tumor cell growth that is used in the therapy of advanced breast cancer and other solid tumors.

Here, we show that expression of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a HIF-1-regulated gene product, is increased in the eyes of diabetic mice and patients with DME. We observed that ANGPTL4 and VEGF act synergistically to destabilize the retinal vascular barrier. Interestingly, while ANGPTL4 modestly enhanced  phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2, promotion of vascular permeability by ANGPTL4 was independent of this receptor. Instead, we found that ANGPTL4 binds directly to neuropilin 1 (NRP1) and NRP2 on endothelial cells (ECs), leading to rapid activation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway and breakdown of EC-EC junctions. Treatment with a soluble fragment of NRP1 (sNRP1) prevented ANGPTL4 from binding to NRP1 and blocked ANGPTL4-induced activation of RhoA as well as EC permeability in vitro and retinal vascular leakage in diabetic animals in vivo. In addition, sNRP1 reduced the stimulation of EC permeability by aqueous fluid from patients with DME. Collectively, these data identify the ANGPTL4/NRP/RhoA pathway as a therapeutic target for the treatment of DME.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410531>Adenine nucleotide-mediated regulation of hepatic PTP1B activity in mouse models of type 2 .</a></h1><p>Plasma 5'-AMP (pAMP) is elevated in mouse models of type 2 . However, the metabolic regulatory role of adenine nucleotides in type 2  remains unclear.Adenine nucleotides and their metabolites in plasma and liver were examined by HPLC. H NMR-based metabolomics analysis was performed to explore the changes of metabolites in mouse models of type 2 . Na/K ATPase and Na/H exchanger activity were measured in response to adenine nucleotide metabolites. Human recombinant protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was used for enzyme kinetic assays. Protein binding assays were performed with microscale thermophoresis. The intracellular pH of hepatocyte AML12 cell lines was measured using the BCECF-AM method. We also analysed pAMP levels in participants with type 2 .Elevation of pAMP was a universal phenomenon in all mouse models of type 2  including db/db vs lean mice (13.9 ± 2.3 μmol/l vs 3.7 ± 0.9 μmol/l; p < 0.01), ob/ob vs lean mice (9.1 ± 2.0 μmol/l vs 3.9 ± 1.2 μmol/l; p < 0.01) and high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced vs wild-type mice (6.6 ± 1.5 μmol/l vs 4.1 ± 0.9 μmol/l; p < 0.05); this elevation was required for the occurrence of hyperglycaemia in obese mice. H NMR-based metabolomics study following HPLC analysis revealed that the metabolite profile in wild-type mice treated with 5'-AMP was similar to that in db/db diabetic mice, especially the accumulation of a large quantity of ATP and its metabolites. The glucose-lowering drug metformin reduced the severity of hyperglycaemia both in 5'-AMP-induced wild-type mice and db/db mice. Metformin decreased the accumulation of liver ATP but not its metabolites in these hyperglycaemic mice. ATP and metformin reciprocally change cellular pH homeostasis in liver, causing opposite shifts in liver activity of PTP1B, a key negative regulator of insulin signalling. Furthermore, pAMP levels were also elevated in individuals with type 2  (45.2 ± 22.7 nmol/l vs 3.1 ± 1.9 nmol/l; p < 0.01).These results reveal an emerging role for adenine nucleotide in the regulation of hyperglycaemia and provide a potential therapeutic target in obesity and type 2 .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413010>Combination of Metformin and Gefitinib as First-Line Therapy for Nondiabetic Advanced NSCLC Patients with EGFR Mutations: A Randomized, Double-Blind Phase II Trial.</a></h1><p>Preclinical and retrospective studies suggested a role for metformin in sensitizing patients who have  with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We therefore examined its effects in combination with gefitinib in patients without  harboring EGFR mutations (EGFRm).A total of 224 patients without  with treatment-naïve stage IIIB-IV EGFRm NSCLC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive gefitinib plus either metformin or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 1 year and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), PFS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Serum levels of IL6 were also examined in an exploratory analysis.The median duration of follow-up was 19.15 months. The estimated 1-year PFS rates were 41.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 30.0-52.2] with gefitinib plus metformin and 42.9% (95% CI, 32.6-52.7) with gefitinib plus placebo ( = 0.6268). Median PFS (10.3 months vs. 11.4 months) and median OS (22.0 months vs. 27.5 months) were numerically lower in the metformin group, while ORRs were similar between the two arms (66% vs. 66.7%). No significant treatment group differences were detected across all subgroups with respect to PFS, including those with elevated levels of IL6. Metformin combined with gefitinib resulted in a remarkably higher incidence of diarrhea compared with the control arm (78.38% vs. 43.24%).Our study showed that addition of metformin resulted in nonsignificantly worse outcomes and increased toxicity and hence does not support its concurrent use with first-line EGFR-TKI therapy in patients without  with EGFRm NSCLC.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499261>Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of some tetrazole acetamide derivatives as novel non-carboxylic PTP1B inhibitors.</a></h1><p>A series of ten N-(3-(1H-tetrazole-5-yl)phenyl)acetamide derivatives (NM-07 to NM-16) designed from a lead molecule identified previously in our laboratory were synthesized and evaluated for protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitory activity.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of nerve damage and sensory loss remain largely unclear. Recently, alteration in metabolic flux has gained attention as a basis for organ damage in ; however, peripheral sensory neurons have not been adequately analyzed with respect to metabolic dysfunction. In the present study, we attempted to delineate the sequence of event occurring in alteration of metabolic pathways in relation to nerve damage and sensory loss. C57Bl6/j wild-type mice were analyzed longitudinally up to 22 weeks in the streptozotocin (STZ) model of type 1 . The progression of DPN was investigated by behavioral measurements of sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli and quantitative morphological assessment of intraepidermal nerve fiber density. We employed a mass spectrometry-based screen to address alterations in levels of metabolites in peripheral sciatic nerve and amino acids in serum over several months post-STZ administration to elucidate metabolic dysfunction longitudinally in relation to sensory dysfunction. Although hyperglycemia and body weight changes occurred early, sensory loss and reduced intraepithelial branching of nociceptive nerves were only evident at 22 weeks post-STZ. The longitudinal metabolites screen in peripheral nerves demonstrated that compared with buffer-injected age-matched control mice, mice at 12 and 22 weeks post-STZ showed an early impairment the tricaoboxylic acid (TCA cycle), which is the main pathway of carbohydrate metabolism leading to energy generation. We found that levels of citric acid, ketoglutaric acid (2 KG), succinic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid were observed to be significantly reduced in sciatic nerve at 22 weeks post-STZ. In addition, we also found the increase in levels of sorbitol and L-lactate in peripheral nerve from 12 weeks post-STZ injection. Amino acid screen in serum showed that the amino acids valine (Val), isoleucine (Ile), and leucine (Leu), grouped together as BCAA, increased more than twofold from 12 weeks post-STZ. Similarly, the levels of  (Tyr), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), histidine (His), alanine (Ala), and proline (Pro) showed progressive increase with progression of . Our results indicate that the impaired TCA cycle metabolites in peripheral nerve are the primary cause of shunting metabolic substrate to compensatory pathways, which leads to sensory nerve fiber loss in skin and contribute to onset and progression of peripheral neuropathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512044>Effect of topical administration of the microneurotrophin BNN27 in the diabetic rat retina.</a></h1><p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complex eye disease associated with . It is characterized by three pathophysiological components, namely microangiopathy, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. We recently reported that intraperitoneal administration of BNN27, a novel neurosteroidal microneurotrophin, reversed the -induced neurodegeneration and inflammation in rats treated with streptozotocin (STZ), by activating the NGF TrkA and p75 receptors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of BNN27 to protect retinal neurons when applied topically as eye drops in the same model.The STZ rat model of DR was employed. BNN27 was administered as eye drops to diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats for 7 days, 4 weeks post-STZ (70 mg/kg) injection. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses were employed to examine the viability of retinal neurons in control, diabetic, and diabetic-treated animals and the involvement of the TrkA receptor and its downstream signaling ERK1/2 kinases, respectively.BNN27 reversed the STZ-induced attenuation of the immunoreactive brain nitric oxide synthetase (bNOS)- and  hydroxylase (TH)-expressing amacrine cells and neurofilament (NFL)-expressing ganglion cell axons in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, BNN27 activated/phosphorylated the TrkA receptor and its downstream prosurvival signaling pathway, ERK1/2 kinases.The results of this study provide solid evidence regarding the efficacy of BNN27 as a neuroprotectant to the diabetic retina when administered topically, and suggest that its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles render it a putative therapeutic for diabetic retinopathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301539>Boswellic extracts and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids prevent type 1 and type 2  by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.</a></h1><p>Type 1  is an autoimmune disease directed to the pancreatic islets where inflammation leads to the death of insulin-producing ß cells and insulin deficiency. Type 2 , which is closely related to overweight, is characterized by insulin resistance. In both cases, proinflammatory cytokines play an important role by causing insulitis and insulin resistance. The gum resin of Boswellia species and its pharmacologically active compounds, including 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids have been shown to suppress the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in various immune-competent cells.To review the present evidence of the therapeutic effects of boswellic extracts (BE) and/or 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids in the prevention/treatment of  and to provide comprehensive insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms.This review considers all available informations from preclinical and clinical studies concerning BEs, 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids, proinflammatory cytokines and  collected via electronic search (PubMed) and related publications of the author.Type 1 : Studies in mice with autoimmune  revealed that in the model of multiple injections of low doses of streptozotocin (MLD-STZ), an extract of the gum resin of Boswellia serrata and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acid (KBA) suppressed the increase in proinflammatory cytokines in the blood, infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and increase in blood glucose. In a second model, i.e. the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, KBA prevented the infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets. Regarding the clinical effects, a case report provided evidence that BE suppressed the blood levels of  phosphatase antibody (IA-A), a marker for insulitis, in a patient with late-onset autoimmune  of the adult (LADA). Type 2 : In a preclinical study in rats where obesity was alimentary induced, the administration of BE significantly reduced food intake, overweight, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and ameliorated the parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism. Similar results were obtained in a second animal study, where type 2  was induced by a combination of a high-fat/high-fructose diet and a single dose of streptozotocin. Two clinical trials with patients with type 2  receiving the resin of Boswellia serrata demonstrated improvement in the blood glucose, HbA and lipid parameters.Preclinical and clinical data suggest that BE and/or 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines from immune-competent cells, may prevent insulitis and insulin resistance in type 1 and type 2 , respectively, and therefore may be an option in the treatment/prevention of type 1 and type 2 . It is hypothesized that molecularly, BE and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids act via interference with the IκB kinase/Nuclear Transcription Factor-κB (IKK/NF-κB) signaling pathway through inhibition of the phosphorylation activity of IKK. However, further investigations and well-designed clinical studies are required.Copyright © 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

This study aimed to examine the morphology, biochemical levels and  phosphorylation in seminal vesicles of T1DM and T2DM mice. Fifty-six male C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups (n = 14/each): T1DM control, T1DM, T2DM control and T2DM. T1DM mice were daily injected of streptozotocin (STZ; 40 mg/kg BW) for 5 days. T2DM mice received high-fat diet for 14 days prior to STZ injection at a single dose (85 mg/kg BW). At the end of experiments (days 36 and 72), magnesium (MG) and fructosamine (FRA) levels, and phosphorylated protein expression in seminal vesicle were examined. The results showed that seminal and prostate weights and MG and FRA levels of T1DM animals were significantly increased as compared to T2DM mice. Some seminal histopathologies and decreased epithelial height were observed in both DM groups. Significantly, a 72-kDa phosphorylated protein expression was increased in DM seminal vesicle. We concluded that changes of biochemical components and phosphorylated proteins in seminal vesicle of T1DM and T2DM mice may be associated with low-quality seminal plasma.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261740>Reduced Diet-induced Thermogenesis in Apolipoprotein A-IV Deficient Mice.</a></h1><p>In the presence of dietary lipids, both apolipoprotein A-IV (ApoA-IV) production and brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis are increased. The effect of dietary lipid-induced AproA-IV on BAT thermogenesis and energy expenditure remains unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that ApoA-IV knockout (ApoA-IV-KO) mice exhibited decreased BAT thermogenesis to affect energy homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, BAT thermogenesis in wildtype (WT) and ApoA-IV-KO mice fed either a standard low-fat chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) was investigated. When fed a chow diet, energy expenditure and food intake were comparable between WT and ApoA-IV-KO mice. After 1 week of HFD consumption, ApoA-IV-KO mice had comparable energy intake but produced lower energy expenditure relative to their WT controls in the dark phase. After an acute feeding of dietary lipids or 1-week HFD feeding, ApoA-IV-KO mice produced lower levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and exhibited reduced expression of thermogenic genes in the BAT compared with WT controls. In response to cold exposure, however, ApoA-IV-KO mice had comparable energy expenditure and BAT temperature relative to WT mice.

Despite treatment availability, the 5-year survival rate in patients diagnosed at the metastatic stage is only ≈ 10%. To gain contemporary insights into RCC treatment trends that may inform clinical, scientific and payer considerations, treatment patterns and adverse events (AEs) associated with 1 L therapy were examined in a retrospective, longitudinal, population-based, observational study of patients with mRCC.US administrative claims data (Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Databases) were used to assess trends in 1 L treatment initiation in mRCC (2006-2015) and characterize patterns of individual 1 L treatments, baseline characteristics, comorbidities and treatment-related AEs from 2011 through 2015. Outcomes were evaluated by drug class and route of administration.Ten-year trend analysis (n = 4270) showed that TK/VEGF-directed therapy rapidly became more common than mTOR-directed therapy, and oral treatments were favored over intravenous (IV) treatments. Overall, 1992 eligible patients initiated 1 L treatment for mRCC from 2011 through 2015: 1752 (88%) received TK/VEGF-directed agents and 233 (12%) received mTOR-directed agents; 1674 (84%) received oral treatments, and 318 (16%) received IV treatments. The most common 1 L treatment was sunitinib (n = 849), followed by pazopanib (n = 631), temsirolimus (n = 157) and bevacizumab (n = 154). Patient characteristics and comorbidities, including age,  and congestive heart failure, were independent predictors of 1 L mRCC treatment choice. The three most common potentially 1 L treatment-related AEs were nausea/vomiting (128.2 per 100 patient-years [PY]), hypertension (69 per 100 PY) and renal insufficiency (44.6 per 100 PY). A wide variety of agents were used as second-line (2 L) therapy. Substantial latency of onset was observed for several potentially treatment-related toxicities in patients treated with TK/VEGF- or mTOR-directed agents.In the US, 1 L TK/VEGF inhibitor uptake in recent years appears largely in line with national approvals and guidelines, with varied 2 L agent use.

Oxidative stress-responsive apoptosis-inducing protein (ORAIP; a -sulfated secreted form of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A [eIF5A]) is a recently discovered pro-apoptotic ligand that is secreted from cells in response to oxidative stress and induces apoptosis in an autocrine fashion. This study aimed to determine if ORAIP plays a role in DR.To investigate the role of ORAIP in DR, we analyzed the levels of ORAIP in the vitreous body and their relationship with the extent of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify the levels of ORAIP, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-8 in the vitreous body of 40 eyes from 28 patients with PDR and 11 patients with non-PDR (NPDR). We also analyzed the expression of ORAIP in insoluble proliferative tissues from vitreous body samples by immunofluorescent staining.The vitreous body concentration of ORAIP was significantly (P = 0.0433) higher in the PDR group (52.26 ± 8.68 [mean ± SE] ng/mL, n = 29) than in the NPDR group (28.21 ± 7.30 ng/mL, n = 11). However, there were no significant correlations between the concentration of ORAIP and those of VEGF, IL-6, CCL2, or IL-8. ORAIP expression was observed in the insoluble proliferative tissues in vitreous body samples of most patients in the PDR group, whereas almost no expression of ORAIP was observed in patients in the NPDR group.Our findings strongly suggest that ORAIP plays a role in oxidative stress-induced retinal injury and may be a sensitive diagnostic marker and a promising therapeutic target for oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643448>Sunitinib.</a></h1><p>Sunitinib is multi-specific  kinase receptor inhibitor that is used in the therapy of gastrointestinal stromal tumors and advanced renal cell carcinoma.

An increase in the sFlt-1 level is associated with alterations of endothelial integrity. In contrast, vitamin D exerts a protective effect and low concentrations of 25(OH)D may have an adverse effect on common complications of pregnancy, such as gestational hypertension (GH), preeclampsia (PE), and gestational  (GDM). The aim of this study was to analyze the levels of sFlt-1 in Polish women with physiological pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by GH, PE, and GDM. Moreover, we analyzed relationships between the maternal serum sFlt-1 level and the sFlt-1 to 25(OH)D ratio and the risk of GH and PE.The study included 171 women with complicated pregnancies; among them are 45 with GH, 23 with PE, and 103 with GDM. The control group was comprised of 36 women with physiological pregnancies. Concentrations of sFl-1 and 25(OH)D were measured before delivery, with commercially available immunoassays.Women with GH differed significantly from the controls in terms of their serum sFlt-1 levels (5797 pg/ml vs. 3531 pg/ml,  = 0.0014). Moreover, a significant difference in sFlt-1 concentrations was found between women with PE and those with physiological pregnancies (6074 pg/ml vs. 3531 pg/ml,  < 0.0001). GDM did not exert a statistically significant effect on serum sFlt-1 levels. Both logistic regression and ROC analysis demonstrated that elevated concentration of sFlt-1 was associated with greater risk of GH (AUC = 0.70,  = 0.0001) and PE (AUC = 0.82,  < 0.0001). Also, the sFlt-1 to 25(OH)D ratio, with the cutoff values of 652 (AUC = 0.74,  < 0.0001) and 653 (AUC = 0.88,  < 0.0001), respectively, was identified as a significant predictor of GH and PE.Determination of the sFlt-1/25(OH)D ratio might provide additional important information and, thus, be helpful in the identification of patients with PE and GH, facilitating their qualification for intensive treatment and improving the neonatal outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117294>NMR-Based Metabolomic Approach Tracks Potential Serum Biomarkers of Disease Progression in Patients with Type 2 .</a></h1><p>Type 2  (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia associated with alterations in carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism. The prognosis of T2DM patients is highly dependent on the development of complications, and therefore the identification of biomarkers of T2DM progression, with minimally invasive techniques, is a huge need. In the present study, we applied a H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H-NMR)-based metabolomic approach coupled with multivariate data analysis to identify serum metabolite profiles associated with T2DM development and progression. To perform this, we compared the serum metabolome of non-diabetic subjects, treatment-naïve non-complicated T2DM patients, and T2DM patients with complications in insulin monotherapy. Our analysis revealed a significant reduction of alanine, glutamine, glutamate, leucine, lysine, methionine, , and phenylalanine in T2DM patients with respect to non-diabetic subjects. Moreover, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, , and valine levels distinguished complicated patients from patients without complications. Overall, the metabolic pathway analysis suggested that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism is significantly compromised in T2DM patients with complications, while perturbation in the metabolism of gluconeogenic amino acids other than BCAAs characterizes both early and advanced T2DM stages. In conclusion, we identified a metabolic serum signature associated with T2DM stages. These data could be integrated with clinical characteristics to build a composite T2DM/complications risk score to be validated in a prospective cohort.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31112893>An update about the crucial role of stereochemistry on the effects of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor ligands.</a></h1><p>Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that govern lipid and glucose homeostasis playing a central role in cardiovascular disease, obesity, and . These receptors show a high degree of stereoselectivity towards several classes of drugs. This review covers the most relevant findings that have been made in the last decade and takes into consideration only those compounds in which stereochemistry led to unexpected results or peculiar interactions with the receptors. These cases are reviewed and discussed with the aim to show how enantiomeric recognition originates at the molecular level. The structural characterization by crystallographic methods and docking experiments of complexes formed by PPARs with their ligands turns out to be an essential tool to explain receptor stereoselectivity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Patients suffering from this disease can currently be treated with numerous oral anti-hyperglycaemic drugs, but none is capable of reproducing the physiological action of insulin and, in several cases, they induce severe side effects. Developing new anti-diabetic drugs remains one of the most urgent challenges of the pharmaceutical industry. Multi-target drugs could offer new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of T2D, and the reported data on type 2 diabetic mice models indicate that these drugs could be more effective and have fewer side effects than mono-target drugs. α-Glucosidases and Protein  Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) are considered important targets for the treatment of T2D: the first digest oligo- and disaccharides in the gut, while the latter regulates the insulin-signaling pathway. With the aim of generating new drugs able to target both enzymes, we synthesized a series of bifunctional compounds bearing both a nitro aromatic group and an iminosugar moiety. The results of tests carried out both in vitro and in a cell-based model, show that these bifunctional compounds maintain activity on both target enzymes and, more importantly, show a good insulin-mimetic activity, increasing phosphorylation levels of Akt in the absence of insulin stimulation. These compounds could be used to develop a new generation of anti-hyperglycemic drugs useful for the treatment of patients affected by T2D.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we systematically examined the in vivo and in vitro anti-diabetic activities of natural flavonoids 1-6 from Chrysanthemum morifolium. Flavonoids 1-6 increased glucose consumption-promoting activity and the phosphorylation of GSK-3β and Akt, and decreased PTP-1B protein level along with slightly inhibitory activity of the PTP-1B enzyme. Moreover, flavonoids 1-2 treatment induced insulin secretion in INS-1 cells. Besides, in vivo study revealed that flavonoids 2 and 5 demonstrated potent anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic activity, and improved maltose and glucose tolerance. Although flavonoid 2 exhibited lower inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase in vitro, it could deglycosylated in vivo to diosmetin to function as an α-glucosidase inhibitor. Taken together, these results led to the identification of the natural flavonoids 1-6 from C. morifolium as dual regulators of α-glucosidase and the PTP-1B signaling pathway, suggesting their potential application as new oral anti-diabetic drugs or functional food ingredients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although the intestinal L-cell hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide - (PYY) have attracted the most attention, direct tests in humans and rodents with pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of either the GLP1-receptor (GLP1R) or the Y2-receptor (Y2R) were unable to confirm their critical roles in the beneficial effects gastric bypass surgery on body weight and glucose homeostasis. However, new awareness of the power of combinatorial therapies in the treatment of metabolic disease would suggest that combined blockade of more than one signaling pathway may be necessary to reverse the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.The metabolic effects of high-fat diet and the ability of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery to lower food intake and body weight, as well as improve glucose handling, was tested in GLP1R and Y2R-double knockout (GLP1RKO/Y2RKO) and C57BL6J wildtype (WT) mice.GLP1RKO/Y2RKO and WT mice responded similarly for up to 20 weeks on high-fat diet and 16 weeks after RYGB. There were no significant differences in loss of body and liver weight, fat mass, reduced food intake, relative increase in energy expenditure, improved fasting insulin, glucose tolerance, and insulin tolerance between WT and GLP1RKO/Y2RKO mice after RYGB.Combined loss of GLP1R and Y2R-signaling was not able to negate or attenuate the beneficial effects of RYGB on body weight and glucose homeostasis in mice, suggesting that a larger number of signaling pathways is involved or that the critical pathway has not yet been identified.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

With the development of new instruments and techniques, the popularity of laparoscopic resection of GISTs has increased rapidly. Previous studies on the advantages of laparoscopic resection over open surgery are generally limited by methodology or data capacity. This study evaluated the efficacy of laparoscopic resection and open surgery in gastric GISTs using the propensity score matching (PSM) method.Between January 2005 and December 2017, 1027 patients were diagnosed with primary GIST at our institution. Among them, 548 patients were enrolled in this study. Standard demographic and clinicopathological data were collected from our database. Selection bias was eliminated using the PSM methods.After PSM, 256 cases involved in the comparison (128 laparoscopic (LAP) vs. 128 open surgery (OPEN)) were randomly matched (1:1) by age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, , heart disease, year of surgery, tumor location, tumor size, mitotic rate, and treatment with adjuvant  kinase inhibitors. The LAP group was superior to the OPEN group in blood loss (χ = 6.048, P = 0.049), time to first flatus (49.41 ± 7.56 vs. 71.31 ± 4.87 h, P < 0.001), and hospital stay (10.21 ± 6.05 vs. 12.56 ± 5.43 days, P = 0.001). No significant differences were seen in either the relapse-free survival or overall survival between the LAP and OPEN groups. In tumors located in favorable locations, the LAP group showed less blood loss (P = 0.008) and less multivisceral resection (17.8% vs. 5.5%, P = 0.02).Laparoscopic resection for gastric GISTs is associated with improved surgical outcomes and postoperative courses and comparable oncological outcomes, regardless of favorable or unfavorable tumor location.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186313>A Phase I Trial of the VEGF Receptor  Kinase Inhibitor Pazopanib in Combination with the MEK Inhibitor Trametinib in Advanced Solid Tumors and Differentiated Thyroid Cancers.</a></h1><p>Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) responds to VEGF receptor inhibitors.

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the association of diabetic kidney diseases with PFOA and PFOS. However, mechanisms of metabolic alterations involved are still unclear.Considering their involvement of glomerular hemodynamics, rat mesangial cells (MCs) are used as an in vitro model of diabetic kidney diseases for exposure to PFOS/PFOA under diabetic condition. Non-targeted metabolomics studies based on liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry were conducted to determine how PFOA/PFOS promoted fibrotic and proinflammatory responses in the MCs under diabetic condition.Exposure of PFOA/PFOS (10 μM) increased oxidative stress and the levels of fibrotic and proinflammatory markers in MCs under diabetic condition. We demonstrated for the first time that PFOA and PFOS altered amino acid biosynthesis, citrate cycle, and purine metabolism in MCs under diabetic condition. Compared with diabetic condition, the exposure of PFOA and PFOS under diabetic condition more significantly altered the levels of 13 intracellular metabolites, including , L-phenylalanine, L-arginine, L-tryptophan, AMP, ADP, UMP, inosine, and hypoxanthine, which have been reported to be related to kidney injury. In addition, PFOA/PFOS treatment significantly altered the expression levels of key enzymes involved in these metabolisms. Treatment with , L-phenylalanine, L-arginine, and L-tryptophan reduced the levels of fibrotic and inflammatory markers induced by PFOA/PFOS.Our results suggest that under diabetic condition, exposure of PFOA or PFOS aggravated diabetic kidney injury in vitro by impairing metabolisms of amino acids and purines to induce more fibrosis and inflammation in MCs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

As glycemic control alone does not prevent complications, we hypothesized that these metabolic disruptions are responsible for the development and progression of diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN). We performed standardized cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests and targeted fasting plasma metabolomic analysis of amino acids and TCA cycle intermediates in subjects with type 1  and healthy control subjects followed for 3 years. Forty-seven participants with type 1  (60% female and mean ± SD age 35 ± 13 years,  duration 13 ± 7 years, and HbA 7.9 ± 1.2%) had lower fumarate levels and higher threonine, serine, proline, asparagine, aspartic acid, phenylalanine, , and histidine levels compared with 10 age-matched healthy control subjects. Higher baseline fumarate levels and lower baseline amino acid levels-asparagine and glutamine-correlate with CAN (lower baseline SD of normal R-R interval [SDNN]). Baseline glutamine and ornithine levels also associated with the progression of CAN (lower SDNN at 3 years) and change in SDNN, respectively, after adjustment for baseline HbA, blood glucose, BMI, cholesterol, urine microalbumin-to- creatinine ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and years of . Therefore, significant changes in the anaplerotic flux into the TCA cycle could be the critical defect underlying CAN progression.© 2019 by the American  Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30944100>The natural history of vascular and other complications in patients treated with nilotinib for chronic myeloid leukemia.</a></h1><p>Although second-generation  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) show superiority in achieving deep molecular responses in chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) compared with imatinib, the differing adverse effect (AE) profiles need consideration when deciding the best drug for individual patients. Long-term data from randomized trials of nilotinib demonstrate an increased risk of vascular AEs (VAEs) compared with other TKIs, although the natural history of these events in response to dose modifications or cessation has not been fully characterized. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence of nilotinib-associated AEs in 220 patients with CML-CP at 17 Australian institutions. Overall, AEs of any grade were reported in 95 patients (43%) and prompted nilotinib cessation in 46 (21%). VAEs occurred in 26 patients (12%), with an incidence of 4.1 events per 100 patient-years. Multivariate analysis identified age ( = .022) and dyslipidemia ( = .007) as independent variables for their development. There was 1 fatal first VAE, whereas the remaining patients either continued nilotinib (14 patients) or stopped it immediately (11 patients). Recurrent VAEs were associated with ongoing therapy in 7 of 14 who continued (with 2 fatal VAEs) vs 1 of 11 who discontinued ( = .04). Nineteen of the 23 evaluable patients surviving a VAE ultimately stopped nilotinib, of whom 14 received an alternative TKI. Dose reduction or cessation because of VAEs did not adversely affect maintenance of major molecular response. These findings demonstrate that in contrast to other AEs, VAEs are ideally managed with nilotinib cessation because of the increased risk of additional events with its ongoing use.© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644181>Midostaurin.</a></h1><p>Midostaurin is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of FMS-like  kinase 3 (FLT3) which is used as an antineoplastic agent in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia with FLT3 mutations.

Chronic inflammation is considered part of the pathogenic mechanisms of different disorders associated with aging. Interestingly, peripheral inflammation and the associated metabolic alterations not only facilitate insulin resistance and  but also neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the identification of novel pathways, common to the development of these diseases, which modulate the immune response and signaling is key. It will provide highly relevant information to advance our knowledge of the multifactorial process of aging, and to establish new biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets to counteract the underlying chronic inflammatory processes. One novel pathway that regulates peripheral and central immune responses is triggered by the cytokines pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK), which bind its receptor, Receptor Protein  Phosphatase (RPTP) β/ζ, and inactivate its phosphatase activity. In this review, we compile a growing body of knowledge suggesting that PTN and MK modulate the immune response and/or inflammation in different pathologies characterized by peripheral inflammation associated with insulin resistance, such as aging, and in central disorders characterized by overt neuroinflammation, such as neurodegenerative diseases and endotoxemia. Evidence strongly suggests that regulation of the PTN and MK signaling pathways may provide new therapeutic opportunities particularly in those neurological disorders characterized by increased PTN and/or MK cerebral levels and neuroinflammation. Importantly, we discuss existing therapeutics, and others being developed, that modulate these signaling pathways, and their potential use in pathologies characterized by overt neuroinflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31165274>In the Search of Glycoside-Based Molecules as Antidiabetic Agents.</a></h1><p>This review is an effort to summarize recent developments in synthesis of O-glycosides and N-, C-glycosyl molecules with promising antidiabetic potential.

First, the O-glycosides used in the treatment of  are presented, followed by the N-glycosides and finally the C-glycosides constituting the largest group of antidiabetic drugs are described. Within each group of glycosides, we presented how the structure of compounds representing potential drugs changes and when discussing chemical compounds of a similar structure, achievements are presented in the chronological order. C-Glycosyl compounds mimicking O-glycosides structure, exhibit the best features in terms of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Therefore, the largest part of the article is concerned with the description of the synthesis and biological studies of various C-glycosides. Also N-glycosides such as N-(β-D-glucopyranosyl)-amides, N-(β-D-glucopyranosyl)-ureas, and 1,2,3-triazolyl derivatives belong to the most potent classes of antidiabetic agents. In order to indicate which of the compounds presented in the given sections have the best inhibitory properties, a list of the best inhibitors is presented at the end of each section. In summary, the best inhibitors were selected from each of the summarizing figures and the results of the ranking were placed. In this way, the reader can learn about the structure of the compounds having the best antidiabetic activity. The compounds, whose synthesis was described in the article but did not appear on the figures presenting the structures of the most active inhibitors, did not show proper activity as inhibitors.

Here, we assessed amino acid levels in relation to incident prediabetes among initially normoglycemic African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA).Using a nested case-control design, we studied 70 adults (35 AA, 35 EA) who developed prediabetes (progressors) and 70 matched participants who maintained normoglycemia (nonprogressors) during 5.5 years of follow-up in the Pathobiology of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort study. Assessments included plasma amino acid levels, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell function.The total level of all 18 amino acid assayed was significantly associated with lean mass (r = 0.36, P < 0.0001), waist circumference (r = 0.27, P = 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.24, P = 0.005), HOMA-IR (r = 0.22, P = 0.01) and HDL cholesterol (r = -0.18, P = 0.03). Individual amino acid levels were significantly associated with insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Compared with nonprogressors, progressors had higher baseline levels of asparagine and aspartic acid (P <0.0001), glutamine/glutamic acid (P = 0.005) and phenylalanine (P = 0.02), and lower histidine (P = 0.02) levels. In fully-adjusted logistic regression models, aspartic acid/asparagine (OR 2.72 [95% CI 1.91-3.87]) and histidine (OR 0.90 [95% CI 0.85-0.96]) were the only amino acids that significantly predicted incident prediabetes.Baseline plasma aspartic acid and asparagine levels predicted progression to prediabetes, whereas histidine levels were protective of prediabetes risk. Thus, the amino acid signature associated with prediabetes in a diverse population may be distinct from that previously linked to T2DM in Caucasians.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Global Metabolomics Screen Reveals Brown Adipose Tissue Changes in Amino Acids, Catecholamines, and Antioxidants After Short-Term Restriction in C57BL/6 Mice.</a></h1><p>Animals undergoing calorie restriction (CR) often lower their body temperature to conserve energy. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is stimulated through norepinephrine when rapid heat production is needed, as it is highly metabolically active due to the uncoupling of the electron transport chain from ATP synthesis. To better understand how BAT metabolism changes with CR, we used metabolomics to identify 883 metabolites that were significantly differentially expressed in the BAT of C57BL/6 mice, fed graded CR (10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% CR relative to their individual baseline intake), compared with mice fed ad libitum (AL) for 12 hours a day. Pathway analysis revealed that graded CR had an impact on the TCA cycle and fatty acid degradation. In addition, an increase in nucleic acids and catecholamine pathways was seen with graded CR in the BAT metabolome. We saw increases in antioxidants with CR, suggesting a beneficial effect of mitochondrial uncoupling. Importantly, the instigator of BAT activation, norepinephrine, was increased with CR, whereas its precursors  and dopamine were decreased, indicating a shift of metabolites through the activation pathway. Several of these key changes were correlated with food anticipatory activity and body temperature, indicating BAT activation may be driven by responses to hunger.© The Author(s) 2019.

PYY3-36 twice a day for one week). Food intake, water intake, body weight (b.w.), visceral fat weight (VFW), liver glycogen content, serum levels of glucose, insulin, and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were measured. Homeostatic-model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was estimated. The gene expression of the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and visceral nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were assessed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).The PYY3-36 administration to the diabetic group of rats significantly increased the serum insulin levels and liver glycogen content, decreased the body weight, VFW, food intake, water intake, serum levels of the glucose, IL-6, and HOMA-IR. It also decreased the expression of both the hypothalamic NPY and the visceral fat NF-κB.With respect to the fact of improved insulin release and enhanced insulin sensitivity (an effect that may be mediated via suppressing accumulation of visceral fat and inflammatory markers), in the rats treated with PYY3-36, the PYY3-36 might be considered for the future as a promising therapeutic tool in T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643968>Cobimetinib.</a></h1><p>Cobimetinib is a  kinase receptor inhibitor that is used in combination with vemurafenib as therapy for selected forms of advanced malignant melanoma.

Recently, some studies have reported the role of inflammation in DM-induced β-cell destruction. Nilotinib hydrochloride, a  kinase inhibitor is a well-known anticancer with numerous medical benefits. In the present study, DM was induced by single I.P. injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (50 mg/kg). Daily oral nilotinib (10 mg/kg) and (20 mg/kg) for 4 weeks induced a significant attenuation of DM signs in rats and their assessed lab values. Nilotinib induced a dose-dependent significant escalation in serum insulin level with a significant reduction in blood glucose and glucagon levels. Nevertheless, biomarkers of cell injury, tissue necrosis, and apoptosis; caspase-3 were significantly reduced. Moreover, pancreatic antioxidants defenses of which; thioredoxin, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities, reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration, and total antioxidant capacity significantly improved with a simultaneous reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Histopathologically, nilotinib treatment was associated with a minimal pancreatic injury with a significant restoration of insulin content in β-islets. In addition, nilotinib treatment revealed a significant reduction in infiltration of macrophages in β-cells. In conclusion: nilotinib's ameliorative impact on DM may be attributed to both nilotinib's mediated protection and preservation of pancreatic β islets function and the improvement in serum insulin levels and hence the improvement of blood glucose.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Urinary PlGF and serum PlGF, sFLT-1, and the sFLT-1-to-PlGF ratio were assessed four times (14, 24, 30, and 36 weeks' gestation), and the association with the outcome of preeclampsia was investigated.A correlation between urinary and serum PlGF was demonstrated from 24 weeks' gestation onward ( < 0.001). At all time points, those who developed preeclampsia had lower serum PlGF levels ( < 0.05), and receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated that serum PlGF in this cohort performed better than the serum sFLT-1-to-PlGF ratio as a predictive test for preeclampsia.

We established methods that reliably measure insulin, adiponectin and leptin signaling, and their crosstalk, in thawed postmortem mid-frontal cortical tissue from cognitively normal older subjects with a short postmortem interval. Insulin-evoked insulin receptor (IR) activation increases activated, -phosphorylated IRβ on  residues 960, 1150, and 1151, insulin receptor substrate-1 recruitment to IRβ and phosphorylated RAC-α-serine/threonine-protein kinase. Adiponectin augments, but leptin inhibits, insulin signaling. Adiponectin activates adiponectin receptors to induce APPL1 binding to adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 and T-cadherin and downstream adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. Insulin inhibited adiponectin-induced signaling. In addition, leptin-induced leptin receptor (OB-R) signaling promotes Janus kinase 2 recruitment to OB-R and Janus kinase 2 and downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation. Insulin enhanced leptin signaling. These data demonstrate insulin and adipokine signaling interactions in human brain. Future studies can use these methods to examine insulin, adiponectin, and leptin metabolic dysregulation in aging and disease states, such as type 2  and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

While renal dysfunction is an adverse event of TKI, data on this adverse event in TKI-treated DTC remains insufficient. Here, we investigated renal function in patients undergoing TKI treatment for DTC and evaluated the efficacy of dose reduction/withdrawal for cases of renal dysfunction.A total of 73 cases of radioactive iodine-refractory DTC treated with sorafenib (n = 22) or lenvatinib (n = 51) were included. Patient data evaluated were TKI treatment period, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) before and after TKI therapy, incidence and degree (maximum value at time of TKI treatment) of proteinuria, and albumin levels before and after TKI therapy were compared.The mean ΔeGFR was -6.75% with lenvatinib and +5.90% with sorafenib. It was not significant (P = .15). The mean Δalbumin was -8.90% and -5.85% with lenvatinib and sorafenib, respectively; there was no significant difference between the lenvatinib and sorafenib groups (P = .77). According to our program of TKI dose reduction and withdrawal, all patients except 2 with  were successfully continuing treatment.Overall, the present results demonstrated that renal function is negatively affected by long-term TKI treatment for RAI-refractory DTC.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce  expression have been linked with the development of various autoimmune disorders, including type 1 . The  phosphatase PTPN2 attenuates T-cell receptor and cytokine signaling in T cells to maintain peripheral tolerance, but the extent to which PTPN2 deficiency in T cells might influence type 1  onset remains unclear. NOD mice develop spontaneous autoimmune type 1  similar to that seen in humans. In this study, T-cell PTPN2 deficiency in NOD mice markedly accelerated the onset and increased the incidence of type 1  as well as that of other disorders, including colitis and Sjögren syndrome. Although PTPN2 deficiency in CD8 T cells alone was able to drive the destruction of pancreatic β-cells and the onset of , T-cell-specific PTPN2 deficiency was also accompanied by increased CD4 T-helper type 1 differentiation and T-follicular-helper cell polarization and increased the abundance of B cells in pancreatic islets as seen in human type 1 .

This study identifies the protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) as a potential modulator of islet graft revascularization. We demonstrate that grafts of pancreatic islets lacking PTP1B exhibit increased revascularization, which is accompanied by improved graft survival and function, and recovery of normoglycemia and glucose tolerance in diabetic mice transplanted with PTP1B-deficient islets. Mechanistically, we show that the absence of PTP1B leads to activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α-independent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α/estrogen-related receptor α signaling and enhanced expression and production of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) by β cells. These observations were reproduced in human islets. Together, these findings reveal that PTP1B regulates islet VEGF-A production and suggest that this phosphatase could be targeted to improve islet transplantation outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Associations of these SNPs with the susceptibility of T1D were determined by χ test. LCKs were knocked out in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using CRISPR-Cas9 to investigate the role of LCK SNP in T-lymphocyte activation in T1D.SNP rs10914542 but not the other six SNPs of the LCK gene was significantly associated with (C vs. G, odds ratio (OR) = 0.581, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.470-0.718, P value = 4.13E - 7) the susceptibility of T1D.

Apart from pain, PDN is also characterized by morphine hyposensitivity. Intriguingly, in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats exhibiting marked morphine hyposensitivity, dietary administration of the nitric oxide (NO) precursor, L-arginine at 1 g/d, progressively rescued morphine efficacy and potency over an 8-week treatment period. In earlier work, single bolus doses of the furoxan nitric oxide (NO) donor, PRG150 (3-methylfuroxan-4-carbaldehyde), evoked dose-dependent pain relief in STZ-diabetic rats but the efficacious doses were 3-4 orders of magnitude higher in advanced  than that required in early STZ . Together, these findings suggested a role for NO in the modulation of μ-opioid (MOP) receptor signalling. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess a role for NO released from PRG150, in modulating MOP receptor function in vitro. Here, we show an absolute requirement for the MOP receptor, but not the δ-opioid (DOP) or the κ-opioid (KOP) receptor, to transduce the cellular effects of PRG150 on forskolin-stimulated cAMP responses in vitro. PRG150 did not interact with the classical naloxone-sensitive binding site of the MOP receptor, and its effects on cAMP responses in HEK-MOP cells were also naloxone-insensitive. Nevertheless, the inhibitory effects of PRG150 on forskolin-stimulated cAMP responses in HEK-MOP cells were dependent upon pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins as well as membrane lipid rafts and src kinase. Together, our findings implicate a role for NO in modulating MOP receptor function in vivo.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31125535>A review on protective role of genistein against oxidative stress in  and related complications.</a></h1><p> (DM) is metabolism related problems that share the phenotype of hyperglycemia, which is triggered by a complicated interaction of hereditary and environmental elements.

IL-10-deficient mice and patients with mutations in IL-10 or its receptor, IL-10R, show increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) controls immune cell activation and the equilibrium between regulatory and effector T cells, playing an important role in controlling immune homoeostasis of the gut. Here, we examined the role of PTPN22 in intestinal inflammation of IL-10-deficient (IL-10 ) mice. We crossed IL-10 mice with PTPN22 mice to generate PTPN22 IL-10 double knock-out mice and induced colitis with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). In line with previous reports, DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis was exacerbated in IL-10 mice compared to wild-type (WT) controls. However, PTPN22 IL-10 double knock-out mice developed milder disease compared to IL-10 mice. IL-17-promoting innate cytokines and T helper type 17 (Th17) cells were markedly increased in PTPN22 IL-10 mice, but did not provide a protctive function. CXCL1/KC was also increased in PTPN22 IL-10 mice, but therapeutic injection of CXCL1/KC in IL-10 mice did not ameliorate colitis. These results show that PTPN22 promotes intestinal inflammation in IL-10-deficient mice, suggesting that therapeutic targeting of PTPN22 might be beneficial in patients with IBD and mutations in IL-10 and IL-10R.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015435>Gut microbiome-derived phenyl sulfate contributes to albuminuria in diabetic kidney disease.</a></h1><p>Diabetic kidney disease is a major cause of renal failure that urgently necessitates a breakthrough in disease management.

In vitro, the inhibition of ITAM-FcγRs was investigated using rat chromaffin cells cultured with high glucose.Aged rats with  exhibited marked and persistent learning and memory impairments. Enhanced cerebral inflammation in the diabetic aged rats was associated with the overactivation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway and the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor nuclear factor-α (TNF-α)) in the hippocampus. Compared to no treatment, the knockdown of FcγRIV (the main isoform of ITAM-FcγRs) markedly attenuated cognitive impairment as well as histologic and ultrastructural pathologic changes in the diabetic rats. The increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and the overactivation of the NF-κB signaling pathway were also significantly alleviated.

Therapeutic use of cell transplantation requires many cells, however, the expansion process needed to produce large quantities of cells reduces the differentiation potential of MSCs. Here, we examined the protective effects of low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on the maintenance of osteogenic potency. Primary osteoblastic cells were serially passaged between 2 and 12 times with daily LIPUS treatment. We found that LIPUS stimulation maintains osteogenic differentiation capacity in serially passaged cells, as characterized by improved matrix mineralization and Osteocalcin mRNA expression. Decreased expression of Nanog, Sox2, and Msx2, and increased expression of Pparg2 from serial passaging was recovered in LIPUS-stimulated cells. We found that LIPUS stimulation not only increased but also sustained expression of Nanog in primary osteoblasts and ST2 cells, a mouse mesenchymal stromal cell line. Nanog overexpression in serially passaged cells mimicked the recuperative effects of LIPUS on osteogenic potency, highlighting the important role of Nanog in LIPUS stimulation. Additionally, we found that spleen  kinase (Syk) is an important signaling molecule to induce Nanog expression in LIPUS-stimulated cells. Syk activation was regulated by both Rho-associated kinase 1 (ROCK1) and extracellular ATP in a paracrine manner. Interestingly, the LIPUS-induced increase in Nanog mRNA expression was regulated by ATP-P2X4-Syk Y323 activation, while the improvement of Nanog protein stability was controlled by the ROCK1-Syk Y525/526 pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that LIPUS stimulation recovers and maintains the osteogenic potency of serially passaged cells through a Syk-Nanog axis.Copyright © 2019.

In this work, we have studied the impact of different types of honey on insulin signalling pathway. We found that honey extracts inhibit the enzyme PTP1B, one of the main negative regulators of insulin receptor signalling. HPLC-MS analysis allowed us to confirm the presence of several natural PTP1B inhibitors in the honey extracts analysed. Statistical analysis methods show a correlation between specific H-NMR resonance frequencies/HPLC peaks and the inhibitory power of the samples. This finding will allow the prediction of the biological properties of honey samples applying relative simple analytical methods. Finally, we demonstrated that the treatment of HepG2 cells with honey extracts enhances the expression of insulin receptor, and stimulates glucose uptake. For the first time, our results demonstrate that bioactive components of honey could improve glycaemic control by both inhibiting PTP1B and stimulating the expression of insulin receptor in liver cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Germline inactivating Gα mutations lead to obesity in humans and mice. Mice with brain-specific Gα deficiency also develop obesity with reduced energy expenditure and locomotor activity, and impaired adaptive thermogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.We created mice (DMHGsKO) with Gα deficiency limited to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and examined the effects on energy balance and thermogenesis.DMHGsKO mice developed severe, early-onset obesity associated with hyperphagia and reduced energy expenditure and locomotor activity, along with impaired brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Studies in mice with loss of MC4R in the DMH suggest that defective DMH MC4R/Gα signaling contributes to abnormal energy balance but not to abnormal locomotor activity or cold-induced thermogenesis. Instead, DMHGsKO mice had impaired leptin signaling along with increased expression of the leptin signaling inhibitor protein  phosphatase 1B in the DMH, which likely contributes to the observed hyperphagia and reductions in energy expenditure, locomotor activity, and cold-induced thermogenesis.DMH Gα signaling is critical for energy balance, thermogenesis, and leptin signaling. This study provides insight into how distinct signaling pathways can interact to regulate energy homeostasis and temperature regulation.Published by Elsevier GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625779>Increased arrhythmia susceptibility in type 2 diabetic mice related to dysregulation of ventricular sympathetic innervation.</a></h1><p>Patients with type 2  (T2DM) have a greater risk of developing life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Since the underlying mechanisms and potential influence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy are not well understood, we aimed to assess the relevance of a dysregulation in cardiac autonomic tone.Ventricular arrhythmia susceptibility was increased in Langendorff-perfused hearts isolated from mice with T2DM (db/db). Membrane properties and synaptic transmission were similar at cardiac postganglionic parasympathetic neurons from diabetic and control mice; however, a greater asynchronous neurotransmitter release was present at sympathetic postganglionic neurons from the stellate ganglia of db/db mice. Western blot analysis showed a reduction of  hydroxylase (TH) from the ventricles of db/db mice, which was confirmed with confocal imaging as a heterogeneous loss of TH-immunoreactivity from the left ventricular wall but not the apex. In-vivo stimulation of cardiac parasympathetic (vagus) or cardiac sympathetic (stellate ganglion) nerves induced similar changes in heart rate in control and db/db mice and the kinetics of pacing-induced Ca transients, recorded from isolated cardiomyocytes, were similar in control and db/db cells. Antagonism of cardiac muscarinic receptors did not affect the frequency or severity of arrhythmias in db/db mice, but sympathetic blockade with propranolol completely inhibited arrhythmogenicity.Collectively, these findings suggest that the increased ventricular arrhythmia susceptibility of type 2 diabetic mouse hearts is due to dysregulation of the sympathetic ventricular control.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30979722>ICA512 RESP18 homology domain is a protein-condensing factor and insulin fibrillation inhibitor.</a></h1><p>Type 1  islet cell autoantigen 512 (ICA512/IA-2) is a  phosphatase-like intrinsic membrane protein involved in the biogenesis and turnover of insulin secretory granules (SGs) in pancreatic islet β-cells. Whereas its membrane-proximal and cytoplasmic domains have been functionally and structurally characterized, the role of the ICA512 N-terminal segment named "regulated endocrine-specific protein 18 homology domain" (RESP18HD), which encompasses residues 35-131, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that ICA512 RESP18HD residues 91-131 encode for an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which  acts as a condensing factor for the reversible aggregation of insulin and other β-cell proteins in a pH and Zn-regulated fashion. At variance with what has been shown for other granule cargoes with aggregating properties, the condensing activity of ICA512 RESP18HD is displayed at a pH close to neutral,  in the pH range found in the early secretory pathway, whereas it is resolved at acidic pH and Zn concentrations resembling those present in mature SGs. Moreover, we show that ICA512 RESP18HD residues 35-90, preceding the IDR, inhibit insulin fibrillation  Finally, we found that glucose-stimulated secretion of RESP18HD upon exocytosis of SGs from insulinoma INS-1 cells is associated with cleavage of its IDR, conceivably to prevent its aggregation upon exposure to neutral pH in the extracellular milieu. Taken together, these findings point to ICA512 RESP18HD being a condensing factor for protein sorting and granulogenesis early in the secretory pathway and for prevention of amyloidogenesis.© 2019 Toledo et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643365>Omacetaxine.</a></h1><p>Omacetaxine is a semisynthetic cephataxine that acts as a protein translation inhibitor and is used to treated chronic myeloid leukemia that is resistant to  kinase receptor antagonists.

Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2  affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related.  levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2  with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

Herein, we reported a highly specific PTP1B inhibitor 2,2',3,3'-tetrabromo-4,4',5,5'-tetrahydroxydiphenylmethane (compound 1), which showed promising hypoglycemic activity in diabetic BKS db mice. With the IC value of 2.4 μM, compound 1 could directly bind to the catalytic pocket of PTP1B through a series of hydrogen bonds. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the target affinity [KD (equilibrium dissociation constant) value] of compound 1 binding to PTP1B was 2.90 μM. Moreover, compound 1 could activate the insulin signaling pathway in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. We further evaluated the long-term effects of compound 1 in diabetic BKS db mice. Notably, oral administration of compound 1 significantly reduced the blood glucose levels of diabetic mice with increasing insulin sensitivity. In addition, the dyslipidemia of diabetic mice was also significantly improved by compound 1 gavage. The histological experiments showed that compound 1 treatment significantly ameliorated the disordered hepatic and pancreatic architecture and increased the glycogen content in the liver tissues as well as improved the insulin secretion function of pancreas. Taken together, our results manifested that the natural product compound 1 was a highly specific PTP1B inhibitor, which could activate insulin signaling pathway and ameliorate hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in diabetic BKS db mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464373>High-fat diet in a mouse insulin-resistant model induces widespread rewiring of the phosphotyrosine signaling network.</a></h1><p>Obesity-associated type 2  and accompanying diseases have developed into a leading human health risk across industrialized and developing countries. The complex molecular underpinnings of how lipid overload and lipid metabolites lead to the deregulation of metabolic processes are incompletely understood. We assessed hepatic post-translational alterations in response to treatment of cells with saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids and the consumption of a high-fat diet by mice. These data revealed widespread  phosphorylation changes affecting a large number of enzymes involved in metabolic processes as well as canonical receptor-mediated signal transduction networks. Targeting two of the most prominently affected molecular features in our data, SRC-family kinase activity and elevated reactive oxygen species, significantly abrogated the effects of saturated fat exposure in vitro and high-fat diet in vivo. In summary, we present a comprehensive view of diet-induced alterations of  signaling networks, including proteins involved in fundamental metabolic pathways.© 2019 The Authors.

PTP 1B is the negative regulator of insulin signaling cascade, and its diminished activity results in abolishment of insulin resistance associated with T2DM. The present review focused on the seven years journey (2012-2018) of TZDs as PTP 1B inhibitors with the insight into the amendments in the structural framework of TZD scaffold in order to optimize/design potential PTP 1B inhibitors. We have investigated the synthesized molecules based on TZD scaffold with potential activity profile against PTP 1B. Based on the SAR studies, the combined essential pharmacophoric features of selective and potent TZDs have been mapped and presented herewith for further design and synthesis of novel inhibitors of PTP 1B. Compound 46 bearing TZD scaffold with N-methyl benzoic acid and 5-(3-methoxy-4-phenethoxy) benzylidene exhibited the most potent activity (IC50 1.1 µM). Imidazolidine-2,4-dione, isosteric analogue of TZD, substituted with 1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-5-(3-(2,4- dichlorobenzyloxy)benzylidene) (Compound 15) also endowed with very good PTP inhibitory activity profile (IC50 0.57 µM). It is noteworthy that Z-configuration is essential in structural framework around the double bond of arylidene for the designing of bi-dentate ligands with optimum activity.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p></html>
