Of these participants, 95% (227/238) reported an intake of 93% or more of the required number of capsules. The rates of BV did not differ between groups at 18-20 weeks' gestation (15% (19/123) in the probiotic group vs. 9% (10/115) in the placebo group, adjusted odds ratio 1.82, 95% confidence interval 0.64-5.19). There were also no differences between the groups in the proportion of women colonised with the probiotic strains, Escherichia coli, Group  streptococci or other vaginal microbiota. There were no differences in the alpha diversity or composition of the bacterial communities between or within the probiotic and placebo groups at 9-14 and 18-20 weeks' gestation.Oral  taken from early pregnancy did not modify the vaginal microbiota.The oral probiotic preparation used in this study does not prevent BV in pregnant women.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the protective mechanism of Lactobacillus plantarum C88 on chronic liver injury induced by mycotoxin remains unclear.In this study, the addition of L. plantarum C88 obviously ameliorated the increased contents of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total cholesterol and triglyceride, the diminish contents of total protein and albumin in serum of mice challenged with AFB. Simultaneously, L. plantarum C88 attenuated the inflammatory response via significantly reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in serum. Furthermore, L. plantarum C88 remarkably down-regulated the nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) signaling pathways by weakening the expression of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4, and inhibited NF-κ nuclear translocation through enhancing the expression of NF-κ inhibitor (Iκ). Neutralization experiments confirmed that L. plantarum C88 decreased the levels of some pro-inflammatory factors due to the suppression of the NF-κ signaling pathways. Besides, L. plantarum C88 decreased the levels of Bax and Caspase-3, elevated the level of Bcl-2, and reduced mRNA expressions of Fatty acid synthetase receptor (Fas), FAS-associated death domain (FADD), TNF receptor associated death domain (TRADD) and Caspase-8 in the liver.Probiotic L. plantarum C88 prevented AFB-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by modulating TLR2/NF-κ and TLR4/NF-κ pathways. The molecular mechanisms of L. plantarum C88 in ameliorating AFB-induced excessive apoptosis included regulating the mitochondrial pathway and cell death receptor pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31280506>Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease is Associated with Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection in Premenopausal Women Independent of Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Recently, studies have found that non-alcholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with bacterial infections. Attempts to identify risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are still underway.To examine a possible association between NAFLD and rUTIs among premenopausal women.In a case-control study, 1009 hospitalized premenopausal women with a UTI during a period of 3 years were retrospectively studied. A total of 186 subjects with rUTIs and 186 controls without a history of rUTIs were included in this study. Each participant had an abdominal ultrasonogram as part of the inclusion criteria. The two groups were compared in terms of risk factors for rUTIs, such as maternal history of rUTIs, use of contraceptives, frequency of sexual intercourse, metabolic syndrome, obesity, use of , serum levels of vitamin D, and NAFLD. An rUTI was defined as three or more episodes of UTI over a period of 1 year. NAFLD was diagnosed based on abdominal ultrasonography examination.Mean age of the 372 participants was 39.7 ± 5 years. NAFLD was diagnosed in 81/186 subjects (43.5%) with rUTIs vs. 40/186 controls (21.5%), P = 0.05. Women with rUTIs were more often obese and presented with lower serum levels of vitamin D than controls. Multivariate analysis showed that NAFLD (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-2.0, P = 0.04) were associated with rUTIs in premenopausal women.NAFLD was associated with rUTI in premenopausal women, independent of metabolic syndrome.

SIBO is often encountered in patients with cirrhosis as a result of impaired intestinal motility and delayed transit time, both of which are exacerbated by more severe liver disease. Additional risk factors for SIBO commonly encountered in cirrhotic patients include coexisting diabetes, autonomic neuropathy, and/or alcoholic use. Diagnosis of SIBO is performed by breath testing or jejunal aspiration, the gold standard. In cirrhotic patients, the presence of SIBO can lead to profound clinical consequences. Increased intestinal permeability in these patients predisposes to bacterial translocation into the systemic circulation. As a result, SIBO is implicated as a significant risk factor in the pathogenesis of both spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotics. Antibiotics, especially rifaximin, are the best studied and most effective treatment options for SIBO. However, prokinetics, , nonselective beta-blockers, and treatment of underlying liver-related pathophysiology with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement or liver transplantation are also being investigated. This review will discuss the risk factors, diagnosis, manifestations in cirrhosis, and treatment options of SIBO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30794334>Add-on  in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis: A randomized crossover clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Current medications for allergic rhinitis (AR) may have undesirable side effects that could affect quality of life (QoL).  could be an alternative in these patients. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of add-on  on symptoms and QoL of patients.In this randomized crossover clinical trial, patients with persistent AR were included. Each subject received budesonide with probiotic supplements (BP) or budesonide with placebo for 8 weeks (), then vice versa for a further 8 weeks. There was an 8-week washout. The primary outcome was the change of the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) score. The secondary outcomes were assessed by the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) and the Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test (CARAT) questionnaires.A total of 152 subjects (30.1 ± 7.6 years) completed the study. The SF-36 score in both groups showed improvement compared with baseline values. Treatment BP was more effective than that of . The Cohen's d and the number needed to treat for Physical Component Scales of SF-36 were 0.40 and 10.77, respectively. These values for Mental Component Scales were 0.33 and 12.61, respectively. Also, treatment BP showed more reduction in the score of SNOT-22 and CARAT.This study showed that the addition of  to budesonide significantly improved QoL in persistent AR patients. However, the clinical situation of these patients may be not very representative of AR patients in general population.

C. Ma. The monosaccharide composition analysis indicated that CDA-0.05 was composed of glucose and galactose in a molar ratio of 96.4: 3.6. The backbone of CDA-0.05 contained 1, 4-linked α-D-Glcp, 1, 4, 6-linked α-D-Glcp and 1, 4-linked β-D-Galp, with branches of T-linked α-D-Glcp attached at C-6 of 1, 4, 6-linked α-D-Glcp residues. Bioactivity test results suggested that CDA-0.05 could promote the growth of three species of Bacteroides (. thetaiotaomicron, . ovatus and . fragilis) significantly. Furthermore, CDA-0.05 could also promote some  growth, such as Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus reuteri.

A completely randomized 2 × 4 factorial design (2 levels of fiber; 4 types of supplements) with 8 replicate cages (6 birds/cage) was used. Each low and high-fiber diet contained 500 FTU/kg Buttiauxella sp. phytase and was supplemented with: (a) none (control), () XAP (2,000 U xylanase + 200 U amylase + 4,000 U protease/kg diet), (c)  (75,000 CFU/g of Bacillus spp.), or (d) XAP + . High fiber decreased (P < 0.05) nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn), AID of all amino acids (AA), AID and ATTD of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), starch, and gross energy (GE). High fiber increased (P < 0.01) the flow of total non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in both ileum and total tract. The XAP +  increased (P < 0.01) AMEn as well as AID and ATTD of DM, CP, GE, starch, while alone, XAP yielded similar improvement except for DM compared with control. The supplemental XAP alone improved (P < 0.01) the digestibility of most of the AAs compared with control. Moreover, XAP +  increased (P < 0.05) AID of all AA except arginine and serine compared with control. A fiber × supplements interaction (P < 0.05) was found for AID of histidine and threonine, and their digestibility in high-fiber diet was improved to a level comparable to low-fiber diet by XAP + . The flow of NSP in XAP group was 5 to 6% lower than in control while NSP flow in XAP + probiotic group was further 4% lower than that of XAP group (P < 0.01). The results infer that the combination of XAP and  can effectively optimize the nutrient digestibility in broilers fed both low and high-fiber diets.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880406>How  face food stress: They get by with a little help.</a></h2><p>The dietary consumption of  in the form of pharmaceuticals or functional food can improve human health and contribute to disease prevention.

Using a well-established model of progressive MS triggered by intracranial infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), we sought to determine whether dysbiosis induced by oral antibiotics (ABX) administered on pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of the disease influences its course. We also addressed the effects of microbiota recolonization after ABX withdrawn in the presence or absence of . Central and peripheral immunity, plasma acetate and butyrate levels, axon damage and motor disability were evaluated. The cocktail of ABX prevented motor dysfunction and limited axon damage in mice, which had fewer CD4 and CD8 T cells in the CNS, while gut microbiota recolonization worsened motor function and axonal integrity. The underlying mechanisms of ABX protective effects seem to involve CD4CD39 T cells and CD5CD1d  cells into the CNS. In addition, microglia adopted a round amoeboid morphology associated to an anti-inflammatory gene profile in the spinal cord of TMEV mice administered ABX. The immune changes in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were modest, yet ABX treatment of mice limited IL-17 production . Collectively, our results provide evidence of the functional relevance of gut microbiota manipulation on the neurodegenerative state and disease severity in a model of progressive MS and reinforce the role of gut microbiota as target for MS treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140604>Effects of dietary isomaltooligosaccharide and Bacillus spp. supplementation during perinatal period on lactational performance, blood metabolites, and milk composition of sows.</a></h2><p>In this study, we evaluated the effects of isomaltooligosaccharide (IMO) and Bacillus spp. in perinatal diets on lactational performance, blood metabolites, and milk composition of sows.

Many of the commercially used strains have not been tested in dogs and are incorporated only on the base of beneficial effects observed in humans with specific disorders. Moreover, no information on the effects of bacteriocin-producing strains in dogs is available. Therefore, we decided to test and to compare overall effect of bacteriocin non-producing Enterococcus faecium DSM 32820 and enterocin -producing E. faecium LMG 30881 strain (both of canine origin). Dogs were divided into three treatment groups of ten dogs each: control; DSM 32820 group; and LMG 30881 group, dosing 10 CFU/day/dog. The experiment lasted 35 days with a 14-day treatment period (sample collection at days 0, 7, 14, 35). Despite bacteriocin production is believed that may provide a competitive advantage over neighbouring sensitive strains within shared environment, results indicated somewhat better survival for the DSM 32820 compared to the LMG 30881 group. Furthermore, dogs of DSM 32820 group had optimal faecal consistency throughout the experiment, significantly stimulated phagocytic activity (days 7 and 14) and metabolic burst activity of leukocytes (days 14 and 35) and lower serum glucose concentration (day 35). In contrast, dogs of LMG 30881 group showed higher faecal count of Gram-negative bacteria (day 35), lower haemoglobin and glucose concentration (day 35), and higher metabolic burst activity (days 14 and 35).

This study aimed to prepare Bifidobacterium breve-loaded yogurt with the bacteria surviving transit to the lower part of small intestine or colon. Bifidobacterium breve beads were prepared through an ion-crosslinking method using low methoxyl pectin as the encapsulating material. Features such as encapsulation efficiency and stability during storage and passage through the simulated gastrointestinal tract were studied in vitro. A commercial starter was used for yogurt fermentation, and . breve with or without encapsulation was added as a probiotic supplement with the starter or 3 to 4 h after fermentation. The effects of . breve beads on yogurt characteristics were evaluated after different fermentation processes: BC, milk fermented with marketed yogurt starter; UBFF, unencapsulated . breve added to fresh milk and then fermented; EBFF, encapsulated . breve added to fresh milk and then fermented; UBAF, unencapsulated . breve added after fermentation with the starter; and EBAF, encapsulated . breve beads added 3 to 4 h after fermentation with the starter. Evaluation was based on texture, electronic nose, and electronic tongue analyses. The particle size analysis of . breve beads showed that they were uniform, mostly spherical, 1 to 1.5 mm in diameter with encapsulating efficiency higher than 99%. Following treatment with the simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, the number of . breve decreased by 1.76 and 4.82 log cfu/g for . breve beads and unencapsulated . breve, respectively. The EBAF group showed the lowest viscosity (2,235.67 cP) at d 0, and the lower postfermentation degree was reflected by the slow increase in yogurt viscosity. All groups kept a relatively stable pH during storage. The cohesiveness values of the EBAF and UBAF groups were significantly higher than those of the other groups. The trends in texture changes within the BC, UBFF, and EBFF groups were similar, and the UBAF and EBAF groups showed similar trends. In conclusion, . breve beads showed good stability in vitro and improved yogurt characteristics by increasing the survival rate of the encapsulated cells.

Group   (GBS) is a significant neonatal pathogen and maternal vaginal colonization has been recognized as an important risk factor for neonatal disease. Therefore, it is important to discover the relationship between the composition of the vaginal microbiome and GBS colonization. This study explores the potential relationship between the composition of the vaginal microbiome and GBS colonization in non-pregnant Chinese women.A total of 22 GBS-positive, non-pregnant women and 44 matched GBS-negative women were recruited for the current study. The composition of the vaginal microbiome was profiled by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes. The microbiome diversity and variation were then evaluated.The vaginal microbiome of the 66 subjects enrolled in the current study were compared and the results showed that GBS-positive women exhibited significant vaginal microbial differences compared with the GBS-negative women based on the analysis of similarities ( = 0.306,  < 0.01). The relative abundance of the bacterial genus  ( < 0.01) was significantly lower in the GBS-positive group, while the abundances of the bacterial genera  ( < 0.01),  ( < 0.01), and  ( < 0.01) were significantly higher in the GBS-positive group.The current study addressed significant variations across the communities of the vaginal microbiome in GBS-positive and GBS-negative women in a Chinese cohort, which paves the way for a larger cohort-based clinical validation study and the development of therapeutic  in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213556>Bifidobacterium dentium Fortifies the Intestinal Mucus Layer via Autophagy and Calcium Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>Much remains unknown about how the intestinal microbiome interfaces with the protective intestinal mucus layer.  species colonize the intestinal mucus layer and can modulate mucus production by goblet cells. However, select  strains can also degrade protective glycans on mucin proteins. We hypothesized that the human-derived species  would increase intestinal mucus synthesis and expulsion, without extensive degradation of mucin glycans.  data revealed that  lacked the enzymes necessary to extensively degrade mucin glycans.

We also identified that -secreted products, such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), stimulated autophagy-mediated calcium signaling and MUC2 release. This work illustrates that  is capable of enhancing the intestinal mucus layer and goblet cell function via upregulation of gene expression and autophagy signaling pathways, with a net increase in mucin production. Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered epithelium. In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the epithelium. Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with inflammation and colitis in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood. Using a combination of gnotobiotic mice and mucus-secreting cell lines, we have identified a human-derived microbe, , which adheres to intestinal mucus and secretes metabolites that upregulate the major mucin MUC2 and modulate goblet cell function. Unlike other  species,  does not extensively degrade mucin glycans and cannot grow on mucin alone. This work points to the potential of using  and similar mucin-friendly microbes as therapeutic agents for intestinal disorders with disruptions in the mucus barrier.Copyright © 2019 Engevik et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018530>The Anti-Rotaviral Activity of Low Molecular Weight and Non-Proteinaceous Substance from  BORI Cell Extract.</a></h2><p>Rotavirus infection is the most common diarrheal disease worldwide in children under five years of age, and it often results in death.

The present work investigated the anti-rotaviral effect of  BORI by cytopathic effect observation and real time cell analyses. Our study found that  BORI showed strong anti-rotaviral effect when incubated with MA104 cells prior to viral infection, suggesting that the probiotic does in fact interfere with the interaction of viruses and host cells. It is believed that the efficacy is due to low-molecular weight and non-protein components derived from  BORI.

The absorption and barrier function of the gut play a vital role in the maintenance of body homeostasis. This study was to investigate the protective effects of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SC06 (Ba) on HO-induced oxidative stress on intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-1) based on the level of gene expression. We demonstrated that Ba was a safe probiotic strain in the first place. Results showed that treatment with HO significantly increased the mRNA expression of absorptive transporters glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), Ala/Ser/Cys/Thr transporter 1 (ASCT1), and ASCT2 compared with the control group. Meanwhile, oxidative stress induced a significant improvement in the mRNA expression of occludin (OCLN) and caspase-3, and remarkably inhibited the expression of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) or  cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), respectively. Pretreatment with Ba dramatically reversed the disturbance induced by oxidative stress on the mRNA expression of ASCT1, ASCT2, and OCLN, which also significantly prevented HO-inhibited LAT1 and Bcl-2 mRNA expression. However, Ba failed to exert any significant protective effect on GLUT2 and caspase-3 mRNA expression. We concluded that pretreatment with Ba could alleviate the damage caused by oxidative stress to a certain extent and conferred a protective effect to the intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260157>Novel bifidobacteria strains isolated from nonconventional sources.

Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 and INL1 were used as reference strains. The results obtained demonstrated that the new isolates presented strain-dependent behaviour. Good results were obtained for thermal resistance, frozen storage at -80°C and lyophilized powders maintained at 5°C. Cell viability during refrigerated storage was higher when the strains were resuspended in milk at pH 5·0 than at 4·5. The surface hydrophobicity ranged between 7 and 98% depending on the strain. The simulated gastric resistance was improved for the strains incorporated in cheese. Regarding antimicrobial activity, bifidobacteria isolated from monkey presented higher inhibitory capacity than the reference strains.This research provides a deeper insight into new strains of bifidobacteria isolated from primates and chicken that have not been previously characterized for their potential use in dairy products and confirm the most robust stress tolerance of . lactis.The possibility of expanding the available bifidobacteria with the potential to be added to a probiotic food necessarily implies characterizing them from different points of view, especially when considering unknown species. For monkey isolates (which showed higher antimicrobial activity against pathogens), more in-depth knowledge is needed before applying strategies to improve their performance.

Recently, we have constructed a bioactive  (LC) strain, LC, by inserting  (myosin cross-reactive antigen) gene, which stimulates the conversion of conjugated linoleic acids. In this study, we evaluated the modulation of gut microbiome and protective roles of LC against pathogenic  serovar Typhimurium (ST) and enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) infections in BALB/cJ mice. We observed that LC colonized efficiently in mice gut intestine and competitively reduced the infection with ST and EHEC in various locations of small and large intestine, specifically cecum, jejunum, and ileum ( < 0.05). Positive modulation of the cecal microbiota, for example, higher relative abundances of Firmicutes, lower relative abundances of Proteobacteria, and increased bacterial species diversity/richness, was detected in ST-challenged mice pretreated with LC based on 16S metagenomic sequencing. Cytokine gene expression analysis indicated that mice pretreated with LC associated with attenuated bacterial pathogen-induced gut inflammation. Furthermore, mice fed daily with LC for one week could protect themselves from the impairments caused by enteric infections with ST or EHEC. These impairments include weight loss, negative hematological changes, intestinal histological alterations, and potential death.

In frequent tonsillitis, the pharmacological approach is no longer effective, and, therefore, surgery becomes the treatment of choice.  This study compares the prophylactic efficacy of Streptococcus salivarius K12 (Bactoblis) in children with recurrent pharyngo-tonsillitis treated vs untreated, with a 12 -month follow-up. The primary objectives are: The incidence of recurrence of pharyngo-tonsillar episodes and the concomitant use of other drugs. Secondary objectives are: tolerability of the treatment, the effectiveness in terms of clinical improvement, days of absence from school, reduction of the use of standard therapies, and cancellation from the surgical planning list.  Patients belonging to group A (treated with K12 for 90 days) were 24 males and 26 females, mean age 6.6 years (SD=1.57), those belonging to group  (untreated) were 23 males and 27 females, average age 6.8 years (SD=1.72). In the follow-up, group A reported 26 inflammatory pharyngo-tonsillary episodes in the first trimester, unlike group , who reported 72 in the second trimester. This has shown a lower incidence (3.38%) of the disease compared to group  (6.66%), for a total of 169 inflammatory pharyngo-tonsillary episodes in group A against 333 in group .

One  genotype vancomycin resistant  strain, E4, and one chloramphenicol-resistant  strain, E2, were isolated from twenty-nine probiotic basis feed material / additive samples. For  conjugation, E4 and E2 were used as starter to ferment soybean meal. For  conjugation, thirty growing pigs were randomly assigned to five groups ( = 6), treated with a basic diet, or supplemented with 10% fermented soybean meal, 1% E4, 5% E2 or a combination of 1% E4 + 5% E2 for 7 d, respectively. Fecal samples of pigs in each group were collected daily for the isolation and dynamic analysis of E4, E2 and transconjugants. The sequence types (STs) of E4, E2 and transconjugants were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The  harboring plasmid in E4 and transconjugants was analyzed by S1-pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and further verified by multiple alignments.The results showed that, in FSBM, transconjugants were detected 1 h after the fermentation, with a conjugation frequency of ~ 10 transconjugants / recipient. Transconjugants proliferated with E4 and E2 in the first 8 h and maintained steadily for 10 d till the end of the experiment. Additionally,  experiment showed that transcojugants were recovered in one of six pigs in both FSBM and E4 + E2 groups, with conjugation frequency of ~ 10 and ~ 10, respectively.

In this study, we have isolated a new strain L. paracasei subsp. paracasei IBB3423 from samples of raw cow milk collected in a citizen science project. IBB3423 showed some desired probiotic features such as high adhesion capacity and ability to metabolize inulin. Its complete genome sequence comprising the chromosome of 3,183,386 bp and two plasmids of 5986 bp and 51,211 bp was determined. In silico analysis revealed numerous genes encoding proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and of extracellular localization likely supporting interaction with host tissues. In vitro tests confirmed the high adhesion capacity of IBB3423 and showed that it even exceeds that of the highly adhesive L. rhamnosus GG. Curing of the larger plasmid indicated that the adhesive properties depend on the plasmid and thus could be determined by its pilus-encoding spaCBA genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088293>Recombinant invasive  expressing fibronectin binding protein A induce specific humoral immune response by stimulating differentiation of dendritic cells.</a></h2><p>Recombinant lactic acid bacteria (LAB), especially , have been genetically engineered to express heterogeneous invasion proteins, such as the fibronectin binding protein A (FnBPA) from , to increase the invasion ability of the host strains, indicating a promising approach for DNA vaccine delivery. The presence of FnBPA has been also shown to be an adjuvant for co-delivered antigens, however, the underlying mechanisms are still not clear. To explore the above underlying mechanisms, in this study, we constructed a novel  strain with surface displayed FnBPA, which could significantly improve the adhesion and invasion ratios of  strain on a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) about two-fold compared with the empty vector. At the same time, the presence of FnBPA significantly stimulated the differentiation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and increased the secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 and mRNA level of IL-6 gene, which were proved by flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). With regard to  study, the presence of FnBPA significantly stimulated the differentiation of DCs in the Peyer's patch (PP) and the percentages of IL-4 and IL-17A T helper (Th) cells of splenocytes in flow cytometry assay. In consistent with these results, the levels of IL-4 and IL-17A in serum as measured via ELISA also increased in mice treated with FnBPA . Finally, the FnBPA strain increased the production of B220  cells in mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and PP and the levels of FnBPA-specific IgG and sIgA antibodies, indicating the its possible application in vaccine field. This study demonstrated that the invasive  with surface displayed FnBPA could modulate host immune response by stimulating the differentiation of DCs and Th cells which could possibly be responsive for the adjuvant effects of FnBPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31416116>Paraimmunobiotic Bifidobacteria Modulate the Expression Patterns of Peptidoglycan Recognition Proteins in Porcine Intestinal Epitheliocytes and Antigen Presenting Cells.</a></h2><p>Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGLYRPs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are able to induce innate immune responses through their binding to peptidoglycan (PGN), lipopolysaccharide, or lipoteichoic acid, or by interacting with other PRR-ligands. Recently, progress has been made in understanding the immunobiology of PGLYRPs in human and mice, however, their functions in livestock animals have been less explored. In this study, we characterized the expression patterns of PGLYRPs in porcine intestinal epithelial (PIE) cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and their modulation by the interactions of host cells with PRR-ligands and non-viable immunomodulatory  referred to as paraimmunobiotics. We demonstrated that PGLYRP-1, -2, -3, and -4 are expressed in PIE cells and APCs from Peyer's patches, being PGLYPR-3 and -4 levels higher than PGLYRP-1 and -2. We also showed that PGLYRPs expression in APCs and PIE cells can be modulated by different PRR agonists. By using knockdown PIE cells for TLR2, TLR4, NOD1, and NOD2, or the four PGLYRPs, we demonstrated that PGLYRPs expressions would be required for activation and functioning of TLR2, TLR4, NOD1, and NOD2 in porcine epitheliocytes, but PGLYRPs activation would be independent of those PRR expressions. Importantly, we reported for the first time that PGLYRPs expression can be differentially modulated by paraimmunobiotic bifidobacteria in a strain-dependent manner. These results provide evidence for the use of paraimmunobiotic bifidobacteria as an alternative for the improvement of resistance to intestinal infections or as therapeutic tools for the reduction of the severity of inflammatory damage in diseases in which a role of PGLYRPs-microbe interaction has been demonstrated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269823>Experimental and investigational drugs for the treatment of acute otitis media.</a></h2><p>: Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common disease, particularly in infants and young children. Almost all children experience at least one episode of AOM in the first 3 years of age, and approximately 50% experience recurrent episodes in the same period of time. : Some new potentially effective preventive or therapeutic approaches to AOM have been identified and are not discussed even in the most updated guidelines. The main aim of this narrative review is to detail what has been recently suggested. : Several new measures have been suggested to reduce systemic antibiotic abuse in AOM therapy and prophylaxis. For therapy, the administration of preparations containing antibiotics, bacteriophages or peptides can allow trans-tympanic passage of effective anti-otopathogen measures and the use of vaccines or immunoglobulins can disrupt biofilm. For AOM prophylaxis, new vaccines and the use of  by nasal spray are in development. However, further advances in the selection of children for whom antimicrobial therapy and/or prophylaxis measures are truly needed could be derived from studies that analyse the association between genetic characteristics of the host and development of AOM with specific characteristics of aetiology or tendency to recur.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231490>Effects of Lactobacillus  and   on the serum biochemical parameters, and the vitamin D and leptin receptor genes on mice colon cancer.</a></h2><p>The preclinical reports have shown that specific  like  () and  () can be applied as the biotherapeutic agents in the inhibition or therapy of colorectal cancer via the modification of gut bacteria.

During lyophilization and subsequent storage in the gastrointestinal tract, bacteria are exposed to stress conditions that can lead to impairment and loss of viability.  The suitability of various excipients for enhancing the stability and functionality of  subsp.  during storage as freeze-dried powder and through exposure to acid and bile was investigated. Cells were lyophilized in the presence of sucrose, trehalose, lactose, cellobiose and fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and stored at 4 °C or 25 °C. The effect of diverse protectants on the persistence after exposure to acid and bile environment was examined through determination of the colony forming units, the β-glucosidase and β-galactosidase activity and the membrane integrity changes.  Cells freeze-dried in the presence of cryoprotectants had comparable survivability during storage at 4 °C whereas the survival rate at 25 °C of cells protected by cellobiose and FOS was higher than for those protected with sucrose and trehalose. Furthermore, the respective excipients used as cryoprotectants enhanced the stability of cells exposed to simulated gastric and small intestinal medium. Stabilization may be achieved through different mechanism of action such as protecting the membrane integrity and as metabolizable substrates. Overall, prebiotic and thus metabolizable protectants including cellobiose and FOS were superior to other protectants used.  In symbiotic formulas with  these sugars might serve as prebiotics and stabilizers of this probiotic strain during lyophilization, storage and in gastrointestinal conditions simultaneously, potentially increasing its health-promoting effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515596>Protective effects of Lactobacillus plantarum against chronic alcohol-induced liver injury in the murine model.</a></h2><p>Long-term alcohol consumption causes liver injuries such as alcoholic hepatitis, fatty liver, and endotoxemia. Some  were demonstrated to exert beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract. The present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effects of Lactobacillus plantarum CMU995 against alcohol-induced liver injury. The mice were orally administered L. plantarum CMU995 for 1 week, followed by the administration of alcohol and different tested substances daily for 6 weeks. The liver injury was examined by measuring the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA), anti-oxidative enzyme, endotoxin, inflammatory cytokines, and lipid accumulation in the liver or serum among different groups. L. plantarum CMU995 exhibited beneficial effects on alcohol-induced liver injury via reduction in the serum concentration of AST, ALT, cholesterol, triglycerides, endotoxin, TNF-α, IL-1β, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we also found that the levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and intestinal tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were considerably higher in L. plantarum CMU995-fed groups when compared with placebo group. Meanwhile, the protective effects were demonstrated biological gradients as controversial dose-dependent. We speculate that L. plantarum CMU995 inhibited the migration of alcohol-derived endotoxin into the blood and liver, thereby improving the intestinal barrier. The present evidence may provide a novel microbiota-based strategy to prevent the alcohol-induced liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30795775>Nutraceutical approach for the management of cardiovascular risk - a combination containing the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum BB536 and red yeast rice extract: results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.</a></h2><p> incorporated into dairy products have been shown to reduce total (TC) and LDL cholesterolemia (LDL-C) in subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia. More specifically,  with high biliary salt hydrolase activity, e.g. Bifidobacterium longum BB536, may decrease TC and LDL-C by lowering intestinal cholesterol reabsorption and, combined with other nutraceuticals, may be useful to manage hypercholesterolemia in subjects with low cardiovascular (CV) risk. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a nutraceutical combination containing Bifidobacterium longum BB536, red yeast rice (RYR) extract (10 mg/day monacolin K), niacin, coenzyme Q10 (Lactoflorene Colesterolo®).

In this study, the simultaneous production of lactic acid (LA) and livestock feed on a combined substrate based on molasses and potato stillage by Lactobacillus paracasei NRRL -4564 immobilized onto sunflower seed hull (SSH), brewer's spent grain (BSG) and sugar beet pulp (SBP) was studied.The highest total LA concentration of 399 g L with overall productivity of 1.27 g L  h was achieved in repeated batch fermentation by SBP-immobilized biocatalyst, followed by BSG- and SSH-immobilized cells. Fermentation improved the content of proteins and ash, and decreased the content of fibers in all three support materials. In addition, the fermentation had favorable effect on in vitro dry matter digestibility and energy values of SSH and BSG. According to assessment of probiotic potential, L. paracasei demonstrated a favorable probiotic profile, exhibiting high resistance to simulated ruminant digestive tract and significant antioxidant and antimicrobial activity.The proposed strategy enables valorization of agro-industrial residues as value-added ruminant feed and simultaneous LA production.

This trial was considered to evaluate the potential effects of in ovo administration of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium longum on growth performance and biochemical parameters of broilers. Three hundred broiler breeder eggs were incubated and candled individually at day 17 of embryogenesis; then, eggs that had live embryos were randomly divided into six groups. The first and second groups were of intact (without injection) and vehicle-injected (sterile distilled water) control groups, respectively. Other groups were in ovo injected with 1 × 10 and 1 × 10 CFU . bifidum, and 1 × 10 and 1 × 10 CFU . longum, respectively. Hatchability was significantly (P < 0.001) affected by in ovo inoculation of bifidobacteria strains. Body weight gain and feed conversion ratio were significantly improved (P = 0.014 and 0.019, respectively) in all treatment groups. Protein fractions, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase activities were not significantly altered by bifidobacteria strains in ovo injection.

Recently,  strains with high adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells were associated with induction of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells in humans and rodents. Here, two  strains with similar adhesive ability but different aggregation properties were investigated for specific immunoregulatory effects, including the underlying cellular pathway, on macrophage and T-regulatory (Treg)/Th17 axis activation in vitro and in the colon of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-colitis mice in vivo. In-vitro, the auto-aggregative .  strain IF1-11 induced significantly higher IL-6 and lower IL-10 secretion from immune cells, and it induced abundant Th17 cells. The non-aggregating strain IF1-03 induced significantly higher IL-10, less IL-6 and a high proportion of Treg/Th17 cells compared to total T cells. In vivo, orally administered IF1-03 protected DSS-colitis mice via activation of dendritic cells or macrophages and skewing of Treg/Th17 cells, consistent with Treg cell induction in vitro. IF1-03 exopolysaccharides showed a functional recognition pattern similar to IF1-03 for IL-10 cytokine secretion and Treg cell-differentiation induction, both dependent on the toll-like receptor 2-ERK/p38 MAPK-signaling cascade for macrophage activation.

The animals were allotted to four treatment groups in a randomized complete block design involving a 2 (protein levels) × 2 (probiotic levels) factorial arrangement of treatments. Two protein levels included the high CP (HP) diets (0 to 14 d, 20.5%; 15 to 42 d, 19.5%) and the low CP (LP) diets (0 to 14 d, 18%; 15 to 42 d, 17%), and added probiotic (PRO) levels included at 0 and 500 mg/kg diet. Two interactions between CP and PRO for ADG (P < 0.01) and F/G (P < 0.05) were observed in phase 1. Within the piglets given the LP diet, probiotic supplementation increased ADG and decreased F/G ratio. Likewise, there were interactions between CP and PRO on the digestibility of CP (P < 0.01) and EE (P < 0.05), and probiotic supplementation increased the digestibility of CP and ether extract (EE) of piglets fed with LP diet, but that was not the case for piglets fed with HP diet. Furthermore, there were interactions between CP and PRO on villus height (P < 0.01) and villus height:crypt depth ratio (P < 0.05) in ileum. Piglets fed with LP diet containing probiotic had the greatest villus height and villus height:crypt depth ratio in ileum among treatments. There were also main effects of PRO on the propionic acid (P < 0.05) and butyric acid (P < 0.05), and the concentrations of propionic acid and butyric acid in colonic digesta were increased with the inclusion of probiotic in diet. Piglets fed with LP diet containing probiotic had the greatest population of Bacillus and Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05) in colon. In addition, there were interactions between CP and PRO on the mRNA expressions of occludin-1 (P < 0.05), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (P < 0.05), and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) (P < 0.05). The LP fed piglets plus probiotic exhibited the greatest mRNA expressions of occludin-1, EGF, and IGF-1R in ileum compared with other treatments. In conclusion, moderate dietary protein restriction combining with the addition of . subtilis DSM32315 synergistically increased growth performance, altered hindgut bacterial composition and metabolites, maintained intestinal barrier function in ileum of piglets.© The Author(s) 2019.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of probiotic biotherapy with combination of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 on the expression levels of proteins critical to neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-exposed rats. Four groups of animals (Control, LPS, Probiotic + LPS, and Probiotic) were treated with maltodextrin (placebo) or probiotic (10 CFU/ml/rat) for 2 weeks by gavage. On the 15th day, a single intraperitoneal dose of saline or LPS (1 mg/kg) was injected and 4 h later, protein assessment was performed by western blotting in hippocampal tissues. LPS significantly increased the Bax, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and cleaved caspase-3 expression along with decreased the Bcl-2 and procaspase-3 protein levels. However, probiotic pretreatment (L. helveticus R0052 + . longum R0175) significantly downregulated the Bax and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio accompanied with upregulated Bcl-2 expression. Prophylactic treatment with these bacteria also attenuated LPS-induced caspase-3 activation by remarkably increasing the expression of procaspase-3 while reducing the level of cleaved caspase-3 in target tissues.

ACE2 has been shown to be protective in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases including diabetes and its complications.

We show that codon-optimized ACE2 can be efficiently expressed in LP. Mice treated with the recombinant LP expressing the secreted ACE2 in fusion with the non-toxic subunit  of cholera toxin, which acts as a carrier to facilitate transmucosal transport, showed increased ACE2 activities in serum and tissues. ACE2-LP administration reduced the number of acellular capillaries, blocked retinal ganglion cell loss, and decreased retinal inflammatory cytokine expression in two mouse models of diabetic retinopathy.

The obtained results showed that the incorporation of the probiotic strain can inhibit the proliferation of spoilage microorganisms, such Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp., delay the lipid oxidation, improve texture parameters, and extend the shelf life of these products during storage. We also examined the correlations between protein and lipid oxidation, texture profile and color parameters of raw minced beef meat inoculated with L. plantarum TN8. The incorporation of strain at 10 CFU/g resulted in better quality inclusive color, lipid oxidative stability, and texture parameters notably cohesiveness, adhesiveness, hardness and chewiness. Overall, the findings demonstrated that TN8 can be used as a biopreservative agent for extending the safety and quality of refrigerated raw minced beef meat.Copyright © 2019.

On the basis of feeding with immunostimulant diets, the fish were assigned into eight groups denoted as: control (basal diet), β (basal diet + β-glucan), bM (basal diet + MOS), bLp (basal diet + L. plantarum), βLp (basal diet + β-glucan + L. plantarum), bMLp (basal diet + MOS + L. plantarum), bMβ (basal diet + MOS + β-glucan), and bMβLp (basal diet + MOS + β-glucan + L. plantarum). All of the immunostimulant diets, in general, reduced feed intake (FI) and food conversion ratio (FCR) and increased WG, PER, and final weight. Condition factor (CF) demonstrated the lowest level in the experimental group received bMβLp. Total lipid increased in the fish received the additives, especially bM and bMβ. Ash content demonstrated significant increase in the fish fed on β and bMβLp, whereas moisture content was reduced in the group fed with L. plantarum-supplemented diet. All immunostimulant diets enhanced the activity and levels of lysozyme, Immunoglobulin M (IgM), and serum alternative complement activity (ACH50); the highest value for these indices was observed in the groups fed with bMβ, bMβLp, and βLp. bMβ-treated fish group displayed the highest cortisol and glucose levels. bM diet induced the highest mRNA transcription of TNF-α1 in head kidney, whereas bLp, bMβ, and bMβLp showed no effect. IL1β exhibited the greatest up-regulation, about 8.75 fold change, in response to the diet supplemented only with β-glucan. βLp and β significantly enhanced the relative IL-8 mRNA expression in the head kidney (about 2.75 and 1.9 folds, respectively), yet in response to bMβLp treatment it showed a decrease of about 5.7 times lower than the control group. In addition, intestinal population of L. plantarum showed the highest loads in the groups fed on the diets which were treated with the probiotic. Taken together, combinational use of these immunostimulants enhanced humoral innate immune system, whereas their individual and combinational application could increase and decrease the transcription of inflammation-related genes, respectively.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Some beneficial microorganisms (or ) such as lactic acid bacteria have shown the ability to reduce the bioavailability of aflatoxins and its intestinal absorption. However, the dose and duration of aflatoxins exposure and probiotic treatment can influence the ability of  to remove aflatoxins. Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the efficacy of oral probiotic  Shirota strain (LcS) induction in an acute exposure to AFB in rats. Experimentally, Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups: AFB only (n = 9); AFB treated with LcS (n = 9); and control (no AFB exposure) (n = 6) groups. The blood AFB level of rats treated with LcS was slightly lower than the untreated AFB induced rats (11.12 ± 0.71 vs 10.93 ± 0.69 ng g). Also, LcS treatment slightly moderated the liver and kidney biomarkers in AFB induced rats. However, a trend for a significant difference was only observed in ALT of AFB induced rats treated with LcS compared to their counterparts (126.11 ± 36.90 vs 157.36 ± 15.46,  = 0.06). Rats' body weight decreased in all animals force-fed with AFB with no significant difference between LcS treatment compared to the counterpart. In conclusion, this experiment indicated that probiotic LsC was able to slightly ameliorate the adverse effect of an acute exposure to AFB in rats.

This fact is attended by physical and emotional distress and an economic load. The majority of chronic wounds are infected of harmful microbials in a protecting extracellular matrix. These biofilms inhibit wound healing. Biofilm-growing bacteria developed unique survival properties, which still challenge the appropriate wound therapy. The present in-vitro biofilm models are not suitable for translational research. By means of a novel in-vivo like human plasma biofilm model (hpBIOM), this study systematically analysed the influence of 3  on the survival of five clinically relevant pathogenic microorganisms.Human plasma was used to produce the innovate biofilm. Pathogenic microorganisms were administered to the plasma. By stimulating the production of a fibrin scaffold, stable coagula-like discs with integrated pathogens were produced. The five clinically relevant pathogens P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecium and C. albicans were challenged to the  L. plantarum, . lactis and S. cerevisiae. The  were administered on top of the biofilm and the survival was quantified after 4 h and 24 h of incubation. For statistics, two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's HSD test was applied.

Synbiotic, which is a two-point approach carrying probiotic and prebiotic components in mitigating inflammation in IBD, is thought to be a pragmatic approach owing to the synergistic outcomes. In this study, the impacts of dietary supplementation with probiotic  MTCC5856 spores () and prebiotic whole plant sugar cane fibre (PSCF) was assessed using a murine model of IBD. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal chow diet supplemented with either , PSCF or its synbiotic combination. After seven days of supplementation, colitis was induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for seven days during the continuation of the supplemented diets. Synbiotic supplementation ameliorated disease activity index and histological score (-72%, 7.38, respectively), more effectively than either  (-47%, 10.1) and PSCF (-53%, 13.0) alone. Synbiotic supplementation also significantly ( < 0.0001) prevented the expression of tight junction proteins and modulated the altered serum IL-1β (-40%), IL-10 (+26%), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (-39%) levels. Synbiotic supplementations also raised the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) profile more extensively compared to the unsupplemented DSS-control. The synbiotic health outcome effect of the probiotic and prebiotic combinations may be associated with a synergistic direct immune-regulating efficacy of the components, their ability to protect epithelial integrity, stimulation of probiotic spores by the prebiotic fibre, and/or with stimulation of greater levels of fermentation of fibres releasing SCFAs that mediate the reduction in colonic inflammation. Our model findings suggest synbiotic supplementation should be tested in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30849499>Bacillus pumilus SE5 originated PG and LTA tuned the intestinal TLRs/MyD88 signaling and microbiota in grouper (Epinephelus coioides).</a></h2><p>The normal microbiota plays a key role in the health of host, but little is known of how the fish immune system recognizes and responds to indigenous bacteria/. Our previous studies have showed that heat-inactivated indigenous Bacillus pumilus SE5 activate the TLR2 signaling pathways and modulate the intestinal microbiota in grouper (Epinephelus coioides), suggesting microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) involved. In this study, whole cell wall (CW) and two possible MAMPs, peptidoglycan (PG) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) have been extracted from . pumilus SE5 and their effects on intestinal immune related genes expression and microbiota were evaluated in a 60 days feeding trial. Significantly elevated expression of TLR1, TLR2, TLR5 and MyD88 was observed in fish fed the CW, PG and LTA containing diets, and the highest expression was observed in groups PG and LTA. At the same time, significantly upregulated expression of antimicrobial effectors, such as antimicrobial peptides (epinecidin-1, hepcidin-1 and β-defensin), C-type Lectin and IgM was observed in fish fed PG and LTA containing diets. This induced activation of intestinal immunity was consistent with the microbiota data showing that CW, PG and LTA originated from SE5 modulated the overall structure of intestinal microbiota, and the relative abundance of potentially pathogenic Vibrio decreased significantly while beneficial Lactobacillus increased significantly in fish fed PG and LTA. In conclusion, both the PG and LTA originated from . pumilus SE5 could activate TLRs/MyD88 signaling and expression of wide-ranging antibacterial effectors, and therefore shape the intestinal microbiota in grouper.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to study the surface morphology and identify metal oxides formed on the surface of the alloys. Experiments demonstrated that the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus reuteri can induce processes that alter some features of the surface such as roughness and chemical composition. The effect is dependent on the type of alloy and coating. The bacteria increased roughness in the case of uncoated NiTi more than saliva alone (pH = 4.8). Probiotic bacteria tend to decrease the corrosive influence of saliva on NiTi when the alloy is coated with rhodium or titanium nitride and this effect was also evidenced on SS.

Thirty-six weaned piglets were fed a basal diet, a diet supplemented with colistin sulphate antibiotic, or a diet supplemented with  including Clostridium butyricum, Bacillus subtilis, and . licheniformis.  significantly increased the feed : gain ratio, improved the average day gain from day 1 to day 28, and decreased the diarrhoea index.  also lowered the serum concentrations of AST, ALT, and ALP on day 14 and lowered the serum concentration of ALT on day 28 compared with the control. Probiotic supplementation caused fewer ileal apoptotic cells. The serum and ileal concentrations of TNF-α and IL-1β on day 28 were significantly lowered, and the serum concentrations of IL-6 were significantly lowered on days 14 and 28. Probiotic-fed piglets exhibited higher contents of hypothalamic serotonin and dopamine as well as serum γ-aminobutyric acid along with higher colonic concentrations of butyrate and valerate on day 28. High-throughput sequencing showed 972 core operational taxonomic units among all groups, of which 48 were unique to the probiotic-treated group. The relative abundance of genus Bacillus and species Bacillus velezensis was enriched in probiotic piglets; the phylogenetic investigation of communities by the reconstruction of unobserved states indicated that amino acid metabolism, DNA repair, replication and recombination proteins, and secretion systems were enriched with . In conclusion, the Clostridium butyricum-based  improved growth performance, enhanced intestinal morphology, changed hypothalamic neurotransmitters and modulated colonic microflora in weaned piglets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035365>Efficacy and Long-Term Safety of  Eradication for Gastric Cancer Prevention.</a></h2><p> has been shown to be a causal factor of gastric cancer in cohort studies and animal models. Meta-analysis of case-control studies nested within prospective cohorts showed that  infection was associated with a 5.9-fold increased risk of non-cardia gastric cancer. Prospective cohort studies showed that gastric cancer developed in 1-4% of infected subjects. Gastric cancer was successfully induced in Mongolian gerbils and insulin-gastrin (INS-GAS) transgenic mice after inoculation of . Meta-analysis of randomized control trials also showed that eradication of  may reduce the risk of gastric cancer. However, there are several concerns regarding the widespread use of antibiotics to prevent gastric cancer, including the emergence of antibiotic resistance and the perturbation of gut microbiota after  eradication. Recent studies showed that eradication of  resulted in an increase in the bacterial diversity and restoration of the relative abundance of other bacteria to levels similar to  non-infected subjects in the gastric microbiota. The administration of antibiotics may also alter the composition of intestinal microbiota. The α-diversity and β-diversity of fecal microbiota are significantly altered immediately after  eradication but are gradually restored to levels similar to those before therapy. Yet, the rate of recovery varies with regimens. The diversity was restored at week 8 after triple therapy but was not yet fully recovered at 1 year after concomitant and quadruple therapies. Some studies showed that supplementation of  may reduce the dysbiosis during  eradication therapy. Although some earlier studies showed high levels of macrolide resistance after triple therapy, recent studies showed that the increased antibiotic resistance rate may be restored 2-12 months after eradication therapy. These results collectively provide evidence of the long-term safety of  eradication. Yet, more prospective cohort studies and randomized trials are warranted to assess the efficacy and long-term safety of  eradication for gastric cancer prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061734>Intestinal Permeability Measured by Urinary Sucrose Excretion Correlates with Serum Zonulin and Faecal Calprotectin Concentrations in UC Patients in Remission.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with an increased intestinal permeability, possibly through a dysbiosis of intestinal bacteria. We investigated which markers are most relevant to assess intestinal permeability in UC patients and whether  had an effect on these markers.In this twelve-week placebo-controlled randomized double-blind study, twenty-five subjects with UC in remission received either placebo or a multispecies . Samples of blood, urine, and faeces were taken at baseline, week 6, and week 12 to assess intestinal permeability and inflammation. Diaries and Bristol stool scale were kept to record stool frequency and consistency. Quality of life was scored from 32-224 with the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBD-Q).This group of UC patients, in clinical remission, did not show increased intestinal permeability at baseline of this study. During the study, no significant group or time effects were found for intestinal permeability measured by the 5-sugar absorption test, serum zonulin, and faecal zonulin. Likewise, the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), calprotectin, and the cytokines IFN, TNF, IL-6, and IL-10 were not significantly affected. Stool frequency and consistency were not significantly affected either. The IBD-Q score, 194 for the  group and 195 for the placebo group, remained unaffected. Correlations were tested between all outcomes; urinary sucrose excretion was significantly correlated with serum zonulin ( = 0.62) and faecal calprotectin ( = 0.55). Faecal zonulin was not significantly correlated with any of the other markers.Serum zonulin may be a more relevant biomarker of intestinal permeability than faecal zonulin, due to its correlation with other biomarkers of intestinal permeability. UC patients in remission did not show an effect of the probiotic treatment or a change in gut permeability. This should not discourage further studies because effects might be present during active disease or shortly after a flare up.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649546>Inflammation in Renal Diseases: New and Old Players.</a></h2><p>Inflammation, a process intimately linked to renal disease, can be defined as a complex network of interactions between renal parenchymal cells and resident immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, coupled with recruitment of circulating monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate immunity pathways such as nuclear factor ĸ (NF-ĸ) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut microbiota can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut microbiota and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut microbiota through the administration of , prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸ inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric acid production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484413>Urolithin Metabotypes can Anticipate the Different Restoration of the Gut Microbiota and Anthropometric Profiles during the First Year Postpartum.</a></h2><p>The metabolism of dietary polyphenols ellagitannins by the gut-microbiota allows the human stratification in urolithin metabotypes depending on the final urolithins produced. Metabotype-A only produces urolithin-A, metabotype- yields urolithin- and isourolithin-A in addition to urolithin-A, and metabotype 0 does not produce urolithins. Metabotype-A has been suggested to be 'protective', and metabotype- dysbiotic-prone to cardiometabolic impairments. We analyzed the gut-microbiome of 40 healthy women and determined their metabotypes and enterotypes, and their associations with anthropometric and gut-microbial changes after 3 weeks, 4, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Metabotype-A was predominant in mothers who lost weight (≥2 kg) (75%) versus metabotype- (54%). After delivery, the microbiota of metabotype-A mothers changed, unlike metabotype-, which barely changed over 1 year. The metabotype-A discriminating bacteria correlated to the decrease of the women's waist while some metabotype- bacteria were inversely associated with a reduction of body mass index (BMI), waist, and waist-to-hip ratio. Metabotype- was associated with a more robust and less modulating microbial and anthropometric profiles versus metabotype-A, in which these profiles were normalized through the 1-year follow-up postpartum. Consequently, urolithin metabotypes assessment could be a tool to anticipate the predisposition of women to normalize their anthropometric values and gut-microbiota, significantly altered during pregnancy and after childbirth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30928918>Impact of bacterial  on obesity, diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease related variables: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.</a></h2><p>To systematically review the effect of oral intake of bacterial  on 15 variables related to obesity, diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Systematic review and meta-analysis.Medline, EMBASE and COCHRANE from 1990 to June 2018.Randomised controlled trials (≥14 days) excluding hypercholesterolaemia, alcoholic liver disease, polycystic ovary syndrome and children <3 years.One hundred and five articles met inclusion criteria, representing 6826 subjects.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and effects of the consumption of a milk formula during the first year of life that is supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263, two strains originally isolated from breast milk.A randomized, double blind, controlled, parallel group study including healthy, formula-fed infants was conducted. Two hundred and thirty-six 1-month-old infants were selected and randomly divided into three study groups according to a randomization list. Infants in the control group received a standard powdered infant formula until 12 months of age. Infants in the probiotic groups received the same infant formula but supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or . breve CECT7263. Main outcome was weigh-gain of infants as safety marker.One hundred and eighty-nine infants completed the eleven months of intervention (61 in control group, 65 in Lf group and 63 in Bb group). The growth of infants in the three groups was consistent with standards.

Experimental treatments included a basal diet (control); the basal diet supplemented with 1.0 × 10. licheniformis yb-214245; the basal diet supplemented with 1.0 × 10. subtilis yb-114246; a combination of both strains in a 2:1 ratio (6.6 × 10:3.3 × 10. licheniformis yb-214245:. subtilis yb-114246); and the latter, added with 5 mg/kg flavomycin. Basal diet supplementation with the combined Bacillus species improved egg-laying performance in aging hens significantly (P < 0.05). Eggshell strength improved significantly with this treatment, compared to the control or the antibiotic-supplemented groups (P < 0.05). The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in egg yolk declined significantly more in the Bacillus-treated group than in the control or the antibiotic-supplemented groups (P < 0.01). Small intestinal morphology was better in the hens treated with the Bacillus combination than in the hens in the control group (P < 0.05).

The questions are whether the observed inflammatory profile can be (a) improved by anti-inflammatory diets, and () if this improvement can in turn be translated into a significant fatigue reduction. The aim of this narrative review was to investigate the effect of anti-inflammatory nutrients, foods, and diets on inflammatory markers and fatigue in various patient populations. Next to observational and epidemiological studies, a total of 21 human trials have been evaluated in this work. Current available research is indicative, rather than evident, regarding the effectiveness of individuals' use of single nutrients with anti-inflammatory and fatigue-reducing effects. In contrast, clinical studies demonstrate that a balanced diet with whole grains high in fibers, polyphenol-rich vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acid-rich foods might be able to improve disease-related fatigue symptoms.

Considering the difficulties in the identification of Bacillus species and the poor microbiological quality of many probiotic formulations, we used three up-to-date methodological approaches for analyzing the content of ten formulations marketed in Italy and labeled to contain Bacillus spores. We compared the performance of biochemical tests based on the BCL Vitek2 card and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, using 16S rDNA sequencing as the reference technique. The BCL card performed well in identifying all Bacillus probiotic strains as well as the Bruker's MALDI Biotyper. Nevertheless, the MALDI score values were sometimes lower than those indicated by the manufacturer for correct species identification. Contaminant bacteria (Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus cereus, Brevibacillus choshinensis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus badius) were detected in some formulations. Characterization of the . cereus contaminant showed the potential pathogenicity of this strain. Microbial enumeration performed by the plate count method revealed that the number of viable cells contained in many of the analyzed products differed from the labeled amount. Overall, our data show that only two of the ten analyzed formulations qualitatively and quantitatively respect what is on the label. Since probiotic properties are most often strain specific, molecular typing of isolates of the two most common Bacillus species, . clausii and . coagulans, was also performed. In conclusion, the majority of the analyzed products do not comply with quality requirements, most likely leading to reduced/absent efficacy of the preparation and representing a potential infective risk for consumers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31403343>Non-antibiotic microbial solutions for bovine mastitis - live biotherapeutics, bacteriophage, and phage lysins.</a></h2><p>Bovine mastitis is a disease with a multi-etiological nature, defined as an inflammation of the udder. The main treatment for mastitis is the administration of antibiotics - usually directly to the udder. There is an urgent need for novel therapies to treat and prevent the disease, given the widespread emergence of antibiotic resistance and concomitant problems in the treatment of human and animal infections. We provide an overview of treatments for bovine mastitis, with emphasis on , bacteriocins, bacteriophages (phages), and phage endolysins.  have in recent years proved to be particularly efficacious in bovine mastitis treatment and prevention. In this case, the mode of action is most likely to be due to stimulation of the host immune response which clears the mastitis pathogen. Bacteriocins have the potential to be incorporated into teat washes and wipes, thus preventing pathogen spread on the farm. Phage therapy is limited by the inability of some phages to replicate in raw milk, as reported for some staphylococcal phages, and by their narrow host specificity. The use of phage endolysins is more promising, by enabling the development of broad host range potent antimicrobials, but additional research is required in terms of efficacy, safety and production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537964>Influence of Dehydrated Wheat/Rice Cereal Matrices on Probiotic Activity of  ssp.

At the end of the experiment, serological indicators, SCORAD, and DLQI indices were assessed. V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was sequenced to evaluate changes in the gut microbiota. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size was used to uncover microbial biomarkers and PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) was used to predict gene family abundances based on 16S information.The results demonstrated that CCFM8610 significantly decreased the SCORAD index, and increased the serum IL-10 levels. Supplement with CCFM8610 and CCFM16 significantly influenced the alpha diversity, increased the proportion of Bacteroidetes, and reduced the F/ ratio. CCFM8610 treatment downregulated the functional genes of gut microbiota involving Staphylococcus aureus infection and upregulated the steroid hormone biosynthesis.The results indicated a positive correlation between decreased SCORAD index and CCFM8610 treatment, and that CCFM8610 regulated the immune responses in AD patients.

Here, genetically engineered Lactobacillus casei (pPG-α/L. casei 393) constitutively expressing the toxoid of C. perfringens α-toxin was generated and its immunogenicity in mice for induction of protective immunity against the α-toxin was evaluated via oral immunization. The α-toxoid was constitutively expressed by pPG-α/L. casei 393 without a specific inducer, as confirmed by western blotting, laser confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. In an experiment on BALB/c mice to evaluate the oral immunogenicity of pPG-α/L. casei 393, significant levels of a specific secretory IgA (sIgA) antibody in the intestinal mucus and feces and an IgG antibody in the serum of the probiotic vaccine group were detected after booster immunization (p < 0.05) as compared with the pPG/L. casei 393 and PBS control groups.

In this study, we supplemented the larval stage of mass-reared . tryoni with bacterial . We tested several individual bacteria that had been previously isolated and characterized from the gut of wild . tryoni larvae including Asaia sp., Enterobacter sp., Lactobacillus sp., Leuconostoc sp. We also tested a consortium of all four of these bacterial isolates. The fitness parameters tested included adult survival in field cages, laboratory mate selection of bacteria supplemented males by bacteria nonsupplemented females, and laboratory locomotor activity of adult flies. None of the bacterial probiotic treatments in the current study was significantly different to the control for field survival, mate selection or locomotor activity of adult . tryoni, which agree with some of the other studies regarding bacterial  fed to the larval stage of tephritids. Future work is needed to determine if feeding the same, and/or other  to adults, as opposed to larvae can positively impact survival, mating performance, mating competitiveness and locomotor activity of . tryoni. The bacterial group(s) and function of bacterial species that increase fitness and competitiveness is also of interest to tephritid mass-rearing programs.© 2019 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796802>Supplementation with live yeast increases rate and extent of in vitro fermentation of nondigested feed ingredients by fecal microbiota.</a></h2><p>Two studies were conducted to investigate the effect of live yeast (LY) on the in vitro fermentation characteristics of wheat, barley, corn, soybean meal (SBM), canola meal, and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). In Study 1, LY yeast was added directly to in vitro fermentations inoculated with feces from lactating sows, whereas as in study 2, feces collected from lactating sows fed LY as a daily supplement was used. Selected feedstuffs were digested and the residue added to separate replicated (n = 3) fermentation reactions. Study 1 was conducted in two blocks, whereas study 2 was conducted using feces collected after a period of 3 (Exp. 1) or 4 wk (Exp. 2) of LY supplementation. Accumulated gas produced over 72 h was modeled for each substrate and the kinetics parameters compared between LY and control groups. The molar ratio of the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) produced in vitro were also compared at 12 and 72 h of incubation. In study 1, in vitro addition of yeast increased (P < 0.001) the rate of gas production (Rmax). However, a yeast × substrate effect (P < 0.05) observed for total gas accumulated (A), time to half asymptote (), and time required to reach maximum rate of fermentation (Tmax) suggested that yeast-mediated increases in extent and rate of fermentation varied by substrate. Greater total gas production was observed only for corn and SBM, associated with greater  and Tmax. Supplementation with LY appeared to increase A and Rmax although with variation between experiments and substrates. In Exp. 1, LY decreased (P < 0.05)  and Tmax. However, a yeast × substrate effect (P < 0.05) was observed for only A (for wheat, barley, corn, and corn DDGS) and Rmax (wheat, barley, corn, and wheat DDGS). In Exp. 2, LY increased (P < 0.0001) A and decreased . However, an interaction (P < 0.05) with substrates was observed for Rmax (except SBM) and Tmax. With exception of the DDGS samples, LY supplementation increased (P < 0.05) VFA production at 12 and 72 h of incubation. Yeast increased (P < 0.05) the molar ratios of acetic acid and branch-chain fatty acids at 12 h of incubation; however, this response was more variable by substrate at 72 h. In conclusion, LY supplementation increased the rate and extent of in vitro fermentation of a variety of substrates prepared from common feedstuffs. Greater effects were observed when LY was fed to sows than added directly in vitro, suggesting effects on fermentation were not mediated directly.© The Author(s) 2019.

Eighteen-week-old NZBWF1 [systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)] and NZW/LacJ (control) mice were treated with vehicle or LC40 (5 × 10 colony-forming units/d) for 15 wk. LC40 treatment reduced lupus disease activity, blood pressure, cardiac and renal hypertrophy, and splenomegaly in SLE mice. LC40 reduced the elevated T, , regulatory T cells (T), and T helper (T)-1 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes of lupus mice. LC40 lowered the higher plasma concentration of proinflammatory cytokines observed in lupus mice. Aortas from SLE mice showed reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to acetylcholine. Endothelial dysfunction found in SLE is related to an increase of both NADPH oxidase-driven superoxide production and eNOS phosphorylation at the inhibitory Thr. These activities returned to normal values after a treatment with LC40. Probiotic administration to SLE mice reduced plasma LPS levels, which might be related to an improvement of the gut barrier integrity. LC40 treatment increases the  count in gut microbiota of SLE mice.

Research into the microbiome-the microbial communities (microbiota) and the host environment that they inhabit-has changed our understanding about microbes in human health and disease. The gut microbiota, the largest reservoir of the microbiome in human, plays a critical role in our catabolic-metabolism and immunity. This review will show the changes of the view of microbes on human health. We will briefly discuss dysbiosis, the disruption of symbiotic relationship between the host and microbiota, and the associated diseases. This leads to an idea to manipulate the microbiota, either by restoring missing functions or by eliminating harmful functions, to prevent or treat a variety of diseases.

They harbor various bacteria, viruses, and fungal communities that are either beneficial or potentially pathogenic. Extensive metagenomic studies in bats are limited, particularly for the gut, and to date, there are no reports on the bacterial diversity of Rhinolophus monoceros from Meghalaya, India. There are limited studies on the isolation of potential harmful or beneficial bacteria and their interactions with the environment through culture-dependent approaches. Therefore, high-throughput screening was used to understand the population structure, genetic diversity, and ecological role of the microorganisms. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA marker for gene mapping showed that the gut samples constitute a diverse group of bacteria that is dominated by Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes. The bacterial genera Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium were also observed in the Illumina dataset. Illumina sequencing revealed eight bacterial phyla composed of 112 genera. The metagenomic analysis of the OTUs from the gut revealed diverse bacterial communities as well as zoonotic and human pathogens. There were differences in the bacterial communities between the two methods used in this study, which could be related to host specificity, diet, and habitat. The culture-dependent technique resulted in the isolation of 35 bacterial isolates, of which Bacillus cereus and . anthracis are well-known bacterial pathogens that show virulent traits including hemolytic and proteolytic activities. Pseudomonas stutzeri is an opportunistic human pathogen that was also isolated and showed similar traits. Antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed on all 35 isolates, and different antibiotics were used for Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The result showed that some isolates are resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin G and Cefoxitin. This report on gut bacterial communities could attract interest in the possibility of isolating and characterizing bacteria for the production of antibiotics, enzymes, plant growth promoters, and . However, the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria that may impose health hazards cannot be ignored and needs to be studied further.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The in vitro study characterized the effect of bile salt supplementation and pH on the proliferation of Lactobacillus reuteri, Pediococcus acidilactici, Bifidobacterium animalis, and Enterococcus faecium. L. reuteri and P. acidilactici growth was maximal when the media was supplemented with 1.0% bile salt, whereas . animalis and E. faecium growth was maximal when the media was supplemented with 0.5% bile salt. Altering the pH between 2.5 and 5.8 did not significantly (P > 0.05) alter the proliferation of L. reuteri and . animalis. Decreasing the pH from 5.8 to 2.0 decreased P. acidilactici growth, whereas it increased the E. faecium proliferation. The in vivo study quantified the concentration of L. reuteri, P. acidilactici, . animalis, E. faecium, and L. salivarius in different intestinal sections from birds supplemented with and without synbiotic containing the above 5 bacteria species. Birds were supplemented with and without synbiotic for 18 d, after which all birds were fed the same basal diet with no synbiotic. At 72 h of feeding, the basal diet with no synbiotics, when the probiotic species in the feed is expected not to confound the recovery of probiotic species from the intestine, intestinal contents were collected. L. reuteri, P. acidilactici, E. faecium, and L. salivarius were below detectable amount in the control group. L. reuteri concentration expressed as copy numbers/g and as percentage of total bacteria was highest in the jejunum and ileum, respectively. E. faecium concentration was highest in the ileum. The copy number of P. acidilactici increased at the duodenum and plateaued after duodenum. L. salivarius concentration was highest in the jejunum.

Despite its benefits, the risks associated with exposing large numbers of infants to antibiotics, especially long-term effects on health through changes in the microbiota, remain unclear. This systematic review summarises studies that have investigated the effect of IAP on the intestinal microbiota of infants.A systematic search in Ovid MEDLINE was used to identify original studies that investigated the effect of IAP on the intestinal microbiota in infants. Studies were excluded if: they included preterm infants, the antibiotic regimen was not specified, antibiotics were used for indications other than prophylaxis,  were given to mothers or infants, or antibiotics were given to infants.We identified six studies, which investigated a total of 272 infants and included 502 stool samples collected up to 3 months of age. In all the studies, IAP was given for group  streptococcus (GBS) colonisation. Infants who were exposed to GBS IAP had a lower bacterial diversity, a lower relative abundance of Actinobacteria, especially , and a larger relative abundance of Proteobacteria in their intestinal microbiota compared with non-exposed infants. Conflicting results were reported for the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.GBS IAP has profound effects on the intestinal microbiota of infants by diminishing beneficial commensals. Such changes during the early-life 'critical window' during which the intestinal microbiota and the immune response develop concurrently may have an important influence on immune development.

Exploitation of prebiotics and  for modulation of gut microbiota can lead to promising outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium longum BB-46 alone and in combination with a citric pectin from lemon on the gut microbiota from healthy adults using the Simulator of Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME). Changes in microbiota composition and in metabolic activity were assessed by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing and by analyses of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and ammonium ions (NH). An increase in the relative abundances of Firmicutes (especially the members of Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillaceae families) and Bacteroidetes was observed during treatment with . longum BB-46 alone in all compartments of the colon. Treatment with . longum BB-46 and pectin stimulated an increase in the proportions of genera Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium and Lactobacillus, as well as in the Ruminococcaceae family in the transverse and descending colons. Concurrently, the butyrate levels increased in these two compartments. Additionally, the combination of . longum BB-46 and pectin reduced the abundance of proteolytic bacteria Bacteroides, Clostridium, Peptoniphilus, and Streptococcus, along with decreased NH production. No significant changes could be observed on NH production by treatment with . longum BB-46, nor did it increase the amount of SCFAs. In this study, we observed that although each treatment was able to modulate the microbiota, the combination of . longum BB-46 and pectin was more efficient in decreasing the intestinal NH levels and in increasing butyric acid-producing bacteria. These findings indicate that . longum BB-46, especially when combined with the specific citric pectin, might have beneficial impact on human health.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The synthesis pattern of these antimicrobial peptides by P. alvei NP75 was studied extensively. The results were outstanding in a way that the paenibacillin N was synthesized irrespective of the growth of bacteria (non-ribosomal mediated), whereas paenibacillin P production was carried out by ribosomal mediated. In addition to the antimicrobial peptides, P. alvei NP75 also produces an immunogenic extracellular protease to defend itself from its own antimicrobial peptide, paenibacillin P. Furthermore, this immunogenic protease production was impaired by the addition of protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) treated strain (mutant) failed to produce paenibacillin P, whereas the production of neither paenibacillin N nor the protease was affected by the plasmid curing. The plasmid curing studies that divulge the genes responsible for the synthesis of paenibacillin N and protease were found to be genome encoded, and paenibacillin P was plasmid encoded. We are reporting, first of its kind, the co-production of two different antimicrobial peptides from P. alvei NP75 through non-ribosomal and ribosomal pathways that could be used as effective antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31033906>Bacillus Clausii Septicemia in a Pediatric Patient After Treatment With .</a></h2><p>Isolated cases of septicemia associated with  have been reported.

However, this ability is usually limited by gastrointestinal fluid and temperature sensitivity. Emulsification and internal gelation is an encapsulation technique with great potential for probiotic protection during storage and the gastrointestinal transit process. This study prepared microcapsules using an emulsification and internal gelation encapsulation method with sodium alginate, chitosan, and  as wall material, coating material, and experimental strain, respectively. Optical, scanning electron, and focal microscopes were used to observe the microcapsule surface morphology and internal viable cell distribution, and a laser particle size analyzer and zeta potentiometer were used to evaluate the chitosan-coating characteristics. In addition, microcapsule probiotic viability after storage, heat treatment, and simulated gastrointestinal fluid treatment were examined. Alginate microcapsules and chitosan-coated alginate microcapsules both had balling properties and uniform bacterial distribution. The latter kept its balling properties after freeze-drying, verified by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and had a clear external coating, observed by an optical microscope. The particle size of chitosan-coated alginate microcapsules was slightly larger than the uncoated microcapsules. The zeta potential of alginate and chitosan-coated alginate microcapsules was negative and positive, respectively. Heat, acid and bile salt tolerance, and stability tests revealed that the decrease of viable cells in the chitosan-coated alginate microcapsule group was significantly lower than that in uncoated microcapsules.

A total of 240 Hy-Line Brown laying hens (28 weeks old) were randomly divided into four groups, and three replicates per group (n = 20 per replicate). The control group was fed a standard basal diet, and the three treatment groups were provided the basal diet supplemented with either 0.01%, 0.03%, or 0.06% . amyloliquefaciens BLCC1-0238 (2 × 10 CFU/g), respectively. Hens were allowed 2 weeks to acclimate prior to initiation of the 8-week experiment. It was observed that dietary supplementation with 0.01% or 0.03% . amyloliquefaciens BLCC1-0238 significantly increased egg production and egg mass. However, no significant differences in feed intake, egg weight, and feed conversion ratio among the four groups were observed. Different levels of . amyloliquefaciens BLCC1-0238 supplementation also significantly increased egg shell strength and thickness. With respect to the levels of reproductive hormones in the hens, . amyloliquefaciens BLCC1-0238 supplementation significantly reduced serum adrenal cortical hormone (ACTH) levels, while increasing estradiol (E2) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion in the treatment groups compared to the control group.

The composition of microbiota varies from host to host, and it changes during the lifetime. It is known that microbiome may be changed because of a diet, bacteriophages and different processes for example, such as inflammation. Like all other areas of medicine, there is a continuous growth in the area of microbiology. Different microbes can reside in all sites of a human body, even in locations that were previously considered as sterile; for example, liver, pancreas, brain and adipose tissue. Presently one of the etiological factors for liver disease is considered to be pro-inflammatory changes in a host's organism. There are lot of supporting data about intestinal dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability and its effect on development of liver disease pointing to the gut-liver axis. The gut-liver axis affects pathogenesis of many liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis , chronic hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Gut microbiota has been implicated in the regulation of brain health, emphasizing the gut-brain axis. Also, experiments with mice showed that microorganisms have significant effects on the blood-brain barrier integrity. Microbiota can modulate a variety of mechanisms through the gut-liver axis and gut-brain axis. Normal intestinal flora impacts the health of a host in many positive ways, but there is now significant evidence that intestinal microbiota, especially altered, have the ability to impact the pathologies of many diseases through different inflammatory mechanisms.

Clinical indexes of mice in the C. butyricum-treated groups were significantly improved and comparable to those in the antibiotic group. Pap staining showed that neutrophil count was significantly increased after modelling and largely decreased after C. butyricum treatment (P < 0·01). Dynamic observation of E. coli and Lactobacillus showed that the number of E. coli significantly decreased in the C. butyricum-treated groups or in the antibiotic group with prolonged treatment (P < 0·01). Besides, the number of E. coli in the low-dose C. butyricum group was higher than that in either its high-dose counterpart or the antibiotic group respectively (P < 0·01). The number of Lactobacillus decreased evidently in the antibiotic group (P < 0·01), while that in the C. butyricum groups remained consistent.

The upregulated antimicrobial peptide NK-lysin and guanylate-binding protein 1 expression levels indicated that this strain enhanced the body's antimicrobial capacity. . cereus PAS38 also amplified the broilers' immune response to the vaccine, which mainly reflected on nonspecific immunity. Hence, probiotic . cereus PAS38 can regulate and promote the immune function of broilers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31445119>In-vitro effect of vaginal lactobacilli against group  Streptococcus.</a></h2><p>Streptococcus agalactiae(GBS) is a leading cause of infection during pregnancy, preterm birth and neonatal infection, with a significant clinical and socio-economic impact. To prevent maternal GBS vaginal colonization, new antibiotic-free approaches, based on lactobacilli , are advisable. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-GBS activity of 14 vaginal Lactobacillus strains, belonging to different species (L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. vaginalis), isolated from healthy pre-menopausal women. In particular, we performed 'inhibition' experiments, evaluating the ability of both Lactobacillus cells and culture supernatants in reducing Streptococcus viability, after 60 min contact time. First, we demonstrated that the acidic milieu, produced by vaginal lactobacilli metabolism, is crucial in counteracting GBS growth in a pH-dependent manner. Experiments with organic/inorganic acid solutions confirmed the strict correlation between pH levels and the anti-GBS activity. GBS was more sensitive to lactic acid than to hydrochloric acid, indicating that the presence of H ions is necessary but not sufficient for the inhibitory activity. Moreover, experiments with Lactobacillus pH-adjusted supernatants led to exclude a direct role in the anti-GBS activity by other bioactive molecules. Second, we found that only a few Lactobacillus strains were able to reduce Streptococcus viability by means of cell pellets. The anti-GBS effect displayed by Lactobacillus cells was related to the their ability to interact and aggregate with Streptococcus cells. We found that the anti-GBS activity was retained after methanol/proteinase K treatment, but lost after lysozyme exposure of Lactobacillus cells. Therefore, we supposed that non-proteinaceous components of Lactobacillus cell wall could be responsible for the anti-GBS activity. In conclusion, we identified specific Lactobacillus strains able to interfere with GBS viability by multiple strategies and we elucidated some of the mechanisms of action. These strains could serve as probiotic formulations for the prevention of GBS vaginal colonization.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the availability of RS as a prebiotic is a topic of interest and research on gut bacteria that can decompose RS is also important. The objectives in this study were 1) to isolate human gut bacterium having strong degradation activity on non-gelatinized RS, 2) to characterize its RS-degrading characteristics, and 3) to investigate its probiotic effects including a growth stimulation effect on other gut bacteria and an immunomodulatory effect.  P2P3 showing very strong RS granule utilization activity was isolated. It can attach to RS granules and form the clusters of RS granules. Also, it was able to utilize high amylose corn starch (HACS) granules up to 63.3%, and efficiently decompose other various types of commercial RS without gelatinization. In a coculture experiment,  ATCC 29148, isolated from human feces, were capable to grow using carbon sources generated from RS granules by  P2P3. In addition,  P2P3 demonstrated the ability to stimulate secretion of Th1 type cytokines from mouse macrophages  that was not shown in other .

AR bacteria can be acquired in early life and have long-term sequelae. Limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance without triggering the development of additional resistance mechanisms is of immense clinical value. Here, we show how the infant gut microbiome can be modified, resulting in a significant reduction of AR genes (ARGs) and the potentially pathogenic bacteria that harbor them.The gut microbiome was characterized using shotgun metagenomics of fecal samples from two groups of healthy, term breastfed infants. One group was fed  EVC001 in addition to receiving lactation support ( = 29, EVC001-fed), while the other received lactation support alone ( = 31, controls). Coliforms were isolated from fecal samples and genome sequenced, as well as tested for minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics.Infants fed  EVC001 exhibited a change to the gut microbiome, resulting in a 90% lower level of ARGs compared to controls. ARGs that differed significantly between groups were predicted to confer resistance to beta lactams, fluoroquinolones, or multiple drug classes, the majority of which belonged to ,  and . Minimal inhibitory concentration assays confirmed the resistance phenotypes among isolates with these genes. Notably, we found extended-spectrum beta lactamases among healthy, vaginally delivered breastfed infants who had never been exposed to antibiotics.Colonization of the gut of breastfed infants by a single strain of  subsp.  had a profound impact on the fecal metagenome, including a reduction in ARGs. This highlights the importance of developing novel approaches to limit the spread of these genes among clinically relevant bacteria. Future studies are needed to determine whether colonization with  EVC001 decreases the incidence of AR infections in breastfed infants.This clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425831>Effects of potential probiotic Bacillus velezensis K2 on growth, immunity and resistance to Vibrio harveyi infection of hybrid grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus♂ × E. fuscoguttatus♀).</a></h2><p>Nowadays, there is no suitable treatment for vibriosis in groupers. So an eco-efficient and environmentally friendly treatment is necessary for the grouper industry. Probiotic-feeding has been a promising strategy to control the bacterial pathogens in aquaculture. A new Bacillus velezensis strain named K2 was isolated from the intestinal tract of healthy grouper, and exhibited wide antimicrobial spectrum of against fish pathogens, including Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio alginolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas veronii, Aeromonas caviae, Enterococcus casseliflavus and Lactococcus garvieae. Moreover, results of the safety of . velezensis K2 showed that intraperitoneal injection of K2 in healthy grouper did not cause any pathological abnormality or death, indicating this bacteria could be considered as a candidate probiotic in aquaculture. Groupers were fed with the diets containing 1 × 10 cfu/g of . velezensis K2 for 4 weeks. Various immune parameters were examined at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of post-feeding. Results showed that diets supplemented with K2 significantly increased serum acid phosphatase (ACP) activity (P < 0.05). Results of the mRNA expression of immune-related genes in the head kidney of hybrid grouper showed that the expression of lysozyme gene was significantly upregulated after 1 and 2 weeks of feeding (P < 0.05). A significant up-regulation of the expression of piscidin, IgM and MyD88 were detected at day 21, whereas the TLR3 and TLR5 showed lower expression compared to the controls during 21 days, and a significant decrease of TLR3 gene was found at day 28 (P < 0.05). After challenge with V. harveyi, the survival rate of fish administrated with the strain K2 for 28 days was signifiacantly higher than the controls without this strain (P < 0.05).

The ghrelin receptor [growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)-1a] is a GPCR expressed throughout both the gut and the brain and plays a crucial role in maintaining energy balance, metabolism, and the central modulation of food intake, motivation, reward, and mood. To date, few studies have investigated the potential of the gastrointestinal microbiota and its metabolites to modulate GPCR signaling. Here we investigate the ability of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lactate, and different bacterial strains, including  and  genera, to modulate GHSR-1a signaling. We identify, for what is to our knowledge the first time, a potent effect of microbiota-derived metabolites on GHSR-1a signaling with potential significant consequences for host metabolism and physiology. We show that SCFAs, lactate, and bacterial supernatants are able to attenuate ghrelin-mediated signaling through the GHSR-1a. We suggest a novel route of communication between the gut microbiota and the host  modulation of GHSR-1a receptor signaling.

NK33 and NK98 potently suppressed NF-κ activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 cells. Treatment with NK33 and/or NK98, which were orally gavaged in mice before or after IS treatment, significantly suppressed the occurrence and development of anxiety/depression, infiltration of Iba1⁺ and LPS⁺/CD11b⁺ cells (activated microglia) into the hippocampus, and corticosterone, IL-6, and LPS levels in the blood. Furthermore, they induced hippocampal BDNF expression while NF-κ activation was suppressed. NK33 and/or NK98 treatments suppressed IS-induced colon shortening, myeloperoxidase activity, infiltration of CD11b⁺/CD11c⁺ cells, and IL-6 expression in the colon. Their treatments also suppressed the IS-induced fecal Proteobacteria population and excessive LPS production. They also induced BDNF expression in LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells in vitro.

Lipid peroxidation procedurally appears, ferroptosis, apoptosis and necrosis are often induced, subsequently, mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction and even cell death occur. As a result, the intestinal epithelial cells are destroyed, leading to the incompleteness of intestinal mechanical barrier. Simultaneously, iron supplement can change the compositions and metabolic processes of intestinal microbes, and the intestinal inflammatory may be worsened. In principle, the easier dissociation of Fe from oral iron supplements is, the more serious intestinal inflammation will occur. Fortunately, some interventions have been developed to alleviate these side effects. For instance, some antioxidants e.g. VE and ferulic acid have been used to prevent the formation of free radicals or to neutralize the formed free radicals. Furthermore, some new iron supplements with the ability of slow-releasing Fe, e.g. ferrous citrate liposome and EDTA iron sodium, have been successfully prepared.

In this study, fermentation of pineapple juice with probiotic bacteria  and  strains as well as changes of some properties in the beverage during storage were investigated. All tested strains exhibited good growth properties on pineapple juice without supplementation of any nutrient compounds. After 24 h fermentation, the cell counts of lactobacilli passed the level of 510 cfu/ml, while the cell number of bifidobacteria reached a level of 10 cfu/ml. The highest volumetric productivity (3.510 cfu/mlh) was observed in  299V. The ratios of lactic acids to acetic acids in the cases of  299V and  La5 were 5.37 and 9.91, respectively. In the case of  Bb-12, the concentrations of lactic acid and acetic acid were 6 mM and 23 mM in natural juices, and 15 and 21 mM in the case of supplementation with prebiotics at the 16 h of fermentation, respectively. Additionally, supplementation with prebiotics at the initiation of fermentation resulted 7 mM lactic acid and 23 mM acetic acid at the end of fermentation. Fructose was the most preferred sugar for both lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Both total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity increased slightly during fermentation and dropped during the storage period.

In order to gain insight into the influence of paraimmunobiotic bifidobacteria on the innate antiviral immune response of BIE cells, their effect on the transcriptomic response triggered by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation was investigated. By using microarray technology and qPCR analysis, we obtained a global overview of the immune genes involved in the innate antiviral immune response in BIE cells. Activation of TLR3 by poly(I:C) in BIE cells significantly increased the expression of interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-β, several interferon-stimulated genes, cytokines, and chemokines. It was also observed that both paraimmunobiotic bifidobacteria differently modulated immune genes expression in poly(I:C)-challenged BIE cells. Most notable changes were found in genes involved in antiviral defence (IFN-β, MX1, OAS1X, MDA5, TLR3, STAT2, STAT3), cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6), and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL2, CXCL6) that were significantly increased in bifidobacteria-treated BIE cells. . infantis MCC12 and . breve MCC1274 showed quantitative and qualitative differences in their capacities to modulate the innate antiviral immune response in BIE cells. . breve MCC1274 was more efficient than the MCC12 strain to improve the production of type I IFNs and antiviral factors, an effect that could be related to its higher ability to protect against rotavirus replication in BIE cells. Interestingly, . infantis MCC12 showed a remarkable anti-inflammatory effect.

To improve the subtilosin productivity of . subtilis, different growth conditions were compared for maximal expression of the sbo promoter that regulates the expression of the subtilosin biosynthetic gene cluster. Oxygen-limiting conditions led to a strong increase of sbo promoter activities compared to aerobic conditions, and accordingly, the subtilosin amount determined by reversed phase HPLC (7.8 mg/L) was 15-fold superior to the amount of aerobic grown cultures (0.5 mg/L). A further promising enhancement of the subtilosin yield was achieved using a deletion mutant that is avoiding the general transition state regulator protein AbrB. The subtilosin titer of 42 mg/L produced by ΔabrB cells grown under oxygen-limiting conditions corresponds to an 84-fold increase compared to the subtilosin titer obtained from . subtilis wild type cells propagated in aerobic conditions. Furthermore, evidence is provided that oxygen-limiting conditions led to a strong decrease in the productivity of the lantipeptide subtilin suggesting contrary regulatory mechanisms for the . subtilis antimicrobials subtilin and subtilosin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635441> S1 Improves Colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid by the Inhibition of NF-κ Signaling in Mice.</a></h2><p> S1 strongly inhibits the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide-induced peritoneal macrophages for the mechanism that lactic acid bacteria from kimchi inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was isolated. The protective effect of this strain on the colitis mouse model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) was further evaluated. TNBS significantly elevated myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic scores, and colon shortening. Oral  S1 administration resulted in reduction of TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ).  S1 inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, induced by TNBS, but enhanced IL-10 expression.  S1 showed resistance to artificial digestive juices and adherence to intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. Thus,  S1 may inhibit the NF-κ pathway and be used as functional food to treat colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894554>Benefits of a Bacillus probiotic to larval fish survival and transport stress resistance.</a></h2><p>The need for sustainable bacterial management approaches in aquaculture is crucial for advancement of the industry.  are a promising strategy as evidenced by benefits demonstrated in intensive larviculture of various marine fish species. In this study we investigate the effects of a mixed Bacillus species (. licheniformis and . amyloliquefaciens) probiotic on rearing of larval common snook (Centropomus undecimalis). Experimental treatments included (1)  supplemented to the water and live feed, (2)  supplemented to the water only, and (3) no probiotic controls. Data from two separate trials indicated up to 2.5 times higher survival with probiotic addition, as well as 20% higher survival 7 days following a transport event. These benefits were not explained by faster growth, measured water quality parameters, or innate immune enzyme activities. Microbiota analysis indicated the importance of system stabilization prior to larval stocking to improve rearing success and probiotic performance. ied Potential probiotic benefits include accelerated gastrointestinal tract development, enhanced immunity, inhibition of opportunistic bacteria, and improvements to water quality parameters.

Here, we adopted an approach based on direct observation of symbiotic or axenic flies feeding on dishes seeded with drops of full diet (containing all amino acids) or full diet supplemented with bacteria at similar concentrations to explore the effects of intestinal bacteria on foraging decision and fitness of Bactrocera dorsalis.The results show that intestinal  elicit beneficial foraging decision and enhance the female reproduction fitness and survival of . dorsalis (symbiotic and axenic), yet preferences for probiotic diets were significantly higher in axenic flies to which they responded faster compared to full diet. Moreover, females fed diet supplemented with Pantoea dispersa and Enterobacter cloacae laid more eggs but had shorter lifespan while female fed Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella oxytoca enriched diets lived longer but had lower fecundity compared to the positive control. Conversely, flies fed sugar diet (negative control) were not able to produce eggs, but lived longer than those from the positive control.These results suggest that intestinal bacteria can drive the foraging decision in a way which promotes the reproduction and survival of . dorsalis.

As a feed additive, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can enhance the host's innate immunity. β-glucan, a cell wall component of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can stimulate innate immune responses and trigger the up-regulation of SBD-1 in ORECs. The signaling mechanisms involved in β-glucan-induced SBD-1 expression are not completely understood. The aim of this study was to identify the receptors and intracellular pathways involved in the up-regulation of SBD-1 induced by β-glucan. ORECs were cultured, and the regulatory mechanisms of β-glucan-induced up-regulation of SBD-1 were detected using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and western blotting. TLR-2 and MyD88 knockdown or inhibition attenuated β-glucan-induced SBD-1 expression. We also showed that inhibition of MAPK and NF-κ pathways significantly reduced β-glucan-induced SBD-1 expression. These results demonstrate that β-glucan-induced SBD-1 expression is TLR-2-MyD88-dependent and may be regulated by both MAPK and NF-κ pathways. Since NF-κ inhibition had a greater effect on the down-regulation of β-glucan-induced SBD-1 expression, the NF-κ pathway may be the dominant signaling pathway involved in the regulation of defensin expression. Our studies demonstrate that β-glucan-induced SBD-1 expression is mediated through the TLR-2-MyD88-NF-κ/MAPK pathway. Our results would contribute to the understanding of immunological modulations in the gastrointestinal tract triggered by probiotic yeast cell wall components.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30929605>Effects of sodium butyrate and active Bacillus amyloliquefaciens supplemented to pasteurized waste milk on growth performance and health condition of Holstein dairy calves.</a></h2><p>The objectives of the present study were to examine the impact of feeding both  and sodium butyrate on calf performance and the economic implication of each treatment. A completely randomized design was used to investigate body weight (BW) gain, feed conversion efficiency and health conditions of Holstein dairy calves fed either pasteurized waste milk (PWM; n = 9) or a non-medicated milk replacer containing sodium butyrate and active probiotic Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (NMR; n = 9) from birth to 60 days of age. Numerically, calves fed PWM consumed more starter feed between days 16 and 45 than calves fed NMR but the difference became smaller by 60 days. Birth weights and colostrum IgG and serum total protein concentrations did not differ (p > 0.05) between the PWM and NMR calves. Calves receiving PWM had slightly greater BW at days 30 and 45, but were similar to that of calves receiving NMR at day 60. No differences were observed between PWM and NMR-calves for BW gains, flank height, hip width and health conditions (p < 0.05). Calves fed NMR had more watery feces but less frequent bouts of coughing than PWM-fed calves. Feed cost was higher (p < 0.001) for PWM-fed calves than NMR-fed calves during the experimental period.

To assure the neuroprotection came from increased production of butyrate, we further determined beneficial effects of butyrate in the MPTP-mediated PD model. The probiotic mixture overtly protected the dopaminergic neurons against MPTP neurotoxicity. However, the  downregulated expression of monoamine oxidase (MAO)  in the striatum, which was accompanied by a lower level of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP), the main neurotoxic metabolite of MPTP. Thus, we extended the investigation into the rotenone-induced PD model. Rescuing effects of the  were observed in the setup, which came with increased levels of neurotrophic factors and butyrate in the brain. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG was identified to be a major contributor to the induction of neurotrophic factors and downregulation of MAO . Finally, we demonstrated that sodium butyrate attenuated MPTP-induced neuronal loss in the nigrostriatal pathway.  could ameliorate neurodegeneration at least partially by increasing butyrate level.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for more than 90% of diabetic patients, mainly caused by environmental factors. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibit several health benefits to the host including regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and improving oxidative stress and inflammatory response. However, the anti-diabetic mechanism of  has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, the anti-diabetic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 on T2D mice were assessed. Oral administration of L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 for 6 weeks significantly improved the epithelial barrier function, which in turn lowered inflammation cytokines, including IL-8, TNF-α and IL-1β in liver and colon tissue, and prevented liver and colon tissue injuries to some extent. Additionally, L. acidophilus treatment regulated the expression genes that are related to glucose and lipid metabolism. The two tested strains down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c), and up-regulated the expression of protein kinase  (Akt). However, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 is better for improving T2D than L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003. Further research showed that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 supplementation could reshape gut microbiota, increasing short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Blautia, Roseburia and Anaerotruncus) and the level of SCFAs and decreasing the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria such as Desulfovibrio, Alistipes and Bacteroides. Notably, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 treatment restored the structure of gut microbiota similar to the control group. These findings suggested that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 might be used as a new type of antidiabetic drug candidate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521398>Mediterranean diet: The role of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids in fish; polyphenols in fruits, vegetables, cereals, coffee, tea, cacao and wine;  and vitamins in prevention of stroke, age-related cognitive decline, and Alzheimer disease.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms of action of the dietary components of the Mediterranean diet are reviewed in prevention of cardiovascular disease, stroke, age-associated cognitive decline and Alzheimer disease. A companion article provides a comprehensive review of extra-virgin olive oil. The benefits of consumption of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids are described. Fresh fish provides eicosapentaenoic acid while α-linolenic acid is found in canola and soybean oils, purslane and nuts. These ω-3 fatty acids interact metabolically with ω-6 fatty acids mainly linoleic acid from corn oil, sunflower oil and peanut oil. Diets rich in ω-6 fatty acids inhibit the formation of healthier ω-3 fatty acids. The deleterious effects on lipid metabolism of excessive intake of carbohydrates, in particular high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners, are explained. The critical role of the ω-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid in the developing and aging brain and in Alzheimer disease is addressed. Nutritional epidemiology studies, prospective population-based surveys, and clinical trials confirm the salutary effects of fish consumption on prevention of coronary artery disease, stroke and dementia. Recent recommendations on fish consumption by pregnant women and potential mercury toxicity are reviewed. The polyphenols and flavonoids of plant origin play a critical role in the Mediterranean diet, because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of benefit in type-2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer prevention. Polyphenols from fruits and vegetables modulate tau hyperphosphorylation and beta amyloid aggregation in animal models of Alzheimer disease. From the public health viewpoint worldwide the daily consumption of fruits and vegetables has become the main tool for prevention of cardiovascular disease and stroke.

In this paper, the effects of dietary  and coccidial vaccination on diversity and composition of cecal microbiota were investigated using a 3 (diets) × 2 (vaccinated or non-vaccinated) factorial setting of treatments. Three diets, including a corn and soybean-meal control diet, an antibiotic diet (a control diet supplemented with bacitracin and salinomycin), and a probiotic diet (a control diet supplemented with Bacillus subtilis) were provided to broiler chicken from day 0 to 42. To simulate an Eimeria challenge in the field, all chicks were gavaged with a 20× dose of commercial coccidial vaccine containing live Eimeria oocysts on day 14. Cecal contents were collected on day 42. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to determine microbial diversity and composition. Coccidial vaccination to broilers reduced bacterial diversity (Shannon index) of the cecal microbiota. There was a significant interaction between the dietary additive and coccidial vaccination on the observed bacterial species number. Diets supplemented with . subtilis increased bacterial species of non-vaccinated broilers but decreased bacterial species of vaccinated broilers. In contrast, diets supplemented with antibiotics reduced bacterial species of broilers from both groups. Interactions between dietary additive and coccidial vaccination were also observed on microbial composition. Vaccinated broilers fed the . subtilis diet exhibited the lowest Firmicutes percentage and highest Bacteroidetes percentage within the microbial community. In addition, vaccinated broilers fed the . subtilis diet exhibited the highest Rikenella microfusus percentage. From this study, the coccidial vaccination on the day of hatch reduced the microbial diversity of broilers at a later age.

Regulating the microbial community in a desirable direction may be beneficial in aquaculture for preventing and controlling the diseases caused by pathogenic microbes. In this study, we investigated the changes in the microflora in the intestinal tracts of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) larvae after introducing a probiotic (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) after the first feed. . amyloliquefaciens was added as part of a nutrient enrichment system in live feed (Branchionus plicatilis or Artemia sinica), so it passed into the intestinal tracts of the newly hatched turbot larvae. The turbot larvae were fed on live feed containing . amyloliquefaciens in the experimental group, whereas live feed without the probiotic was provided to larvae in the control group. The total bacterial genomic DNA in the larval guts was extracted and sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq PE250 system. According to the sequencing results, the abundances of microbial species and the microflora diversity were lower in the intestines in the experimental group than the control. Throughout development, the microflora structure in the intestines was mainly constructed before the first feed and the composition of the dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was stable, where the abundances of OTU8, OTU124, OTU150, OTU107, and OTU17 were always high. Compared with the control, the structures of the microflora in the intestines were similar on different days during the development and the growth of larvae in the experimental group. However, the similarity of the microflora structure between different treatments was low on the same day. Furthermore, the mean proportion of common OTUs was only 74.7% in different treatments on each day, which indicates that the introduction of . amyloliquefaciens in the live feed changed the microflora structure in the intestine. During the early development stage (days 3-30), the average abundance of Pseudomonas was reduced by 0.8% whereas that of Lactococcus increased by 3.5% in the experimental group. Pseudomonas spp. are considered potentially pathogenic bacteria but there is no direct evidence for the pathogenicity of Lactococcus in turbot. Moreover, several Lactococcus species are regarded as  in aquaculture. Therefore, the use of . amyloliquefaciens could be beneficial for optimizing the microbial community structure in the intestines of turbot larvae, which may explain the probiotic effect of . amyloliquefaciens.

HCT-116 cell treatment with LABs beneficially modulated the mRNA levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL-10), 2-5A oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OSA1), myxovirus resistance protein (MxA), TLR3, and retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and TLR negative regulators. In addition, LABs increased IFN-β, IFN-α, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) and decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β protein/mRNA levels in THP-1 cells. LABs also protected the cells by maintaining tight-junction proteins (zonula occludens-1 and occludin). The beneficial effects of these LABs were mediated via modulation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ) pathways. Overall, the results of this study indicate that immunobiotics have potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities that may use as antiviral substitutes for human and animal applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954529>Identification of a microglial activation-dependent antidepressant effect of amphotericin  liposome.</a></h2><p>Chronic stress-induced decline in microglia in the hippocampus is a newly hypothesized mechanism of depression, and reversal of this decline by microglial activators has been shown to suppress depression-like behaviors in mice. This suggests that activation of immune cells in the hippocampus may be a potential strategy for depression therapy. Since amphotericin , an anti-fungal medication, is known to activate macrophages and microglia, we investigated whether conventional amphotericin  or its liposomal form displays antidepressant activity. Our results showed that both amphotericin  and its liposomal form at various doses induced obvious depression-like behaviors in naïve mice, likely owing to increased serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β levels. However, under stressed conditions, amphotericin  liposome, but not amphotericin  itself, reversed chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced increase in immobility time in the tail suspension test and forced swim test as well as CUS-induced decrease in sucrose intake in the sucrose preference test and the time spent in the center region of the open field test in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that amphotericin  liposome reversed the CUS-induced decline in dentate gyrus (DG) microglia, and inhibition or ablation of microglia in the hippocampus by minocycline (40 mg/kg) or PLX3397 pre-treatment (290 mg/kg) abrogated the antidepressant effect of the amphotericin  liposome in CUS-treated mice. These results not only identify a novel pharmacological effect of amphotericin  liposome, but further support the notion that microglial activation in the hippocampus is a potential strategy for depression therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

IPLA 20020 and  IPLA 20212, two strains isolated from human samples, were evaluated for safety and influence over the intestinal microbiota and cytokine production by the intestinal tissue of adult BALB/c mice. Mice were divided into four groups receiving during 8 days PBS or a suspension of each strain, prepared fresh or lyophilized (bifidobacteria), at an amount of 4x10 viable cells/day. This dose could be comparable to the probiotic intake of a human adult who consumed about 100-200 mL of functional fermented milk per day, considering the usual level of  in commercial products. No microbial translocation to liver or alterations in food intake, weight, and behavior were observed in treated mice. Intestinal content of secretory immunoglobulin A (s-IgA) was not affected, discarding any adverse effect on the mucosa-associated immunity. The profile of intestinal proinflammatory/regulatory cytokines after intervention evidenced that the microbial strain administered and its cellular state (fresh or lyophilized) as well as the host tissue analyzed (small or large intestine) influenced the immune response and suggests a moderate shift towards a T helper 1 profile (Th1) in the large intestine after the administration of both strains. Changes on relative levels of some intestinal microbial groups were evidenced after intervention. It is noteworthy that butyrate was positively associated with a balanced pro-Th1 immune response. Therefore,  subsp IPLA20020 and  IPLA 20212 could be considered potential probiotic candidates to be included in functional foods for balancing the intestinal immune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421399>Behavior of different Bacillus strains with claimed probiotic properties throughout processed cheese ("requeijão cremoso") manufacturing and storage.</a></h2><p>Even though spore-forming bacteria have been mainly linked to spoilage or foodborne pathogens vehiculated through foods, some strains of Bacillus can potentially present probiotic properties. The advantage of incorporating probiotic Bacillus strains in foods relies mainly on the fact that these microorganisms present high resistance to harsh processing conditions. "Requeijão cremoso" is a type of processed cheese highly appreciated in Brazil. During processing, this product is submitted to several harsh conditions (heating at 90 °C, for instance), leading to the inactivation of probiotic bacteria belonging to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera. That fact has precluded the development of probiotic "requeijão cremoso" products; however, probiotic Bacillus strains may comprise a promising alternative to overcome the low resistance of traditional  to food processing. The objective of this study was to evaluate the behavior of different Bacillus strains with claimed probiotic properties throughout processed cheese ("requeijão cremoso") manufacturing. A total of five different Bacillus strains with claimed probiotic properties (. coagulans MTCC 5856, . coagulans GBI-30 6086, . subtilis PXN 21, . subtilis PB6, and . flexus HK1) were individually inoculated at different stages of manufacture - curd pasteurization, coagulation, and fusion - of "requeijão cremoso" and their survival in each of these stages was determined. The survival of . coagulans GBI-30 6086 was further assessed throughout "requeijão cremoso" production and shelf life (45 days at 6 °C). Besides, the chemical composition, level of proteolysis, and fatty acid profile of the treatments during shelf life were evaluated. The fusion stage was found as the most appropriate for the addition of . coagulans GBI-30 6086, which allows the production of probiotic "requeijão cremoso" and facilitates the technological process while preventing the occurrence of final product recontamination.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The full-length CB gene was first synthesized and fused to the 5' end of the hLyso gene. The recombinant CB-hLyso was then subcloned in plasmid pET32a, and pET32a-CB-hLyso was transferred into Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21(DE3) and BL21(DE3)pLysS. The results showed that in the original culture media, Luria-Bertani (LB) media and terrific broth (TB), at 37 or 25 °C, CB-hLyso was barely expressed; however, when the original culture medium was replaced with an equi-volume of fresh medium, obvious expression occurred in BL21(DE3)pLysS/pET32a-CB-hLyso at 25 °C, and the expression in TB (25%) was higher than that in LB (15%). Through a two-step chromatographic method consisting of Ni-chelated Sepharose Fast Flow affinity and Sephadex G-75 size-exclusion, the crude fusion CB-hLyso was isolated in a homogeneous form, and preliminary bacteriostasis experiments showed that the fusion CB-hLyso had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of Staphylococci.

A total of 720, 4-week-old Shaver White chicks were allotted to control (CON), 1.1E+08 (low, LSSB), 2.2E+08 (medium, MSSB), or 1.1E+09 (high, HSSB) CFU/kg of diet groups. At grower (10-week), developer (16-week), and laying (28-week) phases, excreta and cecal digesta samples were taken for AR, microbial, and SCFA analyses. Microbial analysis involved high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA gene. Bacterial diversity decreased ( < 0.05) at the developer phase as the SSB dose increased; however, a distinct clustering pattern ( < 0.05) of bacterial community was noted.  and  were differentially enriched in the developer for SSB-fed compared to CON-fed birds. Although no differences in microbial diversity were detected in grower and layer phases, different species of  (XVIII, XIVa, IV, and XIVb)-major butyrate producers-were identified in all phases, with stronger effect sizes for SSB-fed compared to CON-fed birds. Isobutyric acid was elevated in dose response ( = 0.034) in layer phase. In addition, the relative abundances of , , and  were positively correlated ( < 0.05), with AR of most components for SSB-fed birds in the pullet phase. The results suggested that supplementing chickens' diet with  DSM 29784 may selectively enrich beneficial bacterial communities, which in turn are critical in promoting the growth and performance of hens. In egg-laying chickens, the trend in the move away from the cage to alternative housing systems and restriction in antimicrobial use requires alternative approaches to maintain health and prevent diseases. There is increased research and commercial interest toward alternative gut health solutions while improving the performance and product safety in poultry production systems. One such approach, in recognition of the importance of the gut microbial community, is the use of microbes as feed supplements (such as ). Unlike meat-type chickens, studies assessing the efficacy of such microbial supplements are limited for egg-laying chickens. Thus, by conducting a comprehensive assessment of the hen microbiota in response to various levels of  DSM 29784 during the pullet phase (grower and developer) and the layer phase, the present study demonstrates the importance of direct-fed microbes in modulating gut microbiome, which may relate to improved performance efficiency in the pullet and layer phases.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640253>Neonate Bloodstream Infections in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Countries: An Update on Epidemiology and Prevention.</a></h2><p>The term neonatal sepsis is used to describe a generalized bloodstream infection of bacterial, viral, or fungal origin which is associated with hemodynamic changes and other clinical symptoms and signs, however, there is no unified definition. There are no basic criteria regarding differentiation of early-onset sepsis (EOS) versus late-onset sepsis (LOS). Stratification used in studies on neonatal sepsis also rarely includes the general condition of the newborn according to unambiguous assessment at birth, which hampers the establishment of a clear, uniform epidemiological description of neonatal sepsis. We aim to review the published data about the epidemiology and microbiology of sepsis in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Data was also collected on sepsis prevention programs that can be implemented in neonatal units. The outcomes of interest were incidence or incidence density of EOS and LOS, microbiology of EOS and LOS, and data on the methodology of the research, in particular the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of newborns from the study. Pubmed, EMBASE, LILACS Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar were used. For the preselection step, inclusion criteria included: "bloodstream infection" or "neonatal sepsis" (MesH), "very low birth weight", and "country" full-text studies, human, and English language. Exclusion criteria included: studies published in languages other than English and studies available only as an abstracts. For proper selection, inclusion criteria included: information about epidemiology or microbiology bloodstream infection (BSI), study population and case definitions, exclusion criteria, narrative reviews, commentaries, case studies, pilot studies, study protocols, pediatric studies, and only clinical data (without microbiology or epidemiology) or studies with only one etiological factor analysis. The data review indicated the lack of an unequivocal, unified definition and no unambiguous basic criteria with regard to differentiation of EOS versus LOS. Among infants <1500 g, studies reported an EOS rate from 7% to 2%. For studies using other definitions (mostly all inborn babies), the rate of EOS ranged from 1% to 3%. The LOS incidences were much more varied among countries; the highest rates were in the multicenter studies focused on very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The main pathogens in EOS are GBS and Gram-negative bacteria in LOS. Our review data shows that LOS microbiology is very diverse and that Gram-positive cocci, especially staphylococci, predominate versus Gram-negative rods. Unfortunately, the lack of uniform, international prevention programs results in high newborn morbidity and insufficient postnatal prevention of late-onset infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31112766>Target identification and intervention strategies against amebiasis.</a></h2><p>Entamoeba histolytica is the etiological agent of amebiasis, which is an endemic parasitic disease in developing countries and is the cause of approximately 70,000 deaths annually. E. histolytica trophozoites usually reside in the colon as a non-pathogenic commensal in most infected individuals (90% of infected individuals are asymptomatic). For unknown reasons, these trophozoites can become virulent and invasive, cause amebic dysentery, and migrate to the liver where they cause hepatocellular damage. Amebiasis is usually treated either by amebicides which are classified as (a) luminal and are active against the luminal forms of the parasite, () tissue and are effective against those parasites that have invaded tissues, and (c) mixed and are effective against the luminal forms of the parasite and those forms which invaded the host's tissues. Of the amebicides, the luminal amebicide, metronidazole (MTZ), is the most widely used drug to treat amebiasis. Although well tolerated, concerns about its adverse effects and the possible emergence of MTZ-resistant strains of E. histolytica have led to the development of new therapeutic strategies against amebiasis. These strategies include improving the potency of existing amebicides, discovering new uses for approved drugs (repurposing of existing drugs), drug rediscovery, vaccination, drug targeting of essential E. histolytica components, and the use of  and bioactive natural products. This review examines each of these strategies in the light of the current knowledge on the gut microbiota of patients with amebiasis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Frequent recurrences have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high healthcare costs, and lower quality of life. In this review, we compare the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent rCDI. We performed a systematic review of the English literature, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated rCDI as an outcome. Studies were included irrespective of patient demographics, disease severity, type of intervention, comparator used, or time-point of outcome evaluation. We performed a comprehensive literature search with the assistance of a research librarian. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Our search yielded 38 RCTs (8,102 participants). Nineteen RCTs (3,743 subjects) evaluated antibiotics, eight fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) (582 subjects), three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (2,805 subjects), and eight , prebiotics, or non-antibiotic polymers (972 subjects). The antibiotic and FMT therapies that demonstrated efficacy in rCDI prevention included: fidaxomicin (when compared to a ten-day vancomycin course) and FMT administered by nasogastric tube (when compared to a fourteen-day vancomycin course and a fourteen-day vancomycin course plus bowel lavage). Actoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin A; CDA1) plus bezlotoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin ; CDB1) in combination or bezlotoxumab alone appeared to be more effective in preventing rCDI compared to actoxumab alone. Of the prebiotics, , and nonantibiotic polymers, oligofructose, Saccharomyces boulardii, and the nontoxigenic C. difficile strain M3 were the most efficacious for rCDI prevention. Thirty-eight RCTs (>8,000 participants) evaluating treatment modalities for CDI were examined for efficacy in prevention of rCDI. Several CDI-specific antibiotics, FMT modalities, monoclonal antibodies, and various prebiotics and  demonstrated a reduction in risk of rCDI with the greatest risk reduction observed with FMT and monoclonal antibody therapy. It is notable that the comparators in these studies were very different from one another and the relative risk reduction of rCDI may not be directly comparable from one study to the next.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Regulation of cytokine production by antigen-presenting cells might be critical for the anti-inflammatory function of LH2171 in autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanism and contributing components of LH2171-mediated inhibition of IL-6 production are unclear. Here, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of LH2171 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, as a model of antigen-presenting cells, necessary for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. LH2171 significantly reduced LPS-induced expression and secretion of IL-6 and IL-1β cytokines. It also inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa  and mitogen-activated protein kinases (NF-κ/MAPKs). Moreover, LH2171 induced gene expression of several negative regulators of NF-κ/MAPKs. Among these regulators, A20 was strongly up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels upon LH2171 treatment. The cell wall fraction of LH2171 also demonstrated a similar increase in A20 gene expression and exerted an anti-inflammatory effect. These results suggest that the cell wall may be one of the anti-inflammatory components of LH2171. Since cell wall components of Gram-positive bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effect of LH2171 was mediated by TLR2 signaling. Specifically, LH2171-mediated IL-6 suppression and A20 upregulation in wild-type macrophages were reversed and significantly reduced in TLR2 knock-out macrophages. These results suggest that LH2171 induces A20 expression via TLR2 signaling, inhibiting the activation of NF-κ/MAPKs and cytokine production in antigen-presenting cells. This might contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of LH2171 on autoimmune diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833358>A Putative Type V Pilus Contributes to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Biofilm Formation Capacity.</a></h2><p> is a prominent anaerobic member of the healthy human gut microbiota.

In these patients, prophylaxis may be considered to improve their quality of life and control overuse of antibiotics. Despite this need, there is currently no Latin American consensus on the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs. This consensus, signed by a panel of regional and international experts on UTI management, aims to address this need and is the first step toward a Latin American consensus on a number of urogynecological conditions. The panel agrees that antibiotics should be considered the primary treatment option for symptomatic UTI, taking into account local pathogen resistance patterns. Regarding prophylaxis, immunoactive therapy with the bacterial lysate OM-89 received a grade A recommendation and local estrogen in postmenopausal women grade  recommendation. Lower-grade recommendations include behavior modification and D-mannose;  (Lactobacilli), cranberries, and hyaluronic acid (and derivatives) received limited recommendations; their use should be discussed with the patient. Though considered effective and receiving grade A recommendation, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered only following prophylaxis with effective non-antimicrobial measures that were not successful and chosen based on the frequency of sexual intercourse and local pathogen resistance patterns.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31502382>Twice-a-day PPI, tetracycline, metronidazole quadruple therapy with Pylera® or Lactobacillus reuteri for treatment naïve or for retreatment of Helicobacter pylori.

A total of 360 Hy-Line Brown laying hens (72 weeks old) were divided into three groups with four replicates of 30 birds each. The laying hens were fed with the basal diet (Control), the basal diet + 3.75 · 10 cfu EF/kg (Group I) or the basal diet + 7.5 · 10 cfu EF/kg (Group II). The experiment lasted for 45 d. Eggs and caecal samples were collected at the end of the experiment. Results showed that dietary supplementation with EF did not affect the average daily egg weight, cracked egg rate, mortality and egg quality. However, EF supplementation caused a significantly increased laying rate and decreased feed/egg ratio (p < 0.05). The differences in caecal microbiota between Group II and the Control were significant. The relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia and Cyanobacteria at the phylum level, Rikenellaceae, Christensenellaceae and Veillonellaceae at the family level, and the Faecalibacterium, Christensenellaceae R-7 group and Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group at the genus level changed significantly in Group II compared with the Control (p < 0.05).

In Canada, universal screening for GBS colonization is offered to pregnant people at 35-37 weeks' gestation and those who test positive are offered intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP). Universal screening and treatment with IAP have not eradicated all cases of EOGBSD, and IAP has documented side effects.

Pregnant midwifery clients >18 years of age and <45 years of age and with a gestational age of <25 weeks at the time of enrolment were randomly assigned to receive two capsules of  ( GR-1 and  RC-14) or placebo orally daily for 12 weeks at 23-25 weeks' gestation. The primary aim was to determine the feasibility of a larger study. The rate of GBS vaginal/rectal colonization at 35-37 weeks' gestation was also assessed in both groups.  In total, 139 pregnant midwifery clients were randomized (probiotic group [ = 73] and placebo group [ = 66]). Of these, 113 were included in the final analysis (probiotic group [ = 57] and placebo group [ = 56]). Baseline characteristics between groups were similar with the exception of gestational age ( < .01). The recruitment rate was low at 12%, but the mean compliance rate was 87%. The eligibility/ineligibility criteria were too strict and changes to the study design will be required for the larger proposed study. The rates of vaginal/rectal GBS colonization did not differ significantly between groups (15.8 versus 21.43%;  = .48). No adverse effects were documented in the probiotic group.

Turmeric is one of the most important medicinal herbaceous that is derived from Curcuma longa rhizome. Curcumin is a well-recognized component of turmeric which contributes to the prevention of multiple inflammatory diseases. Despite curcumin as a well-known compound, few researches have focused on the turmeric extract (TE) and its potential as prebiotic and anti-inflammatory compound. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prebiotic potential and some functional-structural properties of TE. The Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum of TE showed identical peaks that belonged to β configuration in pyranose and glycosidic bonds. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed the presence of potent phenolic and flavonoid anti-oxidants and curcuminoids, and some functional monosaccharides. TE demonstrated excellent resistance to artificial human gastric and intestine juice compared to the standard prebiotic (inulin) (p ≤ 0.05). Interestingly, our time course experiment showed that TE not only is digested by  including Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Bifidobacterium animalis BB12, but also supports the growth of these bacteria even after 72 h (p ≤ 0.05).

Host responses to interventions that change their microbiota are largely uncharacterized. We applied a consortium of four natural antifungal bacteria to the skin of endangered Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs, Rana sierrae, before experimental exposure to the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). The probiotic microbes did not persist, nor did they protect hosts, and skin peptide sampling indicated immune modulation. We characterized a novel skin defense peptide brevinin-1Ma (FLPILAGLAANLVPKLICSITKKC) that was downregulated by the probiotic treatment. Brevinin-1Ma was tested against a range of amphibian skin cultures and found to inhibit growth of fungal pathogens Bd and . salamandrivorans, but enhanced the growth of probiotic bacteria including Janthinobacterium lividum, Chryseobacterium ureilyticum, Serratia grimesii, and Pseudomonas sp. While commonly thought of as antimicrobial peptides, here brevinin-1Ma showed promicrobial function, facilitating microbial growth. Thus, skin exposure to probiotic bacterial cultures induced a shift in skin defense peptide profiles that appeared to act as an immune response functioning to regulate the microbiome. In addition to direct microbial antagonism, probiotic-host interactions may be a critical mechanism affecting disease resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516055>Probiotic and cranberry supplementation for preventing recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in premenopausal women: a controlled pilot study.</a></h2><p>: To assess efficacy and safety of Bio-Kult Pro-Cyan (BKPro-Cyan), a product containing two strains of Lactobacilli plus cranberry extract, for preventing recurrent UTIs in pre-menopausal adult women.: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.

The inlAB operon was cloned and surface-expressed on L. casei resulting in a recombinant strain, Lbc  , and subsequently, its ability to inhibit adhesion, invasion and translocation of L. monocytogenes through enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells was examined. Cell surface expression of InlAB on the Lbc  was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. The Lbc  strain showed significantly higher (P < 0.0001) adherence, invasion and translocation of Caco-2 cells than the wild-type L. casei strain (Lbc ), as well as reduced L. monocytogenes adhesion, invasion and transcellular passage through the cell monolayer than Lbc . Furthermore, pre-exposure of Caco-2 cells to Lbc  significantly reduced L. monocytogenes-induced cell cytotoxicity and epithelial barrier dysfunction.
