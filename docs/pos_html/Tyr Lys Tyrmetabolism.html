PEG-peptides inhibit scavenger receptors in the liver by a novel mechanism involving in situ formation of albumin nanoparticles. The present study developed a new in vivo assay used to explore the structure-activity-relationships of PEG-peptides to find potent scavenger receptor inhibitors. Radio-iodinated PEG-peptides were dosed i.v. in mice and shown to saturate liver uptake in a dose-dependent fashion. The inhibition potency (IC) was dependent on both the length of a polylysine repeat and PEG molecular weight. PEG-Cys- was confirmed to be a high molecular weight (33.5 kDa) scavenger receptor inhibitor with an IC of 18 μM. Incorporation of multiple Leu residues improved potency, allowing a decrease in PEG MW and Lys repeat, resulting in PEG-Cys--(Leu-Lys)-Leu-Lys that inhibited scavenger receptors with an IC = 20 μM. A further decrease in PEG MW to 2 kDa increased potency further, resulting in a low molecular weight (4403 g/mol) PEG-peptide with an IC of 3 μM. Optimized low molecular weight PEG-peptides also demonstrated potency when inhibiting the uptake of radio-iodinated DNA nanoparticles by the liver. This study demonstrates an approach to discover low molecular weight PEG-peptides that serve as potent scavenger receptor inhibitors to block nanoparticle uptake by the liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25066364>Highly stable, fluorescence-labeled heptapeptides substituted with a D-amino acid for the specific detection of oxidized low-density lipoprotein in plasma.</a></h1><p>Probes that can detect oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) in plasma and in atherosclerotic plaques can be useful for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of atherosclerosis. Recently, we have reported that two heptapeptides (Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp, KP6) coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) through the ε-amino group of N-terminus Lys in the absence/presence of 6-amino-n-caproic acid (AC) linker to FITC-(FITC)KP6 and (FITC-AC)KP6-can be useful as fluorescent probes for the specific detection of ox-LDL. In this study, to develop the fluorescent peptides with high plasma stability for the specific detection of ox-LDL, we investigated the interaction of (FITC)KP6 and (FITC-AC)KP6 substituted with D-Lys at the N-terminus-(FITC)dKP6 and (FITC-AC)dKP6-with ox-LDL, and the in vitro stability of these peptides in mouse plasma. (FITC)dKP6 and (FITC-AC)dKP6 bound with high specificity to ox-LDL in a dose-dependent manner, and also to ox-LDL in the mouse plasma. Furthermore, (FITC)dKP6 was more stable than (FITC)KP6 in mouse plasma (102.1% versus 69.0% remained after 1 h). These findings strongly suggest that (FITC)dKP6 and (FITC-AC)dKP6 may be effective fluorescent probes with higher plasma stability than (FITC)KP6 and (FITC-AC)KP6 for the specific detection of ox-LDL.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29902001>New Insights into the Inhibition Mechanism of Betulinic Acid on α-Glucosidase.</a></h1><p>Betulinic acid (BA), an important pentacyclic triterpene widely distributed in many foods, possesses high antidiabetic activity. In this study, BA was found to exhibit stronger inhibition of α-glucosidase than acarbose with an IC value of (1.06 ± 0.02) × 10 mol L in a mixed-type manner. BA bound with α-glucosidase to form a BA-α-glucosidase complex, resulting in a more compact structure of the enzyme. The obtained concentrations and spectra profiles of the components resolved by the multivariate-curve resolution-alternating least-squares confirmed the formation of the BA-α-glucosidase complex. Molecular docking showed that BA tightly bound to the active cavity of α-glucosidase, which might hinder the entrance of the substrate leading to a decline in enzyme activity. The chemical modification of α-glucosidase verified the results of the computer simulation that the order of importance of the four amino acid residues in the binding process was His >  > Lys > Arg.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26868105>Structure of iridoid synthase in complex with NADP(+)/8-oxogeranial reveals the structural basis of its substrate specificity.</a></h1><p>Iridoid synthase (IS), as a vegetal enzyme belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, produces the ring skeletons for downstream alkaloids with various pharmaceutical activities, including the commercially available antineoplastic agents, vinblastine and vincristine. Here, we present the crystal structures of IS in apo state and in complex with NADP(+)/8-oxogeranial, exhibiting an active center that lacks the classical /Lys/Ser triad spatially conserved in SDRs, with only the catalytically critical function of triad tyrosine remained in Tyr178. In consistent, mutation of Tyr178 to a phenylalanine residue significantly abolished the catalytic activity of IS. Within the substrate binding pocket, the linear-shaped 8-oxogeranial adopts an entirely extended conformation with its two aldehyde ends hydrogen-bonded to Tyr178-OH and Ser349-OH, respectively. In addition, the intermediate carbon chain of bound substrate is harbored by a well-ordered hydrophobic scaffold, involving residues Ile145, Phe149, Leu203, Met213, Phe342, Ile345 and Leu352. Mutagenesis studies showed that both Ser349 and the hydrophobic residues around are determinant to the substrate specificity and, consequently, the catalytic activity of IS. In contrast, the Gly150-Pro160 loop previously proposed as a factor involved in substrate binding might have very limited contribution, because the deletion of residues Ile151-His161 has only slight influence on the catalytic activity. We believe that the present work will help to elucidate the substrate specificity of IS and to integrate its detailed catalytic mechanism.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We previously reported that synthetic biotinylated peptides having a -Asp-Gly sequence markedly inhibit PAF-induced  by direct binding, and that two synthetic fluorescence-labelled heptapeptides (Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp and D-Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp) with high stability in plasma specifically bind to PAF-like lipids (oxidized- and lyso-phosphatidylchoine). In this study, synthetic heptapeptides (Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp) coupled to a biotin molecule through the N-terminal amino group and ε-amino group of N-terminus Lys, (Btn)KP6 and K(Btn)P6, respectively, and their biotinylated peptides substituted with D-Lys at the N-terminus, (Btn)dKP6 and dK(Btn)P6, respectively, were investigated for their effects on PAF-induced . In the experiments using a rat model of hind paw oedema, (Btn)KP6, K(Btn)P6, (Btn)dKP6, and dK(Btn)P6 significantly inhibited PAF-induced paw oedema, with the highest inhibitory effect exhibited by dK(Btn)P6. The inhibitory effect of D--D-Lys-D-Asp-Gly tetrapeptide on PAF-induced paw oedema was much lower than that of -Asp-Gly tetrapeptide. In the experiments using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, (Btn)KP6, K(Btn)P6, (Btn)dKP6, and dK(Btn)P6 bound to PAF dose-dependently, with dK(Btn)P6 showing the strongest binding affinity, indicating that its affinity appears to be closely correlated with its inhibitory effect on PAF-induced . These results suggest that direct binding of (Btn)KP6, K(Btn)P6, (Btn)dKP6, and dK(Btn)P6 to PAF can lead to marked inhibition of PAF-induced , and these agents, particularly dK(Btn)P6, may be useful as anti-inflammatory drugs targeting PAF with high stability in plasma.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The studies presented in this paper, when compared with our previous results (Makowska et al., Spectrochim. Acta A 153: 451-456), show that the affinity of the peptide to metal ions is conformation-dependent. All the measurements were carried out in 20mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer solution, pH6.0. The Stern-Volmer equations, along with spectroscopic observations, were used to determine the quenching and binding parameters. The obtained results unequivocally suggest that Cu(2+) ions quench the fluorescence of HZ1 only through a static quenching mechanism, in contrast to the fragment from the N-terminal part of the FPB28 protein, with sequence Ac--Thr-Ala-Asp-Gly-Lys-Thr-- NH2 (D9) and its derivative with a single point mutation: Ac--Thr-Ala-Asn-Gly-Lys-Thr-- NH2 (D9_M), where dynamic quenching occurred. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔITCH, ΔITCS) for the interactions between Cu(2+) ions and the HZ1 peptide were determined from the calorimetric data. The conditional thermodynamic parameters suggest that, under the experimental conditions, the formation of the Cu(2+)-HZ1 complex is both an enthalpy and entropy driven process.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A bifunctional chelate that can effectively complex with the radioisotopes is a critical component for molecular targeted radiotherapy (90)Y and (177)Lu. A new bifunctional chelate 5p-C-NETA with a relatively long alkyl spacer between the chelating backbone and the functional unit for conjugation to a tumor targeting moiety was synthesized. 5p-C-NETA was conjugated to a model targeting moiety, a cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-D- (RGDyK) peptide binding integrin αvβ3 protein overexpressed on various cancers. 5p-C-NETA was conjugated to c(RGDyK) peptide and evaluated for potential use in molecular targeted radiotherapy of (90)Y and (177)Lu.5p-C-NETA conjugated with c(RGDyK) was evaluated in vitro for radiolabeling, serum stability, binding affinity, and the result of the in vitro studies of 5p-C-NETA-c(RGDyK) was compared to that of 3p-C-NETA-c(RGDyK). (177)Lu-5p-C-NETA-c(RGDyK) was further evaluated for in vivo biodistribution using gliobastoma bearing mice.The new chelate rapidly and tightly bound to a cytotoxic radioisotope for cancer therapy, (90)Y or (177)Lu with excellent radiolabeling efficiency and maximum specific activity under mild condition (>99%, RT, <1 min). (90)Y- and (177)Lu-radiolabeled complexes of the new chelator remained stable in human serum without any loss of the radiolanthanide for 14 days. Introduction of the tumor targeting RGD moiety to the new chelator made little impact on complexation kinetics and stability with (90)Y or (177)Lu. (177)Lu-radiolabeled 5p-C-NETA-c(RGDyK) conjugate was shown to target tumors in mice and produced a favorable in vivo stability profile.The results of in vitro and in vivo evaluation suggest that 5p-C-NETA is an effective bifunctional chelate of (90)Y and (177)Lu that can be applied for generation of versatile molecular targeted radiopharmaceuticals.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we demonstrate a zwitterionic biodegradable cross-linked micelle based on a penta-block copolymer, which utilizes poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) as hydrophilic segment, poly(ε-caprolactone) as biodegradable hydrophobic segment, poly(S-2-hydroxyethyl-O-ethyl dithiocarbonate methacrylate) (PSODMA) block as thiol protecting segment for cross-linking, and cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-d- [c(RGDyK)] as targeting ligand. As a result, this micelle possessed excellent colloidal stability at high dilution and in 50% fetal bovine serum. In vitro drug release experiment showed no burst release under physiological conditions but accelerated drug release in mimicking tumor tissue environment. In vivo tests showed that the drug-loaded micelles had prolonged half-life in bloodstream, enhanced therapeutic efficiency, and reduced cardiac toxicity and biotoxicity compared with free drug formulation. Taken together, the reported c(RGDyK)-modified zwitterionic interfacially cross-linked micelle has emerged as an appealing platform for cancer therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29776313>Bioinspired thermoresponsive nanoscaled coatings: Tailor-made polymer brushes with bioconjugated arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-peptides.</a></h1><p>The development of bioengineered surface coatings with stimuli-responsive properties is beneficial for a number of biomedical applications. Environmentally responsive and switchable polymer brush systems have a great potential to create such smart biointerfaces. This study focuses on the bioconjugation of cell-instructive peptides, containing the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid tripeptide sequence (RGD motif), onto well-defined polymer brush films. Herein, the highly tailored end-grafted homo polymer brushes are either composed of the polyelectrolyte poly(acrylic) acid (PAA), providing the reactive carboxyl functionalities, or of the temperature-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm). Of particular interest is the preparation of grafted-to binary brushes using both polymers and their subsequent conversion to RGD-biofunctionalized PNIPAAm-PAA binary brushes by a carbodiimide conjugation method. The bioconjugation process of two linear RGD-peptides Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser and Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Lys and one cyclic RGD-peptide cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-) is comparatively investigated by complementary analysis methods. Both techniques, in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements and the in situ spectroscopic ellipsometric analysis, describe changes of the brush surface properties due to biofunctionalization. Besides, the bound RGD-peptide amount is quantitatively evaluated by ellipsometry in comparison to high performance liquid chromatography analysis data. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations of the RGD-peptides themselves allow a better understanding of the bioconjugation process depending on the peptide properties. The significant influence on the bioconjugation result can be derived, on the one hand, of the polymer brush composition, especially from the PNIPAAm content, and, on the other hand, of the peptide dimension and its reactivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27725385>Development of Novel Diagnostic Agents for Atherosclerosis Using Fluorescence-labeled Peptides.</a></h1><p>The oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Therefore, probes for detection of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) in atherosclerotic plaques and plasma are expected to be useful for the diagnosis of atherosclerosis. Recently, we found that four fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled heptapeptides (Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp, KP6)-(FITC)KP6 and (FITC-AC)KP6- and then substitution with D-Lys at the N-terminus-(FITC)dKP6 and (FITC-AC)dKP6- bind with high specificity and high affinity to two oxidized forms of LDL, heavily oxidized LDL and minimally modified LDL (MM-LDL), through binding to lysophosphatidylcholine and oxidized phosphatidylcholine, present abundantly in heavily oxidized LDL and MM-LDL. Moreover, (FITC)dKP6 and (FITC-AC)dKP6 were more stable than (FITC)KP6 and (FITC-AC)KP6 in plasma in vitro. (FITC)KP6 could detect foam cells in atherosclerotic aortic plaques of apoE-knockout mice. These results suggest that four fluorescence-labeled heptapeptides could be efficient fluorescent probes for the specific detection of ox-LDL, and can therefore contribute to the identification, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28860479>De novo design of antibody complementarity determining regions binding a FLAG tetra-peptide.</a></h1><p>Computational antibody engineering efforts to date have focused on improving binding affinities or biophysical characteristics. De novo design of antibodies binding specific epitopes could greatly accelerate discovery of therapeutics as compared to conventional immunization or synthetic library selection strategies. Here, we employed de novo complementarity determining region (CDR) design to engineer targeted antibody-antigen interactions using previously described in silico methods. CDRs predicted to bind the minimal FLAG peptide (Asp--Asp) were grafted onto a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) acceptor framework. Fifty scFvs comprised of designed heavy and light or just heavy chain CDRs were synthesized and screened for peptide binding by phage ELISA. Roughly half of the designs resulted in detectable scFv expression. Four antibodies, designed entirely in silico, bound the minimal FLAG sequence with high specificity and sensitivity. When reformatted as soluble antigen-binding fragments (Fab), these clones expressed well, were predominantly monomeric and retained peptide specificity. In both formats, the antibodies bind the peptide only when present at the amino-terminus of a carrier protein and even conservative peptide amino acid substitutions resulted in a complete loss of binding. These results support in silico CDR design of antibody specificity as an emerging antibody engineering strategy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27699916>Design of peptidase-resistant peptide inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase.</a></h1><p>Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is a key regulator of various forms of cell motility including smooth muscle contraction, cell migration, cytokinesis, receptor capping, secretion, etc. Inhibition of MLCK activity in endothelial and epithelial monolayers using cell-permeant peptide Arg-Lys-Lys---Arg-Arg-Lys (PIK, Peptide Inhibitor of Kinase) allows protecting the barrier capacity, suggesting a potential medical use of PIK. However, low stability of L-PIK in a biological milieu prompts for development of more stable L-PIK analogues for use as experimental tools in basic and drug-oriented biomedical research. Previously, we designed PIK1, H-(N Me)Arg-Lys-Lys---Arg-Arg-Lys-NH , that was 2.5-fold more resistant to peptidases in human plasma in vitro than L-PIK and equal to it as MLCK inhibitor. In order to further enhance proteolytic stability of PIK inhibitor, we designed the set of six site-protected peptides based on L-PIK and PIK1 degradation patterns in human plasma as revealed by  H-NMR analysis. Implemented modifications increased half-live of the PIK-related peptides in plasma about 10-fold, and these compounds retained 25-100% of L-PIK inhibitory activity toward MLCK in vitro. Based on stability and functional activity ranking, PIK2, H-(N Me)Arg-Lys-Lys---Arg-D-Arg-Lys-NH , was identified as the most stable and effective L-PIK analogue. PIK2 was able to decrease myosin light chain phosphorylation in endothelial cells stimulated with thrombin, and this effect correlated with the inhibition by PIK2 of thrombin-induced endothelial hyperpermeability in vitro. Therefore, PIK2 could be used as novel alternative to other cell-permeant inhibitors of MLCK in cell culture-based and in vivo studies where MLCK catalytic activity inhibition is required.Copyright © 2016 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28687985>A Method for In Vitro Measurement of Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein in Blood, Using Its Antibody, Fluorescence-Labeled Heptapeptide and Polyethylene Glycol.</a></h1><p>Two oxidized forms of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), oxidized (Ox-LDL) and minimally modified (MM-LDL), and the immune complexes (LDL-ICs) that they form with their corresponding antibodies, play a major role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Recently, we reported that the heptapeptide KP6 (Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp) coupled through its ε-amino group present on the N-terminal Lys to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- (FITC)KP6- binds specifically to Ox-LDL and MM-LDL, but not to native LDL. Here, to develop a novel method for measuring the levels of oxidatively modified LDL in blood, using (FITC)KP6, we analyzed the latter's binding with MM-LDL-IC and Ox-LDL-IC. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that (FITC)KP6 could efficiently and specifically bind to polyethylene glycol (PEG)-precipitated MM-LDL-IC and Ox-LDL-IC in a dose-dependent manner with high sensitivity in plasma and serum. Our results indicate that the above method for measuring the levels of PEG-precipitated, oxidatively modified LDL-ICs, formed by the addition of anti-Ox-LDL antibody to blood, using (FITC)KP6, can aid the diagnosis of atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27743211>Evaluation of a Flexible NOTA-RGD Kit Solution Using Gallium-68 from Different Ge/Ga-Generators: Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution in Nonhuman Primates and Demonstration of Solitary Pulmonary Nodule Imaging in Humans.</a></h1><p>Radiopharmaceuticals containing the motive tripeptide arginyl-glycyl-asparatic acid (RGD) are known to target ανβ3 integrins during tumor angiogenesis. A more generic kit radiolabeling procedure accommodating Ga-68 from different generators was developed for NOTA-RGD and evaluated for its versatile use and safety in subsequent in vivo applications. The [Ga]NOTA-RGD kit was further verified for its expected biodistribution and pharmacokinetics in nonhuman primates and its clinical sensitivity to detect solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) in cancer patients.Single vial kits containing 28-56 nmol of NOTA-cyclo-Arg-Gly-Asp-d- (NOTA-RGD) and sodium acetate trihydrate buffer were formulated. Versatility of the NOTA-RGD radiolabeling performance and adaption to a TiO- and a SnO-based generator type, characterization and long-term storage stability of the kits were carried out. The blood clearance and urine recovery kinetics as well as the image-guided biodistribution of [Ga]NOTA-RGD was studied in a vervet monkey model. [Ga]NOTA-RGD kits were further tested clinically to target solitary pulmonary nodules.The kits could be successfully formulated warranting integrity over 3-4 months with a good [Ga]NOTA-RGD radiolabeling performance (radiochemical purity >95 %, decay corrected yield 76-94 %, specific activity of 8.8-37.9 GBq/μmol) The kits met all quality requirements to be further tested in vivo. [Ga]NOTA-RGD cleared rapidly from blood and was majorly excreted via the renal route. The liver, spleen, heart and intestines showed initial uptake with steadily declining tissue activity concentration over time. In addition, the [Ga]NOTA-RGD kit allowed for delineation of SPN from non-malignant lung tissue in humans.A more versatile radiolabeling procedure using kit-formulated NOTA-RGD and different generator types was achieved. The uncompromised in vivo behavior and efficient targeting of SPN warrants further investigations on the clinical relevance of [Ga]NOTA-RGD derivatives to implement initial guidelines and management of patients, with regard to integrin targeted imaging.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25681283>Pharmacological profile of a bifunctional ligand of the formyl peptide receptor1 fused to the myc epitope.</a></h1><p>In human peripheral blood neutrophils or in myeloid PLB-985 cells differentiated towards a neutrophil-like phenotype, the peptide N-formyl-L-norleucyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-norleucyl-L-tyrosyl-L-leucyl-fluorescein isothiocyanate (f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--FITC) binds to and activates formyl peptide receptor1 (FPR1) and is submitted to receptor-mediated endocytosis (microscopy, cytofluorometry). This peptide may be considered a C-terminally extended version of f-Met-Leu-Phe which carries a fluorescent cargo into cells. By analogy to other peptide hormones for which we have evaluated epitope-tagged agonists as carriers of antibody cargoes, we have designed and evaluated f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--myc, C-terminally extended with the 10-residue myc tag. This peptide is as potent as f-Met-Leu-Phe to compete for f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--FITC uptake by PLB-985 cells, but did not mediate (10-1000nM) the internalization of the fluorescent anti-myc monoclonal antibody 4A6 added to the extracellular fluid at ~7nM (microscopy). The nonfluorescent version of the antibody (28nM) acts as a pre-receptor antagonist of f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--myc, but not of f-Met-Leu-Phe (superoxide release assay in differentiated PLB-985 cells). A further prolonged analog, f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--(Asn-Gly)5-myc, designed to decrease the possible steric hindrance between FPR1 and the bound anti-myc antibody, has little affinity for the receptor, precluding a direct assessment of this issue. Thus, the relatively low-affinity anti-myc antibody used at a high concentration functionally behaves as a selective pre-receptor antagonist of the agonist f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--myc.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Nine subfractions were obtained after sequential purification by ultrafiltration, Sephadex G-25 gel (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) filtration chromatography, and preparative HPLC. Among them, subfraction F4e showed the strongest inhibitory activity on interleukin-1β (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA expression in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. Eight peptides, including 2 new peptides-Asp--Lys- (DYKKY) and Asp-Gln-Trp-Leu (DQWL)-were identified from subfractions F4c and F4e, respectively, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Peptide DQWL showed the strongest inhibitory ability on IL-1β, cyclooxygenase-2, and TNF-α mRNA expression and production of IL-1β and TNF-α proteins at concentrations of 10 and 100μg/mL, respectively. Additionally, DQWL treatment significantly inhibited nuclear factor-κB activation by suppressing nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB p65 and blocking inhibitor κB kinase phosphorylation and inhibitor κB degradation together with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Our study suggests that peptide DQWL has anti-inflammatory potential; further confirmation using an in vivo model is needed.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Data from 25 papers, published from 1995 to 2018, for a total of 44 trials and 210 observations were recorded in a database. Diets were reformulated using the NRC (2012) loading values to estimate nutrient concentrations. The response variables were average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F). The predictor variables tested included average body weight (BW), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, Ile:Lys, Leu:Lys, Val:Lys, BCAA:Lys, Ile:Leu, Val:Leu, Ile:Val, (Ile+Val):Leu, Trp:Lys, Leu:Trp, Ile:Trp, Val:Trp, BCAA:Trp, Met:Lys, Leu:Met, Ile:Met, Val:Met, BCAA:Met, His:Lys, Leu:His, Ile:His, Val:His, BCAA:His, Thr:Lys, Leu:Thr, Ile:Thr, Val:Thr, BCAA:Thr, (Phe+):Lys, Leu:(Phe+), Ile:(Phe+), Val:(Phe+), BCAA:(Phe+), LNAA:Lys, Leu:LNAA, Ile:LNAA, Val:LNAA, and BCAA:LNAA.

The inverse of squared SEM was used to account for heterogeneous errors using the WEIGHT statement. Models were selected with a step-wise manual forward selection. In order to be included in the final model, predictor variables had to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) and provide an improvement of at least 2 points in Bayesian information criterion. The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:Lys) + (20.2659 × Ile:Lys) - (0.1479 × Ile:Lys × Ile:Lys) + (9.2243 × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.03321 × (Ile+Val):Leu × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.4413 × Ile:Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × Ile:Lys) + (1.7284 × Val:Lys) - (0.00795 × Val:Lys × Val:Lys) - (1.7594 × Met:Lys); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu:Lys negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of Val, Ile, and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.

Therefore, FPR1 is an important therapeutic target for drugs to treat septic or sterile inflammatory diseases. Honokiol, a major bioactive compound of Magnoliaceae plants, possesses several anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we show that honokiol exhibits an inhibitory effect on FPR1 binding in human neutrophils. Honokiol inhibited superoxide anion generation, reactive oxygen species formation, and elastase release in bacterial or mitochondrial N-formyl peptides (FPR1 agonists)-activated human neutrophils. Adhesion of FPR1-induced human neutrophils to cerebral endothelial cells was also reduced by honokiol. The receptor-binding results revealed that honokiol repressed FPR1-specific ligand N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--fluorescein binding to FPR1 in human neutrophils, neutrophil-like THP-1 cells, and hFPR1-transfected HEK293 cells. However, honokiol did not inhibit FPR2-specific ligand binding to FPR2 in human neutrophils. Furthermore, honokiol inhibited FPR1 agonist-induced calcium mobilization as well as phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK in human neutrophils. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that honokiol may have therapeutic potential for treating FPR1-mediated inflammatory diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29602217>A fluorescently labeled undecapeptide derived from a protein in royal jelly of the honeybee-royalisin-for specific detection of oxidized low-density lipoprotein.</a></h1><p>The probes for detection of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) in plasma and in atherosclerotic plaques are expected to facilitate the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of atherosclerosis. Recently, we have reported that a heptapeptide (Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp, KP6) coupled through the ε-amino group of N-terminal Lys to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), (FITC)KP6, can be useful as a fluorescent probe for specific detection of ox-LDL. In the present study, to develop a novel fluorescent peptide for specific detection of ox-LDL, we investigated the interaction (with ox-LDL) of an undecapeptide corresponding to positions 41 to 51 of a potent antimicrobial protein (royalisin, which consists of 51 residues; from royal jelly of honeybees), conjugated at the N-terminus to FITC in the presence of 6-amino-n-caproic acid (AC) linker, (FITC-AC)-royalisin P11, which contains both sequences, Phe-Lys-Asp and Asp-Lys-, similar to -Asp in (FITC)KP6. The (FITC-AC)-royalisin P11 bound with high specificity to ox-LDL in a dose-dependent manner, through the binding to major lipid components in ox-LDL (lysophosphatidylcholine and oxidized phosphatidylcholine). In contrast, a (FITC-AC)-shuffled royalisin P11 peptide, in which sequences Phe-Lys-Asp and Asp-Lys- were modified to Lys-Phe-Asp and Asp-, respectively, hardly bound to LDL and ox-LDL. These findings strongly suggest that (FITC-AC)-royalisin P11 may be an effective fluorescent probe for specific detection of ox-LDL and that royalisin from the royal jelly of honeybees may play a role in the treatment of atherosclerosis through the specific binding of the region at positions 41 to 51 to ox-LDL.Copyright © 2018 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27494406>FITC Conjugation Markedly Enhances Hepatic Clearance of N-Formyl Peptides.</a></h1><p>In both septic and aseptic , N-formyl peptides may enter the circulation and induce a systemic inflammatory response syndrome similar to that observed during septic shock. The inflammatory response is brought about by the binding of N-formyl peptide to formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), specific signaling receptors expressed on myeloid as well as non-myeloid cells involved in the inflammatory process. N-formyl peptides conjugated with fluorochromes, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) are increasingly experimentally used to identify tissues involved in . Hypothesizing that the process of FITC-conjugation may transfer formyl peptide to a ligand that is efficiently cleared from the circulation by the natural powerful hepatic scavenging regime we studied the biodistribution of intravenously administered FITC-fNLPNTL (Fluorescein-isothiocyanate- N-Formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-) in mice. Our findings can be summarized as follows: i) In contrast to unconjugated fNLPNTL, FITC-fNLPNTL was rapidly taken up in the liver; ii) Mouse and human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatocytes express formyl peptide receptor 1 (FRP1) on both mRNA (PCR) and protein (Western blot) levels; iii) Immunohistochemistry showed that mouse and human liver sections expressed FRP1 in LSECs and hepatocytes; and iv) Uptake of FITC-fNLPNTL could be largely blocked in mouse and human hepatocytes by surplus-unconjugated fNLPNTL, thereby suggesting that the hepatocytes in both species recognized FITC-fNLPNTL and fNLPNTL as indistinguishable ligands. This was in contrast to the mouse and human LSECs, in which the uptake of FITC-fNLPNTL was mediated by both FRP1 and a scavenger receptor, specifically expressed on LSECs. Based on these results we conclude that a significant proportion of FITC-fNLPNTL is taken up in LSECs via a scavenger receptor naturally expressed in these cells. This calls for great caution when using FITC-fNLPNTL and other chromogen-conjugated formyl peptides as a probe to identify cells in a liver engaged in . Moreover, our finding emphasizes the role of the liver as an important neutralizer of otherwise strong inflammatory signals such as formyl peptides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25955122>Hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles for tumor vasculature targeting and PET image-guided drug delivery.</a></h1><p>Development of multifunctional and well-dispersed hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs) for tumor vasculature targeted drug delivery and PET imaging.Amine functionalized HMSNs (150-250 nm) were conjugated with a macrocyclic chelator, (S)-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triaceticacid (NOTA), PEGylated and loaded with antiangiogenesis drug, Sunitinib. Cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-) (cRGDyK) peptide was attached to the nanoconjugate and radiolabeled with (64)Cu for PET imaging.(64)Cu-NOTA-HMSN-PEG-cRGDyK exhibited integrin-specific uptake both in vitro and in vivo. PET results indicated approximately 8% ID/g uptake of targeted nanoconjugates in U87MG tumors, which correlated well with ex vivo and histological analyses. Enhanced tumor-targeted delivery of sunitinib was also observed.We successfully developed tumor vasculature targeted HMSNs for PET imaging and image-guided drug delivery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27063871>A Fluorescence-Labeled Heptapeptide, (FITC)KP6, as an Efficient Probe for the Specific Detection of Oxidized and Minimally Modified Low-Density Lipoprotein.</a></h1><p>Two oxidized forms of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) and minimally modified LDL (MM-LDL), are believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Recently, we reported that a heptapeptide (Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp, KP6) coupled through the ε-amino group of N-terminus Lys to fluorescein isothiocyanate, (FITC)KP6, bound to ox-LDL but not to LDL. In the present study, we investigated whether (FITC)KP6 could be used as a fluorescent probe for the specific detection of MM-LDL and ox-LDL. Results from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and surface plasmon resonance proved that (FITC)KP6 could efficiently bind to MM-LDL as well as ox-LDL in a dose-dependent manner and with high affinity (K D = 3.16 and 3.54 ng/mL protein for MM-LDL and ox-LDL, respectively). (FITC) KP6 bound to lysophosphatidylcholine and oxidized phosphatidylcholine, both present abundantly in ox-LDL and MM-LDL, respectively. In vitro, (FITC)KP6 was detected on the surface and/or in the cytosol of human THP-1-derived macrophages incubated with ox-LDL and MM-LDL, but not LDL. These results suggest that (FITC)KP6 could be an efficient fluorescent probe for the specific detection of ox-LDL and MM-LDL and can therefore contribute to the identification, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363471>Binding of Cu(II) ions to peptides studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry.</a></h1><p>Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence quenching measurements supported by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) were used to study the interactions of Cu(2+) with four peptides. Two of them were taken from the N-terminal part of the FBP28 protein (formin binding protein) WW domain: -Thr-Ala-Asp-Gly-Lys-Thr--NH2 (D9) and its mutant -Thr-Ala-Asn-Gly-Lys-Thr--NH2 (D9_M) as well as two mutated peptides from the B3 domain of the immunoglobulin binding protein G derived from Streptococcus: Asp-Val-Ala-Thr--Thr-NH2 (J1) and Glu-Val-Ala-Thr--Thr-NH2 (J2). The measurements were carried out at 298.15K in 20mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer solution with a pH of 6. The fluorescence of all peptides was quenched by Cu(2+) ions. The stoichiometry, conditional stability constants and thermodynamic parameters for the interactions of the Cu(2+) ions with D9 and D9_M were determined from the calorimetric data. The values of the conditional stability constants were additionally determined from fluorescence quenching measurements and compared with those obtained from calorimetric studies. There was a good correlation between data obtained from the two techniques. On the other hand, the studies revealed that J1 and J2 do not exhibit an affinity towards metal ions. The obtained results prove that fluorescence quenching experiments may be successfully used in order to determine stability constants of complexes with fluorescent ligands. Finally, based on the obtained results, the coordinating properties of the peptides towards the Cu(2+) ions are discussed.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
