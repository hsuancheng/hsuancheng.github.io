Improving the animal models is fundamental to overcoming this translational gap. To address this need, we developed and comprehensively characterized a new  model based on the orthotopic implantation of CT-2A cells cultured in neurospheres (NS/CT-2A). Murine CT-2A methylcholanthrene-induced HGG cells (C57BL/6 background) were cultured in monolayers (ML) or NS and orthotopically inoculated in syngeneic animals. ML/CT-2A and NS/CT-2A tumors' characterization included the analysis of tumor growth, immune microenvironment, glioma stem cells (GSCs), vascularization and metabolites. The immuno-modulating properties of NS/CT-2A and ML/CT-2A cells on splenocytes were tested  Mice harboring NS/CT-2A tumors had a shorter survival than those harboring ML/CT-2A tumors (=0.0033). Compared to standard ML/CT-2A tumors, NS/CT-2A tumors showed more abundant GSCs (=0.0002 and 0.0770 for Nestin and CD133, respectively) and regulatory T cells (Tregs, =0.0074), and a strong tendency towards an increased vascularization (=0.0503). There were no significant differences in metabolites' composition between NS/ and ML/CT-2A tumors. , NS were able to drive splenocytes towards a more immunosuppressive status by reducing CD8 T cells (=0.0354) and by promoting Tregs (=0.0082), macrophages (MF, =0.0019) and their  subset (=0.0536). Compared to standard ML/CT-2A tumors, NS/CT-2A tumors show a more aggressive phenotype with increased immunosuppression and GSCs proliferation. Because of these specific features, the NS/CT-2A model represents a clinically relevant platform in the search for new HGG treatments aimed at reducing immunosuppression and eliminating GSCs.© 2019.

Cirrhosis is a major cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality. Macrophages play a key role in fibrosis progression and reversal. However, the signals that determine fibrogenic vs fibrolytic macrophage function remain ill defined. We studied the role of interleukin-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα), a potential central switch of macrophage polarization, in liver fibrosis progression and reversal. We demonstrate that inflammatory monocyte infiltration and liver fibrogenesis were suppressed in general IL-4Rα as well as in macrophage-specific IL-4Rα (IL-4Rα) mice. However, with deletion of IL-4Rα spontaneous fibrosis reversal was retarded. Results were replicated by pharmacological intervention using IL-4Rα-specific antisense oligonucleotides. Retarded resolution was linked to the loss of -type resident macrophages, which secreted MMP-12 through IL-4 and IL-13-mediated phospho-STAT6 activation. We conclude that IL-4Rα signaling regulates macrophage functional polarization in a context-dependent manner. Pharmacological targeting of macrophage polarization therefore requires disease stage-specific treatment strategies.Alternative (-type) macrophage activation through IL-4Rα promotes liver inflammation and fibrosis progression but speeds up fibrosis reversal. This demonstrates context dependent, opposing roles of -type macrophages. During reversal IL-4Rα induces fibrolytic MMPs, especially MMP-12, through STAT6. Liver-specific antisense oligonucleotides efficiently block IL-4Rα expression and attenuate fibrosis progression.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Although both have documented roles in prostate carcinoma and many cancer types, the weak immunogenicity of these peptides has remained a major challenge for use in . Here, we describe a novel strategy to inhibit GnRH and VEGF production and assess the effect on the immune responses against these hormones using the RM-1 prostate cancer model. We designed a novel recombinant fusion protein which combined GnRH and VEGF as a vaccine against this tumor. The newly constructed fusion protein hVEGF121--GnRH3-hinge-MVP contains the human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF121) and three copies of GnRH in sequential linear alignment and T helper epitope MVP as an immunogenic vaccine. The effectiveness of the vaccine in eliciting an immune response and attenuating the prostate tumor growth was evaluated. Results showed that administration of a new vaccine effectively elicited humoral and cellular immune responses. We found that, a novel fusion protein, hVEGF121--GnRH3-hinge-MVP, effectively inhibited growth of RM-1 prostate model and effectively promoted immune response. In conclusion, hVEGF121--GnRH3-hinge-MVP is an effective dual mechanism tumor vaccine that limits RM-1 prostate growth. This vaccine may be a promising strategy for the treatment of hormone refractory prostate malignancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717773> of triple-negative breast cancer with cathepsin D-targeting antibodies.</a></h2><p>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment is currently restricted to chemotherapy. Hence, tumor-specific molecular targets and/or alternative therapeutic strategies for TNBC are urgently needed.  is emerging as an exciting treatment option for TNBC patients. The aspartic protease cathepsin D (cath-D), a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer (BC), is overproduced and hypersecreted by human BC cells. This study explores whether cath-D is a tumor cell-associated extracellular biomarker and a potent target for antibody-based therapy in TNBC.Cath-D prognostic value and localization was evaluated by transcriptomics, proteomics and immunohistochemistry in TNBC. First-in-class anti-cath-D human scFv fragments binding to both human and mouse cath-D were generated using phage display and cloned in the human IgG1 λ format (F1 and E2). Anti-cath-D antibody biodistribution, antitumor efficacy and in vivo underlying mechanisms were investigated in TNBC MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts in nude mice. Antitumor effect was further assessed in TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs).High CTSD mRNA levels correlated with shorter recurrence-free survival in TNBC, and extracellular cath-D was detected in the tumor microenvironment, but not in matched normal breast stroma. Anti-cath-D F1 and E2 antibodies accumulated in TNBC MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts, inhibited tumor growth and improved mice survival without apparent toxicity. The Fc function of F1, the best antibody candidate, was essential for maximal tumor inhibition in the MDA-MB-231 model. Mechanistically, F1 antitumor response was triggered through natural killer cell activation via IL-15 upregulation, associated with granzyme B and perforin production, and the release of antitumor IFNγ cytokine. The F1 antibody also prevented the tumor recruitment of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages  and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, a specific effect associated with a less immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment highlighted by TGFβ decrease. Finally, the antibody F1 inhibited tumor growth of two TNBC PDXs, isolated from patients resistant or not to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.Cath-D is a tumor-specific extracellular target in TNBC suitable for antibody-based therapy. Immunomodulatory antibody-based strategy against cath-D is a promising  to treat patients with TNBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29707588>Development of Safe and Non-Self-Immunogenic Mucosal Adjuvant by Recombinant Fusion of Cholera Toxin A1 Subunit with Protein Transduction Domain.</a></h2><p>Potential use of cholera toxin (CT) as a mucosal vaccine adjuvant has been documented in a variety of animal models. However, native CT is highly toxic to be used as a mucosal adjuvant in humans. Here, we demonstrate a new approach to generate a mucosal adjuvant by replacing the B subunit of CT with HIV-1 Tat protein transduction domain (PTD), which efficiently delivers fusion proteins into the cell cytoplasm by unspecific binding to cell surface. We compared the adjuvanticity and toxicity of Tat PTD-CTA1-Tat PTD (TCTA1T) with those of CT. Our results indicate that intranasal (i.n.) delivery of ovalbumin (OVA) with TCTA1T significantly augments the OVA-specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses to levels comparable to those seen with CT adjuvant. Moreover,  cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity elicited by TCTA1T was significantly higher than that elicited by a mutant TCTA1T (TmCTA1T) lacking ADP-ribosyltransferase function. In addition, coadministration of influenza  protein with TCTA1T conferred near complete protection against lethal influenza virus challenge. Importantly, TCTA1T, in contrast to CT, did not induce serum IgG antibody responses to itself and was shown to be nontoxic. These results suggest that TCTA1T may be a safe and effective adjuvant when given by mucosal routes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31031765>Complementing the Cancer-Immunity Cycle.</a></h2><p>Reactivation of cytotoxic CD8 T-cell responses has set a new direction for cancer . Neutralizing antibodies targeting immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) have been particularly successful for tumor types with limited therapeutic options such as melanoma and lung cancer. However, reactivation of T cells is only one step toward tumor elimination, and a substantial fraction of patients fails to respond to these therapies. In this context, combination therapies targeting more than one of the steps of the cancer-immune cycle may provide significant benefits. To find the best combinations, it is of upmost importance to understand the interplay between cancer cells and all the components of the immune response. This review focuses on the elements of the complement system that come into play in the cancer-immunity cycle. The complement system, an essential part of innate immunity, has emerged as a major regulator of cancer immunity. Complement effectors such as C1q, anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and their receptors C3aR and C5aR1, have been associated with tolerogenic cell death and inhibition of antitumor T-cell responses through the recruitment and/or activation of immunosuppressive cell subpopulations such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), or  tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Evidence is provided to support the idea that complement blocks many of the effector routes associated with the cancer-immunity cycle, providing the rationale for new therapeutic combinations aimed to enhance the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802149>Dual blockade of CXCL12-CXCR4 and PD-1-PD-L1 pathways prolongs survival of ovarian tumor-bearing mice by prevention of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Blockade of immune-checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 can enhance effector T-cell responses. However, the lack of response in many patients to checkpoint-inhibitor therapies emphasizes the need for combination immunotherapies to pursue maximal antitumor efficacy. We have previously demonstrated that antagonism of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) by plerixafor (AMD3100) can decrease regulatory T (T)-cell intratumoral infiltration. Therefore, a combination of these 2 therapies might increase antitumor effects. Here, we evaluated the antitumor efficacy of AMD3100 and anti-PD-1 (αPD-1) antibody alone or in combination in an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model of ovarian cancer. We found that AMD3100, a highly specific CXCR4 antagonist, directly down-regulated the expression of both C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) and CXCR4  and  in tumor cells. AMD3100 and αPD-1 significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice when given as monotherapy. Combination of these 2 agents significantly enhanced antitumor effects compared with single-agent administration. Benefits of tumor control and animal survival were associated with immunomodulation mediated by these 2 agents, which were characterized by increased effector T-cell infiltration, increased effector T-cell function, and increased memory T cells in tumor microenvironment. Intratumoral T cells were decreased, and conversion of T cells into T helper cells was increased by AMD3100 treatment. Intratumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells were decreased by the combined treatment, which was associated with decreased IL-10 and IL-6 in the ascites. Also, the combination therapy decreased suppressive leukocytes and facilitated -to-M1 macrophage polarization in the tumor. These results suggest that AMD3100 could be used to target the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis to inhibit tumor growth and prevent multifaceted immunosuppression alone or in combination with αPD-1 in ovarian cancer, which could be clinically relevant to patients with this disease.-Zeng, Y., Li, B., Liang, Y., Reeves, P.

Activation of yes-associated protein (YAP), a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, has been shown to modulate tissue inflammation. However, it remains unknown as to whether and how the Hippo-YAP signaling may control NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) activation in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-mediated immune regulation during liver inflammation. In a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced liver sterile inflammatory injury, we found that adoptive transfer of MSCs reduced hepatocellular damage, shifted macrophage polarization from M1 to  phenotype, and diminished inflammatory mediators. MSC treatment reduced mammalian Ste20-like kinase 1/2 and large tumor suppressor 1 phosphorylation but augmented YAP and β-catenin expression with increased prostaglandin E2 production in ischemic livers. However, disruption of myeloid YAP or β-catenin in MSC-transferred mice exacerbated IR-triggered liver inflammation, enhanced NLRP3/caspase-1 activity, and reduced  macrophage phenotype. Using MSC/macrophage coculture system, we found that MSCs increased macrophage YAP and β-catenin nuclear translocation. Importantly, YAP and β-catenin colocalize in the nucleus while YAP interacts with β-catenin and regulates its target gene X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), leading to reduced NLRP3/caspase-1 activity after coculture. Moreover, macrophage YAP or β-catenin deficiency augmented XBP1/NLRP3 while XBP1 deletion diminished NLRP3/caspase-1 activity. Increasing NLRP3 expression reduced  macrophage arginase1 but augmented M1 macrophage inducible nitric oxide synthase expression accompanied by increased interleukin-1β release. Conclusion: MSCs promote macrophage Hippo pathway, which in turn controls NLRP3 activation through a direct interaction between YAP and β-catenin and regulates XBP1-mediated NLRP3 activation, leading to reprograming macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory  phenotype. Moreover, YAP functions as a transcriptional coactivator of β-catenin in MSC-mediated immune regulation. Our findings suggest a therapeutic target in MSC-mediated  of liver sterile inflammatory injury.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30271205>Low tumor purity is associated with poor prognosis, heavy mutation burden, and intense immune phenotype in colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Tumor purity is defined as the proportion of cancer cells in the tumor tissue. The impact of tumor purity on colon cancer (CC) prognosis, genetic profile, and microenvironment has not been thoroughly accessed.Clinical and transcriptomic data from three public datasets, GSE17536/17537, GSE39582, and TCGA, were retrospectively collected (n=1,248). Tumor purity of each sample was inferred by a computational method based on transcriptomic data. Survival-related analyses were performed on microarray dataset containing GSE17536/17537 and GSE39582 (n=794), whereas TCGA dataset was utilized for subsequent genomic analysis (n=454).Right-sided CC patients showed a significantly lower tumor purity. Low purity CC conferred worse survival, and tumor purity was identified as an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, high tumor purity CC patients benefited more from adjuvant chemotherapy. Subsequent genomic analysis found that the mutation burden was negatively associated with tumor purity, with only  and  significantly more mutated in high purity CC. However, no somatic copy number alteration event was correlated with tumor purity. Furthermore, immune-related pathways and -associated markers (programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1], programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1], cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4], Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [LAG-3] and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 [TIM-3]) were highly enriched in low purity samples. Notably, the relative proportion of  macrophages and neutrophils, which indicated worse survival in CC, was negatively associated with tumor purity.Tumor purity exhibited potential value for CC prognostic stratification as well as adjuvant chemotherapy benefit prediction. The relative worse survival in low purity CC may attribute to higher mutation frequency in key pathways and purity-related microenvironmental changing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30803083>Artificially Reprogrammed Macrophages as Tumor-Tropic Immunosuppression-Resistant Biologics to Realize Therapeutics Production and Immune Activation.</a></h2><p>To engineer patient-derived cells into therapy-purposed biologics is a promising solution to realize personalized treatments. Without using gene-editing technology, a live cell-typed therapeutic is engineered for tumor treatment by artificially reprogramming macrophages with hyaluronic acid-decorated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (HIONs). This nanoparticle-assisted cell-reprogramming strategy demonstrates profound advantages, due to the combined contributions from the biological regulation of HIONs and the intrinsic nature of macrophages. Firstly, the reprogrammed macrophages present a substantial improvement in their innate capabilities, such as more effective tumor targeting and more efficient generation of bioactive components (e.g., reactive oxygen species, bioactive cytokines) to suppress tumor growth. Furthermore, this cell therapeutic exhibits cytostatic/proapoptotic effects specific to cancer cells. Secondly, HIONs enable macrophages more resistant to the intratumoral immunosuppressive environment. Thirdly, the macrophages are endowed with a strong ability to prime in situ protumoral  macrophages into antitumor M1 phenotype in a paracrine-like manner. Consequently, a synergistic tumor-inhibition effect is achieved. This study shows that engineering nanomaterial-reprogrammed live cells as therapeutic biologics may be a more preferable option to the commonly used approaches where nanomaterials are administrated to induce bioresponse of certain cells in vivo.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To investigate whether deletion of TRIM59 in macrophages affects the metastatic potential of melanoma cells, we polarized control and TRIM59-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages to the  phenotype and collected the respective conditioned media (CM). Exposure to CM from TRIM59- cultures significantly promoted migration and invasion by B16-F0 and B16-F10 cells. Cytokine profiling indicated a ~15-fold increase in TNF-α production in CM from TRIM59- cultures, and neutralizing TNF-α activity abrogated the referred stimulatory effects on cell motility. Transcriptome analysis revealed significant upregulation of  and  in melanoma cells exposed to TRIM59- CM. Inhibitory experiments determined that these changes were also TNF-α-dependent and mediated by activation of ERK signaling. Independent knockdown of  and  in B16-F10 cells impeded epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth and formation of metastatic lung nodules in vivo. These data suggest TRIM59 expression attenuates the tumor-promoting effect of tumor-associated macrophages, most of which resemble the  phenotype. Moreover, they highlight the relevance of TRIM59 in macrophages as a potential regulator of tumor metastasis and suggest TRIM59 could serve as a novel target for cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29464055>[Neratinib + Valproate] exposure permanently reduces ERBB1 and RAS expression in 4T1 mammary tumors and enhances M1 macrophage infiltration.</a></h2><p>The irreversible ERBB1/2/4 inhibitor neratinib has been shown  to rapidly reduce the expression of ERBB1/2/4 and RAS proteins via autophagic/lysosomal degradation. We have recently demonstrated that neratinib and valproate interact to suppress the growth of 4T1 mammary tumors but had not defined whether the [neratinib + valproate] drug combination, in a mouse, had altered the biology of the 4T1 cells. Exposure of 4T1 mammary tumors to [neratinib + valproate] for three days resulted, two weeks later, in tumors that expressed less ERBB1, K-RAS, N-RAS, indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and had increased Class I MHCA expression. Tumors previously exposed to [neratinib + valproate] grew more slowly than those exposed to vehicle control and contained more CD8+ cells and activated NK cells. M1 but not  macrophage infiltration was significantly enhanced by the drug combination.  exposure of 4T1 tumor cells to [neratinib + valproate] variably reduced the expression of histone deacetylases 1-11. , prior exposure of tumors to [neratinib + valproate] permanently reduced the expression of HDACs 1-3, 6 and 10. Combined knock down of HDACs 1/2/3 or of 3/10 rapidly reduced the expression IDO-1, and ODC and increased the expression of MHCA. H&E staining of normal tissues at animal nadir revealed no obvious cyto-architectural differences between control and drug-treated animals. We conclude that [neratinib + valproate] evolves 4T1 tumors to grow more slowly and to be more sensitive to checkpoint  antibodies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613266>Arg1 expression defines immunosuppressive subsets of tumor-associated macrophages.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) have attracted attention as they can modulate key cancer-related activities, yet TAM represent a heterogenous group of cells that remain incompletely characterized. In growing tumors, TAM are often referred to as -like macrophages, which are cells that display immunosuppressive and tumorigenic functions and express the enzyme arginase 1 (Arg1).  Here we combined high resolution intravital imaging with single cell RNA seq to uncover the topography and molecular profiles of immunosuppressive macrophages in mice. We further assessed how immunotherapeutic interventions impact these cells directly .  We show that: i) Arg1+ macrophages are more abundant in tumors compared to other organs; ii) there exist two morphologically distinct subsets of Arg1 TAM defined by previously unknown markers (Gbp2b, Bst1, Sgk1, Pmepa1, Ms4a7); iii) anti-Programmed Cell Death-1 (aPD-1) therapy decreases the number of Arg1+ TAM while increasing Arg1- TAM; iv) accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of arginase 1 does not synergize with aPD-1 therapy.  Overall, this research shows how powerful complementary single cell analytical approaches can be used to improve our understanding of drug action .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30753130>Type 1 diabetes impairs the mobilisation of highly-differentiated CD8+T cells during a single bout of acute exercise.</a></h2><p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T cell mediated autoimmune disease that targets and destroys insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells. Beta cell specific T cells are highly differentiated and show evidence of previous antigen exposure. Exerciseinduced mobilisation of highly-differentiated CD8+ T cells facilitates immune surveillance and regulation. We aimed to explore exercise-induced T cell mobilisation in T1D. In this study, we compared the effects of a single bout of vigorous intensity exercise on T cell mobilisation in T1D and control participants. N=12 T1D (mean age 33.2yrs, predicted VO2 max 32.2 mL/(kg·min), BMI 25.3Kg/) and N=12 control (mean age 29.4yrs, predicted VO2 max 38.5mL(kg.min), BMI 23.7Kg/) male participants completed a 30-minute bout of cycling at 80% predicted VO2 max in a fasted state. Peripheral blood was collected at baseline, immediately post-exercise, and 1 hour post-exercise. Exercise-induced mobilisation was observed for T cells in both T1D and control groups. Total CD8+ T cells mobilised to a similar extent in T1D (42.7%; p=0.016) and controls (39.7%; p=0.001). CD8 effector memory CD45RA+ (EMRA) subset were the only T cell lineage subset to be significantly mobilised in both groups though the percentage increase of CD8+ EMRA was blunted in T1D (T1D (26.5%) p=0.004, control (66.1%) p=0.010). Further phenotyping of these subsets revealed that the blunting was most evident in CD8+ EMRA that expressed adhesion (CD11b: T1D 37.70%, Control 91.48%) and activation markers (CD69: T1D 29.87%, Control 161.43%), and appeared to be the most differentiated (CD27-CD28-: T1D 7.12%, Control 113.76%). CD4+ T cells mobilised during vigorous intensity exercise in controls (p=0.001), but not in T1D. The blunted mobilisation response of particular T cell subsets was not due to CMV serostatus or apparent differences in exertion during the exercise bout as defined by heart rate and RPE. Predicted VO2 max showed a trend to be lower in the T1D group than the control group but is unlikely to contribute to this blunted response. We postulate the reasons for a blunted mobilisation of differentiated CD8+ EMRA cells includes differences in blood glucose, adrenaline receptor density, and sequestration of T cells in the pancreas of T1D participants. In conclusion, mobilisation of CD8+ EMRA and CD4+ subsets T cells is decreased in people with T1D during acute exercise.Copyright © 2019 International Society of Exercise and Immunology.

Recently,  is emerging as an innovative and highly conceivable strategy for AD treatment. The cGAMP-STING-IRF3 signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in mediating innate immune responses. In this study, we provide pioneering investigation to find that the STING stimulator, cGAMP, significantly ameliorates cognitive deficits, improves pathological changes, decreases Aβ plaque load and reduces neuron apoptosis in APP/PS1 transgenetic mice. The stimulation of cGAMP-STING-IRF3 pathway induces expression of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), and the overexpression of TREM2 further decreases Aβ deposition and neuron loss while improves AD pathomorphology and cognitive impairment. Additionally, TREM2 regulates microglia polarization from M1 towards  phenotype thereby achieves reduction of neuroinflammation in AD. These findings support that the enhancement of TREM2 exerts beneficial effects in ameliorating AD development. Taken together, our results demonstrate that cGAMP is a potential candidate for applications in Alzheimer's disease .Copyright © 2019.

However, the immunotherapeutic effect of prostate cancer is unsatisfactory. We found that the expression of TRIB1 was significantly correlated with the infiltration of CD163+ macrophages in prostate cancer. This study focused on the effects of TRIB1 on macrophage polarization in the immune microenvironment of prostate cancer. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that TRIB1 has significant effects on the regulation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway and downstream cytokines. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to examine THP-1 cells cultured in conditioned medium from prostate cancer cells overexpressing TRIB1 and showed that overexpression of TRIB1 promoted the secretion of CXCL2 and interleukin (IL)8 by PC3 cells, which increased the secretion of IL12 by THP-1 cells as well as the expression of CD163 on THP-1 cells. IKB-zeta, regulated by TRIB1, was expressed in PC3 cells but was barely detectable in DU145 cells. The reductions in CXCL2 and IL8 by the inhibition of TRIB1 were rescued by the deletion of IKB-zeta.

Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a major player controlling the immunosuppressive TME in different murine tumor models. Increased IL-10 production suppresses intratumoral dendritic cell production of interleukin 12, thereby limiting antitumor cytotoxic T-cell responses and activation of NK cells during therapy. We engineered, formulated, and delivered genes encoding an IL-10 protein trap to change immunosuppressive TME, which could enhance antitumor immunity. Additionally, to achieve stronger and long-term therapeutic efficacy in a pancreatic cancer model, we targeted C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), a key factor for inhibiting T-cell tumor infiltration, and simultaneously delivered an IL-10 trap. Following three injections of the lipid-protamine-DNA (LPD) nanoparticles loaded with trap genes (IL-10 trap and CXCL12 trap), we found tumor growth reduction and significantly prolonged survival of the host compared to control groups. Furthermore, the combination trap gene treatment significantly reduced immunosuppressive cells, such as  macrophages, MDSCs, and PD-L1 cells, and activated immunosuppressive tolerogenic dendritic cells, NK cells, and macrophages intratumorally. We have also shown that, when effectively delivered to the tumor, the IL-10 trap gene alone can inhibit triple-negative breast cancer growth. This strategy may allow clinicians and researchers to change the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the tumor with either a single therapeutic agent or in combination with other immunotherapies to prime the immune system, preventing cancer invasion and prolonging patient survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735937>IL-37 suppresses the sustained hepatic IFN-γ/TNF-α production and T cell-dependent liver injury.</a></h2><p>T cell-dependent liver injury is an important reason for the massive hepatic damage and cirrhosis. So far it is unclear whether the development of the disease could be efficiently suppressed by anti-inflammatory cytokine that modulates innate immune cells. Here we report that anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37 could efficiently suppress the sustained hepatic expression of IFN-γ and TNF-α, two critical cytokines for inducing hepatocyte apoptosis and liver fibrosis in T cell-dependent liver injury. IL-37 could directly suppress IFN-γ/TLR4 ligand-induced M1 activation of macrophages, thus reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-12. Moreover, IL-37 attenuated Th1 response in vivo and increased the expression of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, which in turn promoted  activation of macrophages in the liver. The increase of  activation not only further reduced TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-12 expression, but also increased IL-10 and IL-1Ra expression in macrophages, thus more efficiently suppressing the hepatic IFN-γ expression. By suppressing IFN-γ/TNF-α expression, IL-37 suppressed the up-regulation and activation of MLKL that drives hepatocellular necrosis in T cell-dependent liver damage. Accordingly, IL-37 efficiently reduced liver injury and hepatic inflammation after the repeated ConA challenge and the induction of autoimmune hepatitis, and also suppressed hepatic fibrosis resulting from the sustained liver damage. This study showed that the direct and indirect effect of IL-37 on macrophages could reduce the hepatic TNF-α expression, and also modulate IL-1β/IL-12 and IL-10/IL-1Ra expression to suppress the hepatic IFN-γ expression, thus suppressing the development of T cell-dependent liver injury such as autoimmune hepatitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, these methods cannot make full use of the positive immune-modulatory effects of macrophages. This study explores a two-way cruise strategy for combining  based on TAM phenotype reversal with classical chemotherapy, the nanosatellites (DOX@HFn-PGZL@Res) are proposed to accurately deliver the chemotherapeutic agents and immune activators to their respective target cells. When the delivery system is recruited to tumor microenvironment, the nanosatellites are separated into DOX@HFn and Res@GZL nanoparticles, which can enter cancer cells and -TAMs, respectively. The data show that DOX@HFn-PGZL@Res successfully re-educate  to M1 macrophages, resulting in an activated immune response and inhibition of tumor invasion and metastasis.

Little is known on the origin of circulating miRNAs and their relationship with the tumor microenvironment in lung cancer. Here, we focused on the cellular source and relative contribution of different cell types to circulating miRNAs composing our risk classifier of lung cancer using in vitro/in vivo models and clinical samples. A cell-type specific expression pattern and topography of several miRNAs such as mir-145 in fibroblasts, mir-126 in endothelial cells, mir-133a in skeletal muscle cells was observed in normal and lung cancer tissues. Granulocytes and platelets are the major contributors of miRNAs release in blood. miRNAs modulation observed in plasma of lung cancer subjects was consistent with de-regulation of the same miRNAs observed during immunosuppressive conversion of immune cells. In particular, activated neutrophils showed a miRNA profile mirroring that observed in plasma of lung cancer subjects. Interestingly mir-320a secreted by neutrophils of high-risk heavy-smokers promoted an -like protumorigenic phenotype through downregulation of STAT4 when shuttled into macrophages. These findings suggest a multifactorial and nonepithelial cell-autonomous origin of circulating miRNAs associated with risk of lung cancer and that circulating miRNAs may act in paracrine signaling with causative role in lung carcinogenesis and immunosuppression.© 2018 The Authors.

Cytokine networking between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) maintains the self-renewing subpopulation of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) that mediate tumor heterogeneity, resistance and recurrence.  of those factors combined with targeted therapy or chemoagents may advantage TNBC treatment.We found that the oncogene Multiple Copies in T-cell Malignancy 1 (MCT-1/MCTS1) expression is a new poor-prognosis marker in patients with aggressive breast cancers. Overexpressing MCT-1 perturbed the oncogenic breast epithelial acini morphogenesis and stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and matrix metalloproteinase activation in invasive TNBC cells, which were repressed after MCT-1 gene silencing. As mammary tumor progression was promoted by oncogenic MCT-1 activation, tumor-promoting  macrophages were enriched in TME, whereas  macrophages were decreased and tumor-suppressive M1 macrophages were increased as the tumor was repressed via MCT-1 knockdown. MCT-1 stimulated interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion that promoted monocytic THP-1 polarization into -like macrophages to increase TNBC cell invasiveness. In addition, MCT-1 elevated the soluble IL-6 receptor levels, and thus, IL-6R antibodies antagonized the effect of MCT-1 on promoting -like polarization and cancer cell invasion. Notably, MCT-1 increased the features of BCSCs, which were further advanced by IL-6 but prevented by tocilizumab, a humanized IL-6R antibody, thus MCT-1 knockdown and tocilizumab synergistically inhibited TNBC stemness. Tumor suppressor miR-34a was induced upon MCT-1 knockdown that inhibited IL-6R expression and activated M1 polarization.The MCT-1 pathway is a novel and promising therapeutic target for TNBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30373410>The immune microenvironment in vulvar (pre)cancer: review of literature and implications for .</a></h2><p>Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) develops via two different pathways: TP53 mutations in a background of lichen sclerosus or a persistent infection with high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV). The latter group of tumor responds better to treatment than the non-virally induced VSCC. This may be explained by a difference in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME).This review summarizes literature on TME of VSCC and its precursors, and extrapolates this to foster the development of new therapeutic strategies.Both types of VSCC and their precursors are infiltrated with variable numbers of  macrophages, regulatory T cells and CD8+ T cells, indicating that they express targetable tumor antigens. Type 1 T cell immunity in precursor lesions is associated with fewer recurrences and better clinical responses to . Escape of these lesions and progression toward VSCC is associated with the downregulation of HLA Class I, increased expression of co-inhibitory molecules, infiltration with immunosuppressive cells and the local production of immunosuppressive enzymes and cytokines. More in-depth studies of the VSCC TME are required to fully comprehend the impact of the immune system on VSCC, and subsequently to identify patients who will benefit from immunotherapeutic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30345161>TLR7/8-agonist-loaded nanoparticles promote the polarization of tumour-associated macrophages to enhance cancer .</a></h2><p>Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in many cancers, and often display an immune-suppressive -like phenotype that fosters tumour growth and promotes resistance to therapy. Yet macrophages are highly plastic and can also acquire an anti-tumourigenic M1-like phenotype. Here, we show that R848, an agonist of the toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR7 and TLR8 identified in a morphometric-based screen, is a potent driver of the M1 phenotype in vitro and that R848-loaded β-cyclodextrin nanoparticles (CDNPs) lead to efficient drug delivery to TAMs in vivo. As a monotherapy, the administration of CDNP-R848 in multiple tumour models in mice altered the functional orientation of the tumour immune microenvironment towards an M1 phenotype, leading to controlled tumour growth and protecting the animals against tumour rechallenge. When used in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1, we observed improved  response rates, also in a tumour model resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our findings demonstrate the ability of rationally engineered drug-nanoparticle combinations to efficiently modulate TAMs for cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30179634>Passively transferred M2e-specific monoclonal antibody reduces influenza A virus transmission in mice.</a></h2><p>Influenza represents a global public health threat. Currently available influenza vaccines are effective against strain-matched influenza A and B viruses but do not protect against novel pandemic viruses. Vaccine candidates that target conserved B or T cell epitopes of influenza viruses could circumvent this shortcoming. The conserved extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) of influenza A is an example of such a broadly protective vaccine candidate. Protection by M2e-based vaccine candidates largely depends on M2e-specific IgG antibodies. Here we show that the M2e-specific IgG2a monoclonal antibody 65 (MAb 65) can reduce influenza A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) and A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) virus plaque formation. This effect was not observed with other influenza A virus strains tested. We further show that passive transfer of MAb 65 to mice can reduce viral loads in the upper and lower airways, which results in reduced transmission of A/Udorn/72 and A/Hong Kong/68 viruses to cohoused, unimmunized contact mice. Virus restriction by passively transferred Mab 65 was significantly less pronounced in Fcgr1Fcgr3 mutant mice compared with wild type controls, suggesting that in vivo protection provided by MAb 65 depends on Fcγ receptor-mediated antibody effector mechanisms. We conclude that M2e-based antibody immune therapy has the potential to diminish influenza A virus replication in the immunized host as well as in exposed naïve contacts.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Accordingly, macrophages occupy distinct metabolic profiles, regulated by orchestrated factors and signaling pathways, including the PI3K-AKT, HIF, c-Myc, AMPK, and PPARs pathways. These factors and pathways play pivotal roles not only in metabolic regulation but also in macrophage polarization. After activation, classically activated M1 macrophages and alternatively activated  macrophages display distinct patterns in glucose, lipid, amino acid and iron metabolism. Here, we summarized recently discovered metabolism-related inflammatory signaling factors, along with reprogrammed metabolism, after the activation of macrophages under conditions related to immunity and cancer. Additionally, macrophage regulatory roles in infectious diseases, cancer progression and anti-cancer  are discussed in terms of metabolic profiles, providing insight into the prevention and treatment of immune-associated diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Both human amniotic epithelial and mesenchymal stromal cells, and the conditioned medium generated from their culture, exert multiple immunosuppressive activities. Indeed, they inhibit T and B cell proliferation, suppress inflammatory properties of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and natural killer cells, while promoting induction of cells with regulatory functions such as regulatory T cells and anti-inflammatory  macrophages. These properties have laid the foundation for their use for the treatment of inflammatory-based diseases, and encouraging results have been obtained in different preclinical disease models where exacerbated inflammation is present. Moreover, an immune-privileged status of amniotic cells has been often highlighted. However, even if long-term engraftment of amniotic cells has been reported into immunocompetent animals, only few cells survive after infusion. Furthermore, amniotic cells have been shown to be able to induce immune responses in vivo and, under specific culture conditions, they can stimulate T cell proliferation in vitro. Although immunosuppressive properties are a widely recognized characteristic of amniotic cells, immunogenic and stimulatory activities appear to be less reported, sporadic events. In order to improve therapeutic outcome, the mechanisms responsible for the suppressive versus stimulatory activity need to be carefully addressed. In this review, both the immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory activity of amniotic cells will be discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999958>Treatment of malignant pleural effusions: the case for localized .</a></h2><p>Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are a common terminal pathway for many cancers, with an estimated United States incidence of more than 150,000 cases per year. MPE is an aggressive disease with a uniformly fatal prognosis and a life expectancy of only 3 to 12 months. The development of an effective targeted therapy represents a pressing unmet need. This commentary focuses on how cellular and humoral components condition the pleural space as a tumor-promoting, wound-healing environment. Despite an abundance of potential antigen presenting and effector cells in the pleura, their physical isolation by the mesothelial barrier, the concentration of cytokines and chemokines driving the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and  /Th-2 polarization, suppress tumor-specific immune effector responses. We argue that local immune repolarization must precede either immune checkpoint or cellular therapy to successfully eradicate pleural tumor. We further hypothesize that, because of its cellular content, a repolarized pleural space will provide an effective immune environment for generation of systemic anti-tumor response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30879106>An immunosuppressive macrophage profile attenuates the prognostic impact of CD20-positive B cells in human soft tissue sarcoma.</a></h2><p>Immune cells can regulate disease progression and response to treatment in multiple tumor types, but their activities in human soft tissue sarcoma are poorly characterized.Marker-defined immune cell subsets were characterized from a tumor microenvironmental perspective in two independent cohorts of human soft tissue sarcoma by multiplex IHC, quantitative PCR and/or bioinformatics.B cell profiling revealed a prognostic role for CD20 protein (cohort 1, 33 patients) and MS4A1 gene expression (cohort 2, 265 patients). Multiplex IHC and gene correlation analysis supported a role in antigen presentation, immune cell differentiation and T cell activation. The prognostic role of MS4A1 expressing B cells was only observed in an IL10, PTGS2 or CD163 tumor microenvironment according to the transcriptomic data. IL10 levels consistently correlated with the -like macrophage marker CD163, which also defined the majority of macrophages. A polarization of these cells toward a pro-tumoral phenotype was further supported by lack of correlation between CD163 and M1 markers like NOS2, as well as by low abundance of CD80 positive cells in tissue.Analysis of CD20/MS4A1 expression in soft tissue sarcoma merits further attention as a promising candidate prognostic tool for survival, but not in patients with a pronounced immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Macrophages are ubiquitous and polarized toward a protumoral phenotype.

Here we investigated the effects of glioma-derived exosomes (GDEs) on macrophage polarization and glioma progression. We also performed microRNA sequencing analysis of GDEs to identify the microRNA that mediated macrophage polarization. The microRNA-associated intracellular signaling pathway in macrophages was further investigated. Compared with normoxic glioma-derived exosomes (N-GDEs), hypoxic glioma-derived exosomes (H-GDEs) markedly induced  macrophage polarization, which subsequently promoted glioma proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. MicroRNA sequencing analysis identified miR-1246 as the most enriched microRNA in H-GDEs. Moreover, miR-1246 was enriched in the CSF of GBM patients and decreased after tumor resection. Further investigation determined that miR-1246 mediated H-GDE-induced  macrophage polarization by targeting TERF2IP to activate the STAT3 signaling pathway and inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our study elucidated a mechanism by which hypoxia and glioma influence  macrophage polarization via exosomes, which could facilitate the formation of the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Moreover, our results suggested that miR-1246 in the CSF of GBM patients may be a novel biomarker for GBM diagnosis and that treatment targeting microRNA-1246 may contribute to antitumor .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29539427>Bimodal CD40/Fas-Dependent Crosstalk between iNKT Cells and Tumor-Associated Macrophages Impairs Prostate Cancer Progression.</a></h2><p>Heterotypic cellular and molecular interactions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) control cancer progression. Here, we show that CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer (iNKT) cells control prostate cancer (PCa) progression by sculpting the TME. In a mouse PCa model, iNKT cells restrained the pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive capabilities of tumor-infiltrating immune cells by reducing pro-angiogenic TIE2, -like macrophages (TEMs), and sustaining pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages. iNKT cells directly contacted macrophages in the PCa stroma, and iNKT cell transfer into tumor-bearing mice abated TEMs, delaying tumor progression. iNKT cells modulated macrophages through the cooperative engagement of CD1d, Fas, and CD40, which promoted selective killing of -like and survival of M1-like macrophages. Human PCa aggressiveness associate with reduced intra-tumoral iNKT cells, increased TEMs, and expression of pro-angiogenic genes, underscoring the clinical significance of this crosstalk. Therefore, iNKT cells may control PCa through mechanisms involving differential macrophage modulation, which may be harnessed for therapeutically reprogramming the TME.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), macrophage type 2 () cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) could make immunologic barriers against CD8  T cell-mediated antitumor immune responses. Thus, CD8  T cells are needed to be primed and activated toward effector CTLs in a process called tumor immunity cycle for making durable and efficient antitumor immune responses. The CD8  T cell priming is directed essentially as a corroboration work between cells of innate immunity including dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells with CD4  T cells in adoptive immunity. Upon activation, effector CTLs infiltrate to the core or invading site of the tumor (so-called infiltrated-inflamed [I-I] TME) and take essential roles for killing cancer cells.

Due to a diverse relation between CTLs with Tregs, the Treg activity could be dampened for increasing the number and rescuing the functional potential of CTLs to induce immunosensitivity of cancer cells.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632723>Enhanced protection of C57 BL/6 vs Balb/c mice to melanoma liver metastasis is mediated by NK cells.</a></h2><p>The B16F10 murine melanoma cell line displays a low expression of MHC class I molecules favoring immune evasion and metastases in immunocompetent C57 BL/6 wild-type mice. Here, we generated metastases to the liver, an organ that is skewed towards immune tolerance, by intrasplenic injection of B16F10 cells in syngeneic C57 BL/6 compared to allogeneic Balb/c mice. Surprisingly, Balb/c mice, which usually display a pronounced  macrophage and Th2 T cell polarization, were ∼3 times more susceptible to metastasis than C57 BL/6 mice, despite a much higher M1 and Th1 T cell immune response. The anti-metastatic advantage of C57 BL/6 mice could be attributed to a more potent NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity against B16F10 cells.

The polarization from the protumor  (TAM2) to antitumor M1 (TAM1) phenotype can not only lift the immunosuppressive constraints and elicit cytotoxic T-cell immunity but also augment the chemotherapy efficacy. However, the treatment feasibility by TAM modulation in brain tumors and the mechanisms remained unknown. A dual-targeting biomimetic codelivery and treatment strategy was developed for anti-glioma activity. We demonstrated that the albumin nanoparticles modified with dual ligands, a transferrin receptor (TfR)-binding peptide T12 and mannose, efficiently passed through the BBB  the nutrient transporters (, TfR and the albumin-binding receptor SPARC) that were both overexpressed in the BBB and glioma cells, thus achieving biomimetic delivery to glioma. Importantly, after penetrating the BBB, this system can take advantage of the overexpression of the SPARC and mannose receptors on TAM2, thus also targeting the protumor TAM2. With the codelivery disulfiram/copper complex and regorafenib, the system efficiently inhibited the glioma cell proliferation and successfully "re-educated" the protumor TAM2 towards antitumor TAM1. The treatment efficacy was examined in the glioma-bearing nude mice and immunocompetent mice. It showed this system yielded an enhanced treatment outcome, owing to the synergistic combination of chemotherapy and macrophage-directed . The importance of this delivery and therapeutic strategy was to remodel the immune microenvironment and reprogram TAM and trigger macrophage-directed anti-glioma   the interplay of the TAM, Treg, and CD8 T cells and the effector cytokines.

Here, we show that OSM is overexpressed in human cSCC and is associated with type 1 immune polarization. , OSM induced STAT-3 and ERK signaling, modified the expression of genes involved in cytokine signaling, proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and immune responses, and promoted proliferation and migration of malignant keratinocyte PDVC57 cells. PDVC57 cells grafted in the skin of mice led to rapid cSCC development, associated with OSM expression by tumor-infiltrating neutrophils. Finally, the absence of OSM (OSM-KO mice) led to a 30% reduction of tumor size and reduced  polarization in the tumor microenvironment. Globally, these results support a pro-tumoral role of OSM in cSCC development and suggest that a new therapeutic approach targeting this cytokine could be considered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30701923>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with alpha/beta T-lymphocyte depletion and short course of eculizumab in adolescents and young adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.</a></h2><p>The main goal is to optimize hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) approach among adolescents and young adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) by means of Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and post-transplant complications risk lowering.We report our experience of HSCT from HLA-matched unrelated donors using TCR alfa/beta and CD19 depletion in 5 pts (1M/4F) with PNH, developed after successful immunosuppressive therapy (IST) of acquired aplastic anemia (AA).

Tumors employ immune checkpoints to evade immune cell attacks. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-L1 antibody (aPD-L1), which is being used clinically for cancer treatments, can block immune checkpoints so that the immune system can attack tumors. However, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy may be hampered by polarization of macrophages within the tumor microenvironment (TME) into  tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which suppress antitumor immune responses and promote tumor growth by releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors. In this study, we used exosome-mimetic nanovesicles derived from M1 macrophages (M1NVs) to repolarize  TAMs to M1 macrophages that release pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce antitumor immune responses and investigated whether the macrophage repolarization can potentiate the anticancer efficacy of aPD-L1. M1NV treatment induced successful polarization of  macrophages to M1 macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Intravenous injection of M1NVs into tumor-bearing mice suppressed tumor growth. Importantly, injection of a combination of M1NVs and aPD-L1 further reduced the tumor size, compared to the injection of either M1NVs or aPD-L1 alone.

CD31 analysis of excised tumors was used to evaluate anti-angiogenesis effects. The titers of anti-VEGF antibody was detected by ELISA and verified by western blot analyses, and the effects of immune sera on HUVEC differentiation were investigated by tube formation assay.M could assist hVEGF to exhibit more favorable therapeutic anti-tumor growth and metastasis effects than hVEGF. Meanwhile, high titer of anti-VEGF antibody was detected in hVEGF-M immunized mice sera by ELISA and verified by western blot analysis. Sera from hVEGF-M immunized mice could more significantly inhibit HUVEC tube formation than hVEGF immune serum. The hVEGF-M-immune sera could more effectively inhibit H22 tumor growth and extend the survival rates of H22 tumor bearing mice than hVEGF-immune sera.

A favorable response to ICR blockade relies on an extensive collection of preexisting tumor-specific T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). ICR blockade reinvigorates exhausted CD8 T cells and enhances immune killing. However, resistance to ICR blockade is observed in about 85% of patients with HNSCC, therefore highlighting the importance of characterizing the mechanisms underlying HNSCC immune escape and exploring combinatorial strategies to sensitize hypoimmunogenic cold HNSCC to ICR inhibition. Cancer vaccines are designed to bypass the cold TME and directly deliver cancer antigens to antigen-presenting cells (APCs); these vaccines epitomize a priming strategy to synergize with ICR inhibitors. Cancer cells are ineffective antigen presenters, and poor APC infiltration as well as the -like polarization in the TME further dampens antigen uptake and processing, both of which render ineffective innate and adaptive immune detection. Cancer vaccines directly activate APC and expand the tumor-specific T-cell repertoire. In addition, cancer vaccines often contain an adjuvant, which further improves APC function, promotes epitope spreading, and augments host intrinsic antitumor immunity. Thus, the vaccine-induced immune priming generates a pool of effectors whose function can be enhanced by ICR inhibitors. In this review, we summarize the major HNSCC immune evasion strategies, the ongoing effort toward improving HNSCC vaccines, and the current challenges limiting the efficacy of cancer vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30119258>Inhibition of IL-18 reduces renal fibrosis after ischemia-reperfusion.</a></h2><p>Acute kidney injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a high risk factor in the progression towards chronic kidney disease, which is featured by renal interstitial fibrosis. Interleukin (IL)-18 is produced by T cells and macrophages and has been involved in the pathophysiology of IRI. However, the role of IL-18 in IRI-induced renal fibrosis is poorly understood. In the present study, we showed that interleukin (IL)-18 was significantly up-regulated after IRI stress. Mice treated with IL-18 Bp, a natural inhibitor of IL-18, presented less severe fibrotic response in the kidneys following IRI compared with vehicle-treated mice. Inhibition of IL-18 decreased myofibroblasts formation in the kidneys in response to IRI, which was associated with reduction of fibronectin and collagenⅠproteins. Moreover, inhibition of IL-18 impaired infiltration of CD3 T cells and F4/80 macrophages in the kidneys of mice after IRI. Treatment with IL-18 Bp reduces the levels of profibrotic molecules in the kidneys of mice following IRI. Finally, administration of IL-18 Bp impedes the transition of  macrophages to myofibroblasts and suppressed the accumulation of bone marrow-derived  macrophages. Adoptive transfer of  macrophages abolished the anti-fibrotic effect of IL-18 Bp. In summary, our results suggest that IL-18 plays an important role in the progression of IRI-induced renal fibrosis via modulating inflammation cells infiltration, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and the transition of bone marrow-derived  macrophages to myofibroblasts.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Reprogramming -like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to antitumor M1 phenotype represents as a promising strategy in cancer . In this work we reported that one cationic polysaccharide spermine modified pullulan (PS) could act as an effective immunological stimulator to modulating either naïve (M0) or  macrophages towards M1 phenotype. We showed that PS upregulated the expression of TLR1/3/4 and promoted the phosphorylation of Akt, Erk, JNK, following the activation of NF-κB, which led to the polarization towards M1. In a murine breast cancer model of tumor cell 4T1 inoculation, subcutaneous injection of PS induced effective antitumor effect through reprogramming  macrophages in the tumor microenvironment to M1, increased CD4 and CD8 T cells, and decreased the expression of CD31 in the tumor mass, which together inhibited the tumor progression and the metastasis in lung and liver, leading to the prolong of the mice survival. In conclusion, PS could effectively stimulate the immunological function of macrophages. Therefore, PS may provide a novel immunological stimulator to cancer immune therapies.Copyright © 2018.

However, immune checkpoint blockade is still suboptimal in HCC treatment and more immune modifications are needed to achieve an efficient therapeutic goal. Here, we investigated the combined administration of a Listeria-based HCC vaccine, Lmdd-MPFG, and the anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade antibody. We found that Lmdd-MPFG promoted the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells but resensitized the tumor local T cell to respond to the anti-PD-1 . Mechanistically, the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine activates the NF-κB pathway in the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the TLR2 and MyD88 pathway, and recruits p62 to activate the autophagy pathway. The overall effect is skewing the TAMs from -polarized TAMs into the M1-polarized TAMs. Most importantly, it skewed the cytokine profiles into antitumor one in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This change restores the T-cell reactivity to the anti-PD-1 blockade. Our results suggested that Lmdd-MPFG combined with PD-1 blockade exerted synergistic antitumor effects through modifying TAMs in the TME and removing T-cell inhibitory signals, thereby providing a new potential strategy for HCC treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069131>A replication-incompetent CD154/40L recombinant vaccinia virus induces direct and macrophage-mediated antitumor effects  and .</a></h2><p>CD40 triggering may result in antitumor effects of potentially high clinical relevance. To gain insights important for patient selection and to identify adequate targeting techniques, we investigated CD40 expression in human cancer tissues and generated a replication-incompetent recombinant vaccinia virus expressing CD40 ligand (rVV40L). Its effects were explored  and  upon direct CD40 targeting on malignant cells or macrophage activation. CD40 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in tumor and stromal cells in a multi-tumor array including 836 specimens from 27 different tumor types. Established tumor cell lines were used to explore the capacity of rVV40L to induce malignant cell apoptosis and modulate functional profiles of polarized macrophages. CD40 expression was detectable in significantly higher numbers of stromal as compared to malignant cells in lung and breast cancers. CD40 ligation following rVV40L infection induced apoptosis in CD40(+) cancer cells, but only in the presence of intact specific signal transduction chain. Importantly, rVV40L infection promoted the induction of TNF-α-dependent antitumor activity of M1-like macrophages directed against CD40(-) targets. CD40-activated M1-like macrophages also displayed enhanced ability to CXCL10-dependently recruit CD8+ T cells and to efficiently present cancer cell intracellular antigens through cross-priming. Moreover, rVV-driven CD40L expression partially "re-educated" -like macrophages, as suggested by detectable CXCL10 and IL-12 production. Most importantly, we observed that intra-tumoral injection of rVV40L-infected human macrophages inhibits progression of human CD40(-) tumors . First evidences of anticancer activity of rVV40L strongly encourage further evaluations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524879>PD-L1 expression with immune-infiltrate evaluation and outcome prediction in melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab.</a></h2><p>: Tumor microenvironment may have a key role in providing immunological markers that can help predict clinical response to treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. We investigated whether the baseline expression of PD-L1 in advanced melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab may correlate with clinical outcome. : PD-L1 expression was assessed in 114 patients with advanced melanoma treated with ipilimumab and, in a cohort of 77 patients, a comprehensive assessment using multispectral imaging to assess the presence and distribution of CD3+, CD8+, CD163+, FOXP3+ and PD-L1+ cells inside and at periphery of the tumor was performed. : PD-L1 status alone was not a predictive biomarker for response or survival. There was an association between clinical benefit from ipilimumab therapy with the coexistence of low densities of CD8+ and high densities of CD163+ PD-L1+ cells at the periphery of the tumor. : To explain the association of this peculiar microenvironment with clinical benefit from ipilimumab, we proposed a model where baseline CD8 cells levels are low due to inhibitory effect of Tregs and to pro-tumor activity of TAM  (CD163+ PD-L1+ cells). Ipilimumab treatment causes a decrease of Treg cells, mediated by ADCC from macrophages, with a concomitant change in TAM polarization that switches from  to M1 with a subsequent attraction of CD8 cells and the increase of antitumor response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174610>Targeting of -like tumor-associated macrophages with a melittin-based pro-apoptotic peptide.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the major component of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Macrophages are broadly categorized as M1 or  types, and TAMs have been shown to express an -like phenotype. TAMs promote tumor progression and contribute to resistance to chemotherapies. Therefore, -like TAMs are potential targets for the cancer . In this study, we targeted -like TAMs using a hybrid peptide, MEL-dKLA, composed of melittin (MEL), which binds preferentially to -like TAMs, and the pro-apoptotic peptide d (KLAKLAK) (dKLA), which induces mitochondrial death after cell membrane penetration.The M1 or -differentiated RAW264.7 cells were used for mitochondrial colocalization and apoptosis test in vitro. For in vivo study, the murine Lewis lung carcinoma cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank of mouse. The dKLA, MEL and MEL-dKLA peptides were intraperitoneally injected at 175 nmol/kg every 3 days. Flow cytometry analysis of tumor-associated macrophages and immunofluorescence staining were performed to investigate the immunotherapeutic effects of MEL-dKLA.We showed that MEL-dKLA induced selective cell death of  macrophages in vitro, whereas MEL did not disrupt the mitochondrial membrane. We also showed that MEL-dKLA selectively targeted -like TAMs without affecting other leukocytes, such as T cells and dendritic cells, in vivo. These features resulted in lower tumor growth rates, tumor weights, and angiogenesis in vivo. Importantly, although both MEL and MEL-dKLA reduced numbers of CD206 -like TAMs in tumors, only MEL-dKLA induced apoptosis in CD206 -like TAMs, and MEL did not induce cell death.Taken together, our study demonstrated that MEL-dKLA could be used to target -like TAMs as a promising cancer therapeutic agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30429378>A nanoparticle-incorporated STING activator enhances antitumor immunity in PD-L1-insensitive models of triple-negative breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has few therapeutic options, and alternative approaches are urgently needed. Stimulator of IFN genes (STING) is becoming an exciting target for therapeutic adjuvants. However, STING resides inside the cell, and the intracellular delivery of CDNs, such as cGAMP, is required for the optimal activation of STING. We show that liposomal nanoparticle-delivered cGAMP (cGAMP-NP) activates STING more effectively than soluble cGAMP. These particles induce innate and adaptive host immune responses to preexisting tumors in both orthotopic and genetically engineered models of basal-like TNBC. cGAMP-NPs also reduce melanoma tumor load, with limited responsivity to anti-PD-L1. Within the tumor microenvironment, cGAMP-NPs direct both mouse and human macrophages (M), reprograming from protumorigenic -like phenotype toward M1-like phenotype; enhance MHC and costimulatory molecule expression; reduce  biomarkers; increase IFN-γ-producing T cells; augment tumor apoptosis; and increase CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Activated T cells are required for tumor suppression, as their depletion reduces antitumor activity. Importantly, cGAMP-NPs prevent the formation of secondary tumors, and a single dose is sufficient to inhibit TNBC. These data suggest that a minimal system comprised of cGAMP-NP alone is sufficient to modulate the tumor microenvironment to effectively control PD-L1-insensitive TNBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120725>Combining Nanomedicine and .</a></h2><p>Nanomedicine holds significant potential to improve the efficacy of cancer . Thus far, nanomedicines, i.e., 1-100(0) nm sized drug delivery systems, have been primarily used to improve the balance between the efficacy and toxicity of conjugated or entrapped chemotherapeutic drugs. The clinical performance of cancer nanomedicines has been somewhat disappointing, which is arguably mostly due to the lack of tools and technologies for patient stratification. Conversely, the clinical progress made with  has been spectacular, achieving complete cures and inducing long-term survival in advanced-stage patients. Unfortunately, however,  only works well in relatively small subsets of patients. Increasing amounts of preclinical and clinical data demonstrate that combining nanomedicine with  can boost therapeutic outcomes, by turning "cold" nonimmunoresponsive tumors and metastases into "hot" immunoresponsive lesions. Nano- can be realized via three different approaches, in which nanomedicines are used (1) to target cancer cells, (2) to target the tumor immune microenvironment, and (3) to target the peripheral immune system. When targeting cancer cells, nanomedicines typically aim to induce immunogenic cell death, thereby triggering the release of tumor antigens and danger-associated molecular patterns, such as calreticulin translocation, high mobility group box 1 protein and adenosine triphosphate. The latter serve as adjuvants to alert antigen-presenting cells to take up, process and present the former, thereby promoting the generation of CD8 cytotoxic T cells. Nanomedicines targeting the tumor immune microenvironment potentiate cancer  by inhibiting immunosuppressive cells, such as -like tumor-associated macrophages, as well as by reducing the expression of immunosuppressive molecules, such as transforming growth factor beta. In addition, nanomedicines can be employed to promote the activity of antigen-presenting cells and cytotoxic T cells in the tumor immune microenvironment. Nanomedicines targeting the peripheral immune system aim to enhance antigen presentation and cytotoxic T cell production in secondary lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes and spleen, as well as to engineer and strengthen peripheral effector immune cell populations, thereby promoting anticancer immunity. While the majority of immunomodulatory nanomedicines are in preclinical development, exciting results have already been reported in initial clinical trials. To ensure efficient translation of nano- constructs and concepts, we have to consider biomarkers in their clinical development, to make sure that the right nanomedicine formulation is combined with the right  in the right patient. In this context, we have to learn from currently ongoing efforts in nano-biomarker identification as well as from partially already established immuno-biomarker initiatives, such as the Immunoscore and the cancer immunogram. Together, these protocols will help to capture the nano-immuno status in individual patients, enabling the identification and use of individualized and improved nanomedicine-based treatments to boost the performance of cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30174934>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) causing acquired resistance to afatinib in a patient with epidermal growth factor receptor ()-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>We report the first case of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as the cause of acquired resistance to the second-generation -tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), afatinib in a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring a sensitizing  mutation.

Despite the prognostic impact of TILs, response to checkpoint-inhibitors and antigen-specific active  is limited in ovarian cancer. The goal of our study was to investigate the interaction between ovarian cancer and the innate and adaptive immune system in the ID8-fLuc syngeneic ovarian cancer mouse model. For the  experiments C57BL/6, B6.129S7-Rag1/J, and B6.129P2(SJL)-Myd88/J mice were inoculated with ID8-fLuc.  depletion experiments were performed using clodronate liposomes (CL), anti-CD8a, anti-GR1, anti-colony stimulating factor 1 (anti-CSF1), and TMβ1 (anti-CD122). Immune read out was performed by fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis for effector T cells, regulatory T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, macrophages, and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), immunohistochemistry for MDSC and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and immunofluorescence for M1 and  TAM in the vascular context. The effect of MDSC on T cell proliferation and phenotype were studied . We discovered that the absence of T and B cells did not influence tumor growth or survival of B6.129S7-Rag1/J mice compared to immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. CL-induced macrophage depletion promoted tumor proliferation and shortened survival in C57BL/6 mice ( = 0.004) and in B6.129S7-Rag1/J mice ( = 0.0005). During CL treatment, we observed a clear increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( ≤ 0.02) and monocytic MDSC ( ≤ 0.01). Selective depletion of MDSC by anti-GR1 improved survival, certainly in comparison to mice treated with anti-CSF1 ( = 0.01-median survival 91 vs. 67.5 days). B6.129P2(SJL)-Myd88/J mice displayed to a longer median survival compared to C57BL/6 mice (90 vs. 76 days). MDSC activated by ID8-fLuc conditioned medium or ascites of tumor-bearing mice showed T cell suppressive functions . Based on these findings, we conclude that the adaptive immune system does not efficiently control tumor growth in the ID8-fLuc model. In addition, we discovered a prominent role for MDSC as the driver of immunosuppression in the ID8-fLuc ovarian cancer mouse model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29430819>Intranasal Nanovaccine Confers Homo- and Hetero-Subtypic Influenza Protection.</a></h2><p>Cross-protective and non-invasively administered vaccines are attractive and highly desired for the control of influenza. Self-assembling nanotechnology provides an opportunity for the development of vaccines with superior performance. In this study, an intranasal nanovaccine is developed targeting the conserved ectodomain of influenza matrix protein 2(M2e). 3-sequential repeats of M2e (3M2e) is presented on the self-assembling recombinant human heavy chain ferritin (rHF) cage to form the 3M2e-rHF nanoparticle. Intranasal vaccination with 3M2e-rHF nanoparticles in the absence of an adjuvant induces robust immune responses, including high titers of sera M2e-specific IgG antibodies, T-cell immune responses, and mucosal secretory-IgA antibodies in mice. The 3M2e-rHF nanoparticles also confer complete protection against a lethal infection of homo-subtypic H1N1 and hetero-subtypic H9N2 virus. An analysis of the mechanism of protection underlying the intranasal immunization with the 3M2e-rHF nanoparticle indicates that M2e-specific mucosal secretory-IgA and T-cell immune responses may play critical roles in the prevention of infection. The results suggest that the 3M2e-rHF nanoparticle is a promising, needle-free, intranasally administered, cross-protective influenza vaccine. The use of self-assembling nanovaccines could be an ideal strategy for developing vaccines with characteristics such as high immunogenicity, cross-protection, and convenient administration, as well as being economical and suitable for large-scale production.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the lungs, T cells protect against respiratory infections, but wane more quickly than T cells in other tissues. This lack of a sustained T population in the lung parenchyma explains, at least in part, why infections with some pathogens, such as influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), recur throughout life. Intranasal (IN) vaccination with a murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) vector expressing the M protein of RSV (MCMV-M) has been shown to elicit robust populations of CD8 T cells that accumulate over time and mediate early viral clearance. To extend this finding, we compared the inflationary CD8 T cell population elicited by MCMV-M vaccination with a conventional CD8 T cell population elicited by an MCMV vector expressing the  protein of RSV (MCMV-). Vaccination with MCMV- induced a population of -specific CD8 T cells that waned rapidly, akin to the -specific CD8 T cell population elicited by infection with RSV. In contrast to the natural immunodominance profile, however, coadministration of MCMV-M and MCMV- did not suppress the M-specific CD8 T cell response, suggesting that progressive expansion was driven by continuous antigen presentation, irrespective of the competitive or regulatory effects of -specific CD8 T cells. Moreover, effective viral clearance mediated by M-specific CD8 T cells was not affected by the coinduction of -specific CD8 T cells. These data show that memory inflation is required for the maintenance of CD8 T cells in the lungs after IN vaccination with MCMV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30054993>Reemergence of H3N8 Equine Influenza A virus in Chile, 2018.</a></h2><p>A new outbreak of equine Influenza A virus (IAV) was reported in Chile in January 2018, 6 years after its last report in 2012.

Identifying new immunomodulatory therapies to promote the supportive aspect of immune response is critically needed for the treatment of SCI. We previously demonstrated that SCI results in acute and permanent depletion of the neuronally derived Neuregulin-1 (Nrg-1) in the spinal cord. Increasing the dysregulated level of Nrg-1 through acute intrathecal Nrg-1 treatment enhanced endogenous cell replacement and promoted white matter preservation and functional recovery in rat SCI. Moreover, we identified a neuroprotective role for Nrg-1 in moderating the activity of resident astrocytes and microglia following injury. To date, the impact of Nrg-1 on immune response in SCI has not yet been investigated. In this study, we elucidated the effect of systemic Nrg-1 therapy on the recruitment and function of macrophages, T cells, and B cells, three major leukocyte populations involved in neuroinflammatory processes following SCI.We utilized a clinically relevant model of moderately severe compressive SCI in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Nrg-1 (2 μg/day) or saline was delivered subcutaneously through osmotic mini-pumps starting 30 min after SCI. We conducted flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry at acute, subacute, and chronic stages of SCI to investigate the effects of Nrg-1 treatment on systemic and spinal cord immune response as well as cytokine, chemokine, and antibody production.We provide novel evidence that Nrg-1 promotes a pro-regenerative immune response after SCI. Bioavailability of Nrg-1 stimulated a regulatory phenotype in T and B cells and augmented the population of  macrophages in the spinal cord and blood during the acute and chronic stages of SCI. Importantly, Nrg-1 fostered a more balanced microenvironment in the injured spinal cord by attenuating antibody deposition and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines while upregulating pro-regenerative mediators.We provide the first evidence of a significant regulatory role for Nrg-1 in neuroinflammation after SCI.

In addition, its expression in tumor cells modulates tumor cell adhesion, metastasis, and apoptosis. Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive neoplasm of the mesothelial cells lining the pleural and peritoneal cavities, and in this study, we found that both human MM tissues and mouse MM cells express high levels of galectin-9. Using a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Clone P4D2) that binds the C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of galectin-9, we demonstrate unique agonistic properties resulting in MM cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the P4D2 mAb reduced tumor-associated macrophages differentiation toward a protumor phenotype. Importantly, these effects exerted by the P4D2 mAb were observed in both human and mouse  experiments and not observed with another antigalectin-9 specific mAb (clone P1D9) that engages the N-terminus CRD of galectin-9. In syngeneic murine models of MM, P4D2 mAb treatment inhibited tumor growth and improved survival, with tumors from P4D2-treated mice exhibited reduced infiltration of tumor-associated  macrophages. This was consistent with an increased production of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which is a major enzyme-regulating macrophage inflammatory response to cancer. These data suggest that using an antigalectin 9 mAb with agonistic properties similar to those exerted by galectin-9 may provide a novel multitargeted strategy for the treatment of mesothelioma and possibly other galectin-9 expressing tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660463>Liposomal CpG-ODN: An in vitro and in vivo study on macrophage subtypes responses, biodistribution and subsequent therapeutic efficacy in mice models of cancers.</a></h2><p>CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN), a common immune stimulator and vaccine adjuvant, was reported to switch Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs) from  to M1 phenotype inducing anti-tumor responses. Liposomes are of the successfully applied carriers for CpG-ODN. The aim of present study was design and preparation of a liposomal formulation containing phosphodiester CpG-ODN, evaluation of its effect on macrophages responses, and subsequent antitumor responses in mice. Liposomal formulations containing phosphodiester CpG-ODN or non-CpG-ODN were prepared and characterized. MTT reduction assay in four different cell lines, uptake, arginase and iNOS activity evaluation in macrophage cell lines, biodistribution study and therapeutic anti-tumor effects of formulations in mice bearing C26 colon carcinoma or B16F0 melanoma were carried out. The size of liposomes containing CpG-ODN was ~200 nm with the encapsulation efficiency of 33%. The iNOS activity assay showed high nitric oxide (NO) level in  phenotype of macrophage cell lines treated by liposomes containing CpG-ODN. In mice which received liposomes containing CpG-ODN as a monotherapy, maximum tumor growth delay with remarkable survival improvement was observed compared to control groups. Biodistribution study showed the accumulation of liposomal formulation in tumor micro-environment. In conclusion, considerable anti-tumor responses observed by liposomes containing CpG-ODN was due to enhanced delivery of CpG-ODN to immune cells and subsequent initiation of anti-tumoral immune responses.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Different next-generation approaches such as cell line-based culture, reverse genetics, and virus expression technology are currently under development to address the aforementioned challenges in conventional vaccine manufacture pipeline. Such approaches hope for safe and scalable production, induce broad-spectrum immunity, create premade libraries of vaccine strains, and target nonvariable regions of antigenic proteins for "universal" vaccination.

As the most abundant immune cells in TME, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play nonredundant roles in restricting antitumor immunity. The leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (Lgr4, also known as Gpr48) has been associated with multiple physiologic and pathologic functions. Lgr4 and its ligands R-spondin 1-4 have been shown to promote the growth and metastasis of tumor cells. However, whether Lgr4 can promote tumor progression by regulating the function of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Lgr4 promotes macrophage  polarization through Rspo/Lgr4/Erk/Stat3 signaling. Notably, urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), and B16F10 melanoma tumors were all markedly reduced in Lgr4Lyz2 mice, characterized by fewer protumoral  TAMs and increased CD8 T lymphocyte infiltration in the TME. Furthermore, LLC tumor growth was greatly depressed when Rspo/Lgr4/Erk/Stat3 signaling was blocked with either the LGR4 extracellular domain or an anti-Rspo1 antibody. Importantly, blocking Rspo-Lgr4 signaling overcame LLC resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy and improved the efficacy of PD-1  against B16F10 melanoma, indicating vital roles of Rspo-Lgr4 in host antitumor immunity and a potential therapeutic target in cancer .

MOPC-315 cell lines were injected subcutaneously to establish myeloma-bearing mice and the following five test groups were established: PBS control, DCs, DCs + lenalidomide, DCs + PD-1 blockade, and DCs + lenalidomide + PD-1 blockade. The combination of DCs plus lenalidomide and PD-1 blockade more potently inhibited tumor growth compared to the other groups. This effect was associated with a reduction in immune suppressor cells (such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells,  macrophages, and regulatory T cells) and an increase in immune effector cells [such as CD4 and CD8 T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and M1 macrophages] in the spleen. Functional activities of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells were also enhanced by the triple combination. Levels of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-β and IL-10, were significantly reduced in the tumor microenvironment. These findings suggest that the combination of DCs plus lenalidomide and PD-1 blockade synergistically establishes a robust anti-myeloma immunity through a two-way mechanism, which inhibits immunosuppressive cells while activating effector cells with superior polarization of the Th1/Th2 balance in favor of the tumor immune response. This result should provide an experimental ground for incorporating check point inhibitors to existing immunotherapeutic modalities against multiple myeloma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29410946>Tumor-Associated Macrophages: Therapeutic Targets for Skin Cancer.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are significant components of the microenvironment of solid tumors in the majority of cancers. TAMs sequentially develop from monocytes into functional macrophages. In each differentiation stage, TAMs obtain various immunosuppressive functions to maintain the tumor microenvironment (e.g., expression of immune checkpoint molecules, production of Treg-related chemokines and cytokines, production of arginase I). Although the main population of TAMs is immunosuppressive  macrophages, TAMs can be modulated into M1-type macrophages in each differential stage, leading to the suppression of tumor growth. Because the administration of certain drugs or stromal factors can stimulate TAMs to produce specific chemokines, leading to the recruitment of various tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, TAMs can serve as targets for cancer . In this review, we discuss the differentiation, activation, and immunosuppressive function of TAMs, as well as their benefits in cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118632>Drug-free mannosylated liposomes inhibit tumor growth by promoting the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages.</a></h2><p> Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are critical in tumor progression and metastasis. Selective targeting of TAMs holds great potential to ameliorate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhance the efficacy of antitumor therapy. Various liposomes have been developed to target TAMs via cell-specific surface receptors either to deplete or re-educate TAMs. Since immuno-stimulation often initiates with the interaction of nanocarriers with the innate immunity cells such as macrophages, the intrinsic impact of drug-free liposomes on macrophage activation and polarization via cell interaction is one of the most critical issues in nanomedicine for promoting effective .  In this study, conventional bare liposomes, PEGylated liposomes, and mannosylated liposomes were developed and the cytotoxicity, cellular internalization, immunostimulatory activity, targeting efficiency, antitumor efficacy, and mechanism were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.  All liposomes displayed an ideal particle size, good biocompatibility, and controlled release behavior. Mannosylated liposomes exhibited superior in vitro cellular internalization and tumor spheroid penetration with the aid of the mannose receptor-mediated TAMs-targeting effects. In particular, mannosylated liposomes promoted the polarization of both M0 and  to the M1 phenotype by enhancing the expression ratio of CD86/CD206 in vitro. Of note, mannosylated liposomes could inhibit G422 glioma tumor growth, which may be attributed to the polarization of TAMs, as evidenced by the reduction in expression level of the TAMs surface marker.  These results indicate the potential value of mannosylated liposomes in the design of a rational delivery system to enhance the antitumor immune efficacy of immunomodulators by inducing a shift from the  to the M1 phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447857>The Human G Protein-Coupled ATP Receptor P2Y Is Associated With IL-10 Driven Macrophage Differentiation.</a></h2><p>The G protein-coupled P2Y receptor is known to sense extracellular ATP during inflammatory and immune responses. The dinucleotide NAD has also been proposed to be a P2Y receptor ligand but its role is less clear. Here, we have examined for the first time human P2Y receptor protein levels and show that the receptor was upregulated during polarization of  macrophages. IL-10 reinforced P2Y receptor expression during differentiation of M2c macrophages expressing CD163, CD16, and CD274 (PD-L1). Nutlin-3a mediated p53 stabilization further increased P2Y receptor, CD16, and PD-L1 expression. AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which mediates anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10, and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD salvage pathway, which is under the control of AMPK, were also required for P2Y receptor expression. The P2Y receptor agonist ATPγS and NAD could independently stimulate the production of IL-8 in  macrophages, however, only the ATPγS-induced response was mediated by P2Y receptor. Both in a recombinant system and in macrophages, P2Y receptor-driven IL-8 production predominantly depended on IkB kinase (IKK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). In conclusion, our data indicate that an AMPK-NAMPT-NAD signaling axis promotes P2Y receptor expression during  polarization of human macrophages in response to IL-10. PD-L1 expressing M2c macrophages that secrete the cancer-promoting chemokine IL-8 in response to P2Y receptor stimulation may represent an important target in checkpoint blockade .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609000>Molecular and clinical characterization of Galectin-9 in glioma through 1,027 samples.</a></h2><p>In recent years, research on glioma  have grown rapidly. However, the autoimmune-like side effects that are caused by blocking immunological checkpoints hinder their clinical application in gliomas currently. Galectin-9, a ligand for T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 3, has shed a new light on the treatment of malignant glioma. However, the potential mechanism of Galectin-9 is still under discussion. In this study, first, we methodically gathered 1,027 glioma patients with RNA-seq and 986 patients with survival data to explore the role and mechanism of Galectin-9 in gliomas. Second, we analyzed glioma samples from 50 patients in the Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital. Finally, we found that Galectin-9 was strongly upregulated in glioblastoma multiforme compared with normal brain tissues and lower-grade glioma. Patients with Galectin-9 overexpression had a significantly shorter overall survival. Moreover, the tissue microarray data displayed that the expression of Galectin-9 in the core of tumor is higher than that in the border and was correlated with the shorter survival in glioma patients. Galectin-9 is more highly expressed in the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma multiforme than in the other subtypes. Simultaneously, Galectin-9 was closely associated with the immune response and lymphocyte activation, especially T-cell activation. To further determine the underlying role of Galectin-9 in the immune response, we selected seven immune metagenes. Through cluster analysis and correlation analysis, we discovered that Galectin-9 was highly correlated with immune checkpoint molecules and  tumor-associated macrophages. In summary, Galectin-9 serves as a potential therapeutic target to treat glioblastoma multiforme.© 2019 The Authors.

This in turn results in metabolic shift and cellular stress, which is caused by the accumulation and trafficking of these proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To resolve this, cells trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is mainly mediated by binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP)/glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) chaperone, and this in turn upregulates its transcription. This chaperone protein facilitates proper protein folding within the ER; however, it can also be passively secreted into the extracellular environment or be expressed on cell surfaces attached to anchor proteins and transmembrane proteins. This notion has been shown in studies on chronic inflammation, including cancer and arthritis, with the detection of BiP-specific antibodies from different sample types. The present study analysed secreted BiP from plasma samples collected from healthy participants and patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis (TBdx), seen over the course of TB treatment at week 1 (W1), month 2 (), and month 6 (M6). The results revealed that during the initial TB disease and treatment period, cells are subjected to stress conditions resulting in metabolic shifts, which lead to the secretion of the intracellular UPR-mediating chaperone protein, BiP. This was indicated by mean differences between TBdx (mean 40.88ng/ml) and W1 (68.57ng/ml) in the TB participant groups. However, no difference was observed between the healthy group (mean 42.64ng/ml) and TBdx group (mean 40.88ng/ml). Analysis of paired time-point visits revealed increased BiP secretion during early TB treatment. The detection of BiP in plasma samples was found to decrease after successful TB treatment to levels comparable to those in the healthy controls. Evaluation of BiP levels in larger TB treatment studies may lead to the identification of a new target for early TB diagnosis and host-directed .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Current methods to study TAM have not been replicated across cancer types and often do not include exogenous growth factors from the tumor, a key factor in TAM differentiation in vivo.In this study, an in vitro method to generate monocyte- derived TAM using tumor- conditioned media (TCM) and a cytokine cocktail containing IL-4, IL-10, and M-CSF was utilized to study the phenotype, morphology, and function of TAM across multiple cancer types. TCM was generated from two breast cancer cell lines and an Epstein-Barr virus-positive lymphoma cell line. The properties of in vitro generated TAM were compared to in vitro generated M1 and - like macrophages and TAM isolated from patients with cancer.TAM generated in this fashion displayed an increase in CD163/CD206 co-expression compared to - like macrophages (87 and 36%, respectively). TAM generated in vitro exhibited increased transcript levels of the functional markers IL-6, IL-10, CCL2, c-Myc, iNOS, and arginase compared to in vitro generated -like macrophages. Functionally, in vitro generated TAM inhibited the proliferation of T cells (47% decrease from M1-like macrophages) and the production of IFN-γ by natural killer cells was inhibited (44%) when co-cultured with TAM. Furthermore, in vitro generated TAM secreted soluble factors that promote the growth and survival of tumor cells.Limited access to patient TAM highlights the need for methods to generate TAM in vitro. Our data confirm that monocyte-derived TAM can be generated reliably using TCM plus the cytokine cocktail of IL-4, IL-10, and M-CSF. Given the ability of TAM to inhibit immune cell function, continued study of methods to deplete or deactivate TAM in the setting of cancer are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547048> (PG2) Enhances the M1 Polarization of Macrophages, Functional Maturation of Dendritic Cells, and T Cell-Mediated Anticancer Immune Responses in Patients with Lung Cancer.</a></h2><p>Recently, we demonstrated that  (PG2), the active ingredient in dried roots of  ameliorates cancer symptom clusters and improves quality of life (QoL) in patients with metastatic disease by modulating inflammatory cascade against the background roles of inflammatory cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumor initiation, metastasis, and progression. Nevertheless, the role of PG2 in the modulation of anticancer immunogenicity and therapeutic response remains relatively underexplored and unclear.The present study investigates how and to what extent PG2 modulates cellular and biochemical components of the inflammatory cascade and enhances anticancer immunity, as well as the therapeutic implication of these bio-events in patients with lung cancer.Herein, we demonstrated that PG2 significantly increased the M1/ macrophage polarization ratio in non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) H441 and H1299 cells. This PG2-induced preferential pharmacologic up-regulation of tumoral M1 population in vitro positively correlated with the downregulation of tumor-promoting IL-6 and IL-10 expression in NSCLC cell-conditioned medium, with concomitant marked inhibition of cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and tumorsphere formation. Our ex vivo results, using clinical sample from our NSCLC cohort, demonstrated that PG2 also promoted the functional maturation of DCs with consequent enhancement of T cell-mediated anticancer immune responses. Consistent with the in vitro and ex vivo results, our in vivo studies showed that treatment with PG2 elicited significant time-dependent depletion of the tumor-associated  population, synergistically enhanced the anti--based anticancer effect of cisplatin, and inhibited xenograft tumor growth in the NSCLC mice models. Moreover, in the presence of PG2, cisplatin-associated dyscrasia and weight-loss was markedly suppressed.These results do indicate a therapeutically-relevant role for PG2 in modulating the M1/ macrophage pool, facilitating DC maturation and synergistically enhancing the anticancer effect of conventional chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin, thus laying the foundation for further exploration of the curative relevance of PG2 as surrogate  and/or clinical feasibility of its use for maintenance therapy in patients with lung cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29872624>Biomimetic albumin-modified gold nanorods for photothermo-chemotherapy and macrophage polarization modulation.</a></h2><p>Nanotechnology-based photothermal therapy has attracted great attention in the past decade. Nevertheless, photothermal therapy has some inherent drawbacks, such as the uneven heat production and limited laser penetration, often leading to insufficient treatment outcomes. Here, we developed a combination strategy to improve cancer therapy. The biomimetic albumin-modified gold nanorods (AuNRs) were prepared with incorporation of paclitaxel (PTX). This therapeutic system was characterized by several features. First, the albumin modification enhanced the biocompatibility and colloidal stability. Second, the surface-coated albumin promoted cellular uptake  the albumin-binding protein pathway. Third, PTX was incorporated  hydrophobic interaction between PTX and the albumin lipophilic domain. Fourth, the system can be used for combined photothermo-chemotherapy for yielding synergistic effects. The antitumor activity of the system was evaluated both  and  using the HCT116 colon cancer cell and tumor model. The combination therapy was found with an enhanced treatment efficiency and no obvious side effect. Most importantly, the thermal effect was also discovered with the ability to modulate the tumor microenvironments and suppress the macrophages polarization towards the  pro-tumor phenotype. It could be a mechanism for photothermal .

Tumor heterogeneity that often leads to distinct functional phenotypes contributes to glioblastoma (GB) indispensable growth and aggressiveness. The complex interaction of neoplastic cells with tumor microenvironment (TME) along with the presence of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) largely confers to extrinsic and intrinsic GB heterogeneity. Recent data indicate that glioma cells secrete a variety of soluble immunoregulatory factors to attract different cell types to TME including astrocytes, endothelial cells, circulating stem cells, and a range of immune cells. These further induce a local production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors which upon crosstalk with extracellular matrix (ECM) components reprogram immune cells to inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotypes and manipulate host's immune response in favor of cancer growth and metastasis. Herein, we provide an overview of the immunobiologic factors that orchestrate the complex network of glioma cells and TME interactions in an effort to identify potential therapeutic targets for GB malignancy. Current therapeutic schemes and advances in targeting GB-TME crosstalk are further discussed. KEY MESSAGES: • Intrinsic and extrinsic tumor heterogeneity affects GB growth and aggressiveness. • GB cells secrete growth factors and chemoattractants to recruit immune cells to TME. • GAMs are a critical cell type in promoting GB growth. • GAMs change from pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor M1 phenotype to pro-tumorigenic . • Novel therapeutic agents target the crosstalk of neoplastic cells with TME.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30197360>Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 downregulation in J774A.1 cell line as a model of  macrophages in tumor microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a decisive role in the regulation of tumor progression by manipulating tumor oncogenesis, angiogenesis, and immune functions within tumor microenvironments. Tumor progression is frequently associated with a phenotypic switch from M1 to  in TAM. Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in TAM lead to tumor-induced immunosuppression. STAT3 is usually constitutively activated in a variety of malignancies. Consequently, STAT3 has emerged as a promising target for cancer .In this study, J774A.1 cell line which is an  macrophage and overexpress STAT3 was cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented by fetal bovine serum. Then, the STAT3 silencing was evaluated by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using oligofectamine containing STAT3 short interfering RNA (siRNA). Oligofectamine containing STAT3 siRNA and control siRNA were added at a final concentration of 100 nM siRNA. The untransfected cells were considered as control group.The semi-quantitative RT-PCR studies showed that J774A.1 cells express a high level of STAT3. Incubation of J774A.1 cells with oligofectamine containing STAT3 siRNA knockdown the STAT3 expression significantly both in 48 and 72 h study; however, the effect was more pronounced in 72 h study.The expression of STAT3 in J774A.1 cells confirmed that these cells are  macrophage. Moreover, silencing of STAT3 by siRNA delivery using oligofectamine delivery suggests that siRNA delivery using vehicles like nanoliposome could be a useful therapeutic agent in  macrophage therapy and its switch to M1 macrophages. This approach could be considered as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of all cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545600>Nanoparticle Delivery of RIG-I Agonist Enables Effective and Safe Adjuvant Therapy in Pancreatic Cancer.</a></h2><p>Local immunomodulation can be a promising strategy to augment the efficacy and decrease off-target toxicities associated with cancer treatment. Pancreatic cancer is resistant to immunotherapies due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, we investigated a therapeutic approach involving delivery of a short interfering double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), specific to Bcl2, with 5' triphosphate ends, by lipid calcium phosphate nanoparticles, in an orthotopic allograft KPC model of pancreatic cancer. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors can bind to 5' triphosphate dsRNA (ppp dsRNA), a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, producing type I interferon, while Bcl2 silencing can drive apoptosis of cancer cells. Our approach demonstrated a robust enrichment of tumor tissue with therapeutic nanoparticles and enabled a significant tumor growth inhibition, prolonging median overall survival. Nanoparticles encapsulating dual-therapeutic ppp dsRNA allowed strong induction in levels of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines, further increasing proportions of CD8 T cells over regulatory T cells, M1 over  macrophages, and decreased levels of immunosuppressive B regulatory and plasma cells in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, these results provide a new  approach for pancreatic cancer.Copyright © 2018 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The PDA tumor microenvironment contains infiltrating immune cells including cytotoxic T cells; however, there is an overall immunosuppressive milieu. Hypoxia is a known element of the solid tumor microenvironment and may promote tumor survival. Through various mechanisms including, but not limited to, those mediated by HIF-1α, hypoxia also leads to increased tumor proliferation and metabolic changes. Furthermore, epithelial to mesenchymal transition is promoted through several pathways, including NOTCH and c-MET, regulated by hypoxia. Hypoxia-promoted changes also contribute to the immunosuppressive phenotype seen in many different cell types within the microenvironment and thereby may inhibit an effective immune system response to PDA. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and myofibroblasts appear to contribute to the recruitment of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and B cells in PDA via cytokines increased due to hypoxia. PSCs also increase collagen secretion in response to HIF-1α, which promotes a fibrotic stroma that alters T cell homing and migration. In hypoxic environments, B cells contribute to cytotoxic T cell exhaustion and produce chemokines to attract more immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. MDSCs inhibit T cell metabolism by hoarding key amino acids, modulate T cell homing by cleaving L-selectin, and prevent T cell activation by increasing PD-L1 expression. Immunosuppressive  phenotype macrophages promote T cell anergy via increased nitric oxide (NO) and decreased arginine in hypoxia. Increased numbers of regulatory T cells are seen in hypoxia which prevent effector T cell activation through cytokine production and increased CTLA-4. Effective  for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and other solid tumors will need to help counteract the immunosuppressive nature of hypoxia-induced changes in the tumor microenvironment. Promising studies will look at combination therapies involving checkpoint inhibitors, chemokine inhibitors, and possible targeting of hypoxia. While no model is perfect, assuring that models incorporate the effects of hypoxia on cancer cells, stromal cells, and effector immune cells will be crucial in developing successful therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30176559>Src promotes anti-inflammatory () macrophage generation via the IL-4/STAT6 pathway.</a></h2><p>The balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophage generation, a process known as polarization, is critical for immune homoeostasis. Identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying polarization and the generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages is an area of high current interest. Our previous work has demonstrated that integrin CD11b promotes IL-10 production in macrophages by activating the Sarcoma gene (Src), yet whether and how Src modulates anti-inflammatory macrophages is not known. Here we show that Src inhibitor (Dasatinib)-treated mice were highly susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, with a much more sever inflammation response, accompanying by high TNF-α, and low IL-10 expression. Inhibition of Src enhanced the expression of pro-inflammatory macrophage marker inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), but reduced the expression of anti-inflammatory macrophage marker arginase1 (Arg1) in both intestinal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Overexpression of constitutively activated Src promoted IL-4-induced expression of Arg1 through STAT6 phosphorylation, and Jak1 was also involved in this process. Our results reveal that the IL-4-Src-STAT6 pathway plays a major role in polarizing anti-inflammatory macrophage generation and suggest a potential anti-inflammatory role for Src in inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Certain microRNAs (miRs), such as miR-125b, can reprogram TAMs into an antitumor/pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype. Using CD44 targeting hyaluronic acid-poly(ethylenimine) (HA-PEI)-based nanoparticles encapsulating miR-125b, we have herein shown macrophage-specific delivery and transfection upon intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. We have exploited the inherent ability of peritoneal macrophages to migrate toward the inflammation/injury and demonstrated that following intraperitoneal administration of HA-PEI nanoparticles, there is an accumulation of HA-PEI nanoparticles in the macrophage-ablated lung tissues of both naïve and KRAS/p53 double mutant genetically engineered (KP-GEM) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mouse model. Additionally, upon transfection with miR-125b, we observed a >6-fold increase in the M1 to  macrophage ratio and 300-fold increase in the iNOS (M1 marker)/Arg-1 ( marker) ratio in TAMs as compared to the untreated control group.

In previous studies, fragment selection was mainly based on epitopes and less often on the structure. Fewer studies have paid attention to the prediction of the truncated protein 3D structure and retained its similarity in the native and truncated proteins. Here we used in silico analysis to select two fragments of Pyruvate Kinase  (PKM2), as a tumor marker. One fragment, M-tPKM2, had a shorter sequence with one epitope although the predicted 3D structure was similar to the native PKM2. The other fragment, R-tPKM2, had a longer sequence and thus more epitopes, but had a different structure from the native PKM2. Recombinant truncated proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified via affinity chromatography. Secondary structure elements in purified proteins were determined by Circular Dichroism, then they were utilized to develop antibodies in mice. Both antigens could elicit high immune response against themselves (OD = 3.326 ± 0.562 for M-tPKM2; OD = 3.562 ± 0.110 for R-tPKM2). However, significantly higher response against PKM2 was observed among the mice immunized with M-tPKM2 (p < 0.0001 by One way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc comparison). Also, the monoclonal antibody produced against the M-tPKM2 could recognize the native PKM2 in the MCF7 cells. Our finding suggested that for the purpose of designing an antigen with the ability to produce a potent antibody against the target protein, it is better to select sequences which have a similar structure in truncated and native proteins, even at the cost of having shorter sequences and fewer epitopes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study is to characterize the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein expression and cancer microenvironment profiles in surgically resected eCCA samples. PD-L1 positivity was observed on tumor cells (32.3%) as well as on tumor-associated macrophages (74.2%). PD-L1 expression by eCCA correlated significantly with immune parameters such as intra-tumoral CD3+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) density (P = 0.002), intra-tumoral CD8+ TILs density (P < 0.001), and the expression pattern of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I (P < 0.001). Immunofluorescence showed that PD-L1 positive tumor cells were adjacent to PD-1 positive cells and the stroma covered with interferon-γ. Correlation with clinicopathological parameters and survival analyses revealed that PD-L1 positivity in eCCA was related to the absence of venous invasion (P = 0.030), improved overall survival (P = 0.020) and progressionfree survival (P = 0.011).

The N-terminal fragment of streptococcal M protein elicits protective antibodies and is an attractive vaccine target. However, this N- terminal fragment is hypervariable: there are more than 200 different M types. In this study, an intranasal live bacterial vaccine comprising 10 strains of Lactococcus lactis, each expressing one N-terminal fragment of M protein, has been developed. Live bacterial-vectored vaccines cost less to manufacture because the processes involved are less complex than those required for production of protein subunit vaccines. Moreover, intranasal administration does not require syringes or specialized personnel. Evaluation of individual vaccine types (M1, , M3, M4, M6, M9, M12, M22, M28 and M77) showed that most of them protected mice against challenge with virulent S. pyogenes. All 10 strains combined in a 10-valent vaccine (M×10) induced serum and bronchoalveolar lavage IgG titers that ranged from three- to 10-fold those of unimmunized mice. After intranasal challenge with M28 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice was significantly higher than that of unimmunized mice. In contrast, when mice were challenged with M75 streptococci, survival of M×10-immunized mice did not differ significantly from that of unimmunized mice. Mx-10 immunized mice had significantly less S. pyogenes in oropharyngeal washes and developed less severe disease symptoms after challenge than did unimmunized mice.

We have identified IL-36γ as a key mediator of immune protection during both high- and low-pathogenesis influenza infection.  mRNA is upregulated in the lung following influenza infection, and mice lacking IL-36γ have greatly increased morbidity and mortality upon infection with either H1N1 or H3N2 influenza. The increased severity of influenza infection in IL-36γ-knockout (KO) mice is associated with increased viral titers, higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines early in infection, and more diffuse pathologic conditions late in the disease course. Interestingly, the increased severity of disease in IL-36γ-KO mice correlates with a rapid loss of alveolar macrophages following infection. We find that the alveolar macrophages from naive IL-36γ-KO mice have higher expression of -like surface markers compared with wild-type (WT) mice and show increased apoptosis within 24 h of infection. Finally, transfer of WT alveolar macrophages to IL-36γ-KO mice restores protection against lethal influenza challenge to levels observed in WT mice. Together, these data identify a critical role for IL-36γ in immunity against influenza virus and demonstrate the importance of IL-36γ signaling for alveolar macrophage survival during infection.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30416507>The Pro-tumorigenic IL-33 Involved in Antitumor Immunity: A Yin and Yang Cytokine.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-33 (IL-33), considered as an alarmin released upon tissue stress or damage, is a member of the IL-1 family and binds the ST2 receptor. First described as a potent initiator of type 2 immune responses through the activation of T helper 2 (T2) cells and mast cells, IL-33 is now also known as an effective stimulator of T1 immune cells, natural killer (NK) cells, iNKT cells, and CD8 T lymphocytes. Moreover, IL-33 was shown to play an important role in several cancers due to its pro and anti-tumorigenic functions. Currently, IL-33 is a possible inducer and prognostic marker of cancer development with a direct effect on tumor cells promoting tumorigenesis, proliferation, survival, and metastasis. IL-33 also promotes tumor growth and metastasis by remodeling the tumor microenvironment (TME) and inducing angiogenesis. IL-33 favors tumor progression through the immune system by inducing  macrophage polarization and tumor infiltration, and upon activation of immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) or regulatory T cells. The anti-tumor functions of IL-33 also depend on infiltrated immune cells displaying T1 responses. This review therefore summarizes the dual role of this cytokine in cancer and suggests that new proposals for IL-33-based cancer immunotherapies should be considered with caution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920563>Effect of genetic background and delivery route on the preclinical properties of a live attenuated RSV vaccine.</a></h2><p>A safe and effective vaccine against RSV remains an important unmet public health need. Intranasally (IN) delivered live-attenuated vaccines represent the most extensively studied approach for immunization of RSV-naïve infants and children, however, achieving an effective balance of attenuation and immunogenicity has proven challenging. Here we report pre-clinical immunogenicity and efficacy data utilizing a live-attenuated vaccine candidate, RGΔ-2, which was obtained by deleting the -2 open reading frame from the genome of the MSA1 clinical isolate. Intramuscular (IM) administration of RGΔ-2 in cotton rats induced immunity and protective efficacy that was comparable to that induced by intranasal (IN) immunization. In contrast, the protective efficacy of RGΔ-2 delivered by the IM route to African green monkeys was substantially reduced as compared to the efficacy following IN administration, despite comparable levels of serum neutralizing antibodies. This result suggests that mucosal immunity may play an important role in RSV protection. The RGΔ-2 vaccine also demonstrated different attenuation profiles when tested in cotton rats, non-human primates, and a human airway epithelial (HAE) cell model. The data suggest RGΔ-2 is less attenuated than a similarly designed vaccine candidate constructed on the A2 genetic background. These findings have important implications with regard to both the design and the preclinical safety testing of live-attenuated vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305839>Selective targeting of tumor cells and tumor associated macrophages separately by twin-like core-shell nanoparticles for enhanced tumor-localized chemoimmunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Tumor associated macrophage (TAM)-based  has been presented as a promising strategy in cancer therapy. The combination of TAM-based  with sorafenib (SF) could be conceivably quite more effective in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. A co-delivery system was superior in improving the co-accumulation of two drugs in tumor tissues for chemoimmunotherapy, while in the case of selective targeting of separated cells such as tumor cells and immune cells, a novel targeted co-delivery strategy was badly required. In this study, twin-like core-shell nanoparticles (TCN) were developed for synchronous biodistribution and separated cell targeting delivery of SF and TAM re-polarization agents IMD-0354 to cancer cells and TAM to enhance tumor-localized chemoimmunotherapy, respectively. First of all, SF loaded cationic lipid-based nanoparticles (SF-CLN) and mannose-modified IMD-0354 loaded cationic lipid-based nanoparticles (M-IMD-CLN) were prepared, respectively. SF on the surface of SF-CLN and mannose on the M-IMD-CLN were regarded as targeting ligands for selective targeting delivery of SF-CLN and M-IMD-CLN to cancer cells and TAM separately. Then, pH-responsive charge reversal polymer O-carboxymethyl-chitosan (CMCS) was coated on the SF-CLN and M-IMD-CLN to obtain twin-like CMCS/SF-CLN and CMCS/M-IMD-CLN, respectively. The results of cellular uptake assay on Hepa1-6 cells and RAW 264.7 cells in vitro, respectively, as well as the results of tumor tissue distribution of SF and IMD-0354 in vivo suggested that CMCS/SF-CLN and CMCS/M-IMD-CLN exhibited similar properties in vitro and synchronous biodistribution in vivo, and were efficient at separated cell targeting delivery. What's more, the results of antitumor efficiency in vivo and phenotype analysis of TAM in tumor tissues proved that CMCS/SF-CLN and CMCS/M-IMD-CLN exhibited superior synergistic antitumor efficacy and -type TAM polarization ability compared with SF treatment in Hepa1-6 tumor bearing mice. Consequently, TCN which was the combination of co-administration and nano-drug delivery systems has great potential to be used in tumor-localized chemoimmunotherapy in clinics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30849138>Hyaluronic acid-based extracellular matrix triggers spontaneous -like polarity of monocyte/macrophage.</a></h2><p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is found in various tumor tissues, and is considered tumor-associated extracellular matrix (ECM). Within this tumor-associated ECM, stromal cells, especially immune cells, are involved in tumor progression. However, the effects of tumor-associated ECM on the characteristics of immune cells remain unexplored. Therefore, we studied the triggering effect of HA on spontaneous -like polarity of monocytes/macrophages using HA-mixed collagen (HA-COL) matrix. In the presence of HA, expression of the HA receptor (CD44) and  polarity-related genes was upregulated in human monocytes (THP-1 cells). We confirmed the CD44-mediated activation of STAT3 in THP-1 cells cultured in an HA-rich environment. Furthermore, when we induced the THP-1 cells to differentiate into cells with M1 or  polarity within an HA-rich environment, the HA-rich environment influenced the direction of induction. Our findings might improve understanding of the crosstalk between immune cells and tumor-associated ECM, and facilitate development of tumor  strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613834>Immune defects in pancreatic cancer.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic cancer is resistant to the . This resistance is caused by any of the four immune "defects" that occur in pancreatic cancer, including lack of "high quality" T cells, stromal barriers to T cells getting access to tumor cells, immunosuppressive cells such as  macrophages, myeloid derivative suppressor cells, and T regulatory cells, in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer.

However, there are two main challenges in successfully utilizing macrophages for . First, macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) secreted by cancer cells binds to colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1-R) on macrophages and in turn activates the downstream signaling pathway responsible for polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to immunosuppressive  phenotype. Second, ligation of signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) expressed on myeloid cells to CD47, a transmembrane protein overexpressed on cancer cells, activates the Src homology region 2 (SH2) domain -phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 in macrophages. This results in activation of "eat-me-not" signaling pathway and inhibition of phagocytosis. Here, it is reported that self-assembled dual-inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles (DNTs) target  macrophages and simultaneously inhibit CSF1R and SHP2 pathways. This results in efficient repolarization of  macrophages to an active M1 phenotype, and superior phagocytic capabilities as compared to individual drug treatments. Furthermore, suboptimal dose administration of DNTs in highly aggressive breast cancer and melanoma mouse models show enhanced anti-tumor efficacy without any toxicity. These studies demonstrate that the concurrent inhibition of CSF1-R and SHP2 signaling pathways for macrophage activation and phagocytosis enhancement could be an effective strategy for macrophage-based .© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We determined expression and regulation of these molecules in human conjunctival melanoma (CM) samples, cell lines, and murine xenografts.Immunofluorescence staining was performed to examine the expression of HLA-A, HLA-B/C, and β-2-microglobulin (B2M) in 23 primary CM samples. HLA class I expression was compared with clinicopathologic characteristics, the presence of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, and PD-L1/PD-1 status. The effect of interferon γ (IFN-γ) on HLA class I expression was tested on three CM cell lines using quantitative PCR and flow cytometry. Furthermore, HLA class I expression was determined in CM cell line-derived murine xenografts.One third of tumors had positive HLA-A, HLA-B/C, and B2M expression. A positive expression was especially seen in thin and epibulbar tumors but was not associated with recurrences. HLA class I expression was correlated with  macrophage density and tended to associate with CD8+ T-cell density but was independent of PD-L1 or PD-1 expression. IFN-γ upregulated HLA class I expression and genes involved in HLA transcription and transportation on CM cell lines. Murine xenografts showed a comparable HLA class I expression as their respective cell lines.Our data indicate that subsets of CM have positive HLA class I expression, and HLA class I and PD-L1/PD-1 are expressed independently. When one considers , one should also analyze HLA class I expression, whose downregulation can limit the efficacy of T cell-mediated therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525385>Towards dewetting monoclonal antibodies for therapeutical purposes.</a></h2><p>Dewetting transition - a concept borrowed from fluid mechanics - is a physiological process that takes place inside the hydrophobic pores of ion channels. This transient phenomenon causes a metastable state that forbids water molecules to cross microscopic receptor cavities. This leads to a decreased conductance, a closure of the pore and, subsequently, severe impairment of cellular performance. We suggest that artificially-provoked dewetting transition in ion channel hydrophobic pores might stand for a molecular candidate to erase detrimental organisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. We describe a novel type of high-affinity monoclonal antibody, that: a) targets specific trans-membrane receptor structures of harmful or redundant cells; b) is equipped with lipophilic and/or hydrophobic fragments that prevent physiological water flow inside ion channels. Therefore, we achieve an artificial dewetting transition inside receptor cavities, that causes discontinuity within transmembrane ionic flows, channel blockage, and subsequent damage of morbid cells. As an example, we describe dewetting monoclonal antibodies that target the  channel of the Influenza A virus: they might prevent water from entering pores thus leading to virion impairment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the safety of administrating the demethylating agent decitabine by hepatic arterial infusionin patients with unresectable liver meta stases from solid tumours in a dose escalation phase I clinical trial. A total of nine eligible patients were enrolled and initiated study treatment at three different dose levels (two patients at 10, four at 15 and six at a dose level of 20mg decitabine//day) (per protocol there was no intent to escalate the dose above the median tolerated intravenous dose level). Decitabine was administered as a 1-hour hepatic arterial infusion on five consecutive days every 4 weeks. Intrapatient dose escalation was applied in five patients. Grades 1 and 2 haematological toxicity was the most frequent treatment-related adverse event. None of the patients experienced treatment-limiting adverse events. Expression analysis of 30 cancer test is antigens (CTA) in pretreatment and post-treatment biopsies from patients indicated an increased expression of 21 CTAs after treatment. There were no objective tumour responses on study treatment or during post study exposure to immune checkpoint therapy in four patients with uveal melanoma liver metastases. We conclude that the investigate d hepatic arterial administration regimen for decitabine can be safely applied, and a dose level of 20 mg//day on five consecutive days every 4 weeks can be considered for further investigation in combinatorial  regimens..</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509725>Advances and Challenges of Nanoparticle-Based Macrophage Reprogramming for Cancer .</a></h2><p>Despite the progress of modern medicine, oncological diseases are still among the most common causes of death of adult populations in developed countries. The current therapeutic approaches are imperfect, and the high mortality of oncological patients under treatment, the lack of personalized strategies, and severe side effects arising as a result of treatment force seeking new approaches to therapy of malignant tumors. During the last decade, cancer , an approach that relies on activation of the host antitumor immune response, has been actively developing. Cancer  is the most promising trend in contemporary fundamental and practical oncology, and restoration of the pathologically altered tumor microenvironment is one of its key tasks, in particular, the reprogramming of tumor macrophages from the immunosuppressive -phenotype into the proinflammatory M1-phenotype is pivotal for eliciting antitumor response.

Poly(l-glutamic acid)-combretastatin A4 conjugate (PLG-CA4) is a novel class of VDAs. Though it has notable antitumor activity, it can induce host immune responses that promote tumor growth. Here, PLG-CA4 induces the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward the -like phenotype in 4T1 metastatic breast cancer (Control 30% vs PLG-CA4 53%;  < 0.05). Compared to the monotherapy of PLG-CA4, inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) attenuates the immunosuppressive effect of PLG-CA4 treatment by decreasing the number of -like TAMs (2.0 × 10 to 1.5 × 10 per tumor) and potential enhancement of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (3.0 × 10 to 5.7 × 10 per tumor). Importantly, PI3Kγ inhibitor synergizing with PLG-CA4 significantly extends the mean survival time from 52 days in monotherapy-treated mice to 61.8 days. Additionally, the combination of PLG-CA4 and PI3Kγ inhibitor improves the tumor therapeutic effect of NLG919, an inhibitor of immune checkpoint indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). As far as it is known, this is the first demonstrated study that VDAs induce the reshaping of macrophages to the -like phenotype. The findings also indicate a potential therapeutic strategy of the combination VDAs with an accurate immune modifier in the tumor to reverse the immune resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29875777>Blockade of MIF-CD74 Signalling on Macrophages and Dendritic Cells Restores the Antitumour Immune Response Against Metastatic Melanoma.</a></h2><p>Mounting an effective immune response against cancer requires the activation of innate and adaptive immune cells. Metastatic melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. While immunotherapies have shown a remarkable success in melanoma treatment, patients develop resistance by mechanisms that include the establishment of an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, understanding how metastatic melanoma cells suppress the immune system is vital to develop effective immunotherapies against this disease. In this study, we find that macrophages (MOs) and dendritic cells (DCs) are suppressed in metastatic melanoma and that the Ig-CDR-based peptide C36L1 is able to restore MOs and DCs' antitumorigenic and immunogenic functions and to inhibit metastatic growth in lungs. Specifically, C36L1 treatment is able to repolarize -like immunosuppressive MOs into M1-like antitumorigenic MOs, and increase the number of immunogenic DCs, and activated cytotoxic T cells, while reducing the number of regulatory T cells and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells in metastatic lungs. Mechanistically, we find that C36L1 directly binds to the MIF receptor CD74 which is expressed on MOs and DCs, disturbing CD74 structural dynamics and inhibiting MIF signaling on these cells. Interfering with MIF-CD74 signaling on MOs and DCs leads to a decrease in the expression of immunosuppressive factors from MOs and an increase in the capacity of DCs to activate cytotoxic T cells. Our findings suggest that interfering with MIF-CD74 immunosuppressive signaling in MOs and DCs, using peptide-based  can restore the antitumor immune response in metastatic melanoma. Our study provides the rationale for further development of peptide-based therapies to restore the antitumor immune response in metastatic melanoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537736>Dental Follicle Stem Cells Ameliorate Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation by Secreting TGF-β3 and TSP-1 to Elicit Macrophage  Polarization.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence has demonstrated the novel roles of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in . However, difficulty in acquiring these cells and possible ethical issues limited their application. Recently, we have isolated a unique MSC population from dental follicles with potent stem cell-like properties. This study focused on the effects of dental follicle stem cells (DFSCs) on macrophage activation and polarization to determine their role in immunomodulation and to test if DFSCs are a promising cell source for MSC-based .Rat acute lung injury (ALI) models induced by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were applied to test the immune-modulatory effects of DFSC/DFSC-CM in vivo. The pulmonary permeability was determined by the dry / wet weight ratios of the left upper lung lobe. The lung histopathological damage was graded on a 0 to 4+ scale. And the inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were tested by ELISA. Then we established LPS-induced inflamed macrophage models in vitro. Inflammatory cytokine production and polarization marker expression were measured by RT-qPCR, ELISA, western blot and flow cytometric analysis in macrophages following DFSC-CM treatment. The paracrine factors in DFSC-CM were revealed by a RayBiotech Protein Array. Thereafter, neutralization studies were performed to confirm the potential immune regulators in DFSC-CM.The DFSC/DFSC-CM not only attenuated histopathological damage and pulmonary permeability, but also downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP-1, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in BALF. Immunofluorescence staining revealed the increased expression of macrophage  marker Arg-1. Further in vitro study revealed that macrophages switched to an anti-inflammatory  phenotype when co-cultured with DFSC-CM, characterized by suppressed production of pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP-1, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and M1-polarizing markers iNOS and CD86; and increased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the -polarizing markers Arg-1 and CD163. A RayBiotech Protein Array revealed 42 differentially expressed (> 2-fold) paracrine factors in DFSC-CM compared with the serum-free Ham's F-12K medium, among which TGF-β3 and Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) were upregulated by 18- and 105-fold, respectively. Neutralization studies confirmed the immunoregulatory roles of TGF-β3 and TSP-1 in macrophage activation and polarization.These results indicated that DFSCs can reprogram macrophages into the anti-inflammatory  phenotype, the paracrine factors TGF-β3 and TSP-1 may be one of the underlying mechanisms.

Adaptive and innate immune cells are present in the tumor microenvironment, indicating GIST as inflamed tumors. In addition, murine models suggested a potential interaction between immune components and imatinib. In this retrospective study, the GIST immunological profile was investigated through  analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC), exploring the basis for  approaches. Gene expression profiles (GEP) from 31 KIT/PDGFRA-mutant GIST were analyzed to evaluate the tumor microenvironment and  predictive signatures such as the expanded IFN-γ-induced immune signature (EIIS) and the T-cell-inflamed signature (TIS). GEP and IHC supported the presence of immune infiltrate in GIST, with dominance of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and  macrophages showing a remarkable similarity with melanoma microenvironment. The EIIS genes were expressed in most of GIST samples and positively correlated with PD-L1 abundance ( < .0001). Co-expression was also found between PD-L1 and CD8A ( < .0001) or CD8B ( = .0003). Moreover, the median TIS score for GIST was between the 65th and 70th percentile of the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, in the same range of tumors responding to anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus database GIST samples pre- and post-treatment confirmed that imatinib downregulates PD-L1 and IRF1 expression through the inhibition of KIT and PDGFRA, thus contributing to counteract the suppressed adaptive immune response against GIST. The presence of a rich immune infiltrate in GIST along with the presence of TIS and EIIS suggests that GIST may benefit from  along with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233191>Tumor‑infiltrating  macrophages driven by specific genomic alterations are associated with prognosis in bladder cancer.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to explore the mechanism by which the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment influences bladder cancer. CIBERSORT and ssGSEA analyses revealed that  macrophages accounted for the highest proportion from 22 subsets of tumor‑infiltrating immune cells and were enriched in higher histologic grade and higher pathologic stage bladder cancer and 'basal' subtype of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Kaplan‑Meier survival curve analysis indicated that patients with high numbers of infiltrating  macrophages had worse overall and disease‑specific survival rates. RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry results indicated that  macrophages were enriched in MIBC and promoted angiogenesis.  macrophage infiltration was higher in bladder cancer tissues with mutant TP53, RB transcriptional corepressor 1, phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase catalytic subunit α, lysine methyltransferase 2A, lysine demethylase 6A and apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic‑polypeptide‑like, but lower in tissues with mutant fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), E74‑like ETS transcription factor 3, PC4 and SFRS1 interacting protein 1 and transmembrane and coiled‑coil domains 4. In addition,  macrophage infiltration was lower in the tissues with amplified FGFR3, erb‑b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2, BCL2‑like 1, telomerase reverse transcriptase and tyrosine‑3‑monooxygenase/tryptophan‑5‑monooxygenase activation protein ζ, as well as in the tissues with deleted cyclin‑dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, CREB binding protein, AT‑rich interaction domain 1A, fragile histidine triad diadenosine triphosphatase, phosphodiesterase 4D, RAD51 paralog B, nuclear receptor corepressor 1 and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D. Finally, seven micro (mi) RNAs (miR‑214‑5p, miR‑223‑3p, miR‑155‑5p, miR‑199a‑3p, miR‑199b‑3P, miR‑146b‑5p, miR‑142‑5p) which were expressed differentially in at least three mutant genes and were positively correlated with  macrophage infiltration as well as expressed highly in high grade bladder cancer were identified. Overall, the present study concluded that  macrophages are the predominant tumor‑infiltrating immune cell in bladder cancer and differentially expressed miRNAs due to cancer‑specific genomic alterations may be important drivers of  macrophage infiltration.

The primary mechanism of action of paclitaxel is based on microtubule stabilization inducing cell-cycle arrest. Here, we use several tumor models to show that paclitaxel not only induces tumor cell-cycle arrest, but also promotes antitumor immunity. , paclitaxel reprogrammed -polarized macrophages to the M1-like phenotype in a TLR4-dependent manner, similarly to LPS. Paclitaxel also modulated the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) profile in mouse models of breast and melanoma tumors; gene expression analysis showed that paclitaxel altered the -like signature of TAMs toward an M1-like profile. In mice selectively lacking TLR4 on myeloid cells, for example, macrophages (LysM-Cre/TLR4), the antitumor effect of paclitaxel was attenuated. Gene expression analysis of tumor samples from patients with ovarian cancer before and after treatment with paclitaxel detected an enrichment of genes linked to the M1 macrophage activation profile (IFNγ-stimulated macrophages). These findings indicate that paclitaxel skews TAMs toward an immunocompetent profile via TLR4, which might contribute to the antitumor effect of paclitaxel and provide a rationale for new combination regimens comprising paclitaxel and immunotherapies as an anticancer treatment. This study provides new evidence that the antitumor effect of paclitaxel occurs in part via reactivation of the immune response against cancer, guiding tumor-associated macrophages toward the M1-like antitumor phenotype. http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/20/5891/F1.large.jpg  .©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29733528>Anti-PD-1 therapy redirects macrophages from an  to an M1 phenotype inducing regression of OS lung metastases.</a></h2><p>Osteosarcoma (OS) pulmonary metastasis translates into poor patient survival. The implication of PD-1-PD-L1 pathway in the context of NK cells and/or macrophages in OS is unknown. We investigated the effect of anti-PD-1 in OS lung metastasis and the role of NK cells and/or macrophages in anti-PD-1 responses. A human LM7 OS mouse model was used. Immunohistochemistry for tissues (PD-L1, caspase-3, Ki-67, NK cells, macrophages), and Western blotting for OS lung tumors (p-Stat3, p-Erk1/2) was performed. NK and macrophages were assessed using flow cytometry. NK cell and macrophage depletion were conducted using anti-asialo GM1 and clodrosome, respectively. PD-L1 expression was observed in human OS cells and OS patient lung metastases. Anti-PD1 antibody led to a significant decrease in the number of OS lung metastases, enhanced tumor apoptosis, decreased tumor cell proliferation, and p-STAT-3/p-Erk1/2 signaling blockade in OS lung tumors. NK cells and macrophages in OS lung tumors expressed PD-1 and anti-PD1 increased NK cell and macrophage tumor infiltration. Increased numbers of antitumor M1 macrophages and decreased pro-inflammatory  macrophages were seen. NK depletion did not affect therapeutic effect of anti-PD-1, suggesting that NK cells were not directly involved. However, macrophage depletion significantly compromised anti-PD1 efficacy, confirming their role in efficacy of anti-PD-1 against OS lung metastasis. Our findings suggest that OS lung metastases regression by anti-PD1 can be attributed to activated tumor M1 macrophages and reduced  macrophages. Owing to the co-relation of M1 macrophages with OS patient outcome, we provide a novel mechanism of PD-1 blockade and a basis for future clinical trials for anti-PD-1 antibodies in OS.© 2018 The Authors.

Here we show that exosomes secreted by PDAC cell lines differed in their surface proteins, lipid composition, and efficiency of fusing with THP-1-derived macrophages in vitro. Exosomes from AsPC-1, an ascites-derived human PDAC cell line, were enriched in ICAM-1, which mediated their docking to macrophages through interactions with surface-exposed CD11c on macrophages. AsPC-1 exosomes also contained much higher levels of arachidonic acid (AA), and they fused at a higher rate with THP-1-derived macrophages than did exosomes from other PDAC cell lines or from an immortalized normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line (HPDE) H6c7. Phospholipase A2 enzymatic cleavage of arachidonic acid from AsPC-1 exosomes reduced fusion efficiency. PGE2 secretion was elevated in macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes but not in macrophages treated with exosomes from other cell lines, suggesting a functional role for the AsPC-1 exosome-delivered arachidonic acid in macrophages. Non-polarized (M0) macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes had increased levels of surface markers indicative of polarization to an immunosuppressive -like phenotype (CD14hi CD163hi CD206hi). Furthermore, macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes had significantly increased secretion of pro-tumoral, bioactive molecules including VEGF, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-1β, MMP-9, and TNFα. Together, these results demonstrate that compared to exosomes from other primary tumor-derived PDAC cell lines, AsPC-1 exosomes alter THP-1-derived macrophage phenotype and function. AsPC-1 exosomes mediate communication between tumor cells and TAMs that contributes to tumor progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29503112>Immunogenicity and safety of one or two doses of the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine MenACWY-TT given alone or with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in toddlers: A phase III, open-label, randomised study.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of 1 and 2 doses of quadrivalent meningococcal serogroup A, C, W and Y tetanus toxoid-conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) given alone or co-administered with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in toddlers.In this phase III, open-label, controlled, multicentre study (), healthy toddlers aged 12-14 months were randomised into 4 groups to receive 1 dose of MenACWY-TT at month (M) 0 (ACWY_1), 2 doses of MenACWY-TT at M0 and  (ACWY_2), MenACWY-TT and PCV13 at M0 (Co-ad), or PCV13 at M0 and MenACWY-TT at  (PCV13/ACWY). Immune responses were assessed 1 month post-each vaccination. Solicited and unsolicited symptoms were recorded for 4 and 31 days post-each vaccination, respectively; serious adverse events (SAEs) and new onset of chronic illnesses (NOCIs) up to M9 from first vaccination.802 toddlers were vaccinated. Post-dose 1 of MenACWY-TT, ≥92.8% of toddlers had rSBA titres ≥1:8, and ≥62.5% had hSBA titres ≥1:4 for each meningococcal serogroup. Post-dose 2 of MenACWY-TT, rSBA titres ≥1:8 were observed in ≥98.0% and hSBA titres ≥1:4 in ≥95.3% of toddlers. Percentages of toddlers with hSBA titres ≥1:4 were higher after 2 doses versus 1 dose of MenACWY-TT for MenW (97.1% versus 62.5-68.9%) and MenY (95.3% versus 64.3-67.6%). Non-inferiority of immune responses to co-administered MenACWY-TT and PCV13 over their separate administration was demonstrated. AEs incidence was comparable among groups. SAEs were reported for 4.9%, 5.1%, 5.5% and 7.5%, and NOCIs for 2.0%, 3.0%, 0.5% and 3.5% of toddlers in the ACWY_1, ACWY_2, Co-ad and PCV13/ACWY groups, respectively; 4 SAEs reported in 3 toddlers were vaccine-related. Two fatal vaccine-unrelated SAEs were reported.MenACWY-TT was immunogenic when administered as a single dose at 12-14 months of age. A second dose in toddlers increased hSBA responses against MenW and MenY. MenACWY-TT and PCV13 can be co-administered without impairing the immunogenicity or safety profile of either vaccine.Copyright © 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

The existence of suppressive cells referred to as tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is a major obstacle in prostate cancer . TAMs contribute to the immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes tumor growth and metastasis. In fact, they are main regulators of the complicated interactions between tumor and surrounding microenvironment.  macrophages, as a type of TAMs, are involved in the growth and progression of prostate cancer. Recently, they have gained remarkable importance as therapeutic candidates for solid tumors. In this review, we will discuss the roles of  macrophages and worth of their potential targeting in prostate cancer treatment. In the following, we will introduce important factors resulting in  macrophage promotion and also experimental therapeutic agents that may cause the inhibition of prostate cancer tumor growth.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30861269>Immune infiltration in renal cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Immune infiltration of tumors is closely associated with clinical outcome in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) regulate cancer progression and are appealing therapeutic targets. The purpose of this study was to determine the composition of TIICs in RCC and further reveal the independent prognostic values of TIICs. CIBERSORT, an established algorithm, was applied to estimate the proportions of 22 immune cell types based on gene expression profiles of 891 tumors. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association of TIICs and immune checkpoint modulators with overall survival (OS). We found that CD8+ T cells were associated with prolonged OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI].01-.53; P = 0.03) in chromophobe carcinoma (KICH). A higher proportion of regulatory T cells was associated with a worse outcome (HR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.23-.06; P < 0.01) in renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). In renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), M1 macrophages were associated with a favorable outcome (HR = .43, 95% CI .25-.72; P < 0.01), while  macrophages indicated a worse outcome (HR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.45-4.47; P < 0.01). Moreover, the immunomodulator molecules CTLA4 and LAG3 were associated with a poor prognosis in KIRC, and IDO1 and PD-L2 were associated with a poor prognosis in KIRP. This study indicates TIICs are important determinants of prognosis in RCC meanwhile reveals potential targets and biomarkers for  development.© 2019 The Authors.

We assessed the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the anti-programmed cell death 1 fusion protein AMP-224 in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide and stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) treatment in patients with mCRC refractory to standard chemotherapy.Fifteen patients were enrolled. Six received SBRT 8 Gy on day 0 (dose level 1), whereas 9 received 8 Gy on days -2 to day 0. All received cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m intravenously (I.V.) on day 0. On day 1, both groups received AMP-224 10 mg/kg I.V., repeated every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses. Primary end points were feasibility and safety.Ten (67%) patients completed 6 doses of AMP-224; 5 patients (33%) discontinued treatment because of disease progression. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed; 9 patients (60%) experienced treatment-related adverse events, all Grade 1 or 2. No objective response was noted; 3 patients (20%) had stable disease. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.8 months) and 6.0 months (95% CI, 2.8-9.6 months), respectively.  macrophage polarization was present in the pretreatment tumor biopsy samples, but not post-treatment samples.AMP-224 in combination with SBRT and low-dose cyclophosphamide was well tolerated, however, no significant clinical benefit was observed in patients with mCRC.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Mice with Treg cell-restricted Neuropilin-1 deficiency show tumor resistance while maintaining peripheral immune homeostasis, thereby providing a controlled system to interrogate the impact of intratumoral Treg cells on the TME. Using this and other genetic models, we showed that Treg cells shaped the transcriptional landscape across multiple tumor-infiltrating immune cell types. Treg cells suppressed CD8 T cell secretion of interferon-γ (IFNγ), which would otherwise block the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-mediated fatty acid synthesis in immunosuppressive (-like) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Thus, Treg cells indirectly but selectively sustained -like TAM metabolic fitness, mitochondrial integrity, and survival. SREBP1 inhibition augmented the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade, suggesting that targeting Treg cells or their modulation of lipid metabolism in -like TAMs could improve cancer .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the regulation of inflammation by M1 macrophages and their timely polarization toward regenerative  macrophages suggest an . Particularly, controlling cellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause M1 differentiation, and developing  macrophage phenotypes in macrophages propose a therapeutic approach. Previously, stem or dendritic cells were used in MI for their anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective potentials and showed inflammation modulation and  macrophage progression for cardiac repair. However, cell-based therapeutics are limited due to invasive cell isolation, time-consuming cell expansion, labor-intensive and costly ex vivo cell manipulation, and low grafting efficiency. Here, we report that graphene oxide (GO) can serve as an antioxidant and attenuate inflammation and inflammatory polarization of macrophages via reduction in intracellular ROS. In addition, GO functions as a carrier for interleukin-4 plasmid DNA (IL-4 pDNA) that propagates  macrophages. We synthesized a macrophage-targeting/polarizing GO complex (MGC) and demonstrated that MGC decreased ROS in immune-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, DNA-functionalized MGC (MGC/IL-4 pDNA) polarized M1 to  macrophages and enhanced the secretion of cardiac repair-favorable cytokines. Accordingly, injection of MGC/IL-4 pDNA into mouse MI models attenuated inflammation, elicited early polarization toward  macrophages, mitigated fibrosis, and improved heart function. Taken together, the present study highlights a biological application of GO in timely modulation of the immune environment in MI for cardiac repair. Current therapy using off-the-shelf material GO may overcome the shortcomings of cell therapies for MI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608101>The Construction and Comprehensive Analysis of ceRNA Networks and Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells in Bone Metastatic Melanoma.</a></h2><p> As a malignant and melanocytic tumor, cutaneous melanoma is the devastating skin tumor with high rates of recurrence and metastasis. Bone is the common metastatic location, and bone metastasis may result in pathologic fracture, neurologic damage, and severe bone pain. Although metastatic melanoma was reported to get benefits from , molecular mechanisms and immune microenviroment underlying the melanoma bone metastasis and prognostic factors are still unknown.  Gene expression profiling of 112 samples, including 104 primary melanomas and 8 bone metastatic melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, was assayed to construct a ceRNA network associated with bone metastases. Besides, we detected the fraction of 22 immune cell types in melanoma  the algorithm of "cell type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT)." Based on the significant ceRNAs or immune cells, we constructed nomograms to predict the prognosis of patients with melanoma. Ultimately, correlation analysis was implemented to discover the relationship between the significant ceRNA and immune cells to reveal the potential signaling pathways.  We constructed a ceRNA network based on the interaction among 8 pairs of long noncoding RNA-microRNA and 15 pairs of microRNA-mRNA. CIBERSORT and ceRNA integration analysis discovered that AL118506.1 has both significant prognostic value ( = 0.002) and high correlation with T follicular helper cells ( = 0.033). Meanwhile, T cells CD8 and macrophages  were negatively correlated ( < 0.001). Moreover, we constructed two satisfactory nomograms (area under curve of 3-year survival: 0.899; 5-year survival: 0.885; and concordance index: 0.780) with significant ceRNAs or immune cells, to predict the prognosis of patients.  In this study, we suggest that bone metastasis in melanoma might be related to AL118506.1 and its role in regulating thrombospondin 2 and T follicular helper cells. Two nomograms were constructed to predict the prognosis of patients with melanoma and demonstrated their value in improving the personalized management.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Zeng, Li, Song, Yan, Yin, Hu, Zhu, Chang, Zhang, Zhang, Meng and Huang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30123221>Synergistic Antimyeloma Activity of Dendritic Cells and Pomalidomide in a Murine Myeloma Model.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that immunization with tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) and the immunomodulating drug, lenalidomide, synergistically potentiates the enhancing antitumor immunity in a myeloma mouse model. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity of DCs combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in a myeloma mouse model. MOPC-315 cells were injected subcutaneously to establish myeloma-bearing mice. Four test groups were used to mimic clinical protocol: (1) PBS control, (2) DCs, (3) pomalidomide + dexamethasone, and (4) DCs + pomalidomide + dexamethasone. The combination of DCs plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone displayed greater inhibition of tumor growth compared to the other groups. This effect was closely related with reduced numbers of immune suppressor cells including myeloid-derived suppressor cells,  macrophages, and regulatory T cells, with the induction of immune effector cells such as CD4 and CD8 T cells, memory T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and M1 macrophages, and with the activation of T lymphocytes and NK cells in the spleen. Moreover, the level of the immunosuppressive factor vascular endothelial growth factor was significantly reduced in the tumor microenvironment. The collective findings in the murine myeloma model suggest that tumor antigen-loaded DCs combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone synergistically enhance antitumor immunity by skewing the immune-suppressive status toward an immune-supportive status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953351>C1q/TNF-related protein-9 promotes macrophage polarization and improves cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infarction.</a></h2><p>The timely regulation of inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization toward regenerative  macrophages suggests the possibility of  after myocardial infarction (MI). C1q/TNF-related protein-9 (CTRP9) has anti-inflammatory effects and can ameliorate heart function in mice after long-term myocardial infarction. The role of CTRP9 in macrophage polarization remains completely unclear. This study determined whether CTRP9 can preserve post-MI early cardiac function through the regulation of macrophage polarization. In the present study, an adenovirus-delivered CTRP9 supplement promoted macrophage polarization at Day 3 post MI and improved cardiac function at Day 7 post MI. Pretreatment with gCTRP9 promoted the M1 to  polarization transition and attenuated inflammation after lipopolysaccharide + interferon-γ stimulation; the effects were partly abrogated by the adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C and were obviously reinforced by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor. Meanwhile, CTPR9 markedly reduced the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation by promoting AMPK phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the competitive binding of gCTRP9 and LPS to the myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2)/TLR4 complex was associated with direct binding to MD2, thereby inhibiting the downstream signaling molecule MyD88. Taken together, we demonstrated that CTRP9 improved post-MI early cardiac function, at least in part, by modulating M1/ macrophage polarization, largely via the TLR4/MD2/MyD88 and AMPK-NF-κB pathways.© 2019 The Authors.

Regulation of these cell types is a primary goal for achieving efficient cancer . We found that metformin (Met) induces CD11b+-cell-mediated growth inhibition of a K7M2neo osteosarcoma independent of T cells, as growth inhibition of K7M2neo was still observed in wild-type (WT) mice depleted of T cells by antibodies and in SCID; this contrasted with the effect of Met on Meth A fibrosarcoma, which was entirely T-cell-dependent. Moreover, the inhibitory effect seen in SCID was abrogated by anti-CD11b antibody injection. PMN-MDSCs were significantly reduced in both spleens and tumors following Met treatment. In TAMs, production of IL-12 and TNF-α, but not IL-10, became apparent, and elevation of MHC class II with reduction of CD206 was observed, indicating a shift from an - to M1-like phenotype via Met administration. Metabolically, Met treatment decreased basal respiration and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR)/extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) ratio of CD11b+ cells in tumors, but not in the spleen. In addition, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and proton leakage in MDSCs and TAMs were consistently observed in tumors. Uptake of both 2-deoxy-2-d-glucose (2-NBDG) and BODIPY® decreased in MDSCs, but only BODIPY® incorporation was decreased in TAMs. Overall, our results suggest that Met redirects the metabolism of CD11b+ cells to lower oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) while elevating glycolysis, thereby pushing the microenvironment to a state that inhibits the growth of certain tumors.© The Author(s) 2018.

Hemorrhaging, clotting, and associated inflammation regulate early wound healing. We investigated treatment with a virus-derived immune modulating serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN), Serp-1, which inhibits thrombolytic proteases and inflammation, in a mouse excisional wound model. Saline or recombinant Serp-1 were applied directly to wounds as single doses of 1 μg or 2 µg or as two 1 µg boluses. A chitosan-collagen hydrogel was also tested for Serp-1 delivery. Wound size was measured daily for 15 days and scarring assessed by Masson's trichrome, Herovici's staining, and immune cell dynamics and angiogenesis by immunohistochemistry. Serp-1 treatment significantly accelerated wound healing, but was blocked by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR) antibody. Repeated dosing at a lower concentration was more effective than single high-dose serpin. A single application of Serp-1-loaded chitosan-collagen hydrogel was as effective as repeated aqueous Serp-1 dosing. Serp-1 treatment of wounds increased arginase-1-expressing -polarized macrophage counts and periwound angiogenesis in the wound bed. Collagen staining also demonstrated that Serp-1 improves collagen maturation and organization at the wound site. Serp-1 has potential as a safe and effective immune modulating treatment that targets thrombolytic proteases, accelerating healing and reducing scar in deep cutaneous wounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29871859>TACI-Deficient Macrophages Protect Mice Against Metaflammation and Obesity-Induced Dysregulation of Glucose Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) is a receptor for the TNF superfamily cytokines, B cell-activating factor (BAFF), and A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). Here, we demonstrate that TACI-deficient mice subjected to high-fat diet (HFD) are protected from weight gain and dysregulated glucose homeostasis. Resistance to HFD-induced metabolic changes in TACI-deficient mice does not involve TACI-mediated adipogenesis. Instead, accumulation of  macrophages (Mϕs), eosinophils, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is implicated in the protection from obesity-induced assaults. In support of this hypothesis, adoptively transferred TACI-deficient peritoneal or adipose tissue Mϕs, but not B cells, can improve glucose metabolism in the obese host. Interestingly, the transferred TACI-deficient Mϕs not only home to host VAT but also trigger the accumulation of host  Mϕs and eosinophils in VAT. The increase in host  Mϕs in VAT is likely a result of eosinophil recruitment in response to eotaxin-2 produced by TACI-deficient Mϕs. Insulin signaling experiments revealed that IL-10 secreted by TACI-deficient Mϕs is responsible for maintaining adipocyte insulin sensitivity. Thus, the adoptive transfer experiments offer a model where TACI-deficient Mϕs accumulate in VAT and protect against metaflammation and obesity-associated dysregulation of glucose metabolism.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31038851>Immune microenvironments differ in immune characteristics and outcome of glioblastoma multiforme.</a></h2><p>Understanding the interactions between tumors and the host immune system holds great promise to uncover biomarkers for targeted therapies, predict the prognosis of patients and guide clinical treatment. However, the immune signatures of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remain largely unstudied in terms of systematic analyses. We aimed to classify GBM samples according to immune-related genes and complement the existing  system knowledge. In this study, we designed a strategy to identify 3 immune subtypes representing 3 different immune microenvironments (M1-M3) and associated with prognosis. The 3 subtypes were significantly different in terms of specific immune characteristics (immune cell subpopulations, immune responses, immune cells, and checkpoint gene interactions). In additional, copy number variations and methylation changes were identified that correlated with genes related to a worse prognosis subtype in the microenvironment. More importantly, in M3 (worst prognosis subtype) and  (best prognosis subtype), the interaction between immune cells and checkpoint genes was different, which had an important effect on the prognosis. Finally, we used risk scores of immune cells and checkpoint genes to evaluate the prognosis of GBM patients and validated the results with 3 independent datasets. Disordered interactions between immune cells and checkpoint genes result in a change in the immune microenvironment and affects the prognosis of patients.

For targeted siRNA delivery, however, safe and stable carriers are required that manage cell specific transport to  macrophages. Here, siRNA-loaded cationic nanogels are reported with α-mannosyl decorated surfaces that target and modify  macrophages selectively. Via amphiphilic precursor block copolymers bearing one single α-mannosyl moiety at their chain end mannosylated cationic nanohydrogel particles (ManNP) were obtained of 20 nm diameter determined by dynamic light scattering and cryogenic electron transmission microscopy. α-Mannosyl surface modification is confirmed by agglutination with concanavalin A. SiRNA-loaded ManNP preferentially targets the overexpressed mannose receptor CD206 on  macrophages, as shown by in vitro cell uptake studies in  polarized primary macrophages. This specificity is confirmed, since ManNP uptake could be reduced by blocking of CD206 with mannan. Effective ManNP-guided siRNA delivery is confirmed by sequence-specific gene knockdown of CSF-1R in -type macrophages exclusively, while the expression levels in M1-polarized macrophages is not affected. In conclusion, α-mannosyl-functionalized ManNPs are promising universal siRNA carriers for targeted immunomodulatory treatment of immunosuppressive macrophages.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and mannose doubly modified trimethyl chitosan (PEG = MT) along with citraconic anhydride grafted poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PC)-based nanoparticles (NPs) (PEG = MT/PC NPs) with dual pH-responsiveness were developed to deliver VEGF siRNA (siVEGF)/PIGF siRNA (siPIGF) to both -TAMs and breast cancer cells for antitumor . With prolonged blood circulation and intelligent pH-sensitivity, PEG = MT/PC NPs were highly accumulated in tumor tissues and then internalized in -TAMs and breast cancer cells via mannose-mediated active targeting and passive targeting, respectively. With the charge-reversal of PC, PEG = MT/PC NPs presented effective endosomal/lysosomal escape and intracellular siRNA release, resulting in efficient gene silencing. Due to the synergism between siVEGF and siPIGF in anti-proliferation of tumor cells and reversal of the TME from pro-oncogenic to anti-tumoral, PEG = MT/PC/siVEGF/siPIGF NPs (PEG = MT/PC/siV-P NPs) exerted robust suppression of breast tumor growth and lung metastasis.

Advancement in modern medicine and establishment of separate branches of medical science dealing with sepsis research have improved its outcome. However, mortality associated with sepsis still remains higher (25-30%) that further increases to 40-50% in the presence of septic shock. For example, sepsis-associated deaths account more in comparison to deaths-associated with myocardial-infarction and certain cancers (i.e. breast and colorectal cancer). However, it is now well established that profound activation of innate immune cells including macrophages play a very important role in the immunopathogenesis of sepsis. Macrophages are sentinel cells of the innate immune system with their location varying from peripheral blood to various target organs including lungs, liver, brain, kidneys, skin, testes, vascular endothelium etc. Thus, profound and dysregulated activation of these cells during sepsis can directly impact the outcome of sepsis. However, the emergence of the concept of immunometabolism as a major controller of immune response has raised a new hope for identifying new targets for immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches. Thus this present review starts with an introduction of sepsis as a major medical problem worldwide and signifies the role of dysregulated innate immune response including macrophages in its immunopathogenesis. Thereafter, subsequent sections describe changes in immunometabolic stage of macrophages (both M1 and ) during sepsis.

However, the resulting immune response, which may play an important role in either potentiating or blunting the effects of VTP, is still incompletely understood. Myeloid cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and macrophages are often found in tumors and are widely reported to be associated with cancer angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and immunosuppression. These cells are also known to play a critical role in wound-healing, which is induced by rapid tissue destruction. In this study, we investigated the effects of VTP on the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, specifically MDSCs and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in the Myc-Cap and TRAMP C2 murine prostate cancer models. We report that VTP increased the infiltration of myeloid cells into the tumors, as well as their expression of CSF1R, a receptor required for myeloid differentiation, proliferation, and tumor migration. As anti-CSF1R treatment has previously been used to deplete these cells types in other murine models of prostate cancer, we hypothesized that combining anti-CSF1R with VTP therapy would lead to decreased tumor regrowth and improved survival. Importantly, we found that targeting myeloid cells using anti-CSF1R in combination with VTP therapy decreased the number of tumor MDSCs and TAMs, especially  macrophages, as well as increased CD8 T cell infiltration, decreased tumor growth and improved overall survival. These results suggest that targeting myeloid cells via CSF1R targeting is a promising strategy to potentiate the anti-tumor effects of VTP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30038013>Recombinant  promotes tumor rejection by CD8 T cell-dependent remodeling of the tumor microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Agents that remodel the tumor microenvironment (TME), prime functional tumor-specific T cells, and block inhibitory signaling pathways are essential components of effective . We are evaluating live-attenuated, double-deleted  expressing tumor antigens (LADD-Ag) in the clinic. Here we show in numerous mouse models that while treatment with nonrecombinant LADD induced some changes in the TME, no antitumor efficacy was observed, even when combined with immune checkpoint blockade. In contrast, LADD-Ag promoted tumor rejection by priming tumor-specific KLRG1PD1CD62L CD8 T cells. These IFNγ-producing effector CD8 T cells infiltrated the tumor and converted the tumor from an immunosuppressive to an inflamed microenvironment that was characterized by a decrease in regulatory T cells (Treg) levels, a proinflammatory cytokine milieu, and the shift of  macrophages to an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)CD206 M1 phenotype. Remarkably, these LADD-Ag-induced tumor-specific T cells persisted for more than 2 months after primary tumor challenge and rapidly controlled secondary tumor challenge. Our results indicate that the striking antitumor efficacy observed in mice with LADD-based  stems from TME remodeling which is a direct consequence of eliciting potent, systemic tumor-specific CD8 T cells.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

We previously reported that IgE class antibodies promote restriction of cancer growth in rodent models associated with significant TAM infiltration. However, the human macrophage-associated IgE-Fc Receptor (FcεR) axis remains unexplored. We investigated the effects of anti-tumour IgE stimulation on human macrophage activation.Human blood monocyte-differentiated quiescent (M0), classically-(M1) and alternatively-() activated macrophages were crosslinked with IgE and polyclonal antibodies to mimic immune complex formation. We examined surface marker expression, cytokine secretion, protein kinase phosphorylation and gene expression in IgE-stimulated macrophages and IgE antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tumour cells.A proportion (40%) of  and (<20%) M0 and M1 macrophages expressed the high-affinity IgE receptor FcεRI. IgE crosslinking triggered upregulation of co-stimulatory CD80, increased TNFα, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-12, IL-10, IL-13, CXCL9, CXCL11 and RANTES secretion by M0 and  and additionally enhanced MCP-1 by  macrophages. IgE-stimulated M1 macrophages retained secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. IgE crosslinking enhanced the FcεRI-dependent signalling pathway, including phosphorylation of the Lyn kinase, ERK1/2 and p38 in  macrophages and upregulated Lyn gene expression by M1 and  macrophages. Anti-tumour IgE engendered ADCC of cancer cells by all macrophage subsets.IgE can engage and re-educate alternatively-activated macrophages towards pro-inflammatory phenotypes and prime all subsets to mediate anti-tumour functions.

Evaluating the effect of standard chemotherapy on the immune microenvironment may suggest new opportunities for -based approaches to treating HR/HER2 breast tumors.HR/HER2 breast tumors were analyzed before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. sTIL were assessed histologically; CD8 cells, CD68 cells, and PD-L1 staining were assessed immunohistochemically; whole transcriptome sequencing and panel RNA expression analysis (NanoString) were performed.Ninety-six patients were analyzed from two cohorts ( = 55, Dana-Farber cohort;  = 41, MD Anderson cohort). sTIL, CD8, and PD-L1 on tumor cells were higher in tumors with basal PAM50 intrinsic subtype. Higher levels of tissue-based lymphocyte (sTIL, CD8, PD-L1) and macrophage (CD68) markers, as well as gene expression markers of lymphocyte or macrophage phenotypes (NanoString or CIBERSORT), correlated with favorable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but not with improved distant metastasis-free survival in these cohorts or a large gene expression dataset ( = 302). In paired pre-/postchemotherapy samples, sTIL and CD8 cells were significantly decreased after treatment, whereas expression analyses (NanoString) demonstrated significant increase of multiple myeloid signatures. Single gene expression implicated increased expression of immunosuppressive (-like) macrophage-specific genes after chemotherapy.The immune microenvironment of HR/HER2 tumors differs according to tumor biology.

However, in spite of the general association between a high effector T cell density and improved outcome, our recent work has revealed a specific lymphocyte-driven cancer cell-supporting signal. Indeed, lymphocyte-derived CCL5 supports CCR5-positive tumor cell proliferation and thereby fosters tumor growth in metastatic liver lesions. Upon systematic analysis of CCR5 expression by tumor cells using immunohistochemistry, we observed that the intensity of CCR5 increases with primary tumor size and peaks in T4 tumors. In liver metastases however, though CCR5 expression intensity is globally heightened compared to primary tumors, alterations in the expression patterns appear, leading to "patchiness" of the stain. CCR5 patchiness is, therefore, a signature of liver metastases in our cohort ( = 97 specimens) and relates to globally decreased expression intensity, but does not influence the extent of the response to CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc in patients. Moreover, CCR5 patchiness relates to a poor immune landscape characterized by a low cytotoxic-to-regulatory T cell ratio at the invasive margin and enriched cellular and molecular markers of macrophage  polarization. Finally, because higher numbers of PD-1- and CTLA-4-positive cells surround tumors with patchy CCR5 expression, one can speculate that these tumors potentially respond to immune checkpoint blockade. This hypothesis is corroborated by the prolonged disease-free survival and disease-specific survival observed in patients with low gene expression of CCR5 in metastases from two publically available cohorts. These observations highlight the complex role of the CCL5-CCR5 axis in CRC metastatic progression and warrant further investigations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30149762>Effects of CSF1R-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-modified NK92MI & T cells on tumor-associated macrophages.</a></h2><p>Tumor  has shown great progress for the treatment of cancer; however, both endogenous and exogenous T cells are inhibited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the microenvironment play pivotal and complex roles in tumor development and progression. Macrophages are categorized as M1 and  types. Relevant studies suggest that  TAMs correlate with poor prognosis. Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) controls the formation, differentiation and function of  macrophages, which helps tumors grow, metastasize and secrete immunosuppressive cytokines. The objectives of this study were to establish two types of third-generation chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that could specifically target human CSF1R, and to introduce the CARs into NK92MI cells and normal human peripheral blood T cells through lentiviral transduction to produce CAR-natural killer (NK) and -T cells. We then tested their cytotoxicity against cell lines and peripheral blood monocytes expressing CSF1R. In vitro experiments confirmed that third-generation CARs had good target specificity and cytotoxicity. It was expected that CAR-NK and -T cells could specifically kill  TAMs in the tumor microenvironment and remove their inhibitory effect. Therefore, CSF1R-targeting CAR-NK and -T cells could represent a novel cellular  strategy in conjunction with other antibody-based drugs and targeted therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582532>Dual inhibition of angiopoietin-TIE2 and MET alters the tumor microenvironment and prolongs survival in a metastatic model of renal cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown clinical benefit in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) but novel therapeutic strategies are needed. The angiopoietin/Tie2 and MET pathways have been implicated in tumor angiogenesis, metastases, and macrophage infiltration. In our study, we used trebananib, an angiopoietin 1/2 inhibitor and a novel small molecule MET kinase inhibitor in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of ccRCC. Our goal was to assess the ability of these compounds to alter the status of tumor infiltrating macrophages, inhibit tumor growth and metastases, and prolong survival. Seven-week-old SCID mice were implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically with human ccRCC models. One month post implantation, mice were treated with angiopoietin 1/2 inhibitor trebananib (AMG 386), MET kinase inhibitor or combination. In our metastatic ccRCC PDX model, RP-R-02LM, trebananib alone and in combination with a MET kinase inhibitor significantly reduced lung metastases and  macrophage infiltration (p=0.0075 and p=0.0205 respectively). Survival studies revealed that treatment of the orthotopically implanted RP-R-02LM tumors yielded a significant increase in survival in both trebananib and combination groups. Additionally, resection of the subcutaneously implanted primary tumor allowed for a significant survival advantage to the combination group compared to vehicle and both single agent groups. Our results show that the combination of trebananib with a MET kinase inhibitor significantly inhibits the spread of metastases, reduces infiltrating  type macrophages, and prolongs survival in our highly metastatic ccRCC PDX model, suggesting a potential use for this combination therapy in treating patients with ccRCC.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29436395>Myeloid-targeted immunotherapies act in synergy to induce inflammation and antitumor immunity.</a></h2><p>Eliciting effective antitumor immune responses in patients who fail checkpoint inhibitor therapy is a critical challenge in cancer , and in such patients, tumor-associated myeloid cells and macrophages (TAMs) are promising therapeutic targets. We demonstrate in an autochthonous, poorly immunogenic mouse model of melanoma that combination therapy with an agonistic anti-CD40 mAb and CSF-1R inhibitor potently suppressed tumor growth. Microwell assays to measure multiplex protein secretion by single cells identified that untreated tumors have distinct TAM subpopulations secreting MMP9 or cosecreting CCL17/22, characteristic of an -like state. Combination therapy reduced the frequency of these subsets, while simultaneously inducing a separate polyfunctional inflammatory TAM subset cosecreting TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12. Tumor suppression by this combined therapy was partially dependent on T cells, and on TNF-α and IFN-γ.

However, what drives  polarization of TAMs and how TAMs suppress antitumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain largely undefined. Using several murine tumor models, we showed that hedgehog (Hh) signaling in myeloid cells is critical for TAM  polarization and tumor growth. We also found that tumor cells secrete sonic hedgehog (SHH), an Hh ligand, and that tumor-derived SHH drives TAM  polarization. Furthermore, Hh-induced functional polarization in TAMs suppresses CD8+ T cell recruitment to the TME through the inhibition of CXCL9 and CXCL10 production by TAMs. Last, we demonstrated that Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) mediates Hh-dependent TAM  polarization and the immunosuppressive function.

Recent research has demonstrated that metabolic reprogramming in a tumor can contribute towards immune tolerance. To begin to understand the interface between metabolic remodeling and the immune-suppressive state in GBM, we performed a focused, integrative analysis coupling metabolomics with gene-expression profiling in patient-derived GBM (n = 80) and compared them to low-grade astrocytoma (LGA; n = 28). Metabolic intermediates of tryptophan, arginine, prostaglandin, and adenosine emerged as immuno-metabolic nodes in GBM specific to the mesenchymal and classical molecular subtypes of GBM. Integrative analyses emphasized the importance of downstream metabolism of several of these metabolic pathways in GBM. Using CIBERSORT to analyze immune components from the transcriptional profiles of individual tumors, we demonstrated that tryptophan and adenosine metabolism resulted in an accumulation of Tregs and  macrophages, respectively, and was recapitulated in mouse models. Furthermore, we extended these findings to preclinical models to determine their potential utility in defining the biologic and/or immunologic consequences of the identified metabolic programs.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the inflammatory cells that greatly influence cancer. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophages can either stimulate or inhibit tumorigenesis. TAMs that stimulate tumor cell proliferation (-phenotype) enrich the TME with growth factors and immunosuppressive molecules, whereas tumor inhibitory TAMs (M1-phenotype) initiate the immune response to dampen tumor progression. Shifting between phenotypes is controlled by several components of the TME. Targeting macrophages, specifically inhibiting  TAMs, has been introduced successfully in cancer . However, signaling mechanisms underlining TAM polarization are largely unknown. This review analyzed studies of the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as a determinant of macrophage polarization. It is proposed that activation of MAPK, particularly extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38, might favor the differentiation into  TAMs. Thus, pharmacological modification of MAPK pathways will potentially offer exciting new targets in cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30917918>Induction of breast cancer stem cells by M1 macrophages through Lin-28B-let-7-HMGA2 axis.</a></h2><p>Proinflammatory macrophage (M1) is now being suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer because of its tumoricidal capacity.

Here, we found that M1 induced a subpopulation of CD44/CD24 or ALDH1 cells with CSC-like phenotypes from different types of breast cancer cells (BCCs) in a paracrine manner. Stat3/NF-κB pathways in BCCs were activated by proinflammatory cytokines, igniting Lin-28B-let-7-HMGA2 axis to induce CSC through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Previously, we reported that Stat3-coordinated Lin-28B-let-7-HMGA2 axis initiated EMT in BCCs. Here, inhibition of Stat3/NF-κB pathways or Lin-28B-let-7-HMGA2 axis suppressed EMT/CSCs program. Notably, HMGA2 knockdown directly repressed M1-induced CSC formation and expression of Klf-4 and Nanog. Meanwhile, prolonged coculture with BCCs endowed M1 with  properties. M1 supernatant induced CSC from non-stem cancer cells, while  supernatant sustained a higher proportion of ALDH1 cells.

Previous work identified GARP on Treg, and also GARP on the surface of several malignant tumors, as well as in a soluble form being shedded from their surface, contributing to tumor immune escape. Preliminary results also showed GARP expression on brain metastases of malignant melanoma. On the basis of these findings, we investigated whether GARP is also expressed on primary brain tumors. We showed GARP expression on glioblastoma (GB) cell lines and primary GB tissue, as well as on low-grade glioma, suggesting an important influence on the tumor micromilieu and the regulation of immune responses also in primary cerebral tumors. This was supported by the finding that GB cells led to a reduced, in part GARP-dependent effector T cell function (reduced proliferation and reduced cytokine secretion) in coculture experiments. Interestingly, GARP was localized not only on the cell surface but also in the cytoplasmatic, as well as nuclear compartments in tumor cells. Our findings reveal that GARP, as an immunoregulatory molecule, is located on, as well as in, tumor cells of GB and low-grade glioma, inhibiting effector T cell function, and thus contributing to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of primary brain tumors.

Mathematical models suggest that vaccines that reduce viral transmission from infected individuals could substantially reduce viral spread in an epidemic or pandemic, even if they do not completely protect against infection. Vaccines targeting conserved nucleoprotein (A/NP) and matrix 2 () antigens of influenza virus do not completely prevent infection upon influenza virus challenge, but reduce viral replication, morbidity, and mortality. Using a mouse model of influenza virus transmission, we have previously shown that immunization with recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing the combination of A/NP and  can reduce viral transmission to unimmunized contacts. Here we demonstrate that transmission reduction is more effective when mice are immunized against A/NP and  intranasally than via the intramuscular route. We show that immunization against the combination of A/NP and  is more effective at reducing transmission than either antigen alone, with a clear hierarchy of effectiveness (A/NP +  > A/NP > ). Transmission reduction is seen to a similar degree under both direct-contact and airborne transmission conditions. Finally, using seroconversion as an indicator of infection, we show that immunizing contact mice against A/NP and  prevents a significant fraction (∼50%) from becoming infected under direct-contact conditions.

Gene set enrichment and iPANDA analyses were conducted to dissect differences in signaling pathways, somatic mutations and copy number aberrations for TCIP-H versus TCIP-L tumors, stratified by HPV status.TCIP-H SCCHN tumors were enriched in multiple immune checkpoints irrespective of HPV-status. HPV-positive tumors were enriched in markers of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and HPV-negative tumors in protumorigenic  macrophages. TCIP-L SCCHN tumors were enriched for the β-catenin/WNT and Hedgehog signaling pathways, had frequent mutations in NSD1, amplifications in EGFR and YAP1, as well as CDKN2A deletions. TCIP-H SCCHN tumors were associated with the MAPK/ERK, JAK/STAT and mTOR/AKT signaling pathways, and were enriched in CASP8, EP300, EPHA2, HRAS mutations, CD274, PDCD1LG2, JAK2 amplifications.Our findings support that combinatorial immune checkpoint blockade and depletion strategies targeting Tregs in HPV-positive and  macrophages in HPV-negative tumors may lead to improved antitumor immune responses in patients with TCIP-H SCCHN. We highlight novel pathways and genetic events that may serve as candidate biomarkers and novel targeted therapies to enhance the efficacy of  in SCCHN patients.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Resetting tumor-associated macrophages represents an attractive target for an effective cancer . WCCP-N-b, a novel linear 3-O-methylated galactan, isolated from Cantharellus cibarius, can convert tumor-promoting -like macrophages to tumor-inhibiting M1-like phenotype. On a cellular mechanistic level, WCCP-N-b inhibited -like macrophages polarization through suppression of STAT6 activation. Furthermore, WCCP-N-b increased the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and degradation of IκB-α through targeting Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). The activation of MAPKs and degradation of IκB-α were responsible for converting -like macrophages to M1-like macrophages. Importantly, cell culture supernatants of WCCP-N-b-treated -like macrophages could inhibit the cell viability of B16F1 and B16F10.

Current TAMs repolarization strategies mainly focused on harnessing the direct cancer cell killing property of M1-like macrophages repolarized from TAMs. However, the latent role of M1-like macrophages as professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) also needs to be explored. Here, iron chelated melanin-like nanoparticles (Fe@PDA-PEG) were developed for -to-M1 TAMs repolarization and photothermal therapy (PTT) induced tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) releasing, which would exploit the potential of M1-like macrophages acquired as professional APCs for TAAs presentation. The results showed that M1 macrophages repolarized from TAMs by Fe@PDA-PEG could capture, process and present TAAs released by PTT through the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) pathway, recruiting T-helper cells and effector T cells in tumor site, which leads to the controlled tumor growth and limited malignant metastasis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the highly dynamic properties of macrophages, in recent years the repolarization of TAMs from pro-tumoral  phenotype to anti-tumoral M1 phenotype by various strategies has emerged as a promising cancer  approach for improving cancer therapy. Herein, we present an aromatic secondary amine-functionalized Bodipy dye  and its mitochondria-targetable derivative  as fluorescent NO probes for discriminating M1 macrophages from  macrophages in terms of their difference in inducible NO synthase (iNOS) levels. The two probes possess the unique ability to simultaneously respond to two secondary oxides of NO, , NO and ONOO, thus being more sensitive and reliable for reflecting intracellular NO than most of the existing fluorescent NO probes that usually respond to NO only. With  as a representative, the discrimination between M1 and  macrophages, evaluation of the repolarization of TAMs from pro-tumoral  phenotype to anti-tumoral M1 phenotype, and visualization of NO communication during the immune-mediated phagocytosis of cancer cells by M1 macrophages have been realized.

It has been intensively studied for its role in regulating apoptosis and oncogenic transformation. However, the impact of miR-21 on host anti-tumor immunity remains unknown. Tumor-associated macrophages are a major leukocyte type that infiltrates tumors and predominantly develops into immunosuppressive, tumor-promoting -like macrophages. In contrast, the pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages have tumoricidal activity. In this study, we show that genetic deficiency of miR-21 promotes the polarization of macrophages toward an M1-like phenotype in vivo and in vitro in the presence of tumor cells; thus it confers host mice with enhanced anti-tumor immunity. By downregulating JAK2 and STAT1, miR-21 inhibits the IFN-γ-induced STAT1 signaling pathway, which is required for macrophage M1 polarization. We also show that the expression of miR-21 in macrophages is regulated upon polarization stimuli as well as upon macrophages co-culturing with tumor cells. Thus, tumor cells may stimulate miR-21 expression in tumor-associated macrophages to prevent tumoricidal M1 polarization. However, augmented STAT1 signaling mediated by miR-21 deficiency upregulates PD-L1 expression in macrophages, which is known to inhibit phagocytic anti-tumor activity. This adverse effect can be alleviated by PD-1 blockade; indeed, miR-21 depletion in macrophages and PD-1 antibody treatment offer superior anti-tumor activity than either agent alone. These studies shed lights on potential application of the combination of miR-21 inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade to target the tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796203>Tumor-derived exosomal HMGB1 promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression through inducing PD1 TAM expansion.</a></h2><p>Macrophages constitute one of the most common components of immune cells, which penetrate tumors and they have a key role in tumor prognosis. Here, we identified an unrecognized macrophage subpopulation, which favors tumorigenesis. These macrophages express programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) in a constitutive manner and accumulates in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in advanced stage of the disease and is negatively associated with the survival of ESCC patients. The PD1 tumor-associated macrophages (PD1 TAMs) displayed surface pattern and function akin to : a substantial enhancement in CD206 and IL-10 expression; a specific reduction in HLA-DR, CD64, and IL-12 expression; and a significant increase in the ability to inhibit CD8 T-cell proliferation. Triggering of PD1 signal is effective in increasing PD1 TAM function. Moreover, exosomal HMGB1 obtained from tumors are efficient in triggering differentiation of monocytes into PD1 TAMs, which display phenotypic and functional properties of . Overall, our work is the first finding to confirm that exosomal HMGB1 obtained from ESCC can successfully trigger clonal expansion of PD1 TAM. Further, as the macrophages exhibit an -like surface profile and function, thereby creating conditions for development of ESCC. Thus, effective methods of treatment include combining  with targeting PD1 TAMs and tumor-derived exosomal HMGB1 to resuscitate immune function in individuals suffering from ESCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900055>pH regulators to target the tumor immune microenvironment in human hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Interfering with tumor metabolism is an emerging strategy for treating cancers that are resistant to standard therapies. Featuring a rapid proliferation rate and exacerbated glycolysis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) creates a highly hypoxic microenvironment with excessive production of lactic and carbonic acids. These metabolic conditions promote disease aggressiveness and cancer-related immunosuppression. The pH regulatory molecules work as a bridge between tumor cells and their surrounding milieu. Herein, we show that the pH regulatory molecules CAIX, CAXII and V-ATPase are overexpressed in the HCC microenvironment and that interfering with their pathways exerts antitumor activity. Importantly, the V-ATPase complex was expressed by -like tumor-associated macrophages. Blocking  V-ATPase activity established a less immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment and reversed the mesenchymal features of HCC. Thus, targeting the unique cross-talk between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment played by pH regulatory molecules holds promise as a strategy to control HCC progression and to reduce the immunosuppressive pressure mediated by the hypoxic/acidic metabolism, particularly considering the potential combination of this strategy with emerging immune checkpoint-based immunotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833271>The Immune Subtypes and Landscape of Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>To identify immune subtypes and investigate the immune landscape of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), which share common etiology and histologic features.Based on the immune gene expression profiles of 1,368 patients with SCC in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we used consensus clustering to identify robust clusters of patients and assessed their reproducibility in an independent pan-SCC cohort of 938 patients. We further applied graph structure learning-based dimensionality reduction to the immune profiles to visualize the distribution of individual patients.We identified and independently validated six reproducible immune subtypes associated with distinct molecular characteristics and clinical outcomes. An immune-cold subtype had the least amount of lymphocyte infiltration and a high level of aneuploidy, and these patients had the worst prognosis. By contrast, an immune-hot subtype demonstrated the highest infiltration of CD8 T cells, activated NK cells, and elevated IFNγ response. Accordingly, these patients had the best prognosis. A third subtype was dominated by -polarized macrophages with potent immune-suppressive factors such as TGFβ signaling and reactive stroma, and these patients had relatively inferior prognosis. Other subtypes showed more diverse immunologic features with intermediate prognoses. Finally, our analysis revealed a complex immune landscape consisting of both discrete clusters and continuous spectrum.This study provides a conceptual framework to understand the tumor immune microenvironment of SCCs.

Macrophages also play important roles in regulating iron homeostasis, and intracellular iron accumulation induces M1-type macrophage polarization which provides a potential approach to tumor  through  tumor-associated macrophage repolarization. However, the mechanisms underlying iron-induced M1 polarization remain unclear.Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and flow cytometry were used to detect the polarization indexes in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages treated with iron, and Western bloting and qRT-PCR were used to detect p21 expression. The compound 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate was used to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in macrophages after iron or N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) treatment. The p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) inhibitor C646 was used to inhibit p53 acetylation, and Western bloting, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence were used to detect p53 expression and acetylation. BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with H22 hepatoma cells, and macrophage polarization status was investigated after tail intravenous injection of iron. Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate the protein expression of cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86) and EGF-like module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 1 (F4/80) in the subcutaneous tumors.Iron overload induced M1 polarization by increasing ROS production and inducing p53 acetylation in RAW cells, and reduction in ROS levels by NAC repressed M1 polarization and p53 acetylation. Inhibition of acetyl-p53 by a p300/CBP inhibitor prevented M1 polarization and inhibited p21 expression. These results showed that high ROS levels induced by iron overload polarized macrophages to the M1 subtype by enhancing p300/CBP acetyltransferase activity and promoting p53 acetylation.© 2018 The Authors.

The critical role of inflammation is now challenged by several contradictory observations indicating that the emergence of these chronic disorders may result from non-inflammatory events. A growing number of studies reveals that micro- and nano-particles can cause exaggerated and persistent immunosuppression characterized by the release of potent anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β), and the recruitment of major regulatory immune cells ( macrophages, T and B regs, and MDSC). This persistent immunosuppressive environment is initially established to limit early inflammation but contributes later to fibrosis, cancer, and infection. Immunosuppression promotes fibroblast proliferation and matrix element synthesis and subverts innate and adaptive immune surveillance against tumor cells and microorganisms. This review details the contribution of immunosuppressive cells and their derived immunoregulatory mediators and delineates the mutual role of inflammatory vs. immunosuppressive mechanisms in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases induced by particles. The consideration of these new results explains how particle-related diseases can develop independently of chronic inflammation, enriches current bioassays predicting particle toxicity and suggests new clinical strategies for treating patients affected by particle-associated diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937266>Tumors and Their Microenvironment Dual-Targeting Chemotherapy with Local Immune Adjuvant Therapy for Effective Antitumor Immunity against Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>Chemotherapy turns tumor cells into "tumor vaccines" by immunogenic cell death (ICD). However, it remains a challenge to exploit chemotherapy-induced "tumor vaccines" for solid cancer  due to the inefficient effector T cells activation and tumor microenvironment immunosuppression. Here, a matrix metalloprotease 2 responsive liposome (PEG-FA-Lip) composed of cleavable PEG chains covering the folate (FA)-modified liposome is developed to deliver ICD inducer doxorubicin. In breast cancer-bearing mice, PEG-FA-Lip targets both 4T1 breast cancer cells and -tumor associated macrophages (-TAMs) via FA-receptor mediated endocytosis, resulting in abundant "tumor vaccines" and efficient elimination of -TAMs. The combination of local cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) therapy facilitates PEG-FA-Lip induced "tumor vaccines" to effectively arouse systematic effector T cells immune response through promoting dendritic cell maturation and immunostimulatory cytokines secretion. The simultaneous elimination of -TAMs ensures the activated effector T cells exert antitumor immunity within tumor via decreasing immunosuppressive cytokines secretion and tumor infiltration of Treg cells. After receiving the combined treatment, 30.1% of breast cancer-bearing mice (initial tumor volume > 100 mm) achieves the goal of tumor eradication. Remarkably, this combination therapy greatly inhibits lung metastasis and controls the growth of already metastasized breast cancers (initial tumor volume > 100 mm).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470128>Combination Treatment of the Oral CHK1 Inhibitor, SRA737, and Low-Dose Gemcitabine Enhances the Effect of Programmed Death Ligand 1 Blockade by Modulating the Immune Microenvironment in SCLC.</a></h2><p>Despite the enthusiasm surrounding cancer , most SCLC patients show very modest response to immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy treatment. Therefore, there is growing interest in combining immune checkpoint blockade with chemotherapy and other treatments to enhance immune checkpoint blockade efficacy. Based on favorable clinical trial results, chemotherapy and  combinations have been recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for frontline treatment for SCLC.Here, we show that combined treatment of SRA737, an oral CHK1 inhibitor, and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) leads to an antitumor response in multiple cancer models, including SCLC. We further show that combining low, non-cytotoxic doses of gemcitabine with SRA737 + anti-PD-L1/anti-PD-1 significantly increased antitumorigenic CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, dendritic cells, and M1 macrophage populations in an SCLC model. This regimen also led to a significant decrease in immunosuppressive  macrophage and myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations, as well as an increase in the expression of the type I interferon beta 1 gene, IFNβ, and chemokines, CCL5 and CXCL10.Given that anti-PD-L1/anti-PD-1 drugs have recently been approved as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of SCLC, and that the SRA737 + low dose gemcitabine regimen is currently in clinical trials for SCLC and other malignancies, our preclinical data provide a strong rational for combining this regimen with inhibitors of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway.Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

Autosomal-dominant inheritance of a R94Q mutation in MFN2 causes the axonal subtype 2A2A which is characterized by early onset and progressive atrophy of distal muscles caused by motoneuronal degeneration. Here, we studied mitochondrial shape, respiration, cytosolic, and mitochondrial ATP content as well as mitochondrial quality control in MFN2-deficient fibroblasts stably expressing wildtype or R94Q MFN2. Under normal culture conditions, R94Q cells had slightly more fragmented mitochondria but a similar mitochondrial oxygen consumption, membrane potential, and ATP production as wildtype cells. However, when inducing mild oxidative stress 24 h before analysis using 100 µM hydrogen peroxide, R94Q cells exhibited significantly increased respiration but decreased mitochondrial ATP production. This was accompanied by increased glucose uptake and an up-regulation of hexokinase 1 and pyruvate kinase , suggesting increased pyruvate shuttling into mitochondria. Interestingly, these changes coincided with decreased levels of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in R94Q cells. We conclude that mitochondria harboring the disease-causing R94Q mutation in MFN2 are more susceptible to oxidative stress, which causes uncoupling of respiration and ATP production possibly by a less efficient mitochondrial quality control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29730305>Vaccination with three tandem repeats of  extracellular domain fused to Leismania major HSP70 protects mice against influenza A virus challenge.</a></h2><p>Influenza viruses are globally important respiratory pathogens with high degree of morbidity and mortality during annual epidemics. Influenza A vaccination has been challenged due to genetic evolution.  protein is the surface antigen of the virus and facilitates virus entry into the host cells. N-terminal 24 amino acid residues that constitute the extracellular domain of  protein (M2e) show remarkable conservation among all subtypes of influenza A viruses. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of using HSP70 as an adjuvant fused to three tandem repeats of M2e (3M2e) to enhance the immune responses against influenza A challenge. The mice were immunized three times by intradermal inoculations of 3M2e alone or in combination with Alum adjuvant or in fused form to HSP70. The specific immune responses were evaluated by measuring the serum antibody titers, lymphocyte proliferation, as well as Th1 and Th2 cytokines. The results showed that, although 3M2e with no adjuvant could induce secretion of specific antibodies, significantly higher humoral immune responses were stimulated in combination with Alum adjuvant (p < 0.05). Moreover, analysis of specific immune responses revealed that the 3M2e-HSP70 chimer protein mainly stimulated IgG2a and IFN-γ responses indicating aTh1 bias which shows the ability of HSP as a powerful adjuvant for activation of cellular immune responses. This was supported by a higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, significantly increased IL-4 production and lymphocyte proliferation (P ˂ 0.001) compared with mice vaccinated with 3M2e alone or supplemented with Alum, suggesting a mixture of Th1 and Th2 type cellular immune response with a Th1 bias. The findings of this study indicated that 3M2e-HSP70 enhances humoral and cellular immune responses and improves immune protection against influenza challenge in mice.

Legumain, an asparaginyl endopeptidase of the cysteine protease family, is overexpressed in macrophages in some pathological conditions. However, the macrophage subtype and function of macrophage-derived legumain remains unclear. To resolve this we tested whether  macrophages contribute to the accumulation of legumain in the unilateral ureteral obstruction model. Legumain-null mice exhibited more severe fibrotic lesions after obstruction compared with wild-type control. In vitro, IL4-stimulated  polarization led to the overexpression and secretion of legumain. The levels of fibronectin and collagen I/III, major components of the extracellular matrix, were reduced in the conditioned medium of TGF-β1-stimulated tubular epithelial cells or fibroblasts after treatment with legumain or conditioned medium from IL4-stimulated macrophages. Administration of the legumain inhibitor RR-11a exacerbated fibrotic lesions following obstruction. Therapeutically, adoptive transfer of legumain-overexpressing macrophages or IL4-stimulated macrophages ameliorated the deposition of collagen and fibronectin induced by ureteral obstruction, either in the wild-type mice or in lgmn mice. Thus,  macrophages overexpress and secret legumain and legumain mediates the anti-fibrotic effect of  macrophages in obstructive nephropathy.Copyright © 2018 International Society of Nephrology.

Targeting transcription factors, such as NF-κB p50, that mediate suppressive myeloid  polarization may prove therapeutic. GL261-Luc glioblastoma cells were inoculated into wild-type and p50 mice, followed by analysis of tumor growth, survival, tumor myeloid cells, and T cells. The absence of host p50 slows tumor growth and enables regression in 30% of recipients, leading to prolonged survival. Tumors developing in p50 mice possess a greater concentration of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) than those in wild-type mice. TIMs are predominantly F4/80 macrophages which, along with tumor-associated microglia, express increased pro-inflammatory M1 and reduced immune-suppressive  markers. In p50 mice, total tumor CD4 T cells are threefold more abundant, whereas CD8 T-cell numbers are unchanged, and both produce increased IFNγ and Granzyme B. Naïve splenic p50 CD8 T cells manifest increased activation, whereas naïve p50 and WT CD4 T cells show similar Th1, Th2, and Th17 polarization. Antibody targeting CD4, but not CD8, fully obviates the p50 survival advantage. Combined CD4 and CD8 T-cell depletion reverses myeloid  polarization in wild-type hosts, without affecting myeloid M1 polarization in p50 hosts. Finally, gliomas grow similarly in p50(f/f) and p50(f/f);Lysozyme-Cre mice, the latter having reduced p50 specifically in myeloid cells and tumor microglia. Thus, high-grade glioma T cells play a key role in directing  polarization of tumor myeloid cells, and reducing NF-κB p50 in both tumor myeloid cells and T cells may contribute to glioma therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30532146>Transcriptional profiling identifies novel regulators of macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are key inflammatory immune cells that display dynamic phenotypes and functions in response to their local microenvironment.

Moreover, the role of other regulatory mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, in macrophage polarization remains poorly understood. Here, we employed an optimized model of human M1 and  macrophage polarization which we used for large-scale transcriptional and DNA methylation profiling. We were unable to demonstrate a role for DNA methylation in macrophage polarization, as no significant changes were identified. However, we observed significant changes in the transcriptomes of M1 and  macrophages. Additionally, we identified numerous novel differentially regulated genes involved in macrophage polarization, including CYBB and DHCR7 which we show as important regulators of M1 and  macrophage polarization, respectively. Taken together, our improved in vitro human M1 and  macrophage model provides new understandings of the regulation of macrophage polarization and candidate macrophage biomarkers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30723582>Anticancer effects of anti-CD47  .</a></h2><p>The treatment of breast cancer largely depends on the utilization of immunogenic chemotherapeutics, which, as a common leitmotif, stimulate the exposure of calreticulin (CALR) on the surface of cancer cells, thereby facilitating their recognition by dendritic cells for the uptake of tumor-associated antigens and subsequent antigen cross-presentation to cytotoxic T cells. Breast cancer cells also express the calreticulin antagonist CD47, which inhibits tumor cell phagocytosis and consequently subverts anticancer immune responses. Here, we treated carcinogen-induced or transplantable mouse models of cancer by a CD47 blocking antibody that was at least as efficient as chemotherapy and that could be favorably combined with the anthracycline mitoxantrone in the context of carcinogen-induced orthotopic breast cancers. Monotherapy by CD47 blockade led to a reduction in tumor growth and an increase in overall survival. Of note, this treatment lead to a moderate depletion of  macrophages as well as close-to-complete elimination of regulatory T cells from the tumor bed, suggesting a strong favorable impact of CD47 blockade on the tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31375632>Immuno-PET identifies the myeloid compartment as a key contributor to the outcome of the antitumor response under PD-1 blockade.</a></h2><p> using checkpoint-blocking antibodies against PD-1 has produced impressive results in a wide range of cancers. However, the response remains heterogeneous among patients. We used noninvasive immuno-positron emission tomography (PET), using Zr-labeled PEGylated single-domain antibody fragments (nanobodies or VHHs), to explore the dynamics and distribution of intratumoral CD8 T cells and CD11b myeloid cells in response to anti-PD-1 treatment in the MC38 colorectal mouse adenocarcinoma model. Responding and nonresponding tumors showed consistent differences in the distribution of CD8 and CD11b cells. Anti-PD-1 treatment mobilized CD8 T cells from the tumor periphery to a more central location. Only those tumors fully infiltrated by CD8 T cells went on to complete resolution. All tumors contained CD11b myeloid cells from the outset of treatment, with later recruitment of additional CD11b cells. As tumors grew, the distribution of intratumoral CD11b cells became more heterogeneous. Shrinkage of tumors in responders correlated with an increase in the CD11b population in the center of the tumors. The changes in distribution of CD8 and CD11b cells, as assessed by PET, served as biomarkers to gauge the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of RNA from intratumoral CD45 cells showed that CD11b cells in responders and nonresponders were markedly different. The responders exhibited a dominant population of macrophages with an M1-like signature, while the CD45 population in the nonresponders displayed an -like transcriptional signature. Thus, by using immuno-PET and single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that anti-PD-1 treatment not only affects interactions of CD8 T cells with the tumor but also impacts the intratumoral myeloid compartment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433212>Vaccine against gastrin, a polyclonal antibody stimulator, decreases pancreatic cancer metastases.</a></h2><p>Growth of pancreatic cancer is stimulated by gastrin in both a paracrine and an autocrine fashion. Traditional therapies have not significantly improved survival, and recently pancreatic cancer has been deemed a "cold" tumor due to its poor response to . Strategies to improve survival of pancreatic cancer are desperately needed. In the current investigation, we studied the effects of an anti-gastrin cancer vaccine, polyclonal antibody stimulator (PAS; formerly called G17DT and Gastrimmune), used alone or in combination with a programmed cell death receptor (PD)-1 immune checkpoint antibody on pancreatic cancer growth, metastases, and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Immune-competent female C57BL/6 mice bearing syngeneic orthotopic murine pancreatic cancer treated with PAS had significantly smaller tumors and fewer metastases. Examination of the TME demonstrated decreased fibrosis with fewer  and more M1 tumor-associated macrophages. Expression of the  gene was significantly increased and expression of the  gene was decreased compared with controls. Mice treated with PAS or the combination of PAS and PD-1 antibody exhibited significantly less tumor expression of phospho-paxillin, the focal adhesion protein β-catenin, and matrix metalloproteinase-7. This study suggests that inhibition of the cancer-promoting effects of gastrin in pancreatic cancer can decrease metastases by altering the TME and decreasing pathways that activate the epithelial mesenchymal transition. The PAS vaccine appears to change the TME, making it more susceptible to therapy with an immune checkpoint antibody. This novel combination of two immunotherapies may improve survival of pancreatic cancer by decreasing both tumor growth and metastasis formation. Survival from advanced pancreatic cancer is poor, in part due to dense fibrosis of the tumor microenvironment, increased number of -polarized macrophages that promote angiogenesis and invasion, and lack of "target-specific" therapy. Herein, we report that a tumor vaccine that selectively targets gastrin decreases pancreatic cancer growth and metastases. Furthermore, the gastrin vaccine polyclonal antibody stimulator alters the tumor microenvironment rendering it more responsive to  with a programmed cell death receptor-1 immune checkpoint antibody.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29491374>Chloroquine modulates antitumor immune response by resetting tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype.</a></h2><p>Resetting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is a promising strategy to ameliorate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve innate and adaptive antitumor immunity. Here we show that chloroquine (CQ), a proven anti-malarial drug, can function as an antitumor immune modulator that switches TAMs from  to tumor-killing M1 phenotype. Mechanistically, CQ increases macrophage lysosomal pH, causing Ca release via the lysosomal Ca channel mucolipin-1 (Mcoln1), which induces the activation of p38 and NF-κB, thus polarizing TAMs to M1 phenotype. In parallel, the released Ca activates transcription factor EB (TFEB), which reprograms the metabolism of TAMs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. As a result, CQ-reset macrophages ameliorate tumor immune microenvironment by decreasing immunosuppressive infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and Treg cells, thus enhancing antitumor T-cell immunity. These data illuminate a previously unrecognized antitumor mechanism of CQ, suggesting a potential new macrophage-based tumor immunotherapeutic modality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30963193>Immune-phenotyping of pleomorphic dermal sarcomas suggests this entity as a potential candidate for .</a></h2><p>Pleomorphic dermal sarcomas (PDS) are sarcomas of the skin with local recurrences in up to 28% of cases, and distant metastases in up to 20%. Although recent evidence provides a strong rational to explore immunotherapeutics in solid tumors, nothing is known about the immune environment of PDS.In the current study, a comprehensive immune-phenotyping of 14 PDS using RNA and protein expression analyses, as well as quantitative assessment of immune cells using an image-analysis tool was performed.Three out of 14 PDS revealed high levels of CD8-positive tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs), also showing elevated levels of immune-related cytokines such as IL1A, IL2, as well as markers that were very recently linked to enhanced response of  in malignant melanoma, including CD27, and CD40L. Using a multivariate analysis, we found a number of differentially expressed genes in the CD8-high group including: CD74, LYZ and HLA-B, while the remaining cases revealed enhanced levels of immune-suppressive cytokines including CXCL14. The "CD8-high" PDS showed strong MHC-I expression and revealed infiltration by PD-L1-, PD-1- and LAG-3-expressing immune cells. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) predominantly consisted of CD68 + , CD163 + , and CD204 +  macrophages showing an accentuation at the tumor invasion front.Together, we provide first explorative evidence about the immune-environment of PDS tumors that may guide future decisions whether individuals presenting with advanced PDS could qualify for immunotherapeutic options.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30838801>Simultaneous T Cell Activation and Macrophage Polarization to Promote Potent Tumor Suppression by Iron Oxide-Embedded Large-Pore Mesoporous Organosilica Core-Shell Nanospheres.</a></h2><p>Nanomaterial-based  stimulating T cell activation or tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) conversion holds great promise for promoting tumor suppression. Herein, a novel nanoplatform, iron oxide-embedded large-pore mesoporous organosilica nanospheres (IO-LPMONs), is prepared for the first time to simultaneously activate cytotoxic T cells and polarize macrophages for potent tumor . The IO-LPMONs have large mesopores (6.3 nm) and inorganic-organic hybrid shells, which contribute to a high payload (500 µg mg ) of the antigen ovalbumin (OVA). The IO-LPMONs effectively deliver OVA to dendritic cells (DCs) and activate DCs. Subsequently, high activation of both CD4 and CD8 effector antigen-specific T cells is achieved for powerful antitumor effects. Moreover, the IO-LPMONs also act as an immune modulator to polarize TAMs from an immunosuppressive  to a tumor-killing M1 phenotype, which induces efficient apoptosis of tumor cells. The combined T cell activation and macrophage polarization strategy based on the IO-LPMONs elicits remarkable combined antitumor effects in vivo, showing great promise for tumor treatment.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We have reported that neonatal vaccination with a hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) transiently impairs mood status and spatial memory involving a systemic T helper (Th) 2 bias and M1 microglial activation. Here, an EE induced microglial anti-inflammatory  polarization, as evidenced by selectively enhanced expression of the Arginase1 gene (Arg-1) in the hippocampus. Interestingly, knock-down of the Arg-1 gene prevented the effects of EE on restoring the dendritic spine density. Moreover, levels of the Th1-derived cytokine IFN-gamma (IFN-γ) were elevated in the choroid plexus (CP), which is the interface between the brain and the periphery. IFN-γ-blocking antibodies blunted the protective effects of an EE on spine density and LTP. Furthermore, levels of complement proteins C1q and C3 were elevated, and this elevation was associated with synapse loss induced by the HBV, whereas an EE reversed the effects of the HBV. Similarly, blockade of C1q activation clearly prevented synaptic pruning by microglia, LTP inhibition and memory deficits in hepatitis B-vaccinated mice. Together, the EE-induced increase in IFN-γ levels in the CP may disrupt systemic immunosuppression related to HBV via an IFN-γ/Arg-1/complement-dependent pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, cancer cells secrete macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF), which polarizes tumour-associated macrophages from an antitumour M1 phenotype to a pro-tumourigenic  phenotype. Also, cancer cells can express CD47, an 'eat me not' signal that ligates with the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) receptor on macrophages to prevent phagocytosis. Here, we show that a supramolecular assembly consisting of amphiphiles inhibiting the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) and displaying SIRPα-blocking antibodies with a drug-to-antibody ratio of 17,000 can disable both mechanisms. The supramolecule homes onto SIRPα on macrophages, blocking the CD47-SIRPα signalling axis while sustainedly inhibiting CSF-1R. The supramolecule enhances the -to-M1 repolarization within the tumour microenvironment, and significantly improves antitumour and antimetastatic efficacies in two aggressive animal models of melanoma and breast cancer, with respect to clinically available small-molecule and biologic inhibitors of CSF-1R signalling. Simultaneously blocking the CD47-SIRPα and MCSF-CSF-1R signalling axes may constitute a promising .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29601534>Heterogeneity in Immune Cell Content in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.</a></h2><p>Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive cancer with limited therapy options and dismal prognosis. In recent years, the role of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) has become a major area of interest. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of heterogeneity in immune cell content and checkpoint expression in MPM in relation to prognosis and prediction of treatment efficacy. Generally, immune-suppressive cells such as  macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells are present within the TME, with extensive heterogeneity in cell numbers. Infiltration of effector cells such as cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells and T helper cells is commonly found, also with substantial patient to patient heterogeneity. PD-L1 expression also varied greatly (16-65%). The infiltration of immune cells in tumor and associated stroma holds key prognostic and predictive implications. As such, there is a strong rationale for thoroughly mapping the TME to better target therapy in mesothelioma. Researchers should be aware of the extensive possibilities that exist for a tumor to evade the cytotoxic killing from the immune system. Therefore, no "one size fits all" treatment is likely to be found and focus should lie on the heterogeneity of the tumors and TME.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29884457>Distinct Activities of Glycolytic Enzymes Identify Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients with a more Aggressive Course and Resistance to Chemo-.</a></h2><p>A higher capacity to grow under hypoxic conditions can lead to a more aggressive behavior of tumor cells. Determining tumor activity under hypoxia may identify chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with aggressive clinical course and predict response to chemo- (CIT). A metabolic score was generated by determining pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, key enzymes of glycolysis, ex vivo in primary CLL samples under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. This score was further correlated with clinical endpoints and response to CIT in 96 CLL patients. 45 patients were classified as metabolic high risk (HR), 51 as low risk (LR). Treatment-free survival (TFS) was significantly shorter in HR patients (median 394 vs 723 days, p = .021). 15 HR patients and 14 LR patients received CIT after sample acquisition. HR patients had a significantly shorter progression-free survival after treatment compared to LR patients (median 216 days vs not reached, p = .008). Multivariate analysis evaluating age, IGHV, TP53 deletion or mutation and 11q22-23 deletion besides the capacity of tumor cells to grow under severe hypoxic conditions identified the metabolic profile as the strongest independent risk factor for shorter TFS (hazard ratio 2.37, p = .011).

CD200 is another checkpoint modulator whose receptor is found on tumor-promoting myeloid cells, including  macrophages. We found high  mRNA expression in MCC tumors, and CD200 immunostaining was demonstrated on 95.5% of MCC tumors. CD200R-expressing myeloid cells were present in the MCC tumor microenvironment. MCC-associated macrophages had a higher average CD163:CD68 staining ratio (2.67) than controls (1.13), indicating an immunosuppressive  phenotype. Accordingly, MCC tumors contained increased densities of FOXP3 regulatory T-cells. Intravenous administration of blocking anti-CD200 antibody to MCC xenograft mice revealed specific targeting of drug to tumor. In conclusion, MCC are highly CD200 positive and associated with immunosuppressive  macrophages and regulatory T-cells.

However, the impact of Fn infection on macrophage polarization and subsequent intestinal tumour formation as well as the underlying molecular pathways has not been investigated. We investigated the impact of Fn infection on macrophage polarization in human CRCs and cultured macrophages as well as the effects on macrophage phenotype and intestinal tumour formation in Apc mice. We also examined whether macrophage-polarized activation challenged by Fn infection via a TLR4-dependent mechanism involved the IL-6/STAT3/c-MYC signalling cascade. Our data showed that macrophages are a major tumour-infiltrating immune cell type in human CRCs with Fn infection (P < 0.001). Fn infection increased  polarization of macrophages in vitro and in vivo, leading to intestinal tumour growth in Apc mice. Moreover, Fn infection induced high expression of TLR4, IL-6, STAT3, p-STAT3, and c-MYC in cultured macrophages challenged with Fn, which was blocked by TAK-242 pre-treatment (P < 0.05). Interestingly, c-MYC protein was mainly co-localized with CD206  macrophages with Fn infection. In conclusion, we show that Fn infection increased  polarization of macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Fn infection enhanced colorectal tumour growth in a TLR4-dependent manner involving activation of the IL-6/p-STAT3/c-MYC signalling pathway. For the first time, our results indicate an immunosuppressive effect of Fn by promoting  polarization of macrophages through a TLR4-dependent mechanism, which may serve as a promising target for  of Fn-related CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560714>IGFBP2 promotes immunosuppression associated with its mesenchymal induction and FcγRIIB phosphorylation in glioblastoma.</a></h2><p> shows a promise for treating glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant and immunosuppressive glioma. The mesenchymal phenotype of cancer cells was frequently reported to be associated with their induction of immunosuppression within the cancer microenvironment. Overexpressed insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) promotes GBM cell migration and invasion, and contributes to glioma progression and cancer recurrence and poor survival in GBM. However, whether IGFBP2 can induce immunosuppression in GBM was not reported yet. Thus, the study applied a syngeneic mouse GBM model, human GBM samples, and cancer-immune cell co-culture experiments to investigate the effect of IGFBP2 on GBM exposed immune cells and its association with the mesenchymal induction. We found that IGFBP2 promoted the mesenchymal feature of GBM cells. The inhibition of IGFBP2 relieved immunosuppression by increasing CD8+ T and CD19+ B cells and decreasing CD163+  macrophages. Further, the IGFBP2-promoted immunosuppression was associated with its induction of the mesenchymal feature of GBM cells and the inhibitory phosphorylated FcγRIIB of GBM exposed immune cells. Blocking IGFBP2 suppressed tumor growth and improved survival of tumor bearing mice in the mouse GBM model. These findings support the notion that targeting the IGFBP2 may present an effective immunotherapeutic strategy for mesenchymal GBMs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30282813>Immune Effector Functions of Human IgG2 Antibodies against EGFR.</a></h2><p>Three FDA-approved epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies (cetuximab, panitumumab, necitumumab) are clinically available to treat patients with different types of cancers. Interestingly, panitumumab is of human IgG2 isotype, which is often considered to have limited immune effector functions. Unexpectedly, our studies unraveled that human IgG2 antibodies against EGFR mediated effective CDC when combined with another noncross-blocking EGFR antibody. This second antibody could be of human IgG1 or IgG2 isotype. Furthermore, EGFR antibodies of human IgG2 isotype were highly potent in recruiting myeloid effector cells such as M1 macrophages and PMN for tumor cell killing by ADCC. Tumor cell killing by PMN was more effective with IgG2 than with IgG1 antibodies if tumor cells expressed lower levels of EGFR. Additionally, lower expression levels of the "don't eat me" molecule CD47 on tumor cells enabled ADCC also by  macrophages, and improved PMN and macrophage-mediated ADCC. A TCGA enquiry revealed broadly varying CD47 expression levels across different solid tumor types. Together, these results demonstrate that human IgG2 antibodies against EGFR can promote significant Fc-mediated effector functions, which may contribute to their clinical efficacy.

The objective of this study was to develop a risk prediction model for S. aureus SSI or bacteremia after cardiothoracic surgery based on pre-operative variables.Data from the Merck Phase IIb/III S. aureus vaccine (V710-P003) clinical trial were analyzed. In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, the effect of preoperative vaccination against S. aureus was investigated in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. The primary outcome was deep/superficial S. aureus SSI or S. aureus bacteremia through day 90 after surgery. Performance, calibration, and discrimination of the final model were assessed.Overall 164 out of 7,647 included patients (2.1%) developed S. aureus infection (149 SSI, 15 bacteremia, 28 both). Independent risk factors for developing the primary outcome were pre-operative colonization with S. aureus (OR 3.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.23-4.22), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.34-2.60), BMI (OR 1.02 per kg/, 95% CI 0.99-1.05), and CABG (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.91-3.78). Although vaccination had a significant (albeit modest) protective effect, it was omitted from the model because its addition did not significantly change the coefficients of the final model and V710-vaccine development has been discontinued due to insufficient efficacy. The final prediction model had moderate discriminative accuracy (AUC-value, 0.72).Pre-operative S. aureus colonization status, diabetes mellitus, BMI, and type of surgical procedure moderately predicted the risk of S. aureus SSI and/or bacteremia among patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30407504>Identification and validation of novel microenvironment-based immune molecular subgroups of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: implications for .</a></h2><p>Targeting the immune checkpoint pathway has demonstrated antitumor cytotoxicity in treatment-refractory head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC). To understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning its antitumor response, we characterized the immune landscape of HNSC by their tumor and stromal compartments to identify novel immune molecular subgroups.A training cohort of 522 HNSC samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas profiled by RNA sequencing was analyzed. We separated gene expression patterns from tumor, stromal, and immune cell gene using a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. We correlated the expression patterns with a set of immune-related gene signatures, potential immune biomarkers, and clinicopathological features. Six independent datasets containing 838 HNSC samples were used for validation.Approximately 40% of HNSCs in the cohort (211/522) were identified to show enriched inflammatory response, enhanced cytolytic activity, and active interferon-γ signaling (all, P < 0.001). We named this new molecular class of tumors the Immune Class. Then we found it contained two distinct microenvironment-based subtypes, characterized by markers of active or exhausted immune response. The Exhausted Immune Class was characterized by enrichment of activated stroma and anti-inflammatory  macrophage signatures, WNT/transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway activation and poor survival (all, P < 0.05). An enriched proinflammatory M1 macrophage signature, enhanced cytolytic activity, abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, high human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and favorable prognosis were associated with Active Immune Class (all, P < 0.05). The robustness of these immune molecular subgroups was verified in the validation cohorts, and Active Immune Class showed potential response to programmed cell death-1 blockade (P = 0.01).This study revealed a novel Immune Class in HNSC; two subclasses characterized by active or exhausted immune responses were also identified. These findings provide new insights into tailoring immunotherapeutic strategies for different HNSC subgroups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29399202>Characterization of cluster of differentiation 47 expression and its potential as a therapeutic target in esophageal squamous cell cancer.</a></h2><p>The increased expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)47 has been identified in a number of different tumor types and is recognized as an adverse prognostic factor that indicates an increased risk of mortality in patients. The binding of CD47 to signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) inhibits the macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells by triggering an inhibitory 'do not eat me' signal. This is one of the mechanisms used by tumor cells to evade immune surveillance. In the present study, CD47 levels and macrophage infiltration were assessed in patients with esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). CD47-overexpressing ESCC cell lines were selected and human  macrophage phagocytic activity was measured. The results revealed that CD47 is highly expressed and macrophages are markedly infiltrated in cancerous tissue compared with non-cancerous tissue. High CD47 expression was detected in ESCC cell lines and the results of a phagocytosis assay indicated that human  macrophages phagocytized tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner following the blocking of CD47-SIRPα signaling by anti-CD47 antibodies. The results of the present study therefore support the use of anti-CD47  to treat patients with ESCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481662>Genetic programming of macrophages to perform anti-tumor functions using targeted mRNA nanocarriers.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) usually express an  phenotype, which enables them to perform immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting functions. Reprogramming these TAMs toward an M1 phenotype could thwart their pro-cancer activities and unleash anti-tumor immunity, but efforts to accomplish this are nonspecific and elicit systemic inflammation. Here we describe a targeted nanocarrier that can deliver in vitro-transcribed mRNA encoding M1-polarizing transcription factors to reprogram TAMs without causing systemic toxicity. We demonstrate in models of ovarian cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma that infusions of nanoparticles formulated with mRNAs encoding interferon regulatory factor 5 in combination with its activating kinase IKKβ reverse the immunosuppressive, tumor-supporting state of TAMs and reprogram them to a phenotype that induces anti-tumor immunity and promotes tumor regression. We further establish that these nanoreagents are safe for repeated dosing. Implemented in the clinic, this  could enable physicians to obviate suppressive tumors while avoiding systemic treatments that disrupt immune homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866759>Protection against homo and hetero-subtypic inﬂuenza A virus by optimized M2e DNA vaccine.</a></h2><p>Current influenza vaccines provide hemagglutinin strain-specific protection, but rarely provide cross-protection against divergent strains. It is, therefore, particularly important to develop a universal vaccine against conserved proteins or conserved regions of the virus. In this study, we used N-terminal extracellular region of the influenza virus  protein (M2e) as the target antigen and constructed two optimized M2e DNA vaccines (p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e) with increased antigenic epitope density and enhanced antigen secretion. Both vaccines induced high M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in the vaccinated mice. These two vaccines also conferred protection against a lethal infection of homo-subtypic H1N1 virus, with p-tPA-p3M2e being the most effective. In addition, p-tPA-p3M2e also showed cross-protection against different subtypes of the influenza virus (H9N2, H6N6, and H10N8) at varying rates (80%, 40%, and 20%, respectively). After passive immunization, M2e DNA vaccine-induced antibodies in the sera provided complete protection against homologous virus challenge. An analysis of the mechanism underlying this immunization-mediated protection indicates that M2e-specific IgG and T-cell immune responses may play critical roles in the prevention of infection and viral clearance.

In particular, therapeutic manipulation of tumor-associated macrophages holds promise due to their various and sometimes opposing roles in tumor progression. It is established that M1-type macrophages suppress tumor progression while -types support it. Recently, Tie2-expressing macrophages (TEM) have been identified as a distinct sub-population influencing tumor angiogenesis and vascular remodeling as well as monocyte differentiation.This study develops a modeling framework to evaluate macrophage interactions with the tumor microenvironment, enabling assessment of how these interactions may affect tumor progression. M1, , and Tie2 expressing variants are integrated into a model of tumor growth representing a metastatic lesion in a highly vascularized organ, such as the liver. Behaviors simulated include M1 release of nitric oxide (NO),  release of growth-promoting factors, and TEM facilitation of angiogenesis via Angiopoietin-2 and promotion of monocyte differentiation into  via IL-10.The results show that  presence leads to larger tumor growth regardless of TEM effects, implying that immunotherapeutic strategies that lead to TEM ablation may fail to restrain growth when the  represents a sizeable population. As TEM pro-tumor effects are less pronounced and on a longer time scale than M1-driven tumor inhibition, a more nuanced approach to influence monocyte differentiation taking into account the tumor state (e.g., under chemotherapy) may be desirable.The results highlight the dynamic interaction of macrophages within a growing tumor, and, further, establish the initial feasibility of a mathematical framework that could longer term help to optimize cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30449733>An Oncolytic Virus Expressing a T-cell Engager Simultaneously Targets Cancer and Immunosuppressive Stromal Cells.</a></h2><p>: Effective  of stromal-rich tumors requires simultaneous targeting of cancer cells and immunosuppressive elements of the microenvironment. Here, we modified the oncolytic group B adenovirus enadenotucirev to express a stroma-targeted bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE). This BiTE bound fibroblast activation protein on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and CD3ε on T cells, leading to potent T-cell activation and fibroblast death. Treatment of fresh clinical biopsies, including malignant ascites and solid prostate cancer tissue, with FAP-BiTE-encoding virus induced activation of tumor-infiltrating PD1 T cells to kill CAFs. In ascites, this led to depletion of CAF-associated immunosuppressive factors, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased gene expression of markers of antigen presentation, T-cell function, and trafficking. -like ascites macrophages exhibited a proinflammatory repolarization, indicating spectrum-wide alteration of the tumor microenvironment.

Currently, exploring the differences of the immune status in GC patients with different subgroups might provide promising immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of GC.In this study, a total of 598 surgically resected FFPE primary gastric cancer samples were assessed for FOXP3, CD163, CD3, CD8, and PD-L1 markers. The correlations between the immune markers expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis were investigated retrospectively.In general, PD-L1, CD3, and CD8 could be regarded as favorable prognostic factors. Our data demonstrated that high infiltration of FOXP3 Treg indicates better prognosis in stage I-II patients, while the converse outcome was noted in stage III-IV patients. Our data also confirmed different prognostic value in different pathological classifications, chemotherapy strategies, and locations, with or without lymph node metastasis. Also,  macrophages indicated poor prognosis in general. However, high  macrophage infiltration suggests a favorable prognosis in signet ring cell carcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the prognostic value of the two indices when they are combined is reported.These results suggested that different immune statuses are exhibited in different subgroups of GC, which may direct further understanding of the immune status of GC as well as provide a further theoretical basis and potential targets for GC .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31093687>Microglial priming of antigen presentation and adaptive stimulation in Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>The prominent pathological consequences of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the misfolding and mis-sorting of two cellular proteins, amyloid-β and microtubule-associated protein Tau. The accumulation of toxic phosphorylated Tau inside the neurons induces the increased processing of amyloid-β-associated signaling cascade and vice versa. Neuroinflammation-driven synaptic depletion and cognitive decline are substantiated by the cross talk of activated microglia and astroglia, leading to neuron degeneration. Microglia are the brain-resident immune effectors that prove their diverse functions in maintaining CNS homeostasis via collaboration with astrocytes and T lymphocytes. Age-related senescence and chronic inflammation activate microglia with increased pro-inflammatory markers, oxidative damage and phagocytosis. But the improper processing of misfolded protein via lysosomal pathway destines the spreading of 'seed' constituents to the nearby healthy neurons. Primed microglia process and present self-antigen such as amyloid-β and modified Tau to the infiltrated T lymphocytes through MHC I/II molecules. After an effective conversation with CD4 T cells, microglial phenotype can be altered from pro-active M1 to neuro-protective  type, which corresponds to the tissue remodeling and homeostasis. In this review, we are focusing on the change in functionality of microglia from innate to adaptive immune response in the context of neuroprotection, which may help in the search of novel immune therapy in AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30170190>Therapeutic implication of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) targeting in cancer cells and tumor microenvironment by competitive and non-competitive inhibitors.</a></h2><p>The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) is a tyrosine kinase receptor for VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth factor (PlGF) ligands that is expressed in endothelial, myelomonocytic and tumor cells. VEGF-B and PlGF exclusively bind to VEGFR-1, whereas VEGF-A also binds to VEGFR-2. At variance with VEGFR-2, VEGFR-1 does not play a relevant role in physiological angiogenesis in the adult, while it is important in tumor-associated angiogenesis. VEGFR-1 and PlGF are expressed in a variety of tumors, promote invasiveness and contribute to resistance to anti-VEGF-A therapy. The currently approved antiangiogenic therapies for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors hamper VEGF-A signaling mediated by both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1 [i.e., the monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-VEGF-A bevacizumab, the chimeric molecule aflibercept and several small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors] or exclusively by VEGFR-2 (i.e., the mAb anti-VEGFR-2 ramucirumab). However, molecules that interfere with VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling determine severe adverse effects due to inhibition of physiological angiogenesis and their efficacy is hampered by tumor infiltration of protumoral myeloid cells. Blockade of VEGFR-1 may exert anti-tumor activity by multiple mechanisms: a) inhibition of tumor-associated angiogenesis; b) reduction of myeloid progenitor mobilization and tumor infiltration by VEGFR-1 expressing  macrophages, which contribute to tumor progression and spreading; c) inhibition of invasiveness, vasculogenic mimicry and survival of VEGFR-1 positive tumor cells. As a consequence of these properties, molecules targeting VEGFR-1 are expected to produce less adverse effects and to counteract resistance towards anti-VEGF-A therapies. More interestingly, selective VEGFR-1 inhibition might enhance the efficacy of  with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this review, we will examine the experimental evidence available so far that supports targeting VEGFR-1 signal transduction pathway for cancer treatment by competitive inhibitors that prevent growth factor interaction with the receptor and non-competitive inhibitors that hamper receptor activation without affecting ligand binding.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In the course of development of a universal vaccine, it is necessary to consider that immunity must be generated even against viruses from different hosts because new human epidemic virus strains have their origins in viruses of birds and other animals. We have enriched conserved viral proteins-nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein 2 ()-by B and T-cell epitopes not only human origin but also swine and avian origin. For this purpose, we analyzed  and NP sequences with respect to changes in the sequences of known T and B-cell epitopes and chose conserved and evolutionarily significant epitopes. Eventually, we found consensus sequences of  and NP that have the maximum quantity of epitopes that are 100% coincident with them. Consensus epitope-enriched amino acid sequences of  and NP proteins were included in a recombinant adenoviral vector. Immunization with Ad5-tet-M2NP induced strong CD8 and CD4 T cells responses, specific to each of the encoded antigens, i.e.  and NP. Eight months after immunization with Ad5-tet-M2NP, high numbers of - and NP-responding "effector memory" CD44posCD62neg T cells were found in the mouse spleens, which revealed a long-term T cell immune memory conferred by the immunization. In all, the challenge experiments showed an extraordinarily wide-ranging efficacy of protection by the Ad5-tet-M2NP vaccine, covering 5 different heterosubtypes of influenza A virus (2 human, 2 avian and 1 swine).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30290778>Long-term desensitization for ABO-incompatible living related kidney transplantation recipients with high refractory and rebound anti-blood type antibody: case report.</a></h2><p>ABO-incompatible living related kidney transplantation (ABO-iLKT) has increased the possibilities for kidney transplantation in patients with end stage renal disease. Due to advancements in immunosuppressive agents and the identification of immunological conditions following ABO-iLKT, this transplantation technique has achieved the same success rate as ABO-compatible LKT. However, some patients continue to generate anti-blood type antibodies, despite conventional immunosuppressant treatment.A 60-year-old man was referred to our hospital for kidney transplantation. The proposed transplant was ABO incompatible, from a donor with blood-type A to a recipient with blood-type O. The recipient's anti-A blood-type IgG antibody titer was measured at 4096-fold dilution. Following desensitization therapy, including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 750 mg/day for 3 months, intravenous Rituximab 200 mg, and two sessions of double filtration plasmapheresis, the anti-A blood-type IgG antibody titer decreased to only 516-fold dilution and did not meet our target of less than 128-fold dilution. MMF was thus continued for an additional 4 months and four additional sessions of plasmapheresis were undertaken. Following these interventions, antibody titers decreased to 128-fold dilution and ABO-iLKT was performed. Following transplant, antibody-mediated rejection was not observed and renal function was preserved. However, a post-operative renal biopsy 1.5 months later showed evidence of T-cell-mediated rejection IB. The patient was treated with steroids, with no increase in serum creatinine.Our findings suggest that the long-term single MMF desensitization therapy could be a suitable option for ABO-iLKT with high refractory and rebound anti-blood type antibody. Further studies are required to establish the optimal immunosuppression regimen to control B cell- mediated immunity in ABO-iLKT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29477032>3D-3-culture: A tool to unveil macrophage plasticity in the tumour microenvironment.</a></h2><p>The tumour microenvironment (TME) shapes disease progression and influences therapeutic response. Most aggressive solid tumours have high levels of myeloid cell infiltration, namely tumour associated macrophages (TAM). Recapitulation of the interaction between the different cellular players of the TME, along with the extracellular matrix (ECM), is critical for understanding the mechanisms underlying disease progression. This particularly holds true for prediction of therapeutic response(s) to standard therapies and interrogation of efficacy of TME-targeting agents. In this work, we explored a culture platform based on alginate microencapsulation and stirred culture systems to develop the 3D-3-culture, which entails the co-culture of tumour cell spheroids of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) and monocytes. We demonstrate that the 3D-3-culture recreates an invasive and immunosuppressive TME, with accumulation of cytokines/chemokines (IL4, IL10, IL13, CCL22, CCL24, CXCL1), ECM elements (collagen type I, IV and fibronectin) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1/9), supporting cell migration and promoting cell-cell interactions within the alginate microcapsules. Importantly, we show that both the monocytic cell line THP-1 and peripheral blood-derived monocytes infiltrate the tumour tissue and transpolarize into an -like macrophage phenotype expressing CD68, CD163 and CD206, resembling the TAM phenotype in NSCLC. The 3D-3-culture was challenged with chemo- and immunotherapeutic agents and the response to therapy was assessed in each cellular component. Specifically, the macrophage phenotype was modulated upon treatment with the CSF1R inhibitor BLZ945, resulting in a decrease of the -like macrophages. In conclusion, the crosstalk between the ECM and tumour, stromal and immune cells in microencapsulated 3D-3-culture promotes the activation of monocytes into TAM, mimicking aggressive tumour stages. The 3D-3-culture constitutes a novel tool to study tumour-immune interaction and macrophage plasticity in response to external stimuli, such as chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory drugs.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

We and others have previously reported -TAM infiltration in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).To determine whether the extent of -TAM infiltration correlates with PC aggressiveness.Normal prostate tissue, localized PC, and mCRPC samples from 192 patients were retrospectively analyzed.We analytically validated an immunohistochemistry assay for detection of the human mannose receptor (CD206) to assess  macrophage involvement.Multiplex immunofluorescent staining showed that a small fraction of CD206 staining co-localized with the endothelial cells of lymphatic vessels, while the vast majority of staining occurred in CD68-positive macrophages. The area fraction of staining for CD206-positive macrophages increased in a stepwise fashion from normal (ie, no inflammation) prostate tissue, to primary untreated carcinomas, to hormone-naïve regional lymph node metastases, to mCRPC. Complementary studies using flow cytometry confirmed CD206-positive -TAM infiltration. Limitations include the small number of rapid autopsy samples and the lack of neuroendocrine PC samples.Our results revealed a progressive increase in CD206-positive macrophages from normal prostate to mCRPC. Given the immunosuppressive nature of macrophages and the lack of clinical success of  for PC patients, our results provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of macrophages in the PC microenvironment as a potential method to augment immunotherapeutic responses.In this report we used 192 prostate cancer samples to determine if  macrophage infiltration is correlated with castration resistance in prostate cancer.Copyright © 2018.

Despite the deep tissue penetration of NIR light in living systems, the therapeutic efficiency is greatly restricted by insufficient oxygen supply in hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the coexistent tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play critical roles in tumor recurrence during the post-PDT period. Herein, we developed a unique photosensitizer-loaded UCNs nanoconjugate (PUN) by integrating manganese dioxide (MnO) nanosheets and hyaluronic acid (HA) biopolymer to improve NIR light-mediated PDT efficacy through attenuating hypoxia status and synergistically reprogramming TAMs populations. After the reaction with overproduced HO in acidic tumor microenvironment, the MnO nanosheets were degraded for the production of massive oxygen to greatly enhance the oxygen-dependent PDT efficiency upon 808 nm NIR light irradiation. More importantly, the bioinspired polymer HA could effectively reprogram the polarization of pro-tumor -type TAMs to anti-tumor M1-type macrophages to prevent tumor relapse after PDT treatment. Such promising results provided the great opportunities to achieve enhanced cellular ablation upon NIR light-mediated PDT treatment by attenuating hypoxic tumor microenvironment, and thus facilitated the rational design of new generations of nanoplatforms toward  to inhibit tumor recurrence during post-PDT period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779113>Poly(I:C) stimulation is superior than Imiquimod to induce the antitumoral functional profile of tumor-conditioned macrophages.</a></h2><p>Macrophage plasticity is the ability of mononuclear phagocytes to change phenotype, function, and genetic reprogramming upon encounter of specific local stimuli. In the tumor microenvironment, Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) acquire an immune-suppressive and tumor-promoting phenotype. With the aim to re-educate TAMs to antitumor effectors, in this study, we used two immunestimulatory compounds: the TLR7 agonist Imiquimod (IMQ) and the TLR3 agonist Poly(I:C). To better mimic in vitro the response of TAMs, we used Tumor-Conditioned Macrophages (TC-Mϕ) differentiated in the presence of tumor cell supernatants. Our results show that TC-Mϕ respond differently from conventional -polarized macrophages. Upon stimulation with IMQ, TC-Mϕ did not upregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC II) molecules and unexpectedly expressed increased CD206. With both compounds, TC-Mϕ produced higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than  macrophages. IMQ and Poly(I:C) differed in the types of regulated genes and secreted mediators. Reflecting their signaling pathways, only IMQ significantly induced IL-1β and IL-6, while only Poly(I:C) stimulated CXCL10, and both upregulated CCL5. Of note, using a novel cytotoxicity assay, Poly(I:C), but not IMQ, was effective in triggering the cytotoxic activity of TC-Mϕ against cancer cells. Overall, the results demonstrate that Poly(I:C) stimulation of TC-Mϕ is superior than IMQ in terms of macrophage re-education toward antitumor effectors.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, the nanoparticles extracted from cuttlefish ink (CINPs) with significant antitumor efficacy are explored. These CINPs, with spherical morphology, good dispersibility, and biocompatibility, are rich in melanin and contain a variety of amino acids and monosaccharides. Through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, CINPs can efficiently reprogram tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from immune-suppressive -like phenotype to antitumor M1-like phenotype. Besides, under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, CINPs exhibit high photothermal effect and tumor cell killing ability, which make them a potential candidate in photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumor. , CINPs can increase the proportion of M1 macrophages and foster the recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to tumors, leading to reduced primary tumor growth and lung metastasis. In combination with their photothermal effect, which can induce tumor-specific antigens release, CINPs could almost completely inhibit tumor growth accompanied by more active immune responses. Collectively, these CINPs described here can provide both tumor  and PTT, implying that CINPs are promising for tumor treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29924356>Meta-analysis of the effects of intensive rearing environments on the performance and welfare of broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>To better understand how relevant intensive systems' characteristics simultaneously affect the performance and welfare of broiler chickens, a meta-analysis of recent literature was carried out. The study determined the effects of gender, genetics, experimental initial age (EIA, d), stocking density (SD; kg/), group size (GS; n), bedding material (yes/no), duration of photoperiod (DP; h), divided scotoperiod (yes/no), feeding phases (1/2/3/>3), environmental control (EC; yes/no), environmental enrichment (yes/no), use of vaccines and other medications (yes/no), experimental duration (d), and relevant 2-way interactions on average daily gain (g/d), average daily feed intake (g/d), FCR (g: g), mortality (%), behavior (%), and gait score (mean value). Predictive equations for response variables were calculated using multiple regression models including a random experiment effect. Among other results, EIA × SD interaction indicated that relatively high SD may improve FCR at older ages, but parallel increased mortality would pose concerns about the actual productive benefits and welfare. Combining large GS and relatively low SD seem to improve performance and decrease flock disturbance. They would also increase leg problems, and so their actual benefits on welfare remain unclear. A gradual increase in FCR seems to occur with longer DP at older EIA (EIA × DP interaction), highlighting the importance of adapting light programs to flock age to optimize performance. The SD × DP and GS × DP interactions predicted increased FCR for longer DP at low SD or large GS, that is, with more effective space available. Longer DP combined with low SD or large GS would overall promote enhanced leg conditions, and therefore welfare. Predictions would not support scotoperiod division from both performance and welfare perspectives. The SD × EC interaction indicated that EC would benefit chicken performance at low SD, although EC would seem to increase leg problems.

However, the role of NO in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is controversial because NO can increase in nitrosative stress while simultaneously possessing antiinflammatory properties. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that increased NO will lead to tumor suppression of CRPC through tumor microenvironment. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an NO donor, decreased the tumor burden in murine model of CRPC by targeting tumors in a cell nonautonomous manner. GSNO inhibited both the abundance of antiinflammatory () macrophages and expression of pERK, indicating that tumor-associated macrophages activity is influenced by NO. Additionally, GSNO decreased IL-34, indicating suppression of tumor-associated macrophage differentiation. Cytokine profiling of CRPC tumor grafts exposed to GSNO revealed a significant decrease in expression of G-CSF and M-CSF compared with grafts not exposed to GSNO. We verified the durability of NO on CRPC tumor suppression by using secondary xenograft murine models. This study validates the significance of NO on inhibition of CRPC tumors through tumor microenvironment (TME). These findings may facilitate the development of previously unidentified NO-based therapy for CRPC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29554212>Combined  encompassing intratumoral poly-ICLC, dendritic-cell vaccination and radiotherapy in advanced cancer patients.</a></h2><p>Combination  has the potential to achieve additive or synergistic effects.

Six patients received stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) on selected tumor lesions, including those injected with Hiltonol. Expression of 25 immune-relevant genes was sequentially monitored by RT-PCR on circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) and serum concentrations of a cytokine panel were sequentially determined before and during treatment.

One heavily pretreated castration-resistant prostate cancer patient experienced a remarkable mixed abscopal response to SABR+ . No objective responses were observed, while nine patients presented SD (five of them in the six-patient radiotherapy cohort). Intratumoral Hiltonol increased IFN-β and IFN-α mRNA in circulating PBMC. DC vaccination increased serum IL-12 and IL-1β concentrations, especially in patients presenting SD.

In the early 1990s, two different phenotypes of macrophages were described: one of them called classically activated (or inflammatory) macrophages (M1) and the other alternatively activated (or wound-healing) macrophages (). Currently, it is known that functional polarization of macrophages into only two groups is an over-simplified description of macrophage heterogeneity and plasticity; indeed, it is necessary to consider a continuum of functional states. Overall, the current available data indicate that macrophage polarization is a multifactorial process in which a huge number of factors can be involved producing different activation scenarios. Once a macrophage adopts a phenotype, it still retains the ability to continue changing in response to new environmental influences. The reversibility of polarization has a critical therapeutic value, especially in diseases in which an M1/ imbalance plays a pathogenic role.

To overcome these limitations, both the immune priming of antitumoral lymphocytes and the reprogramming of immunosuppressive factors in TMEs are essential. Here, we suggest a nanoemulsion (NE)-based immunotherapeutic platform that can not only modulate tumor-induced suppression but also induce an effective cell-mediated immune response for T cell proliferation. Multifunctional NEs can be fabricated by integrating the efficacy of NEs as delivery systems and the multifaceted immunomodulation characteristics (, immunostimulation and reprogramming of immunosuppression) of small molecule-based Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonists. Local  vaccination of melanoma and cervical tumor models with tumor antigens (protein and peptide) adjuvanted with NE loaded with TLR7/8 agonists [NE (TLR7/8a)] induced the recruitment and activation of innate immune cells, infiltration of lymphocytes, and polarization of tumor-associated  macrophages, which resulted in inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged survival in both primary and rechallenged tumor models. Antibody-depletion experiments also suggested that macrophages, type I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β), CD8 T cells, and NK1.1 cells contributed to the antitumor effect of NE (TLR7/8a).

In this study, we confirmed that the local and systemic immune profiles of an orthotopic osteosarcoma model with or without luciferase transfection were statistically equivalent. Next, we used flow cytometry to describe systemic immune cell populations influenced by osteosarcoma disease progression. When compared to vehicle-inoculated sham mice, it was found that tumor-bearing mice had significant immunophenotype disturbances at approximately 11 weeks after inoculation (at which time 90% of primary tumor-bearing mice have fulminant pulmonary metastases). Percent populations of natural killer cells and T regulatory cells were increased in the spleens of tumor-bearing mice ( < 0.0083) compared to shams. Additionally, T lymphocytes from spleens of tumor-bearing mice showed increased Tim-3/PD-1 exhaustion status ( < 0.0083). There were also increases in the percent populations of myeloid cells and overall M1/ macrophage marker expression on tumor-bearing mice spleens versus controls ( < 0.00714). Finally, treatment with 20 g -PD-L1 decreased T-cell exhaustion back to sham status, with a corresponding increase in CTLA-4 expression on cytotoxic T cells in the majority of mice tested. Checkpoint inhibition also increased splenic monocyte maturation and returned macrophage M1/ marker expression back to sham status. These data suggest that cancer induces systemic immune dysregulation and that these changes may be elucidated and utilized for treatment purposes by sampling the systemic immune environment via the spleen.

The presence of various immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment, especially tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), has been shown to be a driving force in tumor initiation and development. Reversion of the TAM phenotype is an effective way to induce a subsequent antitumor immune response. In this study, we developed baicalin-loaded poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles containing an antigenic peptide (Hgp 10025-33, Hgp) and a toll-like receptor 9 agonist (CpG). The nanoparticles were further coated with a galactose-inserted erythrocyte membrane, which actively targeted the TAMs. The TAM polarization and tumor treatment effectiveness of the nanoparticles were evaluated. The biomimetic nanoparticles showed enhanced cell uptake in vitro and targeted effects in vivo. In addition, compared with baicalin-loaded PLGA-NPs (B@NPs), the biomimetic nanoparticles, such as Hgp/B@NPs-CpG and NPs@RBC-Gala, significantly polarized the TAMs such that they changed from the  type to the M1 type both in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, the infiltration of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells into tumor sites after being induced by the biomimetic nanoparticles was greatly increased, which suggested a significant enhancement of the immune activation effect and T cell response. In addition, the activation of the T cells and induction of the CTL responses effectively suppressed melanoma tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, the biomimetic nanoparticles effectively reversed the TAM phenotype from  to M1, which further improved the tumor immune microenvironment and promoted tumor .

All patients were treated with R-CHOP, and no immunosuppression related cases were included. Tissue for nanoString gene expression was available in 141.High (i.e. adverse) LAR was associated with inferior progression free and overall survival (PFS 45% vs. 78%; OS 56% vs 86%, both p<0.001) at 5-years. Patients with a high LAR had a strikingly different TME compared to patients with a low ratio. Low LAR was associated with a good-risk TME immune gene signature (p<0.0001), including high CD8 and lower  macrophage infiltration. COO classification was not significantly different between high and low LAR patients. LAR was predictive of outcome independent of cell of origin and the international prognostic index (IPI). In particular, LAR discriminated patients with high IPI (3-5), showing 5-year PFS and OS of 32% vs. 74% (p=0.0006), and 43% vs. 81% (p=0.0003).

Further studies are required to determine if this easily applicable blood assay can determine patients that might benefit from immune checkpoint blockade.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30445446>A Molecular Targeted Immunotherapeutic Strategy for Ulcerative Colitis via Dual-targeting Nanoparticles Delivering miR-146b to Intestinal Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are a promising therapeutic target for intestinal mucosal repair. MiR-146b appears to control macrophage activation and cell proliferation.By loading miR-146b mimic on mannose-modified trimethyl chitosan [MTC]-conjugated nanoparticles [NPs] [MTC-miR146b], a molecular targeted immunotherapeutic approach was developed to selectively target intestinal macrophages for mucosal regeneration and tumourigenesis in mouse models.We first confirmed that miR-146b expression was significantly enhanced during mucosal regeneration in a murine colitis model. Moreover， after mucosal damage, MTC-miR146b mimic-treated wild-type mice had dramatically restored body weight and mucosal barrier function compared with MTC-NC treated mice. Strikingly, MTC-miR146b mimic oral administration protected miR-146b-deficient mice from dextran sodium sulphate [DSS] injury and the colitis-associated cancer process. Mechanistically, miR-146b strongly inhibited M1 macrophage activation by suppressing the Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4] signalling pathway, resulting in the repression of the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. More importantly, miR-146b overexpression in bone marrow-derived macrophages [BMDMs] in M1 differentiation conditions induced a phenotype similar to  macrophages and improved the proliferation of co-cultured colonic epithelial cells via STAT3-dependent IL-10 production.MTC-miR146b should be regarded as an effective candidate for oral delivery and could improve the efficacy of immunotherapies for ulcerative colitis and colitis-associated cancer.Copyright © 2018 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Oncolytic virotherapy that selectively infects and destroys cancer cells is a promising option for treating Ewing sarcoma. The effect of tumor macrophages on oncolytic virus therapy, however, is variable among solid tumors and is unknown in Ewing sarcoma. We tested the effects of macrophage reduction using liposomal clodronate (Clodrosome) and trabectedin on the antitumor efficacy of intratumoral oncolytic herpes simplex virus, rRp450, in two Ewing sarcoma xenograft models. Both agents enhanced antitumor efficacy without increasing virus replication. The most profound effects were in A673 with only a transient effect on response rates in TC71. Interestingly, A673 was more dependent than TC71 on macrophages for its tumorigenesis. We found Clodrosome and virus together induced expression of antitumorigenic genes and reduced expression of protumorigenic genes in both the tumor-associated macrophages and the overall tumor stroma. Trabectedin reduced intratumoral natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and -like macrophages, and prevented their increase following virotherapy. Our data suggest that a combination of trabectedin and oncolytic herpes virotherapy warrants testing in the clinical setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30307407>Osteopontin mediates glioblastoma-associated macrophage infiltration and is a potential therapeutic target.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma is highly enriched with macrophages, and osteopontin (OPN) expression levels correlate with glioma grade and the degree of macrophage infiltration; thus, we studied whether OPN plays a crucial role in immune modulation. Quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, and ELISA were used to determine OPN expression. Knockdown of OPN was achieved using complementary siRNA, shRNA, and CRISPR/Cas9 techniques, followed by a series of in vitro functional migration and immunological assays. OPN gene-deficient mice were used to examine the roles of non-tumor-derived OPN on survival of mice harboring intracranial gliomas. Patients with mesenchymal glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) show high OPN expression, a negative survival prognosticator. OPN is a potent chemokine for macrophages, and its blockade significantly impaired the ability of glioma cells to recruit macrophages. Integrin αvβ5 (ITGαvβ5) is highly expressed on glioblastoma-infiltrating macrophages and constitutes a major OPN receptor. OPN maintains the  macrophage gene signature and phenotype. Both tumor-derived and host-derived OPN were critical for glioma development. OPN deficiency in either innate immune or glioma cells resulted in a marked reduction in  macrophages and elevated T cell effector activity infiltrating the glioma. Furthermore, OPN deficiency in the glioma cells sensitized them to direct CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. Systemic administration in mice of 4-1BB-OPN bispecific aptamers was efficacious, increasing median survival time by 68% (P < 0.05). OPN is thus an important chemokine for recruiting macrophages to glioblastoma, mediates crosstalk between tumor cells and the innate immune system, and has the potential to be exploited as a therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30892966>Cardiotrophin-1 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine and promotes IL-4-induced  macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Macrophages play a central role in tissue remodeling, repair, and resolution of inflammation. Macrophage polarization to M1 or  activation status may determine the progression or resolution of the inflammatory response. We have previously reported that cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) displays both cytoprotective and metabolic activities. The role of CT-1 in inflammation remains poorly understood. Here, we employed recombinant CT-1 (rCT-1) and used -null mice and myeloid-specific  transgenic mice to investigate whether CT-1 might play a role in the modulation of the inflammatory response. We observed that  deficiency was associated with enhanced release of inflammatory mediators and with stronger activation of NF-κB in response to LPS, whereas the inflammatory response was attenuated in  transgenic mice or by administering rCT-1 to wild-type animals prior to LPS challenge. We found that CT-1 promoted IL-6 expression only by nonhematopoietic cells, whereas LPS up-regulated IL-6 expression in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. Notably, rCT-1 inhibited LPS-mediated soluble IL-6R induction. Using  mice, we showed that rCT-1 inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α and IFN-γ response in an IL-6-independent manner. Importantly, we demonstrated that CT-1 primes macrophages for IL-4-dependent  polarization by inducing IL-4 receptor expression. Mechanistic analyses showed that the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 axis mediates this effect. Our findings support the notion that CT-1 is a critical regulator of inflammation and suggest that rCT-1 could be a molecule with potential therapeutic application in inflammatory conditions.-Carneros, D., Santamaría, E.

B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a rational target in multiple myeloma (MM).We conducted a phase I study of autologous T cells lentivirally-transduced with a fully-human, BCMA-specific CAR containing CD3ζ and 4-1BB signaling domains (CART-BCMA), in subjects with relapsed/refractory MM. Twenty-five subjects were treated in 3 cohorts: 1) 1-5 x 108 CART-BCMA cells alone; 2) Cyclophosphamide (Cy) 1.5 g/ + 1-5 x 107 CART-BCMA cells; and 3) Cy 1.5 g/ + 1-5 x 108 CART-BCMA cells. No pre-specified BCMA expression level was required.CART-BCMA cells were manufactured and expanded in all subjects. Toxicities included cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, which were grade 3-4 in 8 (32%) and 3 (12%) subjects, respectively, and reversible. One subject died at day 24 from candidemia and progressive myeloma, following treatment for severe CRS and encephalopathy. Responses (based on treated subjects) were seen in 4/9 (44%) in cohort 1, 1/5 (20%) in cohort 2, and 7/11 (64%) in cohort 3, including 5 partial, 5 very good partial, and 2 complete responses, 3 of which were ongoing at 11, 14, and 32 months. Decreased BCMA expression on residual MM cells was noted in responders; expression increased at progression in most. Responses and CART-BCMA expansion were associated with CD4:CD8 T cell ratio and frequency of CD45RO-CD27+CD8+ T cells in the pre-manufacturing leukapheresis product.CART-BCMA infusions with or without lymphodepleting chemotherapy are clinically active in heavily-pretreated MM patients..University of Pennsylvania-Novartis Alliance and NIH.</p></html>
