Our understanding of the regulation and function of these organelles is of great interest to scientists and clinicians across many disciplines within our healthcare system. Skeletal muscle is a useful model tissue for the study of mitochondrial adaptations because of its mass and contribution to whole body . The remarkable plasticity of mitochondria allows them to adjust their volume, structure, and capacity under conditions such as exercise, which is useful or improving  health in individuals with various diseases and/or advancing age. Mitochondria exist within muscle as a functional reticulum which is maintained by dynamic processes of biogenesis and fusion, and is balanced by opposing processes of fission and mitophagy. The sophisticated coordination of these events is incompletely understood, but is imperative for organelle function and essential for the maintenance of an interconnected organelle network that is finely tuned to the  needs of the cell. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of mitochondrial turnover in muscle could offer potential therapeutic targets for the advancement of health and longevity among our aging populations. As well, investigating exercise modalities that are both convenient and capable of inducing robust mitochondrial adaptations are useful in fostering more widespread global adherence. To this point, exercise remains the most potent behavioural therapeutic approach for the improvement of mitochondrial health, not only in muscle, but potentially also in other tissues.

Additionally, local  by enzymes preferentially or exclusively occurring in the lung is important for favorable or toxic effects of xenobiotics entering the organism also by routes other than by inhalation. The data collected in this review show that generally activities of cytochromes P450 are low in the lung of all investigated species and in vitro models. Other oxidoreductases may turn out to be more important, but are largely not investigated. Phase II enzymes are generally much higher with the exception of UGT glucuronosyltransferases which are generally very low. Insofar as data are available the xenobiotic  in the lung of monkeys comes closed to that in the human lung; however, very few data are available for this comparison. Second best rate the mouse and rat lung, followed by the rabbit. Of the human in vitro model primary cells in culture, such as alveolar macrophages and alveolar type II cells as well as the A549 cell line appear quite acceptable. However, (1) this generalization represents a temporary oversimplification born from the lack of more comparable data; (2) the relative suitability of individual species/models is different for different enzymes; (3) when more data become available, the conclusions derived from these comparisons quite possibly may change.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671132>MitoToxy assay: A novel cell-based method for the assessment of  toxicity in a multiwell plate format using a lactate FRET nanosensor, Laconic.</a></h1><p>Mitochondrial toxicity is a primary source of pre-clinical drug attrition, black box warning and post-market drug withdrawal. Methods that detect mitochondrial toxicity as early as possible during the drug development process are required. Here we introduce a new method for detecting mitochondrial toxicity based on MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing the genetically encoded FRET lactate indicator, Laconic. The method takes advantage of the high cytosolic lactate accumulation observed during mitochondrial stress, regardless of the specific toxicity mechanism, explained by compensatory glycolytic activation. Using a standard multi-well plate reader, dose-response curve experiments allowed the sensitivity of the methodology to detect  toxicity induced by classical mitochondrial toxicants. Suitability for high-throughput screening applications was evaluated resulting in a Z'-factor > 0.5 and CV% < 20 inter-assay variability. A pilot screening allowed sensitive detection of commercial drugs that were previously withdrawn from the market due to liver/cardiac toxicity issues, such as camptothecin, ciglitazone, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and terfenadine, in ten minutes. We envisage that the availability of this technology, based on a fluorescent genetically encoded indicator, will allow direct assessment of mitochondrial , and will make the early detection of mitochondrial toxicity in the drug development process possible, saving time and resources.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671668>PFKFB3 Inhibition Attenuates Oxaliplatin-Induced Autophagy and Enhances Its Cytotoxicity in Colon Cancer Cells.</a></h1><p>6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase isoform 3 (PFKFB3), a glycolytic enzyme highly expressed in cancer cells, has been reported to participate in regulating , angiogenesis, and autophagy. Although anti-cancer drug oxaliplatin (Oxa) effectively inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, the growing resistance and side-effects make it urgent to improve the therapeutic strategy of Oxa. Although Oxa induces the autophagy process, the role of PFKFB3 in this process remains unknown. In addition, whether PFKFB3 affects the cytotoxicity of Oxa has not been investigated. Here, we show that Oxa-inhibited cell proliferation and migration concomitant with the induction of apoptosis and autophagy in SW480 cells. Both inhibition of autophagy by small molecule inhibitors and siRNA modification decreased the cell viability loss and apoptosis induced by Oxa. Utilizing quantitative PCR and immunoblotting, we observed that Oxa increased PFKFB3 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, suppression of PFKFB3 attenuated both the basal and Oxa-induced autophagy, by monitoring the autophagic flux and phosphorylated-Ulk1, which play essential roles in autophagy initiation. Moreover, PFKFB3 inhibition further inhibited the cell proliferation/migration, and cell viability decreased by Oxa. Collectively, the presented data demonstrated that PFKFB3 inhibition attenuated Oxa-induced autophagy and enhanced its cytotoxicity in colorectal cancer cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671697>Why Bile Acids Are So Important in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Progression.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex disease, affecting not just the liver, but also all other organs in the body. Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the liver-gut axis and especially the role of bile acids in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease inflammation and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile acid  and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials. With the complexity of the issue, we did not aim at giving a complete review, rather highlighting important targets and potential treatments that could be approved for NAFLD/NASH treatment within the next few years.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670946>X-ray spectroscopy fostering the understanding of foliar uptake and transport of Mn by soybean (Glycine max L. Merril): Kinetics, chemical speciation and effects of glyphosate.</a></h1><p>Increasing soybean yield is a humankind challenge dependent on several management practices, such as fertilizing and weed control. While glyphosate contributes to controlling weeds, it can interfere with spray mixtures stability and, supposedly, complexing with micronutrients within the plant tissue. This study investigated the effects of glyphosate on soybean foliar uptake and transport of Mn supplied as MnSO4, MnHPO3, Mn-EDTA, and MnCO3. Those fertilizers induced ultrastructural changes on the leaf cuticle, regardless of glyphosate mixture. Except for MnCO3, all tested sources increased Mn content in the petiole. The mixture of glyphosate impaired Mn transport from MnSO4 and MnHPO3, but no evidence of Mn-glyphosate complexation within the plant was found. Manganese is rather transported in a similar chemical environment regardless of the source, except for Mn-EDTA, which was absorbed and transported in its pristine form. Interferences of glyphosate seem related to complexations in the tank mixture rather than affecting nutrients' .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672943>TFEB activation in macrophages attenuates postmyocardial infarction ventricular dysfunction independently of ATG5-mediated autophagy.</a></h1><p>Lysosomes are at the epicenter of cellular processes critical for inflammasome activation in macrophages. Inflammasome activation and IL-1Î² secretion are implicated in myocardial infarction (MI) and resultant heart failure; however, little is known about how macrophage lysosomes regulate these processes. In mice subjected to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and humans with ischemic cardiomyopathy, we observed evidence of lysosomal impairment in macrophages. Inducible macrophage-specific overexpression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis (MÏ-TFEB), attenuated postinfarction remodeling, decreased abundance of proinflammatory macrophages, and reduced levels of myocardial IL-1Î² compared with controls. Surprisingly, neither inflammasome suppression nor MÏ-TFEB-mediated attenuation of postinfarction myocardial dysfunction required intact ATG5-dependent macroautophagy (hereafter termed "autophagy"). RNA-seq of flow-sorted macrophages postinfarction revealed that MÏ-TFEB upregulated key targets involved in lysosomal lipid . Specifically, inhibition of the TFEB target, lysosomal acid lipase, in vivo abrogated the beneficial effect of MÏ-TFEB on postinfarction ventricular function. Thus, TFEB reprograms macrophage lysosomal lipid  to attenuate remodeling after IR, suggesting an alternative paradigm whereby lysosome function affects inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672758>Relationship of obstructive sleep apnoea severity and subclinical systemic atherosclerosis.</a></h1><p>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common form of sleep-disordered breathing. Untreated OSA might accelerate atherosclerosis, potentially increasing the cardiovascular disease burden in patients. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between objectively measured OSA severity and the presence of subclinical systemic atherosclerosis using non-invasive measurements, including tomographic quantification of the calcium burden.A total of 2157 participants of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, who were free of structural heart disease and underwent both in-home polysomnography and chest computed tomography, were cross-sectionally analysed. Participants were divided into three groups based on the severity of OSA: no OSA (apnoea-hypopnea index [AHI]<5, n=1096), mild OSA (5â¤AHI<15, n=700), and moderate-to-severe OSA (AHIâ¥15, n=361). Calcium deposits in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries were measured by the Agatston score.Participants with moderate-to-severe OSA were 1.6 times (95% CI=1.18-2.15, p=0.002) more likely to have ascending thoracic aorta calcification (aTACâ¥100 units) than those without OSA, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the association between moderate-to-severe OSA and aTAC of subjects with higher epicardial fat volume (EFV) was slightly stronger than that in patients without OSA and lower EFV tertile (OR=2.11; 95% CI=1.30-3.43).Severity of OSA in the general population was independently associated with subclinical systemic atherosclerosis. These findings highlight the potential importance of severe OSA, especially in subjects with higher epicardial fat, as a possible predictive factor for systemic atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.Copyright Â©ERS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670603>Naringenin Increases Insulin Sensitivity and  Rate: A Case Study.</a></h1><p>Our studies in primary human adipocytes show that naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, increases oxygen consumption rate and gene expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), glucose transporter type 4, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on  rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150âmg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting  rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by 2.3âkg. The  rate peaked at 3.5% above baseline at 1âh, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline, insulin decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces body weight and insulin resistance, and increases  rate by PPAR and PPAR activation. The effects of naringenin on energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity warrant investigation in a randomized controlled clinical trial.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673493>Body Weight Misperception and Psychological Distress Among Children and Adolescents: The CASPIAN-V Study.</a></h1><p>Misperception of weight status is a risk factor that affects psychological health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between weight misperception patterns and psychological distress among Iranian children and adolescents.This was a cross-sectional nationwide study where data was collected from 14,440 students, aged 7-18 years who participated in the national school-based surveillance program (CASPIAN-V). The students' weight perception and psychological distress were assessed by validated questionnaires. Weight misperception was classified as misperception of being either underweight or overweight with respect to actual weight.The rate of weight misperception in all study participants was 59.1%. In groups with a perception of being underweight or overweight, the risks of worthlessness, being worried, experiencing aggression, insomnia, or depression, were significantly higher than groups with an accurate weight perception ( < 0.05). The risk of anxiety in girls of normal weight who perceived themselves as underweight, decreased by 57% compared to girls with an accurate weight perception (OR: 0.43; 95% CI, 0.28-0.66).Weight misperception is highly prevalent among Iranian children and adolescents and is associated with their psychological health status. Appropriate education intervention needs to be developed to improve the children and adolescents' perception of their body weight status.Copyright Â©2019, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672941>Athletes feature greater rates of muscle glucose transport and glycogen synthesis during lipid infusion.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUNDInsulin resistance results from impaired skeletal muscle glucose transport/phosphorylation, linked to augmented lipid availability. Despite greater intramuscular lipids, athletes are highly insulin sensitive, which could result from higher rates of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis or glucose transport/phosphorylation and oxidation. Thus, we examined the time course of muscle glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations during low and high systemic lipid availability.METHODSEight endurance-trained and 9 sedentary humans (VO2 peak: 56 Â± 2 vs. 33 Â± 2 mL/kg/min, P < 0.05) underwent 6-hour hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp tests with infusions of triglycerides or saline in a randomized crossover design. Glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations were monitored in vastus lateralis muscles using 13C/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.RESULTSAthletes displayed a 25% greater (P < 0.05) insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate (Rd) than sedentary participants. During Intralipid infusion, insulin sensitivity remained higher in the athletes (ÎRd: 25 Â± 3 vs. 17 Â± 3 Î¼mol/kg/min, P < 0.05), supported by higher glucose transporter type 4 protein expression than in sedentary humans. Compared to saline infusion, AUC of glucose-6-phosphate remained unchanged during Intralipid infusion in athletes (1.6 Â± 0.2 mmol/L vs. 1.4 Â± 0.2 [mmol/L] Ã h, P = n.s.) but tended to decrease by 36% in sedentary humans (1.7 Â± 0.4 vs. 1.1 Â± 0.1 [mmol/L] Ã h, P < 0.059). This drop was accompanied by a 72% higher rate of net glycogen synthesis in the athletes upon Intralipid infusion (47 Â± 9 vs. 13 Â± 3 Î¼mol/kg/min, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONAthletes feature higher skeletal muscle glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis during increased lipid availability, which primarily results from maintained insulin-stimulated glucose transport with increased myocellular glucose-6-phosphate levels for subsequent glycogen synthesis.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov .FUNDINGGerman Federal Ministry of Health (BMG).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669636>RNA-Seq comparative analysis reveals the response of Enterococcus faecalis TV4 under fluoride exposure.</a></h1><p>Enterococcus faecalis is one of the main components of symbiotic bacteria in the intestine of silkworm (Bombyx mori L.). The abundance of E. faecalis in the intestine of silkworm is affected by fluoride exposure. However, the response mechanism of E. faecalis toward fluoride remains largely unknown. In this study, a strain of E. faecalis (named TV4), which is a symbiotic bacteria of silkworm, was isolated and characterized. Inhibition assay showed that fluoride could significantly inhibit the growth of the TV4 strain (P<0.05) after culture for 4 h. Finally, Illumina X-Ten platform was used to investigate the response mechanism of E. faecalis TV4 under fluoride exposure. We found that the TV4 strain demonstrated significant changes in its carbohydrate transport and  and energy . The transcriptome sequencing results revealed that 237 genes were differentially expressed for TV4 grown after fluoride exposure, i.e., 92 genes were differentially up-regulated and 145 genes were differentially down-regulated. Many of the down-regulated genes were involved in cell carbohydrate transport and  and energy production, whereas the up-regulated genes were mostly related to ethanolamine utilization and amino acid synthesis and . Our results revealed that strain TV4 reduced its carbohydrate  and energy  and increased ethanolamine utilization and amino acid  to adapt and survive under fluoride exposure. This study enhances our understanding about the response mechanism of E. faecalis after fluoride exposure and has important implications for investigations on the three-way interaction among fluoride, symbiotic bacteria and silkworm.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the maintenance of duplicated genes and their relevance to adaptive evolution has long been debated. Insect trehalase (Treh) plays key roles in energy , growth, and stress recovery. Here, we show that the duplication of Treh in Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) is linked with their adaptation to various environmental stresses. Generally, two Treh genes are present in insects: Treh1 and Treh2. We report three distinct forms of Treh in lepidopteran insects, where Treh1 was duplicated into two gene clusters (Treh1a and Treh1b). These gene clusters differ in gene expression patterns, enzymatic properties, and subcellular localizations, suggesting that the enzymes probably underwent sub and/or neo-functionalization in the lepidopteran insects. Interestingly, selective pressure analysis provided significant evidence of positive selection on duplicate Treh1b gene in lepidopteran insect lineages. Most positively selected sites were located in the alpha-helical region, and several sites were close to the trehalose binding and catalytic sites. Subcellular adaptation of duplicate Treh1b driven by positive selection appears to have occurred as a result of selected changes in specific sequences, allowing for rapid reprogramming of duplicated Treh during evolution. Our results suggest that gene duplication of Treh and subsequent functional diversification could increase the survival rate of lepidopteran insects through various regulations of intracellular trehalose levels, facilitating their adaptation to diverse habitats. This study provides evidence regarding the mechanism by which gene family expansion can contribute to species adaptation through gene duplication and subsequent functional diversification.Â© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675419>Impaired Glucose  in Primary Aldosteronism Is Associated With Cortisol Cosecretion.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671694>Effects of the Essential Oil from  Var.  on the Lateral Line System and the Gene Expression Profile of Zebrafish ().</a></h1><p>Mastic essential oil exhibits anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties.

In humans, the importance of this effect has remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close relatives is both rare and frequently associated with confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding coefficients (F) for >1.4 million individuals, we show that F is significantly associated (pâ<â0.0005) with apparently deleterious changes in 32 out of 100 traits analysed. These changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly rare. The effect on fertility is striking: F equivalent to the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55% decrease [95% CI 44-66%] in the odds of having children. Finally, the effects of F are confirmed within full-sibling pairs, where the variation in F is independent of all environmental confounding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674699>Biochemical study of the effect of stress conditions on the mandelonitrile-associated salicylic acid biosynthesis in peach.</a></h1><p>Salicylic acid (SA) plays a central role in plant responses to environmental stresses. In a recent study, we suggested a third pathway for SA biosynthesis from mandelonitrile (MD) in peach plants. This pathway is alternative to the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase pathway and links SA biosynthesis and cyanogenesis. In the present work, by biochemical approaches, we studied the effect of salt stress and Plum pox virus (PPV) infection on this proposed SA biosynthetic pathway from MD. Peach plants were submitted to salt stress and Plum pox virus (PPV) infection. We studied the levels of SA and its intermediates/precursors (Phe, MD, amygdalin and benzoic acid) in in vitro shoots. Moreover, in peach seedlings we analyzed the content of H2O2-related enzymes, SA and the stress-related hormones abscisic acid and jasmonic acid. We showed that the contribution of this SA biosynthetic pathway from MD to the total SA pool does not seem to be important under the stress conditions assayed. Nevertheless, MD treatment not only affected the SA content, but it also had a pleiotropic effect on abscisic acid and jasmonic acid levels. Furthermore, MD modulates the antioxidative  via SA-dependent or -independent redox-related signaling . Even thought that the proposed SA biosynthetic pathway seems to be functional under stress conditions, MD, and hence CNglcs, may be operating more broadly than by influencing SA  and signaling. Thus, the physiological function of the proposed SA biosynthetic pathway remains to be elucidated.Â© 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672571>Loss of the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin leads to decreased glutathione synthesis.</a></h1><p>Previous studies demonstrated that loss of CL in the yeast mutant crd1Î leads to perturbation of mitochondrial ironâsulfur (FeS) cluster biogenesis, resulting in decreased activity of mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe-S-requiring enzymes, including aconitase and sulfite reductase.

Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) is a key regulator of centriole biogenesis. How Plk4 dynamically promotes its symmetry-breaking relocalization and achieves its procentriole-assembly state remains unknown. Here we show that Plk4 is a unique kinase that utilizes its autophosphorylated noncatalytic cryptic polo-box (CPB) to phase separate and generate a nanoscale spherical condensate. Analyses of the crystal structure of a phospho-mimicking, condensation-proficient CPB mutant reveal that a disordered loop at the CPB PB2-tip region is critically required for Plk4 to generate condensates and induce procentriole assembly. CPB phosphorylation also promotes Plk4's dissociation from the Cep152 tether while binding to downstream STIL, thus allowing Plk4 condensate to serve as an assembling body for centriole biogenesis.

We then mapped over 10,000 public transcriptomic or cistromic experiments to their pathway node or biosample of study. To enable prediction of pathway node-geneÂ target transcriptional regulatory relationships through SPP, we generated consensus 'omics signatures, or consensomes, which ranked genes based on measures of their significant differential expression or promoter occupancy across transcriptomic or cistromic experiments mapped to a specific node family. Consensomes were validated using alignment with canonical literature knowledge, geneÂ target-level integration of transcriptomic and cistromic data points, and in bench experiments confirming previously uncharacterized node-gene target regulatory relationships. To expose the SPP knowledgebase to researchers, a web browser interface was designed that accommodates numerous routine data mining strategies.

However, microbial production of some compounds like aromatic amino acid (AAA)-derived chemicals, remains an outstanding  engineering challenge. Here we present the construction of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae platform strain able to produce high levels of p-coumaric acid, an AAA-derived precursor for many commercially valuable chemicals. This is achieved through engineering the AAA biosynthesis pathway, introducing a phosphoketalose-based pathway to divert glycolytic flux towards erythrose 4-phosphate formation, and optimizing carbon distribution between glycolysis and the AAA biosynthesis pathway by replacing the promoters of several important genes at key nodes between these two . This results in a maximum p-coumaric acid titer of 12.5âgâL and a maximum yield on glucose of 154.9âmgâg.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671256>Open Systems Pharmacology community - an open access, open source, open science approach to modeling and simulation in pharmaceutical sciences.</a></h1><p>Systems Pharmacology integrates structural biological and pharmacological knowledge and experimental data enabling dissection of organism and drug properties and providing excellent predictivity.

Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are the cornerstone in the management of schizophrenia. However, despite their efficacy in counteracting both positive and negative symptomatology of schizophrenia, recent clinical observations have described an increase in the prevalence of  disturbances in patients treated with SGAs, including abnormal weight gain, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. While the molecular mechanisms responsible for these side-effects remain poorly understood, increasing evidence points to a link between SGAs and adipose tissue depots of white, brown and beige adipocytes. In this review, we survey the present knowledge in this area, with a particular focus on the molecular aspects of adipocyte biology including differentiation, lipid , thermogenic function and the browning/beiging process.Copyright Â© 2019.

Despite the growing number of apps on the topic "diabetes & pregnancy", a smartphone app offering comprehensive and individualized information to both women (before and during gestation) and their healthcare professionals was still missing. To overcome this lack, the Italian Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group conceived and realized in 2016 a novel mobile app called "MySweetGestation". It is designed to be an interactive educational tool for both patients and physicians not expert in the field. Through an interactive way of learning, it provides validated information to the user, focusing on different area of interest: from prevention and risk factors for developing diabetes during pregnancy to treatment and follow-up strategies after gestation. Three years since its publication, MySweetGestation has been downloaded in different western and eastern countries worldwide, suggesting a widespread social impact. Easily accessible personalized information made available via mHealth technology may be of great importance to spread controlled information among the pregnant population. MySweetGestation, being an interactive educational device for both patients and healthcare professionals, may contribute to improve the management of pregnant women with diabetes.Copyright Â© 2019.

Thus, it might be a good strategy to decrease oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial changes in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we investigate the role of the most biologically active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) in oxidative stress and mitochondrial changes in tertiary butyl-hydrogen (tBHP)-treated C2C12 muscle cells. Differentiated C2C12 muscle cells were pretreated with tBHP, followed by 1,25(OH)2D for additional 24 h. An exogenous inducer of oxidative stress, tBHP significantly increased oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, intracellular damage, and cell death which were reversed by 1,25(OH)2D in C2C12 myotubes. 1.25(OH)2D improves tBHP-induced mitochondrial morphological changes such as swelling, irregular cristae, and smaller size and number, as observed by transmission electron microscope. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D treatment increases mtDNA contents as well as gene expression involved in mitochondrial biogenesis such as PGC1Î±, NRF1, and Tfam. Significant increments in mRNA levels related to antioxidant enzymes such as Nrf2, HMOX1, and TXNRD1, myogenic differentiation markers including myoglobin, muscle creatine kinase (MCK), and MHCÐ and ÐÐ, and vitamin D  such as CYP24, CYP27, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) were found in 1,25(OH)2D-treated myotubes. Moreover, upon t-BHP-induced oxidative stress, significant incremental changes in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels, activities of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/sirtulin 1 (SIRT1), and SIRT1 expression were noted in 1,25(OH)2D-treated C2C12 muscle cells. Taken together, these results suggest the observed potent inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)2D on muscle oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics might be at least involved in the activation of AMPK and SIRT1 activation in muscle cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674689>Akkermansia muciniphila reduces Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced inflammation and periodontal bone destruction.</a></h1><p>Akkermansia muciniphila is a beneficial gut commensal, whose anti-inflammatory properties have recently been demonstrated. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of A.muciniphila on Porphyromonas gingivalis elicited inflammation.In lean and obese mice, A.muciniphila was administered in P.gingivalis induced calvarial abcess and in experimental periodontitis model (EIP). Bone destruction and inflammation were evaluated by histomorphometric analysis. In vitro, A.muciniphila was co-cultured with P.gingivalis, growth and virulence factors expression were evaluated. Bone-marrow macrophages (BMMÏ) and gingival epithelial cells (TIGK) were exposed to both bacterial strains and the expression of inflammatory mediators, as well as tight junction markers was analyzed.In a model of calvarial infection, A.muciniphila decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and bone destruction. In EIP, treatment with A.muciniphila resulted in a decreased alveolar bone loss. In vitro, the addition of A.muciniphila to P.gingivalis infected BMMÏ increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 and decreased IL-12. Additionally, A.muciniphila exposure increases the expression of junctional integrity markers such as integrin-Î²1, E-cadherin and ZO-1 in TIGK cells. A.muciniphila co-culture with P.gingivalis reduced gingipains mRNA expression.This study demonstrated the protective effects of A.muciniphila administration and may open consideration to its use as an adjunctive therapeutic agent to periodontal treatment.Â© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We also performed a human study using bone marrow (BM) aspirates, directly reflecting the bone microenvironment, in addition to  experiments. Peripheral blood and BM samples were simultaneously collected from 74 patients 65 years or older at hip surgery for either HF ( = 28) or for other causes ( = 46). Ceramides were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Age was correlated positively with circulating C16:0, C18:0, and C24:1 ceramide levels. Patients with fragility HF had 21.3%, 49.5%, 34.3%, and 22.5% higher plasma C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, and C24:1 ceramide levels, respectively, than those without HF. Higher C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, and C24:1 ceramide levels were positively related to bone resorption markers in both blood and BM samples. Furthermore,  studies showed that C18:0 and C24:1 ceramides directly increased osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption, and expression levels of osteoclast differentiation markers. These results suggested that the association of increased ceramides, especially C18:0 and C24:1, with adverse bone phenotypes in elderly people could be explained mainly by the increase in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669948>CO treatment improves the hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant properties of fenugreek seeds.</a></h1><p>A high level of serum cholesterol is a major cause of atherosclerosis. Fenugreek is a well-known hypocholesterolaemic agent with amazing phytochemical composition. Due to its impact on plant , CO enrichment was tested as a strategy to support functional values in fenugreek seeds. Phytochemical composition and biological activities of three fenugreek cultivars (G2, G6 and G30) grown under ambient (aCO, 400â¯Î¼molâ¯mol) and elevated CO (eCO, 620â¯Î¼molâ¯mol) were assessed. Applying eCO improved physical parameters of fenugreek seeds, and enhanced their biological activities. A significant increase in hypocholesterolaemic potential, as indicated by inhibition of cholesterol micellar solubility and pancreatic lipase activity, was recorded. In addition, antioxidant, anti-lipid peroxidation and antibacterial activities were improved. These enhanced biological activities were accompanied by improved seed chemical composition at the primary and secondary  levels. Therefore, eCO treatment represents an efficient strategy to increase the hypocholesterolaemic, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of fenugreek seeds.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Laboratory measurements included lipids (total cholesterol [TC]; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; and triglycerides) and markers of bone  (alkaline phosphatase; 25-hydroxyvitamin D; osteocalcin; and parathyroid hormone [PTH]); measurements were taken at baseline, Week 18, and Month 12, and analyzed according to enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) use at baseline (+EIAED and -EIAED subgroups).Data from 337 treatment-compliant patients were used for the Week 18 analyses (+EIAED subgroup, nâ¯=â¯119; -EIAED subgroup, nâ¯=â¯218); data from 161 treatment-compliant patients were used for the Month 12 analyses (+EIAED subgroup, nâ¯=â¯53; -EIAED subgroup, nâ¯=â¯108). At baseline, alkaline phosphatase and PTH concentrations were higher in theâ¯+â¯EIAED versus -EIAED subgroup. Changes from baseline in markers of bone turnover were generally insignificant, except for some elevation in alkaline phosphatase in the -EIAED subgroup (18 weeks and 12 months) and osteocalcin in both subgroups (18 weeks only). Regarding lipids, TC and HDL-C concentrations were higher in theâ¯+â¯EIAED versus -EIAED subgroup at baseline. Concentrations of markers of lipid  fell in theâ¯+â¯EIAED group and rose in the -EIAED group, reaching very similar values that were intermediate between the -EIAED andâ¯+â¯EIAED baseline values.Based on this retrospective analysis, ESL seems to have had only a modest and primarily clinically insignificant impact on plasma lipids.

We have recently shown 30-d exposure to increased inspired CO (InCO) leads to a steady-state ventilation that exceeds the level predicted by the sustained acidosis and the acute CO/H chemoreflex, suggesting plasticity within respiratory control centers. Based on data showing brainstem changes in aminergic and inflammatory signaling during carotid body denervation-induced hypercapnia, we hypothesized chronic hypercapnia  will lead to similar changes. We found that: ) increased InCO increased IL-1Î² in the medullary raphe (MR), ventral respiratory column, and cuneate nucleus after 24 h, but not after 30 d of hypercapnia; ) the number of serotonergic and total neurons were reduced within the MR and ventrolateral medulla following 30 d of increased InCO; ) markers of tryptophan  were altered following 24 h, but not 30 d of InCO; and ) there were few changes in brainstem amine levels following 24 h or 30 d of increased InCO. We conclude that these changes may contribute to initiating or maintaining respiratory neuroplasticity during chronic hypercapnia but alone do not account for ventilatory acclimatization to chronic increased InCO.-Burgraff, N.

In this study, the expression of miR133a and miR133b in murine BMSCs was inhibited via antagomiR-133a/b and the osteogenic differentiation in murine BMSCs was evaluated. The RT-PCR, flow cytometry, cell counting kit-8, and annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assays were performed. Double knockdown miR133a and miR133b can promote BMSC osteogenic differentiation. At optimum N/P ration (15:1), the loading efficiency can reach over 90%. CTH-antagomiR-133a/b showed no cytotoxicity to BMSCs and diminished miR133a and miR133b expression in BMSCs. Furthermore, chitosan-based sustained delivery system can continuous dose CTH-antagomiR-133a/b and calcium deposition and osteogenic specific gene expression were enhanced in vitro.

Therefore, methods to recover these reservoirs efficiently are of importance to guarantee energy supply. Here we report our novel stimulation of indigenous microbes by optimizing the water cut in low permeability reservoirs for green and enhanced oil recovery. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of indigenous bacterial communities with changes in water cut in reservoirs by high-throughput sequencing technology, and reveal the mechanism and characteristics of the crude oil biotreatment under different crude oil-water ratio conditions and the optimum activation time of indigenous functional microbial groups in reservoirs. The indigenous microbial  products were characterized by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Results showed that Acinetobacter (47.1%) and Pseudomones (19.8%) were the main functional genus of crude oil degradation at the optimal activation time, and can reduce the viscosity of crude oil from 8.33 to 5.75 mPaÂ·s. The dominant bacteria genus for oil recovery after activation of the production fluids was similar to those in the reservoirs with water cut of 60-80%. Furthermore seven mechanism  of enhancing oil recovery by the synergistic of functional microbial groups and their metabolites under different water cut conditions in low permeability reservoirs have been established.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671257>A citrulline based translational population system toxicology model for gastrointestinal related adverse events associated with anti-cancer treatments.</a></h1><p>Gastrointestinal (GI) related adverse events (AEs) are commonly observed in the clinic during cancer treatments. Citrulline is a potentially translatable biomarker of GI AEs. In this study, irinotecan induced citrulline changes were studied over a range of doses and schedules in rats. A translational system toxicology model for GI AEs using citrulline was then developed based on new experimental data and parameters from a literature intestinal cell dynamic model. With the addition of feedback and tolerance development mechanisms, the model well captured the plasma citrulline profiles after irinotecan treatment in rats. Subsequently, the model was translated to humans and predicted the observed GI AE dynamics in humans including dose scheduling effect using the cytotoxic and feedback parameters estimated in rats with slight calibrations. This translational toxicology model could be used for other anti-neoplastic drugs to simulate various clinical dosing scenarios before human studies and mitigate potential GI AEs.Â© 2019 The Authors CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675219>Hepatic metabolomic and transcriptomic responses induced by cecal infusion of sodium propionate in a fistula pig model.</a></h1><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the major products of the microbial fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates. SCFAs are known to improve host  but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL, 2 mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid  related stearic acid and glycerol-2-phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic acid, fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic acid; and decreased levels of the amino acid  products aspartic acid and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited fatty acid synthesis and promoted lipid  process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased glycolysis.

In the present study, we show that tau can accumulate spontaneously in aged transgenic APP/PS1 mice. Tau pathology is abundant around AÎ² deposits, and further characterized by accumulation of Gallyas and thioflavin-S-positive inclusions, which were detected in the APP/PS1 brain at 18 months of age. Age-dependent increases in argyrophilia correlated positively with binding levels of the paired helical filament (PHF) tracer [F]Flortaucipir, in all brain areas examined. Sarkosyl-insoluble PHFs were visualized by electron microscopy. Quantitative proteomics identified sequences of hyperphosphorylated and three-repeat tau in transgenic mice, along with signs of RNA missplicing, ribosomal dysregulation and disturbed energy . Tissue from the frontal gyrus of human subjects was used to validate these findings, revealing primarily quantitative differences between the tau pathology observed in AD patient vs. transgenic mouse tissue. As physiological levels of endogenous, 'wild-type' tau aggregate secondarily to AÎ² in APP/PS1 mice, this study suggests that amyloidosis is both necessary and sufficient to drive tauopathy in experimental models of familial AD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673536>Perioperative characteristics and management of liver transplantation for isolated methylmalonic acidemia-the largest experience in China.</a></h1><p>There are few detailed consensus and guidelines on perioperative clinical characteristics of liver transplantation (LT) in patients with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA).

All the patients received strict postoperative management.All the 7 cases were confirmed to have isolated MMA, among which, 3 cases received living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), 4 cases received deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). A wild fluctuate of  condition was observed within the first few days after surgery and two weeks after LT, the mean base excess of blood value (BE-B) restored to normal whereas plasma bicarbonate (HCO ) was still below normal value even with intermittent sodium bicarbonate correction. It also showed marked reduction in propionylcarnitine (C3) and C3/C2 level and the mean urine MMA by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was reduced by 81.7% (P<0.01) but remained >72Ã higher than upper limit of normal. The -correcting medications were administered as before. The renal function of one case with renal insufficiency before LT (serum creatinine rising) maintained stable by adjusting the immunosuppressive regimen during the observation period. All patients survive to date.LT is an effective treatment to prevent  crisis, but patients with MMA tend to be metabolically fragile even after surgery. During perioperative period, close monitoring should be given for acidosis episodes so as to implement sodium bicarbonate correction. -correcting medications are still needed.

HIF-1Î± (hypoxia inducible factor family of transcription factors) is actively involved in the  of many tumors, although the relationship between its expression levels and clinical significance in GC still need to be established. In this study, the level of HIF-1Î± and NEDD4L mRNA and protein in 25 freshly frozen GC- and matched normal-tissues were determined by western blot and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Additionally, immunohistochemistry assay was performed to measure the protein level of NEDD4L and HIF-1Î± in 124 GC and 25 normal control tissues. We observed that the NEDD4L mRNA and protein levels decreased significantly (P < 0.001) in GC tissues, while that of HIF-1Î± increased (P < 0.001), and they both were associated with a poor prognosis, as was the case in patients with lower NEDD4L and higher HIF-1Î± expression (P < 0.001). On correlation analysis, a significantly negative relationship (r = 0.288, P < 0.01) was revealed between NEDD4L and HIF-1Î± expressions. Multivariate analysis revealed that co-expression of NEDD4L (P < 0.05) and HIF-1Î± (P < 0.001) were independent predictors of GC prognosis. Thus, the correlation of NEDD4L and HIF-1Î± levels may act as a prognostic marker of GC.Â© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673293>Painless destructive thyroiditis in a patient with resistance to thyroid hormone: a case report.</a></h1><p>Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) usually features a syndrome of inappropriate secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (SITSH) without suppression of the typical high thyroid hormone levels. However, some patients with RTH show thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression due to thyrotoxicosis. We report a case of painless thyroiditis in a patient with RTH that was misdiagnosed as Graves' disease because of TSH-suppressed thyrotoxicosis.A sixteen-year-old boy consulted a local general physician for fatigue. He had a goiter, and biochemical analysis showed TSHâ<â0.1 Î¼IU/mL, free triiodothyronine (FT3) of 2.70âpg/mL, and free thyroxine (FT4) of 3.6âng/dL. He was diagnosed with Graves' disease and was treated with 20âmg thiamazole. One year later, he was referred to the department of endocrinology because of SITSH. He was finally diagnosed with RTH due to the finding of a heterozygous missense mutation (methionine 334 threonine) in the thyroid hormone receptor Î² gene. Three years after cessation of thiamazole, his hyperthyroxinemia showed marked exacerbation with TSH suppression. We diagnosed him with painless destructive thyroiditis because of low technetium-99âm (Tc-99âm) uptake in the thyroid. Extreme hyperthyroxinemia was ameliorated, with a return to the usual SITSH levels, within 1Â month without any treatment.The present case demonstrates that diagnosing RTH is difficult when patients show hyperthyroxinemia with complete suppression of TSH to undetectable levels, and the data lead to misdiagnosis of RTH as Graves' disease. The initial diagnosis is important, and Tc-99âm scintigraphy is useful for the differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis accompanying RTH.Â© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670980>Critical thinking about three meta-analyses: can vitamin D alone or with calcium prevent fractures?</a></h1><p>Critical thinking is crucially important in both research and practice.

PPFMs were isolated from ginger phyllosphere by leaf imprint technique and screened against major fungal phytopathogens of ginger viz. Macrophomina phaseolina, Sclerotium rolfsii, Pythium myriotylum, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Fusarium oxysporum. Among the 60 PPFMs, IISRGPPFM13 was selected for its highly inhibitory activity against the target pathogens. The isolate was useful for mineral solubility, production of IAA, siderophores and hydrolytic enzymes like cellulase, pectinase, lipase, amylase and chitinase. On in planta experiments revealed that IISRGPPFM13 considerably increased plant growth parameters when the bacterium was applied as soil drenching cum foliar spraying. Methanol utilization potential of the isolate was confirmed by mxaF gene analysis where the sequence showing 95.51% identity towards Methylobacterium platani and M. iners. Further, 16S rRNA gene sequence showing 98.73% identity with M. komagatae 002-079 (AB252201). This is the first report of its kind that a genus of Methylobacterium with biostimulant potential isolated from the phyllosphere of ginger.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671650>Dynamics of Plant  during Cold Acclimation.</a></h1><p>Plants have evolved strategies to tightly regulate  during acclimation to a changing environment. Low temperature significantly constrains distribution, growth and yield of many temperate plant species. Exposing plants to low but non-freezing temperature induces a multigenic processes termed cold acclimation, which eventually results in an increased freezing tolerance. Cold acclimation comprises reprogramming of the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome and affects communication and signaling between subcellular organelles. Carbohydrates play a central role in this  reprogramming. This review summarizes current knowledge about the role of carbohydrate  in plant cold acclimation with a focus on subcellular  reprogramming, its thermodynamic constraints under low temperature and mathematical modelling of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669989>Effect of Serratia sp. K3 combined with organic materials on cadmium migration in soil-vetiveria zizanioides L. system and bacterial community in contaminated soil.</a></h1><p>Phytoremediation is an economical strategy to harvest cadmium (Cd) from contaminated soil, but the efficiency of phytoremediation was affected by many factors. This study investigated the potential of Serratia sp. K3 (K3) assisted with straw biogas residue (SBR) or leavening fertilizer (LF) on improving the Cd migration efficiency and micro-environment in soil-vetiveria zizanioides L. system. The results showed that the acid soluble Cd in soil was increased by 2.83-29.79% in treatments compared with control (CK). In addition, Cd accumulation in the roots and shoots of vetiveria zizanioides were significantly enhanced by the combination of K3 and SBR/LF. Especially, the translocation factor of Cd increased by 21.53-62.37% in groups with K3 compared with the groups without K3, correspondingly. Furthermore, SBR/LF effectively changed bacterial community structure, and improved bacterial abundance. Relative abundance of functional genes related with carbohydrate/energy/amino acid  were increased in groups of SBRB/LFB rhizosphere compared with CK. These results provide insight into the change of phytoremediation efficiency and soil bacterial communities in the vetiveria zizanioides rhizosphere after inoculation. This study may provide a promising method for improving phytoremediation in Cd contaminated soil.Copyright Â© 2019.

Experiments determined effects of wheel exercise in C57B1 male mice, testing cardiovascular and autonomic function and characterization of the immunological profile. Sedentary (S) and exercise (ET) groups were treated with corticosterone (CORT) followed by injection of DFP. This model was associated with systolic and diastolic dysfunction in the S group, measured using echocardiography (ECHO). Chronic exercise ameliorated the cardiac deficit. Autonomic balance, accessed by heart rate variability (HRV), showed increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic modulation in S group. Autonomic balance in ET mice was not affected by DFP. Our DFP model resulted in mild neuroinflammation seen by increased IL5, IL12 and MIP2 in brain and plasma IL6 and IL1a.

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy  and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner.

This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant microbiota of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut microbiome in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut microbiota physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral microbiota could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of microbiome observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte , themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of microbiota to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation, cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut microbiota close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

PTH1R is a member of the class B of GPCRs, which all share a dynamic multidomain binding mechanism to the peptide hormone. For a long time, these complexes have been recalcitrant to structural studies despite their great therapeutic relevance. Through extensive engineering of both the receptor and the peptide agonist ligand, we were able to determine the first high-resolution structure of a PTH1R-agonist complex. Comparisons of the PTH1R crystal structure with subsequently reported cryo-electron microscopy structures of the same receptor in complex with a G protein, as well as with other class B GPCR structures bound to antagonists, reveal new insights into the two-step activation mechanism of class B GPCRs and extend our understanding of the precise molecular rearrangements during receptor activation.Â© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673578>Pilot data of serum proteins from children with autism spectrum disorders.</a></h1><p>Protein profiles of 13 serum samples from children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 11 serum samples from healthy volunteers was obtained using panoramic ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino acid availability, and its  actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle , particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Murine KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 14 (Klf14) is a maternally expressed imprinted transcription factor that is a component of the Mest imprinted gene cluster on mouse chromosome 6. We sought to determine if loss of Klf14 expression alters the course of normal mouse extraembryonic development. We also used high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to identify a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in placentas with loss of Klf14.We generated a Klf14 knockout (Klf14) mouse using recombineering and transgenic approaches. To identify DEGs in the mouse placenta we compared mRNA transcriptomes derived from 17.5dpc Klf14 and wild-type littermate placentas by RNAseq. Candidate DEGs were confirmed with quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qPCR) on an independent cohort of male and female gestational age matched Klf14 placentas.We found that 17.5dpc placentas inheriting a maternal null allele (Klf14) had a modest overgrowth phenotype and a near complete ablation of Klf14 expression. However, there was no effect on fetal growth. We identified 20 DEGs differentially expressed in Klf14 placentas by RNAseq, and subsequently validated five that are highly upregulated (Begain, Col26a1, Fbln5, Gdf10, and Nell1) by qPCR. The most enriched functional gene- included those classified as regulating cellular development and .These results suggest that loss of the maternal Klf14 locus in the mouse placenta acts results in changes in gene expression patterns that modulate placental growth.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Standard therapies aim to disrupt  that regulate the growth and survival of BC cells. Therapeutic agents such as endocrine therapy target hormone dependent cancer cells and have shown to be suitable approaches in BC treatment. However, in the case of metastatic BC, curative options are limited, thus strategies have been explored to improve survival and clinical benefit. In this review we provide an up to date overview of the development of anti-cancer agents, particularly the newly developed CDK4/6 inhibitors. A search of PubMed was conducted to identify preclinical data surrounding the development of endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors in early and metastatic BC. Clinical data were also sought using PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov. Agents targeting oestrogen and its receptor have demonstrated positive outcomes in clinical trial with improvements in objective responses and overall survival. However, patients do exhibit adverse effects and some will eventually fail to respond to endocrine therapy. Subsequently, the development and success of 3rd generation CDK4/6 inhibitors in preclinical studies has allowed their introduction in clinical studies. In patients with ERâ+âBC, CDK4/6 have demonstrated dramatic improvements in progression free survival when used in combination with endocrine therapies. Similar findings were also observed in metastatic disease. Adverse effects were limited in CDK4/6 treated patients, demonstrating the safety of these agents. CDK4/6 inhibitors are highly specific making them a safe and viable therapeutic for BC and there is increasing evidence of their potential to improve survival, even in the metastatic setting. Although a number of trials have demonstrated this, as a lone therapy or in combination, optimisation of treatment scheduling are still required in further clinical investigations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670476>Proteomics of epicardial adipose tissue in patients with heart failure.</a></h1><p>Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a metabolically active visceral fat depot closely linked to the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF). But the molecular signatures related to the mechanism of HF have not been systematically explored. Here, we present comprehensive proteomic analysis of EAT in HF patients and non-HF patients as controls. A total of 771 proteins were identified in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Amongst them, 17 increased in abundance in HF and seven decreased. They were involved in HF-related processes including inflammation and oxidative stress response and lipid . Of these proteins, serine proteinase inhibitor A3 (Serpina3) levels in EAT were highly up-regulated in HF, with HF/non-HF ratio of 4.63 (PÂ =Â .0047). Gene expression of Serpina3 via quantitative polymerase chain reaction was significantly increased in the HF group. ELISA analysis confirmed a significant increase in circulating plasma Serpina3 levels in the HF group (PÂ =Â .004). In summary, for the first time, we describe that parts of EAT proteome may be reactive and work as modulators of HF. Our profiling provides a comprehensive basis for linking EAT with pathogenesis of HF. Understanding the role of EAT may offer new insights into the treatment of HF.Â© 2019 The Authors.

Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85âyears of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<5%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4Â±5.9yrs, BMI: 29.5Â±5.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily energy expenditure, hypertension and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat  and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis. This article is protected by copyright.

Additional organics are generally supplemented to promote total nitrogen (TN) removal, reduce nitrite accumulation and sulfate production, and balance the pH decrease induced by SADN. However, understanding of the impacts of organic supplementation on microbial communities, nitrogen , denitrifier activity, and SADN rates in sulfur-based denitrification reactors is still limited. Here, a sulfur-based denitrification reactor was continuously operated for 272 days during which six different C/N ratios were tested successively (2.7, 1.5, 0.7, 0.5, 0.25, and 0). Organic supplementation improved TN removal and decreased NO accumulation, but reduced the relative abundance of denitrifiers and the contribution of autotrophic nitrate-reducing bacteria (aNRB) to TN removal during the long-term operation of reactor. Predictive functional profiling showed that nitrogen  potential increased with decreasing C/N ratios. SADN was the predominant removal process when the C/N ratio was â¤0.7 (achieving 60% contribution when C/Nâ¯=â¯0.7). Although organic supplementation weakened the dominant role of aNRB in denitrification, batch tests for the first time demonstrated that it could accelerate the SADN rate, attributed to the improvement of sulfur bioavailability, likely via the formation of polysulfide. A possible nitrogen removal pathway with multiple electron donors (i.e., sulfur, organics, sulfide, and polysulfide) in a sulfur-based denitrification reactor with organic supplementation was therefore proposed. However, supplementation with a high level of organics could increase the operational cost and effluent concentrations of sulfide and organics as well as enrich heterotrophic denitrifiers. Moreover, microbial community had substantial changes at C/N ratios of >0.5. Accordingly, an optimal C/N ratio of 0.25-0.5 was suggested, which could simultaneously minimize the additional operating cost associated with organic supplementation and maximize TN removal and SADN rates.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These compounds have been widely screened for their pharmacological effects. Polyphenols, such as soy-derived isoflavones, also called phytoestrogens, have been extensively studied due to their ability to inhibit carcinogenesis. These compounds are chemically similar to 17Î²-estradiol, and mimic the binding of estrogens to its receptors, exerting estrogenic effects in target organs. Genistein is an isoflavone derived from soy-rich products and accounts for about 60% of total isoflavones found in soybeans. Genistein has been reported to exhibit several biological effects, such as anti-tumor activity (inhibition of cell proliferation, regulation of the cell cycle, induction of apoptosis), improvement of glucose , impairment of angiogenesis in both hormone-related and hormone-unrelated cancer cells, reduction of peri-menopausal and postmenopausal hot flashes, and modulation of antioxidant effects. Additionally, epidemiological and clinical studies have reported health benefits of genistein in many chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis, and aid in the amelioration of typical menopausal symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. Although the biological effects are promising, certain limitations, such as low bioavailability, biological estrogenic activity, and effects on target organs, have limited the clinical applications of genistein to some extent. Moreover, studies report that modification of its molecular structure may eliminate the biological estrogenic activity and its effects on target organs. In this review, we summarize the potential benefits of genistein on menopause symptoms and menopause-related diseases like cardiovascular, osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, anxiety, depression, and breast cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671379>Stimulation of 5-HT serotonin receptor subtype in the hypothalamic arcuate nuclei (ARC) increases the cytochrome P450 activity in the liver.</a></h1><p>Our previous study has demonstrated that activation of the 5-HT, but not 5-HT serotonin receptor type in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) is responsible for the neuroendocrine regulation of liver cytochrome P450. The goal of these studies was to determine whether 5-HT serotonin receptor subtype in the ARC is engaged in the regulation of liver cytochrome P450.The 5-HT serotonin receptor agonist CP-809,101 was injected into the ARC for 5 days.

However, little is known about their effects on early recurrent miscarriage (RM). Here we aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1 on placental trophoblast cell  reprogramming, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of RM. After microarray and GEO database analyses, we found that EPB41L4A-AS1 was significantly increased in early RM placental tissue, and this increase may relate to estradiol-mediated upregulation of PGC-1Î±. EPB41L4A-AS1 overexpression inhibits glycolysis but increases the dependence on fatty acid oxidation in mitochondrion  and suppresses the Warburg effect, which is necessary for rapid growth of the placental villus, leading to miscarriage. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that EPB41L4A-AS1 functions as a lncRNA in the regulation of VDAC1 and HIF-1Î± expression through enhancement of H3K4me3 levels in the promoters of VDAC1 and HIF1A-AS1, a natural antisense transcript (NAT) lncRNA of HIF-1Î±. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that aberrant expression of EPB41L4A-AS1 is involved in the etiology of early RM, and it may be a candidate diagnostic hallmark and a potential therapeutic target for early RM treatment.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

However, researches on the impact of isoflurane on insulin-related  in the central nervous system, especially in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are scarce. This study sought to explore whether isoflurane anesthesia had a negative effect on insulin sensitivity both in peripheral and central tissues. Moreover, the possible role of isoflurane anesthesia in T2DM mice with pre-existing IR was analyzed. T2DM model in C57BL/6J mice was established by high fat diet (HFD) and single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Both HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice and normal mice received 6 h isoflurane exposure. Blood glucose level and serum insulin concentration were detected and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated to estimate peripheral IR. Relative levels of genes and proteins in the insulin-dependent signaling pathway in mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined to measure central IR. Results indicated that 6 h isoflurane exposure induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and raised HOMA-IR index. Meanwhile, phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) (Ser639) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-2 (pIRS2) (Ser731) were upregulated, while phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) (Ser473) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (pGSK3Î²) (Ser9) were downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of anesthetized mice. Notably, isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravated the degree of central IR in the aspects of gene transcriptions and protein expressions in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice with pre-existing IR. This study suggested that isoflurane anesthesia induced peripheral and central IR and aggravated pre-existing insulin resistance in T2DM mice.Copyright Â© 2019.

Therefore, cancer cells should suppress ER stress-mediated cell death and induce autophagy-which recycles metabolites to provide energy and new macromolecules. In this study, we demonstrate that the ER membrane protein BAP31 acts to suppress adaptation to ER stress conditions, induce cell death, and suppress autophagy by forming a BAP31-STX17 protein complex. The loss of BAP31 stimulates tumor growth in  stress conditions in vivo and enhances invasion activity.

Higher physical activity and high or adequate protein intake are thought to be beneficial in preventing the loss of skeletal muscle mass in the elderly. We aimed to investigate the relationships between physical activity, protein intake, and FFM in older people with mild disability.

Typhimurium) in mice, using a defined Pfs deletion mutant (i.e. Îpfs).Â  Pfs was essential for growth of S. Typhimurium in M9 minimal medium, in tissue cultured cells, and in mice.Â  Studies to resolve which of the three known functions of Pfs were key to murine virulence suggested that downstream production of auto-inducer 2, spermidine and methylthioribose were non-essential for Salmonella virulence in a highly sensitive murine model. Mass spectrometry revealed the accumulation of SAH in S. Typhimurium Îpfs and complementation of the Pfs mutant with the specific SAH hydrolase from Legionella pneumophila reduced SAH levels, fully restored growth ex vivo and the virulence of S. Typhimurium Îpfs for mice.Â  The data suggest that Pfs may be a legitimate target for antimicrobial development, and that the key role of Pfs in bacterial virulence may be in reducing the toxic accumulation of SAH which, in turn, suppresses an undefined methyltransferase.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670467>Cycles, Waves, and Pulses: Retinoic Acid and the Organization of Spermatogenesis.</a></h1><p>Spermatogenesis in mammals is organized in a manner that maximizes sperm production. The central aspect of this organization is the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium that is characterized by an asynchronous repeating series of germ cell associations. These cell associations are the result of a fixed point of entry into the cycle at regular short time intervals and the longer time required for cells to fully differentiate and exit the cycle.This review will examine the current information on the action and  of retinoic acid in the testis, the interaction of retinoic acid (RA) with the cycle and the spermatogenic wave, and the mechanisms that can lead to synchronous spermatogenesis. Finally, the unique applications of synchronous spermatogenesis to the study of the cycle and the mass isolation of specific germ cell populations are described.Retinoic acid  and spermatogonial differentiation have been examined by gene deletions, immunocytochemistry, chemical inhibitors, and mass spectrometry.Both the Sertoli cells and the germ cells have the capacity to synthesize retinoic acid from retinol and in the mouse the entry into the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium and the subsequent conversion of undifferentiated spermatogonia into differentiating spermatogonia is governed by a peak of RA synthesis occurring at stages VIII-IX of the cycle. Normal asynchronous spermatogenesis can be modified by altering RA levels and as a result the entire testis will consist of a few closely related stages of the cycle.Â© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671779>The Molecular Effects of Sulforaphane and Capsaicin on  upon Androgen and Tip60 Activation of Androgen Receptor.</a></h1><p>Androgen receptor (AR) stimulators, such as androgen and Tip60, play a pivotal role in prostatic carcinogenesis as androgen receptor signaling is critical for the growth and transformation of the prostate gland. Moreover, androgen and Tip60 promotes HIF-1Î± activation, involved in  reprogramming by increasing glycolysis, a hallmark in cancer initiation and development. In this study we evaluated the effect of androgen and Tip60 stimulus in AR pathway activation and HIF-1Î± stabilization, in terms of proliferation and cell  in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. The protective role of the bioactive compounds sulforaphane and capsaicin against the effect of these stimuli leading to pro-carcinogenic features was also addressed. Sulforaphane and capsaicin decreased nuclear AR, prostate specific antigen and Bcl-XL levels, and cell proliferation induced by androgen and Tip60 in LNCaP cells. These bioactive compounds prevented the increase in glycolysis, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activity, and reduced HIF-1Î± stabilization induced by androgen and Tip60 in LNCaP cells. The protective role of sulforaphane and capsaicin on prostate cancer may rely on mechanisms involving the inhibition of Tip60, AR and HIF-1Î± effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670473>Bain type of X-linked syndromic mental retardation in a male with a pathogenic variant in HNRNPH2.</a></h1><p>Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are RNA binding proteins, which aid in maturation, stabilization, and transport of mRNA.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³) primarily regulates the expression of target genes involved in energy control as well as lipid and glucose . Although the pivotal roles of these receptors on female fertility have been reported, there are limited studies addressing PPARs role(s) in the male. This study was designed to determine and compare  and  mRNA expression in sperm cells of normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic men. In addition, flow cytometric analyses, immunofluorescence and western blot were used to evaluate PPARÎ³ protein levels in spermatozoa. We have compared the sperm  mRNA relative expression in 27 normozoospermic and 28 asthenozoospermic samples and monitored sperm PPARÎ³ protein levels in 39 normozoospermic and 40 asthenozoospermic samples using flow cytometry. We have also assessed in a sub-group of seven normozoospermic and eight asthenozoospermic samples, PPARÎ³ protein levels by western blotting. Relative expression of PPARÎ³ mRNA in normozoospermic men was found to be significantly higher (P = 0.004) than in asthenozoospermic men while  and  relative expression was similar in the two groups. Likewise,  showed a positive correlation with motility (r = 0.34; P < 0.05), sperm concentration (r = 0.33) and the percentage of progressive motile spermatozoa (r = 0.31). In agreement with the mRNA behavior, sperm PPARÎ³ protein levels as measured by flow cytometry (P = 0.066) and western blot (P = 0.089) showed a tendency to be higher in normozoospermic than asthenozoospermic men.

The two isoforms, LXRÎ± (NR1H3) and LXRÎ² (NR1H2), are differentially expressed, with the former expressed predominantly in metabolically active tissues and the latter more ubiquitously. Both are activated by oxidised cholesterol metabolites, endogenously produced oxysterols. LXRs have important roles in lipid  and inflammation, plus a number of newly emerging roles. They are implicated in regulating lipid balance in normal male reproductive function and may provide a link between male infertility and lipid disorders and/or obesity. Studies from Lxr knockout mouse models provide compelling evidence to support this. More recently published data suggest distinct and overlapping roles of the LXR isoforms in the testis and recent evidence of a role for LXRs in human male fertility.

We hypothesized that low dietary Mg intake may alter sPTH response to s25OHD in a population with excess body weight, thereby leading to a worsening of cardiometabolic health. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-sectional study on adults who were either overweight or obese (owt/ob). Dietary Mg intake was measured using a Mg food frequency questionnaire (MgFFQ). Body composition information was measured using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Blood samples were obtained for all biochemical analyses. A total of 57 participants, 22 to 65 years of age, with a body mass index between 25 to 45 kg/m were divided into 3 groups, according to dietary Mg intake percentiles (Low Mg Groupâ¯=â¯<33 percentile, Medium Mg Groupâ¯=â¯33 to 66 percentile, High Mg Group = >66 percentile). Higher s25OHD was negatively associated with lower sPTH in the High Mg Intake group (râ¯=â¯-0.472, Pâ¯=â¯.041), but not in other groups. A positive relationship between s25OHD and serum high-molecular weight adiponectin concentrations was observed in the High Mg Group (râ¯=â¯0.532, râ¯=â¯0.022), but not in other groups. Serum Interleukin-6 concentrations were negatively associated with s25OHD (râ¯=â¯-0.316, Pâ¯=â¯.017) for the entire study group. Based on these results, our study demonstrated that a low dietary Mg intake may alter PTH response to 25OHD.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

NO is synthesized from l-arginine through the action of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family of enzymes, which includes three isoforms: endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). iNOS-derived NO has been associated with the pathogenesis and progression of several diseases, including liver diseases, insulin resistance, obesity and diseases of the cardiovascular system. However, transient NO production can modulate  to survive and cope with stress conditions. Accumulating evidence strongly imply that iNOS-derived NO plays a central role in the regulation of several biochemical  and energy  including glucose and lipid  during inflammatory conditions.

Cardiovascular abnormalities such as bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), coarctation of the aorta (CoA), aortic stenosis (AS), and aortic dilatation (AD) account for some cases of TS-related early mortality. In this study, we investigated the correlations between cardiovascular phenotypes and karyotypes in TS.We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 105 local patients with TS aged 6-43 years between January 1994 and December 2018. They were categorized into two groups of complete monosomy X (45,X) and other X chromosome abnormalities. Most of the patients underwent echocardiography (nÂ =Â 88, 83.8%), cardiac computed tomography (CT) angiography, and/or cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (nÂ =Â 58, 55.2%). We used independent the Student's t test, chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and log-rank test to compare differences in continuous data, proportions, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis results between the two TS groups.45,X was the most common karyotype (nÂ =Â 47, 44.8%). Phenotypically, cardiovascular malformations were found in 29 patients with TS (27.6%).

Epidemiological studies have associated measles with increased morbidity and mortality for years after infection, but the reasons why are poorly understood. Measles virus infects immune cells, causing acute immune suppression. To identify and quantify long-term effects of measles on the immune system, we used VirScan, an assay that tracks antibodies to thousands of pathogen epitopes in blood. We studied 77 unvaccinated children before and 2 months after natural measles virus infection. Measles caused elimination of 11 to 73% of the antibody repertoire across individuals. Recovery of antibodies was detected after natural reexposure to pathogens. Notably, these immune system effects were not observed in infants vaccinated against MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), but were confirmed in measles-infected macaques. The reduction in humoral immune memory after measles infection generates potential vulnerability to future infections, underscoring the need for widespread vaccination.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Therefore, elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of skeletal growth and development are expected to lead to the discovery of novel genes and  related to muscle disease. miR-206, a skeletal muscle-specific microRNA, plays a crucial role in myogenesis; however, miR-206 is known to function in myogenic differentiation, whether or not it affects muscle cells' proliferation, and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of miR-206 on muscle cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as its effect on myofiber type conversion using mouse C2C12 myoblasts. The results showed that overexpression of miR-206 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted muscle cell differentiation, but it did not affect myofiber type conversion. Intriguingly, we found that overexpression of miR-206 suppressed muscle cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in G/G phase by inhibiting the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase () gene.

We hypothesized that total fermentation but not the source (type) of FM would be the main factor in determining cellular /molecular outcomes in the healthy colon epithelia. The main aim of this study was to elucidate the role of two different sources of FM, fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and wheat bran (WB), on the expression of genes involved in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) transport, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, cell proliferation and oncogenesis in colon epithelia of healthy rats. Male Fischer 344 rats (nâ¯=â¯10/group) were fed AIN-93G control (0% FM) or experimental diets containing WB (~1%, 2%, or 5% FM) or FOS (~2%, 5%, or 8% FM). Rats were killed after 6 weeks and the colon mucosa was assessed for the expression of target genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. By comparison to the control, dose-related changes of mRNA levels were found in rats fed FOS-based diets, including: (a) upregulation of three SCFA transporters (Smct2, Mct1 and Mct4) but downregulation of Mct2, (b) upregulation of Gpr109a and downregulation of Gpr120, Gpr43, Gprc5a, Rgs2 and Rgs16, (c) upregulation of apoptosis-related genes including Bcl2, Bcl2-like 1, Bak1, Caspase 3, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9, (d) downregulation of the oncogenes and metastasis genes Ros1, Fos, Cd44, Fn1 and Plau, and (e) downregulation of several genes involved in cellular proliferation including Hbegf, Hoxb13, Cgref1, Wfdc1, Tgm3, Fgf7, Nov and Lumican. In contrast, rats fed WB-based diets resulted in dose-related upregulation of mRNA levels of Smct2, Rgs16, Gprc5a, Gpr109a, Bcl2-like 1, Caspase 8, and Fos. Additionally, different gene expression responses were observed in rats fed FOS and WB at 2% and 5% FM. Over all, these gene changes elicited by FOS and WB were independent of the expression of the tumor suppressor Tp53. These results suggest that fermentation alone is not the sole determinant of gene responses in the healthy rat colon.Crown Copyright Â© 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Treatments for fibrosis remain experimental, in part because no unifying mechanism has been identified that initiates liver fibrosis. Necroptosis has been implicated in multiple liver diseases. Here, we report that O-linked Î²-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification protects against hepatocyte necroptosis and initiation of liver fibrosis. Decreased O-GlcNAc levels were seen in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and in mice with ethanol-induced liver injury. Liver-specific O-GlcNAc transferase-KO (OGT-LKO) mice exhibited hepatomegaly and ballooning degeneration at an early age and progressed to liver fibrosis and portal inflammation by 10 weeks of age. OGT-deficient hepatocytes underwent excessive necroptosis and exhibited elevated protein expression levels of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), which are key mediators of necroptosis. Furthermore, glycosylation of RIPK3 by OGT is associated with reduced RIPK3 protein stability. Taken together, these findings identify OGT as a key suppressor of hepatocyte necroptosis, and OGT-LKO mice may serve as an effective spontaneous genetic model of liver fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672701>Glutamine Deprivation Induces PD-L1 Expression via Activation of EGFR/ERK/c-Jun Signaling in Renal Cancer.</a></h1><p>The programmed death-ligand 1/programmed death-1 (PD-L1/PD-1) pathway plays a pivotal role in the immune escape of tumours. Many tumour cells show "glutamine dependence". However, the relationship between glutamine  and PD-L1 expression has not been reported. In this study, changes in PD-L1 expression in renal carcinoma cells were evaluated during glutamine deprivation and recovery. Although PD-L1 expression differed in two renal cancer cell lines, both cell lines upregulated PD-L1 during glutamine deprivation, and the upregulated PD-L1 was restored to normal after glutamine recovery. Mechanistically, glutamine deprivation resulted in activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling via extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun. Additionally, treatment of renal cancer cells with EGF also induced PD-L1 expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Finally, inhibitors of EGFR, ERK, and c-Jun all inhibited phosphorylation of c-Jun and downregulated PD-L1 expression induced by glutamine deprivation. Taken together, the data suggest that glutamine regulates the expression of PD-L1 through the EGFR/ERK/c-Jun pathway in renal cancer. Implications: This study reveals glutamine deprivation induces PD-L1 expression via activation of EGFR/ERK/c-Jun signaling in renal cancer and provides novel markers for the treatment of renal cancer.Copyright Â©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675497>Stress-Induced  Disorder in Peripheral CD4 T Cells Leads to Anxiety-like Behavior.</a></h1><p>Physical or mental stress leads to neuroplasticity in the brain and increases the risk of depression and anxiety. Stress exposure causes the dysfunction of peripheral T lymphocytes. However, the pathological role and underlying regulatory mechanism of peripheral T lymphocytes in mood disorders have not been well established. Here, we show that the lack of CD4 TÂ cells protects mice from stress-induced anxiety-like behavior. Physical stress-induced leukotriene B4 triggers severe mitochondrial fission in CD4 TÂ cells, which further leads to a variety of behavioral abnormalities including anxiety, depression, and social disorders. Metabolomic profiles and single-cell transcriptome reveal that CD4 TÂ cell-derived xanthine acts on oligodendrocytes in the left amygdala via adenosine receptor A1. Mitochondrial fission promotes the de novo synthesis of purine via interferon regulatory factor 1 accumulation in CD4 TÂ cells.

Using cell surface biotinylation assays and highly inclined and laminated optical sheet microscopy we demonstrated that ARF4 enhanced NIS vesicular trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, whereas VCP - a principal component of ER-associated degradation - governed NIS proteolysis. Gene expression analysis indicated VCP expression was particularly induced in aggressive thyroid cancers and in patients who had poorer outcomes following RAI treatment. Two re-purposed Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved VCP inhibitors abrogated VCP-mediated repression of NIS function resulting in significantly increased NIS at the cell surface and markedly increased RAI uptake in mouse and human thyroid models. Collectively, these discoveries delineate NIS trafficking and highlight the new possibility of systemically enhancing RAI therapy in patients using FDA-approved drugs.Copyright Â©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669915>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor expression and its functions are regulated by androgen.</a></h1><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is an important pharmacological target for type 2 diabetes mellitus because it maintains glucose homeostasis and promotes Î² cell proliferation. Androgen is suggested not only to regulate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis but also to affect . In this study, Glp1r mRNA was found widely expressed in normal male mice and its levels were positively correlated with the serum testosterone (T) concentrations. Using mouse insulinoma 6 (MIN6) cells, which highly express GLP-1R, we observed GLP-1R was upregulated both at transcriptional and protein levels induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and was downregulated by androgen receptor inhibitor ARN-509 or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Glp1r mRNA. In normal C57BL/6 mice and db/db mice, Glp1r mRNA levels in the pancreases increased in the DHT treatment group and decreased in the ARN-509 treatment group. And the increased GLP-1R expression had insulinotropic function both in vitro and in vivo. Further analysis showed that the androgen receptor (Ar) located in the cytosol of MIN6 cells and translocated to the nucleus after DHT treatment. In addition, we found that there was an Ar motif in the promoter region of the Glp1r gene. Further studies revealed that the translocated DHT/Ar complex from the cytosol to the nucleus bound to the Ar motif of the Glp1r gene and upregulated gene transcription. Taken together, the widely expressed GLP-1R was positively regulated by androgen under physiological condition and in diabetic models at the transcriptional level.Copyright Â© 2019.

The f information is critical to the understanding the risk of victim drug-drug interactions in the clinic. Inhibitor selectivity is essential in order to generate reliable data and irreversible inhibitors are often preferred over reversible inhibitors to minimize the impact of inhibitor depletion. Although many selective cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors are available, identification of selective CYP2B6 inhibitors have been challenging due to cross inhibition to the other enzymes. In this study, dasotraline is evaluated as a selective inactivator of CYP2B6 under reaction phenotyping conditions with human hepatocytes. The results show that dasotraline is a very selective inactivator for CYP2B6 with minimal inhibition to other enzymes. A concentration of 0.1 Î¼M dasotraline is recommended for reaction phenotyping with a hepatocyte cell density of 0.5 million cells/mL or 0.5 Î¼M for 2 million cells/mL, when using a 15 minute preincubation, as well as the protocol of inactivator removal before addition of substrates.This article is protected by copyright.

Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD, and especially NASH, are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) predisposes to NAFLD development and progression via insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed. Taking into consideration the global increasing prevalence of NAFLD/NASH, therapeutic options that can prevent or treat this disease will exert considerable benefits on human health.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Despite being recommended as primary vascular access, the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) shows sub-optimal results, with about 50% of patients needing a revision during the year following creation. After the AVF is created, the venous wall must adapt to new environment. While hemodynamic changes are responsible for the adaptation of the extracellular matrix and activation of the endothelium, surgical dissection and mobilization of the vein disrupt the , causing wall ischemia and oxidative stress. As a consequence, migration and proliferation of vascular cells participate in venous wall thickening by a mechanism of neointimal hyperplasia (NH). When aggressive, NH causes stenosis and AVF dysfunction. In this review we show how hypoxia, , and flow parameters are intricate mechanisms responsible for the development of NH and stenosis during AVF maturation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672299>Treatment of Differentiated Thyroid Carcinomas.</a></h1><p>Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common thyroid cancer and is frequently encountered in clinical practice.

Daily glucose variability was evaluated by mean amplitude of glycemic excursions [MAGE], percentage coefficient of variation for glucose (%CV), and day-to-day glucose variability (mean of daily differences [MODD]) by using continuous glucose monitoring. Correlations of clinical factors, including insulin secretion ability by the GST with MAGE, %CV, and MODD, were analyzed.In 83 T2DM with insulin therapy, age and hemoglobin A (HbA) correlated with MAGE and %CV, fasting plasma glucose with MAGE and MODD, and increment of C-peptide immunoreactivity (ÎCPR) by GST correlated inversely with MAGE, %CV, and MODD. In 126 T2DM without insulin therapy, age, diastolic blood pressure, and triglycerides correlated with MODD, HbA with MAGE and MODD, and ÎCPR inversely correlated with %CV. Use of Î±-glucosidase inhibitors inversely correlated with %CV, whereas that of sulfonylurea was associated with MAGE and %CV.These results suggest that ÎCPR correlated with stability of glycemic control, whereas poorly controlled diabetes is associated with increase in glucose variability. Î±-glucosidase inhibitors may be superior to sulfonylureas in reducing the glucose variability in T2DM.Copyright Â© 2019.

Studies into the longevity effects of KRG are limited and have provided contradictory results, and the molecular mechanism of lifespan extension by KRG is not elucidated yet. Herein, the longevity effect of KRG was investigated in  by feeding KRG extracts, and the molecular mechanism of lifespan extension was elucidated by using longevity-related mutant flies. KRG extended the lifespan of  when administrated at 10 and 25 Î¼g/mL, and the longevity benefit of KRG was not due to reduced feeding, reproduction, and/or climbing ability in fruit flies, indicating that the longevity benefit of KRG is a direct effect of KRG, not of a secondary artifact. Diet supplementation with KRG increased the lifespan of flies on a full-fed diet but not of those on a restricted diet, and the longevity effect of KRG was diminished by the mutation of , a deacetylase known to mediate the benefits of dietary restriction. Similarly, the longevity effect of KRG was mediated by the reduction of insulin/IGF-1 signaling.

It is a potential biomarker for the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of iron  disorders. Serum hepcidin level can differ by 3 orders of magnitude depending on the patient's condition. Existing LC/MS assays lack clinical sensitivity or require costly sample preparation steps. A simple, sensitive, robust, and cost-effective assay for serum hepcidin quantitation in routine clinical laboratories is needed.An HPLC/MS/MS method was developed to quantify hepcidin in human serum using chemically synthesized hepcidin as a standard and stable isotope labeled hepcidin as internal standard. The method was validated according to CLSI-C62A guidelines. Calibrators were prepared with hepcidin-free serum. Clinical samples were separately processed and compared using solid phase extraction (SPE) and acetonitrile (ACN) protein precipitation.The calibration curve was validated over the range of 0.1-100 nmol/L with R2 >0.99. Both SPE and ACN had excellent and comparable reproducibility. The intra-day and inter-day CVs were <3% and <6%,. There was 89% and 88% hepcidin recovery by SPE and ACN preparation. Measurement of secondary reference material using non-traceable calibrators yielded up to 30% positive bias, comparable with values obtained by an external comparator. Hepcidin was stable in serum at ambient temperature and at 4Â°C. Relative errors (RE) were â¤1.2% and â¤4.4%, respectively. Freeze-thaw (-70Â°C) stability after 3 cycles showed a RE of â¤1.8%. The impact on hepcidin recovery due to hemolysis (4+), lipemia (4+) and Icterus (4+) was < 3%.We have developed and validated a simple, sensitive, robust, and cost-effective HPLC/MS/MS method for the quantitation of serum hepcidin. The method uses ACN protein precipitation for sample preparation and reverse-phase normal flow HPLC. Sample preparation is inexpensive; it can be automated with a liquid handling system to allow high-throughput application.This article is protected by copyright.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of phenanthrene on proximate composition and antioxidant activity in Piaractus brachypomus during a subacute exposure. Fish were exposed intraperitoneally to phenanthrene (0.1, 1.0, and 10â¯Î¼gâ¯g) and a solvent control (0â¯Î¼gâ¯g). Muscle tissue, liver and bile were collected at 0â¯h, 11â¯days and 21â¯days. In dorsal muscle, parameters such as dry matter, protein, crude fat, and pH did not show alterations with exposure to phenanthrene (pâ¯â¥â¯0.05). At 11â¯days, a significant increase of hepatic lipid peroxidation was observed in fish exposed to 10â¯Î¼gâ¯g. Additionally, a dose-dependent response was observed in the muscle, although no significant differences were observed in the activity of catalase and lipid peroxidation. Phenanthrene metabolites in bile were analysed by fixed fluorescence at 260/380â¯nm (excitation/emission) wavelengths and levels indicated a dose-dependent response. Likewise, bioaccumulation of phenanthrene in bile was observed for 21â¯days, suggesting slow  of this xenobiotic at 10â¯Î¼gâ¯g.

The physiological basis of molybdenum phytotoxicity is poorly understood. Plants take up molybdenum as molybdate, which is a structural analogue of sulfate. Therefore, it is presumed that elevated molybdate concentrations may hamper the uptake and subsequent  of sulfate, which may induce sulfur deficiency. In the current research, Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis) seedlings were exposed to 50, 100, 150 and 200 Î¼M Na MoO for nine days. Leaf chlorosis and a decreased plant growth occurred at concentrations â¥ 100 Î¼M. Root growth was more affected than shoot growth. At â¥ 100 Î¼M Na MoO , the sulfate uptake rate and capacity were increased, though only when expressed on a root fresh weight basis. When expressed on a whole plant fresh weight basis, which corrects for the impact of molybdate on the shoot-to-root ratio, the sulfate uptake rate and capacity remained unaffected. Molybdate concentrations â¥ 100 Î¼M altered the mineral nutrient composition of plant tissues, although the levels of sulfur metabolites (sulfate, water-soluble non-protein thiols and total sulfur) were not altered. Moreover, the levels of nitrogen metabolites (nitrate, amino acids, proteins and total nitrogen), which are generally strongly affected by sulfate deprivation, were not affected. The root water-soluble non-protein thiol content was increased and the tissue nitrate levels decreased, only at 200 Î¼M Na MoO . Evidently, molybdenum toxicity in Chinese cabbage was not due to the direct interference of molybdate with the uptake and subsequent  of sulfate.Â© 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673997>Benefits of thymol supplementation on performance, the hepatic antioxidant system, and energetic  in grass carp.</a></h1><p>Thymol is an herbal food additive used to improve animal performance. Thymol acts via its potential to enhance productive and reproductive performance, and by improving bioavailability of nutrients in fish. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms associated with these phenomena remain poorly understood, although recent evidence has suggested the involvement of the phosphotransfer network and antioxidant status. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the improvement of the antioxidant/oxidant status and the phosphoryl transfer network may be involved in enhanced growth performance in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) fed with various levels of thymol (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed). Thymol-supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) produced higher body weight and weight gain for 60-day post-feeding compared to the control group. Specific growth rate was higher; while feed conversion ratio was lower in fish that consumed 100 mg of thymol/kg compared to other groups. Hepatic lactate dehydrogenase activity and lipid peroxidation levels were lower in the thymol-supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group, while reactive oxygen species were lower in all supplemented groups than in the control group. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (300 mg/kg feed) and glutathione peroxidase (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed) activities, as well as antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (100 mg/kg feed) were higher in these groups than in the control group. Based on these data, we conclude that 100 mg thymol/kg dietary supplementation increased growth performance of fingerling grass carp. Finally, hepatic adenylate kinase activity was lower in the thymol supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group. Thymol supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) improved hepatic energy , while practically all tested concentrations of thymol enhanced hepatic antioxidant status, all of which may be  involved in increased growth performance in fingerling grass carp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672445>SIRT1 activation rescues the mislocalization of RNA-binding proteins and cognitive defects induced by inherited cobalamin disorders.</a></h1><p>The molecular consequences of inborn errors of vitamin B12 or cobalamin  are far from being understood. Moreover, innovative therapeutic strategies are needed for the treatment of neurological outcomes that are usually resistant to conventional treatments. Our previous findings suggest a link between SIRT1, cellular stress and RNA binding proteins (RBP) mislocalization in the pathological mechanisms triggered by impaired vitamin B12 .The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of the pharmacological activation of SIRT1 using SRT1720 on the molecular mechanisms triggered by impaired methionine synthase activity. Experiments were performed in vitro with fibroblasts from patients with the cblG and cblC inherited defects of vitamin B12  and in vivo with an original transgenic mouse model of methionine synthase deficiency specific to neuronal cells. Subcellular localization of the RBPs HuR, HnRNPA1, RBM10, SRSF1 and Y14 was investigated by immunostaining and confocal microscopy in patient fibroblasts. RBPs methylation and phosphorylation were studied by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. Cognitive performance of the transgenic mice treated with SRT1720 was measured with an aquatic maze.Patient fibroblasts with cblC and cblG defects of vitamin B12  presented with endoplasmic reticulum stress, altered methylation, phosphorylation and subcellular localization of HuR, HnRNPA1 and RBM10, global mRNA mislocalization and increased HnRNPA1-dependent skipping of IRF3 exons. Incubation of fibroblasts with cobalamin, S-adenosyl methionine and okadaic acid rescued the localization of the RBPs and mRNA. The SIRT1 activating compound SRT1720 inhibited ER stress and rescued RBP and mRNA mislocalization and IRF3 splicing. Treatment with this SIRT1 agonist prevented all these hallmarks in patient fibroblasts but it also improved the deficient hippocampo-dependent learning ability of methionine synthase conditional knock-out mice.By unraveling the molecular mechanisms triggered by inborn errors of cbl  associating ER stress, RBP mislocalization and mRNA trafficking, our study opens novel therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of inborn errors of vitamin B12 .Copyright Â© 2019.

Although previous studies have reported the negative effects of AgNMs on various microorganisms, little is known about the response of bacteria under the exposure of AgNMs at the cellular level. Here, we report the multiple responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (PAO1) under the exposure of two types of AgNMs, including spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and fibrous silver nanorods (AgNRs), by physiological experiments, microscopy, synchrotron-based X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), flow cytometry and genome-wide RNA sequencing. Our results demonstrated that the exposure to both types of AgNMs could inhibit the growth of PAO1, accompanied by the overproduction of oxidative stress and inducing cell membrane damage. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the roughened cell membrane under both AgNMs treatment. In addition, both AgNMs repressed the expression of quorum sensing and metal efflux-related genes in PAO1, but stimulated denitrification, glycerol and amino acid metabolisms, SOS response and pyocin overproduction of PAO1. Compared to AgNRs, AgNPs exposure showed a much lower threshold concentration to trigger the inhibitory effect and induced greater transcriptional responses of PAO1. This study suggested that AgNMs could cause multiple effects on the proliferation, , virulence and pathogenesis of PAO1, which might further affect the corresponding environmental microbial communities. Overall, our findings offer insights into the interactions between AgNMs and bacteria at the molecular level.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we summarize the recent advances in miRNA-mediated regulation of steroidogenesis with emphasis on adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672444>Clinical usefulness of human serum nonmercaptalbumin to mercaptalbumin ratio as a biomarker for diabetic complications and disability in activities of daily living in elderly patients with diabetes.</a></h1><p>Oxidative stress may play an important role in the development of diabetic complications. The ratio of human nonmercaptalbumin (HNA; oxidized form) to human mercaptalbumin (HMA; reduced form) has attracted attention as an indicator for systemic redox states. In this study, we measured the ratio in elderly patients with diabetes and evaluated its association with diabetic complications and disability in activities of daily living (ADL disability).One hundred twenty-six elderly patients with diabetes, aged 70â¯years and older, under medical care at Yukuhashi Central Hospital from April 2018 to June 2018, were continuously recruited. HNA%, defined as HNA / (HNAâ¯+â¯HMA)â¯Ãâ¯100, was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography method. First, multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate which variables were significant determinants for HNA%. Next, to evaluate the association of HNA% with ADL disability, logistic regression analysis in various models was performed. Then we plotted the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calculated the under area the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity in each model.In elderly patients with diabetes, multiple regression analysis showed that serum bilirubin levels and albumin levels, both of which are major endogenous anti-oxidants, and chronic renal failure (or proliferative nephropathy) were significantly associated with HNA%, suggesting that HNA% may be a good biomarker for oxidative stress in those patients. We then evaluated the association of HNA% with ADL disability in various logistic regression models. Model using only HNA% showed that it was a significant determinant for ADL disability (OR 1.158, 95% CI 1.077-1.244, Pâ¯<â¯.001). Model using HNA% and age showed that both variables were significant determinants for ADL disability (OR 1.160, 95% CI 1.069-1.258, Pâ¯<â¯.001; OR 1.258, 95% CI 1.110-1.427, Pâ¯<â¯.001, respectively). ROC analysis showed that the AUC of HNA% alone was 0.765. The AUC of model using HNA% and age was further increased to 0.866.HNA% was significantly associated with diabetic complications and ADL disability, thereby may be clinically useful as an oxidative stress marker in elderly patients with diabetes.Copyright Â© 2019.

In eukaryotes, RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are key players of RNA  that includes synthesis, processing, editing, modifying, transport, storage and stability of RNA. In plants, the family of RBPs is vastly expanded compared to other eukaryotes including humans. In this study we identified 363 RBPs in the barley genome. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of barley RBPs indicated these proteins were in all the major cellular compartments and associated with key biological processes including translation, splicing, seed development and stress signaling. Members with the classical RNA binding motifs such as the RNA recognition motif (RRM), KH domain, Helicase, CRM, dsRNA and Pumilio were identified in the repertoire of barley RBPs. Similar to Arabidopsis, the RRM containing RBPs were the most abundant in barley genome. In-depth analysis of the RRM containing proteins - polyA binding proteins, Ser/Arg rich proteins and Glycine-rich RBPs were undertaken. Reanalysis of the proteome dataset of various stages during barley malting identified 38 RBPs suggesting an important role for these proteins during the malting process. This survey provides a systematic analysis of barley RBPs and serves as the basis for the further functional characterization of this important family of proteins.Copyright Â© 2018.

The presence of microplastics have been recorded in the tissues of many wild fish species, and laboratory studies have demonstrated that microplastics can exert adverse health effects. To further investigate the biological mechanisms underlying microplastics toxicity we applied an integrated approach, analyzing the effects of microplastics at transcriptomic, histological and behavioral level. Adult zebrafish have been exposed to two concentrations of high-density polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics for twenty days. Transcriptomic results indicate alterations in the expression of immune system genes and the down-regulation of genes correlated with epithelium integrity and lipid . The transcriptomic findings are supported by tissue alterations and higher occurrence of neutrophils observed in gills and intestinal epithelium. Even the daily rhythm of activity of zebrafish appears to be affected, although the regular pattern of activity is recovered over time. Considering the transcriptomic and histological findings reported, we hypothesize that the effects on mucosal epithelium integrity and immune response could potentially reduce the organism defense against pathogens, and lead to a different utilization of energy stores.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673996>Brain transcriptome profile after CRISPR-induced ghrelin mutations in zebrafish.</a></h1><p>Ghrelin (GRL) is a gut-brain hormone with a role in a wide variety of physiological functions in mammals and fish, which points out the ghrelinergic system as a key element for the appropriate biological functioning of the organism. However, many aspects of the multifunctional nature of GRL remain to be better explored, especially in fish. In this study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique to generate F0 zebrafish in which the expression of grl is compromised. Then, we employed high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to explore changes in the brain transcriptome landscape associated with the silencing of grl. The CRISPR/Cas9 technique successfully edited the genome of F0 zebrafish resulting in individuals with considerably lower levels of GRL mRNAs and protein and ghrelin O-acyl transferase (goat) mRNAs in the brain, intestine, and liver compared to wild-type (WT) zebrafish. Analysis of brain transcriptome revealed a total of 1360 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the grl knockdown (KD) and WT zebrafish, with 664 up- and 696 downregulated DEGs in the KD group. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs are highly enriched for terms related to morphogenesis,  (especially of lipids), entrainment of circadian clocks, oxygen transport, apoptosis, and response to stimulus. The present study offers valuable information on the central genes and  implicated in functions of GRL, and points out the possible involvement of this peptide in some novel functions in fish, such as apoptosis and oxygen transport.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672450>Moderate and heavy alcohol consumption are prospectively associated with decreased left ventricular ejection fraction: The Hoorn Study.</a></h1><p>Data on the prospective relationship of alcohol consumption at more moderate levels with systolic and diastolic function are scarce. We aimed to examine the prospective association of alcohol consumption with echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function, in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes (T2DM).We included 778 participants from the Hoorn Study (aged 68.4Â Â±Â 7.2 years, 49% women), a population-based prospective cohort study, oversampled for people with impaired glucose  or T2DM. Self-reported alcohol consumption was collected at baseline with a validated food-frequency questionnaire and categorized into: none (0/week), light (>0-â¤30Â g/week), light-to-moderate (>30-â¤70Â g/week), moderate (>70-â¤140Â g/week), and heavy drinkers (>140Â g/week). Echocardiography was performed at baseline (NÂ =Â 778) and after 8 years follow-up (NÂ =Â 404). Multiple linear regression was used to study the association between alcohol consumption and echocardiographic measures (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial volume index (LAVI) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI)), adjusted for confounders. Moderate and heavy alcohol consumption were associated with a decreased LVEF of -3.91% (CI: -7.13;-0.69) for moderate and -4.77% (-8.18;-1.36) for heavy drinkers compared to light drinkers. No associations were found between alcohol consumption, LVMI and LAVI. Modified Poisson regression showed a trend that higher alcohol consumption amounts were associated with a higher risk of incident systolic dysfunction (LVEFâ¤50%) (P-for-trend 0.058).The findings provide longitudinal evidence that moderate and heavy alcohol consumption are associated with decreased LVEF and trend towards a higher risk of incident LV systolic dysfunction, compared to light drinkers.Copyright Â© 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

This trade-off is modulated by the energy requirements of prey, yet relatively few studies have incorporated physiological mechanisms for energy savings when considering the behavioural response of prey to predation risk. In our study, we aimed to determine individual variation in behaviour, resting , body temperature and response to 24-h starvation within a captive population of fat-tailed dunnarts (Sminthopsis crassicaudata; 15-g insectivorous marsupials), and then, using semi-outdoor enclosures, test whether foraging effort and thermal energetics are adjusted in response to manipulation of ground cover, which for small mammals can simulate predation risk. We found that, under the low cover (high predation risk) treatment, dunnarts consumed less food and employed a greater daily reduction in body temperature between their active and rest phase. This result supports the hypothesis that rest-phase thermoregulatory energy savings are employed, even when food is available, if predation risk is perceived to increase the cost of foraging. Individuals exhibited correlated variation along two orthogonal axes incorporating the measured behavioural and  variables, but these differences were not correlated with responses to starvation and predation risk. Our experiment demonstrates that flexibility in daily energy requirements provided by heterothermy can have important consequences for how small mammals respond to both starvation and predation risks. Such challenges are amplified in degraded habitat with introduced predators, making the capacity for heterothermy an even more important mechanism for survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671603>Glucagon Regulation of Energy Expenditure.</a></h1><p>Glucagon's ability to increase energy expenditure has been known for more than 60 years, yet the mechanisms underlining glucagon's thermogenic effect still remain largely elusive.

However, the combination and manipulation of variables (intensity and volume) allow for different training adaptations.This review aimed to investigate the effect of ST on EE in adults using a systematic literature review and subsequent meta-analysis.The search was performed on the electronic databases using the following keywords: strength training (resistance training; strength training; strength training method) and energy expenditure (energy ; energy expenditure; caloric expenditure, caloric cost) with "AND" and "OR" combination. Manual searches of references were also conducted for additional relevant studies. After evaluating the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the selected studies were analyzed according to strength training methods and the training variables used to measure EE.We identified two ST methods from the literature review: circuit training (CT) and traditional training (TT). Meta-analysis showed a significant effect on EE increase, which favor TT when compared with CT (-0.99 [95%CI: -1.96, -0.02], p < 0.01) with I of 89% (p < 0.01). After adjusting for bias risk, no significant differences were found in EE associated with intensity (-0.40, 95% CI [0.98, 0.18], p = 0.18).The present review and meta-analysis indicated that the intensity of exercise does not seem to be associated with an increase of EE in ST.Â© 2019 Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.

Despite extensive research in animal models and numerous promising treatment trials, there is still no curative treatment for AD. Astrocytes, the most common cell type of the central nervous system, have been shown to play a role in the major AD pathologies, including accumulation of amyloid plaques, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Here, we show that inflammatory stimulation leads to  activation of human astrocytes and reduces amyloid secretion. On the other hand, the activation of oxidative  leads to increased reactive oxygen species production especially in AD astrocytes. While healthy astrocytes increase glutathione (GSH) release to protect the cells, Presenilin-1-mutated AD patient astrocytes do not. Thus, chronic inflammation is likely to induce oxidative damage in AD astrocytes. Activation of NRF2, the major regulator of cellular antioxidant defenses, encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, poses several beneficial effects on AD astrocytes. We report here that the activation of NRF2 pathway reduces amyloid secretion, normalizes cytokine release, and increases GSH secretion in AD astrocytes. NRF2 induction also activates the  of astrocytes and increases the utilization of glycolysis. Taken together, targeting NRF2 in astrocytes could be a potent therapeutic strategy in AD.Â© 2019 The Authors.

Since prevention of osteoporosis is important, it might act as a potential cofactor in osteoporosis prevention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of VSEE on osteoporosis and abnormal lipid metabolisms.MC3T3-E1 cell and OVX rat model were used to evaluate VSEE on regulation of bone and lipid metabolisms. Differentiation and matrix mineralization of preosteoblast were significantly increased by VSEE (P <0.05), which attributed to stimulating calcium influx, then to activating Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway and regulating runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). VSEE could cross Caco-2/HT-29 co-cultured monolayer via paracellular pathway and peptide transporter (PepT1), and could be detected in blood and maximum concentration was 122.84Â± 3.68 mg/L at 60 min. Additionally, VSEE was found to reverse bone loss and regulate dyslipidemia through Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway in OVX rats. Firmicutes phylum, Veillonellaceae, Prevotellaceae and six genera in VSEE group were significantly different compared with Model group (P <0.05).VSEE promotes bone growth and inhibit abnormal lipid  in OVX model through the regulation of intestinal microbiota compositions and Wnt/Î²-catenin signal pathway.

Herein, according to slight differences in the 3D structure and substrate preference between CYP1A1 and its homologous CYP1A2, a series of novel ratiometric fluorescent probes were designed and synthesized using 1,8-naphthalimide because of its trait of naked-eye visualization and ratiometric fluorescence to achieve the detection of CYP1A1 in biological samples. Among these probes, NEiPN showed good water solubility, highly isoform selectivity and great sensitivity (LOD = 0.04874 nM) for CYP1A1 under simulated physiological conditions, which makes it favorable for monitoring CYP1A1 in vivo. Remarkably, NEiPN exhibited excellent reproducibility when it was used to detect the CYP1A1 content in human liver microsomes, which indicated that it has a great potential for quantifying the CYP1A1 content in real biological samples. Furthermore, NEiPN showed relatively low cytotoxicity and has been successfully applied in biological imaging in living cells and zebrafish. These findings indicate that NEiPN is capable of real-time monitoring of the activity of endogenous CYP1A1, which could provide support for CYP1A1-associated pathological processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672446>Predictive value of gastrointestinal hormones on weight loss.</a></h1><p>Bariatric surgery leads to profound and sustainable weight loss. Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (nâ¯=â¯9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (nâ¯=â¯5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (nâ¯=â¯17) or a RYGB (nâ¯=â¯11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright Â© 2019.

Current insights and future perspectives for novel therapies.</a></h1><p>Dyslipidemia and inflammation are closely interrelated contributors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Disorders of lipid  initiate an inflammatory and immune-mediated response in atherosclerosis, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering has possible pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects that extend beyond lipid lowering.Activation of the immune system/inflammasome destabilizes the plaque, which makes it vulnerable to rupture, resulting in major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The activated immune system potentially accelerates atherosclerosis, and atherosclerosis activates the immune system, creating a vicious circle. LDL-C enhances inflammation, which can be measured through multiple parameters like high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). However, multiple studies have shown that CRP is a marker of residual risk and not, itself, a causal factor. Recently, anti-inflammatory therapy has been shown to decelerate atherosclerosis, resulting in fewer MACE. Nevertheless, an important side effect of anti-inflammatory therapy is the potential for increased infection risk, stressing the importance of only targeting patients with high residual inflammatory risk. Multiple (auto-)inflammatory diseases are potentially related to/influenced by LDL-C through inflammasome activation.Research suggests that LDL-C induces inflammation; inflammation is of proven importance in atherosclerotic disease progression; anti-inflammatory therapies yield promise in lowering (cardiovascular) disease risk, especially in selected patients with high (remaining) inflammatory risk; and intriguing new anti-inflammatory developments, for example, in nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat-containing pyrine receptor inflammasome targeting, are currently underway, including novel pathway interventions such as immune cell targeting and epigenetic interference.

Linear mixed models were also used to test the longitudinal association between NfL and [F]FDG in amyloid positive (AÎ²+) and negative (AÎ²-) subjects.Higher concentrations of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid NfL were associated with reducedÂ [F]FDG uptake in correspondent brain regions. In AÎ²+ participants, NfL associates with hypometabolism in AD-vulnerable regions. Longitudinal changes in the association [F]FDG-NfL were confined to cognitively impaired AÎ²+ individuals.These findings indicate that plasma NfL is a proxy for neurodegeneration in AD-related regions in AÎ²+ subjects.Â© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672889>Itaconyl-CoA forms a stable biradical in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and derails its activity and repair.</a></h1><p>Itaconate is an immunometabolite with both anti-inflammatory and bactericidal effects. Its coenzyme A (CoA) derivative, itaconyl-CoA, inhibits B-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that itaconyl-CoA is a suicide inactivator of human and  MCM, which forms a markedly air-stable biradical adduct with the 5'-deoxyadenosyl moiety of the B coenzyme. Termination of the catalytic cycle in this way impairs communication between MCM and its auxiliary repair proteins. Crystallography and spectroscopy of the inhibited enzyme are consistent with a metal-centered cobalt radical ~6 angstroms away from the tertiary carbon-centered radical and suggest a means of controlling radical trajectories during MCM catalysis. Mycobacterial MCM thus joins enzymes in the glyoxylate shunt and the methylcitrate cycle as targets of itaconate in pathogen propionate .Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte . In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte lipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright Â© 2019.

Recent studies have shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from Gram-negative periodontal pathogens, so-called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), harbor various effector molecules responsible for inducing host inflammatory responses. However, there are no reports of EVs from F. alocis. In this study, we purified and characterized the protein profiles of EVs from F. alocis and investigated their immunostimulatory activity on human monocytic THP-1 and human oral keratinocyte HOK-16B cell lines. Highly pure EVs were obtained from F. alocis using density gradient ultracentrifugation. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy showed that F. alocis EVs were between 50 nm and 270 nm in diameter. Proteome analysis identified 28 proteins, including lipoproteins, autolysins, F. alocis complement inhibitor (FACIN), transporter-related proteins, -related proteins, and ribosomal proteins. Human cytokine array analysis showed that F. alocis EVs remarkably induced the expression of CCL1, CCL2, MIP-1, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10, ICAM-1, IL-1Î², IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, MIF, SerpinE, and TNF-Î± in THP-1 cells and CXCL1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-8 in HOK-16B cells. The immunostimulatory activity of F. alocis EVs was similar to that of the whole bacterial cells. Our findings provide new insight into the role of EVs from Gram-positive oral bacteria in periodontal diseases.Â© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The indication for RAI treatment was Graves in 5 (18.6%), toxic nodular or multinodular goiter in 16 (69.2%), and unknown in 6 (22.2%) patients. A total of 48 thyroid nodules were evaluated with FNAB and cytological diagnosis were benign in 24 (50.0%), nondiagnostic in 15 (31.2%), atypia of undetermined significance in 5 (10.4%), suspicous for malignancy in 2 (4.2%), and malignant in 2 (4.2%) nodules. Thyroidectomy was performed in 10 patients, 5 were benign (50.0%), and 5 (50.0%) were malignant histopathologically. Ultrasonography features of 31 cytologically/histopathologically benign and five cytologically/histopathologically malignant nodules were compared. Prevalence of isoechoic nodules was higher in benign nodules (P =â.025). Macrocalcification was observed in 4 (80.0%) of malignant and 10 (32.3%) of benign nodules (P =â.042).In patients with a history of RAI treatment for hyperthyroidism, thyroid nodules with suspicious ultrasonography features, particulary hypoechoic appearence and macrocalcification, should be evaluated with FNAB irrespective of the time elapsed after RAI treatment.Â© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675502>Integrated Proteogenomic Characterization of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>To elucidate the deregulated functional modules that drive clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), we performed comprehensive genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic characterization of treatment-naive ccRCC and paired normal adjacent tissue samples.

However, SGA treatment is associated with severe  alterations and body weight gain, which can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that  changes in insulin-sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the  disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole-body glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG, lipid dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on insulin signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and insulin secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the  side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670254>Molecular regulatory mechanisms of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in response to ultrasonic stress revealed by proteomic analysis.</a></h1><p>The antimicrobial effects of ultrasonic filed have been studied for years at the phenotypic level, but there is little research to reveal the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying the phenotypes. In this study, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteome was applied to analyze the regulatory  of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in response to ultrasonic stress in whole-genome scale. A total of 1856 differentially expressed proteins were identified, of which 1141 were significant up-regulated and 715 down-regulated compared with live control cells. The comprehensive proteome coverage analysis showed that ultrasonic filed influenced various   in Escherichia coli O157:H7 cells. The ultrasound-induced up-regulation of global stress response regulator RpoS, bacterial mechanosensitive channels and SOS response protein RecA were described from the molecular level for the first time. In addition, we proposed a possible action mechanism that the free radicals produced by acoustic cavitation might enter into cells via the activated mechanosensitive channels, leading to the elevated intracellular ROS level and subsequent cell death. Last but not the least, we illustrated the all-or-nothing phenomenon of power ultrasound might due to the destruction of crucial cell defensive systems, including heat shock proteins and oxidative response regulators. These new findings can let us understand the ultrasonic effects more deeply and will contribute to this area.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers or effective therapeutic options established for NAFLD. Nevertheless, there are several molecular targets in the pipeline, of which fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is one. FGF21 is secreted primarily from liver and has a plethora of  functions. Pre-clinical and epidemiological studies indicate a relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and hepatic fat content in both mice and humans. Moreover, animal studies have clearly shown that aberrant FGF21 signalling is a key pathological step in the development and progression of NAFLD. A recent Phase II clinical trial demonstrated that administration of an FGF21 analogue significantly reduced hepatic fat in subjects with NASH. As such, FGF21 provides a novel target for future biomarker and therapeutic studies. This review appraises preclinical data to outline the current understanding of FGF21 function in both normal hepatic function and NAFLD. Epidemiological evidence is explored to delineate the relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and NAFLD in humans. Finally, we review the therapeutic effects of FGF21 in the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright Â© 2019.

As there are numerous drastic differences between these two environments (including lower oxygen availability), we hypothesized that this life-history innovation might have produced adaptive pressures on the energy , which is partially encoded by the mitochondrial genome (OXPHOS). To test this hypothesis, we sequenced mitochondrial genomes of two Ancyrocephalinae species: mesoparasitic  and ectoparasitic . The mitogenomic architecture of  is mostly standard for monogeneans, but that of  exhibits some unique features: missing  gene, very low AT content (60%), a non-canonical start codon of the  gene, and exceptionally long tandem-repeats in the non-coding region (253 bp). Phylogenetic analyses produced paraphyletic Ancyrocephalinae (with embedded Dactylogyrinae), but with low support values. Selective pressure (PAML and HYPHY) and protein structure analyses all found evidence for adaptive evolution in  and  genes of the mesoparasitic . These findings tentatively support our hypothesis of adaptive evolution driven by life-history innovations in the mitogenome of this species. However, as only one stomach-inhabiting mesoparasitic monogenean was available for this analysis, our findings should be corroborated on a larger number of mesoparasitic monogeneans and by physiological studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671360>Inter-correlated gut microbiota and SCFAs changes upon antibiotics exposure links with rapid body-mass gain in weaned piglet model.</a></h1><p>The risk of overweight or obesity in association with early exposure of antibiotics remains an important public issue for health-care of children. Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal microbiota were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate " were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic microbiota to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity measures in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal-weight (77%) 2-6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (pâ<â0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (pâ<â0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (pâ>â0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (pâ<â0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal-weight population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of body fat in preschoolers. The role of vigorous PA in the prevention of early childhood obesity should be further investigated in future studies.ISRCTN ISRCTN41045021 .

Glucose  rate is increased in some tumours via HIF-1Î±. Our aim is to evaluate the relationship between hypoxia in colorectal cancer, PET parameters, necrotic tissue size and pathologic prognostic factors via using HIF-1Î±.70 patients (28 female/42 male; median age: 63 years) who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer via biopsy were staged with preoperative PET/CT and operated subsequently. Immunohistochemical evaluation scoring was done according to nuclear HIF-1Î± expression, staining density and intensity.  tumour volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and tumour volume (TV) were calculated by using volume of an ellipsoid formula via CT images, and percentage of tumour necrosis (%TmNcr) that was calculated by the difference between TV and recorded MTV.There was a moderately meaningful positive correlation between tumour SUVmax and TV and %TmNcr (r=0.403, p=0.001 and r=0.500, p=0.0001, respectively). There were no statistically significant relationships between HIF-1Î± expression levels and tumour SUVmax, TLG, MTV, TV, %TmNcr, tumour stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion and extracapsular/capsular lymph node involvement. On the other hand, strong nuclear immunohistochemical staining was seen in tumour cells adjacent to invasive border, inflammatory cells. Although not statistically significant, moderate or strong nuclear staining were seen in 64.9% of metastatic patients.Although the presence of a positive correlation between tumour SUVmax and %TmNcr shows that there are hypoxic cells in cancer tissue with high FDG uptake, the relationship between the presence of HIF-1Î± and enhanced glucose  and pathological prognostic factors of tumour was not shown. Strong nuclear immunohistochemical staining in tumour cells adjacent to invasive border and inflammatory cells leads us to believe that HIF-1Î± plays a role in the invasion area of tumour microenvironment.Copyright Â© 2019.

However, the activities of these  in hepatomas in vivo have not been distinguished.

The concentration of key metabolites and the expression of relevant enzymes were measured in hepatoma, surrounding liver, and normal liver.In orthotopic hepatomas, pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle occurred exclusively through PDH and the excess PDH activity compared to normal liver was attributed to downregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 2/4. However, pyruvate carboxylation via PC and gluconeogenesis were minimal, which was linked to downregulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by Akt activity. In contrast to many studies of cancer , lactate production in hepatomas was not increased which corresponded to reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase. The production of serine and glycine in hepatomas was enhanced, but glycine decarboxylase was downregulated.The combination of [U-C]glycerol and NMR analysis enabled investigation of multiple biochemical processes in hepatomas and surrounding liver. We demonstrated active PDH and other related  alterations in orthotopic hepatomas that differed substantially not only from the host organ but also from many earlier studies with cancer cells.Copyright Â© 2019.

In the present study, we sought to investigate whether vitamin E (Vit E) or reduced glutathione (GSH) enhances sperm production by decreasing ROS accumulation during in vitro maturation of prepubertal mice testes. Testes of prepubertal mice were cryopreserved using a freezing medium supplemented or not supplemented with Vit E and were cultured after thawing. In presence of Rol alone in culture medium, frozen-thawed (F-T) testicular tissues exhibited a higher ROS accumulation than fresh tissue during in vitro culture. However, Vit E supplementation in freezing, thawing, and culture media significantly decreased cytoplasmic ROS accumulation in F-T testicular tissue during in vitro maturation when compared with F-T testicular tissue cultured in the presence of Rol alone, whereas GSH supplementation in culture medium significantly increased ROS accumulation associated with cytolysis and tissue disintegration. Vit E but not GSH promoted a better in vitro sperm production and was a suitable ROS scavenger and effective molecule to improve the yield of in vitro spermatogenesis from F-T prepubertal mice testes. The prevention of oxidative stress in the cytoplasmic compartment should be regarded as a potential strategy for improving testicular tissue viability and functionality during the freeze-thaw procedure and in vitro maturation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669882>PINK1 depletion sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer to glycolytic inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate: Involvement of ROS and mitophagy.</a></h1><p>Despite significant strides in understanding the pathophysiology of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), these neoplasms typically present with intrinsic chemo- and radiotherapeutic resistance. Transcriptomic analyses of patient NSCLC tumors stratified by survival times have identified the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) as a molecular governor of tumor aggressiveness and patient survival time. PINK1â¯has been shown to confer neuroprotection in models of Parkinson Disease by ensuring proper mitochondrial turnover (mitophagy), the upkeep of ATP production and sequestering of reactive oxygen species (ROS).We utilized an shRNA against PINK1 and the glycolytic inhibitor 3-BP to assess effects on NSCLC viability via MTS cell viability assay. ATP levels, caspase-9 activation, mitophagy and ROS production were determined with standardly available kits. Cytochrome c cellular localization and phosphorylated parkin levels were determined using an ELISA.Our results demonstrate that PINK1 depletion in the NSCLC cell line A549 via shRNA, reduced cancer cell proliferation, increased cell death, reduced ATP production, inhibited mitophagy and increased ROS and caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. PINK1 depleted cells were more susceptible to the glycolytic inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP), which further perturbed ATP production. PINK1 depletion and 3-BP synergistically increased ROS production, caspase-9-dependent apoptosis and additively repressed mitophagy.These results suggest that PINK1 depletion alters energetic  and confers sensitivity to agents that inhibit glycolysis. Targeting accelerated tumor cell  may prove useful in the clinical setting while sparing non-malignant tissue.Copyright Â© 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

The present study aimed at understanding the expression profiles of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1-3 genes in red-crowned crane tissues. We used 14 individuals found dead in the wild in eastern Hokkaido or in Kushiro City Zoo. Nine CYP1-3 genes expressed in the liver of the red-crowned crane were identified by high-throughput sequencing, and phylogenetically classified as CYP1A5, CYP2C23, CYP2C45, CYP2D49, CYP2G19, CYP2U1, CYP2AC1, CYP3A37, and CYP3A80. Based on the quantitative real-time PCR of 13 samples, the rank order of their median expression levels was as follows: CYP3A37â¯>â¯CYP2AC1â¯>â¯CYP2C45â¯>â¯CYP2D49â¯>â¯CYP2G19â¯>â¯CYP1A5â¯>â¯CYP3A80â¯>â¯CYP2C23. The tissue distribution of the CYP transcripts indicated that many of the CYP1-3 genes examined were mainly expressed in the tissues where drug  occurs, such as the liver, kidneys, and lungs. We found that CYP3A37 was dominant at the transcript level in the liver, indicating it might play a crucial role in liver physiology and xenobiotic . Similarly, an "orphan" CYP2AC1 was expressed at relatively high levels in the kidneys and liver, suggesting a possible role in renal and liver physiology and xenobiotic .

However, vitamin C is not only an antioxidant, since it is also a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in plant and human . In humans, vitamin C takes part in various physiological processes, such as iron absorption, collagen synthesis, immune stimulation, and epigenetic regulation.

Sixty mice were exposed to 72-h sleep deprivation. Groups and drug administrations were as follows: Group 1 (control) received injection of vehicle. Group 2 received WIN 55,212,2. Group 3 received AM251 (CB1R antagonist) followed by WIN 55,212,2 injection. Group 4 received SR144528 (CB2R antagonist) followed by WIN 55,212,2 injection. Group 5 received only AM251. Group 6 received only SR144528. Blood samples were collected 1 h after drug administration and prepared for biochemical measurements. Glucose levels were measured by glucometer, whereas insulin and nesfatin-1 levels were measured by ELISA. Central nesfatin-1 was also assessed using immunohistochemistry. One-way analysis of variance together with post hoc Tukey's test was used for inter-group comparisons. Serum nesfatin-1 levels were comparable in all study groups. Brain nesfatin-1 immune-positive cell count was lower in WIN group compared to controls. The administration of CB1R or CB2R antagonist prevented reduction in nesfatin-1-positive cell count. Insulin resistance was higher in WINCB2 and CB2 groups than in control and WINCB1 groups. Cannabinoid treatment reduced nesfatin-1 immunoreactivity in the central nervous system and this effect was prevented by either CB1R or CB2R antagonist pretreatment.

PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from the earliest date possible until November 2018 to identify randomised controlled trials examining the effects of lifestyle interventions compared to usual care on patient health outcomes and components of  syndrome. Post-intervention means and standard deviations were pooled using inverse variance methods and random-effects models to calculate mean differences (MD), standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Searching identified 2598 articles, of which 15 articles reporting data from 10 trials, with 1160 participants were included in this review.

During hibernation, serum levels of cortisol, glycerol, and triglycerides were elevated, and protein expression and activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue were reduced. mRNA expression of the co-activator PGC-1Î± was reduced in all tissues in hibernation whereas mRNA expression of the transcription factor PPAR-Î± was reduced in the vastus lateralis muscle and adipose tissue only. During hibernation, gene expression of ATGL and CD36 was not altered; however, HSL gene expression was reduced in adipose tissue. During hibernation gene expression of the lipogenic enzyme DGAT in all tissues and the expression of the FA oxidative enzyme LCAD in the vastus lateralis muscle were reduced. Gene and protein expression of the glucose transporter GLUT4 was decreased in adipose tissue in hibernation.

Plant tissues are specialized in different functions, and petals conceal the sexual organs while attracting pollinators. Here we analyzed the transcriptional structure of the petunia () circadian clock in leaves and petals. We recorded the expression of 13 clock genes in petunia under light:dark (LD) and constant darkness (DD). Under light:dark conditions, clock genes reached maximum expression during the light phase in leaves and the dark period in petals. Under free running conditions of constant darkness, maximum expression was delayed, especially in petals. Interestingly, the rhythmic expression pattern of  persisted in leaves and petals in LD and DD. Gene expression variability differed among leaves and petals, time of day and photoperiod. The transcriptional noise was higher especially in leaves under constant darkness. We found that , , and  paralogs showed changes in gene structure including exon number and deletions of CCT domain of the PRR family. Our results revealed that petunia petals presented a specialized clock.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672723>Slowing down the  engine: impact of early-life corticosterone exposure on adult  in house sparrows ().</a></h1><p>Whole organism  is an integrative process that determines not only the energy cost of living but also the energy output that is available for behavioral and physiological processes during the life cycle. Developmental challenge is known to affect growth, development of several organs, and several physiological mechanisms (such as HPA responsiveness, oxidative stress or immunity), which may altogether affect adult . All these developmental effects are likely to be mediated by glucocorticoids but the impact of developmental glucocorticoid exposure on adult  has rarely been studied and the results are equivocal. In this study, we examined the impact of developmental exposure to corticosterone (CORT, the main avian glucocorticoid hormone) on RMR (resting  rate, measured in thermoneutrality, 25Â°C) and TMR (thermoregulatory  rate, measured in cold challenging condition, 5Â°C) in the House sparrow. Following experimental administration of CORT at the nestling stage, house sparrows were kept in captivity until adulthood when their  was measured. We found that post-natal CORT exposure decreased both RMR and TMR in adult sparrows. This CORT-mediated reduction of  was also associated with a reduced overnight body mass loss. Therefore, our results suggest that developmental CORT exposure can orient the phenotype towards an energy-saving strategy, which may be beneficial in a constraining environmental context.Â© 2019.

It is a unique example of an immune deficiency that is linked to dysfunctional mitochondrial energy  and caused by adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) deficiency. It is characterized by an early differentiation arrest in the myeloid lineage, impaired lymphoid maturation, and sensorineural hearing loss. In this study, a novel AK2 homozygous mutation, c.622âTâ>âC [p.Ser208Pro], was identified in an Old Order Amish patient through whole exome sequencing. Functional studies showed that the patient's cells have no detectable AK2 protein, as well as low oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and proton production rate (PPR). An increased production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane permeability, and mitochondrial mass, and decreased ATP production, were also observed. The results confirm the pathogenicity of the AK2 mutation and demonstrate that reticular dysgenesis should be considered in Amish individuals presenting with immune deficiency. We also describe other pathophysiological aspects of AK2 deficiency not previously reported.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674057>Herbal medicine in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders: A systematic review with meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>The efficacy of herbal medicines (HMs) for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD) and functional constipation (FC) is controversial. A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted to determine their effectiveness for FGIDs.We searched the following electronic databases till July 2019 with English language restriction: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE and PUBMED. Randomized double-blind controlled trials of HMs compared with placebo or conventional pharmacological drugs for adult FGIDs patients were included.In total, 49 trials involving 7396 participants with FGIDs were included. The risk of bias was low in 9, unclear in 36, and high in 4 trials. More than 33 different herbal formulae were tested. HMs demonstrated statistically significant benefits for symptom improvement compared with placebo in 46 trials (RR= 1.67, 95% CI 1.48-1.88). When compared with conventional pharmacological therapy in 5 trials, HMs were found to be non-inferior (RR= 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.18). The number of trials with regards to FD, IBS and FC were 19, 23 and 7 respectively. Subgroup analysis found that HMs were better than placebo in alleviating symptoms for FD (RR= 1.50, 95% CI 1.32-1.69), IBS (RR= 1.62, 95% CI 1.32-1.97) and FC (RR= 3.83, 95% CI 2.26-6.50). HMs tended to have more patients with adverse events than placebo, but similar to conventional pharmacological drugs.Our findings provide a positive signal for HMs as a potentially well-tolerated and effective treatment for FGIDs, deserving further examination in high-quality trials.This article is protected by copyright.

In the present study, pyriproxyfen was used as a pivot/template to search the database of the Maybridge Database for potential inhibitors of the enzymes acetylcholinesterase and juvenile hormone as well. The initial virtual screening based on the 3D shape resulted in 2000 molecules with Tanimoto index ranging from 0.58-0.88. A new reclassification was performed on the overlapping of positive and negative charges, which resulted in 100 molecules with Tanimoto's electrostatic score ranging from 0.627-0.87. Using parameters related to Absorption, Distribution,  and Excretion and the pivot molecule, the molecules selected in the previous stage were evaluated regarding these criteria, and 21 were then selected. The pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties were considered and for 12 molecules the DEREK software not fired any alert of toxicity, which were thus considered satisfactory for prediction of biological activity using the web server PASS.

CRPC is characterized by alterations in the expression levels of steroidgenic enzymes that enable the tumour to derive potent androgens from circulating adrenal androgen precursors. Intratumoral androgen biosynthesis leads to the localized production of both canonical androgens such as 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as well as less well characterized 11-oxygenated androgens, which until recently have been overlooked in the context of CRPC. In this review we discuss the contribution of both canonical and 11-oxygenated androgen precursors to the intratumoral androgen pool in CRPC. We present evidence that CRPC remains androgen dependent and discuss the alterations in steroidogenic enzyme expression and how these affect the various  to intratumoral androgen biosynthesis.

Growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota can interfere with chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant drugs, used in the treatment of these diseases, reducing or facilitating drug efficacy. In particular, the effect of intestinal microflora through translocation, immunomodulation, , enzymatic degradation and reduction of bacterial diversity seems to be one of the reasons of interindividual variability in the therapeutic response. Although the extent of the role of intestinal microflora in chemotherapy and immunosuppression remains still unresolved, current evidence on bacterial compositional shifts will be taken in consideration together with clinical response to drugs for a better and personalized therapy.

Due to its pathological similarities to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), such as Î²-amyloid deposition, oxidative stress, inflammation, disordered glucose , impaired signaling  of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), we speculate that AD is another form of brain diabetes. Clarifying the relationship between T2DM and AD is important for us to better understand the exact pathological mechanisms of AD. Silibinin, a polyphenolic flavonoid extracted from the seeds of Silybum marianum, exerts hepatoprotective, anti- diabetic and neuroprotective effects. Streptozotocin (STZ), which is used to disrupt the insulin signal transduction pathway, could well mimic the sporadic AD models by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. Therefore, we selected ICV injection of STZ (ICV-STZ) to investigate the neuroprotective effects of silibinin in rats and to make a foundation for further exploring the relationship between AD and T2DM. ICV-STZ obviously caused memory damage, sharply reduced the number of nissl bodies and destroyed morphological structure of hippocampal neuronal cells, while silibinin attenuated the damages. Moreover, silibinin significantly decreased STZ-induced tau hyperphosphorylation (ser404) in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, markedly inhibited apoptosis of neurons induced by STZ, and up-regulated insulin signal transduction pathway. Silibinin exerts neuroprotective effect in STZ-treated rats, indicating the potential of silibinin for the treatment of AD patients with T2DM in future.Copyright Â© 2019.

Citrulline has several therapeutic and clinical implications as it produces nitric oxide via arginine. In plants, citrulline plays a pivotal role in nitrogen transport and osmoprotection. The purpose of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with citrulline  using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and understand the role of citrulline in watermelon domestication. A watermelon collection consisting of 187 wild, landraces, and cultivated accessions was used to estimate citrulline content. An association analysis involved a total of 12,125 SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF)â>0.05 in understanding the population structure and phylogeny in light of citrulline accumulation. Wild egusi types and landraces contained low to medium citrulline content, whereas cultivars had higher content, which suggests that obtaining higher content of citrulline is a domesticated trait. GWAS analysis identified candidate genes ( and  ) showing a significant association of SNPs with citrulline content. Haplotype networking indicated positive selection from wild to domesticated watermelon. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing genetic regulation of citrulline variation in plants by using a GWAS strategy. These results provide new insights into the citrulline  in plants and the possibility of incorporating high citrulline as a trait in watermelon breeding programs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672355>Lipid  response to polystyrene particles in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h1><p>Nanoplastics can be used in various fields, such as personal care products. Nevertheless, the effect of nanoplastic exposure on  and its association with stress response remain largely unclear. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as an animal model, we determined the effect of nanopolystyrene exposure on lipid  and its association with the response to nanopolystyrene. Exposure (from L1-larave to adult day-3) to 100â¯nm nanopolystyrene (â¥1â¯Î¼g/L) induced severe lipid accumulation and increase in expressions of mdt-15 and sbp-1 encoding two lipid  sensors. Meanwhile, we found that SBP-1 acted downstream of intestinal MDT-15 during the control of response to nanopolystyrene. Intestinal transcriptional factor SBP-1 activated two downstream targets, fatty acyl CoA desaturase FAT-6 and heat-shock protein HSP-4 (a marker of endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (ER UPR)) to regulate nanopolystyrene toxicity. Both MDT-15 and SBP-1 were involved in the activation of ER-UPR in nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes. Moreover, SBP-1 regulated the innate immune response by activating FAT-6 in nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes. In the intestine, function of MDT-15 and SBP-1 in regulating nanopolystyrene toxicity was under the control of upstream signaling cascade (PMK-1-SKN-1) in p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Therefore, our data raised an important molecular basis for potential protective function of lipid  response in nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Insulin, which is produced by Î²-pancreatic cells, is a chief orchestrator of glucose , regulating its consumption within cells, which leads to energy generation or storage as glycogen. Abnormally lower insulin secretion from Î²-cells, insulin insensitivity, and insulin tolerance lead to higher plasma glucose levels, resulting in  complications. The last century has witnessed extraordinary efforts by the scientific community to develop anti-diabetic drugs, and these efforts yielded the discovery of exogenous insulin and various classes of oral anti-diabetic drugs.Despite these exhaustive anti-diabetic pharmaceutical and therapeutic efforts, long-term glycemic control, hypoglycemic crisis, safety issues, large-scale economic burden, side effects remain core problems.The last decade has witnessed the development of various new classes of anti-diabetic drugs with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profiles.

Six patients underwent [F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG, glucose ). We assessed imaging findings at the individual patient level, and in group-level comparisons with modality-specific groups of cognitively normal older adults (CN). Tau-PET findings in patients with TES were also compared to a matched group of patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD).All patients with TES sustained repetitive head injury participating in impact sports, ten in American football. Three patients met criteria for dementia and eight had mild cognitive impairment. Two patients were amyloid-PET positive and harbored the most severe MRI atrophy, FDG hypometabolism, and FTP-tau PET binding. Among the nine amyloid-negative patients, tau-PET showed either mildly elevated frontotemporal binding, a "dot-like" pattern, or no elevated binding. Medial temporal FTP was mildly elevated in a subset of amyloid-negative patients, but values were considerably lower than in AD. Voxelwise analyses revealed a convergence of imaging abnormalities (higher FTP binding, lower FDG, lower gray matter volumes) in frontotemporal areas in TES compared to controls.Mildly elevated tau-PET binding was observed in a subset of amyloid-negative patients at risk for CTE, in a distribution consistent with CTE pathology stages III-IV. FTP-PET may be useful as a biomarker of tau pathology in CTE but is unlikely to be sensitive to early disease stages.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

PUFA levels are influenced by nutrition and genetic factors. The relationship between PUFA composition in red blood cells (RBCs) and genetic variations involved in PUFA  has not been investigated in children with obesity. This study evaluated the association between several genetic variations and PUFA levels in RBCs in children with obesity. One hundred ninety-six children with obesity (101 females, 95 males) were evaluated using anthropometric measurements, dietary intakes, plasma and RBC PUFA quantification, blood biochemistry, and 55 single nucleotide polymorphisms within 14 genes. phosphatidylethanolamine -methyltransferase () rs1109859 and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene () rs4846052 genotypes were associated with PUFA levels in RBCs. PUFA intake did not influence the RBC eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels.

Asc's ability to reduce metals makes it an essential enzyme co-factor. Recent Advances: The ability of Asc to act as a reductant also plays an important part in its overall role in iron , where Asc induces both non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) and transferrin-bound iron uptake at physiological concentrations (~ 50 ÂµM). Moreover, Asc has emerged to play an important role in multiple diseases and its effects at pharmacological doses could be important for their treatment.Ascorbate's role as a regulator of cellular iron  along with its cytotoxic effects and different roles at pharmacological concentrations makes it a candidate as an anti-cancer agent. Ever since the controversy regarding the studies from the Mayo Clinic were finally explained, there has been a renewed interest in using Asc as a therapeutic approach towards cancer due to its minimal side effects. Numerous studies have been able to demonstrate the anti-cancer activity of Asc through selective oxidative stress towards cancer cells via H2O2-generation at pharmacological concentrations. Studies have demonstrated that Asc's cytotoxic mechanism at concentrations (>1 mM) has been associated with decreased cellular iron uptake.Recent studies have also suggested other mechanisms, such as Asc's effects on autophagy, polyamine , the cell cycle, etc. Clearly, more has yet to be discovered about Asc's mechanism of action to facilitate safe and effective treatment options for cancer and other diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670839>Disrupted hepatic pentose phosphate pathway directly participates in and indirectly promotes cyp3a-reduction: a new strategy for cyp3a-mediated drug hepatotoxicity.</a></h1><p>Hepatic CYP450s play an important role in drug-induced hepatotoxicity. They are altered not only in liver diseases but in many non-liver diseases, such as extra-hepatic tumours. Consequently, CYP450-mediated abnormal drug exposure increases the incidence and extent of hepatotoxicity. However, people often underestimate this risk because the mechanisms underlying hepatic CYP450s reduction in extra-hepatic tumours remain unclear.To avoid additional influences of chemical carcinogenesis inducers used in spontaneous tumour mouse models on hepatic CYP450s, we chose mice with subcutaneously transplanted tumours to model extra-hepatic tumours. CYP3A reduction was evaluated by qPCR, western blotting and  activity. LC-Q/TOF-MS and GC-MS were used in combination for analysing liver metabolomics. The contribution of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to CYP3A reduction was investigated by chemical interfering and silencing of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.CYP3A was already inhibited at the early stage of tumour growth when no significant inflammatory response was observed yet. The PPP was predominately disrupted at this non-inflammatory stage. On one hand, the disrupted PPP directly inhibited CYP3A through chk2/p53/p65 pathway at the non-inflammatory stage; on the other hand, it indirectly strengthened the subsequent IL-6-mediated CYP3A reduction at the inflammatory stage. Through PPP recovery with menadione in the non-inflammatory stage, CYP3A reduction could be reversed, which was comparable to that of IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab. This PPP modulation strategy to alleviate CYP3A-mediated drug hepatotoxicity was validated with dasatinib in vivo.PPP modulation at the non-inflammatory stage might provide a novel and distinctive approach to manage CYP3A-mediated drug hepatotoxicity.This article is protected by copyright.

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty acids (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major  controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like  condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright Â© 2019.

The differential expression of proteins was evaluated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Approximately, 1098 proteins were spotted, amongst which 107 proteins were observed to be statistically significant with differential expression. The functional categorization of the differential proteins illustrated that they were involved in biotic/abiotic stress (18%), energy and carbon  (11%), photosynthesis (46%), protein biosynthesis (10%), chaperoning (5%), chlorophyll (5%) and polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis (5%).

Therefore, autophagy represents a pro-survival stress response in the majority of cases. However, the role of autophagy in cell survival and cell death decisions is highly dependent on its extent, duration, and on the respective cellular context. An alternative pro-death function of autophagy has been consistently observed in different settings, in particular, in developmental cell death of lower organisms and in drug-induced cancer cell death. This cell death is referred to as autophagic cell death (ACD) or autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD), a type of cellular demise that may act as a backup cell death program in apoptosis-deficient tumors. This pro-death function of autophagy may be exerted either via non-selective bulk autophagy or excessive (lethal) removal of mitochondria via selective mitophagy, opening new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of autophagy/mitophagy in cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672356>Low endogenous NO levels in roots and antioxidant systems are determinants for the resistance of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in Cd.</a></h1><p>Cadmium (Cd), which is a toxic non-essential heavy metal capable of entering plants and thus the food chain, constitutes a major environmental and health concern worldwide. An understanding of the tools used by plants to overcome Cd stress could lead to the production of food crops with lower Cd uptake capacity and of plants with greater Cd uptake potential for phytoremediation purposes in order to restore soil efficiency in self-sustaining ecosystems. The signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO), whose function remains unclear, has recently been involved in responses to Cd stress. Using different mutants, such as nia1nia2, nox1, argh1-1 and Atnoa1, which were altered in NO , we analysed various parameters related to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS)  and seedling fitness following germination and growth under Cd treatment conditions for seven days. Seedling roots were the most affected, with an increase in ROS and RNS observed in wild type (WT) seedling roots, leading to increased oxidative damage and fitness loss. Mutants that showed lower NO levels in seedling roots under Cd stress were more resistant than WT seedlings due to the maintenance of antioxidant systems which protect against oxidative damage.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study using sodium glutamate, lipopolysaccharide, and cigarette smoke extract, we simulated lipid  disorders, obesity, hyperglycemia, and pulmonary emphysema (comorbidity) in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We assessed the gender-specific impact of lipid  disorders and pulmonary emphysema on angiogenic precursor cells (endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, cells of the lumen of the nascent vessel), as well as the biological effects of pegylated glucagon-like peptide 1 (pegGLP-1) in this experimental paradigm. Simulation of MetS/COPD comorbidity caused an accumulation of EPC (CD45CD31CD34), pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells in the lungs of female mice. In contrast, the number of cells involved in the angiogenesis decreased in the lungs of male animals. PegGLP-1 had a positive effect on lipids and area under the curve (AUC), obesity, and prevented the development of pulmonary emphysema. The severity of these effects was stronger in males than in females. Furthermore, PegGLP-1 stimulated regeneration of pulmonary endothelium. At the same time, PegGLP-1 administration caused a mobilization of EPC (CD45CD31CD34) into the bloodstream in females and migration of precursors of angiogenesis and vascular smooth muscle cells to the lungs in male animals. Gender differences in stimulatory action of pegGLP-1 on CD31 endothelial lung cells in vitro were not observed. Based on these findings, we postulated that the cellular mechanism of in vivo regeneration of lung epithelium was at least partly gender-specific. Thus, we concluded that a pegGLP-1-based treatment regime for  disorder and COPD should be further developed primarily for male patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672578>Amlexanox reversed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through IKKÎµ inhibition of hepatic stellate cell.</a></h1><p>Amlexanox, an inhibitor of nuclear factor ÎºB kinase epsilon (IKKÎµ) and TANK-binding kinase 1(TBK1), was demonstrated to be effective in diabetes and obesity. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of its role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).NAFLD mouse models were established by using eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or (and) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 weeks. From the beginning of HFD, HFD-induced mice were subjected to amlexanox or vehicle for 18 weeks. HFD+LPS-induced mice were treated with amlexanox or vehicle for the last 6 weeks. Blood biochemistry parameters were determined using automatic biochemistry analyzer. Histological changes of liver tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Oil Red O staining. The expressions of IKKÎµ and smooth muscle actin-Î± (Î±-SMA) were evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Serum inflammatory mediator was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expressions involved in glucose and lipid , insulin signaling pathway were examined using quantitative RT-PCR or Western blotting.This study demonstrated that amlexanox reversed glucose and lipid  disturbance and hepatic steatosis in NAFLD mice model. IKKÎµ was specific expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) instead of hepatocytes. This study also found that amlexanox improved insulin signaling (Insulin-IRS-1-Akt) in hepatocytes through inhibiting inflammation (IKKÎµ-NF-ÎºB-TNF-Î±/IL-1Î±) in HSCs.The present study confirmed that IKKÎµ was specific expressed in HSCs. Inhibition of activated HSCs was responsible for effects of amlexanox on NAFLD, with improving insulin signal pathway in hepatocytes.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the possibility of enhancing a whole cell based antibacterial library screen by increasing the dimensionality of the screening effort is explored using methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as the target organism. One dimension involved generating and screening a human liver microsome metabolized FDA approved drug library. Comparative screening of the un-metabolized (UM) and pre-metabolized (PM) libraries allows identification of intrinsically active agents from the UM library screen, and of agents with active metabolites from the PM library screen. To further enhance this screening effort, it was combined with a -/+ resistant to antibiotic screen (-/+ cefoxitin; Cef). This allows the identification of agents that can act synergistically with the resistant to antibiotic. This approach revealed 5 compounds with substantially improved activity after , and 4 compounds with substantial synergistic activity with cefoxitin. Capecitabine in particular only had significant antibacterial activity after . Its metabolites were isolated, identified and characterized for spectrum of activity along with several other anticancer drugs with anti-MRSA activity. Floxuridine, gemcitabine, novobiocin and rifaximin were identified as having substantial synergy with cefoxitin from the -/+ Cef screens. Checkerboard assays verified synergy for these agents. Floxuridine demonstrated a particularly high degree of synergy with cefoxitin (FIC=0.14). This study demonstrates how a dimensionally enhanced comparative screening effort can identify new antibacterial agents and strategies for countering antibacterial agent resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673306>A meta-analysis of two high-risk prospective cohort studies reveals autism-specific transcriptional changes to chromatin, autoimmune, and environmental response genes in umbilical cord blood.</a></h1><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects more than 1% of children in the USA. ASD risk is thought to arise from both genetic and environmental factors, with the perinatal period as a critical window. Understanding early transcriptional changes in ASD would assist in clarifying disease pathogenesis and identifying biomarkers. However, little is known about umbilical cord blood gene expression profiles in babies later diagnosed with ASD compared to non-typically developing and non-ASD (Non-TD) or typically developing (TD) children.Genome-wide transcript levels were measured by Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 array in RNA from cord blood samples from both the Markers of Autism Risk in Babies-Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) and the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) high-risk pregnancy cohorts that enroll younger siblings of a child previously diagnosed with ASD. Younger siblings were diagnosed based on assessments at 36âmonths, and 59 ASD, 92 Non-TD, and 120 TD subjects were included. Using both differential expression analysis and weighted gene correlation network analysis, gene expression between ASD and TD, and between Non-TD and TD, was compared within each study and via meta-analysis.While cord blood gene expression differences comparing either ASD or Non-TD to TD did not reach genome-wide significance, 172 genes were nominally differentially expressed between ASD and TD cord blood (log(fold change)â>â0.1, â<â0.01). These genes were significantly enriched for functions in xenobiotic , chromatin regulation, and systemic lupus erythematosus (FDR â<â0.05). In contrast, 66 genes were nominally differentially expressed between Non-TD and TD, including 8 genes that were also differentially expressed in ASD. Gene coexpression modules were significantly correlated with demographic factors and cell type proportions.ASD-associated gene expression differences identified in this study are subtle, as cord blood is not the main affected tissue, it is composed of many cell types, and ASD is a heterogeneous disorder.This is the first study to identify gene expression differences in cord blood specific to ASD through a meta-analysis across two prospective pregnancy cohorts. The enriched gene  support involvement of environmental, immune, and epigenetic mechanisms in ASD etiology.Â© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671511>Label-Free Quantitative Acetylome Analysis Reveals  Genotype-Specific Acetylomic Signatures.</a></h1><p>Distinct genotypic and pathogenic differences exist between  genotypes. For example, genotype I is highly virulent, whereas genotype II and genotype III are less virulent. Moreover, Chinese 1 genotype (ToxoDB#9) is also virulent. Here, we compare the acetylomes of genotype 1 (RH strain) and Chinese 1 genotype (ToxoDB#9, PYS strain) of . Using mass spectrometry enriched for acetylated peptides, we found a relationship between the levels of protein acetylation and parasite genotype-specific virulence. Notably, lysine acetylation was the largest (458 acetylated proteins) in RH strain, followed by PYS strain (188 acetylated proteins), whereas only 115 acetylated proteins were detected in PRU strain. Our analysis revealed four, three, and four motifs in RH strain, PRU strain and PYS strain, respectively. Three conserved sequences around acetylation sites, namely, xxxxxKHxxxx, xxxxxKFxxxx, and xxxxGKSxxxx, were detected in the acetylome of the three strains. However, xxxxxKNxxxx (asparagine) was found in RH and PYS strains but was absent in PRU strain. Our analysis also identified 15, 3, and 26 differentially expressed acetylated proteins in RH strain vs. PRU strain, PRU strain vs. PYS strain and PYS strain vs. RH strain, respectively. KEGG pathway analysis showed that a large proportion of the acetylated proteins are involved in  processes.  for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, biosynthesis of antibiotics and microbial  in diverse environments were featured in the top five enriched  in all three strains. However, acetylated proteins from the virulent strains (RH and PYS) were more enriched in the pyruvate  pathway compared to acetylated proteins from PRU strain. Increased levels of histone-acetyl-transferase and glycyl-tRNA synthase were detected in RH strain compared to PRU strain and PYS strain. Both enzymes play roles in stress tolerance and proliferation, key features in the parasite virulence. These findings reveal novel insight into the acetylomic profiles of major  genotypes and provide a new important resource for further investigations of the roles of the acetylated parasite proteins in the modulation of the host cell response to the infection of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670380>Metabolomics study of fasudil on cisplatin-induced kidney injury.</a></h1><p>Fasudil is a derivative of 5-isoquinoline sulfonamide, which is a Rho kinase inhibitor, a wide range of pharmacological effects. Fasudil has been shown to attenuate kidney injury caused by certain substances. In the present study, metabolomic analysis of mouse kidney tissues ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to determine the metabolomic changes in cisplatin-induced kidney injury and the fasudil-induced attenuation of cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Metabolomic profiling of kidney tissues revealed significant differences in metabolites between the control group and the cisplatin group and between the cisplatin group and the fasudil-intervention group. With metabolomic approach, 68 endogenous differential metabolites were found, and multivariate statistical analysis, accurate molecular weights, isotope tracers, mass-spectrometry secondary-fragment information, and standard-reference comparisons were used to identify these substances. Based on these differential metabolites, a -pathway network was constructed and revealed that fasudil primarily attenuated cisplatin-induced renal injury by modulating lipid and amino-acid . These results further demonstrate that kidney injury can be induced by cisplatin and, moreover, suggest that fasudil can be used to reduce kidney injury at early stages in patients treated with cisplatin.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669996>Variable carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation in TCE co- oxidation.</a></h1><p>Identifying co- TCE oxidation in polluted groundwater is challenging due to lack of indicative by-products. This challenge may theoretically be resolved if the oxidation process can be characterized by a distinct dual isotope enrichment. In this work, we aimed to explore the carbon and chlorine isotope effects associated with TCE oxidation by a variety of oxygenases. These included pure strains and enrichment cultures of methane, toluene and ammonia oxidizers, as well as experiments with crude extracts. Isotope effects determined for TCE oxidation by toluene and ammonia oxidizers were mostly in line with expected values for epoxidation mechanism (ÏµCÂ -11.0â¯Â±â¯0.7 toÂ -24.8â¯Â±â¯0.2â° and ÏµClÂ +0.9Â Â±Â 0.5 toÂ +1.0Â Â±Â 0.4â°), whereas, the methanotrophs resulted in distinctively different isotope effects (ÏµCÂ -2.4â¯Â±â¯0.4 toÂ -3.4â¯Â±â¯0.8â° and ÏµClÂ -1.8â¯Â±â¯0.2 toÂ -2.9â¯Â±â¯0.9â°). It is suggested that in TCE oxidation by methanotrophs, substrate binding rather than bond cleavage is rate limiting, leading to this unexpected isotope effect. On the environmental level, our results imply that the oxidative process can be differentiated if catalyzed by toluene and ammonia oxidizers or by methanotrophs. Additionally, the oxidative process can be distinguished from the reductive one. However, using dual isotope analysis in the field may result in an under-estimation of the overall co- process if methanotrophs are to be excluded due to low isotope effects.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the differential and tissue specific proteolytic processing of the glucagon precursor and the presence in of several glucagon-like sequences, not only in the precursor of glucagon, but also in a number of other peptides of the glucagon-secretin family of peptides, put special demands on the specificity of the assays. Finally, experience has shown that unspecific interference of plasma components has presented additional problems. All of these problems have resulted in a lot of diverging results concerning measured and reported glucagon responses in both humans and experimental animals that have and still are causing considerable debate and controversy. There is very solid evidence that glucagon is an important hormone in human and mammalian , but its precise physiological role in glucose and lipid  and in  disease has been difficult to establish, not least because of these difficulties. It was our purpose with this review to discuss the methods of glucagon quantification and discuss pitfalls and sources of error.

Their activities are primarily based on the binding to the GC receptor (GR), a member of the nuclear receptor family, that regulates tissue-specific sets of genes. GCs secretion follows a circadian rhythmicity with a peak linked to the animal's activity phase. In mammals, GCs are also implicated in feeding entrainment mechanisms as internal zeitgeber. Here, we investigated, by means of behavioural and molecular approaches, the circadian clock and its regulation by light and food in wild-type (WT) and null glucocorticoid receptor (gr) zebrafish larvae, juveniles and adults. In both WT and gr larvae and adults, behavioural activity and clock gene expression were entrained to the light-dark (LD) cycle and rhythmic in constant conditions. Differences in the pattern of clock genes' expression indicated a modulatory role of GCs. A significant role of Gr was detected in the feeding entrainment which was absent or markedly dampened in mutants. Furthermore, the expression of two clock-regulated genes involved in glucidic and lipidic  was altered, highlighting the participation of GCs in  processes also in fish. Taken together, our results confirmed the role of GC-mediated Gr signaling in the feeding entrainment in a non-mammalian species, the zebrafish.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673919>The actinobacterium Tsukamurella paurometabola has a functionally divergent arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) homolog.</a></h1><p>Actinobacteria in the Tsukamurella genus are aerobic, high-GC, Gram-positive mycolata, considered as opportunistic pathogens and isolated from various environmental sources, including sites contaminated with oil, urban or industrial waste and pesticides. Although studies look into xenobiotic biotransformation by Tsukamurella isolates, the relevant enzymes remain uncharacterized. We investigated the arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzyme family, known for its role in the xenobiotic  of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Xenobiotic sensitivity of Tsukamurella paurometabola type strain DSM 20162 was assessed, followed by cloning, recombinant expression and functional characterization of its single NAT homolog (TSUPD)NAT1. The bacterium appeared quite robust against chloroanilines, but more sensitive to 4-anisidine and 2-aminophenol. However,  activity was not evident towards those compounds, presumably due to mechanisms protecting cells from xenobiotic entry. Of the pharmaceutical arylhydrazines tested, hydralazine was toxic, but the bacterium was less sensitive to isoniazid, a drug targeting mycolic acid biosynthesis in mycobacteria. Although (TSUPD)NAT1 protein has an atypical Cys-His-Glu (instead of the expected Cys-His-Asp) catalytic triad, it is enzymatically active, suggesting that this deviation is likely due to evolutionary adaptation potentially serving a different function. The protein was indeed found to use malonyl-CoA, instead of the archetypal acetyl-CoA, as its preferred donor substrate. Malonyl-CoA is important for microbial biosynthesis of fatty acids (including mycolic acids) and polyketide chains, and the corresponding enzymatic systems have common evolutionary histories, also linked to xenobiotic . This study adds to accummulating evidence suggesting broad phylogenetic and functional divergence of microbial NAT enzymes that goes beyond xenobiotic  and merits investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673528>Genetic Study of Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Alpha Variants in Development of Early-Onset Diabetes Type 2 and Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young 3 in Iran.</a></h1><p>Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diabetes characterized by noninsulin-dependent, autosomal-dominant disorder with strong familial history, early age of onset, and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Mutations in at least 14 different genes are responsible for various MODY subtypes. Heterozygous mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha () gene are responsible for the MODY3 subtype, which is a common subtype of MODY in different studied populations. To date, more than 450 different variants of this gene have been reported as disease causing for MODY3. This study was carried out to evaluate  mutations in Iranian diabetic families fulfilling MODY criteria.Polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing were performed. All the ten exons of the  gene were sequenced in ten families, followed by cosegregation analysis and  evaluation. Computational protein modeling was accomplished for the identified mutation.MODY3 was confirmed in two large families by detecting a mutation (p.G253E) in coding regions of . Compound heterozygous state for two common variants in  (p.I27 L and p.S487N) was detected in affected members of 5 families, and in one family, a rare benign variant in the coding sequence for Kozak sequence was detected.

Consensus was considered reached if â¥75% agreed or disagreed.Consensus was reached on 55 statements. The main goals of surveillance (to identify high-grade dysplastic precursor lesions and T1N0M0 pancreatic cancer) remained unchanged. Experts agreed that for those with familial risk, surveillance should start no earlier than age 50 or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer, but were split on whether to start at age 50 or 55. Germline  mutation carriers with one affected first-degree relative are now considered eligible for surveillance. Experts agreed that preferred surveillance tests are endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/magnetic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, but no consensus was reached on how to alternate these modalities. Annual surveillance is recommended in the absence of concerning lesions. Main areas of disagreement included if and how surveillance should be performed for hereditary pancreatitis, and the management of indeterminate lesions.Pancreatic surveillance is recommended for selected high-risk individuals to detect early pancreatic cancer and its high-grade precursors, but should be performed in a research setting by multidisciplinary teams in centres with appropriate expertise. Until more evidence supporting these recommendations is available, the benefits, risks and costs of surveillance of pancreatic surveillance need additional evaluation.Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In an effort towards improving our understanding of this process, we sought to challenge convention and examine how the source, amount and site of NPN delivery in the gastrointestinal tract of the ruminant may affect fibre digestibility, rumen stability and N . In the first study presented here, we used four ruminally cannulated non-lactating heifers in a Latin square design to infuse 59Â g/days of N in the form of ammonia (A) or urea (U) into either the rumen (R) or the abomasum (A). We found that intake was higher (pÂ =Â .03) for animals receiving supplementary NPN as urea compared with ammonia. In addition, abomasally infused urea (UA) improved fibre fermentation by 9.4% (pÂ =Â .05) and decreased ruminal pH fluctuations (lower slope in the cumulative pH parameters, pÂ =Â .04) when compared with the same amount of urea infused ruminally (UR). In a second study, using the same group of heifers, we infused 50 or 150Â g/day of urea into the rumen (UR50 and UR150) or 150Â g of urea in the abomasum (UA150) or 50Â g in the rumen and 100Â g in the abomasum (URA150). Fibre digestion was improved by 4% (pÂ =Â .02) when the same dose of urea was infused into the abomasum compared with the rumen, while estimated microbial protein production and N efficiency were not different between a low rumen dose and high post-ruminal dose of urea. Collectively, these studies provide insight into the viability of post-ruminal NPN supplementation as a strategy to improve fibre digestion and NPN inclusion in the ruminant diet.Â© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673065>Analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana Redox Gene Network Indicates Evolutionary Expansion of Class III Peroxidase in Plants.</a></h1><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are byproducts of aerobic  and may cause oxidative damage to biomolecules. Plants have a complex redox system, involving enzymatic and non-enzymatic compounds. The evolutionary origin of enzymatic antioxidant defense in plants is yet unclear. Here, we describe the redox gene network for A. thaliana and investigate the evolutionary origin of this network. We gathered from public repositories 246 A. thaliana genes directly involved with ROS  and proposed an A. thaliana redox gene network. Using orthology information of 238 Eukaryotes from STRINGdb, we inferred the evolutionary root of each gene to reconstruct the evolutionary history of A. thaliana antioxidant gene network. We found two interconnected clusters: one formed by SOD-related, Thiol-redox, peroxidases, and other oxido-reductase; and the other formed entirely by class III peroxidases. Each cluster emerged in different periods of evolution: the cluster formed by SOD-related, Thiol-redox, peroxidases, and other oxido-reductase emerged before opisthokonta-plant divergence; the cluster composed by class III peroxidases emerged after opisthokonta-plant divergence and therefore contained the most recent network components.

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile acids (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic acid, activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670618>Metformin: Up to Date.</a></h1><p>Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent extensively used as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes.

Protein deimination is an irreversible post-translational modification caused by the peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) family of enzymes, which convert arginine into citrulline in target proteins. Protein deimination can cause structural and functional protein changes, facilitating protein moonlighting, but also leading to neo-epitope generation and effects on gene regulation. Furthermore, PADs have been found to regulate cellular release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are lipid-vesicles released from cells as part of cellular communication. EVs carry protein and genetic cargo and are indicative biomarkers that can be isolated from most body fluids. This study was aimed at profiling deiminated proteins in plasma and EVs of naked mole-rat. Key immune and  proteins were identified to be post-translationally deiminated, with 65 proteins specific for plasma, while 42 proteins were identified to be deiminated in EVs only. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis, deiminated plasma proteins were found to belong to KEEG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)  of immunity, infection, cholesterol and drug , while deiminated proteins in EVs were also linked to KEEG  of HIF-1 signalling and glycolysis. The mole-rat EV profiles showed a poly-dispersed population of 50-300 nm, similar to observations of human plasma. Furthermore, the EVs were assessed for three key microRNAs involved in cancer, inflammation and hypoxia. The identification of post-translational deimination of critical immunological and  markers contributes to the current understanding of protein moonlighting functions, via post-translational changes, in the longevity and cancer resistance of naked mole-rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673107>Structure Based Multitargeted Molecular Docking Analysis of Selected Furanocoumarins against Breast Cancer.</a></h1><p>Breast cancer is one of the biggest global dilemmas and its current therapy is to target the hormone receptors by the use of partial agonists/antagonists. Potent drugs for breast cancer treatment are Tamoxifen, Trastuzumab, Paclitaxel, etc. which show adverse effects and resistance in patients. The aim of the study has been on certain phytochemicals which has potent actions on ERÎ±, PR, EGFR and mTOR inhibition. The current study is performed by the use of molecular docking as protein-ligand interactions play a vital role in drug design. The 3D structures of ERÎ±, PR, EGFR and mTOR were obtained from the protein data bank and docked with 23 3D PubChem structures of furanocoumarin compounds using FlexX. Drug-likeness property was checked by applying the Lipinski's rule of five on the furanocoumarins to evaluate anti-breast cancer activity. Antagonist and inhibition assay of ERÎ±, EGFR and mTOR respectively has been performed using appropriate in-vitro techniques. The results confirm that Xanthotoxol has the best docking score for breast cancer followed by Bergapten, Angelicin, Psoralen and Isoimperatorin. Further, the in-vitro results also validate the molecular docking analysis. This study suggests that the selected furanocoumarins can be further investigated and evaluated for breast cancer treatment and management strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675589>Effects of cadmium on intestinal histology and microbiota in freshwater crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).</a></h1><p>In this study, Procambarus clarkii (P.Â clarkii) were exposed to different concentrations (0, 2, 5 and 10â¯mg/L) of cadmium (Cd). We studied the effects of Cd exposure on intestinal histology and microbiota in P.Â clarkii. The results demonstrated that exposure to Cd caused histological alterations in the intestines of P.Â clarkii. Meanwhile, high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that Cd exposure could alter the richness, diversity, and composition of intestinal microbiota in P.Â clarkii. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of the prevalent phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria changed significantly after exposure to Cd. At the genus level, the most prevalent genera with significant difference in relative abundance were Bacteroides, Clostridium XlVb, Hafnia, Buttiauxella, Shewanella, Anaerorhabdus, Alistipes, Arcobacter, Azoarcus, Chryseobacterium, and so on. Furthermore, functional prediction analysis of intestinal microbial communities showed that Cd exposure could significantly alter the  related to , diseases, cellular processes, and so on. Taken together, exposure to Cd could induce intestinal histological damage and affect intestinal microbiota composition and functions of P.Â clarkii. Our study can be an important step toward a better understanding of the toxic effects of Cd on aquatic crustaceans.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of potential CYP interactions referring to the most clinically relevant drugs and exploring the relationship between them and quality of life and physical performance in Spanish octogenarians. Institutionalized and community-dwelling octogenarians ( = 102) treated at three primary care centers, were recruited by a research nurse. Anthropometric measurements, chronic diseases, prescribed drugs, quality of life, physical performance, mobility skills, hand grip strength and cognitive status data were collected. Potential CYP drug-drug interactions (DDIs) were selected referring to the main CYP implicated in their . The 72.2% of recruited octogenarians presented potentially inappropriate CYP inhibitor-substrate or CYP inductor-substrate combinations. Analyzing the EuroQol Visual Analogue scale (EQ-VAS) results, patients with a potential CYP DDI perceived worse health status than patients without it ( = 0.004). In addition, patients with a potential CYP DDI presented worse exercise capacity, kinesthetic abilities, or mobility than those who didn't present a potential interaction ( = 0.01,  = 0.047, and  = 0.02, respectively). To investigate and control factors associated with loss of muscle strength and poor quality of life, polypharmacy and DDIs could help institutions in the management of physical frailty.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674052>Duodenal and rectal mucosal microbiota related to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in diarrhea-predominant IBS.</a></h1><p>Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been proposed as an etiologic factor in irritable bowel syndrome, particularly the diarrhea-predominant subtype (IBS-D). We aimed to identify potential intestinal microbial pattern in IBS-D patients with SIBO.IBS-D patients fulfilling Rome-III criteria were recruited, and randomly divided into an exploratory cohort (57 cases) and a validation cohort (20 cases). SIBO was identified according to standard glucose hydrogen breath test. For 16S-rRNA gene sequencing, samples of duodenal mucosa, duodenal fluid, rectal mucosa and fresh feces were collected and performed. The Î± and Î² diversity, as well as differences in microbial composition and function, in SIBO and SIBO IBS-D subjects were evaluated.The microbial diversity and composition obviously differed between SIBO and SIBO IBS-D in duodenal and rectal mucosa, but not in duodenal fluid and fresh feces. For rectal-mucosal microbiota, it displayed markedly reduced aerobe and Gram-negative bacteria, and increased facultative anaerobe and Gram-positive bacteria, moreover, altered functions of microbial  in SIBO IBS-D. Significantly higher rectal mucosa-related MDI was observed in SIBO IBS-D, and a cutoff value at -0.37 had a sensitivity of 56.55% and specificity of 90.91% to identify the SIBO in IBS-D subjects.Mucosal microbiota, rather than luminal bacteria, has a more apparent dysbiosis in SIBO IBS-D patients relative to those without SIBO. Rectal mucosa-associated microbiota may act as a potential predictor of SIBO in IBS-D patients.This article is protected by copyright.

However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice.Wilt-type mice fed with low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18Â mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25Â days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed.In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf-b in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio.Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF-B expression in PVAT. Inhibition of PVAT remodeling by luseogliflozin may be a novel therapeutic target for vascular remodeling after angioplasty.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670977>ATP synthase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), a novel myokine, regulates glucose  by AMPK and Akt dual .</a></h1><p>ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1) is an ATP synthase-interacting protein that suppresses the hydrolysis activity of ATP synthase. In this study, we observed that the expression of IF1 was up-regulated in response to electrical pulse stimulation of skeletal muscle cells and in exercized mice and healthy men. IF1 stimulates glucose uptake  AMPK in skeletal muscle cells and primary cultured myoblasts. Reactive oxygen species and Rac family small GTPase 1 (Rac1) function in the upstream and downstream of AMPK, respectively, in IF1-mediated glucose uptake. In diabetic animal models, the administration of recombinant IF1 improved glucose tolerance and down-regulated blood glucose level. In addition, IF1 inhibits ATP hydrolysis by Î²-F1-ATPase in plasma membrane, thereby increasing extracellular ATP and activating the protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, ultimately leading to glucose uptake. Thus, we suggest that IF1 is a novel myokine and propose a mechanism by which AMPK and Akt contribute independently to IF1-mediated improvement of glucose tolerance impairment. These results demonstrate the importance of IF1 as a potential antidiabetic agent.-Lee, H. J., Moon, J., Chung, I., Chung, J. H., Park, C., Lee, J. O., Han, J. A., Kang, M. J., Yoo, E.

[O]HO is used as a perfusion tracer, and [C]acetate as an oxidative  in this purpose, requiring two injections to assess those fundamental parameters. Yet, in cardiac physiology study, the high first-pass myocardial extraction fraction of [C]acetate allowed to use its influx rate as a blood flow marker too. Since [C]acetate has been characterized by a 20-25% single pass renal extraction in dogs, it could be used as a potential tracer for renal perfusion. The aim of this study was to determine whether [C]acetate influx rate can be used as quantitative in vivo marker of kidney perfusion in human.In 10 healthy subjects, dynamic PET acquisitions were performed after [O]HO and [C]acetate injections spaced by a 15-minute interval. As previously validated, with compartmental modeling of kinetics, renal perfusion and oxidative  were estimated respectively with influx rate of [O]HO and efflux rate of [C]acetate. Additionally, influx rate of [C]acetate was regressed to influx rate of [O]HO.Renal time activity curves of [C]-acetate was best fitted with a mono compartmental model compared to a bi-compartmental model (pâ¯<â¯0.0001). [C]acetate influx rate was significantly correlated with perfusion quantified with [O]HO (râ¯=â¯0.37, pâ¯<â¯0.001) at baseline. This regression allowed the computation of a renal [C]acetate extraction fraction (EF), and further the computation of renal blood flow from its influx rate.In healthy subjects, over a wide range of renal perfusion, direct estimates of renal oxygen consumption as well as tissue perfusion can be obtained by PET with a single tracer [C]acetate. This approach needs to be validated in CKD patients, and would be of great interest to design clinical protocol aiming at evaluating ischemic nephropathies candidate to revascularization.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3Â mg) short-term (5Â weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3Â mg or placebo for 5Â weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

However, to date, research on how ethylene affects the Chl degradation pathway of apple peel during ripening remains scarce. In this study, the effects of ethylene on the expression of Chl catabolic genes (CCGs) of apple peel during ripening were studied by treating harvested commercial mature apples with 0.5â¯Î¼Lâ¯L 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP). The results showed that 1-MCP treatment led to a delayed climacteric peak of respiration and ethylene production, exhibiting higher Chl content and hue angle (HË) compared to untreated fruit during ripening. Lower quantities of pheophorbide a oxygenase (PAO), pheophytinase (PPH) and red Chl catabolite reductase (RCCR) were also observed in peel tissues under 1-MCP treatment during ripening. Further study with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that the expression of CCGs, except for MdNYE1a, increased atdifferentdegrees upon ripening. Meanwhile, the apples treated with 1-MCP presented a downregulated expression of MdRCCR2, MdNYC1, MdNYC3 and MdNOL2 and a fluctuating expression of MdNYE1a, MdPPH1, MdPAO6, MdPAO8 and MdHCAR compared with the controls during ripening. Our results indicated the regulatory role of ethylene in the Chl degradation pathway of apple peel during ripening.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) has been reported to decrease dietary protein levels, promote intestinal health in piglets and reduce environmental pollution. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKG are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low-protein diet supplementation of AKG on the growth performance, nitrogen , relative expression of amino acid transporter genes and mTOR signalling pathway of skeletal muscle in piglets. Forty-eight piglets with an initial weight of 11.53Â Â±Â 0.04Â kg were randomly divided into four groups. Each group had four replicates, and each replicate had three pigs. A low-protein (LP) diet (crude protein was 14.96%) served as the control without AKG, while 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% AKG were added to the LP diet for the other experimental groups. The trial period lasted for 28Â days. Compared with the LP group, the LPÂ +Â 1.0%A and LPÂ +Â 1.5%A groups increased the growth performance (pÂ <Â .05);increased the mRNA levels of amino acid transporters in the duodenum, anterior jejunum and posterior jejunum (pÂ <Â .05); and reduced faecal nitrogen and urine nitrogen emissions (pÂ <Â .05). They also showed greater mRNA levels and phosphorylated protein levels for S6 kinase beta (S6K) (pÂ <Â .05), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (pÂ <Â .05) and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) (pÂ <Â .05) in skeletal muscle. An LP diet supplemented with AKG activated the mTOR signalling and promoted the ability of the small intestine to absorb protein, thereby increasing protein deposition. Taken together, an LP diet supplemented with AKG provides a theoretical basis for the promotion and application of AKG in piglet production.Â© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675417>Response to Letter to the Editor: Impaired Glucose  in Primary Aldosteronism Is Associated With Cortisol Cosecretion.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674709>Evolutionary adaptation of Aspergillus niger for increased ferulic acid tolerance.</a></h1><p>To create an Aspergillus niger mutant with increased tolerance against ferulic acid using evolutionary adaptation.Evolutionary adaptation of Aspergillus niger N402 was performed by consecutive growth on increasing concentrations of ferulic acid in the presence of 25Â mmolÂ l D-fructose, starting from 0Â·5Â mmolÂ l and ending with 5Â mmolÂ l ferulic acid. The A. niger mutant obtained after six months, named Fa6, showed increased ferulic acid tolerance compared to the parent. In addition, Fa6 has increased ferulic acid consumption and a higher conversion rate, suggesting that the mutation affects aromatic  of this species. Transcriptome analysis of the evolutionary mutant on ferulic acid revealed a distinct gene expression profile compared to the wild type. Further analysis of this mutant and the parent strain provided the first experimental confirmation that A. niger converts coniferyl alcohol to ferulic acid.The evolutionary adaptive A. niger mutant Fa6 has beneficial mutations that increase the tolerance, conversion rate and uptake of ferulic acid.This study demonstrates that evolutionary adaptation is a powerful tool to modify microorganisms towards increased tolerance to harsh conditions, which is beneficial for various industrial applications.Â© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672581>Comparative study on  profiling and excretion in rat bile between combination of notoginseng total saponins and safflower total flavonoids and its individual extracts by LC-MS/MS.</a></h1><p>The combination of notoginseng total saponins (NS) and safflower total flavonoids (SF), namely CNS, presents a synergistic protection effect on the myocardial ischemia rats. The aim of this study was to find the clues for their synergistic actions by comparing the biliary  and excretion profiles after oral administration of CNS and its individual extracts. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS) platform was used to identify and quantify the CNS-derived components in bile. The neutral losses, precursor ions, and predictive multiple reaction monitoring (pMRM) scans were firstly used to detect the CNS-derived ingredients in vivo. A total of 43 components, including 38 flavonoids and 5 ginsenosides were tentatively identified according to the previously established chemical and  profiles of NS and SF. Afterwards, the primary circulating and biological components, hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), ginsenosides Rg (GRg), Re (GRe), and Rd (GRd) were chosen to compare the bile excretion between CNS and its individual extract groups, by using a validated LC-MRM-MS/MS method. The approach was proved to be well satisfied the related requirements from the guidelines of FDA (specificity, calibration curve, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, recovery, and stability). Comparing with the SF and NS groups, the combination group did not affect the   of the CNS-related components, however, it decreased the cumulative excretion ratios of HSYA, GRg, GRe, and GRd. In conclusion, the compatibility of SF and NS could reduce the bile excretion of the CNS-derived compounds, which may be one of the reasons for the enhancement of anti-myocardial ischemia after combination.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.
