The concept of immunostimulatory activity of SA-BA is based on the activation of immune system against cancer antigen. This study showed that SA-BA, a pentacyclic triterpene isolated from the bark of the Ziziphus jujube tree, elevated the immunological functions of cancer antigen in anticancer . We found that, SA-BA pulsed human macrophages secreted elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines with an increased CD4(+) cell population. Pulse macrophages were also significantly arrested the KG-1A and K562 cell growth in vitro setup at 1:10 ratio for 48h. The use of TNF-α inhibitors confirmed the association between SA-BA with TNF-α function. SA-BA pulsed macrophages displayed substantial T cell allostimulatory capacity and promoted the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The adjuvanticity of SA-BA was proved by the generation of in vivo IgG response. Collectively, these findings will enrich the biomedical applications of SA-BA as a potent immune stimulating agent. Moreover, the macrophage stimulating efficacy of SA-BA might be an effective way in the cancer .Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

They gained a great interest in the last decades as therapeutic agents since they provide inexpensive and less toxic products than the synthetic chemotherapeutic agents. Immunomodulators are the agents that have the ability to boost or suppress the host defense response that can be used as a prophylaxis as well as in combination with other therapeutic modalities. The anticancer activity of these immunomodulators is due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and induction of apoptosis, anti-angiogenesis, and anti-metastasis effect. These natural immunomodulators such as genistein, curcumin, and resveratrol can be used as prophylaxis against the initiation of cancer besides the inhibition of tumor growth and proliferation. Whereas, immunostimulants can elicit and activate humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against the tumor that facilitate the recognition and destruction of the already existing tumor. This review represents the recent studies on various natural immunomodulators with antitumor effects. We have focused on the relationship between their anticancer activity and immunomodulatory mechanisms. The mechanisms of action of various immunomodulators such as polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, organosulfur compounds, capsaicin, vinca alkaloids, bromelain,  and zerumbone, the affected cancerous cell lines in addition to the targeted molecules and transcriptional pathways have been review and critically analyzed.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
