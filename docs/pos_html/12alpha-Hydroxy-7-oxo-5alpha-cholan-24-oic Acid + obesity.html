However, little is known about its direct impact on the liver.To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of AITC in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (commonly referred to as NAFLD).To establish a mouse and cellular model of NAFLD, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk, and AML-12 cells were treated with 200 μM palmitate  for 24 h. For AITC treatment, mice were administered AITC (100 mg/kg/d) orally and AML-12 cells were treated with AITC (20 μmol/L).AITC significantly ameliorated HFD-induced weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation . Furthermore, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were markedly reduced in AITC-treated mice. Mechanistically, AITC significantly downregulated the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its lipogenesis target genes and upregulated the levels of proteins involved in fatty  β-oxidation, as well as the upstream mediators Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), in the livers of HFD-fed mice. AITC also attenuated the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Consistently, AITC relieved palmitate -induced lipid accumulation and inflammation in AML-12 cells  through the Sirt1/AMPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Importantly, further studies showed that the curative effect of AITC on lipid accumulation was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of either Sirt1 or AMPKα in AML-12 cells.AITC significantly ameliorates hepatic steatosis and inflammation by activating the Sirt1/AMPK pathway and inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. Therefore, AITC is a potential therapeutic agent for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655133>β-Klotho gene variation is associated with liver damage in children with NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in adults and children. Along with , diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile  metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty  caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Considering this apparent contradiction and that olive oil is a complex mix of fatty , mainly oleic  and minor compounds such as phenolic compounds, lignans, hydrocarbons, and triterpenes, we study its effects on intestinal epithelial cell growth. Our results show that oleic  (1-100 μM) but not elaidic  induced DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth (2-fold higher than cells without growth factors,  < 0.05). These effects were inhibited by 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors as well as the leukotriene antagonist ( < 0.05), suggesting the implication of this pathway in this mitogenic action. Hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, pinoresinol, squalene, and maslinic  (0.1-10 μM) reverted DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth induced by oleic . These effects were not the consequence of the cell cycle arrest or the impairment of cell viability with the exception of hydroxytyrosol and maslinic  that induced cell detachment and apoptosis (35.6 ± 2.3 and 43.2 ± 2.4%, respectively) at the higher concentration assayed. Oleuropein effects can be related with hydroxytyrosol release as a consequence of oleuropein hydrolysis by Caco-2 cells (up to 25%). Furthermore, hydroxytyrosol modulates the arachidonic  cascade, and this event can be associated with its antimitogenic action. In conclusion, oleic  and oleic  in the presence of olive oil representative minor components have opposite effects, suggesting that the consumption of seed oils, high oleic  seed oils, or olive oil will probably have different effects on CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591297>Biological Evaluation of Natural and Synthesized Homovanillic  Esters as Inhibitors of Intestinal Fatty  Uptake in Differentiated Caco-2 Cells.</a></h2><p>With raising prevalence of , the regulation of human body fat is increasingly relevant. The modulation of fatty  uptake by enterocytes represents a promising target for body weight maintenance. Recent results demonstrated that the trigeminal active compounds capsaicin, nonivamide, and -pellitorine dose-dependently reduce fatty  uptake in differentiated Caco-2 cells as a model for the intestinal barrier. However, non-pungent alternatives have not been investigated and structural determinants for the modulation of intestinal fatty  uptake have not been identified so far. Thus, based on the previous results, we synthesized 23 homovanillic  esters in addition to the naturally occurring capsiate and screened them for their potential to reduce intestinal fatty  uptake using the fluorescent fatty  analog Bodipy-C12 in differentiated Caco‑2 cells as an enterocyte model. Whereas pre-incubation with 100 µM capsiate did not change fatty  uptake by Caco-2 enterocytes, a maximum inhibition of -47% was reached using 100 µM 1‑methylpentyl-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)acetate. Structural analysis of the 24 structural analogues tested in the present study revealed that a branched fatty  side chain, independent of the chain length, is one of the most important structural motifs associated with inhibition of fatty  uptake in Caco-2 enterocytes. The results of the present study may serve as an important basis for designing potent dietary inhibitors of fatty  uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577934>Dietary Sugars Alter Hepatic Fatty  Oxidation via Transcriptional and Post-translational Modifications of Mitochondrial Proteins.</a></h2><p>Dietary sugars, fructose and glucose, promote hepatic de novo lipogenesis and modify the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of insulin resistance. Here, we show that fructose and glucose supplementation of an HFD exert divergent effects on hepatic mitochondrial function and fatty  oxidation. This is mediated via three different nodes of regulation, including differential effects on malonyl-CoA levels, effects on mitochondrial size/protein abundance, and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. HFD- and HFD plus fructose-fed mice have decreased CTP1a activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty  oxidation, whereas knockdown of fructose metabolism increases CPT1a and its acylcarnitine products. Furthermore, fructose-supplemented HFD leads to increased acetylation of ACADL and CPT1a, which is associated with decreased fat metabolism. In summary, dietary fructose, but not glucose, supplementation of HFD impairs mitochondrial size, function, and protein acetylation, resulting in decreased fatty  oxidation and development of metabolic dysregulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with  had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with , muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty  concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with  had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS.

Among multiple risk factors, host intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention in T2D etiology and progression. In the present study, we have explored the effect of long-term supplementation with a non-dairy fermented food product (FFP) in Zucker Diabetic and Fatty (ZDF) rats T2D model. The supplementation with FFP induced an improvement in glucose homeostasis according to the results obtained from fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, and pancreatic function. Importantly, a significantly reduced intestinal glucose absorption was found in the FFP-treated rats. Supplemented animals also showed a greater survival suggesting a better health status as a result of the FFP intake. Some dissimilarities have been observed in the gut microbiota population between control and FFP-treated rats, and interestingly a tendency for better cardiometabolic markers values was appreciated in this group. However, no significant differences were observed in body weight, body composition, or food intake between groups. These findings suggest that FFP induced gut microbiota modifications in ZDF rats that improved glucose metabolism and protected from T2D development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640715>Upregulation of FNDC5 gene expression in C2C12 cells after single and combined treatments of resveratrol and ATRA.</a></h2><p>Irisin is a newly discovered myokine that secreted from skeletal muscle cells. Several studies showed that irisin involves in thermogenesis and increases the expression of browning markers such as uncoupling protein-1 that in turns induces the conversion of white adipose tissue to brown fat. Resveratrol (Res) and all-trans retinoic  (ATRA) can also upregulate the expression of thermogenesis genes. In the present study, the effects of single and combined treatments of Res and ATRA on fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5) gene expression was explored.The mouse myoblasts, C2C12 cells, were seeded in 6-well plastic plates and cultured in DMEM media. After differentiation, in a pilot study, C2C12 myotubes were treated with different concentrations of Res and ATRA for 12 h. The best result was obtained by treatment of 1and 25 μM of Res and 1 μM of ATRA. Then the main study was continued by single and combined treatment of these compounds at chosen concentration. After treatments, total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated by the cDNA synthesis kit and FNDC5 mRNA expression was evaluated by the real-time PCR method.The FNDC5 gene expression in C2C12 myotubes of alone-treated with 1 μM, 25 μM Res and 10 μM ATRA did not change compared to vehicle group. However, in combination-treated the expression of FNDC5 gene was significantly increased compared to vehicle group.This is the first evidence that Res and ATRA can regulate FNDC5 gene expression in C2C12 myotubes.

Emerging data suggest that chronic vinegar ingestion impacts fat metabolism and reduces adiposity, although no study has yet corroborated the events of vinegar supplementation metabolically through a metabolomics approach. To examine the impact of daily vinegar ingestion on glucose homeostasis, adiposity, and the metabolome, an 8-week, randomized controlled trial design was implemented utilizing two parallel treatment arms: daily red wine vinegar ingestion and a control treatment. Participants were 45 healthy adults at increased risk for metabolic complications as determined by high waist circumferences. Measurements and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. Central adiposity and visceral fat were assessed by waist circumference and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively. Plasma metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Analysis showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (p = 0.003) and insulin (p < 0.001). Insulin resistance was reduced 8.3% in the red wine vinegar group and increased 9.7% in the control group (p < 0.001). No significant between-group differences in body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, or visceral fat were observed. Significant differences were observed in amino valerate and indole-3-acetic  (p < 0.05), with high magnitudes of fold change (>2) between groups. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in tryptophan metabolism. Although daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks induced significant improvements in glucose homeostasis, our results indicate that daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks is not associated with reductions in adiposity. This is the first study to investigate the effects of daily red wine vinegar supplementation using a metabolomics approach.

Frequently associated with a number of comorbidities,  threatens and compromises individual health and quality of life. Bariatric surgery (BS) has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment to achieve not only sustained weight loss but also significant metabolic improvement that goes beyond mere weight loss. The beneficial effects of BS on metabolic traits are so widely recognized that some authors have proposed BS as metabolic surgery that could be prescribed even for moderate . However, most of the BS procedures imply malabsorption and/or gastric  reduction which lead to nutrient deficiency and, consequently, further complications could be developed in the long term. In fact, BS not only affects metabolic homeostasis but also has pronounced effects on endocrine systems other than those exclusively involved in metabolic function. The somatotropic, corticotropic, and gonadal axes as well as bone health have also been shown to be affected by the various BS procedures. Accordingly, further consequences and complications of BS in the long term in systems other than metabolic system need to be addressed in large cohorts, taking into account each bariatric procedure before making generalized recommendations for BS. In this review, current data regarding these issues are summarized, paying special attention to the somatotropic, corticotropic, gonadal axes, and bone post-operative health.Copyright © 2019 Cornejo-Pareja, Clemente-Postigo and Tinahones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592400>Drug development research for novel adiponectin receptor-targeted antidiabetic drugs contributing to healthy longevity.</a></h2><p>It is well recognized that the decrease of adiponectin associated with high-fat diet and lack of exercise accounts for the onset of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Our research efforts have led to the identification of adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, with the former shown to activate AMP kinase in the liver and the latter shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α signaling thereby increasing fatty  oxidation. Again, adiponectin upregulates mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle thereby improving glucose/lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. These findings suggested that activation of adiponectin/AdipoR signaling could represent a viable therapeutic approach to lifestyle-linked diseases associated with prevalent  thus contributing to healthy longevity in humans. Indeed, they have led to the successful discovery of AdipoRon, a small-molecule AdipoR-activating compound. Thus far, AdipoRon has been found not only to improve insulin resistance in mice but to prolong their lifespan shortened by high-fat diet. Additionally, our structure-based drug discovery research has led to AdipoR being identified as an entirely novel structure having a zinc iron bound within its seven-transmembrane domain as well as an opposite orientation to that of G protein-coupled receptors. It is expected that increasing insight into AdipoR signaling will facilitate the structure-based optimization of candidate small-molecule AdipoR-activating compounds for human use as well as the development of molecularly targeted and calorie-limiting/exercise-mimicking agents for lifestyle-linked diseases.© The Japan Diabetes Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625574>Mitochondria-targeted therapy rescues development and quality of embryos derived from oocytes matured under oxidative stress conditions: a bovine in vitro model.</a></h2><p>Can we use a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant (Mitoquinone) during in vitro embryo culture to rescue developmental competence of oocytes matured under lipotoxic conditions, exhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress?Supplementation of embryo culture media with Mitoquinone reduced oxidative stress and prevented mitochondrial uncoupling in embryos derived from metabolically compromised oocytes in vitro, leading to higher blastocyst rates and lower blastomeric apoptosis.Maternal metabolic disorders, such as  and type-II diabetes are associated with hyperlipidemia and elevated free fatty  (FFA) concentrations in the ovarian follicular fluid (FF). Oocyte maturation under these lipotoxic conditions results in increased oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced developmental competence and disappointing IVF results.A well-described bovine oocyte IVM model was used, where a pathophysiologically relevant elevated FF concentrations of palmitic  (PA; 150 μM or 300 μM) were added to induce oxidative stress. After fertilization (Day 0, D0), zygotes were in vitro cultured (IVC, from D1 to D8) in standard fatty -free media in the presence or absence of Mitoquinone or its carrier triphenyl-phosphonium.Embryo cleavage and fragmentation (D2) and blastocyst rates (D8) were recorded. Mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in cleaved embryos at D2 were determined using specific fluorogenic probes and confocal microscopy. D8 blastocysts were used to (i) examine the expression of marker genes related to mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPRmt; HSPD1 and HSPE1), mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) UPR (ATF4, ATF6 and BiP) and oxidative stress (CAT, GPX1 and SOD2) using real time RT-PCR; (ii) determine cell differentiation and apoptosis using CDX-2 and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining; and (iii) measure mtDNA copy numbers. This was tested in a series of experiments with at least three independent replicates for each, using a total of 2525 oocytes. Differences were considered significant if a P value was <0.05 after Bonferroni correction.Exposure to PA during IVM followed by culture under control conditions resulted in a significant increase in oxidative stress in embryos at D2. This was associated with a significant reduction in mitochondrial inner membrane potential (uncoupling) compared with solvent control (P < 0.05). The magnitude of these effects was PA-concentration dependent. Consequently, development to the blastocysts stage was significantly hampered. Surviving blastocysts exhibited high apoptotic cell indices and upregulated mRNA expression indicating persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial and ER UPRs. In contrast, supplementation of PA-derived zygotes with Mitoquinone during IVC (i) prevented mitochondrial uncoupling and alleviated oxidative stress at D2; and (ii) rescued blastocyst quality; normalized oxidative stress and UPR related genes and apoptotic cell indices (P > 0.01 compared with solvent control). Mitoquinone also improved blastocyst rate in PA-exposed groups, an effect that was dependent on PA concentration.N/A.This is a fundamental study performed using a bovine in vitro model using PA-induced lipotoxicity during oocyte maturation. PA is the most predominant FFA in the FF that is known to induce lipotoxicity; however, in vivo maturation in patients suffering from maternal metabolic disorders involve more factors that cannot be represented in one model. Nevertheless, focusing on the carryover oxidative stress as a known key factor affecting developmental competence, and considering the novel beneficial rescuing effects of Mitoquinone shown here, we believe this model is of high biological relevance.Human oocytes collected for IVF treatments from patients with maternal metabolic disorders are vulnerable to lipotoxicity and oxidative stress during in vivo maturation. The results shown here suggest that mitochondrial targeted therapy, such as using Mitoquinone, during IVC may rescue the developmental competence and quality of these compromised oocytes. After further clinical trials, this may be a valuable approach to increase IVF success rates for infertile patients experiencing metabolic disorders.This study was financially supported by a BOF/KP grant number 34399, from the University of Antwerp, Belgium.

Surgical solutions have become increasingly popular following technical advances leading to sustained efficacy and reduced risk. Sleeve gastrectomy accounts for almost half of all bariatric surgeries worldwide but concerns regarding its relationship with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been a topic of debate. GERD, including erosive esophagitis, is highly prevalent in the obese population. The role of pre-operative endoscopy in bariatric surgery has been controversial. Two schools of thought exist on the matter, one that believes routine upper endoscopy before bariatric surgery is not warranted in the absence of symptoms and another that believes that symptoms are poor predictors of underlying esophageal pathology. This debate is particularly important considering the evidence for the association of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) with  and/or worsening GERD compared to the less popular Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure. In this paper, we try to address 3 burning questions regarding the inter-relationship of , GERD, and LSG: (1) What is the prevalence of GERD and erosive esophagitis in obese patients considered for bariatric surgery? (2) Is it necessary to perform an upper endoscopy in obese patients considered for bariatric surgery? And (3) What are the long-term effects of sleeve gastrectomy on GERD and should LSG be done in patients with pre-existing GERD?</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549358>Potential of Cannabinoid Receptor Ligands as Treatment for Substance Use Disorders.</a></h2><p>Substance use disorder (SUD) is a major public health crisis worldwide, and effective treatment options are limited. During the past 2 decades, researchers have investigated the impact of a variety of pharmacological approaches to treat SUD, one of which is the use of medical cannabis or cannabinoids. Significant progress was made with the discovery of rimonabant, a selective CB1 receptor (CB1R) antagonist (also an inverse agonist), as a promising therapeutic for SUDs and . However, serious adverse effects such as depression and suicidality led to the withdrawal of rimonabant (and almost all other CB1R antagonists/inverse agonists) from clinical trials worldwide in 2008. Since then, much research interest has shifted to other cannabinoid-based strategies, such as peripheral CB1R antagonists/inverse agonists, neutral CB1R antagonists, allosteric CB1R modulators, CB2R agonists, fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitors, fatty  binding protein (FABP) inhibitors, or nonaddictive phytocannabinoids with CB1R or CB2R-binding profiles, as new therapeutics for SUDs. In this article, we first review recent progress in research regarding the endocannabinoid systems, cannabis reward versus aversion, and the underlying receptor mechanisms. We then review recent progress in cannabinoid-based medication development for the treatment of SUDs. As evidence continues to accumulate, neutral CB1R antagonists (such as AM4113), CB2R agonists (JWH133, Xie2-64), and nonselective phytocannabinoids (cannabidiol, β-caryophyllene, ∆-tetrahydrocannabivarin) have shown great therapeutic potential for SUDs, as shown in experimental animals.

Dysregulated metabolism leads to many life-threatening diseases including , diabetes, and cancer. Mitochondria, subcellular organelles, contain the central energy-producing metabolic pathway, the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle. Also, mitochondria exist in a dynamic network orchestrated by extracellular nutrient levels and intracellular energy needs. Upon stimulation, mitochondria undergo consistent interchange through fusion (small to big) and fission (big to small) processes. Mitochondrial fusion is primarily controlled by three GTPases, mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), Mfn2, and optic atrophy 1 (Opa1), while mitochondrial fission is primarily regulated by GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Dysregulated activity of these GTPases results in disrupted mitochondrial dynamics and cellular metabolism.

It was hypothesized that lowering FFA with acipimox, a nicotinic  derivative that impairs FFA efflux, would improve endothelial function, measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD), in individuals with metabolic syndrome.A total of 18 participants with metabolic syndrome and 17 healthy controls were enrolled and treated with acipimox 250 mg orally every 6 hours or placebo for 7 days in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial.Acipimox reduced FFA concentrations among individuals with metabolic syndrome to near normal levels (P = 0.01), but there was no change among healthy controls (P = 0.17). Acipimox did not improve endothelial-dependent FMD in either group (metabolic syndrome: P = 0.42; healthy controls: P = 0.16), although endothelial-independent nitroglycerin-mediated dilation among those with metabolic syndrome tended to increase (20.3%, P = 0.06). There were no changes in blood lipids or markers of inflammation following therapy.

Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and adjustable gastric banding (AGB) have gained popularity since the beginning of this century because of their efficacy, safety, and simplicity. SG, in particular, has emerged as the most popular bariatric procedure because of its simpler concept and shorter operative time compared with gastric bypass. Caloric restriction, however, cannot account for the sustained weight loss and improved glucose metabolism seen following SG and AGB. Other mechanisms, including changes in gastrointestinal hormone secretion, rearrangement of hypothalamic and vagal control, alteration in energy expenditure, and re-regulation of bile  metabolism and the intestinal flora environment, are thought to contribute to the postoperative benefits. This review focuses on clinical and experimental literature addressing the potential mechanisms for SG and AGB procedures in human and animal models. Understanding such mechanisms can provide important insight into how current gastric restrictive procedures work and how future treatments of , both surgical and nonsurgical, can be developed.© 2019 The  Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656969> and tooth wear among American adults: the role of sugar-sweetened acidic drinks.</a></h2><p>To explore the association between  and tooth wear among American adults and the role of sugar-sweetened acidic drinks consumption in explaining that association.We analyzed data from 3541 adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.  was determined using the body mass index and tooth wear was assessed using the modified tooth wear index.

Apolipoprotein A5 (ApoA5) has been shown to influence the prevalence and pathology of . However, the underlying mechanisms remains to be unclarified.Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) were treated with 600 ng/ml ApoA5. The effect of ApoA5 on affecting intracellular TG content and adipogenic related factors expression were determined. Furthermore, the effect of ApoA5 on CIDE-C expression was also determined.During the AMSCs adipogenesis, ApoA5 could reduce the intracellular lipid droplets accumulation and the TG level; meanwhile, ApoA5 down-regulated the expression level of adipogenic related factors, including CCAAT enhancer binding proteins α/β (C/EBPα/β), fatty  synthetase (FAS) and fatty -binding protein 4 (FABP4). Furthermore, the suppression of adipogenesis by ApoA5 was mediated through the inhibition of CIDE-C expression, an important factor which could promote the process of human AMSCs adipogenesis. However, over-expressing intracellular expression of CIDE-C could lead to the loss-of-function of ApoA5 in inhibiting AMSCs adipogenesis.In conclusion, ApoA5 could inhibit human AMSCs adipogenesis through, at least partly, down-regulating CIDE-C expression. The present study provides insight into the mechanisms underlying the anti- effect of ApoA5 and suggests that ApoA5 has the potential to prevent  by acting on AMSCs.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600939>Phlorotannins from  Attenuates Palmitate-Induced Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Leptin Resistance in Hypothalamic Neurons.</a></h2><p>Leptin resistance in the hypothalamus has an essential role in . Saturated fatty  such as palmitate bind to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and leptin resistance. In this study, we evaluated whether extracts of  would attenuate the ER stress induced by palmitate and reduce leptin resistance in hypothalamic neurons and microglia. We added palmitate to these cells to mimic the environment induced by high-fat diet in the hypothalamus and evaluated which of the  phlorotannins-dieckol (DK), 2,7-phloroglucinol-6,6-bieckol (PHB), pyrogallol-phloroglucinol-6,6-bieckol (PPB), or phlorofucofuroeckol-A (PFFA)-had the most potent effect on attenuating leptin resistance. TLR4 and NF-κB expression induced by palmitate was attenuated most effectively by PPB in both hypothalamic neurons and microglia. ER stress markers were increased by palmitate and were attenuated by PPB in both hypothalamic neurons and microglia. Leptin resistance, which was evaluated as an increase in SOCS3 and a decrease in STAT3 with leptin receptor expression, was increased by palmitate and was decreased by PPB in hypothalamic neurons. The culture medium from palmitate-treated microglia increased leptin resistance in hypothalamic neurons and this resistance was attenuated by PPB. In conclusion, PPB attenuated leptin resistance by decreasing ER stress in both hypothalamic neurons and microglia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630795>Von Willebrand factor A domain-containing protein 8 (VWA8) localizes to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane.</a></h2><p>VWA8 is a poorly characterized mitochondrial AAA + ATPase protein. The specific submitochondrial localization of VWA8 remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the specific submitochondrial compartment within which VWA8 resides in order to provide more insight into the function of this protein. Bioinformatics analysis showed that VWA8 has a 34 amino  N-terminal Matrix-Targeting Signal (MTS) that is similar to those in proteins known to localize to the mitochondrial matrix. Experiments in C2C12 mouse myoblasts using confocal microscopy showed that deletion of the VWA8 MTS (vMTS) resulted in cytosolic, rather than mitochondrial, localization of VWA8. Biochemical analysis using differential sub-fractionation of mitochondria isolated from rat liver showed that VWA8 localizes to the matrix side of inner mitochondrial membrane, similar to the inner mitochondrial membrane protein Electron Transfer Flavoprotein-ubiquinone Oxidoreductase (ETFDH). The results of these experiments show that the vMTS is essential for localization to the mitochondrial matrix and that once there, VWA8 localizes to the matrix side of inner mitochondrial membrane.Copyright © 2019.

A retrospective observational cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>The Japanese government has developed and promoted a national nutrient-based dietary guideline for preventing lifestyle-related chronic disease. However, its impact in a real-life setting has never been evaluated. We performed a critical appraisal of the guideline by examining the association between adherence to the guideline and lifestyle-related outcome indicators.This is a retrospective observational cross-sectional study using nationally representative data on health and nutrition characteristics from the 2016 National Health and Nutrition Survey of Japan. We considered 3,861 participants aged ≥20 years, with evidence of low health risks of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and . Five health outcome indicators (hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and body mass index), were employed. A summary score was developed to reflect adherence to the recommended intake of seven nutrients defined by the guideline, including proteins, fat, saturated fatty , carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sodium, and potassium. Multivariate quartile regression approaches were employed to examine the association between the adherence score and the health outcome indicators, adjusting for the covariates.Overall, the proportion of those who adhered to the guideline (adherence rate) for all seven nutrients was only 0.3%. There was considerable variation in the adherence rate between the different nutrients, from 24.2% to 61.8%. After adjustment for covariates, in most health outcome indicators, regardless of age category and quartile, there was no clear association between the guideline adherence score and indicators.There is plenty of scope for improving the guideline. Nutrient impact on health may not necessarily depend on the amount of each nutrient in the diet. The significance and contribution of synergies between nutrients and complex interactions within foods to health outcomes need to be explored in future guideline updates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546888>Dietary  Load: A Novel Nutritional Target in Overweight/Obese Children with Asthma?</a></h2><p> has been repeatedly linked to asthma, and several potential mechanisms have been proposed in the etiologies of the obese-asthma phenotype. Considering that lungs play an important role in systemic pH and -base regulation, are a key organ in asthma development, and that nutritional inadequacy of several nutrients and high dietary  load can affect airway inflammation and reactivity, we aimed to test the hypothesis that dietary  load may be associated with asthma in children. Data on 699 children (52% females), aged 7-12 years, were analyzed. Anthropometric measurements were performed to assess body mass index. Dietary  load was calculated using potential renal  load (PRAL) equations from a 24 h dietary recall administrated to children. Adjusted PRAL for total energy intake was applied with the use of the residual method. Lung function and airway reversibility were assessed with spirometry. Asthma was defined by a positive bronchodilation or self-reported medical diagnosis with reported symptoms (wheezing, dyspnea, or dry cough) in the past 12 months. After adjustment for energy intake, sex, age, parent's education level, and physical activity, positive and significant associations were found between asthma and PRAL [odds ratio (OR) = 1.953, 95% CI = 1.024, 3.730) in overweight/obese children.

SQA at 10 µM reduced lipid accumulation by approximately 23%. SQA at 2.5 - 10 µM induced the differentiation of white adipocytes to beige adipocytes partially by increasing the mitochondrial density and the expression of beige/brown adipocyte markers. In addition, SQA activated lipid catabolic pathways, evidenced by the increased expression levels of perilipin, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1.

The Mediterranean diet (MD) is an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern, which is rich in complex carbohydrates and fiber, and high in monounsaturated fat. There is a close association among , low-grade chronic inflammation, IR, and hormonal derangements in PCOS. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the adherence to MD, the dietary intake, and the body composition and their association with PCOS clinical severity in a cohort of treatment-naïve women with PCOS when compared with a control group of healthy women matched for age and body mass index (BMI). In this case-controlled, cross-sectional study, we enrolled 112 patients with PCOS and 112 controls. PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) and seven-day food records were used to evaluate the degree of adherence to the MD and dietary pattern, respectively. Body composition was evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) phase-sensitive system. Testosterone levels and Ferriman-Gallwey score assessed the clinical severity of PCOS. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined with a nephelometric assay with CardioPhase high sensitivity. PCOS women showed higher testosterone levels, Ferriman-Gallwey score, fasting insulin and glucose levels, and Homeostatic Model Assessment (HoMA)-IR when compared with the control group ( < 0.001). In addition, we found that the PCOS women consumed less extra-virgin olive oil, legumes, fish/seafood, and nuts compared with control group. Despite no differences in energy intake between the two groups, the PCOS women consumed a lower quantity of complex carbohydrate, fiber, monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA), and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), and higher quantity of simple carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fatty  (SFA), PUFA and n-6 PUFA than the control group. The PCOS women have an adverse body composition when compared with controls, with the lowest values of phase angle (PhA) and fat-free mass ( < 0.001). Additionally, after adjusting for BMI and total energy intake, testosterone levels showed significant negative correlations with PREDIMED score ( < 0.001) and consumption of protein ( = 0.005), complex carbohydrate ( < 0.001), fiber ( < 0.001), MUFA ( < 0.001), n-3 PUFA ( = 0.001), and positive associations with CRP levels, simple carbohydrate, SFA, n-6 PUFA ( < 0.001, respectively), and PUFA ( = 0.002). The cut-off for PREDIMED score ≤ 6 ( < 0.001, area under the curve (AUC) 0.848, standard error 0.036, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.768 to 0.909) could serve as a threshold for significantly increased risk of high value of testosterone levels. In conclusion, a novel direct association between the adherence to MD and the clinical severity of the disease was reported in women with PCOS. This association could support a therapeutic role of foods and nutrients of the Mediterranean dietary pattern in the PCOS pathogenesis likely involving their inflammatory status, IR, and hyperandrogenemia. In addition, we reported a different body composition that is characterized by lower PhA and fat-free mass than controls. These data suggested a role of PhA as a useful marker of the clinical severity of this syndrome and provided strong evidence regarding the strategic relevance of the nutritional assessment in the management of women with PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548686>Gut bacteria responding to dietary change encode sialidases that exhibit preference for red meat-associated carbohydrates.</a></h2><p>Dietary habits have been associated with alterations of the human gut resident microorganisms contributing to , diabetes and cancer. In Western diets, red meat is a frequently eaten food, but long-term consumption has been associated with increased risk of disease. Red meat is enriched in N-glycolylneuraminic  (Neu5Gc) that cannot be synthesized by humans. However, consumption can cause Neu5Gc incorporation into cell surface glycans, especially in carcinomas. As a consequence, an inflammatory response is triggered when Neu5Gc-containing glycans encounter circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. Although bacteria can use free sialic  as a nutrient source, it is currently unknown if gut microorganisms contribute to releasing Neu5Gc from food. We found that a Neu5Gc-rich diet induces changes in the gut microbiota, with Bacteroidales and Clostridiales responding the most. Genome assembling of mouse and human shotgun metagenomic sequencing identified bacterial sialidases with previously unobserved substrate preference for Neu5Gc-containing glycans. X-ray crystallography revealed key amino  potentially contributing to substrate preference. Additionally, we verified that mouse and human sialidases were able to release Neu5Gc from red meat. The release of Neu5Gc from red meat using bacterial sialidases could reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases associated with red meat consumption, including colorectal cancer and atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620596>The effect of thalidomide on visceral fat pad mass and triglyceride concentration of the skeletal muscles in rats.</a></h2><p>Body fats, especially both of abdominal fat pad mass and skeletal muscle fat content, are inversely related to insulin action. Therefore, methods for decreasing visceral fat mass and muscle triglyceride content may be helpful for the prevention of insulin resistance.Thalidomide, used for its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties, was administered to rats for 4 weeks. A 10% solution of thalidomide in dimethyl sulfoxide was injected daily into the peritoneal cavity as much as 100 mg/kg of body weight.The total visceral fat pad mass in the thalidomide-treated group was 11% lower than in the control group. The size of adipocytes of the epididymal fat pad mass in the thalidomide-treated group was smaller than in the control group. The intraperitoneal thalidomide treatment increased triglyceride concentrations by 16% in the red muscle, but not in the white muscle.The results suggested that intraperitoneal thalidomide treatment inhibited abdominal fat accumulation, and that the free fatty  in the blood were preferentially accumulated in the red muscle rather than in the white muscle.Copyright © 2018 Yeungnam University College of Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673045>Hepatic Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 deficiency-mediated activation of mTORC1- PGC-1α axis regulates ER stress during high-carbohydrate feeding.</a></h2><p>Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a key enzyme in lipogenesis as it catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty  (MUFAs), mainly oleate (18:1n9) and palmitoleate (16:1n7) from saturated fatty  (SFA), stearate (18:0) and palmitate (16:0), respectively. Studies on SCD1 deficiency in mouse models demonstrated beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance. Even though, SCD1 represents a potential target to resolve  related metabolic diseases; SCD1 deficiency causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates unfolded protein response (UPR). The induction of ER stress in response to SCD1 deficiency is governed by the cofactor, PGC-1α. However, the mechanism by which SCD1 deficiency increases PGC-1α and subsequently induces ER stress still remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that despite reduced lipogenesis, liver specific SCD1 deficiency activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) along with induction of PGC-1α and ER stress. Further, mTORC1 inhibition attenuates SCD1 deficiency-mediated induction of both PGC-1α and ER stress. Similar observations were seen by restoring endogenously synthesized oleate, but not palmitoleate, suggesting a clear mTORC1-mediated regulation of ER stress during SCD1 deficiency. Overall, our results suggest a model whereby maintaining adequate levels of hepatic oleate is required to suppress mTORC1-mediated ER stress. In addition, the activation of mTORC1 by SCD1 deficiency reveals an important function of fatty  in regulating different cellular processes through mTORC1 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581733>Specific Wheat Fractions Influence Hepatic Fat Metabolism in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Low whole grain consumption is a risk factor for the development of non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Dietary fiber and phytochemicals are bioactive grain compounds, which could be involved in mediating these beneficial effects. These compounds are not equally distributed in the wheat grain, but are enriched in the bran and aleurone fractions. As little is known on physiological effects of different wheat fractions, the aim of this study was to investigate this aspect in an  model. For twelve weeks, C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat diets (HFD), supplemented with one of four wheat fractions: whole grain flour, refined white flour, bran, or aleurone. The different diets did not affect body weight, however bran and aleurone decreased liver triglyceride content, and increased hepatic n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) concentrations. Furthermore, lipidomics analysis revealed increased PUFA concentration in the lipid classes of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC-ether, and phosphatidylinositol in the plasma of mice fed whole grain, bran, and aleurone supplemented diets, compared to refined white flour. Furthermore, bran, aleurone, and whole grain supplemented diets increased microbial α-diversity, but only bran and aleurone increased the cecal concentrations of short-chain fatty .

For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti- effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against  and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669578>Chronic exposure to liquid sucrose and dry sucrose diet have differential effects on peripheral taste responses in female rats.</a></h2><p>Sugar-sweetened beverages are the major source of added calories in the Western diet and their prevalence is associated with  and metabolic disruption. Despite the critical role of the taste system in determining food selection and consumption, the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the peripheral taste system in mammals have received limited attention. We offered female Sprague Dawley rats free access to water and one of three diets for up to 40 days: (1) sucrose-free chow or "NS" diet; (2) a high-sucrose dry diet or "HS"; or (3) 30% sucrose solution and the NS diet, designated "LiqS" diet. Sucrose consumption by LiqS rats gradually increased and by day 14 was equal to that of HS rats. Food intake decreased in LiqS rats, but their energy intake remained higher than for NS or HS rats. There was no significant difference in weight gain of the groups during the study. Recordings from the chorda tympani nerve (CT), which innervates taste buds on the anterior tongue, revealed decreased responses to 1 M sucrose in both LiqS and HS rats and to acesulfame K and salt tastants in LiqS rats after 40 days on diet. Umami, bitter, and  response magnitudes were unchanged in both groups. These results demonstrate that chronic sucrose exposure inhibits taste responses to higher concentrations of sweet stimuli. More surprisingly, CT responses to NaCl and 0.5M NaAc were significantly reduced in rats on the LiqS diet. Thus, the physical form of the diet influences taste responsiveness to salt and sweet taste function. These data suggest that taste buds are previously unappreciated targets of chronic sucrose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

BAT has been previously assumed to contain a homogeneous population of brown adipocytes. Utilizing multiple mouse models capable of genetically labeling different cellular populations, as well as single-cell RNA sequencing, and 3D tissue profiling, we discovered a new brown adipocyte subpopulation with low thermogenic activity co-existing with the classical high thermogenic brown adipocytes within the BAT. These low thermogenic brown adipocytes had significantly lower Ucp1 and Adipoq expression, larger lipid droplets, and lower mitochondrial content. Functional analyses showed that the low thermogenic brown adipocytes have significant lower basal mitochondrial respiration, and they are specialized in fatty  uptake. Upon changes in environmental temperature, the two brown adipocyte subpopulations underwent dynamic inter-conversions. Cold exposure converted low thermogenic brown adipocytes into high thermogenic cells, and a thermoneutral environment had the opposite effect. This recruitment of high thermogenic brown adipocytes by cold stimulation is not affected by high fat diet feeding, but significantly declined with age.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the overall diet composition of the population through non-invasive and independent indexes or scores as diet quality indexes (DQIs). The primary aim of the present work was to estimate the adequacy of the intake of critical nutrients in the Spanish "Anthropometry, Intake, and Energy Balance Study" (ANIBES) ( = 2285; 9-75 years), considering, as a reference, the European Food Scientific Authority (EFSA) values for nutrients for the European Union. We also assessed the quality of the diet for adults and older adults using four internationally accepted DQIs, namely the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI), the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), the Mediterranean Diet Score-modified (MDS-mod), and the Mediterranean-Diet Quality Index (MED-DQI), as well as the ANIBES-DQI, stratified by education and income. The ANIBES-DQI was based on compliance with EFSA and Food and Agriculture Organization recommendations for a selected group of nutrients (i.e., total fat, saturated fatty  (SFAs), simple sugars, fiber, calcium, vitamin C, and vitamin A), with a total range of 0-7. Misreporting was assessed according to the EFSA protocol, which allowed us to assess the DQIs for both the general population and plausible reporters. The majority of the Spanish population had high intakes of SFAs and sugars and low intakes of fiber, folate, and vitamins A and C. In addition, about half of the population had low DQI scores and exhibited low adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern. Overall, older adults (>65-75 years) showed better DQIs than adults (18-64 years), without major differences between men and women. Moreover, primary education and low income were associated with low MDS and ANIBES-DQI scores. For the ANIBES-DQI, the percentage of the population with low scores was higher in the whole population (69.5%) compared with the plausible energy reporters (49.0%), whereas for medium and high scores the percentages were higher in plausible reporters (41.2% vs. 26.2% and 9.8% vs. 4.3%, respectively). In conclusion, the present study adds support to marked changes in the Mediterranean pattern in Spain, and low education and income levels seem to be associated with a low-quality diet.

Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic  (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty  (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

FXR plays critical roles in other lipid metabolic pathways, including fat oxidation; however, little is known about cafestol's effects on fatty  metabolism. Thus, the goal was to investigate cafestol's effects on fatty  metabolism using Caenorhabditis elegans. Cafestol at 60 µM reduced fat accumulation and increased locomotor activity (an indicator of energy expenditure) by 20% and 38%, respectively, compared to the control. Cafestol's effects were dependent on daf-12 (a functional homolog of the human FXR) with upregulation of ech-1.1 (a homolog of enoyl-CoA hydratase involved in fatty  β-oxidation) and tub-1 (an ortholog of the human TUBBY involved in the neurological regulation of energy expenditure) without any effects on lipogenesis, lipolysis or lipid uptake and transport. Therefore, cafestol increased fat oxidation and energy expenditure via DAF-12-dependent pathway in C. elegans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is heterogeneous; arising from five circulating glycoproteins with dynamic concentrations: alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), alpha-1- glycoprotein (AGP), haptoglobin (HP), transferrin (TF), and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (AACT). The contributions of each glycoprotein to the disease and mortality risks predicted by GlycA remain unknown.We trained imputation models for AAT, AGP, HP, and TF from NMR metabolite measurements in 626 adults from a population cohort with matched NMR and immunoassay data. Levels of AAT, AGP, and HP were estimated in 11,861 adults from two population cohorts with eight years of follow-up, then each biomarker was tested for association with all common endpoints. Whole blood gene expression data was used to identify cellular processes associated with elevated AAT.Accurate imputation models were obtained for AAT, AGP, and HP but not for TF. While AGP had the strongest correlation with GlycA, our analysis revealed variation in imputed AAT levels was the most predictive of morbidity and mortality for the widest range of diseases over the eight year follow-up period, including heart failure (meta-analysis hazard ratio = 1.60 per standard deviation increase of AAT, P-value = 1×10-10), influenza and pneumonia (HR = 1.37, P = 6×10-10), and liver diseases (HR = 1.81, P = 1×10-6). Transcriptional analyses revealed association of elevated AAT with diverse inflammatory immune pathways.This study clarifies the molecular underpinnings of the GlycA biomarker's associated disease risk, and indicates a previously unrecognised association between elevated AAT and severe disease onset and mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661720>Changes of gut microbiota during silybin mediated treatment of high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver diseasein mouse.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota involved in pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

We aimed to examine the effect of Sil on intestinal flora dysbiosis induced by high-fat diet (HFD).After 10 weeks of feeding normal chow diet (NCD) or HFD, mice were given daily by gavage for 8 weeks. Cecal contents were harvested for study of short chain fatty  (SCFAs), bile  and gut microbiota alteration.Sil showed protective effects against dietary-induced  and liver steatosis, accordingly gut microbiota composition changed. At phylum level, compared with HFD group, mice in the Sil-treated group had significant lower level of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (P<0.05). At genus level, Sil-treated group have significant lower level of Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 and Mollicutes_RF9, which were reported to be potentially related to diet-induced , and increased levels of Blautia (P<0.05), Akkermansia (P<0.05), Bacteroides(P<0.05) which were known to have beneficial effect on improving NAFLD. Sil also showed inhibitory effect on well-known beneficial bacteria, such as Alloprevotella, Lactobacillus. Moreover, production of acetate, propionate and butyrate increased, while generation of formate and conversion of cytotoxic secondary metabolites (LCA, DCA) decreased in mice treated with Sil.Sil might have beneficial effects on ameliorating NAFLD and mediate HFD-induced change of gut microbiota composition, followed with major changes in secondary metabolites, such as SCFAs and BAs.This article is protected by copyright.

In obese non-diabetic adolescents, we investigated if the OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak also reflects incretin and free fatty  (FFA) responses besides insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, measured by the clamp.Obese adolescents (n=278) were categorized according to their OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak by Early-peak (at 30 min) vs. Late-peak (>30 min) groups. Body composition, visceral adipose tissue, oral disposition index (oDI) and OGTT-area under the curve (AUC) were examined. A subset of 102 participants had both hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps to measure in vivo insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity.Compared with the Early-peak group, the Late-peak group had impaired β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, lower glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)-AUC, and higher FFA-AUC despite higher insulin and C-peptide-AUC. They also had lower hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity despite similar percent body fat and visceral adipose tissue, and had higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (all P<0.05).In obese non-diabetic youth, those with a Late-peak vs. an Early-peak glucose during an OGTT showed diminished β-cell function, blunted incretin secretion, and lower insulin sensitivity of glucose and FFA metabolism.

We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the -associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic , cholic , 1H-indole-3-acetic , 3-indole acrylic  and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic , l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on.

How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA diets leads to hyperphagia,  and reduced lifespan. These effects are not due to elevated BCAA  or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet.

Routine hematologic, anthropometric and metabolic parameters as well as TSH, ghrelin and Met-enkephalins values were measured in all patients.There were statistically significant differences between two groups before the surgery in terms of TSH, both forms of Met-enkephalin, triglycerides concentrations, activity of ALT, GGTP and CRP. After 72 h, the serum levels of cryptic Met-enkephalin, CRP and activity of enzymes varied between the two groups of patients. Thirty days after the surgery, some metabolic and immune parameters were still different in both female groups in favour of patients with lover BMI.

The safety of its oral consumption in humans is also determined.Mice are given high-fat diets (HFD) for 8 weeks. Thereafter, AvoB or vehicle is administered orally twice weekly for 5 weeks. AvoB inhibits FAO which led to improved glucose tolerance, glucose utilization, and insulin sensitivity. AvoB's effects on metabolism under lipotoxic conditions are evaluated in vitro in pancreatic β-islet cells and C2C12 myotubes. AvoB inhibits FAO and increases glucose oxidation, resulting in lowering of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species that improves insulin responsiveness in C2C12 myotubes and insulin secretion in INS-1 (832/13) cells, respectively. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in healthy human participants is conducted to assess the safety of AvoB consumption (50 mg or 200 mg per day for 60 days). AvoB is well-tolerated and not associated with any dose-limiting toxicity.Therapeutic agents that are safe and effectively inhibit FAO and improve DIO-associated pathologies are currently not available.

The variables (biomarkers) are concentrations of fasting plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, glucagon, non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) and very low density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDLTG), as well as muscle lipids, hepatic lipids, pancreatic lipids, fat mass and mass of β-cells. The model predicts isocaloric high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF) diet and low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) diet trajectories to health which vary in fat mass by at most a few kilograms at steady state. The LCHF trajectories to health are faster than isocaloric HCLF trajectories with respect to fat mass loss, although these trajectories may be slower initially if parameters are adjusting from HCLF values. On LC diets, leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance are thought to increase. Increasing leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance is predicted to lower lipids including fat mass and VLDLTG. The model predicts that changes in VLDLTG due to a change in diet happen rapidly, approaching steady state values after a few weeks, reflecting leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance which are much harder to measure. The model predicts that if only insulin sensitivity increases on a LC diet, steady state fat mass would increase slightly. If leptin and insulin sensitivities increase concurrently, the combined effect could be a decrease in fat mass, consistent with the fact that increasing insulin sensitivity is often associated with fat mass loss in trials. The model predicts trajectories to fat type II diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia due to high carbohydrate moderate fat diets, on which insulin rises before falling, as ectopic fat deposits increase; made fatter and more diabetic by higher lipid consumption. It predicts trajectories to non-diabetic states with raised fat mass, VLDLTG and muscle, hepatic and pancreatic lipids due to moderate carbohydrate high fat diets. The model predicts paths to lean type II diabetes, on a diet of moderate energy but low β-cell replication rate or high death rate.Copyright © 2019.

We hypothesized that DHA supplementation after HFD exposure reverses HFD-induced ovarian defects. We conducted a dietary intervention with reversal to chow, DHA-supplemented chow, or DHA-supplemented HFD after HFD consumption. After 10 weeks, HFD-fed mice had impaired estrous cyclicity, decreased primordial follicles, and altered ovarian expression of 24 genes compared to chow controls. Diet reversal to either chow or chow + DHA restored estrous cyclicity, however only chow + DHA appeared to mitigated the impact of HFD on ovarian reserve. All dietary interventions restored HFD-dysregulated gene expression to chow levels. We found no association between follicular fluid DHA levels and ovarian reserve.

It is unclear whether improvements to perinatal diet quality could alter the infant gut microbiota.The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a perinatal educational dietary intervention in influencing gut microbiota in mothers and infants 4 weeks after birth.The Healthy Parents, Healthy Kids randomized controlled trial aimed to recruit 90 pregnant women from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. At week 26 of gestation, women were randomized to receive dietary advice from their doctor (n=45), or additionally receive a dietary intervention (n=45). The intervention included an educational workshop and 2 support calls aiming to align participants' diets with the Australian Dietary Guidelines and increase intakes of prebiotic and probiotic foods. The educational design focused on active learning and self-assessment. Behavior change techniques were used to support dietary adherence, and the target behavior was eating for the gut microbiota. Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years, diagnosed mental illnesses, , diabetes mellitus, diagnosed bowel conditions, exclusion diets, illicit drug use, antibiotic use, prebiotic or probiotic supplementation, and those lacking dietary autonomy. The primary outcome measure is a between-group difference in alpha diversity in infant stool collected 4 weeks after birth. Secondary outcomes include evaluating the efficacy of the intervention in influencing infant and maternal stool microbial composition and short chain fatty  concentrations, epigenetic profile, and markers of inflammation and stress, as well as changes in maternal dietary intake and well-being.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino  availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino  supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to investigate the role of microRNA-320 (miR-320) in the development of ERs and the inflammatory response in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.The adipose tissue expression levels of miR-320 and ERs markers (GRP78, GRP94, Derlin-1 and CHOP) and the serum concentration of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, NF-κB and IL-6) in obese patients were evaluated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The correlation of miR-320 with genes involved in ERs and inflammation was analyzed. The effects of miR-320 on ERs and inflammation were explored using mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which were pretreated with palmitic  (PA).ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines were all upregulated in obese patients. Adipose tissue miR-320 expression was also increased in obese patients, and had positive correlations with the levels of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines. After PA treatment, the levels of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines were elevated significantly in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, miR-320 expression was increased in the cells under ERs status. The upregulation of miR-320 could enhance the expression of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines, but the downregulation of miR-320 resulted in the opposite results.The data of this study indicate that miR-320 expression is upregulated in ERs status, and the downregulation of miR-320 ameliorates ERs and the inflammatory response in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We consider that the approaches to decrease miR-320 expression may be novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of  and -related diseases.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654701>Adipokines underlie the early origins of  and associated metabolic comorbidities in the offspring of women with pregestational .</a></h2><p>Maternal pregestational  is a well-known risk factor for offspring , metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms by which maternal  can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal metabolism are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational . The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational  and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal weight and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal . High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal  lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational  enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino  transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational , focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.Copyright © 2019.

High UA was defined as ≥ 75th percentile by sex in children and adolescents.The population was stratified in four categories: (1) normal eGFR and absence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD) (n = 1,236); (2) ReGFR and absence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD (n = 155); (3) normal eGFR and presence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD (n = 1019); (4) presence of both conditions (ReGFR/NAFLD) (n = 155). Proportions of youth with high UA across the four categories were 17%, 30%, 33% and 46%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Young people with high levels of UA had odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.11 (1.43-3.11) for ReGFR; 2.82 (2.26-3.45) for NAFLD; and 5.04 (3.45-7.39) for both conditions (P < 0.0001 for all), independently of major confounders.High levels of UA were independently associated with ReGFR, NAFLD and the combination of both conditions in young people with OW/OB.

In particular, protein malnutrition is one of the determinants of frailty and sarcopenia in elderly people.To investigate the role of amino  supplementation in senior patients we performed an open-label randomized trial and administered a particular branched-chain amino  enriched mixture (BCAAem) or provided diet advice in 155 elderly malnourished patients. They were followed for 2 months, assessing cognitive performance by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), muscle mass measured by anthropometry, strength measure by hand grip and performance measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the 30 s Chair Sit to Stand (30-s CST) test and the 4 m gait speed test. Moreover we measured oxidative stress in plasma and mitochondrial production of ATP and electron flux in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Both groups improved in nutritional status, general health and muscle mass, strength and performance; treatment with BCAAem supplementation was more effective than simple diet advice in increasing MMSE (1.2 increase versus 0.2, p = 0.0171), ATP production (0.43 increase versus -0.1, p = 0.0001), electron flux (0.50 increase versus 0.01, p < 0.0001) and in maintaining low oxidative stress. The amelioration of clinical parameters as MMSE, balance, four meter walking test were associated to increased mitochondrial function.Overall, our findings show that sustaining nutritional support might be clinically relevant in increasing physical performance in elderly malnourished patients and that the use of specific BCAAem might ameliorate also cognitive performance thanks to an amelioration of mitochondria bioenergetics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The relative sialylation of the Fc glycan on mouse IgG, which influences IgG activation of Fc receptors, was evaluated by SNAlectin blotting. Effects of IgG on endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) were assessed in human aortic endothelial cells. IgG Fc glycan sialylation was interrogated in 3442 human subjects by mass spectrometry, and the relationship between sialylation and BP was evaluated. Effects of normalizing IgG sialylation were determined in HFD-fed mice administered the sialic  precursor N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc).  Mice deficient in B cells were protected from -induced hypertension. Compared to IgG from control chow-fed mice, IgG from HFD-fed mice was hyposialylated, and it raised BP when transferred to recipients lacking IgG; the hypertensive response was absent if recipients were FcγRIIB-deficient. Neuraminidase (NA)-treated IgG lacking the Fc glycan terminal sialic  also raised BP.

Although LPZ target tissues remain poorly understood, possible sites of action include adipose tissue. In this study, we assessed effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation and function by using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and HFD-induced  mice as an in vitro and in vivo model, respectively.Oil red O staining and intracellular triacylglycerol content were used to determine lipid accumulation. Glucose uptake was performed to measure mature adipocyte function. Expression of adipocyte genes was determined by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting.LPZ has dual effects on differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. At low concentrations, LPZ enhanced adipocyte differentiation via induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα, two master adipogenic transcription factors, as well as lipogenic proteins, ACC1 and FASN. Increasing of adipocyte number subsequently increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and expression of Glut4 mRNA. Conversely, high concentrations of LPZ strongly inhibited differentiation and expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, and maintained expression of preadipocytes markers, β-catenin and Pref-1. Inhibition of adipogenesis by LPZ reduced mature adipocyte number, Glut4 mRNA expression and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, treatment with LPZ at 200 mg/kg significantly reduced body weight gain and total fat mass in HFD-induced obese mice.These results indicate that effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation are dependent on concentration and are correlated with PPARγ and C/EBPα.Copyright © 2019.

However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of  and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause  and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions.

Plasma levels of Ad are reduced in , which contributes to type 2 diabetes. Therefore, agents that activate the Ad signaling pathway could ameliorate metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Here, we report the identification of a high-affinitive agonist antibody against Ad receptors. The antibody was selected by using phage display of human combinatorial antibody libraries. The selected antibody induced phosphorylation of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and AMPK in skeletal muscle cells and stimulated glucose uptake and fatty- oxidation (FAO) in myotubes. In addition, the antibody significantly lowered blood glucose levels during a glucose challenge in normal mice as well as basal blood glucose levels in a type 2 diabetic mouse model.

To test this hypothesis, mice were randomly fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD supplemented with myricitrin for 16 weeks. Myricitrin significantly reduced white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, adipocyte size, and plasma leptin levels, and also attenuated dyslipidemia. These changes appeared to result from increased energy expenditure and activation of the carnitine acyltransferase (CPT) and -oxidation in WAT. Expressions of the proinflammatory genes , , , and  were also lower in the WAT of myricitrin-supplemented mice. Moreover, myricitrin markedly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation and plasma aspartate transaminase levels by increasing CPT activity and reducing fatty  synthase activity in the liver.

Fourteen articles were finally included.Exercise-induced free radical and inflammatory marker blood levels, but not changed the plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC), after administration of antioxidant supplement. The oral administration of antioxidants produced null or negative effect on endothelial function, but the infusion into the brachial artery during rhythmic handgrip exercise produced a significant improvement in muscle blood flow, due to an on increase in the availability of nitric  derived from the nitric oxide synthase. Aerobic exercise and antioxidant supplementation improved submaximal and maximal aerobic parameters, as well as mitochondrial density and mitochondria-regulated apoptotic signaling. Antioxidant supplementation, but not omega-3 PUFA, decreased pro-inflammatory marker levels and fat oxidation induced by exercise. Strength training decreased serum B concentration but combined with omega-3 PUFA or antioxidant supplementation, B levels were maintained. Antioxidant supplementation has protective effect after fatigue in isometric exercise but improved appendicular fat-free mass just combined with resistance exercise.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty  accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty  β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty . Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty -induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty  oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty  accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573844>No evidence of attenuation of placental insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and amino  transport in  and gestational diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Pregnancies complicated by  and/or gestational diabetes (GDM) are associated with peripheral insulin resistance, however the insulin responsiveness of the placenta in these pregnancy complications remains largely unknown.

Resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, has been reported to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation. However, the effect of resveratrol on human visceral preadipocyte (HPA-v) differentiation remains largely unknown. LIM domain only 3 (LMO3) promotes human preadipocyte differentiation by enhancing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) transcriptional activity, which is the master regulator of adipogenesis. The purpose of our study was to determine the effect of resveratrol (0-50 μM) on HPA-v proliferation and differentiation, and the role of LMO3 in resveratrol-mediated regulation of HPA-v differentiation. Resveratrol inhibited HPA-v proliferation and differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of PPARG, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPA), fatty -binding protein 4 (FABP4), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and fatty  synthase (FAS) (p < 0.05) at 10, 20, and 50 μM. The mRNA and protein levels of LMO3 were significantly reduced by ≥20 μM resveratrol (p < 0.05), and overexpression of LMO3 partially attenuated resveratrol-induced reduction of HPA-v differentiation by enhancing the PPARG transcriptional activity. Together, our study suggested that resveratrol reduced HPA-v proliferation and differentiation, as well as LMO3, which was partially responsible for the reduction of resveratrol-mediated adipocyte differentiation.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614481>The Regulation of Lipokines by Environmental Factors.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue is a highly metabolically-active tissue that senses and secretes hormonal and lipid mediators that facilitate adaptations to metabolic tissues.

Individual and total SFAs, MUFAs, and n-3 and n-6 PUFAs were analyzed using SD scores and principal component analysis (PCA). Maternal diet, sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors were self-reported. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were assessed in the fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1-rs174556) and 2 (FADS2-rs174575) genes.Fatty  profiles were variable, with individual fatty  proportions varying from 2- to >30-fold between women. Using PCA, we identified 4 milk fatty  patterns: "MUFA and low SFA," "high n-6 PUFA," "high n-3 PUFA," and "high medium-chain fatty ." In multivariable-adjusted analyses, fish oil supplementation and fatty cold water fish intake were positively associated with DHA and the "high n-3 PUFA" pattern. Mothers carrying the minor allele of FADS1-rs174556 had lower proportions of arachidonic  (ARA; 20:4n-6). Independent of selected dietary variables and genetic variants, Asian ethnicity was associated with higher linoleic  (18:2n-6) and total n-3 PUFAs. Ethnic differences in ARA were explained by FADS1 genotype. Maternal  was independently associated with higher total SFAs, the "high medium-chain fatty " pattern, and lower total MUFAs.

NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC).  and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated fatty  and arachidonic  (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C ω3 PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576657>Screening of depression in overweight and obese pregnant women and its predictors.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the screening result of depression and its predictors in overweight and obese pregnant women in second and third trimester of pregnancy.The present cross-sectional study was carried out on 232 overweight or obese pregnant women older than 18 years in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale questionnaire, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Food Record were used. Independent t-test, Man-Whitney U, Pearson and Spearman correlation test, independent t-test, one-way analysis of variance and, multivariate linear regression were applied for data analysis using spss 21.The results of the study showed that the mean (standard deviation) score of depression was 10.1 (4.4), and it was similar in both overweight and obese women (P = 0.784). Median (quartile 25-75) of physical activity was 891.0 (495.0-1336.0) metabolic equivalent of task -min/week. The total physical activity in obese women was statistically higher than overweight ones (P = 0.032). In linear regression model, the variables of parity, body mass index, physical activity education, protein, fat, oleic , monounsaturated fatty , potassium, magnesium, and zinc were the strong predictors of depression, and along with the others explained the 80% of variances.Considering the fact that nearly one-third of overweight and obese women in the present study were positive for depression screening, it is important to pay attention to strong predictors of depression in these women.© 2019 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618136>Novel Invasive and Noninvasive Cardiac-Specific Biomarkers in  and Cardiovascular Diseases.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of fatality and disability worldwide regardless of gender.  has reached epidemic proportions in population across different regions.

This review has examined the evidence for the presence of traditional cardiac biomarkers (nonspecific; lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, myoglobulin, glycogen phosphorylase isoenzyme BB, myosin light chains, ST2, and ischemia-modified albumin) and novel emerging cardiac-specific biomarkers (cardiac troponins, natriuretic peptides, heart-type fatty -binding protein, and miRNAs). Besides, noninvasive anatomical and electrophysiological markers (carotid intima-media thickness, coronary artery calcification, and heart rate variability) in CVDs and  are also discussed. Modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome in the progression of CVD, such as , diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, and adipocytokines are also outlined. These underlying prognostic risk factors predict the onset of future microvascular and macrovascular complications.

In the mammalian intestine, apical sodium-dependent bile  cotransporter (ASBT; SLC10A2) is exclusively responsible for the reabsorption of bile  in the terminal ileum. In rat and mice models of  and importantly in obese humans, ASBT was increased in ileal villus cells. The mechanism of stimulation of ASBT was secondary to an increase in ASBT expression in villus cell brush border membrane. The stimulation of ASBT was not secondary to the altered Na-extruding capacity of villus cells during . Further, increased Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) expression in villus cells during  likely mediated the increase in ASBT. Moreover, enhanced FXR expression increased the expression of bile--associated proteins (IBABP and OSTα) that are responsible for handling bile  absorbed via ASBT in villus cells during .

In this study, we aimed to understand the effects of low-dose Bisphenol-A on the human mature adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells, obtained from subcutaneous mammary adipose tissue of overweight female patients, undergoing surgical mammary reduction. 24 and/or 48 hours exposure to BPA 0.1 nM elicited significant increase of the inflammatory molecules interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), Monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1α (MCP1α) and induced G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 30 (GPR30) levels more than 2-fold both in mature adipocytes and SVF cells. These effects were similar to that obtained in presence of GPR30-specific agonist G1 (100 nM) and were reverted by G15 (1 µM), a GPR30-selective antagonist. As a result of BPA-GPR30 signaling activation, Fatty  Synthase (FAS) and leptin mRNA levels were significantly higher upon BPA exposure (p<0.05) in mature adipocytes, with an opposite effect on adiponectin (ADIPOQ). In addition, an increase in SVF cell proliferation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, was observed, compared to untreated cells. G15 reverted all of these effects. Interestingly, the action of BPA on SVF cell growth was mimicked by IL-8 treatment and was reverted by incubation with anti-IL8 antibodies. All these data suggest that BPA at 0.1nM, a 10 times lower concentration than environmental exposure, increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines via GPR30 both in mature mammary adipocytes and in SVF cells with a possible involvement of IL-8.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545909>Fuzhu jiangtang granules combined with metformin reduces insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of diabetic rats via PI3K/Akt signaling.</a></h2><p> Fuzhu Jiangtang Granules (FJG) are a traditional Chinese used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. However, the antidiabetic mechanism of FJG is not clear.  This study evaluates and determines the antidiabetic mechanism of FJG using a Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat model.  ZDF (fa/fa) rats were divided into four groups ( = 6): diabetes mellitus (DM), metformin (Met, 0.134 g/kg b.w./day), FJG (0.64 g/kg b.w./day), and combination (Com, 0.134 g/kg b.w./day of Met and 0.64 g/kg b.w./day of FJG). Six ZDF (fa/+) rats served as a normal control. After 6 weeks, biochemical parameters gene and protein expression were detected.  The FBG, bodyweight, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free fatty  (FFA), insulin levels, and HOMA-IR were lower in the FJG than in the DM group ( < 0.05,  < 0.01). In an oral glucose tolerance test, the AUC in the FJG group was significantly lower ( < 0.01). The levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase were higher in the FJG than in the DM group ( < 0.01); the malondialdehyde content and TNF-α were significantly decreased in the FJG group ( < 0.01). FJG increased the mRNA expression of IR and GLUT4 significantly ( < 0.05,  < 0.01). The protein levels of IR, p-IRS1 tyr989, m-PI3Kp85, p-Akt and GLUT4 were increased in the FJG ( < 0.05,  < 0.01), but the protein levels of p-IRS1 ser1101/612/307 were significantly decreased in the JG group ( < 0.01).

We selected studies that provided data on SCFA levels or fecal microbiota abundance in obese and nonobese individuals and then combined the published estimates using a random-effects meta-analysis. Obese individuals had significantly higher fecal concentrations of acetate (SMD (standardized mean differences) = 0.87, 95% CI (confidence interva) = 0.24-1.50,  (-squared) = 88.5), propionate (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.35-1.36,  = 82.3%), and butyrate (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.29-1.27,  = 81.7%) than nonobese controls.

As miRNA dysregulation is often associated with various disease patterns, such as , miRNA-27a might therefore be a promising candidate for miRNA mimic replacement therapy by inhibiting adipogenic marker genes. However, application of naked nucleic  faces some limitations concerning poor enzymatic stability, bio-membrane permeation and cellular uptake. To overcome these obstacles, the development of appropriate drug delivery systems (DDS) for miRNAs is of paramount importance.In this work, a triple combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), brightfield (BF) and fluorescence microscopy was used to trace the cellular adhesion of N-TER peptide-nucleic  complexes followed by time-dependent uptake studies using confocal laser scanning microscopy (cLSM). To reveal the biological effect of miRNA-27a on adipocyte development after transfection treatment, Oil-Red-O (ORO)- staining was performed to estimate the degree of in lipid droplets accumulated ORO in mature adipocytes by using light microscopy images as well as absorbance measurements.The present findings demonstrated that amphipathic N-TER peptides represent a suitable DDS for miRNAs by promoting non-covalent complexation through electrostatic interactions between both components as well as cellular adhesion of the N-TER peptide - nucleic  complexes followed by uptake across cell membranes and intracellular release of miRNAs. The anti-adipogenic effect of miRNA-27a in 3T3-L1 cells could be detected in mature adipocytes by reduced lipid droplet formation.The present DDS assembled from amphipathic N-TER peptides and miRNAs is capable of inducing the anti-adipogenic effect of miRNA-27a by reducing lipid droplet accumulation in mature adipocytes. With respect to miRNA mimic replacement therapies, this approach might provide new therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat  and -related disorders.© 2019 Schachner-Nedherer et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630081>Role of microRNA-122 in hepatic lipid metabolism of the weanling female rat offspring exposed to prenatal and postnatal caloric restriction.</a></h2><p>We examined the role of hepatocyte micro-RNA-122 and hypothalamic neuropeptides, in weanling (21d) female rats exposed to calorie restriction induced growth restriction either prenatally (IUGR), postnatally (PNGR) or both (IPGR) vs. ad lib fed controls (CON). IUGR were hyperinsulinemic, hyperleptinemic and dyslipidemic with high circulating miR-122. In contrast, PNGR and IPGR displayed insufficient glucose, insulin and leptin amidst high ketones with a dichotomy in circulating miR-122 of PNGR<IPGR = CON. Examination of livers revealed a reduction in miR-122 expression in PNGR and IPGR reflecting the hepatic size. This reduction of hepatic miR-122 was associated with an increase in specific target transcripts (ALDO-A, BCKDK, PPAR-β) and those mediating fatty  oxidation (PGC-1α, CPT-1α), with a concomitant suppression of fatty  and cholesterol synthesizing transcripts (FAS, HMGCR). Functionally, these changes correlated with increased fatty  oxidation and mitochondrial CPT1α enzyme activity ex vivo. In vitro physiologic (serum starvation) and genetic manipulation of miR-122 in H4IIE hepatoma cells revealed fidelity in regulating ALDO-A/BCKDK, but an infidelity in perturbing fatty /cholesterol synthesizing and oxidizing gene transcripts. Nevertheless, changes in endogenous miR-122 maintained singular directionality while altering FAS/HMGCR and CPT-1α/PGC-1α, almost reflecting each other, and thereby maintaining a balance in fatty /cholesterol supply necessary to meet the in vitro demands of these rapidly proliferating transformed cells. Successive microarray based analysis, comparing IPGR to CON demonstrated differential expression of hypothalamic genes mediating cell proliferation and survival, appetite/energy balance, circadian rhythm and /diabetes. We conclude that miR-122 regulates genes mediating fatty /cholesterol metabolism in postnatal female rats, fueling the energy demand.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652837>Deregulated Lysophosphatidic  Metabolism and Signaling in Liver Cancer.</a></h2><p>Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide due to late diagnosis and scarcity of treatment options. The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of  and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic  (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630283>Beneficial effect of ER stress preconditioning in protection against FFA-induced adipocyte inflammation via XBP1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue inflammation is closely associated with the development of  and insulin resistance. Free fatty  (FFAs) are a major inducer of -related insulin resistance. Previously, we reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress potentially mediated retinal inflammation in diabetic retinopathy. The unfolded protein response (UPR) protects cells against damage induced by oxidative stress. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) plays a major role in protecting cells by modulating the UPR. However, the link between ER stress and adipocyte inflammation has been poorly investigated. In the present study, we found that pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a low dose of ER stress inducer tunicamycin inhibited FFA-induced upregulated expression of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, FFAs induced phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB was largely inhibited by pretreatment with tunicamycin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Knockdown of XBP1 by siRNA markedly mitigated the protective effects of preconditioning against inflammation. Conversely, overexpression of XBP1 alleviated FFA-induced phosphorylation of IκB-α, IKKα/β, and NF-κB, which was accompanied by decreased inflammatory cytokine expression. Collectively, these results imply a beneficial role of ER stress preconditioning in protecting against FFA-induced 3T3-L1 adipocyte inflammation, which is likely mediated through inhibition of the IKK/NF-κB pathway via XBP1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649740>The Challenge of Stratifying : Attempts in the Quebec Family Study.</a></h2><p>  is a major health problem worldwide.

Since  has a strong genetic component, we aimed to develop a polygenic risk score (PRS) to stratify  according to the genetic background of the individuals.  A total of 231 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) significantly associated to body mass index (BMI) from 21 genome-wide association studies were genotyped or imputed in 881 subjects from the Quebec Family Study (QFS). The population was randomly split into discovery (80%; n = 704) and validation (20%; n = 177) samples with similar  (BMI ≥ 30) prevalence (27.8% and 28.2%, respectively). Family-based associations with  were tested for every SNP in the discovery sample and a weighed and continuous PRS was constructed. Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to test the association of PRS with  in the QFS discovery sample and validated in the QFS replication sample. Furthermore, the Fatty  Sensor (FAS) Study (n = 141; 27.7%  prevalence) was used as an independent sample to replicate the results.  The linear trend test demonstrated a significant association of PRS with  in the QFS discovery sample (OR = 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14-1.24]; P = 2.0x10). We also found that the  prevalence was significantly greater in the higher PRS quintiles compared to the lowest quintile. Significant and consistent results were obtained in the QFS validation sample for both the linear trend test (OR = 1.16 [95% CI, 1.07-1.26]; P = 6.7x10), and  prevalence across quintiles. These results were partially replicated in the FAS sample (OR = 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.24]; P = 2.2x10). PRS explained 7.5%, 3.2%, and 1.2% of BMI variance in QFS discovery, QFS validation, and FAS samples, respectively.  These results revealed that genetic background in the form of a 231 BMI-associated PRS has a significant impact on , but a limited potential to accurately stratify it.

We correlated participants' percentage of energy intake from saturated fat and free sugar from the FFQ with the DFS scores. To establish test-retest reliability, participants completed the DFS a second time. To investigate convergent validity, we correlated participants' DFS scores with self-reported eating behavior and sensitivity to reward.DFS scores correlated with percentage of energy from free sugar (rs = 0.443) and saturated fatty  (rs =0.258) but not with non-target nutrients. The correlation between DFS scores and percentage energy from free sugar was not moderated by body mass index (BMI), whereas the correlation with percentage energy from saturated fat slightly decreased with BMI. Intra-class correlation as an indicator of test-retest reliability was 0.801. DFS scores correlated significantly with restraint of eating behavior (rs = -0.380) and feelings of hunger (rs = 0.275). Correlations of the DFS score with disinhibited eating and sensitivity to rewards failed to be significant.Our data indicate that the German version of the DFS might be a psychometrically sound self-report instrument to estimate saturated fat and free sugar intake of German adults.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Phthalates are a family of synthetic organic chemicals used in the manufacture of plastics, solvents, and personal care products. These compounds are considered as endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) since they may interfere with the endocrine system and disrupt its physiologic function.The purpose of this work is to synthesize results from published literature on the association between the exposure to phthalates and adiposity in adults and children.We searched PubMed from inception up to 01 August 2019, to retrieve original papers reporting data on the association between EDCs and adiposity, using the following search expression: (("Endocrine disruptor" OR Endocrine disruptor[mh] OR phthalate) AND ( OR Overweight OR BMI OR "Body fat" OR Adipose tissue[mh] OR Body size[mh] OR "body size" OR "body weight" OR Anthropometry OR "anthropometric measures")) AND (humans[mh]). The study variables and characteristics were collected during data extraction, namely the study design, sample, exposure, outcome, descriptive and association measures. Study quality was assessed using the STROBE template for observational studies. Although studies examined several adiposity measures, Body Mass Index (BMI) and Waist Circumference (WC) were the most commonly used, therefore, we used the beta coefficients regarding BMI and WC, and odds ratios when BMI outcome was categorical to perform the meta-analysis. Data from the studies were combined using fixed effects meta-analyses to compute summary regression coefficients or odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the I2 statistic.In the systematic review we found 29 publications addressing the association between phthalate compounds and adiposity. The vast majority of the included studies reported associations that were not statistically significant. For most of the phthalate compounds there were few studies providing compatible measures and therefore it was not possible to combine the results in a meta-analysis. Both for BMI and WC, the meta-analysis for MiBP, MCPP and MbzP showed negative associations and null association for MBP in children, although none of them was significant. For MEP, positive but not significant associations were found both in children and adults. Conversely, for MEHP a negative association was found also in children and adults although it did not reach statistical significance. Only for MECPP a significant association was found for  in adults (OR = 1.67 (95% CI 1.30; 2.16).In general, a positive association between phthalates and adiposity measures was found, especially in adults. However, most of the results did not reach statistical significance and the inconsistencies found between studies did not allow to reach a definitive conclusion.

These pathological conditions involve interactions between environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Recent advances in nutriepigenomics are contributing to clarify the role of some nutritional factors, including dietary fatty  in gene expression regulation. This systematic review assesses currently available information concerning the role of the different fatty  on epigenetic mechanisms that affect the development of chronic diseases or induce protective effects on metabolic alterations.A targeted search was conducted in the PubMed/Medline databases using the keywords "fatty  and epigenetic". The data were analyzed according to the PRISMA-P guidelines.Consumption fatty  like n-3 PUFA: EPA and DHA, and MUFA: oleic and palmitoleic  was associated with an improvement of metabolic alterations. On the other hand, fatty  that have been associated with the presence or development of , T2D, pro-inflammatory profile, atherosclerosis and IR were n-6 PUFA, saturated fatty  (stearic and palmitic), and trans fatty  (elaidic), have been also linked with epigenetic changes.Fatty  can regulate gene expression by modifying epigenetic mechanisms and consequently result in positive or negative impacts on metabolic outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669041>Modulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide production and activity by taurine and taurine-conjugated bile .</a></h2><p>Taurine is a semiessential amino  found at high concentrations in mammalian plasma and cells, where it regulates cellular functions such as ion flux, controls cell volume and serves as a substrate for conjugated bile  (BAs). Exogenous administration of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs have also been implicated in the modulation of cardiovascular functions. This brief review summarizes the role of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in vascular relaxation through the modulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). The effects of taurine on vascular health are controversial. However, in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors, it has been proposed that taurine can increase vascular NO levels by increasing eNOS expression, eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177, NO bioavailability, the level of antioxidative defense, and the l-arginine/NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio. The taurine-conjugated BA-mediated activation of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), G protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5) and/or muscarinic 3 receptor (M3) was also reported to increase vascular NO production. FXR activation increases eNOS expression and may reduce ADMA formation, while TGR5 increases mobilization of Ca and phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt in endothelial cells. Furthermore, taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs might regulate NO synthesis and activity by enhancing HS generation. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in reversing the endothelial dysfunction associated with diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, , malnutrition, and smoking. In addition, taurine-conjugated BAs have emerged as a potential treatment for portal hypertension. Despite these favorable findings, there is a need to further explore the mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the endothelial effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs. Here, we summarize the main findings regarding the effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs on the endothelial dysfunction associated with altered NO metabolism in cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

A dysfunctional lipid metabolism can lead to  and its complications such as hepatic steatosis, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. In our study, the impact of  root ethanol extract (PGH) on lipid excretion and thermogenesis-related markers in diet-induced  mice was analyzed. Our data show that PGH elevated fatty  uptake in epididymal adipose tissue by increasing  and  expression, which led to decreased blood free fatty  concentrations. Moreover, PGH normalized body weight and fat mass in diet-induced obese mice by increasing lipolysis (, , and ) and fatty  oxidation. Changes in the levels of browning-related genes, enzyme activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase, and the overall transcriptome (, , , , and ) led to promote brown adipose tissue-like features (browning) in epididymal white adipose tissue and enhanced energy expenditure.

However, autophagy is also a part of normal cellular physiology that facilitates the turnover of cellular constituents under normal conditions: it can be readily augmented by mild environmental stress; but becomes dysfunctional with severe oxidative stress leading to cellular pathology. The molluscan hepatopancreas or digestive gland provides a versatile and environmentally relevant model to investigate lysosomal autophagy and stress-induced dysfunctional autophagy. This latter process has been implicated in many animal and human disease conditions, including degenerative and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as  related conditions. Many environmental pollutants have also been found to induce dysfunctional autophagy in molluscan hepatopancreatic digestive cells, and in this study, the marine blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis was exposed for 7 days to: 0.1 μM, 1 μM and 10 μM concentrations of fluoranthene and phenanthrene (PAHs); chlorpyrifos and malathion (organophosphorus compounds); atrazine (triazine herbicide); copper (transition metal) and dodecylbenzene sulphonic  (LAS, surfactant). The marine snail or periwinkle, Littorina littorea, was also exposed to phenanthrene, chlorpyrifos and copper. Indices of oxidative stress, cell injury and dysfunctional autophagy were measured (i.e., lysosomal membrane stability, protein carbonyls, lipofuscin, and lysosomal accumulation of lipid or lipidosis). Evidence of oxidative stress, based on the elevation of lipofuscin and protein carbonyls, was found for all compounds tested; with chlorpyrifos being the most toxic to both species. Dysfunctional autophagy was induced by all of the compounds tested in both species, except for atrazine in mussels. This failure of normal autophagy was consistently associated with oxidative stress. Autophagic dysfunction is an important emerging feature in the aetiology of many disease conditions in animals and humans; and an explanatory conceptual mechanistic model has been developed for dysregulation of autophagy in response to oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019.

Since skeletal muscle regenerative capacity is regulated by satellite cells, we aimed to investigate whether a high-fat diet impairs satellite cell function and whether this is linked to fatty  uptake via CD36. We also aimed to determine whether loss of CD36 impacts on muscle redox homeostasis and skeletal muscle regenerative capacity.We studied the impact of a high-fat diet and CD36 deficiency on murine skeletal muscle morphology, redox homeostasis, satellite cell function, bioenergetics and lipid accumulation in the liver. We also determined the effect of CD36 deficiency on skeletal muscle regeneration.High-fat diet increased body weight, intramuscular lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in wild-type mice that were significantly mitigated in CD36-deficient mice. High-fat diet and CD36 deficiency independently attenuated satellite cell function on single fibres and myogenic capacity on primary satellite cells. CD36 deficiency resulted in delayed skeletal muscle regeneration following acute injury with cardiotoxin. CD36-deficient and wild-type primary satellite cells had distinct bioenergetic profiles in response to palmitate. High-fat diet induced hepatic steatosis in both genotypes that was more pronounced in the CD36-deficient mice.This study demonstrates that CD36 deficiency protects against diet-induced , intramuscular lipid deposition and oxidative stress but results in impaired muscle satellite cell function, delayed muscle regeneration and hepatic steatosis.

Two important hubs have emerged, the placenta/prenatal period and the postnatal gut, with alterations in mitochondria functioning crucial in both.Factors acting to regulate mitochondria functioning in ASD across development are reviewed in this article.Decreased vitamin A, and its retinoic  metabolites, lead to a decrease in CD38 and associated changes that underpin a wide array of data on the biological underpinnings of ASD, including decreased oxytocin, with relevance both prenatally and in the gut. Decreased sirtuins, poly-ADP ribose polymerase-driven decreases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), hyperserotonemia, decreased monoamine oxidase, alterations in 14-3-3 proteins, microRNA alterations, dysregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity, suboptimal mitochondria functioning, and decreases in the melatonergic pathways are intimately linked to this. Many of the above processes may be modulating, or mediated by, alterations in mitochondria functioning. Other bodies of data associated with ASD may also be incorporated within these basic processes, including how ASD risk factors such as maternal  and preeclampsia as well as more general prenatal stressors modulate the likelihood of offspring ASD.Such an integrated model of the pathophysiology of ASD has important preventative and treatment implications.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553600>Molecular Dynamics Study of the Hybridization between RNA and Modified Oligonucleotides.</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are attractive drug candidates for many diseases as they can modulate the expression of gene networks. Recently, we discovered that DNAs targeting microRNA-22-3p (miR-22-3p) hold the potential for treating  and related metabolic disorders (type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) by turning fat-storing white adipocytes into fat-burning adipocytes. In this work, we explored the effects of chemical modifications, including phosphorothioate (PS), locked nucleic  (LNA), and peptide nucleic  (PNA), on the structure and energy of DNA analogs by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To achieve a reliable prediction of the hybridization free energy, the AMOEBA polarizable force field and the free energy perturbation technique were employed. The calculated hybridization free energies are generally compatible with previous experiments. For LNA and PNA, the enhanced duplex stability can be explained by the preorganization mechanism, i.e., the single strands adopt stable helical structures similar to those in the duplex. For PS, the S and R isomers (Sp and Rp) have preferences for C2'-endo and C3'-endo sugar puckering conformations, respectively, and therefore Sp is less stable than Rp in DNA/RNA hybrids. In addition, the solvation penalty of Rp accounts for its destabilization effect. PS-LNA is similar to LNA as the sugar puckering is dominated by the locked sugar ring. This work demonstrated that MD simulations with polarizable force fields are useful for the understanding and design of modified nucleic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546972>The Cooperative Induction of CCL4 in Human Monocytic Cells by TNF-α and Palmitate Requires MyD88 and Involves MAPK/NF-κB Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>Chronic low-grade inflammation, also known as metabolic inflammation, is a hallmark of  and parallels with the presence of elevated circulatory levels of free fatty  and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. CCL4/MIP-1β chemokine plays a key role in the adipose tissue monocyte recruitment. Increased circulatory levels of TNF-α, palmitate and CCL4 are co-expressed in . We asked if the TNF-α/palmitate could interact cooperatively to augment the CCL4 production in human monocytic cells and macrophages. THP-1 cells/primary macrophages were co-treated with TNF-α/palmitate and CCL4 mRNA/protein expression was assessed using qRT-PCR/ELISA. TLR4 siRNA, a TLR4 receptor-blocking antibody, XBlue™-defMyD cells and pathway inhibitors were used to decipher the signaling mechanisms. We found that TNF-α/palmitate co-stimulation augmented the CCL4 expression in monocytic cells and macrophages compared to controls ( < 0.05). TLR4 suppression or neutralization abrogated the CCL4 expression in monocytic cells. Notably, CCL4 cooperative induction in monocytic cells was: (1) Markedly less in MyD88-deficient cells, (2) IRF3 independent, (3) clathrin dependent and (4) associated with the signaling mechanism involving ERK1/2, c-Jun, JNK and NF-κB. In conclusion, TNF-α/palmitate co-stimulation promotes the CCL4 expression in human monocytic cells through the mechanism involving a TLR4-MyD88 axis and MAPK/NF-κB pathways. These findings unravel a novel mechanism of the cooperative induction of CCL4 by TNF-α and palmitate which could be relevant to metabolic inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642366>Genetic effects of  gene insertion/deletion (InDel) on fat-tail measurements and growth traits in Tong sheep.</a></h2><p>Tong sheep is a kind of famous fat-tailed sheep in China, which no longer meets market demands because of the large amount of fat deposition in tail.  () gene regulates fatty  transport and fat metabolism to affect  and is also reported to regulate phenotypic traits in healthy animals. To identify the insertion/deletion (InDel) variations of the  gene and evaluate their effects on fat-tail measurements and growth traits, 166 healthy individuals from Tong sheep were identified and analyzed. Herein, 10 novel InDel polymorphisms were founded in the Tong sheep  gene, which displayed intermediate polymorphism (0.25 < PIC < 0.5) and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( > .05). Correlation analysis of 78 Tong sheep phenotypic traits data and InDel polymorphisms showed that eight InDel loci were significantly associated with partial growth traits ( < .05), four InDel loci were significantly correlated with fat-tail measurements ( < .05). In particular, individuals with genotype DD showed better phenotypic traits than individuals with other genotypes at male sheep InDel 5 and InDel 8 loci, which had small tail-fat dimensions while having good growth traits. These results confirmed potential usefulness of  gene in marker-assisted selection programs of Tong sheep breeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577826>Bilirubin reduces visceral  and insulin resistance by suppression of inflammatory cytokines.</a></h2><p>Although previous studies have reported a negative relationship between serum bilirubin concentration and the development of diabetes mellitus (DM), the relationship between bilirubin and insulin resistance has not been thoroughly assessed. This study was designed to determine the relationships between bilirubin, body fat distribution, and adipose tissue inflammation in patients with type 2 DM and the effect of bilirubin in an obese animal model.Body fat distribution was measured using an abdominal dual bioelectrical impedance analyzer in patients with type 2 DM. We also measured glycemic control, lipid profile, serum bilirubin concentration and other clinical characteristics, and determined their relationships with body fat distribution. In the animal study, biliverdin (20 mg/kg daily) was orally administered to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese (DIO) mice for 2 weeks, after which intraperitoneal insulin tolerance testing was performed. Then, adipocyte area, adipocytokine expression, and macrophage polarization were evaluated in epididymal adipose tissues.In the clinical study, univariate analysis showed that a lower bilirubin concentration was significantly correlated with higher body mass index, waist circumference, triglyceride, uric , creatinine, visceral fat area and lower HDL-C. In multivariate analyses, bilirubin concentration significantly correlated with diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, and visceral fat area. However, there was no association between bilirubin concentration and subcutaneous fat area. In the animal study, DIO mice treated with biliverdin had smaller adipocytes than untreated DIO mice and biliverdin improved HFD-induced insulin resistance. Biliverdin treatment reversed the higher gene expression of Cd11c, encoding an M1 macrophage marker, and Tnfa, encoding the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α, in the adipose tissues of DIO mice. These data suggest biliverdin administration alleviates insulin resistance by ameliorating inflammation and the dysregulation of adipocytokine expression in adipose tissues of DIO mice.Bilirubin may protect against insulin resistance by ameliorating visceral  and adipose tissue inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578283>Meclofenamic  promotes cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury by inhibiting fat mass and -associated protein-mediated m6A abrogation in RNA.</a></h2><p>The role of RNA methylation on the sixth N atom of adenylate (m6A) in acute kidney injury (AKI) is unknown. Fat mass and -associated protein (FTO) reverses the m6A modification in cisplatin-induced AKI. Here, we aimed to determine FTO's role in AKI. We induced AKI in c57BL/6 mice by intraperitoneal cisplatin injection and treated the animal with vehicle or an FTO inhibitor meclfemomic  (MA) for 3 days. Moreover, as an in vitro model, human kidney proximal tubular cells (HK2 cells) were treated with cisplatin. We found that the cisplatin treatment reduces FTO expression and increases m6A levels in vivo and in vitro. MA aggravated renal damage and increased apoptosis in cisplatin-treated kidneys, phenotypes that were correlated with reduced FTO expression and increased m6A levels. Moreover, MA promoted apoptosis in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells, which was correlated with the reduced FTO expression and increased m6A in HK2 cells. FTO protein overexpression reduced m6A levels and inhibited apoptosis in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells and also blocked the MA-induced increase in m6A levels and apoptosis rates. In agreement, overexpression of the m6A-generating methyltransferase-like 3 and 14 (METTL3 and METTL14) or siRNA-mediated FTO knockdown promoted apoptosis and enhanced m6A levels in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells. MA increased p53 mRNA and protein levels in AKI both in vitro and in vivo, and FTO overexpression reduced p53 expression and reversed the MA-induced p53 increase in AKI. In conclusion, reduced renal FTO expression in cisplatin-induced AKI increases RNA m6A levels and aggravates renal damages.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599919>A ketone monoester drink reduces the glycemic response to an oral glucose challenge in individuals with : a randomized trial.</a></h2><p>Exogenous ketones make it possible to reach a state of ketosis that may improve metabolic control in humans.The main objective of this study was to determine whether the ingestion of a ketone monoester (KE) drink before a 2-h oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) would lower blood glucose concentrations. Secondary objectives were to determine the impact of KE on nonesterified fatty  (NEFA) concentration and glucoregulatory hormones.We conducted a randomized controlled crossover experiment in 15 individuals with  (mean ± SD age: 47 ± 10 y; BMI: 34 ± 5 kg/m2). After an overnight fast, participants consumed a KE drink [(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate; 0.45 mL/kg body weight] or taste-matched control drink 30 min before completing a 75-g OGTT. Participants and study personnel performing laboratory analyses were blinded to each condition.The KE increased d-β-hydroxybutyrate to a maximum of ∼3.4 mM (P < 0.001) during the OGTT. Compared with the control drink, KE reduced glucose (-11%, P = 0.002), NEFA (-21%, P = 0.009), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (-31%, P = 0.001) areas under the curve (AUCs), whereas glucagon AUC increased (+11%, P = 0.030). No differences in triglyceride, C-peptide, and insulin AUCs were observed after the KE drink. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased after the KE drink (both P < 0.01).A KE drink consumed before an OGTT lowered glucose and NEFA AUCs with no increase in circulating insulin.

In clinical study, we retrospectively reviewed 128 volunteers (73 males, 55 females, aged 29-88 years) and compared their grades of disk degeneration with -related factors such as body weight, BMI, and serum lipid levels. Clinically, the IDD group showed increased age, BMI and serum triglyceride. Triglyceride was a significant risk factor for IDD even after correction for BMI and age (P = 0.007). In  animal model, rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) in order to study its effects on disk metabolism and apoptosis. HFD rats had significantly higher serum levels of lipids, including triglyceride and non-esterified fatty , and showed significantly decreased markers of anabolism, increased catabolism and apoptosis in disk. Finally, rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were stimulated  with a fatty  (palmitic , PA) to gauge its effects on cell metabolism and apoptosis. Cell culture studies showed that NP cells exposed to PA showed increased apoptosis for activation of caspase 3, 7, 9, and PARP, which was primarily via the MAPK signal pathway, especially ERK pathway. In conclusion, hypertriglyceridemia can lead to IDD, independently of age and BMI. Hypertriglyceridemia appears to mediate disk cell apoptosis and matrix catabolism primarily via the ERK pathway.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Chen, Huang, Wang, Shan, Liu, Chen, Li, Fan and Zhao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652636>MicroRNA-29a Suppresses CD36 to Ameliorate High Fat Diet-Induced Steatohepatitis and Liver Fibrosis in Mice.</a></h2><p>MicroRNA-29 (miR-29) has been shown to play a critical role in reducing inflammation and fibrosis following liver injury. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the liver due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with liver fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced  and liver fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro-inflammation markers as  and  within the liver tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and mitochondria DNA content in the liver than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced fatty  translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells.

All of them showed that the type of diet can have an impact on metabolites excreted and therefore can be a useful tool in the nutritional studies related to metabolism and health and disease status. Two studies concerned VOC analysis in inflammatory bowel diseases, and the results showed that VOCs can distinguish active disease from remission; VOC profile is clearly different in patients. In particular, CH 1-pentadecene, 3-methyl-1-butanal, octane, acetic , alpha-pinene, and m-cymene are elevated in active ulcerative colitis. Four studies examined VOCs in gastric and colorectal tumors showing a change in metabolic biomarkers of cancer patients compared to the control group. Finally, the study of VOCs in breast milk has improved the understanding of the potential health risks of exposure of children to chemical pollutants.VOC analysis allowed to highlight differences in behavior, lifestyle, and metabolism of individuals. Analytical methods are continuously developed to allow for better detection and quantification of metabolites, thus enabling the detection of a broader spectrum of pathophysiology and disease biomarkers.Copyright © 2019 Mariangela Rondanelli et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552248>Emerging Roles of Lipophagy in Health and Disease.</a></h2><p>The term lipophagy is used to describe the autophagic degradation of lipid droplets, the main lipid storage organelles of eukaryotic cells. Ever since its discovery in 2009, lipophagy has emerged as a significant component of lipid metabolism with important implications for organismal health.

In the experiment I, the rats were fed with fructose for 8 wks along with allopurinol or benzbromarone at the beginning. In the experiment II, the rats were fed with fructose for 8 wks firstly. And then, these rats were treated with allopurinol or benzbromarone for additional 6 wks.Fructose-fed rats showed hyperuricemia, abdominal  hypertension and an activation in adipose renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Also, fructose-fed rats had higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and more macrophages infiltrating in adipose tissue. In the experiment I, allopurinol and benzbromarone significantly reduced serum uric  at 8 wk. Adipose RAS overactivation, adipose inflammatory responses and the development of  hypertension were all effectively prevented by hyperuricemia inhibition. In the experiment II, 6-wk treatment with allopurinol and benzbromarone significantly decreased serum uric , downregulated adipose RAS, abolished adipose inflammation and improved  hypertension.In conclusion, urate-lowering therapy protects rats against fructose-induced  hypertension. The mechanisms appear to be via downregulated adipose RAS and reduced inflammation in adipose tissue.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635041>Complementary Immunometabolic Effects of Exercise and PPARβ/δ Agonist in the Context of Diet-Induced Weight Loss in Obese Female Mice.</a></h2><p>Regular aerobic exercise, independently of weight loss, improves metabolic and anti-inflammatory states, and can be regarded as beneficial in counteracting -induced low-grade inflammation. However, it is still unknown how exercise alters immunometabolism in a context of dietary changes. Agonists of the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated-Receptor beta/delta (PPARβ/δ) have been studied this last decade as "exercise-mimetics", which are potential therapies for metabolic diseases. In this study, we address the question of whether PPARβ/δ agonist treatment would improve the immunometabolic changes induced by exercise in diet-induced obese female mice, having switched from a high fat diet to a normal diet. 24 mice were assigned to groups according to an 8-week exercise training program and/or an 8-week treatment with 3 mg/kg/day of GW0742, a PPARβ/δ agonist. Our results show metabolic changes of peripheral lymphoid tissues with PPARβ/δ agonist (increase in fatty  oxidation gene expression) or exercise (increase in AMPK activity) and a potentiating effect of the combination of both on the percentage of anti-inflammatory Foxp3+ T cells. Those effects are associated with a decreased visceral adipose tissue mass and skeletal muscle inflammation (TNF-α, Il-6, Il-1β mRNA level), an increase in skeletal muscle oxidative capacities (citrate synthase activity, endurance capacity), and insulin sensitivity. We conclude that a therapeutic approach targeting the PPARβ/δ pathway would improve  treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547309>Dietary Micronutrient Supplementation for 12 Days in Obese Male Mice Restores Sperm Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p>Male , which often co-presents with micronutrient deficiencies, is associated with sub-fertility. Here we investigate whether short-term dietary supplementation of micronutrients (zinc, selenium, lycopene, vitamins E and C, folic , and green tea extract) to obese mice for 12 days (designed to span the epididymal transit) could improve sperm quality and fetal outcomes. Five-week-old C57BL6 males were fed a control diet (CD,  = 24) or high fat diet (HFD,  = 24) for 10 weeks before allocation to the 12-day intervention of maintaining their original diets (CD,  = 12, HFD  = 12) or with micronutrient supplementation (CD + S,  = 12, HFD + S,  = 12). Measures of sperm quality (motility, morphology, capacitation, binding), sperm oxidative stress (DCFDA, MSR, and 8OHdG), early embryo development (2-cell cleavage, 8OHdG), and fetal outcomes were assessed. HFD + S males had reduced sperm intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations and 8OHdG lesions, which resulted in reduced 8OHdG lesions in the male pronucleus, increased 2-cell cleavage rates, and partial restoration of fetal weight similar to controls. Sub-fertility associated with male  may be restored with very short-term micronutrient supplementation that targets the timing of the transit of sperm through the epididymis, which is the developmental window where sperm are the most susceptible to oxidative damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613643>Influence of , Weight Loss, and Free Fatty  on Skeletal Muscle Clock Gene Expression.</a></h2><p>The molecular circadian clock plays a role in metabolic homeostasis. We tested the hypothesis  and systemic factors associated with insulin resistance affect skeletal muscle clock gene expression. We determined clock gene expression in skeletal muscle of obese women (n=5) and men (n=18) before and 6 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery and normal weight controls (women n=6, men n=8). Skeletal muscle clock gene expression was affected by  and weight loss.  mRNA (P=0.05) was increased and  mRNA (P<0.05) was decreased in obese versus normal weight women and restored to control levels after RYGB-induced weight loss. , ,  and  mRNA (P<0.05) was decreased in obese men as compared to normal weight men. Expression of all other clock genes was unaltered by  or weight loss in both cohorts. We correlated clock gene expression with clinical characteristics of the participants. Among the genes studied,  and  expression was inversely correlated with plasma lipids in both cohorts. Circadian time-course studies revealed that core clock genes oscillate over time (P<0.05), with , , , ,  and  expression profiles altered by palmitate treatment. In conclusion, skeletal muscle clock gene expression and function is altered by , coincident with changes in plasma lipid levels. Palmitate exposure disrupts clock gene expression in myotubes, indicating dyslipidemia directly alters the circadian program.

Increasing evidence, however, demonstrates that LDs fulfill a pleiotropy of additional functions. Among them is the modulation of protein as well as lipid homeostasis. Under unfavorable pro-oxidative conditions, proteins can form aggregates which may exceed the overall proteolytic capacity of the proteasome. After stress termination LDs can adjust and support the removal of these aggregates. Additionally, LDs interact with mitochondria, specifically take over certain proteins and thus prevent apoptosis. LDs, which are loaded with these harmful proteins, are subsequently eliminated via lipophagy. Recently it was demonstrated that this autophagic process is a modulator of longevity. LDs do not only eliminate potentially dangerous proteins, but they are also able to prevent lipotoxicity by storing specific lipids. In the present study we used the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae to compare the proteome as well as lipidome of mitochondria and LDs under different conditions: replicative aging, stress and apoptosis. In this context we found an accumulation of proteins at LDs, supporting the role of LDs in proteostasis. Additionally, the composition of main lipid classes such as phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylglycerols, triacylglycerols, ceramides, phosphatidic  and ergosterol of LDs and mitochondria changed during stress conditions and aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601053>Long-Term Saccharin Consumption and Increased Risk of , Diabetes, Hepatic Dysfunction, and Renal Impairment in Rats.</a></h2><p> This study evaluated the effect of chronic consumption of saccharin on important physiological and biochemical parameters in rats.  Male Wistar rats were used in this study and were divided into four groups: A control group and three experimental groups (groups 1, 2, and 3) were treated with different doses of saccharin at 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, respectively. Each experimental group received sodium saccharin once per day for 120 days while the control group was treated with distilled water only. In addition to the evaluation of body weight, blood samples [total protein, albumin, glucose, lipid profile, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine, and uric ] and urine (isoprostane) were collected in zero time, and after 60 and 120 days for biochemical evaluation. Liver (catalase activity) and brain (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, 8-OHdG) tissues were collected at time zero and after 120 days.  The data showed that saccharin at 5 mg/kg increased body weight of treated rats after 60 (59%) and 120 (67%) days of treatment. Increased concentration of serum glucose was observed after treatment with saccharin at 5 (75% and 62%) and 10 mg/kg (43% and 40%) following 60 and 120 days, respectively. The concentration of albumin decreased after treatment with saccharin at 2.5 (34% and 36%), 5 (39% and 34%), and 10 mg/kg (15% and 21%) after 60 and 120 days of treatment, respectively. The activity of LDH and uric  increased proportionally with dosage levels and consumption period. There was an increased concentration of creatinine after treatment with saccharin at 2.5 (125% and 68%), 5 (114% and 45%), and 10 mg/kg (26% and 31%) following 60 and 120 days, respectively. Catalase activity and 8-OHdG increased by 51% and 49%, respectively, following 120 days of treatment with saccharin at 2.5 mg/kg. Elevation in the concentration of isoprostane was observed after treatment with saccharin at all doses.  The administration of saccharin throughout the treatment period was correlated with impaired kidney and liver function. Both hyperglycemic and -inducing side effects were observed. There was an increased oxidative status of the liver, as well as exposure to increased oxidative stress demonstrated through the increased levels of isoprostane, uric , 8-OHdG, and activity of catalase. Therefore, it is suggested that saccharin is unsafe to be included in the diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561124>Gain of Metabolic Benefit with Ablation of miR-149-3p from Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>The global rise in  has become a public health crisis. During the onset of , disrupted catecholamine signals have been described to contribute to excess fat accumulation, however, the molecular and metabolic change of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) upon chronic high-fat feeding has rarely been investigated. Here, we show that chronic high-fat feeding caused a significant decrease in the expression of thermogenic genes and acquisition of partial deleterious features of visceral fat in SAT. Upregulated miR-149-3p was involved in this -induced "visceralization" of SAT via inhibiting PRDM16, a master regulator that promoted SAT thermogenesis. Reduction of miR-149-3p significantly increased PRDM16 expression in SAT, with improved whole-body insulin sensitivity, decreased SAT inflammation, and liver steatosis in high-fat fed mice. These findings provided direct evidence of the anti-obese and anti-diabetic effect of PRDM16 in the obese background for the first time and identified that miR-149-3p could serve as a therapeutic target to protect against diet-induced  and metabolic dysfunctions.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Since it was first described, there has been a constant increase in its incidence and, for now, there are no effective treatments since current approved medications have only shown short-term symptomatic benefits. Therefore, it is imperative to increase efforts in the search for molecules and non-pharmacological strategies that are capable of slowing or stopping the progress of the disease and, ideally, to reverse it. The amyloid cascade hypothesis based on the fundamental role of amyloid has been the central hypothesis in the last 30 years. However, since amyloid-directed treatments have shown no relevant beneficial results other theories have been postulated to explain the origin of the pathology. The brain is a highly metabolically active energy-consuming tissue in the human body. It has an almost complete dependence on the metabolism of glucose and uses most of its energy for synaptic transmission. Thus, alterations on the utilization or availability of glucose may be cause for the appearance of neurodegenerative pathologies like AD. In this review article, the hypothesis known as Type 3 Diabetes (T3D) will be evaluated by summarizing some of the data that has been reported in recent years. According to published research, the adherence over time to low saturated fatty  diets in the context of the Mediterranean diet would reduce the inflammatory levels in brain, with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory glial activation and mitochondrial oxidative stress. In this situation, the insulin receptor pathway would be able to fine tune the mitochondrial biogenesis in neuronal cells, regulation the adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate intracellular balance, and becoming a key factor involved in the preservation of the synaptic connexions and neuronal plasticity. In addition, new targets and strategies for the treatment of AD will be considered in this review for their potential as new pharmacological or non-pharmacological approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552263>Maximizing Post-exercise Anabolism: The Case for Relative Protein Intakes.</a></h2><p>Maximizing the post-exercise increase in muscle protein synthesis, especially of the contractile myofibrillar protein fraction, is essential to facilitate effective muscle remodeling, and enhance hypertrophic gains with resistance training. MPS is the primary regulated variable influencing muscle net balance with dietary amino  ingestion representing the single most important nutritional variable enhancing post-exercise rates of muscle protein synthesis. Dose-response studies in average (i.e., ~80 kg) males have reported an absolute 20 g dose of high quality, rapidly digested protein maximizes mixed, and myofibrillar protein synthetic rates. However, it is unclear if these absolute protein intakes can be viewed in a "one size fits all" solution. Re-analysis of published literature in young adults suggests a relative single meal intake of ~0.31 g/kg of rapidly digested, high quality protein (i.e., whey) should be considered as a nutritional guideline for individuals of average body composition aiming to maximize post-exercise myofibrillar protein synthesis while minimizing irreversible amino  oxidative catabolism that occurs with excessive intakes of this macronutrient. This muscle-specific bolus intake is lower than that reported to maximize whole body anabolism (i.e., ≥0.5 g/kg). Review of the available literature suggests that potential confounders such as the co-ingestion of carbohydrate, sex, and amount of active muscle mass do not represent significant barriers to the translation of this objectively determined relative protein intake. Additional research is warranted to elucidate the effective dose for proteins with suboptimal amino  compositions (e.g., plant-based), and/or slower digestion rates as well as whether recommendations are appreciably affected by other physiological conditions such endurance exercise, high habitual daily protein ingestion, aging, , and/or periods of chronic negative energy balance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651513>Correlation of serum vitamin D, adipose tissue vitamin D receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ in women with gestational diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication during pregnancy.  and overweight are closely related to metabolic diseases and diabetes. However, the role of adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of GDM remains to be studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of vitamin D (VD) levels, VD receptor (VDR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression with GDM in overweight or obese women.One hundred and forty pregnant women with full-term single-birth cesarean-section were selected as the study subjects and grouped (70 GDM women, including 35 non-overweight/non-obese women [group G1] and 35 women with overweight or  [group G2]; 70 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance, including 35 non-overweight/non-obese women [group N1] and 35 overweight/obese women [group N2]). The levels of serum VD, blood biochemistry, and adiponectin were compared in these women. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was isolated from the abdominal wall incision. VDR and PPARγ messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript levels in these adipose tissues were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The differences between the levels of PPARγ protein and phosphorylated PPARγ Ser273 were detected by Western blotting.The serum VD level of GDM women was lower in comparison to that of women with normal glucose tolerance (G1 vs. N1: 20.62 ± 7.87 ng/mL vs. 25.85 ± 7.29 ng/mL, G2 vs. N2: 17.06 ± 6.74 ng/mL vs. 21.62 ± 7.18 ng/mL, P < 0.05), and the lowest in overweight/obese GDM women. VDR and PPARγ mRNA expression was higher in the adipose tissues of GDM women in comparison to that of women with normal glucose tolerance (VDR mRNA: G1 vs. N1: 210.00 [90.58-311.46] vs. 89.34 [63.74-159.92], G2 vs. N2: 298.67 [170.84-451.25] vs. 198.28 [119.46-261.23], PPARγ mRNA: G1 vs. N1: 100.72 [88.61-123.87] vs. 87.52 [66.37-100.04], G2 vs. N2: 117.33 [100.08-149.00] vs. 89.90 [76.95-109.09], P < 0.05), and their expression was the highest in GDM + overweight/obese women. VDR mRNA levels positively correlated with the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), pre-delivery BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and PPARγ mRNA while it negatively correlated with the VD and the adiponectin levels (r = 0.395, 0.336, 0.240, 0.190, 0.235, -0.350, -0.294, respectively, P < 0.05). The degree of PPARγ Ser273 phosphorylation increased in obese and GDM pregnant women. PPARγ mRNA levels positively correlated with pre-pregnancy BMI, pre-delivery BMI, FBG, HOMA-IR, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, free fatty , and VDR mRNA, while it negatively correlated with the VD and adiponectin levels (r = 0.276, 0.199, 0.210, 0.230, 0.182, 0.214, 0.270, 0.235, -0.232, -0.199, respectively, P < 0.05).Both GDM and overweight/obese women had decreased serum VD levels and up-regulated VDR and PPARγ mRNA expression in adipose tissue, which was further higher in the overweight or obese women with GDM. VD may regulate the formation and differentiation of adipocytes through the VDR and PPARγ pathways and participate in the occurrence of GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599476>Effects of secukinumab on metabolic and liver parameters in plaque psoriasis patients.</a></h2><p>Psoriasis is associated with metabolic, liver and cardiovascular comorbidity. Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes interleukin-17A (IL-17A), has shown significant and sustained efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.This was an exploratory post hoc analysis of pooled data from three phase 3 studies in plaque psoriasis patient populations. The objective was to show the course of metabolic and liver parameters under secukinumab, etanercept, or placebo treatment over time. A further objective was to assess the impact of selected comorbidities and metabolic characteristics on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), as a surrogate marker of systemic inflammation.Data from the phase 3 randomised controlled trials (FIXTURE [], ERASURE [], and SCULPTURE []; n=3010) were included in this analysis. Patients were treated with secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg, placebo or etanercept 50 mg (FIXTURE only) as active comparator. A set of metabolic and liver parameters was longitudinally assessed over 52 weeks. Multivariate regression analyses assessed the impact of selected comorbidities and metabolic characteristics on hs-CRP levels at baseline and under treatment.Secukinumab treatment reduced hs-CRP levels. Body weight and uric  levels tended to decrease over 52 weeks with secukinumab. Secukinumab showed a neutral effect on fasting plasma glucose, lipid parameters and liver enzymes. Psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome, , impaired glucose metabolism, and hyperuricemia were each associated with increased hs-CRP levels at baseline. Concomitant  attenuated the decline in hs-CRP under treatment.These analyses suggest neutral to favourable long term trends in metabolic and liver parameters under secukinumab treatment. Metabolic comorbidities were associated with increased hs-CRP levels, reflecting the role of systemic inflammatory processes in their pathophysiology.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614852>Grape Seeds Proanthocyanidins: An Overview of In Vivo Bioactivity in Animal Models.</a></h2><p>Over the last decade, proanthocyanidins (PACs) are attracting attention not only from the food industry but also from public health organizations due to their health benefits. It is well-known that grapes are a good source of PACs and for that reason, the industry is also focused on grape by-products identification and bioactivity evaluation. Grape seeds extract (GSPE) is a rich source of PACs, mainly composed of monomeric catechin and epicatechin, gallic  and polymeric and oligomeric proanthocyanidins. Thus, this review encompasses the state-of-art structure and the most recent evidence about the impact of GSPE on chronic diseases, with a focus on oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolic syndrome (MeS)-related disorders such as , diabetes and cardiovascular risk disease in vivo to offer new perspectives in the field that allow further research. Despite the controversial results, is undeniable that PACs from grape seeds are highly antioxidants, thus, the capacity of GSPE to improve oxidative stress might mediate the inflammation process and the progress of MeS-related pathologies. However, further well-design animal studies with standardized dosages and GSPE composition are necessary to shed light into the cause-effect relationship in a more accurate way to later allow a deeper study of the effect of GSPE in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617618>Immunoreactive insulin stability in horses at risk of insulin dysregulation.</a></h2><p>Diseases associated with insulin dysregulation (ID), such as equine metabolic syndrome and pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction, are of interest to practitioners because of their association with laminitis.

Blood samples were divided into ethylenediaminetetraacetic , heparinized, or serum tubes and stored at 4 or 20°C. Tubes were centrifuged and analyzed for insulin by a chemiluminescent assay over 8 days. Changes in insulin concentrations were compared with a linear mixed effects model.An overall effect of time, tube type and temperature was identified (P = .01, P = 0.001, and P = 0.001, respectively). Serum and heparinized samples had similar concentrations for 3 days at 20°C and 8 days at 4°C; however, after 3 days at 20°C, heparinized samples had significantly higher insulin concentrations (P = .004, P = .03, and P = .03 on consecutive days). Ethylenediaminetetraacetic  samples had significantly lower insulin concentrations regardless of time and temperature (P = .001 for all comparisons).These results suggest an ideal protocol to determine insulin concentrations involves using serum or heparinized samples with analysis occurring within 3 days at 20°C or 8 days at 4°C.© 2019 The Authors.

However, leucine-related effects in tumour tissues are still poorly understood. Thus, we described the effects of leucine in both in vivo and in vitro models of a Walker-256 tumour. Tumour-bearing Wistar rats were randomly distributed into a control group (W; normoprotein diet) and leucine group (LW; leucine-rich diet [normoprotein + 3% leucine]). After 20 days of tumour evolution, the animals underwent -fludeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (F-FDG PET-CT) imaging, and after euthanasia, fresh tumour biopsy samples were taken for oxygen consumption rate measurements (Oroboros Oxygraph), electron microscopy analysis and RNA and protein extraction. Our main results from the LW group showed no tumour size change, lower tumour glucose (F-FDG) uptake, and reduced metastatic sites. Furthermore, leucine stimulated a shift in tumour metabolism from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, higher mRNA and protein expression of oxidative phosphorylation components, and enhanced mitochondrial density/area even though the leucine-treated tumour had a higher number of apoptotic nuclei with increased oxidative stress. In summary, a leucine-rich diet directed Walker-256 tumour metabolism to a less glycolytic phenotype profile in which these metabolic alterations were associated with a decrease in tumour aggressiveness and reduction in the number of metastatic sites in rats fed a diet supplemented with this branched-chain amino .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591364>Recent Advances in  Phytochemistry and Biological Activity: A Comprehensive Review.</a></h2><p>Plants belonging to the genus  (family: Zingiberaceae) are distributed in Asia, especially in the southeast region, and Thailand.

A high-lard diet is widely used to induce  in model animal experiments, which also leads to anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors. However, the contribution of dietary fat source to these abnormal behaviors in  is largely unknown.Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with different types of high-fat (lard and olive oil) diet with high sucrose for more than 8 weeks. Anxiety-like behavior (open-field and social interaction tests) and cognitive function (Y-maze test) after the treatment were analyzed. The expression of mRNA related to neurotransmitter and nutrient transporters in the prefrontal cortex were determined using real-time PCR. Serum lipid species were determined using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.Both high-fat/high-sucrose diets increased body weight (BW), adipose tissue, and serum leptin level. However, the high-lard/high-sucrose (HL/HS), but not high-olive oil/HS, diet induced anxiety-like behavior in open field and social interaction tests. BW and endocrine hormones such as leptin and insulin were not correlated to anxiety-like behavior. HL/HS diet induced an increase in glutamate transporter and a decrease of glutamate receptor mRNA expressions in the prefrontal cortex. Further, serum lysophosphatidyl choline conjugated with several fatty  was decreased by HL/HS diet. LPC conjugated with eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) was strongly correlated with anxiety-like behavior.These results suggest that lipid composition, rather than  per se, is a major cause of anxiety-like behavior in high-fat diet-induced .

Additionally, the binding of FAs to nuclear receptors may have persistent intergenerational, extranutritive endocrinological effects that interact with the actions of reproductive steroids causing sex-dependent effects. To determine the role of FA type in the effects underlying maternal HFD, we fed wild-type C57BL6/J mating pairs, from preconception through lactation, a HFD with high saturated fat levels from coconut oil or high linoleic  (LA) levels from vegetable oil. Male and female offspring body weight and food intake were measured weekly for 25 weeks. Assays for glucose metabolism, body composition, and calorimetry were performed at 25 weeks. Plasma metabolic peptides and liver mRNA were measured terminally.  was primarily affected by adult rather than maternal diet in males, yet in females, maternal HFD potentiated the effects of adult HFD. Maternal HFD high in LA impaired glucose disposal in males weaned onto HFD and insulin sensitivity of females. Plasma leptin correlated with adiposity, but insulin and insulin receptor expression in the liver were altered by maternal LA in males. Our results suggest that maternal FA profile is most influential on offspring glucose metabolism and that adult diet is more important than maternal diet for  and other parameters of metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662903>Are Nonnutritive Sweeteners Obesogenic?

We have previously shown that exercise may amplify energy expenditure through energetically expensive nutrient deposition. Therefore, we investigated the effect of exercise on hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) during WLM and relapse to . Obese rats were calorically restricted with (EX) or without (SED) treadmill exercise (1 h/day, 6 days/wk, 15 m/min) to induce and maintain weight loss. After 6 wk of WLM, subsets of WLM-SED and WLM-EX rats were allowed ad libitum access to food for 1 day to promote relapse (REL). An energy gap-matched group of sedentary, relapsing rats (REL-GM) were provided a diet matched to the positive energy imbalance of the REL-EX rats. During relapse, exercise increased enrichment of hepatic DN-derived lipids and induced hepatic molecular adaptations favoring DNL compared with the gap-matched controls. In the liver, compared with both REL-SED and REL-GM rats, REL-EX rats had lower hepatic expression of genes required for cholesterol biosynthesis; greater hepatic expression of genes that mediate very low-density lipoprotein synthesis and secretion; and greater mRNA expression of , which encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of bile . Altogether, these data provide compelling evidence that the liver has an active role in exercise-mediated potentiation of energy expenditure during early relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592057>Curcumin may induce lipolysis via proteo-stress in Huh7 human hepatoma cells.</a></h2><p>Curcumin has been shown to have anti- effects in animal studies. Although several molecular mechanisms of action have been reported, the initial or upstream molecular events remain to be revealed. In this study, we found that curcumin or heat shock treatment up-regulated the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in Huh7 hepatoma cells, which resulted in acceleration of lipolysis. Interestingly, perturbation of protein homeostasis was seen in curcumin-treated cells, as detected by formation of numerous ubiquitinated proteins and conjugated proteins with p62 (SQSTM). Curcumin activated the protein expression of molecular chaperones, such as heat shock protein (HSP)40 and HSP70. Pre-treatment of the cells with 4-phenylbutyric , a chemical chaperone, suppressed proteo-stress induced by curcumin and reduced its lipolysis effect. Importantly, the cytotoxicity of curcumin was markedly alleviated when intracellular triglyceride was consumed by the polyphenol. Thus, energy supplementation from lipolysis may play substantial roles in adaptation and survival of curcumin-exposed cells. To support this notion, the cytotoxicity of curcumin was aggravated in ATGL-knockdown cells. Curcumin decreased intracellular ATP for activating AMP-activated protein kinase, which initiates catabolic pathways including ATGL-dependent lipolysis. Taken together, we propose a hypothesis that curcumin induces lipolysis to compensate for ATP reduction due to its proteo-stress effects.Copyright © 2019 JCBNCopyright © 2019 JCBN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671360>Inter-correlated gut microbiota and SCFAs changes upon antibiotics exposure links with rapid body-mass gain in weaned piglet model.</a></h2><p>The risk of overweight or  in association with early exposure of antibiotics remains an important public issue for health-care of children. Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal microbiota were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty  (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic microbiota to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

LC-PUFAs are structural constituents of the central nervous system (CNS), being essential in retinal development or hippocampal plasticity. Recently, components of the milk fat globule membrane (MFG) are being added to infant formulas because of their key role in infant's development. A high intake of proteins induces a faster weight gain during infancy which correlates with later . Digestible carbohydrates provide glucose, crucial for an adequate functioning of CNS; nondigestible carbohydrates [e.g. human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs)] are the main carbon source for gut bacteria. Iron-deficiency anemia during infancy has been associated with alterations of mental and psychomotor development. Folate metabolism, closely related to vitamins B6 and B12, controls epigenetic changes, whereas inadequate status of vitamin D affects bone development, but may also increase intestinal permeability and alter gut microbiota composition.LC-PUFAs, proteins, carbohydrates, iron, and vitamins during early life are critical for infant's growth, neurodevelopment, and the establishment and functioning of gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621967>Fructose metabolism as a common evolutionary pathway of survival associated with climate change, food shortage and droughts.</a></h2><p>Mass extinctions occur frequently in natural history. While studies of animals that became extinct can be informative, it is the survivors that provide clues for mechanisms of adaptation when conditions are adverse. Here, we describe a survival pathway used by many species as a means for providing adequate fuel and water, while also providing protection from a decrease in oxygen availability. Fructose, whether supplied in the diet (primarily fruits and honey), or endogenously (via activation of the polyol pathway), preferentially shifts the organism towards the storing of fuel (fat, glycogen) that can be used to provide energy and water at a later date. Fructose causes sodium retention and raises blood pressure and likely helped survival in the setting of dehydration or salt deprivation. By shifting energy production from the mitochondria to glycolysis, fructose reduced oxygen demands to aid survival in situations where oxygen availability is low. The actions of fructose are driven in part by vasopressin and the generation of uric . Twice in history, mutations occurred during periods of mass extinction that enhanced the activity of fructose to generate fat, with the first being a mutation in vitamin C metabolism during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (65 million years ago) and the second being a mutation in uricase that occurred during the Middle Miocene disruption (12-14 million years ago). Today, the excessive intake of fructose due to the availability of refined sugar and high-fructose corn syrup is driving 'burden of life style' diseases, including , diabetes and high blood pressure.© 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610370>GABA Receptor Signaling in the Mesolimbic System Suppresses Binge-like Consumption of a High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>Binge eating could contribute to the development of , and previous studies suggest that gamma-aminobutyric  (GABA) type B receptor (GABAR) signaling is involved in the regulation of binge eating. Here, we show that time-restricted access to a high-fat diet (HFD) induces binge-like eating behavior in wild-type mice. HFD consumption during restricted time was significantly increased in corticostriatal neuron-specific GABAR-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, the GABAR agonist baclofen suppressed HFD intake during restricted time in wild-type mice but not in corticostriatal or dopaminergic neuron-specific GABAR-deficient mice. In contrast, there were no significant differences in food consumption among genotypes under ad libitum access to HFD.

Avocados have an additional LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering effect beyond that observed when their MUFAs are substituted for SFAs, especially on small, dense LDL (sdLDL) particles, which are susceptible to in vivo oxidation and associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).We investigated whether a healthy diet with 1 avocado daily decreased the following secondary outcomes: circulating oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and related oxidative stress markers.A randomized, crossover, controlled feeding trial was conducted with 45 men and women, aged 21-70 y, with overweight or  and elevated LDL-C (25th-90th percentile). Three cholesterol-lowering diets were provided (5 wk each) in random sequences: a lower-fat (LF) diet (24% calories from fat-7% SFAs, 11% MUFAs, 6% PUFAs) and 2 moderate-fat (MF) diets (34% calories from fat-6% SFAs, 17% MUFAs, 9% PUFAs): the avocado (AV) diet included 1 Hass avocado (∼136 g) per day, and the MF diet used high oleic  oils to match the fatty  profile of 1 avocado.

Statins prevent endothelial dysfunction and decrease cardiovascular risk in patients with  and diabetes. However, it remains unclear whether statin treatment for -induced endothelial barrier dysfunction is in part due to the blockade of Nlrp3 inflammasome signaling axis. The results showed that simvastatin, a clinically and widely used statin, prevented free fatty -induced endothelial hyperpermeability and disruption of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin junctions in mouse microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs). This protective effect of simvastatin was largely due to improved lysosome function that attenuated lysosome injury-mediated Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and subsequent release of high mobility group box protein-1 (HMGB1). Mechanistically, simvastatin induces autophagy that promotes removal of damaged lysosomes and also promotes lysosome regeneration that preserves lysosome function.

We have previously shown that exposure to a low-protein diet during gestation was associated with upregulation of genes associated with cholesterol transport and packaging within the placenta. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of altering maternal dietary linoleic  (LA; omega-6) to alpha-linolenic  (ALA; omega-6) ratios as well as total fat content on placental expression of genes associated with cholesterol transport. The potential for maternal body mass index (BMI) to be associated with expression of these genes in human placental samples was also evaluated. Placentas were collected from 24 Wistar rats at 20-day gestation (term = 21-22-day gestation) that had been fed one of four diets containing varying fatty  compositions during pregnancy, and from 62 women at the time of delivery. Expression of 14 placental genes associated with cholesterol packaging and transfer was assessed in rodent and human samples by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. In rats, placental mRNA expression of ApoA2, ApoC2, Cubn, Fgg, Mttp and Ttr was significantly elevated (3-30 fold) in animals fed a high LA (36% fat) diet, suggesting increased cholesterol transport across the placenta in this group. In women, maternal BMI was associated with fewer inconsistent alterations in gene expression. In summary, sub-optimal maternal nutrition is associated with alterations in the expression of genes associated with cholesterol transport in a rat model. This may contribute to altered fetal development and potentially programme disease risk in later life.

We thus generated fatty -binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high-fat diet (HFD) and showed increased insulin sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired browning program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor.

Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic . Saturated palmitic  impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic  did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic  induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation.

The current study characterized the glucose metabolism in lean mice in which the genetic deletion of PP2Cm leads to moderate BCAA catabolic defect. Interestingly, compared to the wildtype control, lean PP2Cm deficient mice showed enhanced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, lower body weight, and the preference for carbohydrate over lipids utilization. Metabolomics profiling of plasma and tissues revealed significantly different metabolic patterns in the PP2Cm deficient mice, featured by the marked alterations in glucose metabolic processes, including gluconeogenesis/glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and tricarboxylic  cycle. The metabolic changes of glucose were predominantly observed in liver but not skeletal muscle or white adipose tissue. The elevated branched-chain keto  (BCKAs) resulted from the BCAA catabolic defect may play a critical role in regulating the expression of key regulators of glucose metabolic processes and the activity of respiratory Complex II/succinate dehydrogenase in TCA cycle.

Additionally, MaR1 effects are tested in mouse primary hepatocytes, HepG2 human hepatocytes, C2C12 myotubes, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In DIO mice, MaR1 decreases circulating FGF21 levels and HFD-induced hepatic Fgf21 mRNA expression. MaR1 increases hepatic β-Klotho, Egr1, and cFos in DIO mice. In WAT, MaR1 counteracts the HFD-induced downregulation of Fgf21, Fgfr1, and β-Klotho. In muscle, MaR1 does not modify Fgf21 but promoted Fgfr1 expression. In mouse primary hepatocytes, MaR1 decreases Fgf21 expression and downregulated Pparα mRNA levels. In HepG2 cells, MaR1 reverses the increased production of FGF21 and the downregulation of FGFR1, Β-KLOTHO, EGR1, and cFOS induced by palmitate.

To understand how these interactions contribute to metabolic homeostasis and disease states, we analysed the steady state response of metabolic regulation (catabolic or anabolic) with respect to structural and input perturbations in the integrated signalling network, for varying levels of plasma glucose. Structural perturbations revealed: the positive feedback of AKT on IRS is responsible for the bistability in anabolic zone (glucose >5.5 mmol); the positive feedback of calcium on cAMP is responsible for ensuring ultrasensitive response in catabolic zone (glucose <4.5 mmol); the crosstalk between AKT and PDE3 is responsible for efficient catabolic response under low glucose condition; the crosstalk between DAG and PKC regulates the span of anabolic bistable region with respect to plasma glucose levels. The macronutrient perturbations revealed: varying plasma amino  and fatty  from normal to high levels gradually shifted the bistable response towards higher glucose range, eventually making the response catabolic or unresponsive to increasing glucose levels. The analysis reveals that certain macronutrient composition may be more conducive to homeostasis than others.

It directly increases the risk for insulin resistance, mainly via hormone activation, and may indirectly cause insulin resistance due to its effects on abdominal . Nicotine may be the factor underlying these potential mechanisms. With the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes on the rise, and considering the role of smoking and its relationship to insulin resistance, smoking reduction or cessation may be a viable option for those who are at risk or already identified as insulin resistant. Therefore, smoking cessation or reduction would serve as a beneficial component in any diabetes prevention or treatment plan.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562952>The effects of Vitis vinifera L. phenolic compounds on a blood-brain barrier culture model: Expression of leptin receptors and protection against cytokine-induced damage.</a></h2><p>The medicinal properties of grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) are well known since ancient times. Ethnobotanical grape preparations, like the Ayurvedic Darakchasava are used as cardiotonic and for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Dried grape products are also applied in Iranian traditional medicine for memory problems, which are linked to the pathology of brain microvessels, a special part of the cardiovascular system. The anti-inflammatory and protective effects of these traditional preparations on the cardiovascular system are related to their bioactive phenolic compounds.The blood-brain barrier (BBB), formed by brain capillaries, is not only involved in inflammatory and other diseases of the central nervous system, but also in many systemic diseases with an inflammatory component. Dietary  is a systemic chronic inflammatory condition in which the peripheral and central vascular system is affected. Among the cerebrovascular changes in  defective leptin transport across the BBB related to central leptin resistance is observed. Our aim was to study the protective effects of grape phenolic compounds epicatechin (EC), gallic  (GA) and resveratrol (RSV) and grape-seed proanthocyanidin-rich extract (GSPE) on a cytokine-induced vascular endothelial inflammation model. Using a culture model of the BBB we investigated cytokine-induced endothelial damage and changes in the expression of leptin receptors and leptin transfer.For the BBB model, primary cultures of rat brain endothelial cells, glial cells and pericytes were used in co-culture. Cells were treated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) (10 ng/ml each) to induce damage. Cell toxicity was evaluated by the measurement of impedance. The expression of leptin receptors was assessed by RT-qPCR and western blot. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) were detected by fluorescent probes.GSPE (10 μg/ml), EC (10 μM), GA (1 μM) or RSV (10 μM) did not change the viability of brain endothelial cells. The gene expression of the short leptin receptor isoform, Ob-Ra, was up-regulated by GSPE, EC and RSV, while the mRNA levels of Lrp2 and clusterin, clu/ApoJ were not affected. The tested compounds did not change the expression of the long leptin receptor isoform, Ob-Rb. RSV protected against the cytokine-induced increase in albumin permeability of the BBB model. GSPE and EC exerted an antioxidant effect and GSPE increased NO both alone and in the presence of cytokines. The cytokine-induced nuclear translocation of transcription factor NF-κB was blocked by GSPE, GA and RSV. Cytokines increased the mRNA expression of Lrp2 which was inhibited by EC. RSV increased Ob-Ra and Clu in the presence of cytokines. Cytokines elevated leptin transfer across the BBB model, which was not modified by GSPE or RSV.Our results obtained on cell culture models confirm that natural grape compounds protect vascular endothelial cells against inflammatory damage in accordance with the ethnopharmacological use of grape preparations in cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, grape compounds and GSPE, by exerting a beneficial effect on the BBB, may also be considered in the treatment of  after validation in clinical trials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a flavin-dependent monoamine oxidase that can demethylate mono- and dimethylated histone lysines 4 and 9 (H3K4 and H3K9). The removal of methyl groups from the lysine residues of histone and non-histone proteins was found to be an important regulatory factor of cell proliferation. However, its role has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we assessed LSD1-mediated cell cycle progression using a human endothelial cell model. The short hairpin RNA knockdown of LSD1 inhibits the G/M phase of cell cycle progression by checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) phosphorylation (S137). We observed elevated DNA damage, which was consistent with the increased detection of double-strand breaks as well as purines and pyrimidines oxidation, which accompanied the activation of ATR/ATRIP signaling by H2AXS139 phosphorylation. The irreversible pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 by 2-phenylcyclopropylamine (2-PCPA) inactivated its enzymatic activity, causing significant changes in heterochromatin and euchromatin conformation assessed by chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit A (CAF1A) and heterochromatin protein 1 isoform α and γ (HP1α/γ) immunofluorescence analysis. We conclude that the knockdown of LSD1 in endothelial cells leads to increased HP1-positive chromatin, the stimulation of DNA repair processes, and the dysregulation of proliferation machinery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551469>Genetic architecture of human plasma lipidome and its link to cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Understanding genetic architecture of plasma lipidome could provide better insights into lipid metabolism and its link to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Here, we perform genome-wide association analyses of 141 lipid species (n = 2,181 individuals), followed by phenome-wide scans with 25 CVD related phenotypes (n = 511,700 individuals). We identify 35 lipid-species-associated loci (P <5 ×10), 10 of which associate with CVD risk including five new loci-COL5A1, GLTPD2, SPTLC3, MBOAT7 and GALNT16 (false discovery rate<0.05). We identify loci for lipid species that are shown to predict CVD e.g., SPTLC3 for CER(d18:1/24:1). We show that lipoprotein lipase (LPL) may more efficiently hydrolyze medium length triacylglycerides (TAGs) than others. Polyunsaturated lipids have highest heritability and genetic correlations, suggesting considerable genetic regulation at fatty  levels. We find low genetic correlations between traditional lipids and lipid species. Our results show that lipidomic profiles capture information beyond traditional lipids and identify genetic variants modifying lipid levels and risk of CVD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616017>Short-term effects of Vertical sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on glucose homeostasis.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to compare the biochemical changes related to glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism in non-diabetic patients shortly after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Non-diabetic women and men with morbid  were studied the day before and six days after SG (N = 15) or RYGB (N = 16). Patients completed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 75 g glucose) at both visits. SG and RYGB similarly improved fasting glucose homeostasis six days after surgery, with reduced glucose and insulin concentrations. The OGTT revealed differences between the two surgery groups that were not evident from the fasting serum concentrations. Postprandial (120 min) glucose and insulin concentrations were lower after RYGB but not after SG, whereas concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY, glucagon and non-esterified fatty  were elevated after both SG and RYGB. Fasting triacylglycerol concentration did not change after surgery, but concentrations of high density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein cholesterols were reduced in both surgery groups, with no differences between the groups. To conclude, RYGB induced a more pronounced improvement in postprandial glucose homeostasis relative to SG, possibly due to improved insulin sensitivity rather than augmented insulin concentration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584650>Nutritional strategies to modulate inflammation pathways via regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ.</a></h2><p>The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) β/δ has an important role in multiple inflammatory conditions, including , hypertension, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune diseases. PPARβ/δ forms a heterodimer with the retinoic  receptor and binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements to initiate transcription of its target genes. PPARβ/δ is also able to suppress the activities of several transcription factors, including nuclear factor κB, and activator protein 1, thus regulating anti-inflammatory cellular responses and playing a protective role in several diseases. Recent studies have shown that nutritional compounds, including nutrients and bioactive compounds, can regulate PPARβ/δ expression. This review discusses key nutritional compounds that are known to modulate PPARβ/δ and are likely to affect human health.© The Author(s) 2019.

The microbiota degrades and ferments substrates, producing characteristic short chain fatty  profiles. Dietary fibre contains plant cell wall-associated polysaccharides (hemicelluloses, pectins) that are chemically diverse in composition and structure. Thus, depending on plant sources, dietary fiber daily presents the microbiota with mixtures of plant polysaccharides of varying types and complexity. We studied the extent and preferential order in which mixtures of plant polysaccharides (arabinoxylan, xyloglucan, β-glucan, pectin) were utilized by a co-culture of five bacterial species (,  subspecies , , , ).

Use of systems like this might be used to predict changes to the emergent properties of the gut ecosystem when diet is altered, with the aim of beneficially affecting human physiology. This study addresses the question as to how bacterial species, characteristic of the human gut microbiota, collectively utilize mixtures of plant polysaccharides such as are found in dietary fiber. Five bacterial species with the capacity to degrade polymers and/or produce acidic fermentation products detectable in human feces were used in the experiments. The bacteria showed preferential use of certain polysaccharides over others for growth, and this influenced their fermentation output qualitatively. These kinds of studies are essential in developing concepts of how the gut microbial community shares habitat resources, directly and indirectly, when presented with mixtures of polysaccharides that are found in human diets. The concepts are required in planning dietary interventions that might correct imbalances in the functioning of the human microbiota so as to support measures to reduce metabolic conditions such as .Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559829>Gut microbiota regulates cardiac ischemic tolerance and aortic stiffness in .</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota has emerged as an important regulator of host physiology, with recent data suggesting a role in modulating cardiovascular health. The present study determined if gut microbial signatures could transfer cardiovascular risk phenotypes between lean and obese mice using cecal microbiota transplantation (CMT). Pooled cecal contents collected from obese leptin-deficient (Ob) mice or C57Bl/6j control (Con) mice were transplanted by oral gavage into cohorts of recipient Ob and Con mice maintained on identical low-fat diets for 8 weeks (n=9-11/group). Cardiovascular pathology was assessed as the degree of arterial stiffness (aortic pulse wave velocity) and myocardial infarct size following a 45/120 min  global cardiac ischemia/reperfusion protocol. Gut microbiota was characterized by 16s rDNA sequencing, along with measures of intestinal barrier function and cecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA) composition. Following CMT, the gut microbiota of recipient mice was altered to resemble that of the donors. Ob CMT to Con mice increased arterial stiffness, left ventricular (LV) mass and myocardial infarct size, which was associated with greater gut permeability and reduced cecal SCFA concentrations. Conversely, Con CMT to Ob mice increased cecal SCFA, reduced LV mass and attenuated myocardial infarct size, with no effects on gut permeability or arterial stiffness. Collectively, these data demonstrate that -related changes in the gut microbiota, independent of dietary manipulation, regulate hallmark measures of cardiovascular pathology in mice, and highlight the potential of microbiota-targeted therapeutics for reducing cardiovascular pathology and risk in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565875>Recent Progress on Branched-Chain Amino  in , Diabetes, and Beyond.</a></h2><p>Branched-chain amino  (BCAAs) are essential amino  that are not synthesized in our body; thus, they need to be obtained from food.

The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of using glutamate level to identify individuals with abdominal  and a high cardiometabolic risk.The study sample included 99 men and 99 women. Fasting serum glutamate was measured using the Biocrates p180 kit. Anthropometric and metabolic variables were used to identify individuals with abdominal  (WC ≥ 95 cm in both sexes), the hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTW) phenotype and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Mean (±SD) age was 34.1 ± 10.1 years, mean BMI was 29.0 ± 6.2 kg/m and mean WC was 92.7 ± 16.5 cm. Glutamate was strongly correlated with WC (r = 0.66 for men; r = 0.76 for women, both p < 0.0001) and multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction, particularly fasting triglyceride level (r = 0.59 for men; r = 0.57 for women, both p < 0.0001), HDL-cholesterol level (r = -0.45, p < 0.0001 in both sexes) and the HOMA-IR index (r = 0.65 for men; r = 0.60 for women, both p < 0.0001). Logistic regressions showed that glutamate had an excellent accuracy to identify individuals with abdominal  (ROC_AUC: 0.90 for both sexes), a good accuracy to identify those with the HTW phenotype (ROC_AUC: 0.82 for men; 0.85 for women) and fair-to-good accuracy for the MetS (ROC_AUC: 0.78 for men; 0.89 for women).Glutamate level may represent an interesting potential biomarker of abdominal  and metabolic risk.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

However, it is still deficient in clinical evidence for polyglycolic  sutures, a novel biodegradable material instead of catgut, embedded for the treatment of simple . In our study, we investigate the efficacy and related mechanism of polyglycolic  sutures embedded in abdominal acupoints on simple obese persons by a randomized control trial.A total of 51 eligible participators were randomly allocated to a polyglycolic  sutures embedding therapy (PASET) group (n = 28) or control group (n = 23). Participators in PASET group received polyglycolic  sutures alternatively embedded in abdominal I group and II group acupoints in odd and even number therapeutic courses, and participators in control group were required to perform lifestyle modification. The duration of the study was 10 weeks.It suggested that PASET significantly reduced weight, body mass index, hip circumference, waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio and thickness of abdominal subcutaneous fat tissue compared with those before treatment (p < 0.01), but lifestyle modification only illustrated downward trend of weight (p < 0.05).

These pathological conditions make mitochondria of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate mitochondria function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal  and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet. Mitochondria from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control mitochondria (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± 5.9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney mitochondria was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF mitochondria due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty  which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605240>Elevated serum ceramides are linked with -associated gut dysbiosis and impaired glucose metabolism.</a></h2><p>Low gut microbiome richness is associated with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, and ceramides and other sphingolipids are implicated in the development of diabetes.Determine whether circulating sphingolipids, particularly ceramides, are associated with alterations in the gut microbiome among obese patients with increased diabetes risk.This was a cross-sectional and longitudinal retrospective analysis of a dietary/weight loss intervention. Fasted serum was collected from 49 participants (41 women) and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS to quantify 45 sphingolipids. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool was performed to profile the gut microbiome.Confirming the link to deteriorated glucose homeostasis, serum ceramides were positively correlated with fasting glucose, but inversely correlated with fasting and OGTT-derived measures of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. Significant associations with gut dysbiosis were demonstrated, with SM and ceramides being inversely correlated with gene richness. Ceramides with fatty  chain lengths of 20-24 carbons were the most associated with low richness. Diet-induced weight loss, which improved gene richness, decreased most sphingolipids. Thirty-one MGS, mostly corresponding to unidentified bacteria species, were inversely correlated with ceramides, including a number of Bifidobacterium and Methanobrevibacter smithii. Higher ceramide levels were also associated with increased metagenomic modules for lipopolysaccharide synthesis and flagellan synthesis, two pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and decreased enrichment of genes involved in methanogenesis and bile  metabolism.This study identifies an association between gut microbiota richness, ceramides, and diabetes risk in overweight/obese humans, and suggests that the gut microbiota may contribute to dysregulation of lipid metabolism in metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668723>Dietary n-6 to n-3 fatty  ratio is related to liver fat content independent of genetic effects: Evidence from the monozygotic co-twin control design.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle changes focusing on diet and exercise remain the cornerstone of the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Although surgical and non-surgical methods for reducing SAT exist, patients remain non-compliant because of potential adverse effects and cost. In this study, we developed a new minimally-invasive approach to achieve SAT reduction, using a microneedle (MN) patch prepared from gelatin, which is capable of regulating fat metabolism. Four gelatin types were used: three derived from fish (SA-FG, GT-FG 220, and GT-FG 250), and one from swine (SM-PG 280). We applied gelatin-based MN patches five times over 4 weeks to rats with high-fat diet (HD)-induced , and determined the resulting amount of SAT. We also investigated the histological features and determined the expression levels of fat metabolism-associated genes in SAT using hematoxylin and eosin staining and western blotting, respectively. SAT decreased following treatment with all four gelatin MN patches. Smaller adipocytes were observed in the regions treated with SA-FG, GT-FG 250, and SM-PG 280 MNs, demonstrating a decline in fat accumulation. The expression levels of fat metabolism-associated genes in the MN-treated SAT revealed that GT-FG 220 regulates fatty  synthase (FASN) protein levels. These findings suggest that gelatin MN patches aid in decreasing the quantity of unwanted SAT by altering lipid metabolism and fat deposition.Copyright © 2019 The Korean Society Of Toxicology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678479>Fatty  synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 are conserved druggable cofactors of Old World Alphavirus genome replication.</a></h2><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a rapidly emerging mosquito-borne RNA virus that causes epidemics of debilitating disease in tropical and sub-tropical regions with autochtonous transmission in regions with temperate climate. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral drug available against CHIKV infection.

We show that both enzymes and their upstream regulator PI3K are required for optimal CHIKV infection. We demonstrate that pharmacologic manipulation of FASN or SCD1 enzymatic activity by non-toxic concentrations of cerulenin or CAY10566 decreases CHIKV genome replication. Interestingly, a similar inhibitory effect was also obtained with Orlistat, an FDA-approved anti- drug that targets FASN activity.

The purpose of this study was to identify the association between sedentary behavior and physical activity levels in South Korean men and women diagnosed with hyperuricemia.This study included 161,064 healthy men and women participants who had obtained a complete health examination. Physical activity levels and sitting time were assessed by the validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form Korean version. The presence of hyperuricemia in the subjects was determined by measuring serum uric  (SUA) concentration (SUA ≥6 mg/dL [male], SUA ≥7 mg/dL [female]). Logistic regression analysis, adjusting other confounding factors, was conducted to identify the association of sedentary behavior and physical activity levels with hyperuricemia (<0.05).Subjects who spent ≥10 hr/day in sedentary behavior were more likely to have hyperuricemia than those who spent <5 hour/day in sedentary behavior (OR=1.08, 95% CI=1.03-1.12). The subject group that more frequently participated in health enhanced physical activity (HEPA) had a lower hyperuricemia odds ratio than the subject group with lower physical activity participation rate (OR=0.90, 95% Ci=0.86-0.93). From the analysis of sex (male, female), age (young, middle, older), methods of measuring  (body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage), the association of sedentary behavior and physical activity levels with hyperuricemia was shown differently in different multivariable models.Participation in regular physical activity and reduced sedentary time is highly recommended in order to reduce the prevalence of hyperuricemia.© 2019 Park et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614951>Green Tea Polyphenol (-)-Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG) Attenuates Neuroinflammation in Palmitic -Stimulated BV-2 Microglia and High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p> is closely associated with neuroinflammation in the hypothalamus, which is characterized by over-activated microglia and excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

However, existing methods of assessing dietary intake in nutritional epidemiology rely on food frequency questionnaires or dietary records that are prone to bias and selective reporting. Herein, metabolic phenotyping was performed on 42 healthy participants from the Diet and Gene Intervention (DIGEST) pilot study, a parallel two-arm randomized clinical trial that provided complete diets to all participants. Matching single-spot urine and fasting plasma specimens were collected at baseline, and then following two weeks of either a Prudent or Western diet with a weight-maintaining menu plan designed by a dietician. Targeted and nontargeted metabolite profiling was conducted using three complementary analytical platforms, where 80 plasma metabolites and 84 creatinine-normalized urinary metabolites were reliably measured (CV < 30%) in the majority of participants (>75%) after implementing a rigorous data workflow for metabolite authentication with stringent quality control. We classified a panel of metabolites with distinctive trajectories following two weeks of food provisions when using complementary univariate and multivariate statistical models. Unknown metabolites associated with contrasting dietary patterns were identified with high-resolution MS/MS, as well as co-elution after spiking with authentic standards if available. Overall, 3-methylhistidine and proline betaine concentrations increased in both plasma and urine samples after participants were assigned a Prudent diet ( < 0.05) with a corresponding decrease in the Western diet group. Similarly, creatinine-normalized urinary imidazole propionate, hydroxypipecolic , dihydroxybenzoic , and enterolactone glucuronide, as well as plasma ketoleucine and ketovaline increased with a Prudent diet ( < 0.05) after adjustments for age, sex, and BMI. In contrast, plasma myristic , linoelaidic , linoleic , α-linoleic , pentadecanoic , alanine, proline, carnitine, and deoxycarnitine, as well as urinary acesulfame K increased among participants following a Western diet. Most metabolites were also correlated ( > ± 0.30,  < 0.05) to changes in the average intake of specific nutrients from self-reported diet records reflecting good adherence to assigned food provisions. Our study revealed robust biomarkers sensitive to short-term changes in habitual diet, which is needed for accurate monitoring of healthy eating patterns in free-living populations, and evidence-based public health policies for chronic disease prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678069>Ingestion of lean meat elevates muscle inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 protein content independent of a distinct post-prandial circulating proteome in young adults with .</a></h2><p>We have recently shown that a novel signalling kinase, inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1), is implicated in whole-body insulin resistance via its inhibitory action on Akt. Insulin and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) share many intracellular processes with both known to play a key role in glucose and protein metabolism in skeletal muscle.We aimed to compare IGF/IP6K1/Akt signalling and the plasma proteomic signature in individuals with a range of BMIs after ingestion of lean meat.Ten lean [Body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m): 22.7 ± 0.4; Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA): 1.36 ± 0.17], 10 overweight (BMI: 27.1 ± 0.5; HOMA: 1.25 ± 0.11), and 10 obese (BMI: 35.9 ± 1.3; HOMA: 5.82 ± 0.81) adults received primed continuous L-[ring-C]phenylalanine infusions. Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected at 0 min (post-absorptive), 120 min and 300 min relative to the ingestion of 170 g pork loin (36 g protein and 5 g fat) to examine skeletal muscle protein signalling, plasma proteomic signatures, and whole-body phenylalanine disappearance rates (R).Phenylalanine R was not different in obese compared to lean individuals at all time points and was not responsive to a pork ingestion (basal, P = .056; 120 & 300 min, P > .05). IP6K1 was elevated in obese individuals at 120 min post-prandial vs basal (P < .05). There were no acute differences plasma proteomic profiles between groups in the post-prandial state (P > .05).These data demonstrate, for the first time that muscle IP6K1 protein content is elevated after lean meat ingestion in obese adults, suggesting that IP6K1 may be contributing to the dysregulation of nutrient uptake in skeletal muscle. In addition, proteomic analysis showed no differences in proteomic signatures between obese, overweight or lean individuals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Treatment of these diseases has become increasingly challenging and expensive. The most effective and durable treatment for Class III  (body mass index ≥35 kg/m) is bariatric surgery, namely, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy. These procedures are associated with increased circulating bile , molecules that not only facilitate intestinal fat absorption but are also potent hormones regulating numerous metabolic pathways. We recently reported on a novel surgical procedure in mice, termed distal gallbladder bile diversion to the ileum (GB-IL), that emulates the altered bile flow after RYGB without other manipulations of gastrointestinal anatomy. GB-IL improves oral glucose tolerance in mice made obese with high-fat diet. This is accompanied by fat malabsorption and weight loss, which complicates studying the role of elevated circulating bile  in metabolic control. A less aggressive surgery in which the gallbladder bile is diverted to the proximal ileum, termed GB-IL, also improves glucose control but is not accompanied by fat malabsorption. To better understand the differential effects achieved by these bile diversion procedures, an untargeted ultraperformance liquid chromatography-ion mobility-mass spectrometry (UPLC-IM-MS) method was optimized for fecal samples derived from mice that have undergone bile diversion surgery. Utilizing the UPLC-IM-MS method, we were able to identify dysregulation of bile , short-chain fatty , and cholesterol derivatives that contribute to the differential metabolism resulting from these surgeries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607681>Mice lacking DGKε show increased beige adipogenesis in visceral white adipose tissue after long-term high fat diet in a COX-2- dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue is a central site for energy storage in the form of triglyceride (TG). Under excess energy conditions, TG is synthesized by acylation of diacylglycerol (DG), whereas TG is broken down into DG and free fatty , which provide energy for mitochondrial lipid oxidation when needed. In this regard, DG is not merely an intermediate metabolite for TG metabolism; it also serves as a signaling molecule. DG kinase (DGK) phosphorylates DG to produce phosphatidic  (PA). Consequently, DGK plays a pivotal role in the control of lipid metabolism and signal transduction pathway. Recently, a report has described that DGKε-knockout (KO) mice show expansion of epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) together with the impairment of glucose clearance after short-term (40 days) high fat diet (HFD) feeding, an early presymptomatic phase of  in wild-type animals. Nevertheless, no report describes an investigation of their phenotype under long-term HFD feeding conditions. Remarkably, results obtained during long-term HFD feeding show that WAT mass is decreased significantly and that the blood glucose profile in response to glucose challenge is improved in DGKε-KO mice compared with wild-type, which contrast sharply against the phenotype shown for short-term HFD feeding. Morphological examination reveals that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and clusters of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-positive multilocular brown-like ("beige") adipocyte are induced in DGKε-deficient WAT after long-term HFD feeding, suggesting that beige adipocytes facilitate energy expenditure during prolonged HFD feeding. Administration of celecoxib, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, abolishes the appearance of UCP1-positive beige adipocytes in DGKε-KO mice. These findings suggest that DGKε deficiency promotes visceral WAT remodeling in a COX-2-dependent manner under long-term HFD feeding conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Acquisition of brown-like features (browning) in perivascular white adipose tissue (PVAT) may protect against /cardiovascular disease. Most browning studies are performed in rodents, but translation to humans would benefit from a closer animal model. Therefore, we studied the browning response of ferret thoracic aortic PVAT (tPVAT) to cold. We performed global transcriptome analysis of tPVAT of 3-month-old ferrets acclimatized 1 week to 22 or 4°C, and compared the results with those of inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize browning. Transcriptome data revealed a stronger cold exposure response of tPVAT, including increased expression of key brown/brite markers, compared to subcutaneous fat. This translated into a clear white-to-brown remodeling of tPVAT, with the appearance of multilocular highly UCP1-stained adipocytes. The pathway most affected by cold exposure in tPVAT was immune response, characterized by down-regulation of immune-related genes, with cardio protective implications. On the other hand, subcutaneous fat responded to cold by increasing energy metabolism based on increased expression of fatty  oxidation and tricarboxylic  cycle genes, concordant with lower inguinal adipose tissue weight in cold-exposed animals. Thus, ferret tPVAT responds to cold acclimation with a strong induction of browning and immunosuppression compared to subcutaneous fat. Our results present ferrets as an accessible translational animal model displaying functional responses relevant for  and cardiovascular disease prevention.Copyright © 2019 Reynés, van Schothorst, Keijer, Ceresi, Oliver and Palou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554932>The regulation of hepatic fatty  synthesis and partitioning: the effect of nutritional state.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasing global public health burden. NAFLD is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus,  and cardiovascular disease and begins with intrahepatic triacylglycerol accumulation. Under healthy conditions, the liver regulates lipid metabolism to meet systemic energy needs in the fed and fasted states. The processes of fatty  uptake, fatty  synthesis and the intracellular partitioning of fatty  into storage, oxidation and secretion pathways are tightly regulated. When one or more of these processes becomes dysregulated, excess lipid accumulation can occur. Although genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the development of NAFLD, it remains unclear why an imbalance in these pathways begins. The regulation of fatty  partitioning occurs at several points, including during triacylglycerol synthesis, lipid droplet formation and lipolysis. These processes are influenced by enzyme function, intake of dietary fats and sugars and whole-body metabolism, and are further affected by the presence of  or insulin resistance. Insight into how the liver controls fatty  metabolism in health and how these processes might be affected in disease would offer the potential for new therapeutic treatments for NAFLD to be developed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553330>Characteristics of amino  profile and incretin hormones in patients with gallstone disease - a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Gallstone disease is associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and increased risk of incident ischemic heart disease. It is known that branched-chain amino  (BCAAs) profile is altered in cardiac diseases and in metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, . The role of BCAAs in gallstone disease is still not known.The aim of this study was to evaluate the concentration of essential amino  and incretin hormones in patients with cholecystolithiasis.The study included 31 patients with cholecystolithiasis and 25 gallstone-free controls. Free exogenous and endogenous amino , bile , glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), ghrelin, C-peptide and insulin were measured in the fasting state and one hour after consumption of a 300-kcal mixed meal.The mean fasting and postprandial levels of BCAAs: valine, isoleucine, leucine and lysine were significantly higher in the study group than in the controls (p=0.005 - <0.001). The percentage increase in concentrations of amino  after a meal were similar in both groups of patients. The mean fasting concentrations of C-peptide and GLP-1 were higher in the study group than in the control group (p=0.004 and p=0.03, respectively), and the median postprandial concentration of C-peptide was higher in the study group as compared to the control group (p=0.03).Diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease and gallstone disease might have common genetic and environmental antecedents.

NAFLD is characterized by hepatic steatosis and may progress to an inflammatory condition termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It became evident in the last years that NAFLD pathophysiology is complex and involves diverse immunological and metabolic pathways. An association between intestinal signals (e.g., derived from the gut microbiota) and the development of  and its metabolic consequences such as NAFLD are increasingly recognized. Pre-clinical studies have shown that germ-free mice are protected against  and hepatic steatosis. Several human studies from the past years have demonstrated that NAFLD contains a disease-specific gut microbiome signature. Controlled studies propose that certain bacteria with rather pro-inflammatory features such as Proteobacteria or  are dominantly present in these patients. In contrast, rather protective bacteria such as  are decreased in NAFLD patients. Furthermore, various bacterial metabolites and microbiota-generated secondary bile  are involved in NAFLD-associated metabolic dysfunction. Although these findings are exciting, research currently lack evidence that interference at the level of the gut microbiome is beneficial for these diseases. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to advance this aspect of NAFLD research and to support the notion that the intestinal microbiota is indeed of major relevance in this disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652531>The Role of Glutamine in the Complex Interaction between Gut Microbiota and Health: A Narrative Review.</a></h2><p>The scientific literature has demonstrated that glutamine is one of the main beneficial amino .

As a result of this review, we have summarized that glutamine could affect gut microbiota via different mechanisms including the reduction in the ratio of  to  with the activation of NF-κB and PI3K-Akt pathways, reducing the intestinal colonization ( lesions) and bacterial overgrowth or bacterial translocation, increasing the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and immunoglobulin A+ (IgA) cells in the intestinal lumen, and decreasing asparagine levels. The potential applications of glutamine on gut microbiota include, but are not limited to, the management of , bacterial translocation and community, cytokines profiles, and the management of side effects during post-chemotherapy and constipation periods.

To identify new genes involved in central liver functions, we examined liver RNA-sequence data from 259 patients who underwent morbidly obese bariatric surgery. Of these patients, 84 had normal liver histology, 40 simple steatosis, 43 nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and the remaining 92 patients had varying degrees of NAFLD based on liver histology. We discovered oligodendrocyte maturation-associated long intergenic noncoding RNA () a long intervening noncoding RNA (lincRNA) in a human liver co-expression network (n = 75 genes) that was strongly associated with statin use and serum triglycerides (TGs).  liver expression was highly correlated with the expression of known cholesterol biosynthesis genes and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase ().  is the rate-limiting enzyme in monounsaturated fatty  and a key TG gene that is known to be up-regulated in liver steatosis and NAFLD and resides adjacent to  on the human chromosome 10q24.31.

We aimed to validate existing and identify novel metabolic biomarkers predictive of future diabetes in large cohorts of young adults.NMR metabolomics was used to quantify 229 circulating metabolic measures in 11,896 individuals from four Finnish observational cohorts (baseline age 24-45 years). Associations between baseline metabolites and risk of developing diabetes during 8-15 years of follow-up (392 incident cases) were adjusted for sex, age, BMI and fasting glucose. Prospective metabolite associations were also tested with fasting glucose, 2 h glucose and HOMA-IR at follow-up.Out of 229 metabolic measures, 113 were associated with incident type 2 diabetes in meta-analysis of the four cohorts (ORs per 1 SD: 0.59-1.50; p< 0.0009). Among the strongest biomarkers of diabetes risk were branched-chain and aromatic amino  (OR 1.31-1.33) and triacylglycerol within VLDL particles (OR 1.33-1.50), as well as linoleic n-6 fatty  (OR 0.75) and non-esterified cholesterol in large HDL particles (OR 0.59). The metabolic biomarkers were more strongly associated with deterioration in post-load glucose and insulin resistance than with future fasting hyperglycaemia. A multi-metabolite score comprised of phenylalanine, non-esterified cholesterol in large HDL and the ratio of cholesteryl ester to total lipid in large VLDL was associated with future diabetes risk (OR 10.1 comparing individuals in upper vs lower fifth of the multi-metabolite score) in one of the cohorts (mean age 31 years).Metabolic biomarkers across multiple molecular pathways are already predictive of the long-term risk of diabetes in young adults.

As a functional group for targeted drug delivery, boronic  (BAs) have been incorporated in polymeric particles both as a stimuli-responsive functional group and as a targeting ligand. Here, BA chemistry presents a wealth of opportunities for biological applications. It not only reacts with several chemical markers of disease such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glucose, and reduced pH, but it also acts as ligands for diols such as sialic . These stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems optimize delivery of therapeutics based on rational design and precise molecular engineering. When designing materials containing BA, the unique chemical properties are important to take into consideration such as its vacant p-orbital, its molecular geometry, and the designed 's p. Instead of behaving as most carboxylic  that donate protons, BAs instead primarily act as Lewis  that accept electrons. In aqueous solution, most polymers containing BA exist in an equilibrium between their triangular hydrophobic form and a tetrahedral hydrophilic form. The most common p's are in the nonphysiological range of 8-10, and much ongoing research focuses on modifying BAs into materials sensitive to a more physiologically relevant pH range. So far, BA moieties have been incorporated into a stunning array of materials, ranging from small molecules that can self-assemble into higher order structures such as micelles and polymeric micelles, via larger polymeric assemblies, to large scale hydrogels. With the abundance of biological molecules containing diols and polyhydroxy motifs, BA-containing materials have proven valuable in several biomedical applications such as treatment of cancer, diabetes, , and bacterial infections. Both materials functionalized with BA and boronic esters display good safety profiles in vitro and in vivo; thus, BA-containing materials represent promising carriers for responsive delivery systems with great potential for clinical translation. The intention of this Account is to showcase the versatility of BA for biomedical applications. We first discuss the chemistry of BA and what to consider when designing BA-containing materials. Further, we review how its chemistry recently has been applied to nanomaterials for enhanced delivery efficiency, both as a stimuli-responsive group and as a targeting ligand. Lastly, we discuss the current limitations and further perspectives of BA in biomaterials, based on the great benefits that can come from utilizing the unique BA chemistry to enhance drug delivery efficiency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced metabolic distress and alters beneficially the gut microbiota in mice model.</a></h2><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying metabolic syndrome. Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut microbiota, have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic -Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti- property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly -associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress.

Further analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) revealed that Stk39 and Ass1 interacting through Mapk14-Ywhae were node proteins and participated in inflammatory response, carboxylic  metabolic process, and small molecule metabolic process. In vitro experiments we confirmed that silencing TLR4 can inhibit PA-induced β-cell apoptosis, insulin secretion disorders, and increase Ass1 expression.

Metabolic surgery is the most effective treatment for selected patients with diabetes and/or . When compared to intensive medical therapy and lifestyle intervention, metabolic surgery has shown superiority in achieving glycemic improvement, reducing number of medications and cardiovascular risk factors, which translates in long-term benefits on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying diabetes improvement after metabolic surgery have not yet been clearly understood but englobe a complex interaction among improvements in beta cell function and insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, intestinal gluconeogenesis, changes in glucose utilization, and absorption by the gut and changes in the secretory pattern and morphology of adipose tissue. These are achieved through different mediators which include an enhancement in gut hormones release, especially, glucagon-like peptide 1, changes in bile  circulation, gut microbiome, and glucose transporters expression. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive appraisal of what is known so far to better understand the mechanisms through which metabolic surgery improves glycemic control facilitating future research in the field.Copyright © 2019 Pérez-Pevida, Escalada, Miras and Frühbeck.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581129>Hyperinsulinemia: does it tip the balance toward intrahepatic fat accumulation?</a></h2><p>In health, the liver is metabolically flexible over the course of the day, as it undertakes a multitude of physiological processes including the regulation of intrahepatic and systemic glucose and lipid levels. The liver is the first organ to receive insulin and through a cascade of complex series of steps, insulin not only plays a key role in the intrahepatic regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism but also in the regulation of systemic glucose and lipid concentrations. Thus, when intra-hepatic insulin signalling becomes aberrant then this may lead to perturbations in intra-hepatic metabolic processes that have the potential to impact on metabolic health. For example,  is associated with intra-hepatic fat accumulation (known as non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD)) and hyperinsulinaemia, the latter as a result of insulin hypersecretion or impaired hepatic insulin extraction. Although insulin signalling directly alters intra- and extra-hepatic metabolism, the regulation of hepatic glucose and fatty  metabolism is also indirectly driven by substrate availability. Here we discuss the direct and indirect effects of insulin on intrahepatic processes such as the synthesis of fatty  and peripherally regulating the flux of fatty  to the liver; processes that may play a role in the development of insulin resistance and/or IHTAG accumulation in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622606>Oral gallic  improves metabolic profile by modulating SIRT1 expression in obese mice brown adipose tissue: A molecular and bioinformatic approach.</a></h2><p>The aim of the presente study was to examine the effects of oral gallic  (GA) administration on the brown adipose tissue of obese mice fed with high-fat diet. New mechanisms and interactions pathways in thermogenesis were accessed through bioinformatics analyses.Swiss male mice were divided into four groups and fed during 60 days with: standard diet, standard diet combined with gallic , high-fat diet and high-fat diet combined with gallic . Body weight, food intake, and blood parameters (glucose tolerance test, total-cholesterol, high-density low-c, triglyceride and glucose levels) were evaluated.

This report investigates some underlying mechanisms contributing to  during early life in an animal model. We generated a strain of transgenic mice, cU2, overexpressing human microRNA 34c, a microRNA functionally implicated in adipogenesis. Male and female cU2 mice exhibit significant weight gain, accompanied by marked increase in abdominal fat mass and metabolic abnormalities, including reduction of both glucose clearance rate and insulin sensitivity, as early as two months of age. Adipogenesis derailment at this early age is suggested by decreased expression of adiponectin, the fat mass and -associated gene, and the adiponectin receptor R1, coupled with a reduction of the brown fat biomarker PAT2 and the adipogenesis inhibitor SIRT1. Notably, adiponectin is an important adipokine and an essential regulator of glucose and fatty  homeostasis. cU2 mice may provide a crucial animal model for investigating the role of miR-34c in early onset insulin resistance and visceral fat mass increase, contributing to accelerated body weight gain and metabolic disorders. Intervention in this dysregulation may open a new preventive strategy to control early-life weight gain and abnormal insulin resistance, and thus prevalent adult and late life .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642669>Effects of rice with different amounts of resistant starch on mice fed a high-fat diet: attenuation of adipose weight gain.</a></h2><p>Increasing the amount of resistant starch (RS) in the diet may confer protective effects against chronic diseases. Rice, a good dietary source of carbohydrates, also contains RS. However, it remains unclear if RS at the amount consumed in cooked rice has health benefit. To address the question, we examined the effects of cooked rice containing different levels of RS in a diet-induced  rodent model. Rice containing RS as low as 1.07% attenuated adipose weight and adipocyte size gain, induced by a moderately high-fat (HF) diet which correlated with lower leptin levels in plasma and adipose tissue. Rice with 8.61% RS increased fecal short chain fatty  (SCFA) levels, modulated HF diet-induced adipose triacylglycerol metabolism and inflammation related genes' expression, and increased fecal triglyceride excretion.

To identify a new link between adipocyte and insulin resistance, we performed targeted metabolite profiling of differentiated adipocytes and studied the association between adipogenic metabolites and insulin resistance. We found a correlation between 2-aminoadipic  (2-AAA) and adipogenic differentiation. Also, circulatory 2-AAA was positively associated with -related factors (fat mass, fat percent, waist circumference, BMI, BMI z-score, triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR) at baseline and after 2 years in the children cohort study. Of these factors, increased BMI z-score and HOMA-IR were the primary independent factors associated with higher 2-AAA levels, and the baseline 2-AAA level was an indicator of the BMI z-score after 2 years. To validate the relationship between 2-AAA and -related factors, we analyzed changes in 2-AAA levels following  intervention programs in two independent studies. In both studies, changes in 2-AAA levels during the intervention period were positively correlated with changes in the BMI z-score and HOMA-IR after adjusting for confounders. Moreover, the 2-AAA levels were increased in cell and mouse models of -related insulin resistance. Excess 2-AAA levels led to impaired insulin signaling in insulin-sensitive cells (liver, skeletal muscle and adipose cells) and caused abnormal gluconeogenesis. Our results demonstrate that 2-AAA is associated with adipogenesis and insulin resistance. In this regard, 2-AAA could be a potential biomarker of  and -related metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547352>Dairy Fat Consumption and the Risk of Metabolic Syndrome: An Examination of the Saturated Fatty  in Dairy.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle is a key modifiable risk factor involved in the manifestation of metabolic syndrome and, in particular, diet plays a pivotal role in its prevention and development. Current dietary guidelines discourage the consumption of saturated fat and dietary sources rich in saturated fat, such as dairy products, despite data suggesting that full-fat dairy consumption is protective against metabolic syndrome. This narrative review assessed the recent epidemiological and clinical research that examined the consumption of dairy-derived saturated fatty  (SFA) on metabolic syndrome risk. In addition, this review evaluated studies of individual SFA to gain insight into the potential mechanisms at play with intake of a diet enriched with these dairy-derived fatty . This work underscores that SFA are a heterogenous class of fatty  that can differ considerably in their biological activity within the body depending on their length and specific chemical structure. In summary, previous work on the impact of dairy-derived SFA consumption on disease risk suggests that there is currently insufficient evidence to support current dietary guidelines which consolidate all dietary SFA into a single group of nutrients whose consumption should be reduced, regardless of dietary source, food matrix, and composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569521>Separation and Lipid Inhibition Effects of a Novel Decapeptide from .</a></h2><p>A novel lipid inhibition peptide Leu-Leu-Val-Val-Try-Pro-Trp-Thr-Gln-Arg (PP1) (MW 1274.53 Da) was obtained from  using enzymatic hydrolysis, gel filtration chromatography, and LC-MS/MS. Its lipid inhibition effects indicated that the synthetic peptide PP1 exhibits a good inhibitory effect against porcine pancreatic lipase (PL) (47.95%) at 200 μg/mL, which could be attributed to its hydrogen binding into catalytic sites of PL (Ser153, Asp177, and His 264) by docking analysis. Furthermore, in 3T3-L1 cells, the synthetic PP1 remarkedly decreased the accumulation of intracellular triacylglycerol (27.9%, 600 μg/mL), which carried a similar consequence as the positive drug simvastatin (24.1%, 10 μM). Western blot revealed that PP1 inhibited the lipid accumulation and fatty  synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in two pathways, primarily: nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathway (C/EBPα, SREBP-1c, AMPKα) and AMPK signaling pathway (SREBP-1c, PPARγ, AMPKα). In short, these results support that PP1 can be used as a potential agent against .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves lipid and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of lipid metabolism in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without diabetes. Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty , lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic  levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

However, the mechanism underlying this association remains poorly understood. In the present study, a gilt  model was developed by exposure to different energy diets and used to investigate the role of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) in the placenta. Specifically, 99 gilts (Guangdong Small-ear Spotted pig) at day 60 of gestation were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatments: low-energy group (L, DE = 11.50 MJ/kg), medium-energy group (M, DE = 12.41 MJ/kg), and high-energy group (H, DE = 13.42 MJ/kg), with 11 replicate pens per treatment and 3 gilts per pen. At the start of the study, maternal body weight and backfat thickness were not significantly different in the three treatments. After the study, data indicated that the H group had higher body weight and backfat thickness gain for gilts during gestation and lower piglet birth weight compared with the other two groups. Additionally, the H group showed glucolipid metabolic disorders and increased triglyceride and nonesterified fatty  contents in the placenta of gilts. Compared with the L group, the H group exhibited lower mitochondrial biogenesis and increased oxidative damage in the placenta. Importantly, increased mRNA expression and protein abundance of Nox2 were observed for the first time in H group placentae. Furthermore, compared with the L group, the H group showed a decrease in the density of placental vessels and the protein levels of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (p-VEGFR2) as well as the immunostaining intensity of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31). Our findings suggest that maternal high-energy diet-induced  increases placental oxidative stress and decreases placental angiogenesis possibly through the upregulation of Nox2.Copyright © 2019 Chengjun Hu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564549>PRDM16 Maintains Homeostasis of the Intestinal Epithelium by Controlling Region-Specific Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Metabolic pathways dynamically regulate tissue development and maintenance. However, the mechanisms that govern the metabolic adaptation of stem or progenitor cells to their local niche are poorly understood. Here, we define the transcription factor PRDM16 as a region-specific regulator of intestinal metabolism and epithelial renewal. PRDM16 is selectively expressed in the upper intestine, with enrichment in crypt-resident progenitor cells. Acute Prdm16 deletion in mice triggered progenitor apoptosis, leading to diminished epithelial differentiation and severe intestinal atrophy. Genomic and metabolic analyses showed that PRDM16 transcriptionally controls fatty  oxidation (FAO) in crypts. Expression of this PRDM16-driven FAO program was highest in the upper small intestine and declined distally. Accordingly, deletion of Prdm16 or inhibition of FAO selectively impaired the development and maintenance of upper intestinal enteroids, and these effects were rescued by acetate treatment. Collectively, these data reveal that regionally specified metabolic programs regulate intestinal maintenance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Our previous study demonstrated that several novel peptides derived from Corylus heterophylla Fisch (C. heterophylla Fisch) have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we purified and identified anti- peptides from hazelnut protein hydrolysates by chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Subsequently, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of the synthetic peptide on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by Oil Red O staining, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot. The results showed that a novel synthetic pentapeptide, Arg-Leu-Leu-Pro-His (RLLPH), derived from the C3 fraction, attenuated adipogenesis by downregulating the expression of several mRNAs related to adipogenesis, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), adipocyte fatty -binding protein 2 (aP2), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty  synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Moreover, RLLPH upregulated the levels of phosphorylated Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A stability study revealed that RLLPH was relatively stable during pepsin digestion. These findings suggest that RLLPH has potential anti- effects and may help combat metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, our aim was to conduct a review to investigate the possible effect and related mechanisms. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, and SCOPUS, to identify studies investigating -3 fatty  as a preventative or therapeutic agent for the attenuation of PCOS complications. Subsequently, the impact of omega-3 on PCOS, omega-3 and inflammation, omega-3 and insulin resistance, omega-3 and adipokines, omega-3 and lipid metabolism, omega-3 and endothelial function and omega-3 and hormonal factors were discussed. There are multiple mechanisms by which -3 PUFAs may exert their beneficial effects on PCOS, including anti-, glycemic and hormonal hemostasis, anti-inflammatory, regulation of adipokine production and enhancement of endothelial function -3 PUFAs are a promising agent in relieving complications associated with PCOS. Although most of the studies in patients with PCOS reported an improvement in most complications after administration of omega-3 supplements, there is a distinct dearth of studies investigating the dietary intake of these types of fatty . Moreover, favorable effects regarding the improvement of dyslipidemia, regulation of adipokines, regulation of hormonal factors and enhancement of endothelial function are limited. Therefore, more trials are warranted to investigate palatable mechanisms for clarifying the metabolic and hormonal effects of these agents in PCOS.Copyright © 2019 Salek et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618980> Extract Ameliorates High-Fat Diet-Induced  in C57BL/6N Mice by Upregulating SIRT1.</a></h2><p> is widely used in Asia as a herbal medicine to treat type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and inflammation. Here, we investigated the anti- effect and underlying mechanism of  extract (GPE) enriched in gypenoside L, gypenoside LI, and ginsenoside Rg3 and obtained using a novel extraction method. Five-week-old male C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet (CD), high-fat diet (HFD), HFD + 100 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day GPE (GPE 100), HFD + 300 mg/kg BW/day GPE (GPE 300), or HFD + 30 mg/kg BW/day Orlistat (Orlistat 30) for 8 weeks. The HFD-fed mice showed significant increases in body weight, fat mass, white adipose tissue, and adipocyte hypertrophy compared to the CD group; but GPE inhibited those increases. GPE reduced serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, without affecting HDL-cholesterol. GPE significantly increased AMPK activation and suppressed adipogenesis by decreasing the mRNA expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c), PPARγ coactivator-1α, fatty  synthase (FAS), adipocyte protein 2 (AP2), and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and by increasing that of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) and hormone- sensitive lipase (HSL).

The known active ingredients in T. wilfordii are mainly terpenoids,but with very low content. Therefore,the analysis of the biosynthesis pathway of terpenoids in T. wilfordii has become a research hotspot to solve the problem of its resources. Terpenoid synthase( TPS) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the formation of a wide variety of terpenoid skeletons. In this study,a gene fragment with an ORF of 1 785 bp was cloned from T. wilfordii. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using NCBI's BLASTP,ProtParam and Interpro online tools and MEGA 6.0 software. The response of this gene to methyl jasmonate was also detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR,and its catalytic function was verified by prokaryotic expression and in vitro enzymatic assay. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the amino  sequence encoded by this gene had both N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain of TPS,as well as the DDxx D conserved domain of the class I of TPS family. And Tw MTS gathered together with TPS-b subfamily in the Neighbor-Joining Tree constructed with known homologous TPSs. The results of RT-PCR showed that 50 μmol·L-1 MeJA 12 h could increase the expression of Tw MTS to 735 times in the control group at 12 h,and 1 644 times at 24 h. In addition,in vitro enzymatic reaction results showed that Tw MTS can catalyze the production of β-citronellol with GPP as substrate,indicating that Tw MTS was a monoterpene synthase. The above results provided a new element for the synthetic biology database of T. wilfordii terpenoids,and laid the foundation for future biosynthesis research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586321>Nutritional Models of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h2><p>In order to better understand the events that precede and precipitate the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), several nutritional animal models have been developed. These models are generated by manipulating the diet of either the animal itself, or its mother during her pregnancy, and in comparison to traditional genetic and knock out models, have the advantage that they more accurately reflect the etiology of human T2DM. This chapter will discuss some of the most widely used nutritional models of T2DM: Diet-induced  (DIO) in adult rodents, and studies of offspring of mothers fed a low-protein, high-fat and/or high-sugar diet during pregnancy and/or lactation. Several common mechanisms have been identified through which these nutritional manipulations can lead to metabolic disease, including pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, impaired insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, and the excess accumulation of visceral adipose tissue and consequent deposition of nonesterified fatty  in peripheral tissues. In addition, there is an emerging concept that /poor quality diets result in increased production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from adipose tissue leading to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, and that this is likely to represent an important link between /diet and metabolic dysfunction. The following chapter will discuss the most common nutritional models of T2DM in experimental animals, their application, and relationship to human etiology, and will highlight the important insights these models have provided into the pathogenesis of T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547031> Root Extract Inhibits Adipogenesis by Promoting Lipolysis in High Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p> (AH) is widely consumed as a herbal medicine. It possesses biological activity against metabolic diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of AH root water extract (AHR) on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. AHR inhibited lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation by downregulation of gene expression, such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and an adipogenic gene, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Oral administration of AHR significantly suppressed body weight gain, adipose tissue weight, serum leptin levels, and adipocyte cell size in HFD-induced obese mice. Moreover, AHR significantly decreased hepatic mRNA expression levels of cholesterol synthesis genes, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor (SREBP)-2, and low-density lipoprotein receptor, as well as fatty  synthesis genes, such as SREBP-1c and fatty  synthase. Serum triglyceride levels were also lowered by AHR, likely as a result of the upregulating gene involved in fatty  β-oxidation, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, in the liver. AHR treatment activated gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, which might have promoted HSL and LPL-medicated lipolysis, thereby reducing white adipose tissue weight. In conclusion, AHR treatment can improve metabolic alterations induced by HFD in mice by modifying expression levels of genes involved in adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipolysis in the white adipose tissue and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550559>Adipokines are associated with pediatric multiple sclerosis risk and course.</a></h2><p> during adolescence confers an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) in both adults and children. However, -mediated inflammatory mechanisms require elucidation. In models of MS, leptin and fatty  binding protein-4 (FABP-4) have been identified as proinflammatory adipokines, while adiponectin has anti-inflammatory effects.Morning serum samples from 32 pediatric MS (POMS) patients (22 females;10 males) and 67 pediatric healthy controls (PHC) (47 females; 20 males) followed at Massachusetts General Hospital were studied. Levels of leptin, FABP-4 and adiponectin were compared between POMS and PHC groups, adjusting for sex, age and vitamin D3 levels. Associations between each marker and the time to next relapse was assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. The association between each marker and EDSS was assessed using linear regression.Pediatric MS patients had significantly higher levels of leptin and FABP4 and significantly lower adiponectin than healthy controls. Higher levels of adiponectin were associated with a lower hazard of relapse. Similar differences were observed between POMS and PHC males for both leptin and adiponectin, and within females for FABP4. In females with MS, there was a trend for a positive association between higher leptin levels and higher disability scores. In males with MS, paradoxically, higher leptin levels were associated with longer time to next relapse. All these results remained significant after adjusting for Vitamin D.FABP4 and leptin levels are higher, while adiponectin levels are lower in pediatric MS compared to controls in sex-specific patterns. These adipokines could serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets of disease risk and course in early forms of MS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
