Violence against Indigenous women in Canada has been widely publicized but has not informed the planning of housing interventions. Despite historical policies leading to disenfranchisement of Indigenous rights in gender-specific ways, little is known about contemporary differences in need between homeless Indigenous men and women. This study investigated mental health, substance use and service use among Indigenous people who met criteria for homelessness and mental illness, and hypothesized that, compared to men, women would have significantly higher rates of trauma, suicidality, substance dependence, and experiences of violence.This study was conducted using baseline (pre-randomization) data from a multi-site trial. Inclusion in the current analyses was restricted to participants who self-reported Indigenous ethnicity, and combined eligible participants from Vancouver, BC and Winnipeg, MB. Logistic regression analyses were used to model the independent associations between gender and outcome variables.In multivariable regression models among Indigenous participants (n = 439), female gender was predictive of meeting criteria for PTSD, multiple mental disorders, current high suicidality and current substance dependence. Female gender was also significantly associated with reported physical (AOR: 1.52, 95% CI = 1.10-.23) and sexual (AOR: 6.31, 95% CI = .78-14.31) violence.Our analyses of Indigenous men and women who are homeless illustrate the distinct legacy of  on the experiences of Indigenous women. Our findings are consistent with the widely documented violence against Indigenous women in Canada. Housing policies and services are urgently needed that take Indigenous historical contexts, trauma and gender into account.This trial has been registered with the International Standard Randomized Control Trial Number Register and assigned ISRCTN42520374 ; ISRCTN57595077 ; ISRCTN66721740 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671720>The Human Milk Microbiota is Modulated by Maternal Diet.</a></h2><p>Human milk microorganisms contribute not only to the healthy development of the immune system in infants, but also in shaping the gut microbiota. We evaluated the effect of the maternal diet during pregnancy and during the first month of lactation on the human milk microbiota in a cross-sectional study including 94 healthy lactating women. Microbiota composition was determined by 16S rDNA profiling and nutrient intake assessed through food questionnaires. Thirteen genera were present in at least 90% of all samples, with three genera present in all samples: , , and . Cluster analysis indicated two distinct compositions: one marked by a high abundance of  (cluster 1), and other by a high abundance of  (cluster ). A global association with milk microbiota diversity was observed for vitamin C intake during pregnancy ( = 0.029), which was higher for cluster  individuals (cluster  median = 232 mg/d; cluster 1 = 175 mg/d;  = 0.02). Positive correlations were found between  in the milk and intake of polyunsaturated and linoleic fatty acids during the lactation period ( < 0.01). We show that maternal diet influences the human milk microbiota, especially during pregnancy, which may contribute in shaping the gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580985>Molecular Subtyping of Blastocystis from Diverse Animals in the United Arab Emirates.</a></h2><p>The contribution of Blastocystis from non-human hosts to zoonotic transmission is only partly known. The objective of this study was to determine the distribution of Blastocystis genetic subtypes in different animal species in United Arab Emirates. A total of 114 stool samples were tested using PCR of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene and sequence analysis. Twenty-three Blastocystis-positive samples were identified. The following detection rates were observed: cattle, 22.7%; sheep, 63.6%; rabbits, 33.3%; rodents, 37.5%; reptiles, 21.%. Four subtypes were identified in this study; ST4, ST10, ST14, and ST17; ST10 was isolated from sheep and cattle, corroborating previous data indicating that these are natural hosts for this subtype. Cases of mixed subtype  were also detected. Conspicuously, we found ST14 in rabbits. The discovery of ST17 in a squirrel indicates a novel host for this subtype. Furthermore, the discovery of ST4 in rodents suggests that these may serve as reservoir for human Blastocystis ST4 . Six tortoises and one iguana were positive for Blastocystis. In conclusion, this is the first report of Blastocystis infection in various animals in the UAE. Apart from ST4, no potentially zoonotic subtypes were detected.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

This prospective observational study investigated bacterial airway , and whether its detection and quantification in the endotracheal aspirate (ETA) is useful for identifying mechanically ventilated ICU patients who are at risk of developing VAP.240 patients admitted to 3 ICUs at the Lahey Hospital and Medical Center (Burlington, MA) between June 2014 and June 2015 and mechanically ventilated for >  days were included. ETA samples and clinical data were collected. Airway  was assessed, and subsequently categorized into "heavy" and "light" by semi-quantitative microbiological analysis of ETAs. VAP was diagnosed retrospectively by the study sponsor according to a pre-specified pneumonia definition.Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from ETAs of 125 patients. The most common species isolated was S. aureus (56.8%), followed by K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli (35.% combined). VAP was diagnosed in 85 patients, 44 (51.7%) with no bacterial pathogen, 18 associated with S. aureus and 18 Gram-negative-only cases, and 5 associated with other Gram-positive or mixed species. A higher proportion of patients who were heavily colonized with S. aureus developed VAP (32.4%) associated with S. aureus compared to those lightly colonized (17.6%). The same tendency was seen for patients heavily and lightly colonized with Gram-negative pathogens (30.0 and 0.0%, respectively). Detection of S. aureus in the ETA preceded S. aureus VAP by approximately 4 days, while Gram-negative organisms were first detected .5 days prior to Gram-negative VAP. VAP was associated with significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization regardless of microbiologic cause when compared to patients who did not develop VAP.The overall VAP rate was 35%. Heavy tracheal  supported identification of patients at higher risk of developing a corresponding S. aureus or Gram-negative VAP. Detection of bacterial ETA-positivity tended to precede VAP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555982>ECM-Mimetic Multiresponsive Nanobullets Targeted Against Metastasizing Circulating Tumor Clusters in Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>Targeting smaller populations of circulating tumor clusters (CTC) with tumor-initiating and  potentials at distant sites in circulation remains a challenge as clusters possess both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics. Bullet shaped ellipsoidal nanostructures of size 600 ± 11.3 nm (major axis) and 281.9 ± 5.3 nm (minor axis) with . aspect ratio were self-assembled using inorganic and organic GRAS biomaterials to preferentially target tumor-causing CTCs. Negatively-charged chondroitin sulfate in presence of gelatin guides unidirectional growth of calcium carbonate mesocrystals to form nanobullets, mediates CD44 targeting of CTCs. Switchable multi-responsive drug release profiles (temperature and pH) were recorded for nanobullets promoting spontaneous and efficient cell-killing. CD44 and E-cadherin overexpressing 'seeding' cell clusters of 170 ± 22 µm were developed as in vitro CTC model. pH responsive release of Dox into lysosome stimulates calcium influx resulting in cell death. CD44-blocked CTCs showed significantly reduced internalization when compared to CD44-expressing CTCs thereby confirming CD44 specific internalization of nanobullets. Significantly retarded expansion of clusters when shifted to cell adhesive surfaces depicts the potential of nanobullets against  of CTCs. Hence, newer insights on developed anisotropic ECM-mimetic nanohybrids would enhance targeted capture of tumor-initiating clusters in systemic circulation that would potentially reduce the progression of tumor in breast cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474964>Legitimate and Reliable Determination of the Age-Related Intestinal Microbiome in Young Piglets; Rectal Swabs and Fecal Samples Provide Comparable Insights.</a></h2><p>A prerequisite for reliable microbiota analysis is having an effective and consistent sampling method. Fecal sampling, commonly used to study the intestinal microbiome, might not be suitable in all situations, especially considering the potential difficulties in obtaining fresh feces from young animals. Indeed, this study shows that the success rate of collecting fecal samples from young piglets (< weeks of age) was very low. Therefore, we evaluated rectal swabs as an alternative sample type (to feces) for studying porcine microbiome development and performed a comparative analysis of microbiome composition obtained from fresh fecal samples and rectal swabs in 15 healthy piglets at seven (6 piglets) and 20 (9 piglets) days of age. Three samples (fresh feces, rectal swab before and after defecation) were collected from individual piglets and microbiome composition was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results demonstrated that rectal swabs and fecal samples provide similar microbiome composition profiles, with samples clustering predominantly by individual animal rather than sample type. Furthermore, regardless of the sample type, the biological interpretation with respect to microbiota  patterns associated with different ages (7 and 20 days) was found to be comparable. Independent of sample type, we observed age-related changes like increasing microbiota diversity and alterations in relative abundances of the phyla  and , which was also reflected in consistent family- and genus-level microbiota changes. This study establishes that rectal swabs are a suitable alternative sample type to study the porcine microbiome development in early life, when fecal sampling is challenging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613012>Understanding interaction effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in rice under elevated carbon dioxide conditions.</a></h2><p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), particularly the Glomerales group, play a paramount role in plant nutrient uptake, and abiotic and biotic stress management in rice, but recent evidence revealed that elevated CO concentration considerably reduces the Glomerales group in soil. In view of this, the present study was initiated to understand the interaction effect of native Glomerales species application in rice plants (cv. Naveen) under elevated CO concentrations (400 ± 10, 550 ± 20, and 700 ± 20 ppm) in open-top chambers. Three different modes of application of the AMF inoculum were evaluated, of which, combined application of AMF at the seedling production and transplanting stages showed increased AMF , which significantly improved grain yield by 25.08% and also increased uptake of phosphorus by 18.% and nitrogen by 49.5%, as observed at 700-ppm CO concentration. Organic acids secretion in rice root increased in AMF-inoculated plants exposed to 700-ppm CO concentration. To understand the overall effect of CO elevation on AMF interaction with the rice plant, principal component and partial least square regression analysis were performed, which found both positive and negative responses under elevated CO concentration.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Knowledge on when and where MRSA  is acquired and what clones are involved is necessary, to focus efforts for prevention of hospital-acquired MRSA-infections.A prospective/longitudinal cohort study was performed in eight Argentina hospitals (Cordoba/ October-December/2014). Surveillance cultures for MRSA (nose-throat-inguinal) were obtained on admission and at discharge. MRSA strains were genetically typed as CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA genotypes.Overall, 1419 patients were screened and 534 stayed at hospital for ≥3 days. S. aureus admission prevalence was 30.9% and 4.% for MRSA. Overall MRSA acquisition rate was .3/1000 patient-days-at-risk with a MRSA acquisition prevalence of 1.96% (95%CI: 1.0%-3.4%); 3.% of patients were discharged back to community with MRSA. CA-MRSA accounted for 84.6% of imported, 100.0% of hospital-acquired and 94% of discharged MRSA strains. Most imported and acquired MRSA strains belonged to two major epidemic CA-MRSA clones spread in Argentina: PFGEtypeI-ST5-IVa-t311-PVL and PFGEtypeN/ST30-IVc-t019-PVL.CA-MRSA clones, particularly ST5-IV-PVL and ST30-IV-PVL, with main reservoir in the community, not only enter but also are truly acquired within hospital, causing healthcare-associated-hospital-onset infections, having a transmission capacity greater or similar than HA-MRSA. This information is essential to develop appropriate MRSA infection prevention-control programs, considering hospital and community.Copyright © 2019 The British Infection Association.

The plant-PGPR interaction, with special reference to chemical signalling molecules is not understood clearly, unlike other beneficial plant-microbe interactions. Chemo-attraction of a PGPR from soil microbial pool towards a plant could be dependent on some of the molecules in the plant root exudates (REs), similar to the beneficial association of legume-rhizobia. In this study, a few functional properties of PGPR like growth, chemotaxis, and biofilm formation by two PGPR strains viz., Bacillus sonorensis RS4 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa RP2 were assessed in the presence of groundnut REs. Functional properties of both the strains were significantly influenced by the REs in a strain-dependent manner. Metabolite profiling of the REs from PGPR-bacterized (RS4 or RP2) and non-bacterized seedlings was performed with GC-MS/MS after 12 and 24 days of growth. A total of 75 metabolites were detected in groundnut REs. Threonine and glyoxylic oxime acid were detected in RP2-bacterized REs, while serine, pentanoic acid, glucopyranoside, tartaric acid, and -pyrrolidinone were detected in REs of seedlings bacterized with RP2 and RS4. The results suggested that the PGPR induced distinct variations in the REs. Identification of the interaction-specific metabolites will be useful to develop effective PGPR based bio-formulations for better PGPR  and improving crop yields.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

It quickens the recovery period by its hyperemic effect on the exposed zone, decreasing bacterial , preventing tissue edema, and promoting granulation of the wound. However, its use in anastomotic leak after IPAA is scarcely studied, especially because a proprietary endoluminal vacuum-assisted closure system was removed from the US market.We applied a hand-crafted endoluminal vacuum-assisted closure system using the existing standard wound vacuum-assisted closure supplies to  patients who developed an anastomotic leak with a presacral abscess after completion proctectomy with J-pouch construction.We changed the endoluminal vacuum-assisted closure drain every  to 3 days, and both patients had substantial improvements in their abscess cavity after the seventh and ninth applications.Anastomotic leak at the IPAA traditionally takes up to a year to heal, which causes a significant toll on the psychosocial life of the patient and delayed stoma closure. Therefore, we believe that facilitating the healing process by using our hand-crafted endoluminal vacuum-assisted closure drain might provide a great value to patients' quality of life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586099>Climatic niche characteristics of native and invasive Lilium lancifolium.</a></h2><p>One of the topics currently under discussion in biological invasions is whether the species' climatic niche has been conserved or, alternatively, has diverged during invasions. Here, we explore niche dynamic processes using the complex invasion history model of Lilium lancifolium, which is the first tested case of a native species (Korea) with two hypothesized spatial (regional and intercontinental) and temporal arrivals: (1) as an archaeophyte in East Asia (before AD 1500); and () as a neophyte in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand (after AD 1500). Following a niche examination through both environmental and geographical spaces, the species in the archaeophyte range has apparently filled the ancestral native niche and, rather, would have increased it considerably. The species as a neophyte shows a closer climatic match with the archaeophyte range than with the native one. This pattern of niche similarity suggests that the neophyte range was probably colonized by a subset of archaeophyte propagules adapted to local climate that promoted the species' establishment. Overall, niche conservatism is proposed at each  step, from native to archaeophyte, and from archaeophyte to neophyte ranges. We detected signals of an advanced invasion stage within the archaeophyte range and traces of an early introduction stage in neophyte ranges.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630386>Concealed Penis after Circumcision: Is It Beneficial in Lowering Uropathogenic  in Penile Skin and Preventing Recurrence of Febrile Urinary Tract Infections?</a></h2><p>  To  discuss  whether  concealed  penis  after  circumcision  lowers  perimeatal  urethral  and  glanular  sulcus  uropathogenic  bacterial    in  healthy  boys  with  no  urinary  tract  problems  and  prevents  attacks  of  febrile  urinary  tract  infections  in  non-healthy  boys  with  defined  urinary  tract  abnormalities. Materials and Methods:  This  case-control  study  was  conducted  in  Ibn-i  Sina  Hospital  and  retrospectively  collected  data  of   471 boys  were  analyzed.  All  patients  were  scanned  for  any  urinary  tract  abnormality  and  those  with  any  defined  abnormalities  were  classified  as  non-healthy  group.

We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of oral vancomycin for the prevention of health care facility-onset CDI (HCFO-CDI) in targeted patients.We conducted a randomized, prospective, open-label study at Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina between October 2018 and April 2019. Included patients were randomized 1:1 to either oral vancomycin (dosed at 125 mg once daily while receiving systemic antibiotics and continued for 5 days post completion of systemic antibiotics [OVP]), or no prophylaxis. The primary endpoint was incidence of HCFO-CDI. Secondary endpoints included incidence of community-onset healthcare facility-associated CDI (CO-HCFA-CDI), incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE)  after receiving OVP, adverse effects and cost of OVP.A total of 100 patients were evaluated, 50 patients in each arm. Baseline and hospitalization characteristics were similar, except antibiotic exposure. No events of HCFO-CDI were noted in the OVP group compared to 6 (12%) in the no prophylaxis group (p = 0.03). CO-HCFA-CDI was identified in  patients who were previously diagnosed with HCFO-CDI. No patients developed new VRE  with only 1 patient reporting mild gastrointestinal side effects to OVP. A total of 600 doses of OVP were given during the study, with each patient receiving an average of 12 doses. Total acquisition cost of OVP was $1302, $26.04 per patient.OVP appears to protect against HCFO-CDI during in-patient stay in targeted patients during systemic antibiotic exposure.

Nevertheless, cell subpopulations displaying intrinsic radioresistance survive after RT. The reactivation of their proliferation and successful  at local or distant sites may increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes. Recently, radioresistant cancer cells surviving RT were reported to exhibit a more aggressive phenotype than parental cells, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.By investigating public databases containing CRC patient data, we explored potential radioresistance-associated signaling pathways. Then, their mechanistic roles in radioresistance were investigated through multiple validation steps using patient-derived primary CRC cells, human CRC cell lines, and CRC xenografts.Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling was activated in radioresistant CRC tissues in correlation with local and distant metastases. JAK2 was preferentially overexpressed in the CRC stem cell subpopulation, which was accompanied by the phosphorylation of STAT proteins, especially STAT3. JAK2/STAT3 signaling played an essential role in promoting tumor initiation and radioresistance by limiting apoptosis and enhancing clonogenic potential. Mechanistically, the direct binding of STAT3 to the cyclin D2 (CCND2) promoter increased CCND2 transcription. CCND2 expression was required for persistent cancer stem cell (CSC) growth via the maintenance of an intact cell cycle and proliferation with low levels of DNA damage accumulation.Herein, we first identified JAK2/STAT3/CCND2 signaling as a resistance mechanism for the persistent growth of CSCs after RT, suggesting potential biomarkers and regimens for improving outcomes among CRC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654616>Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in cystic fibrosis.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the demographics, genotype, and clinical presentation of pediatric patients presenting with distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), and factors associated with DIOS recurrence.Case series of ten patients (median age 13. years), followed-up in a reference center, retrospectively assessed. Data analyzed included age, gender, cystic fibrosis genotype, meconium ileus at birth, hydration status, pulmonary exacerbation, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , pancreatic insufficiency (PI), body mass index (BMI) at the episodes, clinical manifestations of DIOS, imaging studies performed, acute management of DIOS, maintenance therapy, and recurrence on follow-up.All patients had two positive sweat chloride tests, and nine of ten also had genotype study. The most common genotype identified was homozygosis for the delta F508 mutation. In seven cases, a previous history of meconium ileus was reported. All patients had pancreatic insufficiency. Diagnosis of DIOS was based on clinical and imaging findings. Of the total number of episodes, 85% were successfully managed with oral osmotic laxatives and/or rectal therapy (glycerin enema or saline irrigation). Recurrence was observed in five of ten patients.In this first report of pediatric DIOS in South America, the presence of two risk factors for DIOS occurrence was universal: pancreatic insufficiency and severe genotype. Medical history of meconium ileus at birth was present in most patients, as well as in the subgroup with DIOS recurrence. The diagnosis relied mainly on the clinical presentation and on abdominal imaging. The practices in the management of episodes varied, likely reflecting changes in the management of this syndrome throughout time.Copyright © 2019.

Little data is available on how the composition of the vaginal microbiota, and other risk factors, are associated with the molecular detection of Candida albicans-a common cause of vulvovaginal candidiasis.In a cross-sectional study, self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained from 394 nonpregnant, reproductive-age women. C. albicans was detected using polymerase chain reaction targeting C. albicans ITS1/ region. Vaginal microbiota was characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the V3 to V4 hypervariable regions and clustered into community state types (CSTs). Multiple logistic regression identified factors associated with C. albicans detection.Twenty-one percent had C. albicans detected and 46% reported vaginal symptoms in the prior 60 days. There was a -fold increase in the odds of C. albicans if a woman was in a L. crispatus-dominated CST compared to CSTs with low-Lactobacillus levels (adjusted odds ratio, .05; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-4.37). History of self-treatment with antifungals, L. crispatus relative abundance, and receptive oral sex were also significantly associated with C. albicans detection.A L. crispatus-dominated vaginal microbiota is thought to protect women from both development of bacterial vaginosis and incidence of sexually transmitted infections; however, our data suggest that L. crispatus is associated with increased C. albicans detection.

For livestock, highest prevalences have been reported in broiler chickens, which are therefore considered as a reservoir of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The possibility of transfer to humans either by a close contact to colonized broiler flocks or through contaminated retail meat results in the necessity to develop intervention measures for the entire broiler production chain. In this regard, a basic understanding of the  process is mandatory including the determination of the minimal bacterial load leading to a persistent  of broiler chickens. Therefore, we conducted a bivalent broiler  study close to real farming conditions without applying any antimicrobial selection pressure. ESBL- and AmpC- negative broiler chickens (Ross 308) were co- colonized on their third day of life with two strains: one CTX-M-15-producing -ST410 and one CMY-/-1-positive -ST10.  was assessed by cloacal swabs over the period of the trial, starting 24 h post inoculation. During the final necropsy, the contents of crop, jejunum, cecum, and colon were quantified for the occurrence of both bacterial strains. To define the minimal oral  dosage 10 to 10 colony forming units (cfu) were orally inoculated to four separately housed broiler groups (each  = 19, all animals inoculated) and a dosage of already 10 cfu  led to a persistent  of all animals of the group after 3 days. To assure stable , however, a dosage of 10 cfu  was chosen for the subsequent seeder-bird trial. In the seeder-bird trial one fifth of the animals (seeder,  = 4) were orally inoculated and kept together with the non-inoculated animals (sentinel,  = 16) to mimic the route of natural infection. After 35 days of trial, all animals were colonized with both  strains. Given the low  dosage and the low seeder/sentinel ratio, the rapid spread of ESBL- and AmpC- producing Enterobacteriaceae in conventional broiler farms currently seems inevitably resulting in an urgent need for the development of intervention strategies to reduce  of broilers during production.Copyright © 2019 Robé, Blasse, Merle, Friese, Roesler and Guenther.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659938>Addressing multidrug resistant pathogens in pediatric palliative care patients-the nurses point of view: A qualitative study.</a></h2><p>Multidrug resistant pathogens are a large-scale healthcare issue. In particular, children with life-limiting conditions have a significantly increased risk of multidrug resistant pathogen . Official hygiene requirements recommend children, who are colonized with multidrug resistant pathogens, to be isolated. In the context of pediatric palliative care, such isolation adversely affects the aim of social participation. To overcome this challenge of conflicting interests on a pediatric palliative care inpatient unit, a hygiene concept for patients colonized with multidrug resistant pathogens, called PALLINI, was implemented.The aim of this study was to identify the nurses' attitudes and opinions toward PALLINI.Nurses ( = 14) from the pediatric palliative care unit were queried in guideline-oriented interviews. Interviews were analyzed qualitatively by means of content analysis.The following four categories were identified: (1) safety, () effort, (3) quality of care, and (4) participation. All categories demonstrated ambivalence by nursing staff regarding PALLINI. Ambivalence arose from guaranteeing infection control versus noncompliance by the families, additional workload for patients with multidrug resistant pathogens versus lack of resources, impaired relationship with the parents versus enabling better care for the child, as well as enabling some limited contact versus the larger goal of genuine social participation. Despite this, nurses reported the importance of arranging everyday-life for the patients so that they experience as much social participation as possible.The implementation of a new hygiene concept is challenging. Despite positive reception of PALLINI from the nurses, ambivalence remained. Addressing these ambivalences may be critical to best implement the new hygiene concept.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632380>Pneumococcal VncR Strain-Specifically Regulates Capsule Polysaccharide Synthesis.</a></h2><p>Capsular polysaccharides (CPS), a major virulence factor in , become thicker during blood invasion while not during asymptomatic nasopharyngeal . However, the underlying mechanism controlling this differential pneumococcal CPS regulation remain unclear. Here, we show how VncR, the response regulator of the vancomycin resistance locus ( operon), regulates CPS expression in  mutants in three serotype (type , 3, and 6B) backgrounds upon exposure to serum lactoferrin (LF). Comparative analysis of CPS levels in the wild type (WT) of three strains and their isogenic  mutants after LF exposure revealed a strain-specific alteration in CPS production. Consistently, VncR-mediated strain-specific CPS production is correlated with pneumococcal virulence, . Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay and co-immunoprecipitation revealed an interaction between VncR and the  promoter () in the presence of serum. In addition,  analysis uncovered this protein-DNA interaction, suggesting that VncR binds with the , and recognizes the strain-specific significance of the tandem repeats in . Taken together, the interaction of VncR and  after serum exposure plays an essential role in regulating differential strain-specific CPS production, which subsequently determines strain-specific systemic virulence. This study highlights how host protein LF contributes to pneumococcal VncR-mediated CPS production. As CPS plays a significant role in immune evasion, these findings suggest that drugs designed to interrupt the VncR-mediated CPS production could help to combat pneumococcal infections.Copyright © 2019 Ghosh, Shah, Ravichandran, Park, Iqbal, Choi, Kim and Rhee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578543>Mapping of Shigella flexneri's tissue distribution and type III secretion apparatus activity during infection of the large intestine of guinea pigs.</a></h2><p>Shigella spp. are bacterial pathogens that invade the human colonic mucosa using a Type III Secretion Apparatus (T3SA), a proteinaceous device activated upon contact with host cells. Active T3SAs translocate proteins that carve the intracellular niche of Shigella spp.. Nevertheless, the activation state of the T3SA has not been addressed in vivo. Here, we used a GFP transcription-based secretion activity reporter (TSAR) to provide a spatio-temporal description of S. flexneri T3SAs activity in the colon of Guinea pigs. First, we observed that early mucus release is triggered in the vicinity of luminal bacteria with inactive T3SA. Subsequent mucosal invasion showed bacteria with active T3SA associated with the brush border, eventually penetrating into epithelial cells. From  to 8 hours post-challenge, the infection foci expanded, and these intracellular bacteria displayed homogeneously high-secreting activity, while extracellular foci within the lamina propria featured bacteria with low secretion activity. We also found evidence that within lamina propria macrophages, bacteria reside in vacuoles instead of accessing the cytosol. Finally, bacteria were cleared from tissues between 8 and 24 hours post-challenge, highlighting the hit-and-run  strategy of Shigella.

Although GBS is known to exhibit vast diversity in virulence across strains, the mechanisms of GBS-associated pathogenesis are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that GBS strains of different genotypes would vary in their ability to elicit host inflammatory responses, and that strains associated with neonatal disease would induce different cytokine profiles than those associated with . Using a multiplexed, antibody-based protein detection array, we found that production of a discrete number of inflammatory mediators by THP-1 macrophage-like cells was universally induced in response to challenge with each of five genetically distinct GBS isolates, while other responses appeared to be strain-specific. Key array responses were validated by ELISA using the initial five strains as well as ten additional strains with distinct genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Interestingly, IL-6 was significantly elevated following infection with neonatal infection-associated sequence type (ST)-17 strains and among strains possessing capsule (cps) type III. Significant differences in production of IL1-β, IL-10 and MCP- were also identified across STs and cps types. These data support our hypothesis and suggest that unique host innate immune responses reflect strain-specific differences in virulence across GBS isolates.

In particular, the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin-which has been associated with beta human papillomavirus (β-HPV) infection-is increased by more than 100-fold in immunosuppressed patients. Previous studies have not established a causative role for HPVs in driving the development of skin cancer. Here we show that T cell immunity against commensal papillomaviruses suppresses skin cancer in immunocompetent hosts, and the loss of this immunity-rather than the oncogenic effect of HPVs-causes the markedly increased risk of skin cancer in immunosuppressed patients. To investigate the effects of papillomavirus on carcinogen-driven skin cancer, we colonized several strains of immunocompetent mice with mouse papillomavirus type 1 (MmuPV1). Mice with natural immunity against MmuPV1 after  and acquired immunity through the transfer of T cells from immune mice or by MmuPV1 vaccination were protected against skin carcinogenesis induced by chemicals or by ultraviolet radiation in a manner dependent on CD8 T cells. RNA and DNA in situ hybridization probes for 25 commensal β-HPVs revealed a significant reduction in viral activity and load in human skin cancer compared with the adjacent healthy skin, suggesting a strong immune selection against virus-positive malignant cells. Consistently, E7 peptides from β-HPVs activated CD8 T cells from unaffected human skin. Our findings reveal a beneficial role for commensal viruses and establish a foundation for immune-based approaches that could block the development of skin cancer by boosting immunity against the commensal HPVs present in all of our skin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633059>Endophyte  evade plant defense by producing lantibiotic subtilomycin to mask self-produced flagellin.</a></h2><p>Microbes can enter into healthy plants as endophytes and confer beneficial functions.

It is critical to ensure Indigenous people's equitable access to new direct acting antiviral HCV treatments (DAAs). Identifying culturally-safe, healing-centered approaches that support the wellbeing of Indigenous people living with HCV is an essential step toward this goal. We listened to the stories and perspectives of HCV-affected Indigenous people and HCV treatment providers with the aim of providing pragmatic recommendations for decolonizing HCV care.Forty-five semi-structured interviews were carried out with Indigenous participants affected by HCV from the Cedar Project (n = 20, British Columbia (BC)) and the Canadian Coinfection Cohort (n = 25, BC; Ontario (ON); Saskatchewan (SK)). In addition, 10 HCV treatment providers were interviewed (n = 4 BC, n = 4 ON, n =  SK). Interpretive description identified themes to inform clinical approaches and public health HCV care. Themes and related recommendations were validated by Indigenous health experts and Indigenous participants prior to coding and re-contextualization.Taken together, participants' stories and perceptions were interpreted to coalesce into three overarching and interdependent themes representing their recommendations. First: treatment providers must understand and accept  as a determinant of health and wellness among HCV-affected Indigenous people, including ongoing cycles of child apprehension and discrimination within the healthcare system. Second: consistently safe attitudes and actions create trust within HCV treatment provider-patient relationships and open opportunities for engagement into care. Third: treatment providers who identify, build, and strengthen circles of care will have greater success engaging HCV-affected Indigenous people who have used drugs into care.There are several pragmatic ways to integrate Truth and Reconciliation as well as Indigenous concepts of whole-person wellness into the HCV cascade of care. By doing so, HCV treatment providers have an opportunity to create greater equity and support long-term wellness of Indigenous patients.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Whether this phenomenon exists in cattle is largely unknown. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to evaluate the impact of maternal post-ruminal supply of methionine during late-pregnancy in dairy cows on fecal microbiota and metabolome in neonatal calves, and their association with body development and growth performance during the preweaning period. To achieve this, heifer calves, i.e., neonatal female offspring, born to Holstein cows receiving either a control (CON) diet ( = 13) or CON plus rumen-protected methionine (MET; Evonik Nutrition & Care GmbH) during the last 28 days of pregnancy were used. Fecal samples from heifers were collected from birth until 6 weeks of age, i.e., the preweaning period. Fecal microbiota was analyzed with QIIME  whereas fecal metabolites were measured using an untargeted LC-MS approach. At birth, MET heifers had greater ( ≤ 0.05) BW, HH, and WH. During the preweaning period, no differences between groups were detected for starter intake ( = 0.77). However, MET heifers maintained greater ( ≤ 0.05) BW, HH and tended ( = 0.06) to have greater WH and average daily gain (ADG) ( = 0.10). Fecal microbiota and metabolome profiles through 42 days of age in MET heifers indicated greater capacity for hindgut production of endogenous antibiotics and enhanced hindgut functionality and health. Enhancing maternal post-ruminal supply of methionine during late-gestation in dairy cows has a positive effect on hindgut functionality and health in their offspring through alterations in the fecal microbiota and metabolome without affecting feed intake. Those alterations could limit pathogen  of the hindgut while providing essential nutrients to the neonate. Together, such responses contribute to the ability of young calves to achieve better rates of nutrient utilization for growth.Copyright © 2019 Elolimy, Alharthi, Zeineldin, Parys, Helmbrecht and Loor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603617>Arctic shrub  lagged peak postglacial warmth: Molecular evidence in lake sediment from Arctic Canada.</a></h2><p>Arctic shrubification is an observable consequence of climate change, already resulting in ecological shifts and global-scale climate feedbacks including changes in land surface albedo and enhanced evapotranspiration. However, the rate at which shrubs can colonize previously glaciated terrain in a warming world is largely unknown. Reconstructions of past vegetation dynamics in conjunction with climate records can provide critical insights into shrubification rates and controls on plant migration, but paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on pollen may be biased by the influx of exotic pollen to tundra settings. Here, we reconstruct past plant communities using sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA), which has a more local source area than pollen. We additionally reconstruct past temperature variability using bacterial cell membrane lipids (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) and an aquatic productivity indicator (biogenic silica) to evaluate the relative timing of postglacial ecological and climate changes at a lake on southern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada. The sedaDNA record tightly constrains the  of dwarf birch (Betula, a thermophilous shrub) to 5.9 ± 0.1 ka, ~3 ka after local deglaciation as determined by cosmogenic  Be moraine dating and > ka later than Betula pollen is recorded in nearby lake sediment. We then assess the paleovegetation history within the context of summer temperature and find that paleotemperatures were highest prior to 6.3 ka, followed by cooling in the centuries preceding Betula establishment. Together, these molecular proxies reveal that Betula  lagged peak summer temperatures, suggesting that inefficient dispersal, rather than climate, may have limited Arctic shrub migration in this region. In addition, these data suggest that pollen-based climate reconstructions from high latitudes, which rely heavily on the presence and abundance of pollen from thermophilous taxa like Betula, can be compromised by both exotic pollen fluxes and vegetation migration lags.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447204>The relation between positive screening results and MRSA infections in burn patients.</a></h2><p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a key pathogen in burn patients.

MRSA cultures taken at admission and on weekly surveillance screening, including nasal, perianal, and wound swabs, were reviewed. To determine associations between MRSA  and infection rates, both MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative swab cultures were included in the analysis. Several risk factors were considered: age, gender, ethnicity, %TBSA, BAUX index, inhalational injury, ICU admission and days, need for ventilator support and days, length of stay (LOS) in hospital, and complications. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to predict correlations between positive swab cultures and risk factors.Data from 396 patients were reviewed. The median age at admission for the burn patients was 46 (IQR: 31-59) years. On admission, .5% of patients were MRSA positive, whereas 17.9% were found to be MRSA positive on weekly surveillance screening. At surveillance, 60.6% developed an infection secondary to MRSA . An MRSA infection was not identified for any patient who did not have at least one positive admission or surveillance swab. A statistically significant association was found between any positive swab and MRSA infection (P < 0.001). The median number of complications reported in the MRSA-positive group was  (IQR: 1-3) versus 0 (IQR: 0-1) in the MRSA-negative group and the median length of hospital stay in the MRSA-positive group was 34.5 (IQR: 20.25-56.25) days versus 7 (IQR: 3-16) days in the MRSA-negative group (P < 0.001).Nosocomial MRSA  rates are high, and patients incurring infections experience a greater than average LOS in hospital and complications. Over 60% of patients who had a positive swab culture at surveillance developed an infection, whereas, no patient with a negative MRSA swab status developed an infection.

Potential sources of contamination in the operating room include pneumatic tourniquets, blood pressure cuffs, and stethoscopes, among others. Our study aims to investigate microbial  on reusable pneumatic tourniquets stored and used in the orthopedic department of our institution and evaluate the efficacy of the cleaning protocols employed. Methods Over a course of two weeks, 26 samples were obtained. A total of 14 pneumatic tourniquets were sampled preoperatively on Monday morning following the weekly cleaning protocol of soaking the tourniquets in sodium hypochlorite for 30 minutes while 12 tourniquets were cultured immediately following the postoperative cleaning protocol of wiping the tourniquet clean with a cloth soaked in sodium hypochlorite. Samples were cultured on MacConkey and sheep blood agar and incubated at 37-degrees centigrade for a total of 48 hours. Organisms were identified and colony count was documented. The analysis was performed using the Fisher Exact test on SPSS v23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US). Results All 14 samples obtained after being soaked in sodium hypochlorite for 30 minutes cultured negative. However, four out of 12 (33%) samples obtained after simply wiping the pneumatic tourniquet with a cloth soaked in sodium hypochlorite cultured coagulase-negative Staphylococci. The difference between the two was significant (p=0.002). Conclusion Postoperative tourniquets, wiped with a cloth soaked in sodium hypochlorite and ready to be used on the next patient, were found to be contaminated with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. This species is notorious for causing surgical site infections following implant-related surgeries potentially through direct inoculation and cross-infections intraoperatively and in storage.

All cases ( = 21) of fulminant CDI had a CT-toxin result. Index CT-toxin patients were significantly more likely to have a CT-toxin result within 90 days than CT-toxin patients (17.4% [ = 49] versus 8.0% [ = 16], respectively;  = 0.003). Thirty-day all-cause mortality was higher in CT-toxin patients (11.1% versus 6.8%;  = 0.1), though no deaths in CT-toxin patients were directly attributable to CDI. Of the 200 CT-toxin patients, 51.5% ( = 103) were treated for CDI. The rates of conversion to a CT-toxin result (8.8% versus 7.%;  = 0.8) and all-cause mortality (8.8% versus 13.4%;  = 0.3) were similar between treated and untreated CT-toxin patients, respectively.  -based toxin prediction may identify patients at higher risk for CDI-related complications and reduce treatment among CT-toxin patients.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661468>C4BP-IgM protein as a novel therapeutic approach to treat Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections.</a></h2><p>Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection with 87 million new cases per year globally. Increasing antibiotic resistance has severely limited treatment options. A mechanism that Neisseria gonorrhoeae uses to evade complement attack is binding of the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP). We screened 107 PorB1a and 83 PorB1b clinical isolates randomly selected from a Swedish strain collection over the last 10 years and noted that 96/107 (89.7%) PorB1a and 16/83 (19.3%) PorB1b bound C4BP; C4BP binding significantly correlated with the ability to evade complement-dependent killing (r = 0.78; p<0.0001). We designed two chimeric proteins that fused C4BP domains to the backbone of immunoglobulins IgG or IgM (C4BP-IgG; C4BP-IgM) with the aim of enhancing complement activation and killing of gonococci. Both proteins bound gonococci (Kd C4BP-IgM = .4 nM; Kd C4BP-IgG 981 nM), but only hexameric C4BP-IgM efficiently out-competed heptameric C4BP from bacterial surface resulting in enhanced complement deposition and bacterial killing. Furthermore, C4BP-IgM significantly attenuated the duration and burden of  of two C4BP-binding gonococcal isolates, but not a C4BP non-binding strain in the mouse vaginal  model using human factor H/C4BP transgenic mice. Our pre-clinical data present C4BP-IgM as an adjunctive to conventional antimicrobials for the treatment of gonorrhea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468999>Efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation for decolonization of intestinal multidrug-resistant microorganism carriage: beyond  infection.</a></h2><p>Persistent reservoirs of multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MDRO) that are prevalent in hospital settings and communities can lead to the spread of MDRO. Currently, there are no effective decolonization strategies, especially non-pharmacological strategies without antibiotic regimens. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the eradication of MDRO. A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies on the use of FMT for the decolonization of MDRO. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception through January 2019. Of the 1395 articles identified, 20 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Overall, the efficacy of FMT for the eradication of each MDRO was 70.3% (102/146) in 121 patients from the 20 articles. The efficacy rates were 68.% (30/44) for gram-positive bacteria and 70.6% (72/102) for gram-negative bacteria. Minor adverse events, including vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and ileus, were reported in patients who received FMT. FMT could be a promising strategy to eradicate MDRO in patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish a comprehensive FMT protocol for standardized treatment. Key messages The development of new antibiotics lags behind the emergence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MDRO). New strategies are needed. Theoretically, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) might recover the diversity and function of commensal microbiota from dysbiosis in MDRO carriers and help restore  resistance to pathogens. A literature review indicated that FMT could be a promising strategy to eradicate MDRO in patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481134>Outcomes of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing Enterobacteriaceae  among patients abdominal surgery patients.</a></h2><p>Preoperative enteric screening for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae was conducted in 360 patients prospectively observed for surgical site infection (SSI).

In 2016 we conducted a cross-sectional entomological survey to describe the preferred larval habitats of  in Zanzibar City, the main urban area of the Zanzibar archipelago. The surveys for container habitats were conducted for a 17-wk period beginning in January 2016. Immature stages (larvae and pupae) were collected, reared to adulthood, and identified to species. The positive and potential habitats were categorized on the basis of physical, biological, and chemical parameters. A total of 200 samples were collected, of which 124 (62.0%) were positive for immature stages of mosquitoes and 114 (92%) for  larvae and pupae. Presence of vegetation (odds ratio [OR] = .11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-3.74), organic matter (OR = .37, 95% CI = 1.21-4.60), inorganic matter (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.01-3.13), and sun exposure (OR = .34, 95% CI = 1.24-4.36) were all significantly associated with the presence of immature stages of , suggesting that these conditions promote  of containers. Plastic containers supported 64% of the immature stages and produced approximately 50% of the pupae.

We aimed to determine factors associated with hand hygiene adherence in NFs and to assess rates of ARO acquisition among healthcare personnel (HCP).HCP were observed during routine care at 6 NFs. We recorded hand hygiene adherence, glove use, activities, and time in room. HCP hands were cultured before and after patient care; patients and high-touch surfaces were cultured. HCP activities were categorized as high-versus low-risk for self-contamination. Multivariable regression was performed to identify predictors of hand hygiene adherence.We recorded 385 HCP observations and paired them with cultures performed before and after patient care. Hand hygiene adherence occurred in 96 of 352 observations (27.3%) before patient care and 165 of 358 observations (46.1%) after patient care. Gloves were worn in 169 of 376 observations (44.9%). Higher adherence was associated with glove use before patient care (odds ratio [OR], .55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-4.54) and after patient care (OR, 3.11; 95% CI, 1.77-5.48). Compared with nurses, certified nurse assistants had lower hand hygiene adherence (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15-0.67) before patient care and physical/occupational therapists (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.11-0.44) after patient care.

The purpose of this study was firstly to determine the prevalence of pneumococcus carriage in a population of febrile infants in Marrakesh and secondly, to investigate the risk factors for carriage and the distribution of circulating serotypes.This prospective study was conducted from February to June 2017, in the pediatric emergency department of the Mother and Child Hospital of Mohammed VI University Hospital Centre (UHC) in Marrakesh. At total of 183febrile infants, aged -18months, were enrolled in this study and were swabbed for nasopharyngeal carriage. Pneumococci were cultured, identified, serotyped, and tested for penicillin susceptibility. Demographic data and risk factors for carriage were collected. The statistical analyses performed were the following: the analysis of the risk factors using logistic regression, the estimation of serotype diversity with the Simpson index, and the Chi test to compare serotype distribution in the prevaccination (a cohort of 660 healthy children, less than 2years old, in the Marrakesh region, in 2008-2009) and postvaccination periods.The prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage was 68.3%. Of the 183infants enrolled in this study, 111 had received at least one dose of PCV-10.  by vaccine serotype among febrile children was related to incomplete vaccination status. In total, vaccine serotypes accounted for 6.4% (n=8): 19F (n=), 1 (n=) and one strain for each of the following serotypes: 14, 23F, 6B, and 9V. Non-vaccine and nontypeable strains presented 63.% and 23.%, respectively, with dominance of serotypes 6A (6.4%), 15A/15F (5.6%), 20, 22F/22A, 23B, and 11A/11D with a prevalence of 3.%. The rate of pneumococcus strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin was 33.6%, of which 90.% were non-vaccine serotypes and nontypeable strains. Serotype diversity increased in the postvaccination period and the effectiveness of PCV-10 against vaccine serotypes was estimated at 89.6%.An important change in the distribution of vaccine and non-vaccine serotypes was observed after the introduction of the PCVs. In fact, the prevalence of vaccine serotypes decreased significantly while non-vaccine serotypes emerged. These results underscore the importance of maintaining close and prolonged surveillance of serotype distribution to monitor the dynamics of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage.Copyright © 2019 French Society of Pediatrics.

Over two centuries, the East India Company and the British empire siphoned out at least £ 9. trillion; or $44.6 trillion; since the exchange rate was $4.8 per pound sterling during much of the colonial period. It is to be noted that the life expectancy of Indians at birth was just 22 years in 1911. Food grain was available, however the purchasing power of ordinary Indians was being squeezed. The per capita annual consumption of food grains went down from 200kg in 1900 to 157kg on the eve of World War II, and further down to 37kg by 1946 (Prof Utsa Patnaik). The Indian sub-continent has still not recovered from the systemic malnutrition inflicted upon the population. Today, just under two billion people, or a quarter of the earth's population, live in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The landlocked populations of these countries are known as the black hole of humanity, waiting for ultimate catastrophe- either natural or man-made humanitarian crisis. What happens to these countries now was determined long before and planned by the British empire when their representatives packed bags and transferred power to the local natives. The partition of India was the most tragic ever human genocide artificially perpetrated in the human history. More than 14 million people were displaced and close to two million people died or went missing. It was the parting gift by the British empire to the people of the Indian sub-continent. This was more tragic than the holocaust. A permanent scar and hatred that would not heal even after a century was created by the British empire. The 200 years of anti-incumbency and hatred against the British was forgotten and used to build a civil war. Enough hatred was fumed between the native population of India and Pakistan. This hatred was further institutionalized between the two countries by having them develop separate militaries. It was a grand exit plan for the empire, leaving behind no traces of the crime, while keeping their aura of pride and benevolence intact. After seventy years, it is important to revisit the political circumstances prevailing during the colonial period. It is important for the people India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to think about the future and not be victims of the political game rolled out as an exit plan by the empire.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498261>Partially Melted Ti6Al4V Particles Increase Bacterial Adhesion and Inhibit Osteogenic Activity on 3D-printed Implants: An In Vitro Study.</a></h2><p>A porous Ti6Al4V implant that is manufactured using selective laser melting (SLM) has broad potential applications in the field of orthopaedic implants. The pore structure of the SLM porous Ti6Al4V implant allows for cell migration and osteogenic differentiation, which is favorable for bone ingrowth and osseointegration. However, it is unclear whether the pore structure and partially melted Ti6Al4V particles on a SLM porous Ti6Al4V implant will increase bacterial adhesion and, perhaps, the risk of implant-related infection.(1) Is there more bacterial adhesion and  on SLM porous Ti6Al4V implants than on polished orthopaedic implants? () Do partially melted Ti6Al4V particles on SLM porous Ti6Al4V implants reduce human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) adhesion, viability, and activity?To determine bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, we incubated five different Ti6Al4V discs (polished, grit-blasted, plasma-sprayed, particle SLM porous, and nonparticle SLM porous discs) with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli. Bacterial coverage on the surface of the five different Ti6Al4V discs were evaluated based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images quantitatively. In addition, a spread-plate method was used to quantitatively evaluate the bacterial adhesion on those implants. The biofilm formation was stained with crystal violet and semi-quantitatively determined with a microplate reader. The morphology and adhesion of hBMSCs on the five Ti6Al4V discs were observed with SEM. The cell viability was quantitatively evaluated with a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. In addition, the osteogenic activity was determined in vitro with a quantitatively alkaline phosphatase activity assay and alizarin-red staining. For semiquantitative analysis, the alizarin-red stained mineralized nodules were dissolved and determined with a microplate reader.The polished discs had the lowest MRSA adhesion (8.3% ± .6%) compared with grit-blasted (19.1% ± 3.9%; p = 0.006), plasma-sprayed (38.5% ± 5.3%; p < 0.001), particle (23.1% ± .8%; p < 0.001), and nonparticle discs (15.7% ± .5%; p = 0.003). Additionally, when comparing the two SLM discs, we found that particle discs had higher bacterial coverage than nonparticle discs (23.1% ± .8% versus 15.7% ± .5%; p = 0.020). An E. coli analysis showed similar results, with the higher adhesion to particle SLM discs than to nonparticle discs (20.7% ± 4.% versus 14.4% ± 3.6%; p = 0.011). In addition, on particle SLM porous discs, bacterial colonies were localized around the partially melted Ti6Al4V particles, based on SEM images. After a 7-day incubation period, the cell viability in the particle group (optical density value 0.72 ± 0.05) was lower than that in the nonparticle groups (optical density value: 0.87 ± 0.08; p = 0.003). Alkaline phosphatase activity, as a marker of osteogenic differentiation, was lower in the particle group than in the nonparticle group (1.32 ± 0.12 U/mL versus 1.58 ± 0.09 U/mL; p = 0.012).Higher bacterial adhesion was observed on SLM porous discs than on polished discs. The partially melted Ti6Al4V particles on SLM porous discs not only enhanced bacterial adhesion but also inhibited the osteogenic activity of hBMSCs. Postprocessing treatment is necessary to remove partially melted Ti6Al4V particles on an SLM implant before further use. Additional studies are needed to determine whether an SLM porous Ti6Al4V implant increases the risk of implant-related infection in vivo.As implants with porous Ti6Al4V made using SLM are being designed, our preliminary findings suggest that postprocessing treatment is needed to remove partially melted Ti6Al4V particles before further use. In addition, the depth of the porous structure of the SLM implant should not exceed the maximum depth of bone ingrowth because the host immune defense cannot prevent bacterial adhesion without integration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654610>Associations between the vaginal microbiome and Candida  in women of reproductive age.</a></h2><p>The composition of bacteria within the vaginal microbiome has garnered a lot of recent attention and has been associated with reproductive health and disease. Despite the common occurrence of yeast (primarily Candida) within the vaginal microbiome, there is still an incomplete picture of relationships between yeast and bacteria (especially lactobacilli), as well as how such associations are governed. Such relationships could be important to a more holistic understanding of the vaginal microbiome and its connection to reproductive health.To perform molecular characterization of clinical specimens to define associations between vaginal bacteria (especially Lactobacillus species) and Candida . In vitro studies were conducted to test the two most common dominant Lactobacillus species (Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners) in their ability to inhibit Candida growth and to examine the basis for such inhibition.A nested cross-sectional study of reproductive age women from the Contraceptive CHOICE Project was conducted. Vaginal swabs from 299 women were selected to balance race and BV status, resulting in similar representation of black and white women in each of the three Nugent score categories [normal (0-3), intermediate (4-6), and bacterial vaginosis (7-10)]. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal gene (V4 region) was used to determine the dominant Lactobacillus species present (primarily L. iners and L. crispatus), defined as >50% of the community. Subjects without dominance by a single Lactobacillus species were classified as Diverse. A Candida-specific qPCR targeting the internally transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) was validated using vaginal samples collected from a second cohort of women and used to assess Candida . 255 nonpregnant women with sufficient bacterial biomass for analysis were included in the final analysis. Generalized linear models were employed to evaluate associations between Lactobacillus dominance, sociodemographic and risk characteristics and vaginal Candida . In separate in vitro studies, the potential of cell-free supernatants from L. crispatus and L. iners cultures to inhibit Candida growth was evaluated.Forty-two women (16%) were vaginally colonized with Candida. Microbiomes characterized as Diverse (38%), L. iners-dominant (39%), and L. crispatus-dominant (20%) were the most common. The microbiome, race and Candida  co-varied with a higher prevalence of Candida among black women and L. iners-dominant communities compared to white women and L. crispatus-dominant communities. L. iners-dominant communities were more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities (OR = .85, 95% CI: 1.03 to 7.21; Fisher's Exact, p = 0.048). In vitro, L. crispatus produced greater concentrations of lactic acid and exhibited significantly more pH-dependent growth inhibition of C. albicans, suggesting a potential mechanism for the clinical observations.In nonpregnant women, L. iners-dominant communities were significantly more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities, suggesting that Lactobacillus species have different relationships with Candida. In vitro experiments indicate that L. crispatus may impede Candida  more effectively than L. iners through a greater production of lactic acid.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the transmission of CRE between humans and animals has not yet been well studied.We investigated the prevalence, risk factors, and drivers of CRE transmission between humans and their backyard animals in rural China.We conducted a comprehensive sampling strategy in 12 villages in Shandong, China. Using the household [residents and their backyard animals (farm and companion animals)] as a single surveillance unit, we assessed the prevalence of CRE at the household level and examined the factors associated with CRE carriage through a detailed questionnaire. Genetic relationships among human- and animal-derived CRE were assessed using whole-genome sequencing-based molecular methods.A total of 88 New Delhi -type carbapenem-resistant  (NDM-EC), including 17 from humans, 44 from pigs, 12 from chickens, 1 from cattle, and  from dogs, were isolated from 65 of the 746 households examined. The remaining 12 NDM-EC were from flies in the immediate backyard environment. The NDM-EC  in households was significantly associated with ) the number of species of backyard animals raised/kept in the same household, and ) the use of human and/or animal feces as fertilizer. Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) revealed that a large proportion of the core genomes of the NDM-EC belonged to strains from hosts other than their own, and several human isolates shared closely related core single-nucleotide polymorphisms and  genetic contexts with isolates from backyard animals.To our knowledge, we are the first to report evidence of direct transmission of NDM-EC between humans and animals. Given the rise of NDM-EC in community and hospital infections, combating NDM-EC transmission in backyard farm systems is needed. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5251.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517974>Model-based Assessment of the Effect of Contact Precautions Applied to Surveillance-detected Carriers of Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Long-term Acute Care Hospitals.</a></h2><p>An intervention that successfully reduced  and infection with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in Chicago-area long-term acute-care hospitals included active surveillance and contact precautions. However, the specific effects of contact precautions applied to surveillance-detected carriers on patient-to-patient transmission are unknown, as other, concurrent intervention components or changes in facility patient dynamics also could have affected the observed outcomes.Using previously published data from before and after the CPE intervention, we designed a mathematical model with an explicit representation of postintervention surveillance. We estimated preintervention to postintervention changes of 3 parameters: β, the baseline transmission rate excluding contact precaution effects; δb, the rate of a CPE carrier progressing to bacteremia; and δc, the progression rate to nonbacteremia clinical detection.Assuming that CPE carriers under contact precautions transmit carriage to other patients at half the rate of undetected carriers, the model produced no convincing evidence for a postintervention change in the baseline transmission rate β (+.1% [95% confidence interval {CI}, -18% to +28%]). The model did find evidence of a postintervention decrease for δb (-41% [95% CI, -60% to -18%]), but not for δc (-7% [95% CI, -28% to +19%]).Our results suggest that contact precautions for surveillance-detected CPE carriers could potentially explain the observed decrease in  by itself, even under conservative assumptions for the effectiveness of those precautions for reducing cross-transmission. Other intervention components such as daily chlorhexidine gluconate bathing of all patients and hand-hygiene education and adherence monitoring may have contributed primarily to reducing rates of colonized patients progressing to bacteremia.© The Author(s) 2019.

It is expected that the magnitude of this impact might depend on the species and the time since the disturbance occurs, nevertheless these assumptions remain mostly unexplored. Here we studied the genetic responses of the crustacean species Emerita analoga, Excirolana hirsuticauda, and Orchestoidea tuberculata to the 27F mega-earthquake/tsunami that occurred in Chile in February 2010. mtDNA sequence analyses revealed a lower haplotype diversity for E. analoga and E. hirsuticauda in impacted areas one month after the 27F, and the opposite for O. tuberculata. Three years after the 27F we observed a recovery in the genetic diversity of E. analoga and E. hirsuticauda and decrease in the genetic diversity in O. tuberculata in /3 of sampled areas. Emerita analoga displayed decrease of genetic differentiation and increase in gene flow explained by long-range population expansion.

This early stage soil is then colonized by microbes and vegetation in a process of primary succession. It is rarely experimentally examined whether this  process is linear or not at the ecosystem scale. Thus, to improve our understanding of the variables involved in the carbon accumulation in the different stages of primary succession, we conducted this research in three transects on the Matsch glacier forefield (Alps, N Italy) at an altitude between ,350 and ,800 m a.s.l.In three field campaigns (July, August and September 2014) a closed transparent chamber was used to quantify the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) between the natural vegetation and the atmosphere. On the five plots established in each of the three transects, shading nets were used to determine ecosystem response function to variable light conditions. Ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross ecosystem exchange (GEE) was partitioned from NEE. Following the final flux measurements, biometric sampling was conducted to establish soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content and the biomass components for each transect.A clear difference was found between the earlier and the later successional stage. The older successional stages in the lower altitudes acted as a stronger C sink, where NEE, GEE and Reco were significantly higher than in the earlier successional stage. Of the two lower transects, the sink capacity of intermediate-succession plots exceeded that of the plots of older formation, in spite of the more developed soil. Total biomass (above- and belowground) approached its maximum value in the intermediate ecosystem, whilst the later stage of succession predominated in the corresponding belowground organic mass (biomass, N and C).We found that the process of carbon accumulation along a glacier retreat chronosequence is not linear, and after a quite rapid increase in carbon accumulation capacity in the first 150 years, in average 9 g C m year, it slows down, taking place mainly in the belowground biomass components. Concurrently, the photosynthetic capacity peaks in the intermediate stage of ecosystem development. If confirmed by further studies on a larger scale, this study would provide evidence for a predominant effect of plant physiology over soil physical characteristics in the green-up phase after glacier retreat, which has to be taken into account in the creation of scenarios related to climate change and future land use.© 2019 Montagnani et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586658>Validity of surrogate endpoints assessing central venous catheter-related infection: evidence from individual- and study-level analyses.</a></h2><p>The prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) has been an area of intense research, but the heterogeneity of endpoints used to define catheter infection makes the interpretation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) problematic. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of different endpoints for central venous catheter infections.(a) Individual-catheter data were collected from 9428 catheters from four large RCTs; (b) study-level data from 70 RCTs were identified with a systematic search. Eligible studies were RCTs published between January 1987 and October 2018 investigating various interventions to reduce infections from short-term central venous catheters or short-term dialysis catheters. For each RCT the prevalence rates of CRBSI, quantitative catheter tip , catheter-associated infection (CAI) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) were extracted for each randomized study arm.CRBSI was used as the gold-standard endpoint, for which , CAI and CLABSI were evaluated as surrogate endpoints. Surrogate validity was assessed as (1) the individual partial coefficient of determination (individual-pR) using individual catheter data; () the coefficient of determination (study-R) from mixed-effect models regressing the therapeutic effect size of the surrogates on the effect size of CRBSI, using study-level data. showed poor agreement with CRBSI at the individual-patient level (pR = 0.33 95% CI 0.28-0.38) and poor capture at the study level (R = 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.58). CAI showed good agreement with CRBSI at the individual-patient level (pR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.83) and moderate capture at the study level (R = 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.85). CLABSI showed poor agreement with CRBSI at the individual patient level (pR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.23-0.46) and poor capture at the study level (R = 0.28, 95% CI 0.07-0.76).CAI is a moderate to good surrogate endpoint for CRBSI.  and CLABSI do not reliably reflect treatment effects on CRBSI and are consequently more suitable for surveillance than for clinical effectiveness research.Copyright © 2019 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

The effect of the polymerization of the structural units of POS contained in the AP hydrolysate on the growth and metabolism of microbiota from the human gastrointestinal tract and the adhesion of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) or pathogens to human gut epithelial cells was investigated in vitro. Mild acid hydrolysis followed by pectinolysis with Rohapect MaPlusT yielded the highest concentration of POS. In contrast, pure enzymatic processing of the AP performed with a mixed preparation of cellulase and Rohapect MaPlusT resulted in 1.8-fold lower overall POS. The concentration of higher-order oligosaccharides (degree of polymerization (DP) 7-10), however, was 1.7-fold higher. The increased ratio of higher-order oligosaccharides caused an increase in the bifidogenic effect, as well as affecting the amount and nature of short-chain fatty acid produced. Inhibition of  was also observed. The strongest stimulation of LAB adhesion to the human epithelial cells occurred in the presence of the preparation containing the highest concentration of higher-order oligosaccharides. The fecal bacteria and pathogens showed much weaker adhesion to intestinal cells in the presence of all the tested AP hydrolysates. Both of the tested POS preparations, containing structurally different oligosaccharides (DPs -10 with different ratios of higher-order oligosaccharides), have the potential to be used as prebiotics for humans and animals. They stimulate bowel  with lactic acid bacteria and inhibit the development of infections caused by pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546369>Shear-resistant hydrogels to control permeability of porous tubular scaffolds in vascular tissue engineering.</a></h2><p>Aiming to perfuse porous tubular scaffolds for vascular tissue engineering (VTE) with controlled flow rate, prevention of leakage through the scaffold lumen is required. A gel coating made of 8% w/v alginate and 6% w/v gelatin functionalized with fibronectin was produced using a custom-made bioreactor-based method. Different volumetric proportions of alginate and gelatin were tested (50/50, 70/30, and 90/10). Gel swelling and stability, and rheological, and uniaxial tensile tests reveal superior resistance to the aggressive biochemical microenvironment, and their ability to withstand physiological deformations (~10%) and wall shear stresses (5-20 dyne/cm). These are prerequisites to maintain the physiologic phenotypes of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (ECs), mimicking blood vessels microenvironment. Gels can induce ECs proliferation and , especially in the presence of fibronectin and higher percentages of gelatin. The custom-designed bioreactor enables the development of reproducible and homogeneous tubular gel coating. The permeability tests show the effectiveness of tubular scaffolds coated with 70/30 alginate/gelatin gel to occlude wadding pores, and therefore prevent leakages. The synthesized double-layered tubular scaffolds coated with alginate/gelatin gel and fibronectin represent both promising substrate for ECs and effective leakproof scaffolds, when subjected to pulsatile perfusion, for VTE applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Given that common plastics are derived from fossil fuels, one would expect that Plastispheres should be enriched with obligate hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (OHCB). So far, though, different polymer types do not seem to exert a strong effect on determining the composition of the Plastisphere, and putative biodegrading bacteria are only found as rare taxa within these biofilms. Here, we show through 16S rRNA gene sequencing that the enrichment of a prominent OHCB member on weathered and non-weathered polyethylene only occurred at early stages of  (i.e., after  days of incubation in coastal marine water; 5.8% and 3.7% of relative abundance, respectively, vs. 0.6% on glass controls). As biofilms matured, these bacteria decreased in relative abundance on all materials (< 0.3% after 9 days). Apart from OHCB, weathered polyethylene strongly enriched for other distinct organisms during early stages of , such as a specific member of the Roseobacter group and a member of the genus Aestuariibacter (median 26.9% and 1.8% of the community, respectively), possibly as a consequence of the availability of short-oxidized chains generated from weathering. Our results demonstrate that Plastispheres can vary in accordance with the weathering state of the material and that very early colonizing communities are enriched with taxa that can potentially degrade hydrocarbons. Given the lack of persistent enrichment and overall community convergence between materials over time, common non-hydrolysable polymers might not serve as an important source of carbon for mature Plastispheres once the labile substrates generated from weathering have been depleted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644908>Cutaneous Immune Cell-Microbiota Interactions Are Controlled by Epidermal JunB/AP-1.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a multi-factorial skin disease with a complex inflammatory signature including type  and type 17 activation. Although  by S. aureus is common in AD, the mechanisms rendering an organism prone to dysbiosis, and the role of IL-17A in the control of S. aureus-induced skin inflammation, are not well understood. Here, we show several pathological aspects of AD, including type /type 17 immune responses, elevated IgE, barrier dysfunction, pruritus, and importantly, spontaneous S. aureus  in JunB mice, with a large transcriptomic overlap with AD. Additionally, using Rag1 mice, we demonstrate that adaptive immune cells are necessary for protection against S. aureus . Prophylactic antibiotics, but not antibiotics after established dysbiosis, reduce IL-17A expression and skin inflammation, examined using Il17a-eGFP reporter mice. Mechanistically, keratinocytes lacking JunB exhibit higher MyD88 levels in vitro and in vivo, previously shown to regulate S. aureus . In conclusion, our data identify JunB as an upstream regulator of microbiota-immune cell interactions and characterize the IL-17A response upon spontaneous dysbiosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We used Environmental Niche Models to investigate the changes on the distribution of suitable climatic conditions for this species during the LIG (~120 ka), LGM (~21.5 ka) and Mid Holocene (~6 ka).We detected high genetic diversity across Y. schidigera populations (A = 9.94 ± 0.38 SE; H = 0.791 ± 0.011 SE) with genetic variation decreasing significantly with latitude (allelic richness: R =0.38, P =0.023; expected heterocigosity: R =0.32, P =0.042). We observed low, but significant genetic differentiation (F =0.0678; P < 0.001) which was consistent with the three genetic groupings detected by the Bayesian clustering algorithm (Structure). Geographic distance was significantly correlated with genetic differentiation among populations (r =0.38; P=0.004; partial Mantel test).

In infected mice, SAA proteins circulate in association with the vitamin A derivative retinol, suggesting that SAAs transport retinol during infection. Here we illuminate a structural basis for the retinol-SAA interaction. In the bloodstream of infected mice, most SAA is complexed with high-density lipoprotein (HDL). However, we found that the majority of the circulating retinol was associated with the small fraction of SAA proteins that circulate without binding to HDL, thus identifying free SAA as the predominant retinol-binding form in vivo. We then determined the crystal structure of retinol-bound mouse SAA3 at a resolution of . Å. Retinol-bound SAA3 formed a novel asymmetric trimeric assembly that was generated by the hydrophobic packing of the conserved amphipathic helices α1 and α3. This hydrophobic packing created a retinol-binding pocket in the center of the trimer, which was confirmed by mutagenesis studies. Together, these findings illuminate the molecular basis for retinol transport by SAA proteins during infection.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Interestingly, the species occurring in the northwestern Atlantic, , is more closely related to the Pontocaspian taxa,  and , than to the species occurring in the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. At least three  scenarios may account for this peculiar biogeographical pattern: (1) a recent human-mediated dispersal, () a historical transatlantic interchange, and (3) a historical transpolar interchange. To test these three scenarios, we used five operational criteria-time of species divergence, first appearance in the fossil record, dispersal limitation as well as environmental filtering and biotic interactions along the potential migration routes. Specifically, we inferred a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny for  and reconstructed a paleogeographical map of the Arctic Ocean at .5 million years ago (Mya). Based on the five operational criteria, scenarios 1 and  can likely be rejected. In contrast, all criteria support scenario 3 (historical transpolar interchange). It is therefore suggested that a bird-mediated and/or ocean current-mediated faunal interchange via the Arctic Ocean occurred during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene. This dispersal was likely facilitated by reduced distances between the Eurasian and North American/Greenland landmasses, marine introgressions, and/or a stepping-stone system of brackish-water habitats in northern Siberia, as well as a lack of competition along the migration route. As for the direction of dispersal, the scientific data presented are not conclusive. However, there is clearly more support for the scenario of dispersal from the Pontocaspian Basin to North America than vice versa.

In this study, (i) we focused on the anatomy of the fruitlets in the resistant "MD-" and susceptible "Queen" pineapple cultivars; (ii) we identified the key role of the carpel margin in the infection process; (iii) we identified the key role of the sinuous layer of thick-walled cells in the inhibition of  ; and (iv) we linked the anatomy of the fruitlets with the phenolic content of cell walls. The fruitlet anatomy of the two cultivars was studied using X-ray, fluorescence, and multiphoton microscopy. Sepals and bracts were not perfectly fused with each other, allowing the pathogen to penetrate the fruit even after flowering. In fact, the fungi were found in the blossom cups of both cultivars but only became pathogenic in the flesh of the "Queen" pineapple fruit under natural conditions. The outer layer of the "MD-" cavity was continuous with thick cell walls composed of ferulic and coumaric acids. The cell walls of the "Queen" blossom cup were less lignified at the extremities, and the outer layer was interspersed with cracks. The carpel margins were fused broadly in the "MD-" pineapple, in contrast to the "Queen" pineapple. This blemish allows the fungus to penetrate deeper into the susceptible cultivar. In pineapple fruitlets, the hyphae of  mainly progressed directly between cell walls into the parenchyma but never reached the vascular region. A layer of thick-walled cells, in the case of the resistant cultivar, stopped the , which were probably the infralocular septal nectaries. Anatomical and histochemical observations coupled with spectral analysis of the hypodermis suggested the role of lignin deposition in the resistance to .

This broad distribution is most likely a result of secondary introductions through the transport of contaminated vectors. Results also suggest the occurrence of multiple invasions, mainly in the northernmost sites. In summary, clonality, secondary introductions, and multiple invasions are the main reasons for the broad spread and invasive success of Tubastraea spp. in the Southwestern Atlantic. Consequently, the correct control of vectors is the most effective approach for management and prevention of new invasions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644315>Association between  Complex Pulmonary Disease and Mycobacteria in Home Water and Soil: A Case-Control Study.</a></h2><p>Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), including Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), are emerging pathogens that can opportunistically cause debilitating pulmonary disease in susceptible human hosts. Potential sources of exposure in homes include point-of-use water sources such as taps and showerheads, as well as gardening soils. The relative human health impacts of NTM in these home environments remain poorly understood.This study tested associations between MAC pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) and NTM  of five potential point-of-use sources of pathogen exposure in homes.A case-control study was conducted of Washington and Oregon residents who had been diagnosed with MAC-PD, and population controls matched by age, gender, and geography. Samples were collected from bathroom faucets, kitchen faucets, shower aerosols, indoor soil, and outdoor soil. Mycobacteria in environmental samples were identified in a blinded fashion by using bacteriological culture combined with PCR. The isolation of NTM from case homes (N = 56) vs. control homes (N = 51) was quantitatively compared using conditional logistic regression models with adjustment for potential confounding variables.NTM were isolated from shower aerosols collected in case homes more often than in control homes. An adjusted conditional logistic regression analysis showed that NTM isolation from shower aerosols had a high odds ratio associated with disease (OR, 4.0., 95% CI, 1.-13). Other home environmental samples (tap water, soils) did not exhibit this association.The results implicate shower aerosols as uniquely significant sources of NTM exposure in homes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604057>Identification and characterization of primordial germ cells in a vocal learning Neoaves species, the zebra finch.</a></h2><p>The zebra finch has been used as a valuable vocal learning animal model for human spoken language. It is representative of vocal learning songbirds specifically, which comprise half of all bird species, and of Neoaves broadly, which comprise 95% of all bird species. Although transgenesis in the zebra finch has been accomplished, it is with a very low efficiency of germ-line transmission and far from the efficiency with a more genetically tractable but vocal nonlearning species, the chicken (a Galloanseriformes). To improve germ-line transmission in the zebra finch, we identified and characterized its primordial germ cells (PGCs) and compared them with chicken. We found striking differences between the  species, including that zebra finch PGCs were more numerous, more widely distributed in early embryos before  into the gonads, had slower timing of , and had a different developmental gene-expression program. We improved conditions for isolating and culturing zebra finch PGCs  and were able to transfect them with gene-expression vectors and incorporate them into the gonads of host embryos. Our findings demonstrate important differences in the PGCs of the zebra finch and advance the first stage of creating PGC-mediated germ-line transgenics of a vocal learning species.-Jung, K.

Immune mediators were measured via Luminex multiplex assay. Women with vaginal Mycoplasmataceae were compared to women without Myc, and women with  species (MH or MG) were compared to women without MH or MG. Linear regression models were used to investigate the relationship of the presence of Mycoplasmataceae on log-transformed immune mediators while controlling for confounders using propensity scores.  One-hundred-twenty women were enrolled and had complete lab data available.  was 20.8, .5, 10.0, and 48.3% for MH, MG, UU, and UP, respectively. Women with any Mycoplasmataceae were more likely to be younger, of the Black race, and have public insurance. There were no significant differences in immune mediators between women with vaginal Mycoplasmataceae versus those without. After controlling for confounders, women with MH and/or MG had significantly elevated levels of IL-1β compared to women without MH or MG (estimate =  1.12; 95% CI =  0.33, 1.93). There were no other significant differences in immune mediators in women with MH and/or MG compared to those without.   rates were highest for UP and lowest for MG. Higher IL-1β levels were seen in the presence of MH and/or MG, indicating that these less frequently encountered organisms may incite a stronger host response.

Here, we examined the role of physical factors in non-random organ  using a zebrafish xenograft model. We observed a two-step process by which mammalian mammary tumor cells showed non-random organ . Initial homing was driven by vessel architecture, where greater numbers of cells became arrested in the topographically disordered blood vessels of the caudal vascular plexus (CVP) than in the linear vessels in the brain. Following arrest, bone-marrow- and brain-tropic clones exhibited organ-specific patterns of extravasation. Extravasation was mediated by β1 integrin, where knockdown of β1 integrin reduced extravasation in the CVP but did not affect extravasation of a brain-tropic clone in the brain. In contrast, silencing myosin 1B redirected early  from the brain to the CVP. Our results suggest that organ selectivity is driven by both vessel topography and cell-type-dependent extravasation.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641480>Environmental variables associated with  population structure and Swiss needle cast severity in Western Oregon and Washington.</a></h2><p>The environment has a strong influence on the abundance and distribution of plant pathogenic organisms and plays a major role in plant disease. Climatological factors may also alter the dynamics of the interactions between plant pathogens and their hosts.  (=) , the causal agent of Swiss needle cast (SNC) of Douglas-fir, is endemic to western North America where it exists as two sympatric, reproductively isolated lineages. The abundance of this fungus and the severity of SNC are strongly influenced by climate. We used statistical and population genetic analyses to examine relationships between environment, pathogen population structure, and SNC severity. Although  Lineage  in western Oregon and Washington was most abundant where SNC symptoms were most severe, we did not detect a significant relationship between Lineage  and disease severity. Warmer winter temperatures were inversely correlated with foliage retention () and positively correlated with the relative abundance of Lineage  (). However when distance inland, which was strongly correlated with both  and , was included in the model, there was no significant relationship between Lineage  and . Spring/early summer dew point temperatures also were positively associated with total  abundance ( index ()) and inversely correlated with . Warmer summer mean temperatures were associated with lower  and higher . Our results suggest that the two lineages have overlapping environmental optima, but slightly different tolerance ranges. Lineage  was absent from more inland sites where winters are colder and summers are warm and dry, while Lineage 1 occurred at most sites across an environmental gradient suggesting broader environmental tolerance. These relationships suggest that climate influences the abundance and distribution of this ecologically important plant pathogen and may have played a role in the evolutionary divergence of these two cryptic fungal lineages.© 2019 The Authors.

Dry cord care and alcohol 70% are commonly used in multiple developing countries. There is a need to investigate the efficacy and safety of both the cord care to achieve the best outcomes in neonates during this critical period of life. The objective of the study was to compare between dry cord care and topical application of alcohol 70% for cord care in newborn infants in terms of cord separation time (CST) as well as the incidence of omphalitis, sepsis, and neonatal mortality. The analysis was conducted up to April 2019 in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar to include randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and quasi-experiments which investigated at least two infant groups receiving either dry cord care or alcohol 70%. Mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to analyze continuous data, while risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were used to analyze dichotomous variables. A total of 13 articles were included (4967 infants, 50.35% females, six RCTs). Alcohol application was significantly associated with longer CST (MD = 1.93 days, 95% CI: 0.80, 3.06) with significant heterogeneity among studies (I= 97%) while no significant differences were found in the risk of omphalitis. On the other hand, dry cord care was associated with the risk of foul odor at the cord/surrounding tissues (RR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.85) and increased risk of E-coli  (RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.98). Dry cord care is a simple and effective way to shorten CST, particularly in countries with limited resources. However, in light of the limitations of the included studies, future RCTs with higher methodological quality are warranted. The significant heterogeneity among studies is the limitations of the included studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488199>Nasal  of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of a medically important Gram-positive bacteria, which can be harboured majorly in the nasal cavity.

This has resulted in a steady, nonasymptotic increase in diversity, with nearly 14% more species in connected fragments after almost two decades.

Phytohormones, root exudates, and volatiles are important factors regulating the host-AM fungi interaction. However, the effects of phytohormones, root exudates, and volatiles on asymbiotic (without roots present) or pre-symbiotic (with roots present but no ) sporulation of AM fungi are unexplored. In this study, we tested the asymbiotic sporulation of Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM 197198 and further investigated the influences of abscisic acid (ABA), the exudates, and volatiles of tomato hairy roots on asymbiotic or pre-symbiotic sporulation in vitro. Results indicated that mother spores asymbiotically and pre-symbiotically produced daughter spores singly or in pairs. Compared with symbiotically produced spores, pre-symbiotically produced spores were significantly smaller (43.1 μm vs. 89. μm in diameter). Exogenous ABA applied to mother spores significantly increased the number of daughter spores, and root volatiles also significantly promoted pre-symbiotic sporulation. Our results provide the first evidence that exogenous ABA can promote AM fungal asymbiotic and pre-symbiotic sporulation, which highlights the potential role of phytohormones in AM fungal propagation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532570>Characterization of a dehydratase and methyltransferase in the biosynthesis of a ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide in Lachnospiraceae.</a></h2><p>As a result of the exponential increase in genomic data, discovery of novel ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products (RiPPs) has progressed rapidly in the past decade.

In case of expectant management and with a low rate of antibiotic prophylaxis, home care compared to hospitalization could be associated with an increase in neonatal infections (LE3), especially in case of group B streptococcus  (LE3). Home care is therefore not recommended (Grade C). In the absence of spontaneous labor within 12 hours of rupture, antibiotic prophylaxis could reduce the risk of maternal intrauterine infection but not of neonatal infection (LE3). Its use after 12 hours of rupture in term prelabor rupture of the membranes is therefore recommended (Grade C). When antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated, intravenous beta-lactams are recommended (Grade C). Induction of labor with oxytocin (LE1), prostaglandin E2 (LE1) or misoprostol (LE1), is associated with shorter rupture of membranes to delivery intervals when compared to expectant management. Compared with expectant management, immediate induction of labor is not associated with lower rates of neonatal infection (LE1), even among women with a positive streptococcus B vaginal swab (LE2). Thus, expectant management can be offered without increasing the risk of neonatal infection (Grade B). Induction of labor is not associated with an increase or decrease in the cesarean delivery rate (LE2), whatever parity (LE2) or Bishop score at admission (LE3). Induction can thus be proposed without increasing the risk of cesarean delivery (Grade B). No induction method (oxytocin, dinoprostone, misoprostol or Foley Catheter) has demonstrated superiority over another, whether to reduce rate of intrauterine or neonatal infection, rate of cesarean delivery or to shorten rupture of membranes to delivery intervals regardless of Bishop's score and parity.Term prelabor rupture of membranes is a frequent event. A 12-hour delay without onset of spontaneous labor was chosen to differentiate a physiological condition from a potentially unsafe situation justifying an antibiotic prophylaxis. Expectant management or induction of labor can both be proposed, even in case of positive screening for streptococcus B, depending on the patient's wishes and maternity units' organization (Professional consensus).Copyright © 2019.

One of the main causes of apical periodontitis is extraradicular biofilm. In this study, we investigated polymicrobial biofilm formation by P. micra and species associated with apical periodontitis. The coaggregation activity of P. micra with partner strains was investigated by visual assays. Synergistic biofilm formation was evaluated by cocultures of P. micra and partner strains. Growth of planktonic cells was measured by evaluating the absorbance at OD, and biofilm formation was examined by staining with crystal violet. The effects of soluble components on synergistic biofilm formation and planktonic cell growth were examined after coculture of P. micra and other strains separated with a 0.4-μm pore-size porous membrane. P. micra coaggregated with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Capnoctyophaga ochracea. P. micra showed no coaggregation with Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, or Prevotella intermedia. In mixed cultures, biofilm formation by P. micra and F. nucleatum was greater than that by P. micra and P. gingivalis or C. ochracea. In separated cocultures, planktonic cell growth of P. micra was enhanced by each of the three species. Biofilm formation by P. micra was enhanced by F. nucleatum or C. ochracea; however, no significant enhancement was observed with P. gingivalis.

To date, there is no effective vaccine for swine. This prompted us to investigate the potential use of the commercially available vaccine for cattle or the live attenuated vaccine candidate S19Δ. As the first step, we sought to study the safety of the vaccine candidates when administered in pregnant sows, since one of the major drawbacks associated with vaccination using Live Attenuated Vaccines (LAV) is the induction of abortions when administered in pregnant animals. Fifteen pregnant gilts at mid-gestation were divided into four groups and subsequently vaccinated subcutaneously using different formulations containing .0 ± 0.508 × 10 CFU of either S19 or S19Δ. Vaccination in pregnant animals with the vaccine candidates did not induce abortion, stillbirths or a reduction in litter size. Multiple tissues in the gilts and piglets were examined at the time of delivery to assess bacterial  and histopathological changes. There was no evidence of vaccine persistence in the gilts or bacterial  in the fetuses. Altogether, these data suggest that both vaccine candidates are safe for use in pregnant swine. Analysis of the humoral responses, specifically anti- IgG levels measured in serum, demonstrated a robust response induced by either vaccine, but of shorter duration (4-6 weeks post-inoculation) compared to that observed in cattle or experimentally infected mice. Such a transient humoral response may prove to be beneficial in cases where the vaccine is used in eradication campaigns and in the differentiation of vaccinated from infected animals.

Here, we present an updated distribution of P. columella in Cuba; 68 positive sites with the earliest records more abundant in west-central Cuba and with east-central populations generally corresponding to the newest samples. No records were found farther east. The IPA site reported 10.5% prevalence of F. hepatica-infected snails. Population genetics, studied through microsatellites, showed low allelic and multilocus genotypic richness (MLGT), mainly in susceptible populations, strong deviations from panmixia and high self-fertilization rates. Susceptible individuals were grouped in one major cluster containing the majority of MLGT, and two independent clusters grouped the MLGT of resistant individuals from western and central populations, respectively. From these, we propose that several introductions of P. columella occurred in Cuba, primarily in the west, with the early arrivals deriving on the resistant populations. A more recent introduction of susceptible P. columella carrying MLGT T and Y may have occurred, where the latter spread quickly through the island and possibly increase the risk of parasite transmission in Cuba since all snails naturally infected with F. hepatica were carriers of the MLGT Y. Interestingly, even though resistant populations are highly diverse and are likely the oldest within Cuba, they are only found in six localities characterized by soft (total hardness, TH = 6.3 ± 1.03°d) and slightly acidic (pH = 6. ± 0.12) waters with low richness in snail species (3. ± 1.02). This tendency was also observed in a two-year follow-up ecological study that was conducted on a farm where both phenotypes occurred in sympatry;  events by resistant over susceptible snails coincided with a reduction in the pH and TH of the water. A comparison of life traits in susceptible and resistant isolates reared at two different pH/TH conditions (5.9/4°d or 7.8/14°d) showed that low pH/TH negatively affects P. columella, irrespective of the phenotype. However, evidence of higher tolerance (higher survival, life expectancy, egg viability) to such conditions was observed in resistant isolates. Finally, we speculate that the limited distribution of resistant populations might be related to a better exploitation of sites that are less suitable to snails (thus, with lower competition), rather than to a differential ecological restriction to specific environmental conditions from susceptible P. columella.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501027>Prevalence and molecular epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus nasal  in four nursing home residents in Crete, Greece.</a></h2><p>Nursing homes are considered as reservoirs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

While injection drug use is a risk factor for MRSA skin infections, MRSA is also known to transmit easily in crowded, public locations in which individuals have reduced personal hygiene. Individuals in urban centers who experience homelessness or drug addiction may spend significant amounts of time in environments where MRSA can be easily transmitted, and may also experience reduced access to facilities to maintain personal hygiene. We assessed the relationship between homelessness, personal hygiene, and MRSA nasal , a proxy for MRSA infection risk, in a study of PWID in Boston, MA (n = 78). Sleeping in a homeless shelter for at least one night in the last 3 months was significantly associated with MRSA nasal  (OR 3.0; p = 0.02; 95% CI 1., 7.6). Sleeping at more than one place during the last week (considered a metric of elevated housing instability) was also associated with a threefold increase in odds of MRSA nasal  (OR 3.1; p = 0.01; 95% CI 1.3, 7.6). MRSA nasal  was strongly associated with use of public showers (OR 13.7; p = 0.02; 95% CI 1.4, 132.8), although few people in this study (4 of 78) reported using these public facilities. Sharing bedding with other people was also associated with increased risk of MRSA  (OR .; p = 0.05; 95% CI 1.0-4.7). No associations between hand hygiene, frequency of bathing or clothes laundering, or street sleeping were observed. Use of public facilities supporting persons experiencing homelessness and housing instability, including shelters and public showers, is associated with an increased risk of MRSA nasal  in this study. Personal hygiene behaviors appear less associated with MRSA nasal . Environmental assessments of MRSA contamination in homeless shelters and public sanitation facilities are warranted so as to inform appropriate intervention activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601882>Microbial metabolite deoxycholic acid controls Clostridium perfringens-induced chicken necrotic enteritis through attenuating inflammatory cyclooxygenase signaling.</a></h2><p>Necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens infection has reemerged as a prevalent poultry disease worldwide due to reduced usage of prophylactic antibiotics under consumer preferences and regulatory pressures. The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into the relationship between NE pathogenesis, microbiome, and host responses. Here we showed that the microbial metabolic byproduct of secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA), at as low as 50 µM, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenges significantly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished (P < 0.05) by 1.5 g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and significantly reduced lamina propria cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into ileum (P < 0.05) without altering the bacterial ileal luminal . Molecular analysis showed that DCA significantly reduced inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, Il1β, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanism studies revealed that C. perfringens induced (P < 0.05) elevated expression of inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (Cyclooxygenases- (COX-) gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin significantly attenuated INFγ-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistent with the in vitro assay, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet protected the birds against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and intestinal cell apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through attenuating inflammatory response. These novel findings of microbiome protecting birds against NE provide new options on developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596574>Antimicrobial Peptide-Conjugated Hierarchical Antifouling Polymer Brushes for Functionalized Catheter Surfaces.</a></h2><p>Catheter-related infection is a great challenge to modern medicine, which causes significant economic burden and increases patient morbidity. Hence, there is a great requirement for functionalized surfaces with inherently antibacterial properties and biocompatibility that prevent bacterial  and attachment of blood cells. Herein, we developed a strategy for constructing polymer brushes with hierarchical architecture on polyurethane (PU) via surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). Surface-functionalized PU (PU-DMH) was readily prepared, which comprised of poly(3-[dimethyl-[-(-methylprop--enoyloxy)ethyl]azaniumyl]propane-1-sulfonate) (PDMAPS) brushes as the lower layer and antimicrobial peptide-conjugated poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) brushes as the upper layer. The PU-DMH surface showed excellent bactericidal property against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and could prevent accumulation of bacterial debris on surfaces. Simultaneously, the PU-DMH samples possessed good hemocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the integrated antifouling and bactericidal properties of PU-DMH under hydrodynamic conditions were confirmed by an in vitro circulating model. The functionalized surface possessed persistent antifouling and bactericidal performances both under static and hydrodynamic conditions. The microbiological and histological results of animal experiments also verified the in vivo anti-infection performance. The present work might find promising clinical applications for preventing catheter-related infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594808>Bacterial Swarming Reduces Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio parahaemolyticus Cell Stiffness and Increases β-Lactam Susceptibility.</a></h2><p>Swarmer cells of the Gram-negative uropathogenic bacteria  and  become long (>10 to 100 μm) and multinucleate during their growth and motility on polymer surfaces. We demonstrated that the increasing cell length is accompanied by a large increase in flexibility. Using a microfluidic assay to measure single-cell mechanics, we identified large differences in the swarmer cell stiffness (bending rigidity) of  (5.5 × 10 N m) and  (1.0 × 10 N m) compared to vegetative cells (1.4 × 10 N m and . × 10 N m, respectively). The reduction in bending rigidity (∼-fold to ∼26-fold) was accompanied by a decrease in the average polysaccharide strand length of the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall from 28 to 30 disaccharides to 19 to 22 disaccharides. Atomic force microscopy revealed a reduction in  peptidoglycan thickness from 1.5 nm (vegetative cells) to 1.0 nm (swarmer cells), and electron cryotomography indicated changes in swarmer cell wall morphology.  and  swarmer cells became increasingly sensitive to osmotic pressure and susceptible to cell wall-modifying antibiotics (compared to vegetative cells)-they were ∼30% more likely to die after 3 h of treatment with MICs of the β-lactams cephalexin and penicillin G. The adaptive cost of "swarming" was offset by the increase in cell susceptibility to physical and chemical changes in their environment, thereby suggesting the development of new chemotherapies for bacteria that leverage swarming for the  of hosts and for survival.  and  are bacteria that infect humans.

The aim of the study was to describe early HRCT findings according to a validated scoring system in infants with CF diagnosed by newborn screening (NBS).This cross-sectional study included infants with CF diagnosed by NBS who were born between January 2013 and January 2017 and who underwent HRCT scanning within the first year after diagnosis when they were clinically stable. The CT scans were evaluated using the modified Bhalla score.Thirty-two subjects underwent HRCT scanning. The mean total-modified Bhalla score was 3.6±.1, and 93.8% of the scans were abnormal. Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway  was associated with increased modified Bhalla score values. Bronchial wall thickening was the most common feature (90.6%), followed by bronchial collapse/consolidation (59.4%), mosaic attenuation/perfusion (50%), bronchiectasis (37.5%) and mucus plugging (15.6%). Bronchial wall thickening was diffuse in most of the patients.A substantial proportion of infants diagnosed with CF after detection by NBS already showed evidence of lung disease. P. aeruginosa  was associated with increased Bhalla scores, highlighting the importance of this CF pathogen in early structural lung disease. The presence of bronchial wall thickening at such a young age may reflect the presence of airway inflammatory processes. The detection and quantification of structural abnormalities with the modified Bhalla score may aid in the identification of lung disease before it is clinically apparent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511625>Liver sinusoidal endothelial cell ICAM-1 mediated tumor/endothelial crosstalk drives the development of liver metastasis by initiating inflammatory and angiogenic responses.</a></h2><p>The prometastatic stroma generated through tumor cells/host cells interaction is critical for metastatic growth. To elucidate the role of ICAM-1 on the crosstalk between tumor and primary liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), implicated in tumor adhesion and angiogenesis, we performed in vitro cocultures and an in vivo model of liver metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). ICAM-1 blockade in the LSECs decreased the adhesion and transmigration of tumor cells through an LSEC in vitro and vivo. Cocultures of C26 cells and LSECs contained higher amounts of IL-1β, IL-6, PGE-, TNF-α and ICAM-1 than monocultures. C26 cells incubated with sICAM-1 secreted higher amounts of PGE-, IL-6, VEGF, and MMPs, while enhanced the migration of LSECs and HSCs. HSCs cultures activated by media from C26 cells pretreated with sICAM-1 contained the largest amounts of VEGF and MMPs. C26 cell activation with sICAM-1 enhanced their metastasizing potential in vivo, while tumor LFA-1 blockade reduced tumor burden and LSECs and HSC-derived myofibroblasts recruitment. In vivo ICAM-1 silencing produced similar results. These findings uncover LSEC ICAM-1 as a mediator of the CRC metastatic cascade in the liver and identifies it as target for the inhibition of liver  and metastatic progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617171>Vaccines for Herpes Simplex: Recent Progress Driven by Viral and Adjuvant Immunology.</a></h2><p>Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) types 1 and  are ubiquitous. They both cause genital herpes, occasionally severe disease in the immunocompromised, and facilitate much HIV acquisition globally. Despite more than 60 years of research, there is no licensed prophylactic HSV vaccine and some doubt as to whether this can be achieved. Nevertheless, a previous HSV vaccine candidate did have partial success in preventing genital herpes and HSV acquisition and another immunotherapeutic candidate reduced viral shedding and recurrent lesions, inspiring further research. However, the entry pathway of HSV into the anogenital mucosa and the subsequent cascade of immune responses need further elucidation so that these responses could be mimicked or improved by a vaccine, to prevent viral entry and  of the neuronal ganglia. For an effective novel vaccine against genital herpes the choice of antigen and adjuvant may be critical. The incorporation of adjuvants of the vaccine candidates in the past, may account for their partial efficacy. It is likely that they can be improved by understanding the mechanisms of immune responses elicited by different adjuvants and comparing these to natural immune responses. Here we review the history of vaccines for HSV, those in development and compare them to successful vaccines for chicken pox or herpes zoster. We also review what is known of the natural immune control of herpes lesions, via interacting innate immunity and CD4 and CD8 T cells and the lessons they provide for development of new, more effective vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31442462>Analysis of  and infections during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in children.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571725>Protective efficacy of a  vaccine using a -based delivery system expressing  Omp3b, BCSP31, and SOD proteins against brucellosis in Korean black goats.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to assess the protective efficacy of a novel  vaccine formulation in goats.

Sweet sorghum ( (L.) Moench) is considered a promising alternative feedstock for bioalcohol production because of its sugar-rich stalk and high biomass. However, little is known of AMF benefit for biomass production and salt tolerance of sweet sorghum. Here, we investigated the effects of   ZZ on growth and salt tolerance in two sweet sorghum cultivars (Liaotian5 and Yajin2) under different NaCl addition levels (0, 0.5, 1, , and 3 g NaCl/kg soil). Results showed AMF colonized the two cultivars well under all NaCl addition levels. NaCl addition increased mycorrhizal  rates in Yajin2, but the effects on Liaotian5 ranged from stimulatory at 0.5 and 1 g/kg to insignificant at  g/kg, and even inhibitory at 3 g/kg. High NaCl addition levels produced negative effects on both AM and non-AM plants, leading to lower biomass production, poorer mineral nutrition (N, P, K), higher Na uptake, and lower soluble sugar content in leaves. Compared with non-AM plants, AM plants of both cultivars had improved plant biomass and mineral uptake, as well as higher K/Na ratio, but only Yajin2 plants had a low shoot/root Na ratio. AM inoculation increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), and soluble sugar content in leaves. Overall, both cultivars benefited from mycorrhization, and Yajin2 with less salt tolerance showed higher mycorrhizal response. In conclusion, AMF could help to alleviate the negative effects caused by salinity, and thus showed potential in biomass production of sweet sorghum in saline soil.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464711>Class-switched Primary Cutaneous Marginal Zone Lymphomas Are Frequently IgG4-positive and Have Features Distinct From IgM-positive Cases.</a></h2><p>Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) can be subdivided into  groups based on immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain usage: IgM-positive cases that constitute a less common and more T-helper type 1-driven process, and more common heavy chain class-switched cases that are predominantly T-helper type -driven. Although some report a significant IgG4-positive subset, others have found a much smaller proportion. To further evaluate the proportion of IgG4-positive PCMZL, to address whether IgG4-positive cases have any distinctive characteristics, and to assess whether additional features separating IgM-positive and class-switched cases could be identified, the clinicopathologic features of 26 PCMZL obtained from 19 patients were investigated. Twenty of 26 (77%) PCMZL were heavy chain class-switched (19 IgG-positive, 1 IgA-positive), including 9 that were IgG4-positive (35%). IgG4-positive and other class-switched PCMZL were morphologically similar. IgM-positive cases occurred in older individuals (median: 69 vs. 46.5 y; P=0.0001), more often involved the subcutis (P=0.002), demonstrated plasma cells diffusely scattered versus at the periphery of the lymphoid infiltrate (P=0.005), uniformly showed follicular  (P=0.0001), contained more numerous B cells (P=0.0004), and were more likely to have a T-cell CD4:CD8 ratio of <3:1 (P=0.03). None of the IgM-positive PCMZL harbored a MYD88 L265P mutation. No significant differences in clinical outcome were documented. These results highlight the high frequency of IgG4-positive PCMZL, which are otherwise similar to other class-switched cases, provide additional evidence supporting the distinction between class-switched and IgM-positive cases, and emphasize the indolent nature of at least the class-switched PCMZL, which may warrant their categorization as a clonal chronic lymphoproliferative disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584632>Laxative use does not preclude diagnosis or reduce disease severity in Clostridiodes difficile infection.</a></h2><p>To optimize utility of laboratory testing for Clostridiodes difficile infection (CDI), the 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America-Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (IDSA-SHEA) clinical practice guidelines recommend excluding patients from stool testing for C. difficile if they have received laxatives within the preceding 48 hours. Sparse data support this recommendation.Patients with new-onset diarrhea (≥3 bowel movements in any 24 hour period in the 48 hours before stool collection) and a positive stool C. difficile nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) were enrolled.

The location of the abscess can be within the myocardium, endocardium, or valves (native, prosthetic or mechanical). Infective endocarditis is an infection of the heart valves, which if not promptly treated, can progress to a cardiac abscess in 20 to 30% of cases.[1]  An abscess anywhere in the myocardium can present as an interventricular abscess in rare cases. The interventricular septum is a thick, muscular wall that separates the ventricles. However, the proximal portion of the septum is thin and membranous, and the distal part is thick and muscular. The proximity of interventricular septum to the valves makes it highly vulnerable to developing an abscess.[][3] An interventricular abscess usually occurs as an extension of infective endocarditis from cardiac valves, most commonly aortic valve endocarditis. [4] Due to the progression of endocarditis into a paravalvular abscess, it can present as conduction blocks, and/or congestive heart failure. Even with optimal treatment, the inpatient mortality of aortic valve endocarditis has been reported as high as 40% to 79%, depending on patient age, comorbidity, and the type of organism.[5]  There are several risk factors for developing infective endocarditis. These include rheumatic, congenital, and degenerative valve lesions, intracardiac prosthetic devices, intravenous drug use, and use of access devices (e.g., indwelling catheters, hemodialysis, pacemakers, etc.).[6] Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of infective endocarditis. Data from greater than 70 million hospitalizations in the United States from 1999 to 2008 suggest an increase in the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus rate of infection relative to other microorganisms.

Yet, the O fugacity at the sediment-water interface (SWI) for the earliest animal proliferation is poorly defined. The preferential  of seafloor as a first step in animal evolution is also unusual. In order to understand the environmental background, we employed a new proxy, carbonate associated ferrous iron (Fe), to quantify the seafloor oxygenation. Fe of the latest Ediacaran Shibantan limestone in South China, which yields abundant animal traces, ranges from .27 to 85.43 ppm, corresponding to the seafloor O fugacity of 162 μmol/L to 297 μmol/L. These values are significantly higher than the oxygen saturation in seawater at the contemporary atmospheric pO levels. The highly oxygenated seafloor might be attributed to O production of the microbial mats. Despite the moderate atmospheric pO level, microbial mats possibly provided highly oxygenated niches for the evolution of benthic metazoans. Our model suggests that the O barrier could be locally overcome in the mat ground, questioning the long-held belief that atmospheric oxygenation was the key control of animal evolution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515249>Skin  by circulating neoplastic clones in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a mature T-cell lymphoma currently thought to develop primarily in the skin by a clonal expansion of a transformed, resident memory T-cell. However, this concept does not explain the key characteristics of MF such as the debut with multiple, widespread skin lesions or inability of skin directed therapies to provide cure. The testable inference of the mature T-cell theory is the clonality of MF with respect to all rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) genes. Here we have used whole exome sequencing approach to detect and quantify TCRα, -β and -γ clonotypes in tumor cell clusters microdissected from MF lesions. This method allows us to calculate the tumor cell fraction of the sample and therefore an unequivocal identification of the TCR clonotypes as neoplastic. Analysis of TCR sequences from 29 patients with MF stage I-IV proved existence of multiple T-cell clones within the tumor cell fraction, with a considerable variation between patients and between lesions from the same patient (median 11 clones, range -80 clones/sample). We have also detected multiple neoplastic clones in the peripheral blood in all examined patients. Based on these findings we propose that circulating neoplastic T-cell clones continuously replenish the lesions of MF thus increasing their heterogeneity by a mechanism analogous to the consecutive tumor seeding. We hypothesize that circulating neoplastic clones might be a promising target for therapy and could be exploited as a potential biomarker in MF.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Hematology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521311>Biofunctional catheter coatings based on chitosan-fatty acids derivatives.</a></h2><p>Multifunctional and biofunctional coatings for medical devices are an attractive strategy towards tailoring the interactions of the device with the body, thereby influencing the host response, and the susceptibility to microbial . Here we describe the development of a coating process to yield amphiphilic, lubricious coatings, resistant to bacterial , based on chitosan. Chitosan-fatty acid derivatives were obtained by simultaneous N,O-acylation of chitosan with either linoleic, α-linolenic, or dilinoleic acid. Chemical characterization of new materials was carried out using H NMR, FTIR, and XPS. Surface properties of coated polyester samples were studied using SEM and contact angle measurements, which indicated that the incorporation of hydrophobic constituents into chitosan macromolecules led to a decrease of both surface roughness and water contact angle. Importantly, tribological testing demonstrated that these new coatings decrease the coefficient of friction due to the self-organization of fatty acid (from 0.53 for the neat chitosan to 0.35 for chitosan-fatty acid derivative). Meanwhile, preliminary bacterial  tests indicated significant-over 80%-reduction in E. coli  following coating with chitosan-linoleic and chitosan-α-linolenic derivatives. Finally, cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility studies confirmed that all amphiphilic chitosan-fatty acid derivatives were non-toxic and non-hemolytic. Collectively, our results demonstrate the potential of the developed coating strategy, particularly the chitosan-linoleic and chitosan-α-linolenic acid derivatives, for applications as biofunctional catheter coatings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This work presents a scientific solution to overcome this problem by immobilizing RuBisCO into a microfluidic reactor, which demonstrates a continuous production of glucose precursor at 13.8 μmol g RuBisCO min from CO and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Experiments show that the RuBisCO immobilization significantly enhances enzyme stabilities (7. folds in storage stability, 6.7 folds in thermal stability), and also improves the reusability (90.4% activity retained after 5 cycles of reuse and 78.5% after 10 cycles). This work mimics the NPS pathway with scalable microreactors for continuous synthesis of glucose precursor using very small amount of RuBisCO. Although still far from industrial production, this work demonstrates artificial synthesis of basic food materials by replicating the light-independent reactions of NPS, which may hold the key to food crisis relief and future space .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509886>Ancient wheat varieties have a higher ability to interact with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria.</a></h2><p>Plant interactions with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are highly dependent on plant genotype. Modern plant breeding has largely sought to improve crop performance but with little focus on the optimization of plant × PGPR interactions. The interactions of the model PGPR strain Pseudomonas kilonensis F113 were therefore compared in 199 ancient and modern wheat genotypes. A reporter system, in which F113  and expression of ,4-diacetylphloroglucinol biosynthetic genes (phl) were measured on roots was used to quantify F113 × wheat interactions under gnotobiotic conditions. Thereafter, eight wheat accessions that differed in their ability to interact with F113 were inoculated with F113 and grown in greenhouse in the absence or presence of stress. F113  was linked to improved stress tolerance. Moreover, F113  and phl expression were higher overall on ancient genotypes than modern genotypes. F113  improved wheat performance in the four genotypes that showed the highest level of phl expression compared with the four genotypes in which phl expression was lowest. Taken together, these data suggest that recent wheat breeding strategies have had a negative impact on the ability of the plants to interact with PGPR.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567795>MRSA Carrier Rate in Orthopaedic Trauma Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>To identify the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carrier rate among surgical patients on an orthopaedic trauma service and to determine if screening is an effective tool for reducing post-operative MRSA infection in this population.Prospective SETTING:: Level 1 trauma centerPatients/Participants: 248 patients with operatively managed orthopaedic trauma conditions during the study period. 203 patients (82%) had acute orthopaedic trauma injuries. 45 patients (18%) underwent surgery for a non-acute orthopaedic trauma condition, including 36 elective procedures and 9 procedures to address infection.MRSA screening protocol, pre-operative antibiotics per protocol MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS:: MRSA carrier rate, overall infection rate, MRSA infection rate RESULTS:: Our screening captured 71% (175/248) of operatively treated orthopaedic trauma patients during the study period. The overall MRSA carrier rate was 3.4% (6/175). When separated by group, the acute orthopaedic trauma cohort had an MRSA carrier rate of 1.4% (/143), and neither MRSA-positive patient developed a surgical site infection (SSI). Only one MRSA infection occurred in the acute orthopaedic trauma cohort. The non-acute group had a significantly higher MRSA carrier rate of 12.5% (4/32, p=0.01), and the elective group had the highest MRSA carrier rate of 15.4% (4/26, p<0.01). The odds ratio of MRSA  was 10.1 in the non-acute group (95% CI 1.87, 75.) and 12.8 for true elective group (95% CI .36, 96.5) when compared to the acute orthopaedic trauma cohort.There was a low MRSA  rate (1.4%) among patients presenting to our institution for acute fracture care. Patients undergoing elective surgery for fracture-related conditions such as nonunion, malunion, revision surgery, or implant removal have a significantly higher MRSA carrier rate (15.4%) and therefore may benefit from MRSA screening. Our results do not support routine vancomycin administration for orthopaedic trauma patients whose MRSA status is not known at the time of surgery.Prognostic Level I.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516805>Prevalence and characteristics of methicillin-resistant   among healthcare professionals in a university hospital in Japan.</a></h2><p>Asymptomatic carriers of methicillin-resistant  (MRSA) are important sources of nosocomial transmission.

Elaborate Ca regulatory networks have been well characterized in eukaryotic cells, where Ca regulates a number of essential cellular processes, ranging from cell division, transport and motility, to apoptosis and pathogenesis. However, in bacteria, the knowledge on Ca signaling is still fragmentary. This is complicated by the large variability of environments that bacteria inhabit with diverse levels of Ca. Yet another complication arises when bacterial pathogens invade a host and become exposed to different levels of Ca that (1) are tightly regulated by the host, () control host defenses including immune responses to bacterial infections, and (3) become impaired during diseases. The invading pathogens evolved to recognize and respond to the host Ca, triggering the molecular mechanisms of adhesion, biofilm formation, host cellular damage, and host-defense resistance, processes enabling the development of persistent infections. In this review, we discuss: (1) Ca as a determinant of a host environment for invading bacterial pathogens, () the role of Ca in regulating main events of host  and bacterial virulence, and (3) the molecular mechanisms of Ca signaling in bacterial pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579233>Study of vancomycin and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant Enterococcus species and evaluation of a rapid spot test for enterococci from Central Referral Hospital, Sikkim, India.</a></h2><p>Enterococcus is an important pathogen, and with its emergence of resistance to multiple antimicrobials, the management of infection is becoming increasingly difficult.The aim of the study is to determine the prevalence, antibiotic resistance, and risk factors associated with enterococcal infection or .In this prospective study, samples from inpatients were screened for resistant enterococci.

While it is known that > 80% of pig farmers are colonized with LA-MRSA, only few studies assessed the situation for humans with occasional livestock contact. Recently it was shown that over 75% of scientific field workers visiting pigsties were temporarily carrying LA-MRSA.To find out whether they were transiently or permanently colonized, we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) data to analyze the relatedness of isolates from these recurrently LA-MRSA-positive field workers and from corresponding pigsties. Sequences were analyzed using  typing (, cgMLST) and the BEAST software package was used to examine phylogeny.In total, 81 samples from three field workers on eight different pigsties over a period of .5 years were sequenced. All isolates belonged to  types t011, t034 or t2011 with different types found in the same field worker at different time points. Analysis of cgMLST revealed nine genotypic clusters, mostly correlating with the pigsty on which they were sampled. Field worker isolates clustered with the samples from farms that were visited on the same day. BEAST analysis corroborated the cgMLST-based clustering and suggests an origin of the lineage about 22 years ago.We conclude that nasal LA-MRSA  among humans with occasional livestock contact is common but most likely only temporary. Furthermore, we showed that the Western German LA-MRSA CC398 originated in the late 1990s and diversified into farm-specific genotypes, which stay relatively consistent over time.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662046>. in Loggerhead Sea Turtles (): From  to Infection.</a></h2><p>With the aim of evaluating the presence of . in sea turtles with and without lesions and assessing the risk factors favoring  and/or infection, 74 loggerhead sea turtles () admitted to rescue and rehabilitation clinics in Italy were analyzed.

Here, we describe the formation of carbohydrate functionalized glass surfaces with D-glucose, D-galactose and D-mannose and how they efficiently affected the bacterial attachment. The carbohydrate entities were covalently attached to the pre-functionalized surface by click chemistry thanks the copper catalysed alkyl-azide cycloaddition. Water contact angle and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterisations showed a homogeneous and quantitative cycloaddition at the scale of microorganisms. The adhesion assays with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, used as model of opportunistic pathogen, indicated a significant diminution of almost 40% of the bacterial accumulation on glycosidic surfaces with respect to initial surface. This activity was further compared with a surface presenting a simple hydroxyl residue. Exploration of specific interactions through Lectin A deficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutant strain provided new evidences that Lectin A was involved in biofilm maturation, rather than bacterial attachment. Subsequently, the determination of surface free energy and the adhesion free energy between surfaces and bacterial cell wall showed that the adhesion was thermodynamically unfavourable.Copyright © 2019.

To prevent maternal GBS vaginal , new antibiotic-free approaches, based on lactobacilli probiotics, are advisable. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-GBS activity of 14 vaginal Lactobacillus strains, belonging to different species (L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. vaginalis), isolated from healthy pre-menopausal women. In particular, we performed 'inhibition' experiments, evaluating the ability of both Lactobacillus cells and culture supernatants in reducing Streptococcus viability, after 60 min contact time. First, we demonstrated that the acidic milieu, produced by vaginal lactobacilli metabolism, is crucial in counteracting GBS growth in a pH-dependent manner. Experiments with organic/inorganic acid solutions confirmed the strict correlation between pH levels and the anti-GBS activity. GBS was more sensitive to lactic acid than to hydrochloric acid, indicating that the presence of H ions is necessary but not sufficient for the inhibitory activity. Moreover, experiments with Lactobacillus pH-adjusted supernatants led to exclude a direct role in the anti-GBS activity by other bioactive molecules. Second, we found that only a few Lactobacillus strains were able to reduce Streptococcus viability by means of cell pellets. The anti-GBS effect displayed by Lactobacillus cells was related to the their ability to interact and aggregate with Streptococcus cells. We found that the anti-GBS activity was retained after methanol/proteinase K treatment, but lost after lysozyme exposure of Lactobacillus cells. Therefore, we supposed that non-proteinaceous components of Lactobacillus cell wall could be responsible for the anti-GBS activity. In conclusion, we identified specific Lactobacillus strains able to interfere with GBS viability by multiple strategies and we elucidated some of the mechanisms of action. These strains could serve as probiotic formulations for the prevention of GBS vaginal .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently introduced pathogens initially induce resistance responses, but natural selection favors the development of tolerance, allowing for a commensal relationship to evolve. Mycosis by Pseudogymnoascus destructans, causing white-nose syndrome (WNS) in Nearctic hibernating bats, has resulted in population declines since 2006. The pathogen, which spread from Europe, has infected species of Palearctic Myotis for a longer period. We compared ecologically relevant responses to the fungal infection in the susceptible Nearctic M. lucifugus and less susceptible Palearctic M. myotis, to uncover factors contributing to survival differences in the two species. Samples were collected from euthermic bats during arousal from hibernation, a naturally occurring phenomenon, during which transcriptional responses are activated. We compared the whole-transcriptome responses in wild bats infected with P. destructans hibernating in their natural habitat. Our results show dramatically different local transcriptional responses to the pathogen between uninfected and infected samples from the two species. Whereas we found 1526 significantly upregulated or downregulated transcripts in infected M. lucifugus, only one transcript was downregulated in M. myotis. The upregulated response pathways in M. lucifugus include immune cell activation and migration, and inflammatory pathways, indicative of an unsuccessful attempt to resist the infection. In contrast, M. myotis appears to tolerate P. destructans infection by not activating a transcriptional response. These host-microbe interactions determine pathology, contributing to WNS susceptibility, or commensalism, promoting tolerance to fungal  during hibernation that favors survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585477>Management and Prevention of Central Venous Catheter-Related Infections in the ICU.</a></h2><p>Central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) are a frequent event in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. In contrast to other nosocomial infections, most risk factors for CR-BSI are linked to the device and can be prevented efficiently. Rates of CR-BSI higher than 1 per 1,000 catheter days are no longer acceptable. A continuous quality improvement program is effective to reduce them. Key elements of prevention of CR-BSI are hand hygiene, avoidance of insertion of unnecessary catheters, full sterile barrier precautions at insertion, preferential use of subclavian venous insertion site, cutaneous antisepsis with % chlorhexidine alcoholic preparation, use of chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings, immediate replacement of moistened or detached catheter dressings, and removal of catheters as soon as possible. Audit and feedback of the process of care, infection rates, and periodic re-education of health care providers are other instrumental tools in the prevention of CR-BSI. Catheter removal is the main therapeutic intervention, especially recommended in the case of sepsis or shock. While awaiting culture results, an empiric antimicrobial treatment of CR-BSI should target gram-positive microorganism (, ) and gram-negative coverage should be based on clinical variables, patients' risk factors, and previous  status. While a short course of antimicrobials (7 days) is sufficient for noncomplicated CR-BSI, a longer course of 14 days should be preferred for uncomplicated  and  CR-BSI. In case of persisting fever or positive blood culture after 3 days despite adequate antimicrobial therapy and catheter removal, catheter-related complications (e.g., endocarditis, thrombophlebitis, septic metastasis) should be ruled out.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651305>Comparing methods to estimate incremental inpatient costs and length of stay due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Alberta, Canada.</a></h2><p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an opportunistic bacterial organism resistant to first line antibiotics. Acquisition of MRSA is often classified as either healthcare-associated or community-acquired. It has been shown that both healthcare-associated and community-acquired infections contribute to the spread of MRSA within healthcare facilities. The objective of this study was to estimate the incremental inpatient cost and length of stay for individuals colonized or infected with MRSA. Common analytical methods were compared to ensure the quality of the estimate generated. This study was performed at Alberta Ministry of Health (Edmonton, Alberta), with access to clinical MRSA data collected at two Edmonton hospitals, and ministerial administrative data holdings.A retrospective cohort study of patients with MRSA was identified using a provincial infection prevention and control database. A coarsened exact matching algorithm, and two regression models (semilogarithmic ordinary least squares model and log linked generalized linear model) were evaluated. A MRSA-free cohort from the same facilities and care units was identified for the matched method; all records were used for the regression models. Records span from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2015, for individuals 18 or older at discharge.Of the models evaluated, the generalized linear model was found to perform the best. Based on this model, the incremental inpatient costs associated with hospital-acquired cases were the most costly at $31,686 (14,169 - 60,158) and $47,016 (23,125 - 86,332) for  and infection, respectively. Community-acquired MRSA cases also represent a significant burden, with incremental inpatient costs of $7397 (2924 - 13,180) and $14,847 (8445 - 23,207) for  and infection, respectively. All costs are adjusted to 2016 Canadian dollars. Incremental length of stay followed a similar pattern, where hospital-acquired infections had the longest incremental stays of 35.

The dense mucus together with biofilm formation limit drug permeability and prevent the drug from reaching the site of action, causing treatment failure of the bacterial infection. Besides the use of antibiotics, the mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is recommended to be co-administered in the treatment of CF. Although several formulations have been developed for inhalation therapy to improve the pulmonary condition in CF patients, there is still no comprehensive study on a combined multifunctional dry powder formulation of antibiotics with NAC. In this work, we developed an innovative multifunctional dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation based on salt formation between NAC and antibiotics and characterized their solid state properties and physical stability. NAC could be spray dried together with three different antibiotics, azithromycin (Azi), tobramycin (Tobra) and ciprofloxacin (Cipro), without the use of organic solvents to form Azi/NAC, Tobra/NAC and Cipro/NAC DPI formulations. Solid-state characterization of these DPI formulations showed that they were amorphous after spray drying. Azi/NAC and Tobra/NAC form co-amorphous salt systems that were physically stable under storage at stress conditions. For particle characterization, the obtained mass median aerodynamic diameters were in a suitable range for inhalation (< 5.0μm). The multifunctional antibiotic/NAC formulations conserved or improved the antibiotic susceptibility and showed promising results regarding the inhibition of P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm formation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It plays roles in various processes, including cell adhesion, migration, growth, proliferation, and tissue repair. Fibronectin exists in  forms: a soluble, inactive molecule, called plasma FN (pFN), which is synthesized by hepatocytes in the liver, and an insoluble cellular form (cFN), which is produced locally by different types of cells and is a key component of the ECM. Fibrinogen fibrils ensure structural support for cell adhesion and promote cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis. Additionally, FN controls the availability of growth factors. The plasma form of FN is a crucial component of the fibrin clot in the early wound-healing response, while the cellular form of FN supports efficient platelet adhesion, activation, aggregation, and procoagulant activity. Alternative splicing of the FN gene results in the generation of protein variants which contain the additional isoforms - extra domain A of FN (EDA) and extra domain A of FN (EDB); these are associated with, e.g., tissue remodeling, fibroblast differentiation, inflammation, and tumor progression. Fibronectin also serves as a target for a large number of bacterial proteins, and as part of a 3-component bridge (FN, integrin and FN-binding proteins - FnBPs) it contributes to bacterial  of endothelial and epithelial cells. Fibronectin has been identified in sepsis in humans as a negative acute-phase protein, and a low level of FN seems to be a marker of a poor prognosis for a patient.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens []. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root microbiota, including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative -keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates  by beneficial root microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, the hydrophilic sugars are anchored to a lipid phosphate carrier (undecaprenyl phosphate (C55-P)), yielding membrane intermediates which are translocated to the outer face of the membrane. Finally, the glycan moiety is transferred to a nascent acceptor polymer, releasing the carrier in the "inactive" undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (C55-PP) form. Thus, C55-P is generated through the dephosphorylation of C55-PP, itself arising from either de novo synthesis or recycling. Two types of integral membrane C55-PP phosphatases were described: BacA enzymes and a sub-group of PAP2 enzymes (type  phosphatidic acid phosphatases). The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori does not contain BacA homologue but has four membrane PAP2 proteins: LpxE, LpxF, HP0350 and HP0851. Here, we report the physiological role of HP0851, renamed HupA, via multiple and complementary approaches ranging from a detailed biochemical characterization to the assessment of its effect on cell envelope metabolism and microbe-host interactions. HupA displays a dual function as being the main C55-PP pyrophosphatase (UppP) and phosphatidylglycerol phosphate phosphatase (PGPase). Although not essential in vitro, HupA was essential in vivo for stomach . In vitro, the remaining UppP activity was carried out by LpxE in addition to its lipid A 1-phosphate phosphatase activity.

These interactions take place in a highly complex chemical landscape, the intestinal eco-active chemosphere, composed of chemical substances that positively or negatively influence bacterial growth, including those originated from nutrient uptake, and those produced by the action of the human or animal host and the intestinal microbiome. The contribution of bacteria results from their effect on the host generated molecules, on food and digested food, and organic substances from microbial origin, including from bacterial degradation. Here, we comprehensively review the main chemical substances present in the human intestinal chemosphere, particularly of those having inhibitory effects on microorganisms. With this background, and focusing on , the most relevant human pathogens from the intestinal microbiota, the microcin's history and classification, mechanisms of action, and mechanisms involved in microcin's immunity (in microcin producers) and resistance (non-producers) are reviewed. Products from the chemosphere likely modulate the ecological effects of microcin activity. Several cross-resistance mechanisms are shared by microcins, colicins, bacteriophages, and some conventional antibiotics, which are expected to produce cross-effects. Double-microcin-producing strains (such as microcins MccM and MccH47) have been successfully used for decades in the control of pathogenic gut organisms. Microcins are associated with successful gut , facilitating translocation and invasion, leading to bacteremia, and urinary tract infections. In fact,  strains from the more invasive phylogroups (e.g., B2) are frequently microcinogenic.

This multi-center, randomized, open-label, prospective phase 1 study compared the safety and local tolerability of two nasal formulations of XF-73, a novel porphyrinic antibacterial drug with rapid intrinsic activity against SA.The study was conducted in  dosing cohorts, and enrolled 60 healthy adults. In Part 1, 8 non-SA carriers were randomized to  groups of 4 subjects in each arm and were treated with the new formulations of XF-73 in concentrations of 0.5 mg/g % gel and  mg/g % gel, respectively. In Part , 52 healthy persistent SA carriers were randomized to 4 groups of 13 subjects in each arm and were treated with three different concentrations of XF-73 (0.5 mg/g % gel,  mg/g % gel and 0.5 mg/g 4% gel) or a 4% viscosified placebo gel, respectively. Plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) studies were performed. Anti-staphylococcal activity was assessed as the presence or absence of SA and by quantification of the level of  using a semi-quantitative scale (SA score).56 subjects (8/8 from Part 1 and 48/52 from Part ) completed the study, with 47/60 comprising the PK population and 48/60 the PD population. There was no measurable systemic absorption of XF-73 from nasal application. Treatment with XF-73 was associated with a rapid diminution in the SA scores in all subjects. The most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) reported were rhinorrhea and nasal dryness (15.5% each in Part 1 and Part ). TEAEs were mostly mild and resolved spontaneously.XF-73 was found to be safe and was tolerated with minimal side effects at doses of 0.5 mg/g % gel and  mg/g % gel in healthy volunteers. These findings support moving on to Phase  trials to further evaluate the efficacy of XF-73.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to assess the bacterial  and study the MCR-1 (mobilized colistin resistance), VIM2 (β-lactam resistance), TET(K) (tetracycline resistance) and bla (carbapenem resistance) genes' expression in isolated facultative anaerobes at 3 time points in oral mucositis patients undergoing radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy.A total of 24 oral cancer patients were divided into  groups: A (N = 12) undergoing radiotherapy; and B (N = 12) undergoing radiochemotherapy. Saliva was collected from all patients at 3 time intervals during the treatment. The isolated bacterial colonies were subjected to gene expression and analysis.Staphylococcus aureus (22%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (29%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28%), Escherichia coli (25%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (26%) are the facultative anaerobes isolated from saliva.

Due to the sensitivity issue of screening schemes for A. baumannii, it is difficult to implement adequate transmission prevention measures. The high discriminatory power of WGS for transmission-chain analysis provides us with the necessary tool to study and identify transmission events. We retrospectively sequenced and analysed 39 A. baumannii isolates from 2012-15 to search for possible missed transmission events.Molecular typing by WGS was performed for non-repetitive (n = 39) carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Retrospective assessment of patient records was performed to investigate and confirm possible transmission events.Between July 2012 and September 2015, A. baumannii was isolated from 268 patients, of which 16% (42/268) were carbapenem resistant. Thirty-nine of these isolates were recoverable and sequenced. Fifteen percent (6/39) of these were resistant to all antibiotics tested. Most isolates belong to the circulating IC2 clonal type. SNP analysis revealed four potential outbreak clusters. Two of these clusters showed high concordance with the local spatio-temporal epidemiology, suggesting that transmission events were very likely.Our data suggest that there were two independent transmission events, which would have been missed by conventional MLST owing to high clonality. The routine implementation of WGS can optimize surveillance and initiation of suitable containment measures. In addition, emerging resistance to salvage therapy is a major therapeutic problem and should be monitored closely.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, life-threatening infections (eg, necrotizing pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, and osteomyelitis) caused by PVL-SA have also been reported.We assessed the clinical phenotype, frequency, clinical implications (surgery, length of treatment in hospitals/intensive care units, and antibiotic treatments), and potential preventability of severe PVL-SA infections in children.Total, 75 children treated for PVL-SA infections in our in- and outpatient units from 2012 to 2017 were included in this retrospective study.Ten out of 75 children contracted severe infections (PVL-methicillin resistant S aureus n = 4) including necrotizing pneumonia (n = 4), necrotizing fasciitis (n = ), pyomyositis (n = ; including 1 patient who also had pneumonia), mastoiditis with cerebellitis (n = 1), preorbital cellulitis (n = 1), and recurrent deep furunculosis in an immunosuppressed patient (n = 1). Specific complications of PVL-SA infections were venous thrombosis (n = ), sepsis (n = 5), respiratory failure (n = 5), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 3). The median duration of hospital stay was 14 days (range 5-52 days). In 6 out of 10 patients a history suggestive for PVL-SA  in the patient or close family members before hospital admission was identified.PVL-SA causes severe to life-threatening infections requiring lengthy treatments in hospital in a substantial percentage of symptomatic PVL-SA colonized children.

This study, therefore, aimed to assess the nasal and hand carriage of Staphylococcus aureus among food handlers in Jimma Town.A community based cross sectional study was conducted from February to May 2017. Swab specimens from nasopharyngeal and hands of food handlers working in food establishments were collected for isolation and identification of S. aureus using standard bacteriological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was done using disc diffusion method. Associations of selected variables for S. aureus  were determined using SPSS version 20 with p ≤ 0.05 taken as statistically significant.Among the 300 food handlers working in hotels and restaurants in Jimma Town, 86(28.7%) were colonized by S. aureus. The frequency of isolation of S. aureus from nose, hand and both parts (nose and hand) were 27(9%), 34(11.3%) and 25(8.3%), respectively. There was strong association (P=0.00336) between carriage rate of S. aureus and food handlers' job category. The majority (90.7%) of the isolates were resistant to Penicillin and Ampicillin. Increased levels of sensitivity were observed against Ciprofloxacin (96.5%), Cefoxitin (95.3%) and Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid (94.%).This study revealed a high prevalence of S. aureus carriers among food handlers and high antibacterial resistance towards commonly prescribed drugs, justifying the screening of food handlers to detect and treat carriers and protect restaurant customers from staphylococcal food poisoning.© 2019 Getenet Beyene, et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503161>Antibiotic Use Without Indication During Delivery Hospitalizations in the United States.</a></h2><p>To analyze trends in unindicated antibiotic use during vaginal delivery hospitalization.This study used an administrative database to analyze antibiotic use during delivery hospitalizations from January 2006 to March 2015. Women were classified by mode of delivery and whether they had an evidence-based indication for antibiotics. Indications for antibiotics included preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM), cesarean delivery, group B streptococcus (GBS) , chorioamnionitis, endometritis, urinary tract infections, and other infections. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess trends of antibiotic administration. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses for antibiotic receipt including demographic, hospital, and obstetric and medical factors were performed with unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs as measures of association.A total of 5,536,756 delivery hospitalizations, including ,872,286 vaginal deliveries without an indication for antibiotics, were analyzed. The most common indication for antibiotics was cesarean delivery (33.6% of the entire cohort), followed by GBS  (15.8%), chorioamnionitis (1.7%), preterm PROM (1.6%), endometritis (1.%), urinary tract infections (0.6%), and other infections (total less than 0.5%).

Infants who are being treated in intensive care units are often colonized by Candida species. However, little is known regarding commensal yeast  of healthy infants and young children. Here the acquisition of yeast species was studied in a birth-cohort including 133 healthy Swedish infants. A rectal swab sample was obtained on day 3 of life, and fresh fecal samples were obtained at regular intervals up to 3 years of age; the samples were cultured quantitatively for yeasts.  with yeasts increased rapidly in the first months of life, with 73/133 infants (55%) colonized at 6 months of age. The yeast numbers in positive samples decreased from an average of 105 cfu/g in infants aged 0- months to 103.5 cfu/g at 3 years of age. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species and reached higher population counts than the other species in culture-positive infants. The yeast  rate did not differ between infants who were delivered vaginally and those birthed via Caesarean section, whereas breastfed infants showed a lower  rate (p < 0.05 for 1 year of age compared to the other infants). The results demonstrate that yeasts, particularly C. albicans and C. parapsilosis (sensu lato), are common commensals in the gut microbiota of healthy infants and young children.© The Author(s) 2019.

The threat of infection by intractable enterococci and the possibility that vancomycin resistance could involve pneumococci or staphylococci advocate for careful surveillance of resistant strains.To determine the risk factors associated with VRE  in pediatric patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in the period between January 2012 and June 2013.We conducted a cross-sectional study analyzing the clinical histories of 140 patients admitted to the PICU (children from 1 month to 18 years) who underwent rectal swab cultures within 48 hours of admission. We calculated the odds ratios and confidence intervals of the risk factors for VRE  in the PICU, and then we used multiple logistic regression for the statistically significant variables.VRE  was present in 18.6% of patients. The following variables were identified as risk factors associated with VRE : prior hospitalization in the past year (odds ratio: 10.8; 95% confidence interval: .43 to 47.8; p = 0.001); prior use of one broad-spectrum antibiotic (odds ratio: 5.05; 95% confidence interval: .04 to 12.5; p = 0.000); use of two or more broad-spectrum antibiotics in past year (odds ratio: 5.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 18.4; p = 0.009); prior hospitalization in a high-risk area (odds ratio: 4.91; 95% confidence interval: 1.83 to 13.; p = 0.000); hospitalization for more than five days in a high-risk area (odds ratio: 5.64; 95% confidence interval: .18 to 14.6; p = 0.000); and use of immunosuppressant drugs (odds ratio: 4.84; 95% confidence interval: 1.92 to 11.9; p = 0.001).

It also enlightens our understanding on the host-microbe interactions within the physiological context of a living host. However, the responses of GF zebrafish to various  conditions such as bacterial concentrations,  time points, and exposure duration remain unclear. To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations,  time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or 5 dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate,  efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate immunity, stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or 5 dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for 5 dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and immunity, while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to immunity and stress responses. Moreover, our data revealed that GF zebrafish showed higher levels of physical activity than CONR and the microbial  reduced the hyperactivity of GF zebrafish, suggesting  of bacteria affected behavior characteristics.

Rhodopseudomonas palustris strain GJ-22 is known as a phyllosphere biocontrol agent. In this paper, we described detailed processes of strain GJ-22 colony establishment at various  stages. Four different types of bacterial colonies, Type 1, scattered single cells; Type , small cell clusters; Type 3, small cell aggregates; and Type 4, large cell aggregates, were observed in the course of bacterial . We categorized bacterial  into four phases, which were, Phase I: bacterial colony exists as Type 1 and cell population reduced quickly; Phase II: Type 1 evolved into Type  and cell population remained steady; Phase III: Type 3 arose and replaced Type , and cell population expanded slowly; and Phase IV: Type 3 matured into Type 4 and cell population increased quickly. We have shown that the preferable location sites of bacterial aggregates on leaf phyllosphere are grooves between plant epidermal cells. Analyses of expressions of plant defence-related genes showed that, starting from Phase III, bacterial cells in the Type 3 and Type 4 colonies produced unidentified signals to induce host defence against Tobacco mosaic virus infection. In addition, we determined the crucial role of aggregates formation of GJ-22 cell on plant phyllosphere in terms of bacterial cell stress tolerance and ISR (induced systemic resistance) priming. To our knowledge, this is the first report focused on the  process of a phyllosphere biocontrol agent and gave a clear description on the morphological shift of bacterial colony on phyllosphere.© 2019 The Authors.

The influence of starvation-associated stress on the behavior of non-toxin-producing strains of  serotype O157:H7 and serotypes O26, O103, O111, and O145 was examined subsequent to their introduction to the phyllosphere of field-grown romaine lettuce as inocula simulating starved (96 h in sterile deionized water) and nutrient-depleted (24 h broth culture) cells. As with  O157:H7, leaf populations of the non-O157 strains declined rapidly during the first 72 h postinoculation, displaying the biphasic decay curve typical of serotype O157:H7 isolates. Preinoculation treatment appeared not to influence decay rates greatly ( > 0.5), but strain-specific differences (persistence period and attachment proficiency) indicated that serotype O103:H2 strain PARC445 was a better survivor. Also assessed was the impact of preinoculation treatment on phenotypes key to leaf  and survival and the expression of starvation stress-associated genes. The 96-h starvation period enhanced biofilm formation in one strain but reduced motility and autoinducer  formation in all five study strains relative to those characteristics in stationary-phase cells. Transcription of  and  was reduced significantly ( < 0.05) in starvation-stressed cells relative to that for exponential- and stationary-phase cultures.

Yet, whether mycorrhizae affect traits important to pollination remains poorly understood and may depend on the match between host and fungal genotypes. Here, we examined how ericoid mycorrhizal fungi affected flowering phenology, floral traits, and reproductive success, among eight genotypes of highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum (Ericaceae). We asked three overarching questions: (1) Do genotypes differ in response to inoculation? () How does inoculation affect floral and flowering traits? (3) Are inoculated plants more attractive to pollinators and less pollen limited than non-inoculated plants of the same genotype?To examine these questions, we experimentally inoculated plants with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, grew the plants in the field, and measured flowering and floral traits over  years. In year , we conducted a hand-pollination experiment to test whether plants differed in pollen limitation.Inoculated plants had significantly higher levels of  for some genotypes, and there were significant floral trait changes in inoculated plants for some genotypes as well. On average, inoculated plants produced significantly larger floral displays, more fruits per inflorescence, and heavier fruits with lower sugar content, than non-inoculated, control plants. Hand pollination enhanced the production of fruits, and fruit mass, for non-inoculated plants but not for those that were inoculated.Our results demonstrate that inoculation with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi enhanced flowering and altered investment in reproduction in genotype-specific ways. These findings underscore the importance of examining belowground symbionts and genotype-specific responses in their hosts to fully understand the drivers of aboveground interactions.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and () patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial  was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

This concern is more among the vulnerable group. We determined the prevalence and associated risk factors of MRSA nasal carriage among children in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria.We conducted a hospital-based, cross-sectional study among 300 children attending the outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital recruited through systematic sampling technique. An interviewer-administered, structured questionnaire was used to obtain sociodemographic characteristics and exposure factors. Nasal swabs samples were collected and inoculated on mannitol salt agar and subcultured on nutrient agar to isolate Staphylococcus aureus. We used the conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique to detect the presence of mecA gene for MRSA. We calculated the prevalence, prevalence odds ratio to determine risk factors for MRSA acquisition at 5% level of significance.The median age was 1.7 years (6 months-16 years). Males accounted for 60.7%, and 75% of the participants were under 5 years. Staphylococcus aureus  was found in 36.3% of the participants while 5.3% of the participants had MRSA identified by detecting the mecA gene. History of recent surgery in the last six months was the only independent predictor of nasal MRSA  among the participants (aOR=12.5; 95%CI: .7-50.0.).The high prevalence of MRSA  observed among the children in this study suggests the need to consider screening children with history of previous surgery as infection control and prevention intervention for MRSA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525614>Impaired development of a miltefosine-resistant Leishmania infantum strain in the sand fly vectors Phlebotomus perniciosus and Lutzomyia longipalpis.</a></h2><p>To gain insight into the propagation of miltefosine (MIL) resistance in visceral leishmaniasis, this laboratory study explored development of resistant parasites with a defective miltefosine transporter (MT) in sand flies.Infectivity,  of stomodeal valve and metacyclogenesis of a MIL-resistant (MIL-R) Leishmania infantum LEM3323 line with a defective MT were assessed in the natural sand fly vectors Phlebotomus perniciosus and Lutzomyia longipalpis. Given our recent description of partial drug dependency of the MT-deficient line, the impact of MIL pre-exposure on sand fly infectivity was explored as well.A significant reduction in sand fly infection, stomodeal valve  and differentiation into metacyclics (determined by a lower flagellum/cell body length ratio) was observed in both vectors for MIL-R as compared to the isogenic parent MIL-susceptible line. Re-introduction of the wildtype MT gene into MIL-R tended to partially rescue the capacity to infect sand flies. Pre-exposure to MIL did not alter infectivity of the MIL-R line.The MIL resistant L. infantum LEM3323 line is significantly hampered in its development and transmissibility potential in two sand fly vector species. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate whether this applies to other visceral Leishmania parasites with acquired MIL-resistance.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

However, damage to soil structure and the natural increase in soil strength with depth, often impedes root penetration. Evidence suggests that roots use macropores (soil cavities greater than 75 μm) to bypass strong soil layers. If roots have to exploit structures, a key trait conferring deep rooting will be the ability to locate existing pore networks; a trait called trematotropism. In this study, artificial macropores were created in repacked soil columns at bulk densities of 1.6 g cm and 1. g cm , representing compact and loose soil. Near isogenic lines of wheat, Rht-B1a and Rht-B1c, were planted and root-macropore interactions were visualized and quantified using X-ray computed tomography. In compact soil, 68.8% of root-macropore interactions resulted in pore , compared with 12.5% in loose soil. Changes in root growth trajectory following pore interaction were also quantified, with 21.0% of roots changing direction (±3°) in loose soil compared with 76.0% in compact soil. These results indicate that  of macropores is an important strategy of wheat roots in compacted subsoil. Management practices to reduce subsoil compaction and encourage macropore formation could offer significant advantage in helping wheat roots penetrate deeper into subsoil.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557296>Administration of dietary prebiotics improves growth performance and reduces pathogen  in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Dietary prebiotics are thought to be potentially important alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters in poultry production because of their beneficial performance and health effects. The administration of dietary prebiotics has been demonstrated to improve animal health, growth performance, and microbial food safety in poultry production. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Saccharomyces-derived prebiotic refined functional carbohydrates (RFC) with yeast culture on growth performance and gastrointestinal and environmental microbiota when administered in-feed and through drinking water to broiler chickens. Broilers were administered  doses of prebiotic in-feed through 42 d of production and prebiotic-treated water in the final 72 h. Administration of prebiotic RFC improved ADG and decreased cecal Campylobacter counts, while the high dose also increased final BW. Additionally, significant main effects of prebiotic RFC dose were observed with the high dose improving ADG and ADFI over the finisher phase and final BW. Although the effects were not significant, the prevalence of Campylobacter in the cecum after feed withdrawal was 17% lower when broilers were administered the high prebiotic dose, and recovery of Campylobacter from litter was up to 50% lower when broilers were administered prebiotic RFC. Our results suggest that co-administration of RFC with yeast culture as a prebiotic can be used to improve growth performance and reduce human foodborne pathogens in poultry.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615960>Probiotic Yeasts Inhibit Virulence of Non Species.</a></h2><p>Systemic infections of  species pose a significant threat to public health.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of AM fungi isolated from naturally occurring Al acidic soils in conferring host tolerance to Al toxicity in 3 wheat cultivars differing in Al sensitivity. The experiment was conducted in a soil-less substrate (vermiculite/perlite, :1, v/v) using two Al -tolerant genotypes and one Al -sensitive wheat genotype. The wheat was colonized with a consortium of AM fungi isolated from an andisol, with or without Al at a concentration of 200 μM.The wheat response to Al in the medium was dependent on both the plant genotype and AM . The benefits of the AM fungi to the wheat cultivars included an increased P concentration and relatively low Al accumulation in the plants. This was achieved through two mechanisms. First, the metal chelating capacity of the AM fungi was clear in some cultivars ('Tukan' and 'Porfiado'), in which the enhanced extraradical mycelium development was able to retain Al in the glomalin and hyphae.

By investigating the spread of an aquatic invader in patchy habitats, we quantified genetic drift and explored its consequences for genetic diversity and fitness. We examined the interplay of gene flow and genetic drift in 36 populations of the red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, in a relatively recently invaded wetland area (30 years, Brière, northwest France). Despite the small spatial scale of our study (15 km ), populations were highly structured according to the strong barrier of land surfaces and revealed a clear pattern of  through watercourses. Isolated populations exhibited small effective sizes and low dispersal rates that depended on water connectivity, suggesting that genetic drift dominated in the evolution of allele frequencies in these populations. We also observed a significant decrease in the genetic diversity of isolated populations over only a -year period, but failed to demonstrate an associated fitness cost using fluctuating asymmetry. This study documents the possible strong influence of genetic drift during the spread of a species, and such findings provide critical insights into the current context of profound rearrangements in species distributions due to global change.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535924>Evaluation of the combined effect of  and  on soybean yield in naturally-infested fields with spatial regression analysis and in greenhouse studies.</a></h2><p>, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), and , causal agent of charcoal rot, are economically important soybean pathogens.

Diseases in childhood and later in life are potentially mediated by the perturbation of the  of the infant gut microbiota. However, the effects of delivery via caesarean section on the earliest stages of the acquisition and development of the gut microbiota, during the neonatal period (≤1 month), remain controversial. Here we report the disrupted transmission of maternal Bacteroides strains, and high-level  by opportunistic pathogens associated with the hospital environment (including Enterococcus, Enterobacter and Klebsiella species), in babies delivered by caesarean section. These effects were also seen, to a lesser extent, in vaginally delivered babies whose mothers underwent antibiotic prophylaxis and in babies who were not breastfed during the neonatal period. We applied longitudinal sampling and whole-genome shotgun metagenomic analysis to 1,679 gut microbiota samples (taken at several time points during the neonatal period, and in infancy) from 596 full-term babies born in UK hospitals; for a subset of these babies, we collected additional matched samples from mothers (175 mothers paired with 178 babies).

Over-expression or knockdown of MSLN has been implicated in PDAC aggressiveness. This activity has been ascribed to MSLN-induced activation of MAPK or NF-κB signaling pathways and to interaction of MSLN with its only known binding partner, MUC16. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to delete MSLN from PDAC, then restored expression of wild-type (WT) or Y318A mutant MSLN by viral transduction. We found that MSLN KO cells grew in culture and as subcutaneous tumors in mouse xenografts at the same rate as WT cells but formed intraperitoneal (IP) metastases poorly. Complementation with WT MSLN restored IP growth, while complementation with Y318A mutant MSLN, which does not bind MUC16, was ineffective at enhancing growth in both MUC16(+) and MUC16(-) models. Restoration of WT MSLN did enhance growth but did not affect cell-to-cell binding, cell viability in suspension or signaling pathways previously identified as contributing to the pro-tumorigenic effect of MSLN. RNA deep sequencing of tumor cells identified no changes in transcriptional profile that could explain the observed phenotype. Further, no histologic changes in tumor cell proliferation or morphology were observed in mature tumors. Examination of nascent MSLN KO tumors revealed decreased microvascular density as IP tumors were forming, followed by decreased proliferation, which resolved by  weeks post-implantation. These data support a model whereby MSLN expression by tumor cells contributes to metastatic . Implications: MSLN confers a growth advantage to tumor cells during  of peritoneal metastasis.

To gain additional insights, five types of PD (polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyurethane) were exposed for three-time periods (two weeks, four weeks, and six weeks) in the Haihe Estuary. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to identify the bacterial communities on PD, in seawater, and in sediment samples. The results indicate that the average growth rate of a biofilm is affected by nutrients (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) and salinity. Furthermore, salinity is the primary factor affecting bacterial diversity of the colonies on PD. In addition, genera of bacteria show selectivity toward the PD polymer type and tend to colonize their preferred substrate.

In an effort to evaluate the origin and evolution of PV pathogenicity, we collected paired oral, perianal, and genital swabs from a wild macaque population. Of the 117 surveyed macaques, 88 (75.%) were positive for PV DNA in one or more sites, mostly common from genital swabs, followed by oral and perianal sites. All putative macaque PV types phylogenetically clustered into the genera -, -, and , with a strong phylogeny-tropism association as observed in HPVs. Using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework, we demonstrated ancient intra-host divergence of primate PVs in which multiple ancestors had split and adapted to specific host ecosystems at least 41 million years ago, prior to the speciation events of primate host species. Following subsequent divergence and niche adaptation, distinct but phylogenetically related PV types were transmitted to similar host ecosystems by closely related host animals when host speciation occurred, which may explain in part the origin of carcinogenicity of HPV type 16 (HPV16) and  PV type 3 (MfPV3) that evolved from a most recent common ancestor containing the determinants for cervicovaginal  and cervical cancer. The findings identifying evolutionary and biological relatedness between human and non-human primate PVs lay a genetic foundation for research on parasite-host interactions and carcinogenic outcomes, which will prove useful in further study of viral pathogenesis and host specificity.To better understand the origin and evolution of PV carcinogenicity associated with cervical cancer, we applied a combination of phylogenetic and bioinformatic analyses to investigate the genetic diversity of macaque papillomaviruses, and estimate divergence times of human and non-human primate PVs. The majority of both human and non-human primate PVs cluster into α-, β-, and γ-PVs, sharing similar evolutionary histories and biological properties to each other.

Subsequent clinical cultures within 7 days of the nares swab were evaluated for presence of MRSA. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs), and NPVs were calculated for the entire cohort, as well as subgroups for specific culture sites.This cohort yielded 561,325 clinical cultures from a variety of anatomical sites. The sensitivity and specificity for positive MRSA clinical culture were 67.4% and 81.%, respectively. The NPV of MRSA nares screening for ruling out MRSA infection was 96.5%.

However, whether there is a synergistic effect between AMF and PSA in promoting plant growth and controlling disease is worth exploring. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of AMF and PSA on growth-promotion and controlling disease on Solanaceae vegetables and to obtain effective AMF+PSA combinations. Under greenhouse pot conditions, chili (Capsicum annu-um, cultivar: Yangjiaojiao) and eggplant (Solanum melongena, cultivar: Heiguanchangqie) were inoculated with or without AMF Funneliformis mosseae (Fm), Glomus versiforme (Gv), PSA Streptomyces globosus H6-1, Streptomyces rochei S2-, Streptomyces coralus D11-4 or/and pathogenic fungi Botrytis cinerea. There were a total of 48 treatments. The growth, disease and root symbiont development of plants were determined. The results showed that Fm and PSA could promote each other's , while Gv and PSA inhibited each other. Compared with the control, AMF, PSA and AMF+PSA improved the photosynthetic performance, root activity, and growth of chili and eggplant. Under the condition of inoculation with pathogenic fungi, AMF and/or PSA treatment significantly increased growth and reduced the disease index of plants, with the effects of PSA being greater than that of AMF. Fm+H6-1 combination had the best effect on the growth-promotion and controlling disease of chili plants, with the controlling effect on gray mold reaching 69.1%. Fm+ D11-4 had the best effect on the growth promotion and controlling disease of eggplant, the controlling effect of which on gray mold reached 75.5%. Fm+H6-1 andFm+D11-4 were efficient combinations of chili and eggplant for promoting growth and controlling disease under the conditions of this experiment.

In this study, we proposed a two-step cultivation process, which comprised of a " step" and a "mass cultivation step," and examined its efficacy in both bucket-scale and flask-scale cultivation experiments. We showed that in the outdoor bucket-scale experiments using three kinds of environmental water, plants cultured through the two-step cultivation method with the PGPB strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus P23, yielded 1.9 to .3 times more biomass than the control (without PGPB inoculation). The greater nitrogen and phosphorus removals compared to control were also attained, indicating that this strategy is useful for accelerating nutrient removal by duckweed. Flask-scale experiments using non-sterile pond water revealed that inoculation of strain P23 altered duckweed surface microbial community structures, and the beneficial effects of the inoculated strain P23 could last for 5-10 d. The loss of the duckweed growth-promoting effect was noticeable when the  of strain P23 decreased in the plant. These observations suggest that the stable  of the plant with PGPB is the key for maintaining the accelerated duckweed growth and nutrient removal in this cultivation method. Overall, our results suggest the possibility of an improved duckweed production using a two-step cultivation process with PGPB.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

They significantly improve the patients' comfort and quality of life, but also constitute a significant risk factor for biofilm-associated infections. Currently, intensive research on the development of novel materials resistant to microbial  as well as new compounds that are active against biofilms is being carried out. Within this research, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and their analogues are being intensively investigated due to their promising antimicrobial activities. The main goal of this study was to synthesize and evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of short cationic lipopeptides that were designed to imitate the features of AMPs responsible for antimicrobial activities: positive net charge and amphipacity. The positive charge of the molecules results from the presence of basic amino acid residues: arginine and lysine. Amphipacity is provided by the introduction of decanoic, dodecanoic, tetradecanoic, and hexadecanoic acid chains to the molecules. Lipopeptides (C-KR-NH, C-KKK-NH, C-KKC-NH, C-KGK-NH, C-KR-NH, C-KKC-NH, C-KR-NH, C-KKC-NH, and (C)-KKKK-NH) were synthesized using a novel solid-phase temperature-assisted methodology. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs), and minimum biofilm formation inhibitory concentrations (MBFICs) were determined for the following bacterial strains:  ATCC 25923,  ATCC 14990,  ATCC 29212,  ATCC 25922,  ATCC 9027, and  PCM 543. The biofilms were cultured on two types of surfaces: polystyrene plates (PS) and contact lenses (CL). The lipopeptides exhibited the ability to inhibit the growth of bacteria in a liquid medium as well as on the PS and CL. The compounds also eliminated the bacterial biofilm from the surface of both materials. In general, the activity against gram-positive bacteria was stronger in comparison to that against gram-negative strains. There were certain discrepancies between the activity of compounds against the biofilm cultured on PS and CL. This was especially noticeable for staphylococci-the lipopeptides presented much higher activity against biofilm formed on the PS surface. It is worth noting that the obtained MBEC values for lipopeptides were usually only a few times higher than the MICs. The results of the performed experiments suggest that further studies on lipopeptides and their potential application in the treatment and prophylaxis of biofilm-associated infections should be conducted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644974>Covalent grafting of titanium with a cathelicidin peptide produces an osteoblast compatible surface with antistaphylococcal activity.</a></h2><p>Bacterial infection of orthopaedic implants, often caused by Staphylococcus species, may ultimately lead to implant failure. The development of infection-resistant, osteoblast-compatible biomaterials could represent an effective strategy to prevent bacterial  of implants, reducing the need for antibiotics. In this study, the widely used biomaterial titanium was functionalized with BMAP27(1-18), an α-helical cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide that retains potent staphylocidal activity when immobilized on agarose beads. A derivative bearing a short spacer with a free thiol at the N-terminus was coupled to silanized titanium disks via thiol-maleimide chemistry. Tethering was successful, as assessed by Contact angle, Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), with an average surface mass density of 456 ng/cm and a layer thickness of 3 nm. The functionalized titanium displayed antimicrobial properties against a reference strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis with well-known biofilm forming capability. Reduction of bacterial counts and morphological alterations of adhering bacteria, upon  h incubation, indicate a rapid contact-killing effect. The immobilized peptide was not toxic to osteoblasts, which adhered and spread better on functionalized titanium when co-cultured with bacteria, compared to non-coated surfaces. Results suggest that functionalization of titanium with BMAP27(1-18) could be promising for prevention of bacterial  in bone graft applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Group 1 was defined as the control group and group  was defined as the infected control group. Groups 3 and 4 were defined as Dacron grafted and MRSE infected groups, treated with tigecycline and MSCs, respectively. Groups 5 and 6 were performed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft and infected with MRSE. These groups were also administered tigecycline and MSC treatment, respectively. Groups 7 and 8 were infected with MRSE without graft administration and were also performed tigecycline and MSC treatment, respectively. Grafts and soft tissue specimens were collected at 13 days postoperatively. Colony counts of peri-graft tissue were performed. All samples were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the markers that determine stem cell activity.The overall success of the treatments was assessed by the number of rats with MRSE recurrence, regardless of graft used. The difference between the untreated group , tigecycline groups (3, 5 and 7) and MSCs groups (4, 6 and 8) were statistically significant. Success of MSC and tigecycline treatments was similar in Dacron, PTFE, and non-grafted groups. There was a resistance of MRSE infection in Dacron groups to MSC and tigecycline treatments. This was considered to be indicative of the susceptibility of the Dacron grafts to infection. However, there was no significant difference between group  and Dacron groups in terms of bacterial . ELISA results were significant in three cytokines.Mesenchymal stem cells can be considered as an alternative treatment option on its own or part of a combination therapy for control of vascular graft infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655448>Waxing and cultivar affect Salmonella enterica persistence on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) fruit.</a></h2><p>A dearth of knowledge exists on the pathogen-commodity association of Salmonella enterica on cucumber, despite cucumbers being implicated in multiple salmonellosis outbreaks in recent years in the U.S. Data are lacking on cultivar susceptibility to Salmonella  in relation to heterogeneity in fruit surface morphology. Further, fruit waxing is a common practice in wholesale cucumber to preserve the water content of fruit and prolong shelf-life, but its impact on epiphytic microbiota is not well studied. This study investigated the survival of Salmonella Newport and S. Javiana on the surface of six cucumber cultivars of varying surface morphology and the effect of fruit waxing on the persistence of S. Newport. S. Newport and S. Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S. Newport (1.0 and 1.5 log CFU g exocarp decline, respectively) after 24 h (P < 0.05). Fruit waxing lessened S. Newport population decline after 24 h on all cultivars tested (P < 0.01). While there was a ~ log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen . Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

During pregnancy, the female body undergoes unique hormonal changes that contribute to weight gain as well as modulations in immune function that can affect microbiota composition. Several studies have described the vaginal microbiota of pregnant women from the USA, Europe and Mexico. Here we expand our knowledge about the vaginal microbial communities during the third trimester to healthy expectant Brazilian mothers. Vaginal samples were collected from patients delivering at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil. Microbial DNA was isolated from samples and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the PGM Ion Torrent. Brazilian pregnant women presented three distinct types of microbial community at the time of labor. Two microbial communities, Cluster 1 and Cluster 3, presented an overall dominance of Lactobacillus while Cluster  tended to present higher diversity and richness, with the presence of Pseudomonas, Prevotella and other vaginosis related bacteria. About half of the Brazilian mothers sampled here had dominance of L. iners. The proportion of mothers without dominance of any Lactobacillus was higher in Brazil (22%) compared to UK (.4%) and USA, where this community type was not detected. The vaginal microbiota showed significant correlation with the composition of the babies' gut microbiota (p-value = 0.002 with a R of 15.8%). Mothers presenting different vaginal microbiota shared different microorganisms with their newborns, which would reflect on initial colonizers of the developing newborns' gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485164>Biological efficiency and nutritional value of the culinary-medicinal mushroom  cultivated on a sawdust basal substrate supplement with different proportions of grass plants.</a></h2><p> was cultivated on a sawdust basal substrate supplemented with different proportions (30%, 45%, and 60%, respectively) of stalks of three grass plants, i.e.,  (PRS),  (PPS), and  (ZMS), to determine the most effective substrate.

Eggs collected from field-collected gravid females were placed on 0.25% agar slants and given a diet of 1) nematodes (Panagrellus redivivus Linnaeus), ) nematodes + lactalbumin and yeast (LY), 3) microbes from nematode medium, and 4) tap water (autoclaved). Complete larval development to adult stage occurred only in two treatments: 1) nematodes and ) nematodes + LY. Culicoides stellifer larvae could not survive beyond 1 wk on a diet of microbes alone or in the sterile water treatment. Larval survival rates were high using nematode diet (79. ± 11.3% [mean ± SE]) but were slightly lower in the nematode + LY group (66.5 ± 19.6%). Larval stage lasted ~21 d in both treatments. Sex ratio of F1 adults was ~1:1 (M:F) using nematode diet but was male biased (~:1) with nematode + LY diet. These findings collectively suggest that a microbial community is required for midge larvae, either to support invertebrate prey base or as a potential food source. But in the present study, the supplied microbes alone were not sufficient to support midge survival/development. It appears that other nutritional components may also be essential to support the larval survival/development of C. stellifer. Overall, a simple diet of bacterial feeding nematodes and their associated microorganisms can be used to rear C. stellifer larvae under laboratory conditions. However, captive mating in F1 adults poses a major obstacle for successful  of this species currently.© The Author(s) 2019.

The deterioration of a given material often incurs irreparable losses in terms of uniqueness and historical value. Hence preventive actions should be taken. One important challenge is to identify microbes involved in the biodeterioration process. In this study, we analyzed the microbial diversity of an ancient architectonical structure of the Rotunda of Sts. Felix and Adauctus, which is a part of the Wawel Royal Castle located in Krakow, Poland. The Rotunda is unavailable to tourists and could be treated as an extreme habitat due to the low content of nutrients coming either from sandstone plates bound with lime mortar or air movement. Microbial diversity was analyzed with the use of the high-throughput sequencing of marker genes corresponding to fragments of 16S rDNA (for Bacteria) and ITS2 (internal transcribed spacer ) (for Fungi). The results showed that the microbial community adhered to wall surfaces is, to a large extent, endemic. Furthermore, alongside many microorganisms that could be destructive to masonry and mortar (e.g., , ), there were also bacteria, such as species of genera , , and , that can positively affect wall surface properties by reducing the damage caused by the presence of other microorganisms. We also showed that airborne microorganisms probably have little impact on the biodeterioration process as their abundance in the microbial community adhered to the ancient walls was very low.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519748> Assembly and Annotation from Parental and F Puma Genomes of the Florida Panther Genetic Restoration Program.</a></h2><p>In the mid-1990s, the population size of Florida panthers became so small that many individuals manifested traits associated with inbreeding depression (e.g., heart failure, cryptorchidism, high pathogen-parasite load). To mitigate these effects, pumas from Texas were introduced into South Florida to augment genetic variation in Florida panthers. In this study, we report a  puma genome assembly and annotation after resequencing 10 individual genomes from partial Florida-Texas-F trios. The final genome assembly consisted of ∼.6 Gb and 20,561 functionally annotated protein-coding genes. Foremost, expanded gene families were associated with neuronal and embryological development, whereas contracted gene families were associated with olfactory receptors. Despite the latter, we characterized 17 positively selected genes related to the refinement of multiple sensory perceptions, most notably to visual capabilities. Furthermore, genes under positive selection were enriched for the targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, degradation of mRNAs, and transcription of viral genomes. Nearly half (48.5%) of ∼6. million SNPs analyzed in the total sample set contained putative unique Texas alleles. Most of these alleles were likely inherited to subsequent F Florida panthers, as these individuals manifested a threefold increase in observed heterozygosity with respect to their immediate, canonical Florida panther predecessors. Demographic simulations were consistent with a recent  event in North America by a small number of founders from South America during the last glacial period. In conclusion, we provide an extensive set of genomic resources for pumas and elucidate the genomic effects of genetic rescue on this iconic conservation success story.Copyright © 2019, G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31445037>Antigen-Specific Mucosal Immunity Regulates Development of Intestinal Bacteria-Mediated Diseases.</a></h2><p>Dysregulation of the microbiome has been associated with development of complex diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. However, no method has been developed to control disease-associated commensal microbes. We investigated whether immunization with microbial antigens, using CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and/or curdlan as adjuvants, induces systemic antigen-specific IgA and IgG production and affects development of diseases in mice.C57BL/6 mice were given intramuscular injections of antigens (ovalbumin, cholera toxin B-subunit, or pneumococcal surface protein A) combined with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and/or curdlan. Blood and fecal samples were collected weekly and antigen-specific IgG and IgA titers were measured. Lymph nodes and spleens were collected and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antigen-specific splenic T-helper 1 cells, T-helper 17 cells, and memory B cells. Six weeks after primary immunization, mice were given a oral, nasal, or vaginal boost of ovalbumin; intestinal lamina propria, bronchial lavage, and vaginal swab samples were collected and antibodies and cytokines were measured. Some mice were also given oral cholera toxin or intranasal Streptococcus pneumoniae and the severity of diarrhea or pneumonia was analyzed. Gnotobiotic mice were gavaged with fecal material from obese individuals, which had a high abundance of Clostridium ramosum (a commensal microbe associated with obesity and diabetes), and were placed on a high-fat diet  weeks after immunization with C ramosum. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.Serum and fecal samples from mice given injections of antigens in combination with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and curdlan for 3 weeks contained antigen-specific IgA and IgG, and splenocytes produced interferon-gamma and interleukin 17A. Lamina propria, bronchial, and vaginal samples contained antigen-specific IgA after the ovalbumin boost. This immunization regimen prevented development of diarrhea after injection of cholera toxin, and inhibited lung  by S pneumoniae. In gnotobiotic mice colonized with C ramosum and placed on a high-fat diet, the mice that had been immunized with C ramosum became less obese than the nonimmunized mice.Injection of mice with microbial antigens and adjuvant induces antigen-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses. Immunization with S pneumoniae antigen prevented lung infection by this bacteria, and immunization with C ramosum reduced obesity in mice colonized with this microbe and placed on a high-fat diet.

One of the advantages they possess is their ability to be disassociated under in vitro rearing conditions. Various in vitro methods have been developed to produce symbiont colonized and aposymbiotic (symbiont-free) nematodes. Until now, there has been no investigation on how in vitro rearing conditions may have an impact on the storage ability and the protein content of the infective juvenile at different storage temperatures. Thus, in this study, we investigated how infective juvenile longevity and protein content are impacted when the nematodes were reared with two in vitro methods (lipid and liver kidney agar) considering colonized and uncolonized nematodes, and under two different temperatures: 15 °C and 20 °C (mild stress). Infective juveniles reared in vitro (with or without their symbionts) had lower 8-week survival rates. No in vitro reared, colonized IJs survived to the desired 16-week time point. Survival of infective juveniles stored under mild stress temperature (20 °C) was lower than that observed at 15 °C. However, when comparing the interaction between rearing condition and storage temperature, there were not significant differences. With respect to protein content, in vivo, colonized infective juveniles maintained a static protein content over time, suggesting symbiont  may influence protein metabolism and/or turnover in infective juveniles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

C. albicans is the most frequently isolated species of the genus, however, an increase in the occurrence of non-albicans Candida species (NACS) has been reported, which may be attributable to frequent exposure to fluconazole.The aim of this study was to retrospectively assess and compare the prevalence of candiduria and UTIs caused by Candida spp. among inpatients and outpatients at a major clinical center in Hungary, during a 10-year period (2008-2017).Candiduria was detected in 0.11-0.75% of positive samples from outpatients, while this number was significantly higher for inpatients, ranging between 3.49-10.63% (p <0.001). Overall, C. albicans was the most frequently isolated species (65.22% in outpatients and 59.64% in inpatients), however, the presence of C. glabrata as a relevant etiologic agent (~20-30%) is also noteworthy, because there are corresponding therapeutic consequences.A pronounced female dominance (1.7-.15-fold), advanced age (~70 years) and hospitalization of affected patients during candiduria is in line with the findings in literature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600710>Mycorrhizal symbiosis down-regulates or does not change root aquaporin expression in trifoliate orange under drought stress.</a></h2><p>Arbuscular mycorrhizas absorb water from soil to host plants, while the relationship between mycorrhizas and aquaporins (AQPs, membrane water channel proteins, which function in water transport) in mycorrhizal plants is unclear. In this study, Funneliformis mosseae-colonized trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) seedlings were grown in pots fitted with 37-μm nylon meshes at the bottom of each pot to allow mycorrhizal hyphae absorb water from an outer beaker. The expression of seven plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) genes, six tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs) genes, and four nodulin-26 like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) genes were analyzed in roots of both well-watered (WW) and drought stressed (DS) plants. The six-week DS plants dramatically increased hyphal water absorption rate by 1.4 times, as compared with WW plants. Mycorrhizal plants exhibited greater plant growth performance, leaf water status (water potential and relative water content), and gas exchange under both WW and DS conditions. Mycorrhizal inoculation induced diverse expression patterns in these AQPs under WW: up-regulation of PtNIP1;1, PtPIP2;1, and PtPIP2;5, down-regulation of PtNIP1;, PtNIP6;1, PtPIP1;, PtPIP1;5, PtPIP2;8, PtTIP1;1, PtTIP1;, PtTIP1;3, and PtTIP5;1, and no changes in other AQPs. However, the expression of PtPIPs and PtNIPs was down-regulated by mycorrhizal inoculation under DS, and PtTIPs was not induced by mycorrhizal  under DS. The expression pattern of AQPs in response to mycorrhizas under DS is a way of mycorrhizal plants to minimize water loss.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The ability of these fungi to infect insects as well as colonize plant roots is coupled in that EIPF can translocate insect-derived nitrogen from infected insect cadavers in the soil to the host plant in exchange for plant photosynthate. This symbiotic interaction offers other benefits to the plant; EIPF can improve plant growth, they are antagonistic to plant pathogens and herbivores and can enhance plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. The mechanisms and underlying biochemical and genetic features of insect pathogenesis are generally well established. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the underlying mechanisms in this plant symbiotic association. Here we review five aspects of EIPF interactions with host plant roots: (1) rhizosphere , () signaling factors from the plant and EIPF, (3) modulation of plant defense responses, (4) nutrient exchange, and (5) tripartite interactions with insects and other microorganisms. The elucidation of these interactions is fundamental to understanding this symbiotic association for effective application of EIPF in an agricultural setting.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647842>Prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in healthy Chinese population: A system review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To comprehensively determine the prevalence of MRSA in healthy Chinese population, the influencing factors of MRSA  and its antibiotic resistance.Articles that studied prevalence or influencing factors of MRSA carriage in healthy Chinese population were retrieved from PubMed, Ovid database, three Chinese electronic databases. The pooled prevalence of MRSA, its antibiotic resistance and influencing factors were analyzed by STATA12.0.37 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of MRSA was 21.% (95% CI: 18.5%-23.9%), and the prevalence of S.aureus was 15% (95% CI: 10%-19%), with a significant heterogeneity (MRSA: I2 = 97.6%, P<0.001; S.aureus: I2 = 98.4%, P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the pooled prevalence of MRSA was 28% (95%CI: 10%-51%) for Livestock-related workers, 18% (95%CI: 11%-26%) for children, 20% (95%CI: 12%-29%) for healthcare workers, 7% (95%CI: 3%-13%) for community residents. The prevalence of MRSA in studies with oxacillin disk diffusion method (28%, 95%CI: 21%-35%) seemed higher than that with the mecA gene method(12%, 95%CI: 7%-19%). MRSA in studies conducted in Taiwan was more common than in Mainland China and Hong Kong. Similar results were found in meta-regression. Influencing factors for MRSA  were noted in seven eligible studies, they included younger age (OR: 3.54, 95% CI: .38-5.26; OR: .24, 95% CI: 1.73-.9), attending day care centers (DCCs) (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.4-.72; OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.-1.95), flu vaccination (OR:1.73, 95% CI: 1.28-.35), using antibiotics within the past year (OR: .05, 95% CI:1.35-3.11), residing in northern Taiwan (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.19-1.77), regular visits to health care facility (OR: 23.83, 95% CI: .72-209.01), household member working in health care facility (OR: 8.98, 95% CI:1.4-55.63), and contact with livestock (OR: 6.31, 95% CI: 3.44-11.57). Moreover, MRSA was found to be highly resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin, with a pooled resistance ratio of 100, 93, 88, and 75%, respectively. However, no resistance were noted to vancomycin.The pooled prevalence of MRSA was considerably high in health Chinese population. Additionally, these strains showed extreme resistance to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin.

Reduction of  levels on the skin results in an improvement in the clinical condition.The antimicrobial activity of topical products including a bath oil, cream, and wash combining antiseptics and emollients (A+E) was compared to products containing emollients only. The preference of patients with AE for A+E cream or emollient only cream to relieve symptoms of itching, erythema, and inflammation when applied three times daily for 10 days is evaluated. Repeat insult patch testing of the products is also conducted.A significant reduction in microbial counts was found following use of A+E bath oil (4.09±0.32 vs 6.20±0.24 log cfu/mL <0.001), A+E cream (5.50±0.63 vs 5.94±0.72 log cfu/foot =0.002), and A+E wash (.71±0.48 vs 3.57±0.31 log cfu/mL <0.001) compared to the emollient only products. The A+E cream was preferred to the emollient only cream (=0.004) by patients with AE. All three tested formulations were found to be non-irritating and non-sensitizing to the skin.The bath oil, cream, and wash containing antiseptics and emollients decrease the level of bacteria on the skin, including , compared to emollient only products.

Literature suggests that their long-distance dispersal is through aerial transfer. During dispersal, eriophyoids might be captured in vapor or fine drops of water (perhaps most likely in clouds) where they might be protected against water loss and desiccation, but where they would have no food and be exposed to low temperatures and oxygen concentrations. Considerable resistance of these mites to these stressful environmental conditions is expected and has only partly been confirmed experimentally. The aim of the bioassays conducted here was to assess the survival of five eriophyoid species off their host plants, with poor oxygen availability under two temperature regimes. The bioassays were carried out on live mites dipped into two media used as microenvironments: (1) vaseline oil (used also as control treatment), and () water solution of Tween 80 (0.%) and cycloheximide (50 mg/l). The bioassays were performed at 5 ± 1 and 25 ± 1 °C. The survival of mites was assessed weekly (5 °C) or daily (25 °C) by counting live and active specimens. The following species were subjected to the bioassays: Aceria caulobia (a stem gall mite), Aceria ficus (a vagrant mite), Cecidophyopsis hendersoni (a vagrant mite), Colomerus vitis (protogyne/male population and deutogyne morphs; a leaf gall mite) and Phytoptus avellanae (a bud gall mite). The survival rate of the mites was higher at 5 °C than at 25 °C under both experimental conditions. At 5 °C, the survival of almost all species was higher in the water solution (up to 6-7 weeks) than in vaseline oil (3-5 weeks). Longer survival was found for A. caulobia and P. avellanae (gall-making species) than for C. hendersoni and A. ficus (vagrant species). As expected, the deutogynes of C. vitis survived longer than its protogynes. The current results suggest that individuals of some of the tested species are well suited for withstanding cold, starvation and low oxygen rates, which could be found at higher atmospheric layers, within the clouds, allowing them an effective long-distance dispersal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609709>Use of impregnated catheters to decrease  rates in neonates - a randomized controlled pilot trial.</a></h2><p>Nosocomial infections increase mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. Central venous line  is a major risk factor for the development of such infections. In adults and children, antibiotic and antimycotic impregnated catheters have been demonstrated to reduce . However, recently published data showed no significant difference in bloodstream infection in neonates when an impregnated catheter was used. We investigated the effect of impregnation of percutaneously inserted micro-catheters (PICC) on  in preterm and sick term infants in our unit.Neonates were randomly assigned to receive either a standard (S-PICC; n = 34) or antibiotic and antimycotic impregnated (IP-PICC; n = 37) PICC. Catheters were placed and removed according to a standard procedure and subsequently examined by roll-out culture. The primary outcome was the rate of  defined as >15 colony-forming-units/ml. Additional outcomes were catheter associated or systemic infections.The rate of  was lower in neonates who received an IP-PICC as compared to S-PICC (5.6% vs. 12.1% respectively; p = 0.42). However, the difference was not significant. In IP-PICC vs S-PICC, catheter related local infection (CRI) although lower was not statistically significant (.9% vs. 6.1%; p = 0.60). We observed no difference in catheter related systemic infection (CR-SI) (0% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.48). The neonates whose catheters were colonized were predominantly of a lower gestational age (median 254/7, p = 0.05) and males (100%, p = 0.01). In addition, the median colony count in the colonized IP-PICC catheters was lower as compared to S- PICC group (53 vs 250, p = 0.06).The use of antibiotic and antimycotic impregnated PICC-lines in neonates tended to decrease  rates in neonates in our centers but this difference was not significant.

The proximity of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is considered to be one of the foremost risk factors for the development of VRSA. This study aimed to determine the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of intestinal co- with VRE and MRSA.A case-control study was conducted in 52-bed intensive care units (ICUs) of a university-affiliated hospital from September 2012 to October 2017. Active surveillance using rectal cultures for VRE were conducted at ICU admission and on a weekly basis. Weekly surveillance cultures for detection of rectal MRSA were also conducted in patients with VRE carriage. Patients with intestinal co- of VRE and MRSA were compared with randomly selected control patients with VRE  alone (1:1). Vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for MRSA isolates were determined by the Etest.Of the 4679 consecutive patients, 195 cases and 924 controls were detected. The median monthly incidence and duration of intestinal co- with VRE and MRSA were .3/1000 patient-days and 7 days, respectively. The frequency of both MRSA infections and mortality attributable to MRSA were higher in the case group than in the control group: 56.9% vs. 44.1% (P = 0.011) and 8.% vs. 1.0% (P = 0.002), respectively. Independent risk factors for intestinal co- were enteral tube feeding (odds ratio [OR], .09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-3.32), metabolic diseases (OR, 1.75; 95% CI 1.05-.93), male gender (OR, 1.62; 95% CI 1.06-.50), and Charlson comorbidity index < 3 (OR, 3.61; 95% CI 1.88-6.94).

Resistance mechanisms of the bacterium to aminoglycosides are diverse and commonly involve production of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and efflux systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of gene encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and expression level of adeB efflux gene in A. baumannii isolates recovered from burn wound . A total of 47 clinical isolates of A. baumannii were obtained from burned patients admitted to the Burns Teaching Hospital, Tehran, in 2018. Standard antimicrobial susceptibility screening was performed to determine resistance pattern. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was performed to determine aminoglycoside-modifying genes ACC(6'), aph(3')-Via, aph(3')-IIb, aadA1, aphA1 and aph6. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was also carried out to quantify the expression level of the adeB gene. According to the results of the present study, the acc(6') was the predominant aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme gene (80.9%), followed by aph(3')-via, aph6, aph(3')-IIb and aphA1, which was detected in 59.6%, 42.6%, 14.9% and 14.9% of isolates, respectively. None of the A. baumannii isolates harboured the aadA1 gene. The up regulation of adeB gene expression was observed in 63.8% of strains. Moreover, we indicated that there is a relationship between adeB expression and high resistance to gentamicin. Our results revealed that aminoglycoside resistance could be explained by the production of one or a combination of known aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes rather than overexpression of adeB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669610>Nasal  of Staphylococcus aureus and the risk of surgical site infection after spine surgery: a meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Nasal  of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) may increase the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) after spine surgeries, although the results of previous studies were inconsistent.To evaluate the influences of nasal  of SA, methicillin-susceptible SA (MSSA), and methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) on the incidence of SSI after spine surgery.systematic review and meta-analysis.Seven studies including 10,650 patients who underwent nasal swab examination before spine surgeries were included, and 221 patients had nasal  of MRSA at baseline.Association between baseline nasal  of SA, MRSA and SSI after spine surgery.Relevant follow-up studies were identified through systematic searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases.

Pooled results showed that nasal SA (risk ratio [RR]=0.75, p=0.22) or MSSA  (RR=0.60, p=0.22) did not significantly affect the risk of overall SSI after surgeries. However, nasal MRSA  was associated with significantly increased risks of overall SSI and MRSA-SSI (RR=.52 and 6.21 respectively, both p<0.001). Interestingly, the associations between nasal MRSA  and increased risks of overall and MRSA-SSI remained significant in studies without MRSA decolonization, but became insignificant in studies with MRSA decolonization.Nasal MRSA  may be associated with increased risks of overall SSI and MRSA-SSI after spine surgeries, and nasal MRSA decolonization may be associated with a reduction of SSI in these patients.Copyright © 2019.

SR piglets remained with the sows 24 h/d. FF and FP were fed formula or formula with galactooligosaccharide and inulin (4 g/L in a 4:1 ratio). CF and CP were sow-reared for 5 d and then rotated between the sow and formula-feeding every 12 h. Ascending colon contents were collected at day 21. The microbiota was analyzed by pyrosequencing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). VFAs were determined by gas chromatography.Distance-based redundancy analysis of DGGE and pyrosequencing data separated microbiota of FF from CF and SR. CF differed from SR by DGGE, but only a trend (P = 0.09) by pyrosequencing. Bacterial composition of CF was more similar to SR than FF. No bacterial genera in CF significantly differed from SR; however, 9 genera differed between CF and FF, including Lactobacillus, Clostridium XIVa, and Fusobacterium. VFA concentrations were similar between CF and SR, while isovalerate and isobutyrate were -fold greater (P  < 0.05) in CF than FF. Neither microbiota nor VFA profile was affected by prebiotic supplementation.Microbial  patterns and VFA profiles of CF piglets were more similar to SR piglets than FF piglets. Prebiotics did not affect piglet bacterial composition and/or VFA concentrations relative to the main feeding modes (FF and CF).

Numerous REV7 binding partners have been identified, including the human small GTPase Ras-associated nuclear protein (RAN), which acts as a potential upstream regulator of REV7. Notably, the  invasin IpaB hijacks REV7 to disrupt cell cycle control to prevent intestinal epithelial cell renewal and facilitate bacterial . However, the structural details of the REV7-RAN and REV7-IpaB interactions are mostly unknown. Here, using fusion protein and rigid maltose-binding protein tagging strategies, we determined the crystal structures of these two complexes at .00-.35 Å resolutions. The structures revealed that both RAN and IpaB fragments bind the "safety belt" region of REV7, inducing rearrangement of the C-terminal β-sheet region of REV7, conserved among REV7-related complexes. Of note, the REV7-binding motifs of RAN and IpaB each displayed some unique interactions with REV7 despite sharing consensus residues. Structural alignments revealed that REV7 has an adaptor region within the safety belt region that can rearrange secondary structures to fit a variety of different ligands. Our structural and biochemical results further indicated that REV7 preferentially binds GTP-bound RAN, implying that a GTP/GDP-bound transition of RAN may serve as the molecular switch that controls REV7's activity. These results provide insights into the regulatory mechanism of REV7 in cell cycle control, which may help with the development of small-molecule inhibitors that target REV7 activity.© 2019 Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597748>Evaluation of the Direct MacConkey Method for Identification of Carbapenem-Resistant Gram-Negative Organisms from Rectal Swabs: Re-evaluating Zone Diameter Cutoffs.</a></h2><p>The optimal method to screen for gastrointestinal  with carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO) has yet to be established. The Direct MacConkey plate method (Direct MAC) demonstrates high sensitivity for CRO detection, but established zone diameter (ZD) criteria for ertapenem (≤27 mm) and meropenem (≤32 mm) result in high rates of false-positives upon confirmatory testing. To increase specificity, we screened for CRO in two high-risk wards using the Direct MAC method, recorded ZDs for each sample, and generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the optimal ZD cutoff criteria. Of 6,868 swabs obtained over an 18-month period, 4,766 (69%) had growth on MAC plates and ,500 (36%) met criteria for further evaluation based on previously established ZDs around the carbapenem disks. A total of 812 (12%) swabs were confirmed positive for at least one CRO, including 213 (3 %) carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO), resulting in a specificity of 78% for the Direct MAC plate. Reducing the ertapenem and meropenem ZDs to ≤25 mm improved specificity to 83%, decreasing the confirmatory testing workload by 32%. The sensitivity with the lower ZD criteria were 89% for CRO and 94% for CPO, respectively. The Direct MAC plate method criteria for CRO testing can be modified to balance the sensitivity and specificity of CRO while reducing the burden on clinical microbiology laboratories. These modifications can be particularly helpful in regions with a low CRO prevalence.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636880>Retrospective Analysis of Microbial  Patterns in Central Venous Catheters, 2013-2017.</a></h2><p>This study was performed to provide epidemiological information on microbial  in central venous catheters (CVCs).CVCs submitted to Medical Microbiology Laboratory from January 1, 2013, through October 1, 2017, which met our criteria would be included for analysis.
