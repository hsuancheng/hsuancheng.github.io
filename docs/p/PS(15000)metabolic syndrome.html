Plasma citrulline, an amino acid produced by enterocytes, is considered a measure of enterocyte mass. This analysis assessed changes in plasma citrulline levels in patients with SBS in 2 phase III clinical studies of teduglutide.Both teduglutide studies (.05 or .10 mg/kg/day in CL0600-004 and .05 mg/kg/day in CL0600-020) were phase III, 24-week, double-blind, and placebo controlled. Plasma citrulline levels were analyzed and validated by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.In both the CL0600-004 and CL0600-020 studies, change in mean plasma citrulline concentrations at Week 24 vs. baseline was significantly greater with teduglutide compared with placebo (10.9 (.05-mg/kg/day dose) and .7 (.10-mg/kg/day dose) vs. 2. μmol/L and 20.6 vs. .7 μmol/L, respectively, for each study (P≤.0001 for each comparison with placebo)). Teduglutide treatment was associated with reductions from baseline in  (parenteral support) volume requirements; however, a significant correlation between  reduction and increase in plasma citrulline at Week 24 was observed in only one out of the three teduglutide treatment groups.In 2 phase III studies, patients receiving teduglutide had significant increases in plasma citrulline at Week 24 compared with patients receiving placebo. Increases in plasma citrulline concentrations likely reflect enterocyte mass expansion, but no clear correlation was detected between change in plasma citrulline and change in weekly  volume.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470644>Body adiposity index as a risk factor for the metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal Caucasian, African American, and Filipina women.</a></h1><p>To investigate the utility of the body adiposity index (BAI) and its association with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in older Caucasian (n=369), African American (n=336) and Filipina (n=275) women.Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, anthropometric measures, plasma glucose and medical history were assessed in 1993-1999.Despite smaller body size, 32.7% of Filipina women had higher MetS compared to African American and Caucasian women based on the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) (32.7% vs 19.6% and 13.3%, respectively) or the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) (42.6% vs 33.% and 18.7%, respectively <.05). BAI had higher positive correlations with BMI, %body fat (%BF), and %truncal fat in Caucasian than African American and Filipina women. Adjusted for age, smoking, estrogen use, exercise, and alcohol intake, odds of the MetS (NCEP) were 2.08 (95%CI: 1.52-2.85) by BAI, 3.04 (95%CI: 2.11-4.38) by BMI, and 2.13 (95%CI: 1.52-3.00) by %BF for Caucasian women; .92 (95%CI: .69-1.23) by BAI, 1.44 (95%CI: 1.09-1.90) by BMI, and 1.12 (95%CI: .84-1.50) by %BF for African American women; and 1.14 (95%CI: .88-1.47) by BAI, 1.51 (95%CI: 1.-1.97) by BMI, and .96 (95%CI: .74-1.25) by %BF for Filipinas.BAI was better able to assess adiposity in postmenopausal Caucasian women compared to African American and Filipina women. This index can distinguish ethnic differences in MetS confirmed by %BF.Copyright © 2014 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A prospective -year follow-up of 370 schoolgirls starting at age 10 was performed. Age 14 waist circumference was the most important explanatory variable for IFG + T2DM during ages 19 to 24 (P = .002; odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.10), along with oligomenorrhea category from ages 14 to 19 (, 1, 2, ≥3 reports over 6 years; P = .032; odds ratio, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.14). Impaired fasting glucose + T2DM at ages 19 to 24 were more common in girls having 1 (6%), 2 (11%), and ≥3 (38%) oligomenorrhea reports from ages 14 to 19 than in girls without oligomenorrhea (3%; P = .0003). Positive explanatory variables (all  ≤ .05) for homeostasis model assessment of IR at ages 19 to 24 included age 14 waist (partial R(2) = 30.1%), oligomenorrhea with hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary ; partial R(2) = 4.1%), black race (3.8%), and oligomenorrhea frequency during ages 14 to 19 (.8%); sex hormone binding globulin was a negative explanatory variable (.7%). This is the first prospective study to report an independent association of adolescent oligomenorrhea with young adult IFG + T2DM, with insulin and glucose levels, and with IR. Age 14 waist circumference, oligomenorrhea with hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary ), black race, oligomenorrhea frequency at ages 14 to 19, and age 14 sex hormone binding globulin were independently associated with IR at ages 19 to 24, potentially facilitating primary prevention of IFG, T2DM, and hyperinsulinemia.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

They are also major determinants in chronic kidney disease development and progression in patients with primary renal diseases characterized by persistent or recurrent proteinuria. The purpose of the study was to assess urinary excretion of alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST), pi-glutathione S-transferase (pi-GST), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and serum NGAL level in children with idiopathic nephrotic  (INS).the study group comprised of 39 children with INS and the control group consisted of 20 healthy children. A total of 23 patients were affected with steroid-dependent nephrotic  (SDNS) and 16 with steroid-resistant nephrotic  (SRNS). In the majority of patients, a histopathologic examination revealed minimal change disease (MCD)-25 (64%). Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MesPGN), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) were diagnosed in 4 (10.3 %), 6 (.5%), 2 (5.1%), and 2 (5.1%) children, respectively. Urinary alpha-GST, urinary pi-GST, urinary KIM-1, and urinary and serum NGAL concentrations were measured using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The urinary results were expressed in nanograms per milligram of creatinine (ng/mg).The authors observed significantly higher levels of urinary alpha-GST/creatinine ratio (P = .03), urinary KIM-1/creatinine ratio (P < .02), serum NGAL level (P < .01), and urinary NGAL/creatinine ratio (P = .02) in children with INS compared with controls. The median values of urinary pi-GST/creatinine ratio in children with INS and controls did not differ significantly. In children with SRNS, the median values of urinary NGAL/creatinine ratio (P = .02) and urinary KIM-1/creatinine ratio (P = .02) were significantly higher compared with children with SDNS. The authors noted significant positive correlation between KIM-1/creatinine ratio and proteinuria (r = .56, P < .05). The analysis of alpha-GST/creatinine ratio, pi-GST/creatinine ratio, sNGAL, and uNGAL/creatinine ratio concerning the histopathologic examination, the duration of the disease, and number of relapses did not show any significant differences.1. Both children with SDNS and those with SRNS were characterized by increased tubular injury marker levels. 2. Patients with SRNS and higher proteinuria are more susceptible to early kidney damage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23160997>Cardiovascular reactivity and cardiometabolic risk in adolescents.</a></h1><p>Cardiovascular reactivity has been examined as a risk marker or factor in the pathogenesis of hypertension or cardiovascular disease, but few have examined the relationship with the  .We examined whether cardiovascular reactivity to laboratory stress is associated with individual cardiometabolic risk factors and their co-occurrence. A significant positive relationship was hypothesized for both individual and clustered risk factors in their cross-sectional associations with reactivity to multiple stressors.A sample of 144, -17-year-old adolescents (74 % boys) largely from ethnic minority groups (54 % Hispanic White, 26 % Black) were identified at annual blood pressure (BP) screening (39 % with elevated BP) at high schools in Miami, Florida, USA. Participants completed the evaluated speaking, mirror star tracing, and cold pressor tasks, as well as cardiometabolic risk factor blood sampling. Participants were classified into   criterion groups (, 1, 2, or ≥3 criteria) based on American Heart Association adult criteria.Multiple regression analyses with individual   variables demonstrated that diastolic (D)BP reactivity during the mirror star tracing task accounted for 1.3 %, 3.8 %, and 5.1 % of the respective variances in casual systolic BP, waist circumference, and triglycerides ( < .05). In multinomial logistic regression models, increased DBP reactivity during mirror star tracing and cold pressor tasks, and decreased HR reactivity during the cold pressor, were associated with greater likelihood of risk factor co-occurrence (ranging from 8.3 % to .8 %).Findings indicate that autonomic reactivity to the mirror star tracing and cold pressor tasks, but not the evaluated speaking task, is associated with risk factor co-occurrence, and reactivity may be a clinical prognosticator of cardiometabolic disease risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18182048>Lipidomic analysis of the retina in a rat model of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome: alterations in docosahexaenoic acid content of phospholipid molecular species.</a></h1><p>Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a complex hereditary disease caused by an enzymatic defect in the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Progressive retinal degeneration occurs in an AY9944-induced rat model of SLOS, with biochemical and electroretinographic hallmarks comparable with the human disease. We evaluated alterations in the non-sterol lipid components of the retina in this model, compared with age-matched controls, using lipidomic analysis. The levels of 16:-22:6 and 18:-22:6 phosphatidylcholine molecular species in retinas were less by > 50% and > 33%, respectively, in rats treated for either 2 or 3 months with AY9944. Relative to controls, AY9944 treatment resulted in > 60% less di-22:6 and > % less 18:-22:6 phosphatidylethanolamine molecular species. The predominant phosphatidylserine () molecular species in control retinas were 18:-22:6 and di-22:6; notably, AY9944 treatment resulted in > 80% less di-22:6 , relative to controls. Remarkably, these changes occurred in the absence of n3  acid deficiency in plasma or . Thus, the retinal lipidome is globally altered in the SLOS rat model, relative to control rats, with the most profound changes being less phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and  molecular species containing docosahexaenoic acid (22:6). These findings suggest that SLOS may involve additional metabolic compromise beyond the primary enzymatic defect in the cholesterol pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18294485>Fenofibrate reduces lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2 mass and oxidative lipids in hypertriglyceridemic subjects with the  .</a></h1><p>Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is a macrophage-synthesized lipase that is primarily bound to small electronegative low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 oxidatively modifies LDL and generates the proinflammatory byproducts oxidized fatty acids (ox-FAs) and lysophosphatidylcholine. Fenofibrate reduces Lp-PLA2 mass; however, it remains unknown whether the anti-inflammatory effects of fenofibrate are related to changes in LDL subclasses.This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial designed to investigate the effects of 3-month treatment with fenofibrate (160 mg/d) on Lp-PLA2 mass, LDL subclasses, and ox-FAs among 55 hypertriglyceridemic (> or = 1.7 and < 6.78 mmol/L) subjects with the  .Fenofibrate treatment lowered fasting Lp-PLA2 mass by 13.2% (-19. to -7.7) versus placebo (2.3% [-5. to 4.1], P = .0002) and total ox-FA by .5% (-34.2 to +1.4) versus an 11.5% increase with placebo (P = .0013). In age-, sex-, and treatment-adjusted models, changes in Lp-PLA2 mass were associated with reductions in chemical LDL cholesterol (r = .59, P < .01) and measured total LDL particles (LDL-) (r = .64, P < .01) and small LDL- (r = .57, P < .01). In models that included small LDL, effects of fenofibrate on Lp-PLA2 mass were attenuated (P = .125), but not in models that included LDL cholesterol (P < .0001) and LDL- (P = .005). Changes in Lp-PLA2 mass were not significantly associated with changes in ox-FA or inflammatory markers.Among hypertriglyceridemic subjects with the  , fenofibrate therapy reduced Lp-PLA2 mass, and these changes were associated with fewer small LDL-.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15870904>Increased myocardial N-myristoyltransferase activity in rotenone model of Parkinsonism.</a></h1><p>There is widespread brain pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD), with the primary pathology in the substantia nigra. Oxidative stress is believed to play a role in cell death in PD. Rotenone is a mitochondrial toxin which can produce Parkinson  () in rats. Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), which catalyzes the co-translational transfer of myristate from myristoyl-CoA to the amino-terminal glycine residue of selected polypeptides, is increased in the myocardium of ischemia-reperfusion rat model myocardium. Animals received rotoneone (n=10) or placebo vehicle (n=6) via Alzet osmotic pumps. Mean cardiac muscle NMT activity of placebo treated (control) rats was .608+/-.366 units/mg protein. Rats with mild or no detectable  features on rotenone showed slight (mean .853+/-.192) but insignificantly increased activity. Rats that had moderately severe  features had higher level of NMT activity (mean 1.223+/-.057), which was borderline significant compared to controls (P=.066). Rats with severe  features had the highest NMT activity (1.353+/-.128) which was significantly greater compared to controls (P=.003) and to the rats that had equivocal or no motor slowing (P=.005). Our data show cardiac  dysfunction in a rotenone rat model of . The severity of this change correlates with the severity of motor manifestations. Further studies of NMT activity in human PD cases and patients with cardiomyopathy of unknown cause may provide valuable information in these disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25772036>Sarcopaenia is associated with NAFLD independently of  and insulin resistance: Nationwide surveys (KNHANES 2008-2011).</a></h1><p>Although sarcopaenia is associated with -related comorbidities, its influence on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or steatohepatitis has not been fully determined. We aimed to investigate the direct relationship between sarcopaenia and NAFLD or steatohepatitis in the general population.We conducted a cross-sectional study using nationally representative samples of ,132 subjects from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2008-2011. Subjects were defined as having NAFLD when they had higher scores from previously validated NAFLD prediction models such as the hepatic steatosis index, comprehensive NAFLD score and NAFLD liver fat score. BARD and FIB-4 scores were used to define advanced fibrosis in subjects with NAFLD. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) [SMI(%)=total appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg)/weight (kg)×100] measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to diagnose sarcopaenia with cut points of 32.2% for men and 25.5% for women.SMI was inversely correlated with all NAFLD predicting scores (<.001). After stratification, sarcopaenic subjects had an increased risk of NAFLD regardless of  (odds ratios [ORs]=1.55 to 3.02, depending on models; all <.001) or metabolic syndrome (ORs=1.63 to 4.00, all <.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis also demonstrated this independent association between sarcopaenia and NAFLD after adjusting for confounding factors related to  or insulin resistance (ORs=1.18 to 1.22, all <.001). Furthermore, among the NAFLD population, subjects with lower SMIs were likely to have advanced fibrosis compared with non-sarcopaenic individuals (BARD and FIB-4: ORs=1.83 and 1.69, respectively; both <.001). Compared with non-exercised subjects, individuals who exercised regularly had a lower risk of NAFLD (p<.001), particularly among obese people with well-preserved muscle mass.Sarcopaenia is associated with increased risks of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, independent of  or metabolic control.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The vast majority of previous data were based on  subjects from hospitals, and when based on data from the general population the  subjects were often identified in insurance health databases. Furthermore, many studies used a single method approach, e.g. self-reported diagnosis.We have therefore investigated a possible association between  and MetS on  subjects from the hospital as well as the general population using combined methods, i.e. self-reported diagnosis, physical examinations and blood samples.A population- and hospital-based cross-sectional study of the possible association between  and MetS.Thirty-six hospital  subjects, 860 population  subjects and 14,016 non- subjects were identified. The odds ratios (ORs) for hospital  subjects and population  subjects vs. population non- subjects, respectively, were 5.14 (2.47-10.69) and 1.29 (1.09-1.53) for MetS, 4.55 (1.91-10.85) and 1.16 (.85-1.59) for diabetes, 1.92 (.87-4.22) and 1.00 (.86-1.17) for hypertension, 4.34 (1.86-10.10) and 1.

This study aimed to explore the relationship between butyrylcholinesterase and lipids levels, among apparently healthy adults.During 2009, 490 volunteers (46 ± 16 years, 40% men) who visited the outpatients' office of our hospital for routine examinations were consecutively enrolled in the study (participation rate 85%). Biochemical analyses were performed through established procedures, after 12 h fasting, and haematological as well as biochemical parameters were measured. Anthropometric, lifestyle and dietary characteristics were also recorded to account for potential confounding.Butyrylcholinesterase activity was positively correlated with glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, haptoglobin and platelet count, after age-sex adjustments (all  < .05). Further adjustment for a series of anthropometric, lifestyle and clinical characteristics revealed that only BMI, LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides were positively associated with serum butyrylcholinesterase activity.This study demonstrated the positive association of serum butyrylcholinesterase activity with BMI, LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides, a fact that could state a hypothesis for a novel marker of atherosclerotic disease that could - together with other biomarkers - improve our potential to assess cardiovascular disease risk.</p></html>
