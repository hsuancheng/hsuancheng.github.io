Male CD-1 mice were topically pre-treated with either CUR or CUR-Br for 30 min prior to an application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-. After 6 h, mice were killed, and ear punches were measured for their weight and thickness as a marker of edema and . CUR-Br demonstrated a higher anti-inflammatory efficacy compared to CUR. CUR and CUR-Br at 1.0 μmol suppressed the TPA-induced increase in the ear weight by 26.0% and 57.2%, and decreased TPA-induced increase in the ear thickness by 22.2% and 84.7%, respectively. The inhibitory effects of Cur-Br were associated with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, KC/GRO, IL-10, IL-17, and IL-23). In addition, CUR-Br significantly downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory signaling proteins such as p-STAT3, STAT3, PI3K, AKT, p-p65, and COX-2. Overall, our results demonstrated that the curcumin analogue, CUR-Br, showed stronger anti-inflammatory properties than CUR in inhibiting TPA-induced inflammatory response in mouse skin.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of progesterone resistance and to identify the key genes and pathways mediating progesterone resistance in endometrial cancer using bioinformatics analysis.We developed a stable MPA (medroxyprogesterone )-resistant endometrial cancer cell subline named IshikawaPR. Microarray analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from triplicate samples of Ishikawa and IshikawaPR cells. PANTHER, DAVID and Metascape were used to perform gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, and cBioPortal for progesterone receptor (PGR) coexpression analysis. GEO microarray (GSE17025) was utilized for validation. The protein-protein interaction network (PPI) and modular analyses were performed using Metascape and Cytoscape. Further validation were performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).In total, 821 DEGs were found and further analyzed by GO, KEGG pathway enrichment and PPI analyses. We found that lipid metabolism, immune system and , extracellular environment-related processes and pathways accounted for a significant portion of the enriched terms. PGR coexpression analysis revealed 7 PGR coexpressed genes (ANO1, SOX17, CGNL1, DACH1, RUNDC3B, SH3YL1 and CRISPLD1) that were also dramatically changed in IshikawaPR cells. Kaplan-Meier survival statistics revealed clinical significance for 4 out of 7 target genes. Furthermore, 8 hub genes and 4 molecular complex detections (MCODEs) were identified.Using microarray and bioinformatics analyses, we identified DEGs and determined a comprehensive gene network of progesterone resistance. We offered several possible mechanisms of progesterone resistance and identified therapeutic and prognostic targets of progesterone resistance in endometrial cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802613>Antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of Philodendron bipinnatifidum Schott ex Endl (Araceae).</a></h2><p>ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Popular medicine use stems of Philodendron bipinnatifidum (Araceae) in  cases, such as in erysipelas, as well as orchitis and rheumatism treatment. The present study, conducted for the first time in literature, investigate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of P. bipinnatifidum stems ethyl  extract (EPB).GC/MS and HPLC analysis were performed for EPB extract. We used EPB at 250, 375 and 500 mg/kg (oral route, p.o.) in male Swiss mice. The antinociceptive activity of the plant extract assessed by acetic acid induced writhing and formalin tests. To investigate the possible participation of opioid system in EPB-mediated effects, we previously administered naloxone to the mice. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using carrageenan-induced paw oedema. The open-field test aimed to investigate the possible EPB effects on the locomotor and exploratory activities. To assess the protective role of EPB on carrageenan-induced oxidative stress, the levels of NPSH, TBARS, as well as SOD and CAT activities were evaluated in blood and paw tissue. The acute toxicity of the EPB was investigated using OECD 423 guideline.The EPB chemical analysis by GC/MS and HPLC revealed the presence of flavonoids (luteolin and quercetin) and phytosterols (β-sitosterol and stigmasterol). The oral treatment with the EPB inhibited mice abdominal writhings (P < 0.01) at 375 and 500 mg/kg, and reduced the formalin effect at the first-phase (500 mg/kg, P < 0.05) and also at the second-phase (500 mg/kg, P < 0.001) of the test. EPB (375 and 500 mg/kg) did not alter spontaneous locomotion in open field test, however the number of fecal bolus was significantly lower for the EPB group at 500 mg/kg when compared to the vehicle group (P < 0.05). The pretreatment with naloxone caused significant inhibition of antinociceptive activity induced by EPB in the formalin test, revealing the possible involvement of opioid receptors. EPB extract administered at 500 mg/kg (p.o.) prevented carrageenan-induced paw oedema (P < 0.05 and 0.01) until 6 h after carragenan injection. Evaluation of TBARS and NPSH levels, SOD and CAT activities in the blood and paw tissue of animals submitted to the carrageenan assay suggested that the anti-inflammatory effect of EPB may be linked to oxidative stress inhibition. The acute administration of the EPB (2000 mg/kg, p.o.) caused no mortality, demonstrating low toxicity.The extract of P. bipinnatifidum displays antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities, causing no toxicological effects. The pharmacological activity of this vegetal species may be related to the presence of flavonoids and phytosterols. Our results support the ethnomedical use of this vegetal species as analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Among UT, the adipokine Chemerin induces vascular dysfunction by targeting both endothelial and vascular smooth muscular cells (EC and VSMC). As Citrate anion modulates oxidative metabolism, systemic  and vascular function, we evaluated whether citrate-buffered dialysis improves HD efficiency, inflammatory parameters and chemerin-mediated microvascular injury. 45 patients were treated in sequence with , citrate and, again, -buffered dialysis solution (3 months per interval). At study admission and after each treatment switch, we evaluated dialysis efficacy and circulating levels of chemerin and different inflammatory biomarkers. In vitro, we stimulated EC and VSMC with patients' plasma and we investigated the role of chemerin as UT. Citrate dialysis increased HD efficacy and reduced plasma levels of CRP, fibrinogen, IL6 and chemerin. In vitro, patients' plasma induced EC and VSMC dysfunction. These effects were reduced by citrate-buffered solutions and paralleled by the decrease of chemerin levels. Consistently, chemerin receptor knockdown reduced EC and VSMC dysfunction. In conclusion, Switching from  to citrate improved dialysis efficacy and inflammatory parameters; in vitro, chemerin-induced EC and VSMC injury were decreased by using citrate as dialysis buffer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728839>Preparative Separation of Three Monoterpenes from  var.  Using Centrifugal Partition Chromatography.</a></h2><p>Three monoterpenes, namely, 9-hydroxy isoegomaketone (), isoegomaketone (), and perilla ketone (), were successfully separated from the supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO) extract of the leaves of  var.  (cv. Antisperill; Lamiaceae) by centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC). To obtain large quantities of these materials required for studies on their mechanism of action and  effectiveness in , we used CPC because of its high loading capacity and reproducibility to purify the three compounds. Compound  (2.60 mg, 96.7% purity at 254 nm) was purified from 500 mg of the SC-CO extract of  var.  (cv. Antisperill), using a two-phase solvent system comprising -hexane/ethyl /ethanol/water (5:5:5:5 v/v) in a descending mode. As compounds  (56.1 mg, 97.6% purity at 254 nm) and  (78.6 mg, 96.1% purity at 254 nm) are highly volatile and difficult to recover from an aqueous mobile phase after purification during the drying process, they were obtained from the same amount of the processed extract in an ascending mode using the upper organic phase as the mobile phase (-hexane/ethyl /ethanol/water, 8:2:8:2 v/v). The structures of compounds - were confirmed by H- and C-NMR analysis. Thus, based on our findings, we recommend centrifugal partition chromatography as a powerful technique for purifying the active principal compounds  and  from the leaves of  var. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30858736>Glycine supplementation mitigates lead-induced renal injury in mice.</a></h2><p>Lead (Pb) is an environmental pollutant responsible for various organ damages including renal injury. It seems that OS and associated events are crucial mechanisms of lead-induced renal dysfunction. The current study aimed to explore the potential protective effects of glycine against renal injury caused by lead in mice.Mature male mice (n=32) were allocated into four groups. The following treatment regimens were the control (vehicle-treated); Pb- (20 mg/kg/day, gavage); Pb- + glycine (500 mg/kg/day, IP); and Pb- + glycine (1,000 mg/kg/day, IP). Pb- + glycine was administered for 14 consecutive days, Pb- was given first and then glycine at least 6 hours later. On day 15, the subjects were anesthetized, and samples were collected. Serum biomarkers such as BUN and serum creatinine were monitored along with formation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, kidney GSH level, and histopathological changes.Based on the results, BUN and serum creatinine levels significantly increased following exposure to lead. Glycine supplementation (500 and 1,000 mg/kg, IP) decreased BUN and creatinine serum levels (<0.001). Biomarkers of OS were also reduced in renal tissue following glycine therapy in Pb-exposed mice (<0.001). Histopathological changes were observed in mice treated with lead as tubular dilation, protein cast, vacuolization, and . In this regard, glycine inhibited histopathological alterations in kidney caused by lead exposure.It was found that glycine treatment significantly mitigated Pb-induced renal injury most likely through alleviating OS and the associated deleterious outcomes on the kidney tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650328>Successful elevation of circulating  and propionate by dietary modulation does not alter T-regulatory cell or cytokine profiles in healthy humans: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Increased circulating concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) achieved by ingestion of high-fibre diets is associated with anti-inflammatory effects through promotion of FoxP3+ regulatory T(reg) cells in mouse models. This study aimed to determine whether similar increments in blood SCFA levels can be achieved in humans and whether these are associated with similar immune modulatory effects.In a pilot single-blinded, randomised, controlled cross-over study in ten healthy subjects, the effects were determined of high- (39 g/day) and low-fibre (18 g/day) intake (all food provided) on SCFA (gas chromatography), proportions of Treg cells (flow cytometry) and a panel of cytokines (multiplex methodology) measured in peripheral blood at day 5 of each diet.Actual fibre intake differed between the diets by 19 [16-21] g/day (P< 0.001). Median [range] total plasma SCFA levels with high-fibre intake were 174.5 [104.8-249.5] µmol/L, which were greater than those associated with low-fibre intake at 59.0 [26.5-79.9] (P < 0.001). Differences were significantly different for both  and propionate. The frequencies of total CD4 T cells and T-regulatory cells, and concentrations of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were not significantly different between the dietary interventions.Plasma SCFA levels can be modulated by altering dietary fibre consumption in healthy individuals with increments similar to those achieved in murine studies. Five days of diet intervention did not result in changes in regulatory T-cell proportions and cytokine concentrations in peripheral blood, and may require longer duration of dietary change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987036>Individual Immune-Modulatory Capabilities of MSC-Derived Extracellular Vesicle (EV) Preparations and Recipient-Dependent Responsiveness.</a></h2><p>Treatment with extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have been suggested as novel therapeutic option in acute -associated disorders due to their immune-modulatory capacities. As we have previously observed differences in the cytokine profile of independent MSC-EV preparations, functional differences of MSC-EV preparations have to be considered. To evaluate the immune-modulatory capabilities of specific MSC-EV preparations, reliable assays are required to characterize the functionality of MSC-EV preparations prior to administration to a patient. To this end, we established an in vitro assay evaluating the immune-modulatory capacities of MSC-EV preparations. Here, we compared the efficacy of four independent MSC-EV preparations to modulate the induction of T cell differentiation and cytokine production after phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)/Ionomycin stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from six healthy donors. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the four MSC-EV preparations differentially modulate the expression of surface markers, such as CD45RA, on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in shifts in the frequencies of effector and effector memory T cells. Moreover, cytokine profile in T cell subsets was affected in a MSC-EV-specific manner exclusively in CD8+ naïve T cells. Strikingly, hierarchical clustering revealed that the T cell response towards the MSC-EV preparations largely varied among the different PBMC donors. Thus, besides defining functional activity of MSC-EV preparations, it will be crucial to test whether patients intended for treatment with MSC-EV preparations are in principal competent to respond to the envisioned MSC-EV therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513646>Infection/-associated preterm delivery within 14 days of presentation with symptoms of preterm labour: A multivariate predictive model.</a></h2><p>Multi-marker tests hold promise for identifying symptomatic women at risk of imminent preterm delivery (PTD, <37 week's gestation). This study sought to determine the relationship of inflammatory mediators and metabolites in cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) with spontaneous PTD (sPTD) and delivery within 14 days of presentation with symptoms of preterm labour (PTL). CVF samples from 94 (preterm = 19, term = 75) singleton women with symptoms of PTL studied between 19+0-36+6 weeks' gestation were analysed for cytokines/chemokines by multiplexed bead-based immunoassay, while metabolites were quantified by enzyme-based spectrophotometry in a subset of 61 women (preterm = 16, term = 45). Prevalence of targeted vaginal bacterial species was determined for 70 women (preterm = 14, term = 66) by PCR. Overall, 10 women delivered within 14 days of sampling. Predictive capacities of individual biomarkers and cytokine-metabolite combinations for sPTD and delivery within 14 days of sampling were analysed by logistic regression models and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Fusobacterium sp., Mubiluncus mulieris and Mycoplasma hominis were detected in more preterm-delivered than term women (P<0.0001), while, M. curtisii was found in more term-delivered than preterm women (P<0.0001). RANTES (0.91, 0.65-1.0), IL-6 (0.79, 0.67-0.88), and /Glutamate ratio (0.74, 0.61-0.85) were associated with delivery within 14 days of sampling (AUC, 95% CI). There were significant correlations between cytokines and metabolites, and several cytokine-metabolite combinations were associated with sPTD or delivery within 14 days of sampling (e.g. L/D-lactate ratio+/Glutamate ratio+IL-6: 0.84, 0.67-0.94). Symptomatic women destined to deliver preterm and within 14 days of sampling express significantly higher pro-inflammatory mediators at mid to late gestation. In this cohort, IL-6, /Glutamate ratio and RANTES were associated with delivery within 14 days of sampling, consistent with their roles in modulating infection--associated preterm labour in women presenting with symptoms of preterm birth. Replication of these observations in larger cohorts of women could show potential clinical utility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727882>Chemical Composition, Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Activity Evaluation of the Lebanese Propolis Extract.</a></h2><p>Propolis is a resinous substance produced by bees and known to possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activities.This study is aimed at evaluating the in vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory potential of the Crude Ethanolic Extract (CE) of Lebanese propolis and its Ethyl  Fraction (EAF).Chemical content of propolis was characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography and LC-MS/MS. COX-2 and iNOS protein expression, nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PGE2) release in LPS-activated RAW monocytes were achieved respectively by western blot and spectrophotometry. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH free radical scavenging assay. Measurement of paw thickness in carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice and pathologic assessment of  in paw sections were used to judge the anti-inflammatory properties of propolis.Pathology analysis revealed in the treated group significant reduction of immune cell infiltration and edema. Both extract and ethyl  fraction showed significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in LPS-treated RAW cells characterized by the inhibition of COX-2 and iNOS protein expression, as well as PGE2 and NO release. Chemical analysis of the crude extract and its ethyl  fraction identified 28 different compounds of which two phenolic acids and nine other flavonoids were also quantified. Ferulic acid, caffeic acid, chrysin, galangin, quercetin, and pinocembrin were among the most representative compounds.Lebanese propolis is rich in a various amount of flavonoids which showed promising antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. Additionally, chemical analysis showed unique chemical compositions with the potential of identifying ingredients with interesting anti-inflammatory activities.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30794862>Influence of traditionally used Nepalese plants on wound healing and immunological properties using primary human cells in vitro.</a></h2><p>The improvement of wound healing has always been an important issue for both ethnopharmacological and modern medical research. In this study, we used state-of-the-art methods to investigate extracts of plants used traditionally in Nepal for more than 1000 years to treat inflammatory injuries.We focused on the potential of the plant extracts to ameliorate wound healing and to influence immune modulatory properties.Nine Nepalese plant extracts in three different solvents (methanol, ethyl , petroleum ether) were immunologically characterised. Water-soluble tetrazolium (WST-1) assays and scratch assays were performed to determine their impact on viability and wound healing capacity of human keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Effects on proliferation, viability and function of physiologically relevant anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulated primary human T lymphocytes were assessed using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), annexin V/propidium iodide staining assays and flow cytometry-based surface receptor characterisation. The secretion level of interleukin-2 (IL-2) was analysed with the ELISA technique. Dendritic cells were generated out of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by CD14 magnetic bead selection. Flow cytometry-based surface receptor characterisation and ELISA-based technique were used to evaluate the DC activation state and the interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion level.We demonstrate that an ethyl  extract of Bassia longifolia and of Gmelina arborea have anti-inflammatory capacities, indicated by reduced proliferation, inhibition of IL-2 secretion and degranulation capacity of activated human T cells, when compared with adequate concentrations of synthetic positive drug controls. Furthermore, Gmelina arborea improved the wound healing of keratinocytes and fibroblasts and has tendency to increase the secretion of IL-8 by human primary dendritic cells.With this preliminary screening, we offer a scientific basis for the immunomodulatory properties of the two Nepalese medicinal plants Bassia longifolia and Gmelina arborea. However, further detailed studies regarding the responsible compounds are necessary.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Long- and medium-chain fatty acids derived mainly from dietary triglycerides, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbial fermentation of the otherwise indigestible dietary fiber, constitute the major sources of free fatty acids (FFAs) in the metabolic network. Recently, increasing evidence indicates that FFAs serve not only as energy sources but also as natural ligands for a group of orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) termed free fatty acid receptors (FFARs), essentially intertwining metabolism and immunity in multiple ways, such as via  regulation and secretion of peptide hormones. To date, several FFARs that are activated by the FFAs of various chain lengths have been identified and characterized. In particular, FFAR1 (GPR40) and FFAR4 (GPR120) are activated by long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, while FFAR3 (GPR41) and FFAR2 (GPR43) are activated by SCFAs, mainly , butyrate, and propionate. In this review, we discuss the recent reports on the key physiological functions of the FFAR-mediated signaling transduction pathways in the regulation of metabolism and immune responses.

The prostanoid thromboxane (TX)A is a pro-inflammatory mediator implicated in several prostatic diseases, including PCa. TXA signals through the TPα and TPβ isoforms of the T Prostanoid receptor (TP) which exhibit several functional differences and transcriptionally regulated by distinct promoters Prm1 and Prm3, respectively, within the TBXA2R gene. This study examined the expression of TPα and TPβ in inflammatory infiltrates within human prostate tissue. Strikingly, TPβ expression was detected in 94% of infiltrates, including in B- and T-lymphocytes and macrophages. In contrast, TPα was more variably expressed and, where present, expression was mainly confined to macrophages. To gain molecular insight into these findings, expression of TPα and TPβ was evaluated as a function of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation in THP-1 cells. Expression of both TPα and TPβ was upregulated following phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA)-induced differentiation of monocytic THP-1 to their macrophage lineage. Furthermore, FOXP1, an essential transcriptional regulator down-regulated during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, was identified as a key trans-acting factor regulating TPβ expression through Prm3 in THP-1 cells. Knockdown of FOXP1 increased TPβ, but not TPα, expression in THP-1 cells, while genetic reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses established that FOXP1 exerts its repressive effect on TPβ through binding to four cis-elements within Prm3. Collectively, FOXP1 functions as a transcriptional repressor of TPβ in monocytes. This repression is lifted in differentiated macrophages, allowing for upregulation of TPβ expression and possibly accounting for the prominent expression of TPβ in prostate tissue-resident macrophages.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

MPA concentrations were equivalent to those in the serum of women after 6 and 9 months of progestin use. MPA has no effect on the proliferation of PBMCs and CD4+ T cell clones induced by immobilized anti-CD3 antibodies or by antigen (streptokinase). However, MPA decreases production and mRNA expression of IL-5, IL-13, IFN-γ, T-bet, RORC, and IL-17A but increases production and mRNA expression of IL-22 by CD4+ Th22 cell clones and decreases IL-22 production by Th17 cells. MPA inhibits RORC, but not T-bet and AHR, by Th17 cells but increases AHR mRNA and T-bet expression of established CD4+ Th22 cell clones. This suggests that MPA, at concentrations equivalent to those found in the serum of women after treatment for contraception and hormone replacement therapy, can directly inhibit Th1 responses (against intracellular bacteria and viruses), Th17 (against extracellular bacteria and fungi), Th2 (against parasites) but MPA therapy increases IL-22 produced by Th22 cells mediated by an increased expression of AHR and T-bet controlling .

An autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) has been described in American Bulldogs and is caused by a variant in the NIPAL4 gene encoding for the ICHTHYIN protein. So far, this variant has not been described in other breeds. A 1.5-year-old female pedigreed American Bully was referred for generalized scaling and bad coat quality since adoption at 8 weeks of age. Clinical examination, cytological and histopathological examination, and DNA testing were performed. Clinical examination revealed a generalized scaling; cytological evaluation using impression with  tapes showed a secondary Malassezia dermatitis. Histopathological examination revealed a moderate to marked, diffuse, compact orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis with the formation of large scales. Few Malassezia were observed in the stratum corneum associated with minimal mixed perivascular  and moderate epidermal hyperplasia. DNA testing of the dog revealed that he carries two defective alleles of the NIPAL4 gene previously described in the American Bulldog. We performed a commercially available breed detection test which, although not specifically testing for "American Bully" signatures, revealed a high probability of American Bulldog DNA signature within the past three generations. Topical treatment using a combination of keratolytic and keratomodulator shampoo, emollient and moisturizers spray and antimicrobial wipes achieved a marked clinical improvement after only 1 month. Continuous topical treatment was necessary to maintain clinical improvement. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of the deleterious NIPAL4 variant in an American Bully as well as the first description of clinical management and follow-up of ARCI in this breed.© 2019 The Authors.

Several studies have attempted to regenerate the bone for implantation following tooth loss.Maxillary left second molar was extracted from 8-week-old male mice following induction of periodontitis by ligature for 5 days. The extraction socket was treated with 50 ng/µL OAA for 1, 2, and 3 weeks. Detailed morphological changes were examined using Masson's trichrome staining, and the precise localization patterns of various signaling molecules, including CD31, F4/80, interleukin (IL)-6, and osteocalcin, were observed. The volume of bone formation was examined by Micro-CT. Osteoclasts were enumerated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. For molecular dissection of signaling molecules, we employed the hanging-drop in vitro cultivation method at E14 for 1 day and examined the expression pattern of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily and Wnt signaling genes.Histomorphometrical examinations showed facilitated bone formation in the extraction socket following OAA treatment. In addition, OAA-treated specimens showed the altered localization patterns of inflammatory and bone formation-related signaling molecules including CD31, F4/80, IL-6, and osteocalcin. Also, embryonic tooth germ mesenchymal tissue cultivation with OAA treatment showed the significant altered expression patterns of signaling molecules such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily and Wnt signaling.Oleanolic acid  induces bone formation and remodeling through proper modulation of osteoblast, osteoclast, and  with regulations of TGF-β and Wnt signaling.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The present study focused on evaluation of the chemical and pharmacological profile of coumarins from peels of  against . The extracts and phytochemicals from peels of  were prepared, and anti-inflammatory activities were carried out  and , including inhibiting xylene-induced ear edema and carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice and the production of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1β, prostaglandin 2, and tumor-necrosis factor α) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Results indicated that methanolic extract, ethyl  fraction, and four major coumarins (compounds , , , and ) inhibited swelling induced by xylene and carrageenan, separately, . Furthermore, 18 coumarins inhibited inflammatory factor secretion in macrophages primed by LPS, in which compounds , , , ,  showed the most pronounced change, which were comparable to dexamethasone. In summary, peel of  showed an anti-inflammatory effect and coumarin compounds were responsible for regulating inflammatory mediators and cytokines, which might provide a novel nutritional strategy for inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051508>Using metabolic profiling and gene expression analyses to explore molecular effects of replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat-a randomized controlled dietary intervention study.</a></h2><p>Replacing dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) reduces the plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and subsequently the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, beyond changes in LDL cholesterol, we lack a complete understanding of the physiologic alterations that occur when improving dietary fat quality.The aim of this study was to gain knowledge of metabolic alterations paralleling improvements in the fat quality of the diet.We recently conducted an 8-wk, double-blind, randomized controlled trial replacing SFAs with PUFAs in healthy subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia (n = 99). In the present substudy, we performed comprehensive metabolic profiling with multiple platforms (both nuclear magnetic resonance- and mass spectrometry-based technology) (n = 99), and analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression (n = 95) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.A large number of lipoprotein subclasses, myristoylcarnitine and palmitoylcarnitine, and kynurenine were reduced when SFAs were replaced with PUFAs. In contrast, bile acids, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, , and acetoacetate were increased by the intervention. Some amino acids were also altered by the intervention. The mRNA levels of LXRA and LDLR were increased, in addition to several liver X receptor α target genes and genes involved in , whereas the mRNA levels of UCP2 and PPARD were decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after replacing SFAs with PUFAs. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that the 30 most important variables that contributed to class separation spanned all classes of biomarkers, and was in accordance with the univariate analysis.Applying metabolomics in randomized controlled dietary intervention trials has the potential to extend our knowledge of the biological and molecular effects of dietary fat quality.

This symptom is treated with steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which can cause severe side effects when used as long-term treatments. Natural products are an alternative source of new compounds with anti-inflammatory activity. Jefea gnaphalioides (Astereaceae) (A. Gray) is a plant species used to treat inflammatory problems, in Mexico. This study determined the anti-inflammatory activity and the composition of the methanol extract of Jefea gnaphalioides (MEJG).The extract was obtained by heating the plant in methanol at boiling point for 4 h, and then the solvent was evaporated under vacuum (MEJG). The derivatization of the extract was performed using Bis-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide, and the composition was determined by GC-MS. Total Phenols and flavonoids were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu AlCl reaction respectively. The antioxidant activity of MEJG was determined by DPPH method. The acute and chronic anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated on a mouse ear edema induced with 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA). Acute oral toxicity was tested in mice at doses of MEJG of 5000, 2500 and 1250 mg/kg. The levels of NO, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were determinate in J774A.1 macrophages stimulated by Lipopolysaccharide. The production of inflammatory interleukins was measured using commercial kits, and nitric oxide was measured by the Griess reaction.The anti-inflammatory activity of MEJG in acute TPA-induced ear edema was 80.7 ± 2.8%. This result was similar to the value obtained with indomethacin (IND) at the same dose (74.3 ± 2.8%). In chronic TPA-induced edema at doses of 200 mg/kg, the inhibition was 45.7%, which was similar to that obtained with IND (47.4%). MEJG have not toxic effects even at a dose of 5000 mg/kg. MEJG at 25, 50, 100 and 200 μg/mL decreased NO, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 production in macrophages stimulated with LPS. The major compounds in MEJG were α-D-Glucopyranose (6.71%), Palmitic acid (5.59%), D-(+)-Trehalose (11.91%), Quininic acid (4.29%) and Aucubin (1.17%). Total phenolic content was 57.01 mg GAE/g and total flavonoid content was 35.26 mg QE/g MEJG had antioxidant activity.MEJG has anti-inflammatory activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31025504>Observation of Granulocyte Adsorption in Adacolumn Cellulose  Beads after Granulocytapheresis.</a></h2><p>Adacolumn is a therapeutic mode for ulcerative colitis that achieves therapeutic efficacy through the adhesion of leukocytes to cellulose  beads. We used scanning electron microscopy and observed leukocyte adsorption on Adacolumn beads after granulocytapheresis/granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis. We then compared results between two patients with a low and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels to determine whether adhesion is affected by a difference in leukocyte activity depending on the level of . We found that the surface layers of the beads from both patients were covered by a clay-like layer, and spherical granulocytes were adsorbed here and there on top of it. In cross-section the adsorbed granulocytes were visible in the clay-like layer and the surface layer alike. The clay-like layer had a maximum thickness of approximately 12 μm in the low CRP patient and approximately 50 μm in the high CRP patient, so in the high CRP patient the clay-like adsorption layer was thicker. Taken together, adsorption onto beads is considered to involve an immunological mechanism. Our findings suggest that granulocytes contact and adhere to each other at the surface layer after adsorption, and that granulocyte-granulocyte adhesion is enhanced by a higher inflammatory response.© 2019 International Society for Apheresis, Japanese Society for Apheresis, and Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660940>Anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities of the extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents isolated from Luehea ochrophylla Mart.</a></h2><p>Stem bark of Luehea ochrophylla (L. ochrophylla) is used by the traditional Brazilian medicine for treatment of rheumatic diseases and tumors. This study aimed to investigate inhibition of acute and chronic inflammations and cytotoxic activity of extracts, fractions, and isolated compounds from L. ochrophylla.Hexane (HE) and ethanol (EE) extracts obtained from stem bark of L. ochrophylla were submitted to chromatographic fractionation. In order to test acute , experimental model of impact injury was used, followed by transdermal application of gels using phonophoresis. Histological analysis was based on scores assigned by the capacity of decreasing the lesion. To evaluate the effect EE and fractions on cell proliferation, human lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and analyzed using flow cytometry. Proliferation was measured using VPD 450 staining and the calculated proliferative index (PI). The cytotoxic activity was evaluated using MTT colorimetric method against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, HCT-116, and Vero cells. GraphPad Prism Version 5 was used for statistical analysis.HE and EE provided friedelin, β-friedelinol, lupeol, mixture of lupeol and pseudotaraxasterol, β-sitosterol, betulinic acid, mixture of lupeol and taraxasterol, (-)-epicatechin, β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, and (+)-epicatechin-(4β-8)-epicatechin. HE, ethyl  fraction (AF), betulinic acid, and β-sitosterol promoted regeneration of muscle fibers caused by muscle injury. AF significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the lymphocyte proliferation index (1.36 for cultures stimulated with PHA, 0.7 for untreated cultures and 0.12 for cultures stimulated with PHA and treated with AF 25 μg/mL and AF 50 μg/mL, respectively). β-Sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside exhibited high cytotoxic activity (IC = 1.279 μg/mL) against HCT-116 cell line.These results suggest that extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla decreases inflammatory processes generated by muscle injury. The anti-inflammatory activity may be justified by high inhibition of T cell proliferation. These extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla may be useful as a therapeutic agent against rheumatic diseases.

This work illustrates that  is capable of enhancing the intestinal mucus layer and goblet cell function via upregulation of gene expression and autophagy signaling pathways, with a net increase in mucin production. Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered epithelium. In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the epithelium. Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with  and colitis in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood. Using a combination of gnotobiotic mice and mucus-secreting cell lines, we have identified a human-derived microbe, , which adheres to intestinal mucus and secretes metabolites that upregulate the major mucin MUC2 and modulate goblet cell function. Unlike other  species,  does not extensively degrade mucin glycans and cannot grow on mucin alone.

All patients were resuscitated with sodium  ringer solution after admission. According to the difference of mean arterial pressure (MAP) target, the patients were divided into low MAP (60 mmHg ≤ MAP < 65 mmHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), middle MAP (65 mmHg ≤ MAP < 70 mmHg) and high MAP (70 mmHg ≤ MAP < 75 mmHg) groups by random number table using the admission order with 20 patients in each group. Those who failed to reach the target MAP after 30-minute resuscitation were excluded and supplementary cases were deferred. The restrictive fluid resuscitation phase was divided into three phases: before fluid resuscitation, liquid resuscitation for 30 minutes and 60 minutes. The most suitable resuscitation blood pressure level was further speculated by monitoring the inflammatory markers and hemodynamics in different periods in each group of patients. Pearson correlation analysis was used to detect the correlation of variables.Before fluid resuscitation, there was no significant difference in hemodynamics or expressions of serum cytokines among the three groups. Three groups of patients were resuscitated for 30 minutes to achieve the target blood pressure level and maintain 30 minutes. With the prolongation of fluid resuscitation time, the central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) were increased slowly in the three groups, and reached a steady state at about 30 minutes after resuscitation, especially in the high MAP group and the middle MAP group. The expressions of serum inflammatory factors in the three groups were gradually increased with the prolongation of fluid resuscitation time. Compared with the low MAP group and the high MAP group, after 30 minutes of resuscitation the middle MAP group was superior to the other two groups in inhibiting the expressions of pro-inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and promoting anti-inflammatory factors IL-10 [TNF-α mRNA (2): 0.21±0.13 vs. 0.69±0.34, 0.57±0.35; IL-6 mRNA (2): 0.35±0.31 vs. 0.72±0.39, 0.59±0.42; IL-10 mRNA (2): 1.25±0.81 vs. 0.61±0.46, 0.82±0.53; all P < 0.05], but there was no significant difference in promoting the expression of IL-4 mRNA among three groups. At 60 minutes of resuscitation, compared with the low MAP group and the high MAP group, the middle MAP group could significantly inhibit the expressions of TNF-α, IL-6 and promote IL-10 [TNF-α mRNA (2): 0.72±0.35 vs. 1.05±0.54, 1.03±0.49; IL-6 mRNA (2): 0.57±0.50 vs. 1.27±0.72, 1.01±0.64; IL-10 mRNA (2): 1.41±0.90 vs. 0.81±0.48, 0.94±0.61; all P < 0.05]. Compared with the high MAP group, the middle MAP group had significant differences in promoting the expression of IL-4 mRNA (2: 1.32±0.62 vs. 0.91±0.60, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in serum cytokine expressions at different time points of resuscitation between the low MAP group and the high MAP group (all P > 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that there was a strong linear correlation between MAP and mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 in the middle MAP group (r value was 0.766, 0.719, 0.692, respectively, all P < 0.01), but had no correlation with IL-4 (r = 0.361, P = 0.059). Fitting linear regression analysis showed an increase in 1 mmHg per MAP, the expression of TNF-α mRNA increased by 0.027 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.023-0.031, P < 0.001], IL-6 mRNA increased by 0.021 (95%CI = 0.017-0.024, P < 0.001), and IL-10 mRNA increased by 0.049 (95%CI = 0.041-0.058, P < 0.001).When patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock received restrict fluid resuscitation at MAP of 65-70 mmHg, the effect of reducing systemic inflammatory response and improving hemodynamics is better than the target MAP at 60-65 mmHg or 70-75 mmHg. It is suggested that 65-70 mmHg may be an ideal target MAP level for restrictive fluid resuscitation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775453>Analysis of pH Dose-dependent Growth of Sulfate-reducing Bacteria.</a></h2><p>Lower intraluminal colonic pH is an indication for the development of inflammatory bowel disease including active ulcerative colitis. Involvement of intestinal sulfate-reducing bacteria in decreasing bowel pH by the production of HS and  as well as their sensitivity has never been reported before. The study of the relative pH and survival of  Vib-7 by monitoring sulfate reduction parameters was the aim of this work. Monitoring was done through the measurement of bacterial growth (biomass), dissimilatory sulfate reduction parameters: sulfate consumption, lactate oxidation, hydrogen sulfide and  production. According to our results, we observed that lower pH (<5) significantly inhibited  Vib-7 growth. This inhibition was also noticed when alkaline media (>9 pH) was used, though the reduction was not at the rate as in media with pH of 4. The research indicates that the growth of  Vib-7 is inhibited at pH of 4 which is not as low as the pH found in people with severely developed inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis.

Xiexin Tang (XXT), a compound recipe composed of Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.), has been reported to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, but its mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study found that Xiexin Tang markedly ameliorated the composition of the gut microbiota, especially for some short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria, and then notably increased SCFAs production. However, the mechanism of XXT on the fermentation of gut bacteria and further improvement of obesity is not yet clear.This study aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of XXT on the amelioration of obesity.Here, high-fat diet-induced obese rat model was established to investigate the intervention efficacy following oral administration of XXT. Additionally, the expressions of key enzymes of gut microbe-derived SCFAs biosynthesis and key targets in the signaling pathway of energy metabolism were investigated by ELISA and qPCR analysis.Results showed that XXT could notably correct lipid metabolism disorders, alleviate systematic , improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Additionally, XXT could increase gut microbiota-derived SCFAs-producing capacity by enhancing mRNA levels and activities of SCFA-synthetic key enzymes such as  kinase (ACK), methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD), butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase (BUT) and butyrate kinase (BUK), which markedly decreased the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, elevated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and further lowered the energy charge (EC) in obese rats via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)/uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) signaling pathway. What's more, XXT could notably ameliorate dyslipidemia via increasing the gene expression of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.Taken together, our data provided a novel insight into the role of XXT in losing weight from energy metabolism regulation, which unraveled the molecular mechanism of XXT on the alleviation of dyslipidemia and fat heterotopic accumulation. The study provided useful information for XXT in clinical application to treat obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, saturated FAs such as palmitic acid (PA) induce inflammatory signals in macrophages, whereas polyunsaturated FAs, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been related to anti-inflammatory effects. Several studies have suggested a role of fatty acids on DNA methylation, epigenetically regulating gene expression in  processes. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of PA and DHA on the -related genes on human macrophages. In addition, a second aim was to study the epigenetic mechanism underlying the effect of FAs on the inflammatory response. For these purposes, human acute monocytic leukaemia cells (THP-1) were differentiated into macrophages with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA), followed by an incubation with PA or DHA. At the end of the experiment, mRNA expression, protein secretion, and CpG methylation of the following inflammatory genes were analysed: interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1) and interleukin 18 (IL18). The results showed that the treatment with PA increased IL-18 and TNF-α production. Contrariwise, the supplementation with DHA reduced IL-18, TNF-α and PAI-1 secretion by macrophages. However, the incubation with these fatty acids did not apparently modify the DNA methylation status of the investigated genes in the screened CpG sites. This research reveals that PA induces important pro-inflammatory markers in human macrophages, whereas DHA decreases the inflammatory response. Apparently, DNA methylation is not directly involved in the fatty acid-mediated regulation of the expression of these -related genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337751> attenuates inflammasome activation through GPR43-mediated Ca-dependent NLRP3 ubiquitination.</a></h2><p> has been indicated to be elevated and to regulate  in inflammatory and metabolic diseases. The inflammasome serves as a key component of immune homeostasis, and its dysregulation can lead to various inflammatory disorders.

Here, we demonstrate that  attenuates inflammasome activation via GPR43 in a Ca-dependent manner. Through binding to GPR43,  activates the G subunit and subsequent phospholipase C-IP signaling to decrease Ca mobilization. In addition,  activates soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), promotes NLRP3 inflammasome ubiquitination by PKA, and ultimately induces NLRP3 degradation through autophagy.

Moreover, lipid profile, mediators of , and parameters that affect bone formation were determined in the serum and western blot assay, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was done for the estimation of protein expression in the bone tissues. Moreover, cytotoxic effect of cimiracemate A on bone marrow macrophages and bone marrow stromal cells was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.Result of the investigation suggests that treatment with cimiracemate A ameliorates the microarchitecture of bone and histopathological changes in the glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis rat. Level of lipid and mediators of  was significantly reduced in the serum of cimiracemate A-treated rats than the negative control group. However, the activity of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and the level of collagen type I fragments in the serum were found to be reduced, and osteocalcin level was enhanced in cimiracemate A-treated rats than the negative control group. Moreover, treatment with cimiracemate A attenuates the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL), receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B (RANK), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) protein in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis rats.In conclusion, our study suggests that cimiracemate A protects the glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis by regulating the RANKL/RANK/OPG signaling pathway.© 2019 S.

However, therapy response may be less than optimal due to demyelination and axonal damage caused by myeloid cells. Purpose To determine if myeloperoxidase (MPO) molecular MRI can evaluate whether combination therapy targeting both lymphoid and myeloid  can improve autoimmune neuroinflammation compared with either drug alone, even at suboptimal doses. Materials and Methods Four groups of 94 female mice (8-10 weeks old) were induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) from August 2, 2016, to March 30, 2018, and divided into saline control ( = 22), 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH) therapy group ( = 19), glatiramer  (GA) therapy group ( = 22), and combination therapy group ( = 31). Mice were administered suboptimal doses of ABAH, an irreversible inhibitor of MPO; GA, a first-line multiple sclerosis drug; both ABAH and GA; or saline (control). Mice were imaged with -5-hydroxytryptamide-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate gadolinium (hereafter, MPO-Gd) MRI. One-way analysis of variance, two-way analysis of variance, Kurskal-Wallis, and log-rank tests were used.  < .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Results The combination-treated group showed delayed disease onset (day 11.3 vs day 9.8 for ABAH, day 10.4 for GA, day 9.9 for control;  < .05) and reduced disease severity (clinical score during the acute exacerbation period of 1.8 vs 3.8 for ABAH, 3.1 for GA, 3.9 for control;  < .05). The combination-treated group demonstrated fewer MPO-positive lesions (30.2 vs 73.7 for ABAH, 64.8 for GA, 67.2 for control;  < .05), smaller MPO-positive lesion volume (16.7 mm vs 65.2 mm for ABAH, 69.9 mm for GA, 66.0 mm for control;  < .05), and lower intensity of MPO-Gd lesion activation ratio (0.7 vs 1.9 for ABAH, 3.2 for GA, 2.3 for control;  < .05). Reduced disease severity in the combination group was confirmed at histopathologic analysis, where MPO expression (1779 vs 2673 for ABAH, 2898 for GA;  < .05) and demyelination (5.3% vs 9.0% for ABAH, 10.6% for GA;  < .05) were ameliorated. Conclusion Myeloperoxidase molecular MRI can track the treatment response from immunomodulatory drugs even if the drug does not directly target myeloperoxidase, and establishes that combination therapy targeting both myeloid and lymphocytic  is effective for murine autoimmune neuroinflammation, even at suboptimal doses.© RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by Walczak in this issue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30976816>Ursolic acid downregulates thymic stromal lymphopoietin through the blockade of intracellular calcium/caspase‑1/NF‑κB signaling cascade in HMC‑1 cells.</a></h2><p>Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) plays an important role in allergic disorders, including atopic dermatitis and asthma. Ursolic acid (UA) has various pharmacological properties, such as antioxidant, anti‑inflammatory and anticancer. However, the effect of UA on TSLP regulation has not been fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to analyze how UA regulates the production of TSLP in the human mast cell line HMC‑1. Enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, western blotting, caspase‑1 assay and fluorescent measurements of intracellular calcium levels were conducted to analyze the regulatory effects of UA. The results revealed that UA inhibited TSLP production and mRNA expression. In addition, UA reduced the activation of nuclear factor‑κB and degradation of IκBα. Caspase‑1 activity was increased by exposure to phorbol myristate  plus calcium ionophore, whereas it was reduced by UA. Finally, UA treatment prevented an increase in intracellular calcium levels.

Twenty-eight male Wistar albino rats were divided into four equal groups ( = 7) and treated as follows: the control group was injected with physiological saline (0.9% NaCl); the CoQ group was injected with CoQ (10 mg/kg); PbAc group was injected with PbAc (20 mg/kg); PbAc + CoQ group was injected first with PbAc, and after 1 h with CoQ. All groups were injected intraperitoneally for seven days. PbAc significantly increased cortical lipid peroxidation, nitrate/nitrite levels, and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and decreased glutathione content, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase activity and mRNA expression, as well as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and homoxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. PbAc also promoted the secretion of interleukin-1ß and tumor necrosis factor-α, inhibited interleukin-10 production, triggered the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, and suppressed anti-apoptotic proteins. Additionally, PbAc increased the cortical levels of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate, and decreased the level of ATP. However, treatment with CoQ rescued cortical neurons from PbAc-induced neurotoxicity by restoring the balance between oxidants and antioxidants, activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, suppressing , inhibiting the apoptotic cascade, and modulating cortical neurotransmission and energy metabolism. Altogether, our findings indicate that CoQ has beneficial effects against PbAc-induced neuronal damage through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuromodulatory activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31066606>Cyanidin 3-Rutinoside, an Anthocyanin Pigment of  Baill, Inhibits Allergic .</a></h2><p>The occurrence of allergy-mediated inflammatory diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis have increased, but comprehensive treatment remains difficult. Previous studies have shown that  Baill has antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antitumorigenic effects. Cyanidin 3-rutinoside (CR) is the major anthocyanin pigment of . However, the biological effects of CR have been rarely studied to date. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory effects of CR on phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA)/A23187-induced allergic  . CR inhibited the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-, and it also suppressed the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B. These results show that CR ameliorated PMA/A23187-induced allergic  via the suppression of inflammatory cytokines in HMC-1 cells.

Patients were stratified according to the upper limit of the normal RDW range, measured within 1 month before starting treatment. Relationships between RDW levels and the best prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, PSA progression-free survival, and overall survival were examined.Forty-nine patients were treated with abiraterone  in combination with corticosteroid and 104 with enzalutamide. The median RDW was 13.7% (interquartile range, 13.0-14.9). High RDW was significantly associated with prior use of docetaxel (P < .001), presence of lymph node metastasis (P = .031), presence of visceral metastasis (P = .001), and low hemoglobin (P < .001), low albumin (P = .016), and high C-reactive protein levels (P = .02). In a multiple linear regression model, there was a statistically significant negative association between RDW levels and the best PSA response (P = .046). In addition, multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that high RDW was an independent predictor of both shorter PSA progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.27; P = .037) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-5.98; P = .022), showing statistical significance.High RDW is an independent predictor of worse treatment outcomes in patients with CRPC treated with ARATs. RDW could be a readily available and inexpensive biomarker for predicting primary resistance to ARATs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Among these compounds, the effects of alkaloids, such as matrine and oxymatrine, were extensively studied and developed into new drugs. S. alopecuroides and its active components had a wide range of pharmacological activities, such as anticancer, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, analgesic, and neuroprotective functions, as well as protective properties against pulmonary fibrosis and cardiac fibroblast proliferation.As an important traditional Chinese medicine, modern pharmacological studies have demonstrated that S. alopecuroides has prominent bioactivities, especially on gynecological  and hepatitis B, and anticancer activities. These activities provide prospects for novel drug development for cancer and some chronic diseases. Nevertheless, the comprehensive evaluation, quality control, understanding of the multitarget network pharmacology, long-term in vivo toxicity, and clinical efficacy of S. alopecuroides require further detailed research.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, hardly any research has been carried out about it. The present study aimed to evaluate the toxicity in vivo and in vitro. Toxicity was observed by the evaluation of mice weight loss and histopathological changes in the liver. Then, the comparison research between ethyl  extract (EAE) and n-butanol extract (BUE) suggested that liver toxicity was mainly induced by BUE. The mechanical study suggested that BUE-induced liver toxicity was closely associated with necrosis detected by MTT and propidium iodide (PI) staining, via releasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reducing the fluidity, and increasing the permeability of the cell membrane. Western blot analysis confirmed that the necrosis occurred molecularly by the up-regulation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) and receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3), as well as the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa-gene binding (NF-κB) signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro. This finding indicated that the liver toxicity induced by BUE from  was mainly caused by necrosis, which provides an important theoretical support for further evaluation of the safety of this folk medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315726>[Influences of estrogen-related receptor α on pulmonary vascular endothelium of rats undergoing sepsis].</a></h2><p>To investigate influences of estrogen-related receptor α(ERRα) on pulmonary vascular endothelium of rats undergoing sepsis.Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into four groups according to the random number table method (12 in each group): normal control group (NC group), sham operation group (Sham group), sepsis model caused by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) group (CLP group), XCT790 intervention group (XCT790 group, given the XCT790 2.5 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection 30 minutes before CLP).

Several pharmacological activities of natural components and crude extracts from  have been reported including anti-; however, the underlying mechanism is not clear. Phorbol-12-myristate 13--differentiated THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells were used as a reliable model in this study to examine the effect on inflammasome signaling pathway by PA-F4, an extract from . PA-F4 inhibited ATP-induced release of caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 from lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-primed cells. PA-F4 induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of both ASC dimerization and oligomerization in cells under LPS priming plus ATP stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitation of NLRP3 and ASC demonstrated that PA-F4 significantly blunted the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC. Furthermore, PA-F4 completely abolished ATP-induced K efflux reaction in LPS-primed cells. Taken together, PA-F4 displayed an inhibitory activity on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, PA-F4 also inhibited LPS-induced p65 NF-κB activation, suggesting an inhibitory activity on LPS priming step. Further identification showed that rosmarinic acid, cirsimaritin, salvigenin, and carvacrol, four constituents in PA-F4, inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 release. In contrast, rosmarinic acid, cirsimaritin and carvacrol but not salvigenin inhibited ATP-induced caspase-1 release from LPS-primed cells. In conclusion, PA-F4 displayed an inhibitory activity on activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. PA-F4 inhibited LPS priming step through block of p65 NF-κB activation. It also inhibited ATP-induced signaling pathways in LPS-primed cells including the inhibition of both ASC dimerization and oligomerization, K efflux reaction, and the release reaction of caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18.

A previous study has shown that A20 expression levels are down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). However, the precise role of A20 in reducing autoimmune disorders needs to be further elucidated. In this study, A20 expression was found to be preferentially reduced on circulating CD56 natural killer (NK) cells in patients with AS, and its level was negatively correlated with that of proinflammatory cytokines. Further investigation demonstrated that A20 reduces interferon (IFN)-γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α production in CD56 NK cells after stimulation with monokines or phorbol myristate  (PMA)/ionomycin(P/I). Furthermore, CD56 NK cells isolated from AS patients promote TNF-α secretion by autologous monocytes, and increasing the A20 expression level partially attenuates this process. More importantly, decreased A20 expression on circulating CD56 NK cells is associated with worse disease status in patients with AS. Our findings reveal that A20 participates in the pathogenesis of AS by negatively regulating CD56 NK cells and that its reduced expression contributes to a worsened disease status in patients with AS.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31223486>Selective inhibition of histone deacetylase 8 improves vascular hypertrophy, relaxation, and  in angiotensin II hypertensive mice.</a></h2><p>The dysregulation of histone deacetylase (HDAC) protein expression or its enzyme activity is implicated in a variety of diseases. Cardiac HDAC6 and HDAC8 enzyme activity induced by deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA) hypertension was attenuated by sodium valproate, a pan-HDAC inhibitor. However, the HDAC6-selective inhibitor, tubastatin A, did not attenuate angiotensin II-induced hypertension. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether PCI34051, an HDAC8-selective inhibitor, can modulate angiotensin II-induced hypertension and its regulatory mechanism.An angiotensin II-regulated mouse model was used in this study. Animals received vehicle or PCI34051 (3 mg·kg - ·day- ) via intraperitoneal injection. Systolic blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method. Blood vessel thickness was measured following hematoxylin and eosin staining, VCAM-1 immunohistochemistry was performed in the aortas, and mRNA expression of renin-angiotensin system components,  markers, and NADPH oxidase (Nox) was determined by RT-PCR. The effect of PCI34051 on vasorelaxation was studied in rat aortic rings, and its effect on nitric oxide (NO) production was determined using DAF-FM DA, a fluorescent dye, in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs).PCI34051 administration reduced systolic blood pressure via downregulation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) mRNA expression. PCI34051 treatment attenuated vascular hypertrophy by decreasing E2F3 and GATA6 mRNA expression. Vascular relaxation after PCI34051 treatment was more dependent on vascular endothelial cells and it was blocked by an NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor. In addition, NO production increased in HUVECs after PCI34051 treatment; this was decreased by the NOS inhibitor. The expression of inflammatory molecules and adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 decreased in the aortas of angiotensin II-infused mice after PCI34051 administration. However, PCI34051 did not affect Nox or its regulatory subunits.PCI34051 lowered high blood pressure through modulation of arterial remodeling, vasoconstriction, and  in an angiotensin II-induced hypertension model.

Recent reports associated with the health promoting properties of PMFs in citrus fruits have dramatically increased. However, the limiting factor in animal and human study of PMFs is still the supply of pure PMFs, such as tangeretin, nobiletin, sinensetin and 3,5,6,7,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone. Herein, we introduce the newly developed efficient separation method using high-performance counter-current chromatography (HPCCC) in isolating multiple pure single PMFs simultaneously in one cycle process. With the smallest preparation loop on the semi-preparative HPCCC instrument, the optimized solvent system of hexanes/ethyl /methanol/water resulted in the isolation of pure sinensetin, tangeretin, nobiletin, 3,5,6,7,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone, 5,6,7,4'-tetramethoxyflavone and 3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone directly from crude sweet orange peel extract in one cycle of separation process by HPCCC in the mode of reverse phase. The purity of each of the six isolated PMFs is greater than 96.6% analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. Scale-up and high purity of individual PMFs can be separated by using a large separation loop in preparative HPCCC model. The renovated HPCCC methodology can be practically used in natural product isolation and consequent biological property evaluation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There are conflicting data on the effect of HCs on mucosal susceptibility to HIV-1. The objective of this study was to evaluate cervicovaginal (CV) mucosal data from healthy women before and after initiation of either oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) or depot medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA) injection. CONRAD A10-114 was a prospective, open-label, parallel cohort study. We enrolled 74 women and 62 completed the visits (32 and 30 who selected OCPs and DMPA, respectively). Participants provided CV lavage, vaginal biopsies, and CV swabs at baseline in the luteal phase and then ∼6 weeks after initiating HCs. After contraceptive initiation, there were significant increases in vaginal immune cell density among both DMPA and OCP users. Changes for OCP users were concentrated in the subepithelial lamina propria, whereas for DMPA users, they were distributed throughout the vaginal tissue, including the epithelium (CD45, CD3, CD4, and CD1a). Contraceptive use altered concentrations of soluble CV inflammatory and immune mediators, with significant reductions in some proinflammatory cytokines and secretory leukoprotease inhibitor. Compared with baseline, p24 antigen production after  HIV-1 infection of vaginal biopsies doubled after DMPA use, but all -values were >.05. HIV-1 replication was significantly higher in DMPA-exposed tissues compared with those from the OCP group at the end of the tissue culture ( = .01). Although not statistically significant, median  inhibition of HIV-1 by CV fluid (innate antiviral activity), was reduced by ∼50% with HCs ( > .21). Exposure to exogenous contraceptive hormones significantly increased vaginal immune cells and reduced CV proinflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides.

The blood sample was taken for the assessment of renal and hepatic-functional variables like serum creatinine, blood urea, BUN and SGPT, SGOT, and total serum bilirubin. Hematological parameters were also examined. Histological examination has been done on kidneys and liver. Alterations of the body weight and the organ's weight were documented. Treatment with stevia and valsartan significantly decreased serum creatinine levels. A reduction of liver enzymes, and total serum bilirubin levels were observed in all the treatment groups. Treatment with valsartan and amlodipine, remarkably and stevia, mildly reduced the renal tissue damage, , and tubular necrosis. However, the present study demonstrated that losartan treatment aggravated kidney damage by increasing protein cast, calcification, tubular necrosis, and injury.

The suspended cells underwent a series of fixation/embedding protocols and were stained with uranyl  and an Ir-based DNA intercalator. A priori, laboratory-based absorption micro-computed tomography (μ-CT) was applied to acquire a reference frame of the morphology of the cells and their spatial distribution before sectioning. After CT analysis, a trimmed 300 × 300 × 300 μm block was sectioned into a sequential series of 132 sections with a thickness of 2 μm, which were subjected to LA-ICP-MS imaging. A pixel acquisition rate of 250 pixels s was achieved, through a bidirectional scanning strategy. After acquisition, the two-dimensional elemental images were reconstructed using the timestamps in the laser log file. The synchronization of the data required an improved optimization algorithm, which forces the pixels of scans in different ablation directions to be spatially coherent in the direction orthogonal to the scan direction. The volume was reconstructed using multiple registration approaches. Registration using the section outline itself as a fiducial marker resulted into a volume which was in good agreement with the morphology visualized in the μ-CT volume. The 3D μ-CT volume could be registered to the LA-ICP-MS volume, consisting of 2.9 × 10 voxels, and the nucleus dimensions in 3D space could be derived.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30800000>Maresin1 Alleviates Metabolic Dysfunction in Septic Mice: A H NMR-Based Metabolomics Analysis.</a></h2><p>Maresin1 (MaR1), a new anti-inflammatory and proresolving lipid mediator, has been proven to exert organ-protective effects in septic animal models.

Inflammatory reactions after surgical interventions distant from the vascularised limbus and without opening of the anterior chamber of the eye are usually very muted, because of the corneal immune and angiogenic privilege. A milestone in the therapy and prophylaxis of  after corneal surgery has been the use of topical glucocorticoids since the 1950s. When these are used, it is important to consider the cataractogenic effect of long-term use, the possibility of steroid-induced increase in intraocular pressure (so-called steroid response), the increased risk for microbial infection and the inhibition of epithelialisation. The available glucocorticoids differ in their ability to penetrate into the eye (prednisolone best), their immunosuppressive activity (dexamethasone best) and their ability to induce a steroid response (loteprednol etabonate and fluorometholone least). Preservative-free formulations are only available for dexamethasone. The different properties must be taken into account when choosing the "best" glucocorticoid: If there is a risk of delay in epithelialisation of the wound, topical steroids should be avoided or if necessary, phosphate- and preservative-free dexamethasone should be used with caution. If efficiency in the posterior cornea or in the anterior chamber is important, e.g. after penetrating keratoplasty, prednisolone  should be used. If a steroid response is known, loteprednol etabonate or fluorometholone should be used. When allogeneic tissue is transplanted, long-term topical glucocorticoid use over 24 months or longer is necessary. After high-risk keratoplasty with allogeneic donor tissue, supplemental systemic immunosuppressive therapy with calcineurin inhibitors or mycophenolate mofetil over 6 to 12 months is recommended.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645126>-Coumaric-Acid-Containing  Ameliorates Acute Lung Injury by Activating AMPK/Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling and Improving the Anti-oxidant Response.</a></h2><p> is a perennial herb belonging to the Compositae family and is widely distributed in the tropical parts of Asia.

Infarct volume, brain pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, microglial/macrophage density, and neurogenesis were monitored during the first week post stroke. Neurological sensorimotor deficit, spatial memory and brain deposits of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were assessed until six weeks post stroke. In diabetic mice with pMCAo, proinflammatory mediators (IL-1β, MCP1, TNFα and CD68) were significantly higher than in non-diabetic mice. In GA-treated mice, the infarct volume was reduced by 30% at D3 and by 40% at D7 post stroke (P < 0.05), sensorimotor recovery was accelerated as early as D3, and long-term memory loss was prevented. Moreover, proinflammatory mediators significantly decreased between D3 (COX2) and D7 (CD32, TNFα, IL-1β), and neurogenesis was significantly increased at D7. Moreover, GA abrogates the accumulation of insoluble Aβ40. This work is the first one to evidence that the immunomodulatory drug GA reduces infarct volume and proinflammatory mediators, enhances early neurogenesis, accelerates sensorimotor recovery, and prevents long-term memory loss in diabetic mice with pMCAo.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the effect of HT-AC on inflammatory response in cardiovascular disease remains unclear. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of HT-AC on the  response of vascular endothelial cells and the related molecular mechanism. Our results showed that HT-AC inhibited the inflammatory response in hypercholesterolemic mice and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-stimulated HUVECs. Meanwhile, HT-AC also up-regulated SIRT6 expression in hypercholesterolemic mice and HUVECs. To further investigate whether SIRT6 is involved in the regulation of endothelial inflammatory response by HT-AC, endothelium-specific Sirt6 knockout (Sirt6) mice were used. Our study found that Sirt6 abolished the inhibition of inflammatory response by HT-AC in the thoracic aorta of hypercholesterolemic mice. In vitro study also showed that knockdown of SIRT6 reduced the inhibition of inflammatory response by HT-AC, whereas overexpression of SIRT6 augmented the inhibition of inflammatory response by HT-AC in HUVECs. Further study demonstrated that HT-AC exerts its anti-inflammatory effect partly via the SIRT6-mediated PKM2 signaling pathway. In addition, HT-AC inhibited TNF-induced inflammatory response through the TNF receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A) signaling pathway. These findings indicate that HT-AC regulates the vascular endothelial inflammatory response partly through the TNFRSF1A/SIRT6/PKM2-mediated signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30945705>Evaluation of the anti-inflammatory properties of the active constituents in Ginkgo biloba for the treatment of pulmonary diseases.</a></h2><p>Ginkgo biloba has long been used in ancient China for the treatment of cough, asthma, and other lung diseases. However, the active constituents in G. biloba for pulmonary disease treatment remain unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory active constituents in G. biloba and clarify their associated molecular mechanisms. The biological effects of different G. biloba extracts were evaluated in an ovalbumin-induced allergic mouse model. Anti-inflammatory compounds were present in the ethyl  phase of the extract, which were analysed by HPLC-MS. Biflavones were identified as the main compounds, which were further evaluated by docking calculations. Leukocyte elastase showed a high fit score with ginkgetin, one of the identified biflavones. The lowest binding free energy was -6.69 kcal mol-1. The effects of biflavones were investigated in vivo and in vitro. Ginkgetin markedly suppressed the abnormal expression of the Akt and p38 pathways in human neutrophil elastase (HNE)-stimulated A549 cells. Biflavones also decreased MUC5AC mRNA expression in HNE-stimulated A549 cells and the allergic mouse model. Inflammatory cells (neutrophils) and cytokines (IL-8) also decreased in mice treated with biflavones. The results suggest that G. biloba biflavones could inhibit the activity of leukocyte elastase. This in turn implicates G. biloba as a functional food for the treatment of airway .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606535>Gastroprotective effects of Erythrina speciosa (Fabaceae) leaves cultivated in Egypt against ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats.</a></h2><p>Members of the genus Erythrina have been traditionally used in the treatment of various ailments such as  and gastrointestinal disorders. Erythrina speciosa (Fabaceae) is a spiny, deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southern America in Brazil. It is cultivated in Africa and Asia. The traditional usage of E. speciosa indicated its antibacterial, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities.Evaluation of the phytochemical constituents, gastroprotective effects and possible mechanism of action of the ethyl  fraction obtained from the methanol extract of E. speciosa leaves (ESLE).Chemical characterization of ESLE was done using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The gastroprotective activity of ESLE was evaluated using ethanol-induced gastric-ulcer model in rats. Rats were pre-treated with ESLE 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg 1 h before the administration of absolute ethanol. Histological analysis, mucin content, and total acidity were evaluated. The possible mechanism of action of ESLE was studied through the examination of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, PGE2, and NF-κB, iNOS, COX-2, and HSP-70 immunoexpression. In vitro, anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of ESLE was also studied using micro-well dilution method.Fourteen compounds were tentatively identified including alkaloids, flavonoids, and saponins. ESLE exerted a powerful gastroprotective effect. The pre-treatment with ESLE at different doses resulted in a significant reduction in gastric lesions and significant elevation in the mucin production. These effects could be partially mediated by the potent anti-inflammatory activity of ESLE as evidenced by the significant reduction in the immunoexpression of NF-κB, COX-2, iNOS and the reduction in the pro-inflammatory marker, TNF-α. ESLE counteracted the ethanol-induced oxidative stress by increasing the levels of depleted GSH and catalase as well as significantly attenuating the ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation tissue levels. In addition, ESLE exhibited in vitro antibacterial activity against H. pylori.The chemical constituents of ESLE strongly support its potent gastroprotective effect suggesting its future potential application in the management of gastric ulcer by eliminating its symptoms and causes including H. pylori.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, acylation and incomplete release of the encapsulated octreotide, as well as acidic degradation product-induced  are the major challenges hampering widespread clinical applications of this delivery system. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel octreotide-delivering system utilizing naturally derived biodegradable material, silk fibroin (SF). Octreotide  was encapsulated in the SF microspheres with a high loading (8-10 wt%) using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-assisted emulsification method. The octreotide-SF microspheres exhibited a silk I structure (low crystallinity) and burst release in in vitro release studies. Ethanol treatment after microsphere formation significantly increased β-sheet and silk II structure (high crystallinity) of the microspheres, significantly reducing the burst release and resulting in zero-order sustained release of octreotide over 102 days, and the data could be fit to the diffusion-driven release model. After the ethanol-treated microspheres were intramuscularly injected into rats at low (2 mg/kg) and high (8 mg/kg) octreotide doses, the plasma concentration of octreotide in the high dose group remained high (>50 pg/mL) at day 28 when compared to that of the control (pure drug at low dose) and low dose microsphere group. Interestingly, the plasma concentration for the high dose group at day 56 dramatically increased to >280 pg/mL observed at day 28. The low dose microsphere group showed a similar increase, but at a much lower level. The rebound octreotide level likely reflected degradation of the SF matrix which released tightly bound/trapped octreotide. Therefore, SF microspheres can deliver octreotide over a long period of time with release kinetics and the mechanism different from PLGA microsphere system.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Hypertension was induced by deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA)-salt administration in uninephrectomized rats for 6 weeks. LXR agonist GW3965 (3-{3-[(2-chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-(2,2-diphenyl-ethyl)-amino]-propoxy}-phenyl)-acetic acid was given for the past week. Rhythmic activity and contractions of the isolated heart tissues were recorded. Biochemical parameters were assessed in ventricular tissue and plasma samples. Cardiac expressions of various proteins were examined, and histopathological evaluation was performed in the left ventricle and liver. GW3965 reduced systolic blood pressure and enhanced noradrenaline-stimulated papillary muscle contraction induced by DOCA-salt + uninephrectomy. Plasma and tissue total antioxidant capacity (TAC) increased and tissue 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) levels decreased in the DOCA-salt group. GW3965 elevated plasma and tissue TAC levels in both of groups. Glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78), phospho-dsRNA-activated-protein kinase-like ER kinase (p-PERK), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and nuclear factor-κB p65 (NF-κB p65) expression was augmented, and inhibitor-κB-α (IκB-α) expression was reduced in hypertensive hearts. The altered levels of all these markers were reversed by GW3965. Also, GW3965 ameliorated DOCA-salt + uninephrectomy-induced cardiac and hepatic  and fibrosis. However, GW3965 unchanged the plasma lipid levels and hepatic balloon degeneration score. These results demonstrated that LXR activation may improve hypertension-induced cardiac changes without undesired effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911221>The Synergistic Role of Diet and Exercise in the Prevention, Pathogenesis, and Management of Ulcerative Colitis: An Underlying Metabolic Mechanism.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a biologically complex condition characterized by chronic, relapsing  of the gastrointestinal tract. The relative incidence of this debilitating condition is increasing and sociologically damaging outcomes are a continued reality. Several etiological theories for UC are currently under investigation, spanning between genetic and environmental determinants. From an environmental perspective, previous literature reviews have demonstrated the independent effectiveness of specific diet and exercise patterns in modifying UC immuno-pathophysiology. This article explores the  role of diet and aerobic exercise in the prevention, pathogenesis, and management of UC in the context of recent immunological research. Through a unifying mechanism-that is, microbial influence of colonic  and immuno-pathophysiology-the simultaneous reduction of pro-inflammatory dietary sulfurous amino acid intake (ie methionine, cysteine, homocysteine, and taurine) and the upregulation of aerobic exercise frequency (which spurs the colonization of anti-inflammatory butyrate, , and propionate producing microbial taxa) demonstrate the clinical efficacy of incorporating both diet and exercise modifications for UC prevention and management through pathogenic alterations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390749>Carnosine Decreases PMA-Induced Oxidative Stress and  in Murine Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Carnosine is an endogenous dipeptide composed of β-alanine and L-histidine. This naturally occurring molecule is present at high concentrations in several mammalian excitable tissues such as muscles and brain, while it can be found at low concentrations in a few invertebrates. Carnosine has been shown to be involved in different cellular defense mechanisms including the inhibition of protein cross-linking, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species detoxification as well as the counteraction of . As a part of the immune response, macrophages are the primary cell type that is activated. These cells play a crucial role in many diseases associated with oxidative stress and , including atherosclerosis, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, carnosine was first tested for its ability to counteract oxidative stress. In our experimental model, represented by RAW 264.7 macrophages challenged with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitors, carnosine was able to decrease the intracellular concentration of superoxide anions (O•) as well as the expression of Nox1 and Nox2 enzyme genes. This carnosine antioxidant activity was accompanied by the attenuation of the PMA-induced Akt phosphorylation, the down-regulation of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNAs, and the up-regulation of the expression of the anti-inflammatory mediators IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β1. Additionally, when carnosine was used at the highest dose (20 mM), there was a generalized amelioration of the macrophage energy state, evaluated through the increase both in the total nucleoside triphosphate concentrations and the sum of the pool of intracellular nicotinic coenzymes. Finally, carnosine was able to decrease the oxidized (NADP)/reduced (NADPH) ratio of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate in a concentration dependent manner, indicating a strong inhibitory effect of this molecule towards the main source of reactive oxygen species in macrophages. Our data suggest a multimodal mechanism of action of carnosine underlying its beneficial effects on macrophage cells under oxidative stress and  conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293526>Composition of the Biofilm Matrix of  Acneic Strain RT5.</a></h2><p>In skin,  (former ) can behave as an opportunistic pathogen, depending on the strain and environmental conditions. Acneic strains of  form biofilms inside skin-gland hollows, inducing  and skin disorders. The essential exogenous products of  accumulate in the extracellular matrix of the biofilm, conferring essential bacterial functions to this structure. However, little is known about the actual composition of the biofilm matrix of . Here, we developed a new technique for the extraction of the biofilm matrix of Gram-positive bacteria without the use of chemical or enzymatic digestion, known to be a source of artifacts. Our method is based on the physical separation of the cells and matrix of sonicated biofilms by ultracentrifugation through a CsCl gradient. Biofilms were grown on the surface of cellulose  filters, and the biomass was collected without contamination by the growth medium. The biofilm matrix of the acneic  RT5 strain appears to consist mainly of polysaccharides. The following is the ratio of the main matrix components: 62.6% polysaccharides, 9.6% proteins, 4.0% DNA, and 23.8% other compounds (porphyrins precursors and other). The chemical structure of the major polysaccharide was determined using a nuclear magnetic resonance technique, the formula being →6)-α-D-Gal-(1→4)-β-D-ManNAc3NAcA-(1→6)-α-D-Glc-(1→4)-β-D-ManNAc3NAcA-(1→3)-β-GalNAc-(1→. We detected 447 proteins in the matrix, of which the most abundant were the chaperonin GroL, the elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G, several enzymes of glycolysis, and proteins of unknown function. The matrix also contained more than 20 hydrolases of various substrata, pathogenicity factors, and many intracellular proteins and enzymes. We also performed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy analysis of the  RT5 matrix for the first time, providing the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) profiles of the  RT5 biofilm matrix and biofilm biomass. The difference between the matrix and biofilm biomass spectra showed successful matrix extraction rather than simply the presence of cell debris after sonication. These data show the complexity of the biofilm matrix composition and should be essential for the development of new anti- biofilms and potential antibiofilm drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659812>Anti-inflammatory properties of fermented pine (Pinus morrisonicola Hay.) needle on lipopolysaccharide-induced  in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells.</a></h2><p>This study was aimed to explore the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of various pine needle products (non-fermented, fermented, and commercial) extracted with different solvents (hexane, ethyl , and water) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced RAW 264.7 cells. The phenolic/flavonoid contents of ethyl  extract of fermented pine needle (EAE-FPN) is higher than other pine product extracts (hexane/water). The levels of antioxidant indices (TEAC, DPPH) as well as free radical scavenging activity (H O ) were significantly improved in EAE-FPN than other pine needle product extracts. The levels of ROS and various inflammatory markers (NO, PGE2, TNF-α, and IL-1β/6) were considerably abolished by EAE-FPN in a dose-dependent manner (50-200 μg/ml). Moreover, the protein expressions of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-κB) p65 subunit were also markedly downregulated by EAE-FPN. Collectively, EAE-FPN with phenolic/flavonoid content showed excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties via modulating NF-κB signaling pathway. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Pine needle drink (Pinus morrisonicola Hay) has been used as a functional beverage for many years due to its various biological properties in Asia especially in Taiwan, China, and Korea. Many researchers hinted various biological activity of fermented pine needle product but none of them explored the in-depth mechanism underpinning its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell model. Hence, the current cell line study was designed to assess the underlying mechanism behind the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of Pine needles extract (both non-fermented and fermented) in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells (macrophage). The outcome of this study distinctly showed that EAE-FPN displayed potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities by regulating NF-κB signaling pathway. Therefore, pine needle could be developed into functional drink to abolish the progression of inflammatory responses in various disease condition.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529418>Adventitious root cultures of Oplopanax elatus inhibit LPS-induced  via suppressing MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Bioreactor-cultured adventitious roots (ARs) of the endangered medicinal plant Oplopanax elatus Nakai is a novel alternative plant material. To utilize ARs in the product production, the present study investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of O. elatus ARs. In the in vivo experiment, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury disease model was established and several inflammatory indexes were determined. For the LPS-stimulated mice, after pretreatment of AR crude extract (200 mg/kg), cell infiltration in lungs was decreased, the production of proinflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-6, and 1β in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was evidently reduced, which indicated that O. elatus ARs had an anti-inflammatory effect. In the in vitro experiment, ethyl  (EtOAc) fractions (12.5, 25, and 50 μg/mL) were used to treat LPS-induced peritoneal macrophages (PMs) of mice. The production of NO, prostaglandin E, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in LPS-stimulated PMs was obviously inhibited (p < 0.05) after pretreatment with EtOAc fractions, and the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase were also suppressed. To clarify the anti-inflammatory mechanism, effects of EtOAc fraction on changes of proteins related to the pathways of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) were investigated. The phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinases, c-jun n-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in LPS-induced PMs was inhibited after pretreatment of EtOAc fractions. In addition, EtOAc fractions enhanced inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B-α expression and decreased nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB. Thus, EtOAc from O. elatus ARs is involved in regulating MAKP and NF-κB signaling pathways to inhibit LPS-induced .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707845>Syzygium aromaticum aqueous extract inhibits human neutrophils myeloperoxidase and protects mice from LPS-induced lung .</a></h2><p>Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & Perry (Myrtaceae), commonly known as clove, originally found in the Muluku Islands in East Indonesia, is widely used as a spice and has numerous medicinal properties.This study investigated the antioxidant potential of S. aromaticum aqueous extract (SAAE) in vitro and its protective effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung  in mice.Neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured by luminol-amplified chemiluminescence. Superoxide anion generation was detected by cytochrome c reduction assay. HO was detected by DCFH fluorescence assay. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was mesured by tetramethyl benzidine oxidation method. To study the anti-inflammatory activity of SAAE, lung  was induced in mice (BALB/c) by intra-tracheal instillation of lypopolysaccharide (5 µg/mouse), and SAAE (200 mg/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally prior to LPS administration. Bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue were collected to assess inflammatory cells count and total protein content. Metalloproteinases activity was detected by zymography technique.SAAE inhibited luminol-amplified chemiluminescence of resting neutrophils and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine- or phorbol myristate -stimulated neutrophils, with an inhibitory effect starting at a concentration as low as 0.5 µg/mL. Moreover, SAAE reduced significantly MPO activity and it exhibits a dose-dependent action (IC = 0.5 µg/mL). In vivo results showed that SAAE decreased markedly neutrophil count (From 61% to 15%) and proteins leakage into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Gelatin zymography assay showed that S. aromaticum inhibited MMP-2 (15%) and MMP-9 (18%) activity in lung homogenates.Our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of SAAE, in vivo, is due to the inhibition of ROS production and metalloproteinases activity via its action on MPO. According to these findings, SAAE could be a potential source of new compounds with anti-inflammatory activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30724050>Immunomodulation of Zerumbone via Decreasing the Production of Reactive Oxygen Species from Immune Cells.</a></h2><p>Zerumbone has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer and anti-hyperglycemic effects but the specific mechanism through which zerumbone exerts its anti-inflammatory action through inhibiting reactive oxygen species was not well studied. Hence, this paper studied the zerumbone capacity to inhibit intracellular and extracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) produced by whole blood cell, polymorphoneutrophil (PMNs) and macrophage cells due to the zymogen and phorbolmyristerate  (PMA) oxidant effect.Zymogen and PMA based chemiluminescence assay were used to determine the immunomodulatory effect of zerumbone at concentrations (100, 10 and 1 μg mL-1) toward production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) from whole blood, PMNs and macrophage.Zerumbone significantly inhibited intracellular and extracellular ROS production by the zymosan/PMA-activated phagocyte cells with IC50 values of (16.3±0.1, 23.7±0.1 and 4.97±0.1 μg mL-1) against whole blood, PMNs and macrophage respectively.The anti-inflammatory activity of zerumbone was so much significant that even strong oxidant (zymogen and PMA) were not able to produce reactive oxygen species when incubated together in phagocytic cells, thus suppress production of ROS.

We hypothesized that neutrophils may exacerbate neuronal injury through the release of neurotoxic quantities of the neurotransmitter glutamate.Real-time glutamate release by primary human neutrophils was determined using enzymatic biosensors. Bacterial and direct protein-kinase C (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-; PMA) activation of neutrophils in human whole blood, isolated neutrophils or human cell lines were compared in the presence/absence of N-Methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonists. Bacterial and direct activation of neutrophils from wild-type and transgenic murine neutrophils deficient in NMDAR-scaffolding proteins were compared using flow cytometry (phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation) and real-time respirometry (oxygen consumption).Both glutamate and the NMDAR co-agonist d-serine are rapidly released by neutrophils in response to bacterial and PMA-induced activation. Pharmacological NMDAR blockade reduced both the autocrine release of glutamate, d-serine and the respiratory burst by activated primary human neutrophils. A highly specific small-molecule inhibitor ZL006 that limits NMDAR-mediated neuronal injury also reduced ROS by activated neutrophils in a murine model of peritonitis, via uncoupling of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit from its' scaffolding protein, postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95). Genetic ablation of PSD-95 reduced ROS production by activated murine neutrophils. Pharmacological blockade of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit reduced primary human neutrophil activation induced by Pseudomonas fluorescens, a glutamate-secreting Gram-negative bacillus closely related to pathogens that cause hospital-acquired infections.These data suggest that release of glutamate by activated neutrophils augments ROS production in an autocrine manner via actions on NMDAR expressed by these cells.

The petroleum ether fraction was saponified and the saponifiable and unsaponifiable fractions were analyzed on GC/MS. The different fractions were subjected to phytochemical investigation to isolate pure compounds. In-vivo anti-inflammatory activity of the ethanolic extract was evaluated using carrageenan induced rat paws edema method at doses of 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg and proved based on histopathological and biochemical parameters.Five known compounds were isolated for the first time from the aerial parts of Combretum aculeatum Vent: quercetin, vitexin, isorhamnetin 3-O-β-glucoside, isovitexin and rutin, in addition to two previously isolated ones: β-sitosterol and its glucoside. The ethanolic extract evidenced in-vivo anti-inflammatory activity by oral intake of 400 mg/kg of the ethanolic extract significantly (P ≥ 0.05) decreased the paw edema (only 32±1.9% increase in paw weight after 4 h) compared to indomethacin (28.6±2.5%). Moreover, it significantly suppressed the serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) and increased the GSH to be 11.76±0.85, 5.13±0.62 μmol/mL and 5.66±0.28 μM/mL, respectively. It diminished the serum cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β levels to be 39.1±1.2, 32.6±1.1 and 37.5±1.2 pg/mL, respectively. Results are accompanied by histopathological examination.Overall, the results herein presented significant anti-inflammatory properties traditionally ascribed to Combretum aculeatum Vent.

Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade  through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH. More studies are needed in humans to elicit the effect of positive airway pressure therapy on gut dysbiosis.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31087717>Evaluation of testis hormonal and histopathological alterations in type I and type II diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Diabetes is a devastating metabolic disease that causes long-term damage to various organs. An important leading complication of diabetes is a degenerative effect on the reproductive system including infertility and gonadal dysfunction. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of experimental type I and II diabetes on the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone.Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four separate groups: (1) type I diabetes (T1DM), (2) type II diabetes (T2DM), (3) cetrorelix -treated nondiabetic control group, and (4) normal untreated group (n = 6). T1DM was experimentally induced by a single injection of alloxan (135 mg/kg) while T2DM was induced by feeding the animals with drinking water enriched with fructose (10%). Cetrorelix  (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal for 1 week) treatment group was used as a positive control. All rats were killed and blood and testes were collected after 8 weeks of the study. The effects of induced diabetes on the levels of blood glucose and insulin were assessed. The levels of sex hormones and insulin were determined by radioimmunoassay. Histological staining was used to check abnormal patterns of testicular morphology, the diameter of seminiferous tubules, testicular diameter, and germinal layer thickness.A significant reduction in the testosterone, FSH, and LH levels were observed in T1DM, T2DM, and also in cetrorelix -treated groups. Analysis of testicular histology sections revealed significantly reduced thickness of cell layer in T1DM and cetrorelix -treated groups compared with the T2DM group. In T2DM, the cell numbers, the thickness of cell layer, the diameter of seminiferous tubules, and weight of testicles were slightly increased. In contrast, total tubules of empty seminiferous increased significantly in T1D and cetrorelix treated groups compared with the control group.Overall, diabetes can induce hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis dysfunction, affects hormonal secretion, and causes histological damage to testes, collectively leading to deleterious effects on male fertility.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825168>Methods for Hyaluronan Molecular Mass Determination by Agarose Gel Electrophoresis.</a></h2><p>The average molecular mass of hyaluronan (HA) in most healthy biological fluids and tissues is usually about 6000-8000 kDa, but the biosynthetic mechanism results in a polydisperse mixture of sizes. Subsequent enzymatic degradation, or the action of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, can further increase polydispersity and decrease the average size. Fragmented HA can be a biomarker of . In addition, reductions in HA size are associated with tissue remodeling and repair processes.

For the first time, we examined the efficacy of different fractions (acetone, hexane, and ethyl ) of  against glioma, cervical, and breast cancer cell lines. As determined by mitochondrial reductase activity assay, the viability of cancer cells was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by the three fractions. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC-50) values after the treatment of C-6 glioma cells for 48 h was found to be 32.97 µg/mL (acetone extract), 40.63 µg/mL (hexane extract), and 51.65 µg/mL (ethyl  extract). Of the three fractions, the acetone fraction was more effective. The long-term colony formation of cancer cells was significantly suppressed by the acetone fraction. Analyses using DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining, AO/PI (acridine orange/propidium iodide) staining, DNA laddering, and sub-G1 population revealed that the acetone extract induced apoptosis in glioma cells. The extract induced reactive oxygen species generation and suppressed the expression of cell survival proteins. The migration of cancer cells was also suppressed by the acetone extract. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis indicated that tetracontane, dotriacontane, hexatriacontane, pentacosane, hexacosane, and eicosane are the major components in the acetone extract.

According to whether cold air stimulation could induce respiratory symptoms such as cough and wheeze, the patients were divided into cold-insensitive group (45 cases) and cold-sensitive group (35 cases). All the patients were treated with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), long-acting β2 receptor agonist (LABA; salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate powder for inhalation, 50 μg/250 μg, twice daily) and montelukast sodium tablets (10 mg, once daily); short-acting β2 receptor agonist (SABA) and/or systemic glucocorticoid (prednisone  tablets, 10 mg, once daily; or injection of methylprednisolone sodium succinate, 40 mg) were given if necessary. Asthma Control Test (ACT) score before treatment and at 3 months of treatment was used to assess the clinical symptoms such as cough and wheeze; spirometry was performed to determine lung function impairment and recovery. Blood and induced sputum cell counts were examined to determine the characteristics of airway .The two groups were comparable for age, gender, BMI, proportion of smokers and allergic rhinitis before treatment. The cold-sensitive patients experienced significantly more frequent acute exacerbations than the cold-insensitive patient within 1 year before the visit ( &lt; 0.05), but the use of SABA and glucocorticoid for symptom control during the treatment did not differ significantly between the two groups ( &gt; 0.05). The ACT scores of the cold-sensitive group were significantly lower than those of the cold-insensitive group both before and after the treatment ( &lt; 0.01). Compared with the cold-insensitive patients, the cold-sensitive patients had more obvious impairment of FEV1/FVC% and FEV1%pred before treatment ( &lt; 0.01), and also showed poorer recovery after treatment ( &lt; 0.05). The percentages of eosinophils in blood and induced sputum samples did not differ significantly between the two groups either before and after the treatment, but the percentage of neutrophils was significantly higher in the cold-sensitive group ( &lt; 0.01). In the induced sputum samples collected before treatment, the cell populations consisted mainly of eosinophilic subtype (60%) and neutrophilic subtype (20%) in the cold-insensitive group; in the cold-sensitive patients, the sputum neutrophilic subtype cells increased significantly to 42.86% (=0.03) and the eosinophilic subtype cells were lowered to 31.43% (=0.01).The cold-sensitive asthmatic patients experience frequent recurrent and/or aggravated symptoms and have obvious lung function impairment.

Here, we showed that these mice were also resistant to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/12--tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA)-induced skin tumor formation. This resistance correlated with decreased expression of the senescence regulator, DNMT1, and increased expression of the senescence marker, p16Ink4a, in N-WASP-deficient epidermis. Moreover, primary N-WASP-null keratinocytes displayed a premature senescence phenotype . Expression and activation of p53, a major inducer of senescence, was not significantly altered in N-WASP-null keratinocytes. However, impairment of p53 function effectively rescued the senescence phenotype, indicating that N-WASP was an inhibitor of p53-induced senescence. Mechanistically, N-WASP regulated senescence by preventing p53-dependent degradation of the H3K9 methyltransferases, G9a/GLP, and the DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1, which both control keratinocyte senescence. This pathway collaborated with other N-WASP-independent, senescence-promoting signaling downstream of p53 and allowed the fine tuning of p53-induced senescence by N-WASP. Collectively, these data reveal N-WASP as an inhibitor of p53-induced senescence, which might be of importance for skin tumor formation and cellular aging of keratinocytes.

Eighteen compounds were isolated from Ginkgo male flowers including a novel matsutake alcohol glycoside, Ginkgoside A (1), and 17 known compounds-calaliukiuenoside (2), benzylalcohol O-α-l-arabinopyranosyl-(1 → 6)-β-d-glucopyranoside (3), amentoflavone (4), sciadopitysin (5), bilobetin (6), isoginkgetin (7), olivil 4-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (8), dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol-4-O-β-d-glucoside (9), (+)-cyclo-olivil-6-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (10), (-)-isolariciresinol 4-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (11), coniferin (12), trans-cinnamic acid-4-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (13), p-coumaryl alchol glucoside (14), stroside B (15), methylconiferin (16), cis-p-coumaric acid 4-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (17), and cis-coniferin (18). Thirteen of these compounds had not previously found in Ginkgo. All extractive fractions and isolated compounds were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory ability in the lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 macrophages. The ethanol extract of Ginkgo flowers and the chloroform and ethyl  fractions can significantly decrease nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E (PGE ) production at 100 μg/ml. The most effective compounds, bilobetin (6) and isoginkgetin (7), elevated the NO inhibition ratios to 80.19% and 82.37% at 50 μM, respectively. They also exhibited significant dose-dependent inhibitory effects on tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, PGE , inducible NO synthase mRNA, and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA levels.

A potential shortcut is assessing the antimicrobial activity of already approved drugs. Intrudingly, the antibacterial action of glatiramer  (GA) has recently been discovered. GA is a well-known and safe immunomodulatory drug particular effective against Gram-negative bacteria, which disrupts biological membranes by resembling the activity of antimicrobial peptides. Thus, GA can potentially be included in treatment strategies used to combat infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negatives. One potential application is chronic respiratory infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however the safety of GA inhalation has never been assessed. Here, the safety of inhaling nebulized GA is evaluated in a preclinical pig model. The potential side effects, i.e., bronchoconstriction, respiratory tract symptoms and systemic- and local  were assessed by ventilator monitoring, clinical observation, biochemistry, flowcytometry, and histopathology. No signs of bronchoconstriction assessed by increased airway peak pressure, Ppeak, or decreased oxygen pressure were observed. Also, there were no signs of local  in the final histopathology examination of the pulmonary tissue. As we did not observe any potential pulmonary side effects of inhaled GA, our preliminary results suggest that GA inhalation is safe and potentially can be a part of the treatment strategy targeting chronic lung infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30936698>Intraperitoneal delivery of -encapsulated liposomal nanoparticles for neuroprotection of the penumbra in a rat model of ischemic stroke.</a></h2><p>Ischemic stroke is a devastating condition, with metabolic derangement and persistent  enhancing the initial insult of ischaemia.

As  has a short blood half-life and high amounts irritate the gastrointestinal tract,  was administered encapsulated in a liposomal nanoparticle (liposomal-encapsulated , LITA).Transient ischemia was induced by 90 mins middle-cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in Sprague-Dawley rats, and LITA or control liposomes given intraperitoneally at occlusion and daily for up to two weeks post-MCAO. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to estimate lesion volume at 24 h, 1 and 2 weeks post-MCAO and anterior lateral ventricular volume (ALVv) at 2 weeks post-MCAO. Locomotive behaviour was tested prior to the final MRI scan. After the final scan, brains were collected, and immunohistochemistry was performed.Lesion volumes were decreased by ~80% from 24 h to one-week post-MCAO, in both control and LITA groups (⩽0.05). However, the lesion was increased by ~50% over the subsequent 1 to 2 weeks after MCAO in the control group (from 24.1±10.0 to 58.7±28.6 mm; ⩽0.05) but remained unchanged in the LITA group. ALVv were also attenuated by LITA treatment at 2 weeks post-MCAO (177.2±11.9% and 135.3±10.9% of contralateral ALVv for control and LITA groups, respectively; ⩽0.05). LITA-treated animals also appeared to have improved motor activity, moving with greater average velocity than control animals. Microglial immunoreactivity was ~40% lower in the LITA group compared to the control group (⩽0.05), but LITA did not modulate neurogenesis, apoptosis, histone acetylation and lipid peroxidation.LITA appears to attenuate the harmful chronic neuroinflammation observed during brain remodeling after a focal ischemic insult.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398661>Inhibitory effect of α-amyrin  isolated from Fraxinus rhynchophylla on Th17 polarization.</a></h2><p>T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which are differentiated from CD4 T cells, drive , leading to autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease.

However, the anticancer effect of the Nepenthes plant is rarely reported, especially for breast cancer cells. Here, we evaluate the antitumor effects of the ethyl  extract of   x ( x ) (EANT) against breast cancer cells. Cell viability and flow cytometric analyses were used to analyze apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. EANT exhibits a higher antiproliferation ability to two breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and SKBR3) as compared to normal breast cells (M10). A mechanistic study demonstrates that EANT induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells with evidence of subG1 accumulation and annexin V increment. EANT also induces glutathione (GSH) depletion, resulting in dramatic accumulations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX), as well as the depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). These oxidative stresses attack DNA, respectively leading to DNA double strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage in γH2AX and 8-oxo-2'deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) assays. Overall these findings clearly revealed that EANT induced changes were suppressed by the ROS inhibitor. In conclusion, our results have shown that the ROS-modulating natural product (EANT) has antiproliferation activity against breast cancer cells through apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563649>Nitidine chloride induces S phase cell cycle arrest and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in HaCaT cells and ameliorates skin lesions in psoriasis-like mouse models.</a></h2><p>Psoriasis is a common dermatosis causing considerable inconvenience to 4% of the general population. Traditional psoriasis treatments often cause side effects, drug resistance and complications, necessitating development of safer and more effective treatments. In this study, we screened over 600 natural compounds to identify viability inhibitors of human HaCaT keratinocytes cultured in vitro. The results showed that nitidine chloride was a highly effective inhibitor. Further studies revealed that nitidine chloride inhibited HaCaT proliferation and induced S phase cell cycle arrest; these effects were associated with reduced DNA synthesis, decreased Ki67, cyclin A, and cyclin D1 levels, and increased p53 protein expression. Nitidine chloride also significantly downregulated bcl-2 and upregulated bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3. Mechanistic studies revealed that nitidine chloride-induced apoptosis involved the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. More importantly, in 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13- (TPA)- and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced epidermal hyperplasia and  models, nitidine chloride inhibited topical edema in mouse ear and back skin, substantially reducing tissue thickness and weight. In some cases, nitidine chloride also ameliorated conditions caused by TPA and IMQ, such as angiogenesis and infiltration of large numbers of inflammatory cells around blood vessels. Additionally, nitidine chloride inhibited the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines in the two animal models. In conclusion, our results are the first to demonstrate that nitidine chloride inhibits the proliferation of HaCaT cells, induces apoptosis partly via the JNK signaling pathway in vitro and ameliorates skin lesions and  in vivo, making it an appropriate candidate for psoriasis treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the underlying mechanism of its anti-inflammatory effect is poorly understood.In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of EtOAc fractions of H. attenuatum Choisy (Ha-EtOAc) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophage  and hypothesized that Ha-EtOAc could attenuate  in the colon.LPS was utilized to induce RAW264.7 cells . The anti-inflammatory effect of Ha-EtOAc in RAW264.7 cells was evaluated by measuring the inhibition ratio of nitric oxide (NO) production. Murine ulcerative colitis (UC) was induced by treatment with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The basic indexes of the mice, including body weight, food intake and hematochezia, were recorded during mice experiments.The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Additionally, the influences of Ha-EtOAc on the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. In addition, the impact of Ha-EtOAc on gut microbiota of mice with UC was detected by 16S rDNA sequencing.Ha-EtOAc inhibited the LPS-induced production of NO and decreased the release of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment with Ha-EtOAc could suppress the nuclear translocation of p65 and the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38 and JNK. Ha-EtOAc treatment ameliorated murine UC, as reflected by a reduced body weight loss, improved colon shortening, alleviated mucosal damage and decreased releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, Ha-EtOAc could modulate the composition of microbial communities.Our results demonstrated that Ha-EtOAc exhibited anti-inflammatory effects mainly by suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, and Ha-EtOAc treatment may be a potent therapy for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Baseline NLR, overall survival, radiographic progression-free survival, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival were evaluated.Descriptive statistics, as well as Kaplan-Meier and Cox survival models were used to assess the effect of baseline NLR and changes in NLR on response to AA plus prednisone versus prednisone, with adjustment for important covariates.Among the 1082 patients who received treatment, baseline NLR values showed no significant differences according to baseline covariates except for albumin. Baseline variables were similar between dichotomous groups with an NLR cutoff of 2.5, except for a lower proportion of patients with >10 bone metastases in the NLR <2.5 group. Our survival results demonstrate that higher NLR values corresponded to poorer overall survival and PSA response to AA but not to placebo, which was confirmed in our adjusted regression models. No significant differences were seen in time to radiographic progression. In separate analyses, an increase or decrease in NLR by 2 from treatment baseline did not clearly signal subsequent lack of benefit with continued AA.Our results suggest that baseline NLR may be able to predict response to AA in men with asymptomatic mCRPC but that changes in NLR during treatment are insufficient to guide treatment. Further validation studies are warranted.In this report, we look at the ratio of circulating immune cells as a predictor of response to abiraterone  (AA), using data from a large trial. Our results suggest that this ratio derived from routinely obtained bloodwork can predict which patients respond better to AA.Copyright © 2019 European Association of Urology.

They have also been associated with dysbiosis of the digestive tract microbiota linked to metabolic disorders (anorexia, malnutrition and obesity) and with lesions of the digestive tract (colon cancer). Their detection in anaerobic pus specimens and oral and digestive tract specimens relies on microscopic examination by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, specific DNA extraction followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification of the 16S rRNA and mcrA gene fragments and isolation and culture in the supporting presence of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Diagnostic identification can be performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and can be further completed by genotyping through multi-spacer sequencing and, ultimately, whole genome sequencing (WGS).

Their impact on inflammatory responses in human keratinocytes and modes of action have not been addressed yet.Primary human keratinocytes are pretreated with HTy-Ac or HTy for 30 min and stimulated with IL-1β or Toll-like receptor 3 ligand (TLR3-l). Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), measured by ELISA, is attenuated by both polyphenols in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of several -related genes, including distinct TSLP isoforms and IL-8, are assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and likewise inhibited by HTy-Ac/HTy. Mechanistically, EVOO phenols counteracts IκB degradation and translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, a transcription factor of essential significance to TSLP and IL-8 transcriptional activity; this is evidenced by immunoblotting. Accordingly, NF-κB recruitment to critical binding sites in the TSLP and IL-8 promoter is impeded in the presence of HTy-Ac/HTy, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Promoter reporter assays finally reveal that the neutralizing effect on NF-κB induction has functional consequences, resulting in reduced NF-κB-directed transcription.EVOO phenols afford protection from  in human keratinocytes by interference with the NF-κB pathway.© 2019 The Authors.

Root Extracts Confer Neuroprotection by Attenuating Beta Amyloid-Induced Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines Released from Microglial Cells.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that eventually leads to severe cognitive impairment. Although the exact etiologies of AD still remain elusive, increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation cascades mediated by microglial cells are associated with AD. Piper sarmentosum Roxb. (PS) is a medicinal plant reported to possess various biological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-psychotic and anti-oxidant activity. However, little is known about the anti-inflammatory activity of PS roots despite their traditional use to treat inflammatory- mediated ailments.This study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of extracts obtained from the roots of PS against beta-amyloid (Aβ)-induced microglial toxicity associated with the production of pro-inflammatory mediators.BV2 microglial cells were treated with hexane (RHXN), dichloromethane (RDCM), ethyl  (REA) and methanol (RMEOH) extracts of the roots of PS prior to activation by Aβ. The production and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory mediators were evaluated by Griess reagent, ELISA kits and RT-qPCR respectively. The phosphorylation status of p38α MAPK was determined via western blot assay. BV2 conditioned medium was used to treat SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and the neuroprotective effect was assessed using MTT assay.PS root extracts, in particular RMEOH significantly attenuated the production and mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in Aβ-induced BV2 microglial cells. In addition, RHXN, REA and RMEOH extracts significantly reduced nitric oxide (NO) level and the inhibition of NO production was correlated with the total phenolic content of the extracts. Further mechanistic studies suggested that PS root extracts attenuated the production of cytokines by regulating the phosphorylation of p38α MAPK in microglia. Importantly, PS root extracts have protective effects against Aβ-induced indirect neurotoxicity either by inhibiting the production of NO, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in BV2 cells or by protecting SHSY5Y cells against these inflammatory mediators.These findings provided evidence that PS root extracts confer neuroprotection against Aβ- induced microglial toxicity associated with the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and may be a potential therapeutic agent for -related neurological conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD).Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444382>A high-sugar diet rapidly enhances susceptibility to colitis via depletion of luminal short-chain fatty acids in mice.</a></h2><p>Western-style diets have been implicated in triggering inflammatory bowel disease activity. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of a short-term diet high in sugar on susceptibility to colitis. Adult wild-type mice were placed on chow or a high sugar diet (50% sucrose) ± . After two days of diet, mice were treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. Disease severity was assessed daily. Colonic tissues were analyzed for cytokine expression using the MesoScale discovery platform. Intestinal dextran permeability and serum lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) were measured. Gut microbiota were analyzed by 16s rRNA sequencing and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations by gas chromatography. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were incubated with LPS and cytokine secretion measured. Mice on a high sugar diet had increased gut permeability, decreased microbial diversity and reduced SCFA. BMDM derived from high sugar fed mice were highly responsive to LPS. High sugar fed mice had increased susceptibility to colitis and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations. Oral  significantly attenuated colitis in mice by restoring permeability. In conclusion, short term exposure to a high sugar diet increases susceptibility to colitis by reducing short-chain fatty acids and increasing gut permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953822>Evaluation of anti-inflammatory potential of the leaves of Wendlandia heynei (Schult.) Santapau & Merchant in Sprague Dawley rat.</a></h2><p>The leaves of W. heynei (family: Rubiaceae) are used by the folklore in swelling, wounds and body aches. In this study anti-inflammatory potential of W. heynei leaves has been evaluated during in vitro studies and in rat.Methanol extract of the leaves of W. heynei (WHLM) and its fractions; n-hexane (WHLH), chloroform (WHLC), ethyl  (WHLE), n-butanol (WHLB) and residual soluble aqueous (WHLA) were screened for phytochemical analysis and several active constituents (alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, terpenoids, β-carotene and lycopene) were also quantified. Heat induced albumin denaturation assay and in vitro cell cultures was carried out for in vitro anti-inflammatory activity, while various in vivo assays like TPA induced ear edema, croton oil induced anus edema, formalin and carrageenan-induced hind paw edema was investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats. Alterations on levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and prostaglandins (PGE) induced with WHLE was studied in serum after carrageenan induced paw edema in rat. Meanwhile, the dose dependent WHLE inhibition of NFκB pathway via regulation of the phosphorylation of IKKs, IκBα, and p65 subunit was studied in LPS-induced rat peritoneal macrophages. On account of marked anti-inflammatory activity of WHLE its bioactive components were analyzed by HPLC-DAD analysis.The phytochemical analysis yielded alkaloids, saponins, tannins, coumarins, glycosides, quinones and vitamin C in WHLM and in all fractions. Fraction (WHLE) was enriched with alkaloids (20.20 ± 2.5%), flavonoids (25.26 ± 2.11%) and tannins (307.2 ± 2.03 mg of GAE/g of extract), while terpenoids (21.60 ± 1.65%) were the major constituents of WHLH. Ethyl  fraction convincingly protected heat induced albumin denaturation. WHLE exhibited highest edema inhibition in models of TPA-induced ear edema (74.51 ± 2.05) and croton oil-induced anal edema (75.38 ± 2.83). The pretreatment with WHLE significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the paw edema with formalin (78.99 ± 2.26%) assessed after 6 h and in carrageenan (75.71 ± 4.46%) was detected after 4 h. Level of anti-inflammatory markers; IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and PGE in carrageenan induced paw edema in serum of rat was significantly (p < 0.001) decreased with WHLE pretreatment to rat. WHLE significantly inhibited the NFκB by reducing the phosphorylation of IKKs, IκBα, and p65 subunit in LPS-induced  in rat peritoneal macrophages. HPLC-DAD analysis of WHLE indicated the presence of rutin, gallic acid, catechin, caffeic acid and myricetin.It is concluded that WHLM fractions have marked anti-inflammatory activity and this study endorsed the folklore use of W. heynei leaves for swelling related disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we synthesized DA and determined its anti-inflammatory potential on TPA-induced mice ear . First, we evaluated the non-toxic behaviour of DA on HaCaT cells. Additionally, we observed the free radical scavenging potential of DA at 60 μM to be 50%. This finding was further supported by nitric oxide assay, malondialdehyde assay, H2DCFDA staining and western blotting analysis of antioxidant enzymes. DA also suppressed the activation and polarization of macrophage phagocytic activity on RAW 264.7 cells. We further evaluated the expression of ICAM-1, MCP-1, MIP-2 and MIP-1β on in-vivo model system. Consequently, DA significantly reduced the production of NF-κB and COX-2 induced proinflammatory cytokine levels on TPA induced ear edema. Inhibition of MAPK and transcriptional factor NF-κB was also validated by western blotting analysis of p-ERK, p-p38, IKKα, IKKγ, IκBα, NF-κB-p65. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of NFκB-p65, TNF-α and IL-1β were also performed to support the findings. Conclusively, these results suggest that topical administration of DA significantly inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by blocking the canonical NF-κB and MAPK pathway. Therefore, we suggest DA as a potent therapeutic compound against skin  related diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We transplanted the fecal microbiota from an IBS-D patient and from a healthy volunteer to GF rats. The hepatic , serum biochemical parameters and metabolome, fecal microbiota profile, fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and correlations among them before and after berberine intervention were assessed. Compared with the healthy control fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) rats, the fecal microbiota of IBS-D patients induces significant Kupffer cell hyperplasia, hepatic sinusoid hypertrophy, and elevated levels of hepatic tumor necrosis factor- and interferon- and decreases the synthesis of ALB in GF rats. This is possibly related to  and  attributable to fecal formate, , and propionate levels, which are associated with the host linoleic acid pathway. Berberine can partially reverse the Kupffer cell hyperplasia, , fecal formate, , and propionate by modulating the gut microbiome composition.

We investigated the molecular mechanisms associated with the renoprotective effects of CG200745 using deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA)-salt hypertensive (DSH) rats. DOCA strips (200 mg/kg) were implanted into rats one week after unilateral nephrectomy. Two weeks after DOCA implantation, DSH rats were randomly divided into two groups that received either physiological saline or CG200745 (5 mg/kg/day) for another two weeks. The extent of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis was determined by Masson's trichrome staining. The renal expression of fibrosis and inflammatory markers was detected by semiquantitative immunoblotting, a polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. Pathological signs such as glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, increased systolic blood pressure, decreased creatinine clearance, and increased albumin-to-creatinine ratios in DSH rats were alleviated by CG200745 treatment compared to those manifestations in positive control animals. Furthermore, this treatment counteracted the increased expression of αSMA, TGF-β1, and Bax, and the decreased expression of Bcl-2 in the kidneys of DSH rats. It also attenuated the increase in the number of apoptotic cells in DSH rats. Thus, CG200745 can effectively prevent the progression of renal injury in DSH rats by exerting anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-apoptotic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31394727>Spotlight on a New Heme Oxygenase Pathway: Testosterone-Induced Shifts in Cardiac Oxidant/Antioxidant Status.</a></h2><p>A low testosterone level contributes to the development of oxidative damages; however, the cardiovascular effects of exogenous hormone therapy are not well elucidated. The aim of our work is to study the association of the testosterone level, antioxidant/oxidant system, and anti-inflammatory status related to the heme oxygenase (HO) system. To determine the effects of testosterone, 10-week-old, and 24-month-old sham-operated and castrated male Wistar rats were used. One part of the castrated animals was daily treated with 2.5 mg/kg cyproterone , while the hormone replacement therapy was performed via an  injection of a dose of 8.0 mg testosterone undecanoate/kg/once a week. The plasma testosterone level, the activity of HO and myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzymes; the concentrations of the HO-1, tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), as well as the total level of glutathione (GSH + GSSG) were determined from the cardiac left ventricle. In accordance with the testosterone values, the aging process and castration resulted in a decrease in antioxidant HO activity, HO-1 and cGMP concentrations and in the level of GSH + GSSG, whereas the inflammatory TNF-α and MPO activity significantly increased. Testosterone therapy was able to restore the physiological values. Our results clearly show that testosterone replacement therapy increases the antioxidant status and mitigates the inflammatory parameters via the modulation of the HO system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539577>Kan-Lu-Hsiao-Tu-Tan, a traditional Chinese medicine formula, inhibits human neutrophil activation and ameliorates imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin .</a></h2><p>Kan-Lu-Hsiao-Tu-Tan (KLHTT) is a popular traditional Chinese medicine for treating various inflammatory diseases.The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of KLHTT on human neutrophils and its therapeutic potential in treating imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like skin .Spectrophotometry, flow cytometry, and microscopy with immunohistochemical staining were used to evaluate superoxide anion generation, elastase release, CD11b expression, adhesion, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in activated human neutrophils. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species in cell-free systems were measured using a multi-well fluorometer or a spectrophotometer. A psoriasis-like skin  was induced in mice using the IMQ cream.KLHTT suppressed superoxide anion generation, ROS production, CD11b expression, and adhesion in activated human neutrophils. In contrast, KLHTT failed to alter elastase release in activated human neutrophils. Additionally, KLHTT had an ROS-scavenging effect in the AAPH assay, but it did not scavenge superoxide anions directly in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay. Protein kinase C (PKC)-induced NET formation most commonly occurs through ROS-dependent mechanisms. KLHTT significantly inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-, a PKC activator, inducing NET formation. Furthermore, topical KLHTT treatment reduced the area affected by psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score and ameliorated neutrophil infiltration in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin  in mice.Our data show that KLHTT has anti-neutrophilic inflammatory effects in inhibiting ROS generation and cell adhesion. KLHTT also mitigated NET formation, mainly via an ROS-dependent pathway. In addition, KLHTT reduced neutrophil infiltration and improved the severity of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin  in mice. Therefore, KLHTT may prove to be a safe and effective psoriasis therapy in the future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

If irAEs are severe or require systemic steroids, cancer therapy is often held or discontinued. Local steroid therapy for cancer therapy-associated uveitis allows the continuation of cancer therapy. This series demonstrates successful management of cancer therapy-associated uveitis with local therapy based on uveitis subtype.This is an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective case series of patients with uveitis secondary to immunotherapy or targeted therapy managed with local treatment, and focused literature review.Five patients (median age: 54, range 31 to 75) were included. Time to uveitis onset following cancer therapy initiation was 3 to 12 months. All patients received  inhibitor therapy; one patient additionally received targeted therapy. Two patients presented with anterior uveitis, two with panuveitis and one with posterior uveitis. Four of five patients demonstrated evidence of posterior segment inflammation on multimodal imaging. Anterior uveitis was successfully treated with topical prednisolone  1% (PA 1%) alone, and posterior segment involvement recalcitrant to topical PA 1% was treated successfully with topical difluprednate, intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide or a combination. Patients with isolated anterior uveitis did not require maintenance topical therapy; those with posterior and panuveitis required chronic low-dose topical therapy.Based on our series as well as the existing literature demonstrating the use of local therapy for irAEs, we propose an approach to local therapy for cancer therapy-associated uveitis starting with topical steroids and initiating injectable steroids in cases of recalcitrant panuveitis or posterior uveitis. Subclinical inflammation on posterior segment imaging responds robustly to difluprednate or intravitreal steroid therapy, and patients with posterior segment involvement may require more aggressive management and long-term maintenance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Although accumulated evidence has revealed the presence of neutrophils in vascular lesions, the effect of oxLDL on neutrophil function has not been properly investigated. In the present decade, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) gained immense attention not only as a primary response against pathogenic bacteria but also due to their pathological roles in tissue damage in various diseases, such as atherosclerosis and thrombosis. In this study, we investigated if oxLDL affects NET formation and if it is a risk factor for inflammatory reactions in endothelial cells. HL-60-derived neutrophils were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) for 30 min to induce NET formation, followed by incubation with 20 μg/mL native or oxidized LDL for additional 2 h. Culture media of the stimulated cells containing released NETs components were collected to evaluate NET formation by fluorometric quantitation of released DNA and detection of myeloperoxidase (MPO) by western blot analysis. NET formation of HL-60-derived neutrophils induced by PMA was significantly enhanced by additional incubation with oxLDL but not with native LDL. Treatment of HL-60-derived neutrophils with oxLDL alone in the absence of PMA did not induce NET formation. Furthermore, the culture media of HL-60-derived neutrophils after NET formation were then transferred to human aortic endothelial cell (HAECs) culture. Treatment of HAECs with the culture media containing NETs formed by HL-60-derived neutrophils increased the expression of metalloproteinase-1 protein in HAECs when HL-60-derived neutrophils were incubated with native LDL, and the expression was accelerated in the case of oxLDL. In addition, the culture media from NETs formed by HL-60-derived neutrophils caused the elongation of HAECs, which was immensely enhanced by coincubation with native LDL or oxLDL.

Herein, using betamethasone  (BA), a glucocorticoid, and a solid lipid nanoparticle formulation of siRNA, we confirmed that coencapsulating BA into the siRNA solid lipid nanoparticles significantly reduced the proinflammatory activity of the siRNA nanoparticles in a mouse model. Using TNF-α siRNA, we then showed that the BA and TNF-α siRNA coencapsulated into the solid lipid nanoparticles acted as a dual anti-inflammatory and synergistically reduced TNF-α release by mouse macrophages in culture following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, as compared to solid lipid nanoparticles encapsulated with TNF-α siRNA or BA alone. Importantly, upon studying the effect of the ratio of BA and TNF-α siRNA on the proinflammatory activity of the resultant nanoparticles, we identified that BA and TNF-α siRNA coencapsulated solid lipid nanoparticles prepared with a BA to TNF-α siRNA weight ratio of 2:1 induced the lowest proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages in culture. This result was in comparison to nanoparticles prepared with BA to TNF-α siRNA ratios both higher and lower than 2:1 (i.e., 4:1, 1:1, and 0.5:1) and is likely due to differences in molecular interactions among the various components in the BA and TNF-α-siRNA coencapsulated solid lipid nanoparticles at these ratios. Encapsulating glucocorticoids into siRNA-nanoparticles represents a viable strategy to reduce the proinflammatory activity of the nanoparticles; however, the ratio of the glucocorticoid to siRNA in the nanoparticles requires optimization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31280182>Periovulatory administration of firocoxib did not alter ovulation rates and mitigated post-breeding inflammatory response in mares.</a></h2><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a therapeutic option for the treatment of . However, negative effects of non-selective NSAIDs for treatment of mares with endometritis have been described, including delayed uterine clearance and impairment of ovulations. Firocoxib is a specific cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor and has the ability to act in the uterus of mares. We investigated the effects of firocoxib on ovulation rate, numbers of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), and COX-2 protein levels in the endometrial tissue of susceptible mares after insemination. Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, twenty mares were evaluated in two consecutive estrous cycles broken into the following groups: Control - no pharmacological interference; Treatment - mares were treated with 0.2 mg/kg of firocoxib orally. The treatment began on the day of ovulation induction, and firocoxib was administered until one day after artificial insemination (AI). Ovulation was induced with 1 mg of deslorelin  and the mares were inseminated 24 h after the injection. Ovulation was confirmed 48 h after induction, and embryos were collected eight days after ovulation. Experiment 2: Nine mares susceptible to persistent mating-induced endometritis (PMIE) were artificially inseminated. The mares were examined with ultrasound and inseminated with fresh semen in two consecutive cycles, control and treated, in a cross-over study design. The amount of intrauterine fluid was measured, and endometrial samples were collected 24 h after AI. The number of PMNs was determined by endometrial cytology and biopsy, and COX-2 labeling in endometrial samples was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Firocoxib treatment did not induce ovulatory failure or affect embryo recovery rate in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, firocoxib treatment reduced  after AI in mares as evidenced with results regarding PMN numbers/percentage and endometrial COX-2 staining. In conclusion, the proposed treatment with firocoxib reduced endometrial  in mares susceptible to PMIE after breeding, with no adverse effects.Copyright © 2019.

All patients were treated with the same 2-week course of prednisolone  1% drops four times per day. The clinical parameters evaluated were surface dimensions determined by slitlamp biomicroscopy, cross-sectional dimensions determined by AS-OCT, and symptom scores determined by patient surveys. Pretreatment and 1-month posttreatment values were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Patients were followed up to 1 year after treatment.Twenty-two eyes from 22 patients (4 men and 18 women) with an average age of 37.7±8.8 (range, 27-57) years and an average duration of symptoms of 22 (range, 5-60) days were included.

Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Kuntze has been shown to lower blood glucose and attenuate high glucose-induced vascular endothelial cells injury. In the present study we investigated the effects of ethyl  extract of C. chinense (CCE) on PA-induced  and IR in the vascular endothelium and its molecular mechanism. We found that CCE significantly inhibited PA-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Consequently, this led to the inhibition of the following downstream adapted proteins myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-  and TNF receptor-associated factor 6. Moreover, CCE inhibited the phosphorylation of Ikappa B kinase  , nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-  B), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular regulated protein kinases, p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and subsequently suppressed the release of tumor necrosis factor-  , interleukin-1  (IL-1  ) and IL-6. CCE also inhibited IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and ameliorated insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Moreover, CCE restored serine/threonine kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and thus increased insulin-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production in PA-treated HUVECs. This led to reverse insulin mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation, eNOS phosphorylation and NO production in PA-treated rat thoracic aortas. These results suggest that CCE can significantly inhibit the inflammatory response and alleviate impaired insulin signaling in the vascular endothelium by suppressing TLR4-mediated NF-  B and MAPK pathways. Therefore, CCE can be considered as a potential therapeutic candidate for endothelial dysfunction associated with IR and diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31067776>Effects of Intestinal Microbial⁻Elaborated Butyrate on Oncogenic Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microbiota is well known to have multiple benefits on human health, including cancer prevention and treatment. The effects are partially mediated by microbiota-produced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, propionate and . The anti-cancer effect of butyrate has been demonstrated in cancer cell cultures and animal models of cancer. Butyrate, as a signaling molecule, has effects on multiple signaling pathways. The most studied effect is its inhibition on histone deacetylase (HDAC), which leads to alterations of several important oncogenic signaling pathways such as JAK2/STAT3, VEGF. Butyrate can interfere with both mitochondrial apoptotic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. In addition, butyrate also reduces gut  by promoting T-regulatory cell differentiation with decreased activities of the NF-κB and STAT3 pathways. Through PKC and Wnt pathways, butyrate increases cancer cell differentiation. Furthermore, butyrate regulates oncogenic signaling molecules through microRNAs and methylation. Therefore, butyrate has the potential to be incorporated into cancer prevention and treatment regimens. In this review we summarize recent progress in butyrate research and discuss the future development of butyrate as an anti-cancer agent with emphasis on its effects on oncogenic signaling pathways. The low bioavailability of butyrate is a problem, which precludes clinical application. The disadvantage of butyrate for medicinal applications may be overcome by several approaches including nano-delivery, analogue development and combination use with other anti-cancer agents or phytochemicals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316490>The Capacity of the Fecal Microbiota From Malawian Infants to Ferment Resistant Starch.</a></h2><p>In Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC), weaning is associated with environmentally acquired and -associated enteric disorders. Dietary intake of high amylose maize starch (HAMS) can promote commensal fermentative bacteria and drive the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). By stabilizing commensal gut microbiology, and stimulating the production of anti-inflammatory metabolites, HAMS supplementation might therefore influence enteric health. However, the extent to which the gut microbiota of LMIC infants are capable of fermenting HAMS is unclear. We assessed the capacity of the fecal microbiota from pre-weaning and weaning Malawian infants to ferment HAMS and produce SCFAs using an  fermentation model. Fecal microbiota from both pre-weaning and weaning infants were able to ferment HAMS, as indicated by an increase in bacterial load and total SCFA concentration, and a reduction in pH. All of these changes were more substantial in the weaning group.  production was observed with both pre-weaning and weaning groups, while propionate production was only observed in the weaning group. HAMS fermentation resulted in significant alterations to the fecal microbial community in the weaning group, with significant increases in levels of , and  associated with propionate production. In conclusion, fecal microbiota from Malawian infants before and during weaning has the capacity to produce  through HAMS fermentation, with propionate biosynthetic capability appearing only at weaning. Our results suggest that HAMS supplementation might provide benefit to infants during weaning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738116>Total flavonoid aglycones extract in Radix Scutellariae induces cross-regulation between autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Radix Scutellariae (RS), the dried root of Scutellariae baicalensis Georgi, known as a herbal medicine in several Asian countries including China, has been widely used to treat , hypertension, cardiovascular disease as well as cancer. The total flavonoid aglycone extracted (TFAE) was extracted by ethyl  and this extraction methodology was optimized and obtained the protection of Chinese patents.To investigate the underlying mechanism of the chemotherapeutic effects of TFAE in inducing autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.We performed CCK8 assays, AnnexinV-FITC/PI staining, flow cytometry assays, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence analysis and Western blot to study the molecular mechanism of TFAE in inducing autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.In vitro, TFAE exhibits significant anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer cell lines, especially for BxPC3 (IC = 6.5 μg mL). Moreover, TFAE induces apoptosis and autophagy as evidenced by the increased apoptosis or autophagy-related protein level, the increased the fraction of apoptotic cells and the punctuate patterns of LC3 II. Furthermore, TFAE induce autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition. Interestingly, pharmacological block autophagy by 3-MA enhanced TFAE-induced apoptosis, indicating that TFAE induced autophagy functions as a cytoprotective process against apoptosis. In vivo, 150 mg/kg TFAE inhibited the BxPC3 tumor growth in immune deficient mice with the inhibitory rate of 66.87% and induced both apoptosis and autophagy.TFAE have anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer and can induce apoptosis and autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway. TFAE might be a potential anticancer drug to be further developed for human pancreatic cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we examined the effects of flaxseed powder, which includes all flaxseed components, flaxseed oil, composed mainly of ALA, flaxseed lignan, and flaxseed fiber, on hypertension and renal damage induced by deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA)-salt. Then, we investigated the mechanisms of action associated with the effects of flaxseed.Flaxseed powder, oil, lignan, or fiber was administered to DOCA-salt rats. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), urinary protein excretion, renal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, sympathetic nerve activity, and gene expression of inflammatory mediators in the kidney and hypothalamus were measured.Flaxseed powder and oil reduced the increases in SBP and urinary protein excretion induced by DOCA-salt treatment, whereas lignan and fiber had no effects. Flaxseed oil suppressed the increase in renal ACE activity, sympathetic nerve activity, and gene expression of renal and hypothalamic inflammatory mediators.Flaxseed has antihypertensive and renoprotective effects in DOCA-salt rats. These effects are likely principally exerted by ALA. Furthermore, the suppression of renal ACE activity, sympathetic nerve activity, and  is partly involved in the effects of flaxseed.© 2019 S.

Patients with acetaminophen-induced ALF have increased neutrophil TLR9 expression which can be induced by ammonia. We determined whether ammonia-induced brain edema and  dysfunction are mediated by TLR9 and if this could be prevented in a TLR9-deficient mouse model.Ammonium  (NH-Ac; 4mmol/kg) was injected intraperitoneally in wild type (WT), Tlr9 and Lysm-Cre Tlr9 mice (TLR9 absent in neutrophils and macrophages including Kupffer cells) and compared to controls. Six hours after NH-Ac injection, intracellular cytokine production was determined in splenic macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Brain water (BW) and total plasma DNA (tDNA) were also measured. The impact of the TLR9 antagonist ODN2088 (50μg/mouse) was evaluated.Following NH-Ac injection, BW, macrophage and T  cytokine production increased (p<0.0001) in WT but not Tlr9 mice (p<0.001). ODN2088 inhibited macrophage and T  cytokine production (p<0.05) and prevented an increase in BW (p<0.0001). Following NH-Ac injection, macrophage cytokine production and BW were ameliorated in Lysm-Cre Tlr9 mice compared to WT mice (p<0.05) but there was no difference compared to Tlr9 mice. Following NH-Ac injection, plasma tDNA levels increased in WT and Tlr9 mice (p<0.05) suggesting that TLR9 may be activated by DNA released from ammonia-stimulated cells.Ammonia-induced brain edema requires macrophage and T  expression of TLR9. Amelioration of brain edema and lymphocyte cytokine production by ODN2088 supports exploration of TLR9 antagonism in early ALF to prevent progression to ICH.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

GCs cause a plethora of changes in the trabecular meshwork (TM), an ocular tissue that regulates intraocular pressure (IOP). GCs act through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and the GR regulates transcription both through transactivation and transrepression. Many of the anti-inflammatory properties of GCs are mediated by GR transrepression, while GR transactivation largely accounts for GC metabolic effects and side effects of GC therapy. There is no evidence showing which of the two mechanisms plays a role in GC-OHT.GRdim transgenic mice (which have active transrepression and impaired transactivation) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice received weekly periocular dexamethasone  (DEX-Ac) injections. IOP, outflow facilities, and biochemical changes to the TM were determined.GRdim mice did not develop GC-OHT after continued DEX treatment, while WT mice had significantly increased IOP and decreased outflow facilities. Both TM tissue in eyes of DEX-treated GRdim mice and cultured TM cells isolated from GRdim mice had reduced or no change in the expression of fibronectin, myocilin, collagen type I, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). GRdim mouse TM (MTM) cells also had a significant reduction in DEX-induced cytoskeletal changes, which was clearly seen in WT MTM cells.We provide the first evidence for the role of GR transactivation in regulating GC-mediated gene expression in the TM and in the development of GC-OHT. This discovery suggests a novel therapeutic approach for treating ocular  without causing GC-OHT and glaucoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629736>Genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of immunosubunit β5i attenuates cardiac remodeling in deoxycorticosterone- (DOCA)-salt hypertensive mice.</a></h2><p>Hypertensive cardiac remodeling is a major cause of heart failure. The immunoproteasome is an inducible form of the proteasome and its catalytic subunit β5i (also named LMP7) is involved in angiotensin II-induced atrial fibrillation; however, its role in deoxycorticosterone- (DOCA)-salt-induced cardiac remodeling remains unclear. C57BL/6 J wild-type (WT) and β5i knockout (β5i KO) mice were subjected to uninephrectomy (sham) and DOCA-salt treatment for three weeks. Cardiac function, fibrosis, and  were evaluated by echocardiography and histological analysis. Protein and gene expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting. Our results showed that after 21 days of DOCA-salt treatment, β5i expression and chymotrypsin-like activity were the most significantly increased factors in the heart compared with the sham control. Moreover, DOCA-salt-induced elevation of blood pressure, adverse cardiac function, chamber and myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, oxidative stress, and  were markedly attenuated in β5i KO mice. These findings were verified in β5i inhibitor PR-957-treated mice. Moreover, blocking of PTEN (the gene of phosphate and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) markedly attenuated the inhibitory effect of β5i knockout on DOCA-salt-induced cardiac remodeling. Mechanistically, DOCA-salt stress upregulated the expression of β5i, which promoted the degradation of PTEN and the activation of downstream signals (AKT/mTOR, TGF-β1/Smad2/3, NOX, and NF-κB), which ultimately led to cardiac hypertrophic remodeling. This study provides new evidence of the critical role of β5i in DOCA-salt-induced cardiac remodeling through the regulation of PTEN stability, and indicates that the inhibition of β5i may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertensive heart diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Topical therapy with corticosteroids is recommended, but they can have side effects.We aimed to compare the effects of ozonides with vitamin E  (OZOILE) versus topical corticosteroid in children undergoing circumcision.Twenty children undergoing circumcision were treated before surgery: 10 children with OZOILE cream and 10 with 0.1% mometasone furoate once a day for 7 days. Ten age-matched patients with LS of the foreskin without any treatment were recruited as controls. Transcript levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and e-cadherin were evaluated in removed foreskins by qRT-PCR.OZOILE and steroid topical treatment produced a similar reduction of TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA levels in foreskins from patients with LS when compared to untreated patients (p < 0.001). OZOILE and steroid treatment caused an increase in the transcript levels of IL-13 and e-cadherin in the foreskin of patients affected by LS in comparison to untreated foreskin (p < 0.001).On the basis of our biochemical data, a randomized clinical trial might be useful to verify the actual clinical effect of OZOILE as alternative treatment to corticosteroids in children affected by LS of the foreskin.© 2019 S.

Growing evidence suggests that the microbiota plays a role in the occurrence and evolution of this disease, namely through the production of bioactive metabolites.Omics technologies (metagenomic, metabolomic, and phenomic data) allow providing a robust prediction of steatosis. More than just correlations, causative effects of certain bacterial metabolites have been evidenced in vitro and in rodent models. Butyrate has been shown to be a potent metabolic and inflammatory modulator in the liver. Several aromatic amino-acids such as phenylacetic acid, imidazole propionate, and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate have been identified as potential inducers of steatosis and hepatic , whereas indolic compounds (indole and indole-3-) seem to preserve liver integrity. Current clinical trials aim at evaluating the efficacy of novel approaches (functional foods, prebiotic and probiotics, and fecal microbial transplants).The microbiota brings new hopes in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Adequate intervention studies in targeted patients are needed to unravel the relevance of such approaches in the management of those liver diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796172>Small-Animal PET/CT Imaging of Local and Systemic Immune Response Using Cu-αCD11b.</a></h2><p>Current noninvasive imaging methods for monitoring immune response were largely developed for interrogation of the local reaction. This study developed the radiotracer Cu-labeled anti-CD11b (Cu-αCD11b) for longitudinal assessment of local and systemic immune response involving mobilization of CD11b myeloid cells by small-animal PET/CT.  Acute or chronic  in the ears of BALB/c mice was induced by 12--tetradecanoylphorbol-13-. Acute lung  was induced by intratracheal lipopolysaccharide inoculation. αCD11b was conjugated with -SCN-Bn-DOTA followed by labeling with Cu. PET/CT and biodistribution were evaluated at different times after intravenous injection of Cu-αCD11b. Cell populations from bone marrow (BM) and spleen were analyzed by flow cytometry.  Cu-αCD11b was primarily taken up by BM and spleen in control mice. In comparison, Cu-αCD11b uptake was significantly reduced in the BM and spleen of CD11b-knockout mice, indicating that Cu-αCD11b selectively homed to CD11b myeloid cells in vivo. In mice with ear , for the local inflammatory response, Cu-αCD11b PET/CT revealed significantly higher Cu-αCD11b uptake in the inflamed ears in the acute  phase than the chronic phase, consistent with markedly increased infiltration of CD11b cells into the inflammatory lesions at the acute phase. Moreover, imaging of Cu-αCD11b also showed the difference in mouse systemic response for different inflammatory stages. Compared with uptake in control mice, BM Cu-αCD11b uptake in mice with ear  was significantly lower in the acute phase and higher in the chronic phase, reflecting an initial mobilization of CD11b cells from the BM to the inflammatory foci followed by a compensatory regeneration of CD11b myeloid cells in the BM. Similarly, in mice with lung , Cu-αCD11b PET/CT readily detected acute lung  and recruitment of CD11b myeloid cells from the BM. Immunohistochemistry staining and flow cytometry results confirmed the noninvasive imaging of PET/CT.  Cu-αCD11b PET/CT successfully tracked ear and pulmonary  in mice and differentiated acute from chronic  at the local and systemic levels.

We previously reported that mice with germline deletion of the p38δ gene are significantly protected from chemical skin carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated the effects of cell-selective targeted ablation of p38δ in keratinocytes and in immune (myeloid) cells on skin tumor development in a two-stage 7,12-dimethylbenz()anthracene (DMBA)/12--tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) chemical mouse skin carcinogenesis model. Conditional keratinocyte-specific p38δ ablation (p38δ-cKO) did not influence the latency, incidence, or multiplicity of chemically-induced skin tumors, but led to increased tumor volume in females during the TPA promotion stage, and reduced malignant progression in males and females relative to their wild-type counterparts. In contrast, conditional myeloid cell-specific p38δ deletion (p38δ-cKO) inhibited DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumorigenesis in male but not female mice. Thus, tumor onset was delayed, and tumor incidence, multiplicity, and volume were reduced in p38δ-cKO males compared with control wild-type males. Moreover, the percentage of male mice with malignant tumors was decreased in the p38δ-cKO group relative to their wild-type counterparts. Collectively, these results reveal that cell-specific p38δ targeting modifies susceptibility to chemical skin carcinogenesis in a context-, stage-, and sex-specific manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485249>Genus : A Review of Phytochemistry and Pharmacology.</a></h2><p>Genus  (family Annonaceae), widely distributed in mainland Asia and Australia to New Guinea, has been employed in both traditional herbal uses and pharmacological medicines.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have protective effects on experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) responses but the detailed roles of SCFAs and their receptors in regulating autoimmune CNS  have been unclear. SCFAs metabolically regulate T cells and change the phenotype of antigen presenting cells to efficiently induce IL-10 regulatory T cells. In line with the overall protective effect, blood levels of major SCFAs, such as , propionate and butyrate, are significantly decreased in long-term active progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Importantly, SCFAs can induce CD4 effector T cells, which are highly inflammatory when transferred into mice, suggesting that the direct effect of SCFAs on T cells can even be pro-inflammatory in the CNS. In contrast to the moderate protective effect of SCFAs, mice deficient in GPR41 or GPR43 are more resistant to EAE pathogenesis. Thus, despite the overall protective function of SCFAs, SCFAs and their receptors have the potential to regulate autoimmune CNS  both positively and negatively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891007>Elevated Gut Microbiome-Derived Propionate Levels Are Associated With Reduced Sterile Lung  and Bacterial Immunity in Mice.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are important dietary and microbiome metabolites that can have roles in gut immunity as well as further afield. We previously observed that gut microbiome alteration via antibiotics led to attenuated lung inflammatory responses. The rationale for this study was to identify gut microbiome factors that regulate lung immune homeostasis. We first investigated key factors within mouse colonic lumen filtrates (CLF) which could elicit direct inflammatory effects . We identified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and SCFAs as key CLF ingredients whose levels and inflammatory capacity changed after antibiotic exposure in mice. Specifically, the SCFA propionate appeared to be a key regulator of LPS responses . Elevated propionate:  ratios, as seen in CLF after antibiotic exposure, strongly blunted inflammatory responses . , exposure of lungs to high dose propionate, to mimic how prior antibiotic exposure changed SCFA levels, resulted in diminished immune containment of  pneumonia. Finally, we discovered an enrichment of propionate-producing gut bacteria in mice with reduced lung  following lung ischemia reperfusion injury . Overall, our data show that propionate levels can distinctly modulate lung immune responses  and  and that gut microbiome increased production of propionate is associated with reduced lung .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082458>Butyrate ameliorates allergic airway  by limiting eosinophil trafficking and survival.</a></h2><p>Lung eosinophilia is a hallmark of asthma, and eosinophils are believed to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammatory diseases. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as , propionate, and butyrate, are produced in high amounts in the gastrointestinal tract by commensal bacteria and can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Although there is recent evidence that SCFAs are beneficial in allergic asthma models, the effect on eosinophils has remained elusive.The role of SCFAs was investigated in human eosinophil function and a mouse model of allergic asthma.Eosinophils were purified from self-reported allergic or healthy donors. Migration, adhesion to the endothelium, and eosinophil survival were studied in vitro. Ca flux, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and expression of surface markers were determined by using flow cytometry and in part by using real-time PCR. Allergic airway  was assessed in vivo in an ovalbumin-induced asthma model by using invasive spirometry.For the first time, we observed that SCFAs were able to attenuate human eosinophils at several functional levels, including (1) adhesion to the endothelium, (2) migration, and (3) survival. These effects were independent from GPR41 and GPR43 but were accompanied by histone acetylation and mimicked by trichostatin A, a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor. In vivo butyrate ameliorated allergen-induced airway and lung eosinophilia, reduced type 2 cytokine levels in bronchial fluid, and improved airway hyperresponsiveness in mice.These in vitro and in vivo findings highlight the importance of SCFAs, especially butyrate as a promising therapeutic agent in allergic inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is increasingly considered to be causatively related to IBD and is strongly affected by components of a Western life style. Bacteria that ferment fibers and produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are typically reduced in mucosa and feces of patients with IBD, as compared to healthy individuals. SCFAs, such as , propionate and butyrate, are important metabolites in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Several studies have indeed shown that fecal SCFAs levels are reduced in active IBD. SCFAs are an important fuel for intestinal epithelial cells and are known to strengthen the gut barrier function. Recent findings, however, show that SCFAs, and in particular butyrate, also have important immunomodulatory functions. Absorption of SCFAs is facilitated by substrate transporters like MCT1 and SMCT1 to promote cellular metabolism. Moreover, SCFAs may signal through cell surface G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A, to activate signaling cascades that control immune functions. Transgenic mouse models support the key role of these GPCRs in controlling intestinal . Here, we present an overview of microbial SCFAs production and their effects on the intestinal mucosa with specific emphasis on their relevance for IBD. Moreover, we discuss the therapeutic potential of SCFAs for IBD, either applied directly or by stimulating SCFAs-producing bacteria through pre- or probiotic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31065990>Radix Kansui Stir-Fried with Vinegar Reduces Radix Kansui-Related Hepatotoxicity in Mice via Mitochondrial Pathway.</a></h2><p>To investigate the mechanism of Radix Kansui (RK) stir-fried with vinegar (VRK) decreased hepatotoxicity in mice.According to a random number table, 40 mice were randomly divided into negative control group (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium, 20 mL/kg), positive control group (0.1% mixture of carbon tetrachloride in soybean oil, 20 mL/kg), RK group (the ethyl  extracts of RK, 250 g crude drug/kg) and VRK group (the ethyl  extracts of VRK, 250 g crude drug/kg) with 10 mice per group.

Hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nickend labeling (TUNEL) assay. Immunohistochemical technique was adopted to detect the expression of particular antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins in the mitochondrial pathways, including B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2) and caspase-3, as well as the expression of inflammatory mediators, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF- κ B) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).Liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis were observed in RK mice, and the liver injury were significantly reduced in VRK-treated mice.

This was subsequently fractionated using N-hexane, Dichloromethane (DCM) and Ethyl . The Dichloromethane fraction which is the most potent fraction (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) was evaluated for memory enhancing activity using the Y-maze (YMT), morris water maze (MWM) and the elevated plus maze (EPM) on D-galactose plus scopolamine and ketamine induced amnesia. The antioxidant markers and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibiting effect of DCM were also investigated.The results obtained from the behavioural study indicates that the DCM fraction significantly (p<0.05) increased alternation behaviour of mice in the YMT, decreased the escape latency in the MWM paradigm and decreased the transfer latency in the EPM. Biochemically, DCM increased glutathione, and superoxide dismutase, but decreased malondialdehyde and AChE activity in the brain.The findings therefore suggests that the DCM possesses significant memory enhancing activity, which may be due to enhancement of antioxidant activity and cholinergic transmission. The attenuation of the effect of ketamine by the DCM may possibly result from an increase in NMDA receptor mediated neurotransmission and attenuation of oxidative stress.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31359357>The effects of megestrol  on nutrition,  and quality of life in elderly haemodialysis patients.</a></h2><p>Malnutrition,  and poor quality of life are prevalent among elderly haemodialysis patients. Megestrol  (MA) is a synthetic progestin that is widely used to increase appetite and weight in various clinical settings. MA has been indicated to be effective in improving quality of life in patients with cancers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MA in treating malnourished elderly haemodialysis patients.A randomized controlled study involving 46 hypoalbuminemia haemodialysis patients aged 70 years or older was conducted. The patients in MA-treated group (n = 23) took 160 mg of MA daily, while those in control group (n = 23) were enrolled without any intervention. Anthropometric parameters and laboratory results, including height, dry weight, body mass index, and modified subjective global assessment score as well as serum albumin, triglyceride, total cholesterol, hsCRP, IL-1b and IL-6 concentrations were measured in all patients before and after the intervention. Health-related quality of life was also evaluated using the KDQOL-SF 1.3.In the MA-treated group, a total of 18 patients finished the therapy over a 3-month period. Appetite was reported as improved by 15 patients, and a statistically significant increase was observed in dry weight (53.36 ± 6.15 vs. 54.24 ± 6.32, P < 0.01) and serum albumin concentration (29.05 ± 3.91 vs. 37.67 ± 4.88, P < 0.01) in the MA-treated group compared to those of the control group.

There was no significant change in the inflammatory marker concentrations after the intervention. No serious or unexpected adverse events were observed except that one patient who withdrew due to excessive fluid gain between haemodialysis sessions.Our data suggest that MA can be effective in improving nutritional status and quality of life by increasing appetite in elderly haemodialysis patients with acceptable side effects; however, MA might not ameliorate .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623142>Multifunctional Coatings for Robotic Implanted Device.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was the preparation and physico-chemical, mechanical, biological, and functional characterization of a multifunctional coating for an innovative, fully implantable device. The multifunctional coating was designed to have three fundamental properties: adhesion to device, close mechanical resemblance to human soft tissues, and control of the inflammatory response and tissue repair process. This aim was fulfilled by preparing a multilayered coating based on three components: a hydrophilic primer to allow device adhesion, a poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel layer to provide good mechanical compliance with the human tissue, and a layer of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) fibers. The use of biopolymer fibers offered the potential for a long-term interface able to modulate the release of an anti-inflammatory drug (dexamethasone), thus contrasting acute and chronic  response following device implantation. Two copolymers, poly(vinyl -acrylic acid) and poly(vinyl alcohol-acrylic acid), were synthetized and characterized using thermal analysis (DSC, TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR chemical imaging), in vitro cell viability, and an adhesion test. The resulting hydrogels were biocompatible, biostable, mechanically compatible with soft tissues, and able to incorporate and release the drug. Finally, the multifunctional coating showed a good adhesion to titanium substrate, no in vitro cytotoxicity, and a prolonged and controlled drug release.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579948>Hypertension-induced cardiac impairment is reversed by the inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) has been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. However, the role and mechanisms of ERS on hypertension-induced cardiac functional and morphological changes remain unclear. In this study, the effect of ERS inhibition with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) on hypertension-induced cardiac remodelling was examined.Hypertension was induced by deoxycorticosterone- (DOCA) and salt administration in uni-nephrectomized rats for 12 weeks. TUDCA was administered for the last four weeks. Rhythmic activity and contractions of the right atrium and left papillary muscle (LPM) were recorded. In the left ventricle, the expression of various proteins was examined and histopathological evaluation was performed.Hypertension-induced increments in systolic blood pressure and ventricular contractions were reversed by TUDCA. In the hypertensive heart, while expressions of glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78), phospho-dsRNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (p-PERK), sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase-2 (SERCA2), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and nuclear NF-κB p65 increased; Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) expression decreased and the altered levels of all these markers were restored by TUDCA. In the microscopic examination, TUDCA treatment attenuated hypertension-stimulated cardiac  and fibrosis.These results suggest that ERS inhibition may ameliorate cardiac contractility through improving ERS-associated calcium mishandling, apoptosis,  and fibrosis, thereby offering therapeutic potential in hypertension-induced cardiac dysfunction.© 2019 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531065>Effects of Some Lamiaceae Species on NO Production and Cell Injury in Hydrogen Peroxide-induced Stress.</a></h2><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a key mediator that plays an important role in pathogenesis of various chronic diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, there is a great attitude for finding natural compounds, which could control and inhibit NO production in pathological conditions.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade  through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH. More studies are needed in humans to elicit the effect of positive airway pressure therapy on gut dysbiosis.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500508>SQSTM1-dependent autophagic degradation of PKM2 inhibits the production of mature IL1B/IL-1β and contributes to LIPUS-mediated anti-inflammatory effect.</a></h2><p>Synovitis is implicated in the pathology of osteoarthritis (OA) and significantly contributes to the development of OA. As a noninvasive physical therapy, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory effect in recent years. However, the role of LIPUS on synovitis of OA and the underlying mechanisms are little known. The present study showed that LIPUS ameliorated synovial  in destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model and air pouch model, and alleviated pain gait patterns of DMM mouse. LIPUS dramatically inhibited the production of mature IL1B/IL-1β (interleukin 1 beta)  and . In addition, LIPUS upregulated the macroautophagy/autophagy level as well as accelerated the formation of an SQSTM1 (sequestosome1)-PKM (pyruvate kinase, muscle) complex in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-treated macrophages. Besides, LIPUS downregulated the level of PKM2 in LPS-ATP-treated macrophages, which could be reversed by SQSTM1 knockdown. In brief, the present study for the first time demonstrates that LIPUS inhibits the production of mature IL1B partially via SQSTM1-dependent autophagic degradation of PKM2 in LPS-ATP-treated macrophages, which may further ameliorate the synovial  and gait patterns in animal models.

"Thunderstorm" asthma, too, is attributed to bursting grass pollens. Additional biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are identified here. Essential oils' BVOCs are inhaled from plants, oil diffusers, candles, room "fresheners", perfumes, and hygiene products. Claims of BVOC "safety" for sensitive respiratory systems are questioned.  Fourteen volunteers, of mixed-age and gender, with seasonal asthma recorded peak expiratory flow (PEF) and 11 symptom scores. BVOCs were collected on Tenax tubes from ambient air in autumn and spring, as were live flower emissions, before and after a thunderstorm. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis identified frequently occurring BVOCs. Air spora, meteorological, outdoor air pollution variables, and BVOCs predict respiratory symptoms in univariate linear regression models, seasonally.  Increased pinene, camphor, linalool, linalyl , benzaldehyde, and benzoic acid predict respiratory symptoms, including reduced PEF, and increased nasal congestion; day length, atmospheric pressure and temperature predict symptoms in both seasons, differently; other variables predict a range of symptoms (0.0001≤≤0.05). Thunder predicts different BVOC emissions in spring, compared to autumn (≤0.05). An uncut  flower emitted linalool and hexenal before a storm; the latter is also emitted from cut grass. Increased nitrogen oxides and pinene in autumn may combine to form harmful oxidation products.  This research supports BVOCs as contributors to seasonal asthma and allergic rhinitis, and "thunderstorm" asthma. Pinene emissions from Myrtaceae species (), Brassicaceae (canola), and conifers, worldwide, may induce respiratory  and maintain it, by inhibiting eosinophilic apoptosis. Widely used essential oil products containing BVOCs, like linalool, are associated here with respiratory symptoms.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic  and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs , propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon.

Here we want to observe if PKC can regulate the expression of Nav1.9 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pain model. A chronic knee joint  model was produced by intra-articular injection of the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in rats. Nociceptive behaviors including mechanical, cold, and heat hyperalgesia were examined. The expression of Nav1.9 and PKCα in DRG was detected by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. The in vitro and in vivo effects of a PKC activator (phorbol 12-myristate 13- [PMA]) and a PKC inhibitor (GF-109203X) on the expression of Nav1.9 were examined. Moreover, the effects of PKC modulators on nociceptive behaviors were studied. Increased mechanical, heat, and cold sensitivity was observed 3 to 14 days after CFA injection. Parallel increases in messenger RNA and protein expression of Nav1.9 and PKCα were found. Immunofluorescence experiments found that Nav1.9 was preferentially colocalized with IB4+DRG neurons in RA rats. In cultured DRG neurons, PMA increased Nav1.9 expression while GF-109203X prevented the effect of PMA. PMA increased Nav1.9 expression in naïve rats while GF-109203X decreased Nav1.9 expression in RA rats. In naïve rats, PMA caused mechanical and cold hyperalgesia. On the other hand, GF-109203X attenuated mechanical and cold hyperalgesia in RA-pain model.

Radiation was applied with red LED (660 nm, 215 mW, 84.64 mW/cm, 2.531 J/cm (30s); 5.07 J/cm (60s) 7.61 J/cm (90s) and 10.15 J/cm (120 s)). The red LED applied 60 s before the experiments, promoted reduction of the nociceptive neurogenic (1st phase) and inflammatory pain (2nd phase) induced by intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of formalin. This effect duration in the second phase was 180 min after pretreatment of the LED. Red LED also reduced nociception induced by intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid. Furthermore, red LED prevented nociception induced by i.pl. injection of cinnamaldehyde, capsaicin, menthol and acidified saline.

To induce AD, the dorsal skins of mice were treated with 5% TMA on day 0 and both ears were treated with 5% TMA on day 5 and with 2% TMA from day 6 to day 14. JC3 (1, 5, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) was treated once daily from day 9 to day 14 before TMA treatment. Histological analysis was performed and auricular lymph node weights, ear thicknesses, skin water contents, scratching behaviors, and serum immunoglobulin (IgE) and IFN-γ, and interleukin-4 (IL-4) levels in serum and ear tissues were determined. In addition, the anti-AD activity of JC3 was investigated on phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-stimulated human mast cells (HMC-1 cells) derived from patients. Levels of TNF-α, IL-4, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were investigated after treating cultured cells with JC3.

Members of the ERBB receptor family are important regulators of skin development and homeostasis and, when dysregulated, contribute to skin pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 2 (LRIG2), a transmembrane protein involved in feedback loop regulation of the ERBB receptor family during NMSC. LRIG2 was identified to be up-regulated in various types of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but little is known about LRIG2 in cutaneous SCC (cSCC). To investigate the function of LRIG2 in cSCC in vivo, we generated a skin-specific LRIG2 overexpressing transgenic mouse line (LRIG2-TG) using the Tet-Off system. We employed the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene/12-O-tetra-decanoylphorbol-13- (DMBA/TPA) two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model and analyzed the skin during homeostasis and tumorigenesis. LRIG2-TG mice did not exhibit alterations in skin development or homeostasis but showed an interaction between LRIG2 and thrombospondin-1, which is often involved in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. However, during carcinogenesis, transgenic animals showed significantly increased tumor progression and a more rapid development of cSCC. This was accompanied by changes in the ERBB system. After a single TPA application,  of the epidermis was enhanced during LRIG2 overexpression. In human skin samples, LRIG2 expression was identified in the basal layer of the epidermis and in hair follicles of normal skin, but also in cSCC samples. In conclusion, epidermal LRIG2 excess is associated with activated EGFR/ERBB4-MAPK signaling and accelerated tumor progression in experimentally induced NMSC, suggesting LRIG2 as a potential oncoprotein in skin.© 2019 The Authors.

In this context, flower extracts of  L.-a traditional medicinal plant-were investigated in the present work. The LC-MS/MS profiling of the extracts, obtained by fractionated extraction, led to the identification of 66 constituents, mostly flavonols (quercetin and sexangularetin glycosides with dominating isoquercitrin), pseudodepsides of quinic and shikimic acids (prevailing isomers of chlorogenic acid and cynarin), and flavanols (catechins and proanthocyanidins). Minor extract components of possible chemotaxonomic value were flavalignans (cinchonain I isomers) and phenylamides (spermidine derivatives). As assessed by HPLC-PDA and UV-spectrophotometric studies, the extracts were polyphenol-abundant, with the contents up to 597.6 mg/g dry weight (dw), 333.9 mg/g dw, 382.0 mg/g dw, and 169.0 mg/g dw of total phenolics, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and caffeoylquinic acids, respectively. Their biological  effects were phenolic-dependent and the strongest for diethyl ether, ethyl , and -butanol fractions of the methanol-water (7 : 3, /) extract. The extracts showed significant, concentration-dependent ability to scavenge -relevant radical/oxidant agents (O , OH, HO, ONOO, NO, and HClO) with the strongest effects towards OH, ONOO, HClO, and O  (compared to ascorbic acid). Moreover, the extracts efficiently inhibited lipoxygenase and hyaluronidase (compared to indomethacin) but were inactive towards xanthine oxidase. At -relevant levels (1-5 g/mL), they also effectively protected human plasma components (proteins and lipids) against ONOO-induced oxidative damage (reduced the levels of 3-nitrotyrosine, lipid hydroperoxides, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) and normalised/enhanced the total nonenzymatic antioxidant capacity of plasma. In cytotoxicity tests, the extracts did not affect the viability of human PBMCs and might be regarded as safe.

In addition to echocardiographic, metabolic and hemodynamic analyses, immunohistochemistry and RNAseq were performed on left ventricular tissue. Obesity negatively affected cardiac output, led to an elevated E/e' ratio and mildly reduced ejection fraction. DS-induced hypertension did not affect cardiac output and minimally elevated E/e' ratio. Diastolic derangements in placebo-treated obese rats developed in absence of  and fibrosis, yet in presence of oxidative stress and hypertrophic remodelling. In contrast, hypertension triggered apoptosis,  and fibrosis, with limited synergy of the comorbidities observed for  and fibrosis. Transcriptional data suggested that these comorbidities exerted opposite effects on mitochondrial function. In placebo-treated obese rats, genes involved in fatty acid metabolism were up-regulated, whereas DS-induced a down-regulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation.

After receiving the T. serrulatus venom (TsV, 0.8 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, the animals were treated intravenously with the aqueous extract (20, 30 and 40 mg/kg), the arachnid antivenom (50 μL/animal), the dichloromethane, ethyl  and n-butanol fractions (20 mg/kg) as well as rutin and chlorogenic acid (2, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg). The treatment with the aqueous extract, fractions and phenolic compounds decreased the migration of leukocytes to the peritoneal cavity and reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12. Moreover, the pulmonary histopathologic analysis showed a reduction in both interstitial and alveolar edema, as well as in the leukocytes infiltration and vascular ectasia in the mice's lungs, which evidences a protective effect attributed to H. speciosa. This is the first study that demonstrates the inhibitory potential of the aqueous extract from H. speciosa fruits against  induced by TsV.

Follow up experiments with selected bioactive molecules from the plant (α-amyrin, β-caryophylline, scopoletin, vanillic acid, trans-ferulic acid, and spilanthol) indicated that the N-alkamide, spilanthol, is responsible for the NO-suppressive effects and provides protection from NO-dependent cell death. Spilanthol reduced the expression of iNOS mRNA and protein and, as a possible underlying mechanism, inhibited the activation of several transcription factors (NFκB, ATF4, FOXO1, IRF1, ETS, and AP1) and sensitized cells to downregulation of Smad (TF array experiments). The iNOS inhibitory effect translated into an anti-inflammatory effect, as demonstrated in a phorbol 12-myristate 13--induced dermatitis and, to a smaller extent, in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. In summary, we demonstrate that spilanthol inhibits iNOS expression, NO production and suppresses inflammatory TFs. These events likely contribute to the observed anti-inflammatory actions of spilanthol in dermatitis and pancreatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496781>Inhibition of nitric oxide production and free radical scavenging activities of four South African medicinal plants.</a></h2><p>Traditional healing is often the preferred form of therapy especially in rural and resource-limited communities. The extracts of plants are used to treat many diseases such as arthritis and chronic pain. Four medicinal plant species, namely,  and  used in Southern Africa to treat pain and -related diseases were selected for evaluation in laboratory-based experiments.The selected plant species were evaluated for phytochemical content, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as cytotoxicity effects against mammalian cells in culture.The results indicated that the -hexane and chloroform extracts of  had the best antioxidant activities with an IC=0.41 μg/mL. Also, the acetone extracts of  had 93.76% nitric oxide (NO) inhibition. However, the chloroform and -hexane extracts of  produced NO inhibition of 98.53% and 99.2%, respectively, at 100 μg/mL with IC=17.69 μg/mL. Furthermore, the ethyl  extracts also had promising NO inhibitory activity (96.33%), but the cytotoxicity results with cell viabilities of 5.31%, 5.7% and 5.89%, respectively, suggested that the observed activity was due to a cytotoxic effect. Acetone extracts of  were also cytotoxic at 30 µg/mL with 6.07-6.67% cell viabilities compared with the acetone extracts of  (99.57%).The results partially validate the ethnomedicinal uses of the selected plant species used for -related conditions. However, because some of the extracts had potential cytotoxic effects, caution is advised in their use, especially those consumed orally.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31239660>Ocular anti-inflammatory activity of prednisolone  loaded chitosan-deoxycholate self-assembled nanoparticles.</a></h2><p> Conventional topical ophthalmic aqueous solutions and suspensions are often associated with low bioavailability and high administration frequency, pulsatile dose and poor exposure to certain ocular parts. The aim of this study was to develop an ophthalmic nanoparticles loaded gel, for delivering prednisolone  (PA), to increase dosing accuracy, bioavailability, and accordingly, efficiency of PA in treating inflammatory ocular diseases.  A novel formulation of self-assembled nanoparticles was prepared by the complexation of chitosan (CS) and, the counter-ion, sodium deoxycholate (SD), loaded with the poorly-water-soluble PA. Particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading content (LC) of prepared nanoparticles were assessed. Moreover, the nanoparticles were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Drug release and eye anti-inflammatory potential of the prepared novel formulation was investigated.  Mean particle size of the nanoparticles have dropped from 976 nm ±43 (PDI 1.285) to 480 nm ±28 (PDI 1.396) when the ratio of CS-SD was decreased. The incorporation of 0.1-0.3% of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), in the preparation stages, resulted in smaller nanoparticles: 462 nm ±19 (PDI 0.942) and 321 nm ±22 (PDI 0.454) respectively. DSC and FTIR results demonstrated the interaction between CS and SD, however, no interactions were detected between PA and CS or SD. Drug release of PA as received, in simulated tears fluid (pH 7.4), showed a twofold increase (reaching an average of 98.6% in 24 hours) when incorporated into an optimized nanoparticle gel formulation (1:5 CS-SD).  The anti-inflammatory effect of PA nanoparticles loaded gel on female guinea pig eyes was significantly superior to that of the micronized drug loaded gel ( < 0.05).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802641>Distribution of the anti-inflammatory and anti-depressant compounds: Incensole and incensole  in genus Boswellia.</a></h2><p>Incensole and its  have shown anti-inflammatory and anti-depression activities due to their ability to activate ion channels in the brain to alleviate anxiety or depression. The natural occurrence of these two structurally and medicinally fascinating 14-membered diterpenoids was reported mainly from the genus Boswellia. Incensole and incensole  were detected in and isolated from both essential oils and resins of frankincense. One total synthesis was reported for incensole. Both incensole and its  served as precursors for several synthetic transformations. Given the fact that no specific enzymes were isolated from Boswellia trees, the major sources for incensole and incensole , the biosynthetic pathway of these two compounds was only speculated. Recent studies on incensole and incensole  including ours have revealed another secret of the ancient drug. Understanding their mode of action will open a door in modern neurobiology and provides new insights on the mysterious diseases of the nervous system.

SAMPLE Surfactant samples obtained from 6 horses with severe asthma and 7 healthy horses. PROCEDURES Clinical evaluation of horses and surfactant analysis were performed. Samples obtained from horses with severe asthma and healthy horses before (baseline), during, and after exposure to hay were analyzed. Crude surfactant pellets were dried prior to dissolution in a solution of isopropanol:methanol:chloroform (4:2:1) containing 7.5mM ammonium . Shotgun lipidomics were performed by use of high-resolution data acquisition on an ion-trap mass spectrometer. Findings were analyzed by use of an ANOVA with a Tukey-Kramer post hoc test. RESULTS Results of lipidomic analysis were evaluated to detect significant differences between groups of horses and among exposure statuses within groups of horses. Significantly increased amounts of cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA) and diacylglycerol (DAG) were detected in surfactant from severely asthmatic horses during exposure to hay, compared with baseline and postexposure concentrations. Concentrations of cPA and DAG did not change significantly in healthy horses regardless of exposure status. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE cPA 16:0 and DAG 36:2 were 2 novel lipid mediators identified in surfactant obtained from asthmatic horses with clinical disease. These molecules were likely biomarkers of sustained . Further studies are needed to evaluate a possible correlation with disease severity and potential alterations in the plasma lipidomic profile of horses with asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450704>Romanian Wormwood ( L.): Physicochemical and Nutraceutical Screening.</a></h2><p> species are used worldwide for their antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. This research was designed to investigate the phytochemical profile of two ethanolic extracts obtained from leaves and stems of  L. as well as the biological potential (antioxidant activity, cytotoxic, anti-migratory and anti-inflammatory properties). Both plant materials showed quite similar thermogravimetric, FT-IR phenolic profile (high chlorogenic acid) with mild antioxidant capacity [ascorbic acid (0.02-0.1) > leaves (0.1-2.0) > stem (0.1-2.0)]. Alcoholic extracts from these plant materials showed a cytotoxic effect against A375 (melanoma) and MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma) and affected less the non-malignant HaCaT cells (human keratinocytes) at 72 h post-stimulation and this same trend was observed in the anti-migratory (A375, MCF7 > HaCat) assay.

Abelmoschus manihot (AM) extracted from Flos Abelmoschus manihot that has been applied for treating chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we showed that AM significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice. AM modified gut microbiota composition, increased microbial diversity, and in particularly, elevated the abundance of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing gut microbiota in colitic mice. Consequently, levels of SCFAs especially butyrate and  were increased upon AM treatment, which, primarily through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) pathway, led to the enhanced Treg generation and the suppressed Th17 development. Together, we herein provide the first evidences to support that AM, a natural plant-derived complex, can potentially reset gut microbiome and metabolism, resume immune and tissue homeostasis, and hence prevent colitis, which may provide a new perspective on IBD pathogenesis and suggest a novel microbiota-targeting therapy for inflammatory gut diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The effects of e-beam irradiation on the microbial load, stability of the active components, and anti-inflammatory activity of medicinal herbs were determined. We observed that the total aerobic bacteria (TAB; 4.0-7.0 log CFU/g), yeasts and molds (Y&M; 3.3-6.8 log CFU/g), and coliform counts (CC; 3.2-3.8 log CFU/g) in both herb samples were effectively reduced in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in acceptable levels of <3.0 log CFU/g in TAB and Y&M and negative in CC at 10 kGy irradiation. The concentration of the active components (0.87-4.22 mg/g) of Cnidii Rhizoma, including z-ligustilide, chlorogenic acid, senkyunolide A, and ferulic acid, in order of prevalence and those (0.86-2.76 mg/g) of Alismatis Rhizoma, including Alisol B  and Alisol B, were not changed at irradiation doses of ≤10 kGy. The extracts of e-beam irradiated Cnidii Rhizoma and Alismatis Rhizoma showed a reduced production of inflammation-related factors, such as nitric oxide, prostaglandin E, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, in a concentration-dependent manner, which was induced by lipopolysaccharide in RAW 264.7 . However, there was no significant difference observed at e-beam irradiation doses of 0, 1, 5, and 10 kGy. Thus, we confirm that e-beam irradiation up to 10 kGy was effective for the control of microbial load in Cnidii Rhizoma and Alismatis Rhizoma without causing considerable changes in their major active components and anti-inflammatory activity.

Long-term exposure of rats to lead resulted in its accumulation in kidney. The accumulated metal impaired kidney function and structure. Lead intoxication resulted in oxidative stress,  and apoptosis in kidney. In addition, it resulted in nitric oxide (NO) overproduction and decrease in hydrogen sulfide (H2S) level and heme oxygenase (HO-1) concentration in kidney. Inhibition of NO overproduction by L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and increasing of H2S level by sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and CO level by carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-A (CORM-A) inhibited lead-induced impairment of kidney function and structure. These agents inhibited lead-intoxication induced oxidative stress, , apoptosis, nitrosative stress and reduction of H2S level and HO-1 concentration. Also, concomitant treatment with these agents inhibited lead intoxication-induced increase in protein expressions of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and caspase-3 as well as decrease in protein expressions of HO-1 and cystathionine- γ-lyase (CSE) in kidney. The NO donor, L-arginine and the HS and CO biosynthesis inhibitors, trifluoro-DL-alanine and zinc deutroporphyrin, respectively produced opposite effects and aggravated the toxic effects of lead. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that gasotransmitters play an important role in lead-induced nephrotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, IL-23 blockers are ineffective in axial  in man. This study investigated γδT-cell subsets in the normal human enthesis to explore the biology of the IL-23/17 axis.Human spinous processes entheseal soft tissue (EST) and peri-entheseal bone (PEB) were harvested during elective orthopaedic procedures. Entheseal γδT-cells were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and isolated and characterised using flow cytometry. RNA was isolated from γδT-cell subsets and analysed by qPCR. Entheseal γδT-cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and ionomycin, anti-CD3/28 or IL-23 and IL-17A production was measured by high-sensitivity ELISA and qPCR.Entheseal γδT-cells were confirmed immunohistochemically with Vδ1 and Vδ2 subsets that are cytometrically defined. Transcript profiles of both cell populations suggested tissue residency and immunomodulatory status. Entheseal Vδ2 cells expressed high relative abundance of IL-23/17-associated transcripts including IL-23R, RORC and CCR6, whereas the Vδ1 subset almost completely lacked detectable IL-23R transcript. Following PMA stimulation IL-17A was detectable in both Vδ1 and Vδ2 subsets, and following CD3/CD28 stimulation both subsets showed IL-17A and IL-17F transcripts with neither transcript being detectable in the Vδ1 subset following IL-23 stimulation.Spinal entheseal Vδ1 and Vδ2 subsets are tissue resident cells with inducible IL-17A production with evidence that the Vδ1 subset does so independently of IL-23R expression.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Although certain agents have shown clinical success in treating psoriasis, development of safe and effective strategies for the treatment of this condition remains important. Research suggests that DNA topoisomerase I (Topo I) inhibitors may have potent psoriasis-ameliorating effects. Here, 25 quinoline derivatives were synthesized and identified as Topo I inhibitors. These compounds inhibited the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13--induced mouse ear . The most potent analogs, 5i and 5l, suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated HaCaT cells. Additionally, the lead compounds significantly improved imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like  in mice. Moreover, the expression levels of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-22, IL-23, nuclear factor-κB subunit p65, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ, were dramatically inhibited in the dorsal skin of 5i- and 5l-treated mice.

Nevertheless, during the past decade, there have been a growing number of publications focused on human genetics, the gut microbiome, and proteomics, suggesting that loss of mucosal barrier function, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, may substantially affect antigen trafficking, ultimately causing chronic , including autoimmunity, in genetically predisposed individuals. The gut mucosa works as a semipermeable barrier in that it permits nutrient absorption and also regulates immune surveillance while retaining potentially harmful microbes and environmental antigens within the intestinal lumen. Celiac disease (CD), a systemic, immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, is associated with altered gut permeability. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that gliadin, a prolamine component of gluten that is implicated in CD pathogenesis, is capable to disassembling intercellular junctional proteins by upregulating the zonulin pathway, which can be inhibited by the zonulin antagonist larazotide . In this review, we will focus on CD as a paradigm of chronic inflammatory diseases in order to outline the contribution of gut paracellular permeability toward disease pathogenesis; moreover, we will summarize current evidence derived from available clinical trials of larazotide  in CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887214> and fibrosis in murine models of heart failure.</a></h2><p>Heart failure is a consequence of various cardiovascular diseases and associated with poor prognosis.

Here,  and fibrosis are thought to play crucial roles. During cardiac , immune cells invade the cardiac tissue and modulate tissue-damaging responses. Cardiac fibrosis, however, is characterised by an increased amount and a disrupted composition of extracellular matrix proteins. As evidence exists that cardiac  and fibrosis are potentially reversible in experimental and clinical set ups, they are interesting targets for innovative heart failure treatments. In this context, animal models are important as they mimic clinical conditions of heart failure patients. The advantages of mice in this respect are short generation times and genetic modifications. As numerous murine models of heart failure exist, the selection of a proper disease model for a distinct research question is demanding. To facilitate this selection, this review aims to provide an overview about the current understanding of the pathogenesis of cardiac  and fibrosis in six frequently used murine models of heart failure.

In this study, it was aimed to develop and characterize boron (B) modified bioactive glass nanoparticles (BG-NPs) containing cellulose /oxidized pullulan/gelatin (CA/ox-PULL/GEL) three dimensional scaffolds with tubular morphology for dentin regeneration. 3D nanobiocomposite structures were prepared by thermally induced phase separation and porogen leaching methods and characterized by in vitro degradation analysis, water absorption (WA) capacity measurement, SEM, in vitro biomineralization analysis, porosity measurement and mechanical tests. Scaffolds lost about (30-40)% of their weight during one month and WA capacity decreased with increase in immersion time in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) during one month. According to SEM, aligned and tubular structures were formed with mean diameter of about 11 μm, and BG-NPS were distributed evenly in all parts of the scaffolds. Scaffolds (without BG-NPs) possessed the highest porosity percentage. Addition of 10% BG-NPs improved the mechanical properties of scaffolds. Scaffolds surfaces were fully covered by calcium phosphate (Ca-P) deposits after conditioning in simulated body fluid for 14 days with higher quantity of deposition in groups with inclusion of B-BG-NPs. Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) were isolated from third molar teeth and used in cell culture studies. In all groups, cells adhered well 1 day after culture. Group B14-10 showed a slight increase of proliferation than group (without BG-NPs) after 7 days of incubation. Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and intracellular calcium amounts increased significantly 14 days after incubation with highest values in B14-10 and B14-20 groups. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM) analysis, showed that cells on B14-10 and B21-10 scaffold groups, spread more 14 days after culture, and they also possessed extended processes specific to odontoblasts. Alizarin Red quantification showed that the highest calcium deposition was observed on B14-10 scaffolds.

These microorganisms play a very important part in the development, functioning, and modulation of the immune system from the moment of birth. In recent years, owing to the use of modern sequencing techniques, the microbiome composition in healthy people has been identified based on bacterial 16S rRNA analysis. Currently, more and more attention is being given to the influence of microorganisms on the host's cellular metabolism. Analysis of microbial metabolites, among them short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and disruption of intestinal microbiota homeostasis in terms of their effects on molecular regulatory mechanisms of immune reactions will surely improve the understanding of the etiology of many common diseases. SCFAs, mainly butyrate, propionate, and , occur in specific amounts, and their proportions can change, depending on the diet, age and diseases. The levels of SCFAs are substantially influenced by the ratio of commensal intestinal bacteria, the disturbance of which (dysbiosis) can lead to a disproportion between the SCFAs produced. SCFAs are regarded as mediators in the communication between the intestinal microbiome and the immune system. The signal they produce is transferred, among others, in immune cells via free fatty acid receptors (FFARs), which belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It has been also confirmed that SCFAs inhibit the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) - an enzyme involved in post-translational modifications, namely the process of deacetylation and, what is new, the process of histone crotonylation. These properties of SCFAs have an effect on their immunomodulatory potential i.e. maintaining the anti/pro-inflammatory balance. SCFAs act not only locally in the intestines colonized by commensal bacteria, but also influence the intestinal immune cells, and modulate immune response by multi-protein inflammasome complexes. SCFAs have been confirmed to contribute to the maintenance of the immune homeostasis of the urinary system (kidneys), respiratory system (lungs), central nervous system, and the sight organ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332169>Microbiota-derived  protects against respiratory syncytial virus infection through a GPR43-type 1 interferon response.</a></h2><p>Severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants <2 years-old.

This study aimed to assess the effects of an ethanolic extract of Radix Paeoniae (RP) on cancer cachexia and elucidate its mechanism of action.The anti-cachexic effect and mechanism of RP were examined in mouse models of cancer cachexia established in C57BL/6 mice by subcutaneously injecting Lewis lung carcinoma or MC38 colon carcinoma cells. Skeletal muscle tissues were analysed by RNAseq, real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Megestrol , which is recommended for the treatment of cachexia in cancer patients, was used as the comparator treatment in this study.In lung and colon cancer-bearing mice, RP significantly restored food intake and muscle mass, along with muscle function measured by grip strength and treadmill running time. In the skeletal muscle tissue of the cancer-bearing mice, RP suppressed NF-κB signalling and reduced inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β; it also down-regulated the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx.RP restored skeletal muscle function and mass in cancer-bearing mice by down-regulating the muscular NF-κB signalling pathway and muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases. Our study indicates that RP is a potential candidate for development as a therapeutic agent against cancer cachexia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Increased diversity in the vaginal microbiota modulates genital  and is associated with increased HIV-1 acquisition. However, the effect of MPA on diversity of the vaginal microbiota is relatively unknown. In a cohort of female Kenyan sex workers, negative for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with Nugent scores <7 (=58 of 370 screened), MPA correlated with significantly increased diversity of the vaginal microbiota as assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. MPA was also significantly associated with decreased levels of estrogen in the plasma, and low vaginal glycogen and α-amylase, factors implicated in vaginal colonization by lactobacilli, bacteria that are believed to protect against STIs. In a humanized mouse model, MPA treatment was associated with low serum estrogen, low glycogen and enhanced HIV-1 susceptibility. The mechanism by which the MPA-mediated changes in the vaginal microbiota may contribute to HIV-1 susceptibility in humans appears to be independent of inflammatory cytokines and/or activated T cells. Altogether, these results suggest MPA-induced hypo-estrogenism may alter key metabolic components that are necessary for vaginal colonization by certain bacterial species including lactobacilli, and allow for greater bacterial diversity in the vaginal microbiota.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.© 2019.

This study investigated the role of anhydroglucitol-core gallotannins (ACGs) in apoptosis increase of human blood neutrophils treated by the hot water extract from red maple buds (RMB). Fractions obtained by liquid-liquid partitioning (ethyl , butanol and water-remaining fractions) of the hot water extract from RMB were assessed for their effects on neutrophil viability by using flow cytometry. These fractions were then phytochemically analyzed to investigate the ability of major compounds to induce neutrophil apoptosis individually. Ethyl  and butanol fractions that contained the major ACGs ginnalin A, ginnalin 3,6 and ginnalin C stimulated the apoptosis of neutrophils. The three ACGs at 100 μM significantly increased the rate of the late apoptotic cells. When differentially combined, these ACGs have additive or antagonist effects. These effects are related to the concentrations of the constituents in the mixtures studied, especially so for ginnalin C. GinA increased FADD, phospho-Rad17, SMAC/Diablo and cytochrome C, while decreasing the anti-apoptotic protein catalase. These compounds could be useful for the development of novel therapeutic approaches that facilitate resolution of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, whether UCB-MSCs have immunomodulatory effects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory cytokine secretion in macrophages and whether it is involved in phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway remain unclear. After co-culture of UCB-MSCs and phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-activated human THP-1 cells using a transwell system, it showed that LPS significantly induced increases in the expression levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 37 (IL-37), phospho-PI3K (p-PI3K), and phospho-Akt (p-Akt) in macrophages. UCB-MSCs upregulated the expression of IL-10, IL-37, p-PI3K, and p-Akt, while it had no obvious effect on PI3K and Akt levels. Inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002) significantly suppressed the expression of IL-10, IL-37, p-PI3K, and p-Akt; however, it had no effect on the expression levels of PI3K and Akt.

Here, the mechanisms of prominent endotoxin (LPS) tolerance in FcGRIIb-/- mice were explored on bone marrow-derived macrophages using phosphoproteomic analysis. As such, LPS tolerance decreased several phosphoproteins in the FcGRIIb-/- macrophage, including protein kinase C-β type II (PRKCB), which was associated with phagocytosis function. Overexpression of PRKCB attenuated LPS tolerance in RAW264.7 cells, supporting the role of this gene in LPS tolerance. In parallel, LPS tolerance in macrophages and in mice was attenuated by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) administration. This treatment induced several protein kinase C families, including PRKCB. However, PMA attenuated the severity of mice with cecal ligation and puncture on LPS tolerance preconditioning in FcGRIIb-/- but not in wild-type cells. The significant reduction of PRKCB in the FcGRIIb-/- macrophage over wild-type cell possibly induced the more severe LPS-exhaustion and increased the infection susceptibility in FcGRIIb-/- mice. PMA induced PRKCB, improved LPS-tolerance, and attenuated sepsis severity, predominantly in FcGRIIb-/- mice. PRKCB enhancement might be a promising strategy to improve macrophage functions in lupus patients with LPS-tolerance from chronic infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565644>An Overview of Therapeutic Options in Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system (CNS).

As folic acid (FA) is a nutrient essential for modulating DNA methylation, we sought to determine how maternal FA intake during early pregnancy might influence tumor sensitivity in an offspring. Dams were maintained on a FA-depleted (FA(-)) or normal (2 mg FA/kg; FA(+)) diet from 2 to 3 days before mating to 7 days post-conception, and their offspring were challenged with chemical tumorigenesis using 7,12-dimethylbenz[a)anthracene and phorbol 12-myristate 13- for skin and 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide for tongue. In both squamous tissues, tumorigenesis was more progressive in the offspring from FA(-) than FA(+) dams. Notably, in the skin of FA(-) offspring, the expression and activity of cylindromatosis (Cyld) were decreased due to the altered DNA methylation status in its promoter region, which contributed to increased tumorigenesis coupled with  in the FA(-) offspring. Thus, we conclude that maternal FA insufficiency during early pregnancy is able to promote neoplasm progression in the offspring through modulating DNA methylation, such as Cyld. Moreover, we propose, for the first time, "innate" utero nutrition as the third cause of tumorigenesis besides the known causes-hereditary predisposition and acquired environmental factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30696844>Novel benzofuran derivative DK-1014 attenuates lung  via blocking of MAPK/AP-1 and AKT/mTOR signaling in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Benzofuran derivatives have wide range of biological activities as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticonvulsant agent. In this study, we investigated whether the novel benzofuran derivative, DK-1014 has the anti-inflammatory effects on macrophage and lung epithelial cells and anti-asthmatic effects on ovalbumin-treated mice. A series of 2-arylbenzofuran analogues were synthesized and evaluated for NO and interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibition in LPS-stimulated Raw264.7 cells. Of these analogues, compounds 8, 22a, 22d, and 22 f (DK-1014) exhibited notable inhibitory activity with respect to IL-6 and NO production. In particular, compound DK-1014 strongly reduced IL-6, IL-8, and MMP-9 mRNA expression and IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 production in phorbol myristate  stimulated A549 cells, reduced MAPKs phosphorylation and c-fos translocation, and attenuated AKT, p70S6K and GSK phosphorylation. In vivo experiments were also performed on ovalbumin-sensitized and challenged BALB/c mice. DK-1014 reduced the airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammatory cell counts and cytokine levels (IL-4, 5, 13) in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and immunoglobulin E in serum, and attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus hypersecretion in lung tissue. These findings indicate that DK-1014 can protect against allergic airway  through the AP-1 and AKT/mTOR pathways and could be useful source for the development of a therapeutic agent for asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894323>Differential induction of nuclear factor-like 2 signature genes with toll-like receptor stimulation.</a></h2><p> is associated with production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and results in the induction of thioredoxin (TXN) and peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) and activation of nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2). In this study we have used the mouse RAW 264.7 macrophage and the human THP-1 monocyte cell line to investigate the pattern of expression of three Nrf2 target genes, PRDX1, TXN reductase (TXNRD1) and heme oxygenase (HMOX1), by activation of different Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We found that, while the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces all three genes, the pattern of induction with agonists for TLR1/2, TLR3, TLR2/6 and TLR7/8 differs depending on the gene and the cell line. In all cases, the extent of induction was HMOX1>TXNRD1>PRDX1. Since LPS was a good inducer of all genes in both cell lines, we studied the mechanisms mediating LPS induction of the three genes using mouse RAW 264.7 cells. To assess the role of ROS we used the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Only LPS induction of HMOX1 was inhibited by NAC while that of TXNRD1 and PRDX1 was unaffected. These three genes were also induced by phorbol myristate  (PMA), a ROS-inducer acting by activation of protein kinase C (PKC). The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine inhibited the induction of all three genes by PMA but only that of HMOX1 by LPS. This indicates that activation of these genes by inflammatory agents is regulated by different mechanisms involving either ROS or protein kinases, or both.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

White blood cells have been implicated as critical mediators of this inflammatory injury. Currently, no medications have been clinically proven to ameliorate or beneficially modulate , or to improve outcomes by any mechanism, following ICH. However, other neuroinflammatory conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, have approved pharmacologic therapies that modulate the inflammatory response and minimize the damage caused by inflammatory cells. Thus, there is substantial interest in existing therapies for neuroinflammation and their potential applicability to other acute neurological diseases such as ICH. In this review, we examined the mechanism of action of twelve currently approved medications for multiple sclerosis: alemtuzumab, daclizumab, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, glatiramer , interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, rituximab, teriflunomide. We analyzed the existing literature pertaining to the effects of these medications on various leukocytes and also with emphasis on mechanisms of action during the acute period following initiation of therapy. As a result, we provide a valuable summary of the current body of knowledge regarding these therapies and evidence that supports or refutes their likely promise for treating neuroinflammation following ICH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615657>Overexpression of myeloid angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) reduces atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are ubiquitous in all stages of atherosclerosis, exerting tremendous impact on lesion progression and plaque stability. Because macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques express angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), current dogma posits that local myeloid-mediated effects worsen the disease. In contrast, we previously reported that myeloid ACE overexpression augments macrophage resistance to various immune challenges, including tumors, bacterial infection and Alzheimer's plaque deposition. Here, we sought to assess the impact of myeloid ACE on atherosclerosis.A mouse model in which ACE is overexpressed in myelomonocytic lineage cells, called ACE10, was generated and sequentially crossed with ApoE-deficient mice to create ACEApoE (ACE10/ApoE). Control mice were ACEApoE (WT/ApoE). Atherosclerosis was induced using an atherogenic diet alone, or in combination with unilateral nephrectomy plus deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA) salt for eight weeks.With an atherogenic diet alone or in combination with DOCA, the ACE10/ApoE mice showed significantly less atherosclerotic plaques compared to their WT/ApoE counterparts (p < 0.01). When recipient ApoE mice were reconstituted with ACE bone marrow, these mice showed significantly reduced lesion areas compared to recipients reconstituted with wild type bone marrow. Furthermore, transfer of ACE-deficient bone marrow had no impact on lesion area.Our data indicate that while myeloid ACE may not be required for atherosclerosis, enhanced ACE expression paradoxically reduced disease progression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Because the available treatments for psoriasis have significant limitations, dietary products are potential natural sources of therapeutic molecules, which can repair the molecular defects associated with psoriasis and could possibly be developed for its management. Fisetin (3,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone), a phytochemical naturally found in pigmented fruits and vegetables, has demonstrated proapoptotic and antioxidant effects in several malignancies. This study utilized biochemical, cellular, pharmacological, and tissue engineering tools to characterize the effects of fisetin on normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and CD4+ T lymphocytes in 2D and 3D psoriasis-like disease models. Fisetin treatment of NHEKs dose- and time-dependently induced differentiation and inhibited interleukin-22-induced proliferation, as well as activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Fisetin treatment of TNF-α stimulated NHEKs also significantly inhibited the activation of p38 and JNK, but had enhanced effect on ERK1/2 (MAPK). In addition, fisetin treatment significantly decreased the secretion of Th1/Th-17 pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN-γ and IL-17A by 12--tetradecanolylphorbol 13- (TPA)-stimulated NHEKs and anti-CD3/CD28-activated human PBMCs. Furthermore, we established the in vivo relevance of fisetin functions, using a 3D full-thickness human skin model of psoriasis (FTRHSP) that closely mimics in vivo human psoriatic skin lesions. Herein, fisetin significantly ameliorated psoriasis-like disease features, and decreased the production of IL-17 by CD4+ T lymphocytes co-cultured with FTRHSP. Collectively, our data identify the prodifferentiative, antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory effects of fisetin, via modulation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and p38/JNK pathways and the production of cytokines in 2D and 3D human skin models of psoriasis.

In this study, we intend to investigate the antineuroinflammatory and anti-PD-like effects of the bioactive fraction/candidate of the SE extract. Initially, we screened various fractions of SE extract using an  antioxidant assay. The optimal fraction was investigated for its  antineuroinflammatory potential in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells and  anti-PD-like potential in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Subsequently, to identify the potential candidate responsible for the elite therapeutic potential of the optimal fraction, we conducted antioxidant activity-guided isolation and purification; the bioactive candidate was structurally characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and chromatographic techniques and further investigated for its  antioxidative and antineuroinflammatory potential. The results of our study indicate that SE-EA and its bioactive candidate, Irilin B, effectively alleviate the deleterious effect of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and promote antioxidative effects.

Although their population contributes only to approximately 1-6% of all leucocytes present in the human blood, they possess a wide range of specific functions. They play a key role in -regulating processes, when their numbers can increased to above 5 × 10 /l of peripheral blood. Their characteristic feature is the presence of granules containing eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), the release of which can trigger a cascade of events promoting oxidative stress, apoptosis or necrosis, leading finally to cell death. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique to detect EPO, which comprises a chromophore protoporphyrin IX. Another cell structure associated with  processes are lipid bodies (lipid-rich organelles), also well recognized and imaged using high resolution confocal Raman spectroscopy. In this work, eosinophils isolated from the blood of a human donor were analysed versus their model, EoL-1 human eosinophilic leukaemia cell line, by Raman spectroscopic imaging. We showed that EPO was present only in primary cells and not found in the cell line. Eosinophils were activated using phorbol 12-myristate 13-, which resulted in lipid bodies formation.

Formerly predicted as an oncogene, alterations of its expression are documented in various human cancers. However, the exact role of XB130 in tumorigenesis is unknown. To address its function in skin tumorigenesis, a two-stage dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) study was performed on XB130 knockout (KO), heterozygous (HZ) and wild-type (WT) littermate mice. DMBA/TPA-treated XB130 KO and HZ males developed a significantly higher number of epidermal tumors that were notably larger in size than did WT mice. Interestingly, DMBA/TPA-treated female mice did not show any difference in tumor multiplicity regardless of the genotypes. The skin tumor lesions of XB130 KO males were more progressed with an increased frequency of keratoacanthoma. Deficiency of XB130 dramatically increased epidermal tumor cell proliferation. The responses to DMBA and TPA stimuli were also individually investigated to elucidate the mechanistic role of XB130 at different stages of tumorigenesis. DMBA-treated male XB130 KO mice showed compensatory p53-mediated stress response. TPA-treated XB130 KO males demonstrated more skin ulceration with more severe edema, enhanced cell proliferation, accumulation of infiltrating neutrophils, and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes compared with WT mice.

Inonotus sanghuang is claimed to produce general immune-potentiating and strengthening, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-microbial properties, but its effect on acute lung  and oxidative stress are not clearly understood. To determine the effect and mechanism of the polyphenols-rich ethyl  fraction from wild I. sanghuang extract (ISE) on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by bleomycin (BLM), female C57BL/6 mice were fed ISE (0%, 0.15% or 0.6% in diet) for 4 weeks prior to challenge with BLM. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from lung, spleen and lung tissues were collected on day 3 after BLM challenge for histological, oxidative stress, molecular and biochemical analysis. ISE supplementation improved pathological features in lung injury scores and reduced lung wet-to-dry ratios. Moreover, ISE reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and the pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in BALF, decreased the MPO activity and the MDA level and increased the SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities in lung tissue homogenates. Further mechanism analysis demonstrated that dietary ISE inhibited NF-κB signal. Finally, peripheral immune function analysis showed that ISE had less effect on immune response including splenocyte producing inflammatory cytokines and T cell proliferation except for IL-1β and IL-2. Our findings indicate the possibility that dietary ISE attenuates ALI induced by BLM through correcting the  and oxidation balance at least in part via inhibiting NF-κB signal in vivo, suggesting that ISE might be a valuable medicinal food effective in improving lung injury.Copyright © 2019.

Unfortunately, current available medications are only symptomatic without relevant reported treatment. Therefore, a pressing need for alternative safe approaches is necessitated. To this end, the present study is designed to investigate therapeutic merits of the edible plant: Ocimum kilimandscharicum (Ok), in a letrozole PCOS rat model, and compare it to metformin.PCOS rats were treated with Ok total extract and its different fractions at 100 mg/kg orally for 10 consecutive days. Moreover, phytochemical characterization was applied using HPLC/PDA/ESI-MS to identify different secondary metabolites in the bioactive fractions.Results revealed that the total extract (Ok) and ethyl  (EA) fraction improved insulin sensitivity and restored normal hormonal and lipid profiles as well as normal morphological structure of the reproductive system.

We have recently shown that the inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDAC) by low concentrations of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis), belinostat (up to 0.25 µM) and panobinostat (up to 0.04 µM) promote histone acetylation (e.g., AcH4) and neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis). Clinical use of belinostat and panobinostat often leads to neutropenia and the in vivo concentrations vary with time and tissue locations. However, the effects of different concentrations of these HDACis on neutrophil death are not fully understood. We considered that increasing concentrations of belinostat and panobinostat could alter the type of neutrophil death. To test this hypothesis, we treated human neutrophils with belinostat and panobinostat in the presence or absence of agonists that promote NOX-dependent NETosis (phorbol myristate  or lipopolysaccharide from  0128) and NOX-independent NETosis (calcium ionophores A23187 or ionomycin from ). Increasing concentrations of HDACis induced histone acetylation in a dose-dependent manner. ROS analyses showed that increasing concentrations of HDACis, increased the degree of NOX-derived ROS production. Higher levels (>1 µM belinostat and >0.2 µM panobinostat) of AcH4 resulted in a significant inhibition of spontaneous as well as the NOX-dependent and -independent NETosis. By contrast, the degree of neutrophil apoptosis significantly increased, particularly in non-activated cells. Collectively, this study establishes that increasing concentrations of belinostat and panobinostat initially increases NETosis but subsequently reduces NETosis or switches the form of cell death to apoptosis. This new information indicates that belinostat and panobinostat can induce different types of neutrophil death and may induce neutropenia and regulate  at different concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30788276>Modulation of  proliferation and cytokine secretion of human lymphocytes by  extracts.</a></h2><p> L.

Moreover, it has been suggested for the treatment of infertility-causing conditions. Its bioactive chemical constituents inhibit multiple processes, such as angiogenesis,  and invasive tissue growth, which may be beneficial in the therapy of endometriosis.We investigated the effects of Calligonum comosum on the development of endometriotic lesions.We evaluated the anti-angiogenic activity of Calligonum comosum ethyl  fraction (CCEAF) in different in vitro angiogenesis assays. Moreover, we surgically induced endometriotic lesions in BALB/c mice, which received 50 mg/kg Calligonum comosum total extract (CCTE) or vehicle (control) over 4 weeks. The growth, cyst formation, vascularization and immune cell infiltration of the lesions were assessed with high-resolution ultrasound imaging, caliper measurements, histology and immunohistochemistry.CCEAF doses of up to 10 μg/mL did not impair the viability of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC), but dose-dependently suppressed their migration, tube formation and sprouting, indicating a substantial anti-angiogenic effect of CCEAF. Furthermore, CCTE significantly inhibited the growth and cyst formation of developing murine endometriotic lesions when compared to vehicle-treated controls. This was associated with a reduced vascularization, cell proliferation and immune cell infiltration.Our findings show that Calligonum comosum targets multiple, fundamental processes in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, which may be beneficial for the treatment of this common gynecological disorder.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Practitioners of complementary medicine frequently use herbal medicines concurrently with conventional antibiotics. There is a need to evaluate their effects in combination.The bacterial growth inhibitory activity of P. angustifolium leaf extracts was assessed against a panel of pathogenic triggers of some autoimmune diseases by standard disc diffusion and liquid dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. Combinational effects between the extracts and conventional antimicrobials were classified using the sum of the fractional inhibitory concentration. Synergistic interactions were further assessed across a range of ratios by isobologram analysis. The toxicity of the individual samples and combinations was evaluated by Artemia lethality and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) human dermal fibroblast cell viability assays.P. angustifolium leaf extracts strongly inhibited the growth of several bacterial triggers of autoimmune diseases. The methanolic, aqueous and ethyl  extracts were particularly good inhibitors of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumonia growth (MIC = 26 and 57 µg/mL respectively). Some combinations of the extracts and conventional antibiotics significantly potentiated the combined inhibitory activity compared to the individual components. Of the 250 combinations studied, approximately 0.02% showed synergistic interactions, 49.6% were additive, 46.8% showed indifferent interactions and antagonism occurred in only 0.02% of the combinations. Interestingly, all of the synergistic and antagonistic combinations contained tetracycline as their antibiotic component.P. angustifolium leaf extracts inhibit the growth of pathogenic triggers of some autoimmune diseases. Some extracts also potentiated the activity of conventional antibiotics, without significantly affecting the toxicity of the combination.Copyright © 2019 Shanghai Changhai Hospital.

We previously established an IL-6 and IL-10 reporters assay that could examine reporter activity along with the reference gene in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. In this study, we described new and stable RAW 264.7 derived dual-color IL-6/gapdh and IL-10/gapdh reporters. This assay allowed us to easily determine relative IL-6 and IL-10 levels with 96-well plate within one step. We evaluated the relative IL-6 and IL-10 levels in the LPS-induced stable cells testing 52 natural products by real-time bioluminescence monitoring and time-point determination using a microplate luminometer. The relative IL-6 and IL-6/IL-10 values decreased by the crude ethanol extracts from nutmeg and by 1'S-1'-acetoxychavicol from greater galangal using real-time bioluminescence monitoring. At the same time, the relative IL-10 was induced. The relative IL-6 and IL-6/IL-10 decreased by crude ethanol extracts from nutmeg and 1'S-1'-acetoxychavicol  at 6 h. Only crude ethanol extract from nutmeg induced IL-10 at 6 h. We suggested that the use of these stable cells by real-time monitoring could serve as a screening assay for anti-inflammatory activity and may be used to discover new drugs against chronic inflammatory disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089436>Short-chain Fatty Acids Inhibit Staphylococcal Lipoprotein-induced Nitric Oxide Production in Murine Macrophages.</a></h2><p>, a Gram-positive pathogen, can cause severe  in humans, leading to various life-threatening diseases.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including butyrate, propionate, and  are microbial metabolites in the gut that are known to have anti-inflammatory effects in the host. In this study, we investigated the effects of SCFAs on  lipoprotein (Sa.LPP)-induced NO production in mouse macrophages. Butyrate and propionate, but not , inhibited Sa.LPP-induced production of NO in RAW 264.7 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Butyrate and propionate inhibited Sa.LPP-induced expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). However,  did not show such effects under the same conditions. Furthermore, butyrate and propionate, but not , inhibited Sa.LPP-induced activation of NF-κB, expression of IFN-β, and phosphorylation of STAT1, which are essential for inducing transcription of iNOS in macrophages. In addition, butyrate and propionate induced histone acetylation at lysine residues in the presence of Sa.LPP in RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, Sa.LPP-induced NO production was decreased by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Collectively, these results suggest that butyrate and propionate ameliorate the inflammatory responses caused by  through the inhibition of NF-κB, IFN-β/STAT1, and HDAC, resulting in attenuated NO production in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023186>Generation of a novel HEK293 luciferase reporter cell line by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated site-specific integration in the genome to explore the transcriptional regulation of the PGRN gene.</a></h2><p>Progranulin has multiple functions in several physiological and pathological processes, including embryonic development, wound repair, tumorigenesis,  and neurodegeneration. To investigate the transcriptional regulation of the PGRN gene, a luciferase knock-in reporter system was established in HEK293 cells by integrating luciferase gene in the genome controlled by the endogenous PGRN promoter using CRISPR/Cas9. PCR results demonstrated the site-specific integration of the exogenous luciferase gene into the genome. To validate the novel luciferase knock-in system, a CRISPR/Cas9 transcription activation/repression system for the PGRN gene was constructed and applied to the knock-in system. In addition, phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate, 13-), previously reported as activating the expression of PGRN, was applied to the system. The results indicated that luciferase activity was directly correlated with the activity of the PGRN endogenous promoter.

X-ray treated samples of the two mold species induced different responses with  displaying the most potent induction of pro-inflammatory responses. While hyphal fragments from  were more potent than spores, similar responses were produced by the two growth stages of . THP-1 Ma was the most sensitive model releasing a broad range of cytokines/chemokines. MDM exhibited a similar cytokine/chemokine profile as THP-1 Ma, except for a low-quantity release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). In contrast, AM appeared to be nonresponsive and yielded a different pattern of pro-inflammatory markers.

Several studies highlighted the pleiotropic effects of statins beyond their lipid-lowering properties. However, few studies investigated the effects of statins on T cell activation. This study evaluated the immunomodulatory capacities of three common statins, pitavastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin, in activated human T cells. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results demonstrated stronger inhibitory effects of pitavastatin on the cytokine production of T cells activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) plus ionomycin, including interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Molecular investigations revealed that pitavastatin reduced both activating protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding and transcriptional activities. Further exploration showed the selectively inhibitory effect of pitavastatin on the signaling pathways of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).

Clustering by gut microbiota revealed the existence of two communities mainly driven by diet as host properties showed little effect. Community 1 presented lower richness and diversity, but higher dominance and rarity of species, including some pathobionts. Moreover, its microbiota composition was tightly linked to host blood metabolites related to lipid metabolism and glycolysis at basal time. Despite the lower fiber intake, community type 1 appeared more specialized to produce  as a mean of maintaining the energy supply as glucose concentrations fell during the race. On the other hand, community type 2 showed an enrichment of fibrolytic and cellulolytic bacteria as well as anaerobic fungi, coupled to a higher production of propionate and butyrate. The higher butyrate proportion in community 2 was not associated with protective effects on telomere lengths but could have ameliorated mucosal  and oxidative status. The gut microbiota was neither associated with the blood biochemical markers nor metabolome during the endurance race, and did not provide a biomarker for race ranking or risk of failure to finish the race.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001279>Traumatic Injury and Exposure to Mitochondrial-Derived Damage Associated Molecular Patterns Suppresses Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation.</a></h2><p>Major traumatic injury induces significant remodeling of the circulating neutrophil pool and loss of bactericidal function. Although a well-described phenomenon, research to date has only analyzed blood samples acquired post-hospital admission, and the mechanisms that initiate compromised neutrophil function post-injury are therefore poorly understood. Here, we analyzed pre-hospital blood samples acquired from 62 adult trauma patients (mean age 44 years, range 19-95 years) within 1 h of injury (mean time to sample 39 min, range 13-59 min). We found an immediate impairment in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) generation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) stimulation, which persisted into the acute post-injury phase (4-72 h). Reduced NET generation was accompanied by reduced reactive oxygen species production, impaired activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and a reduction in neutrophil glucose uptake and metabolism to lactate. Pre-treating neutrophils from healthy subjects with mitochondrial-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), whose circulating levels were significantly increased in our trauma patients, reduced NET generation. This mtDAMP-induced impairment in NET formation was associated with an N-formyl peptide mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a negative regulator of aerobic glycolysis and NET formation. Indeed, activation of AMPK via treatment with the AMP-mimetic AICAR significantly reduced neutrophil lactate production in response to PMA stimulation, a phenomenon that we also observed for neutrophils pre-treated with mtDAMPs. Furthermore, the impairment in NET generation induced by mtDAMPs was partially ameliorated by pre-treating neutrophils with the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Taken together, our data demonstrate an immediate trauma-induced impairment in neutrophil anti-microbial function and identify mtDAMP release as a potential initiator of acute post-injury neutrophil dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485198>Development of Novel Topical Cosmeceutical Formulations from  L. with Antimicrobial Activity against Acne-Causing Microorganisms.</a></h2><p>Acne vulgaris occurs due to the  of sebaceous follicles in the skin.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web-like structures of decondensed chromatin, histones, and antimicrobial peptides released by neutrophils. NETs were initially described in the context of pathogen defense but are also involved in autoimmune-mediated skin diseases. Here, we assessed the role of neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) in Schnitzler's syndrome. Immunofluorescence co-staining of myeloperoxidase and subnucleosomal complex was performed on lesional skin samples from patients with Schnitzler's syndrome, other neutrophilic dermatoses (cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, Sweet syndrome, and pyoderma gangrenosum), urticarial vasculitis and chronic spontaneous urticaria as well as healthy control skin. Blood neutrophils from patients with Schnitzler's syndrome and controls were isolated, and NETosis was induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA). Also, NETosis of control neutrophils induced by symptomatic Schnitzler's syndrome sera, cytokines and sub-threshold PMA doses was studied. Immunofluorescence co-staining revealed widespread and substantial NET formation in lesional skin of Schnitzler's syndrome patients but absence of NETs in chronic spontaneous urticaria and control skin. Neutrophils undergoing NETosis were observed in the skin of other neutrophilic diseases too. Correspondingly, blood neutrophils from Schnitzler's syndrome patients showed significantly elevated NETosis rates compared to control neutrophils following stimulation with PMA. Increased NETosis correlated well with high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). SchS patients with the lowest NETosis rates had persistent joint and bone pain despite IL-1 blockade. Stimulation of control neutrophils and sub-threshold PMA with sera of symptomatic Schnitzler's syndrome patients disclosed enhanced NETosis as compared to control sera. Our results suggest that the induction of NET formation by neutrophils contributes to skin and systemic  and may support the resolution of local  in Schnitzler's syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266879>Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids Are Not Predictive of Colonic Tumor Status and Cannot Be Predicted Based on Bacterial Community Structure.</a></h2><p>Colonic bacterial populations are thought to have a role in the development of colorectal cancer with some protecting against  and others exacerbating . Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and are produced in large quantities by colonic bacteria that produce SCFAs by fermenting fiber. We assessed whether there was an association between fecal SCFA concentrations and the presence of colonic adenomas or carcinomas in a cohort of individuals using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic shotgun sequence data. We measured the fecal concentrations of , propionate, and butyrate within the cohort and found that there were no significant associations between SCFA concentration and tumor status. When we incorporated these concentrations into random forest classification models trained to differentiate between people with healthy colons and those with adenomas or carcinomas, we found that they did not significantly improve the ability of 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence-based models to classify individuals. Finally, we generated random forest regression models trained to predict the concentration of each SCFA based on 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence data from the same samples. These models performed poorly and were able to explain at most 14% of the observed variation in the SCFA concentrations. These results support the broader epidemiological data that questions the value of fiber consumption for reducing the risks of colorectal cancer. Although other bacterial metabolites may serve as biomarkers to detect adenomas or carcinomas, fecal SCFA concentrations have limited predictive power. Considering that colorectal cancer is the third leading cancer-related cause of death within the United States, it is important to detect colorectal tumors early and to prevent the formation of tumors. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are often used as a surrogate for measuring gut health and for being anticarcinogenic because of their anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated the fecal SCFA concentrations of a cohort of individuals with different colonic tumor burdens who were previously analyzed to identify microbiome-based biomarkers of tumors. We were unable to find an association between SCFA concentration and tumor burden or use SCFAs to improve our microbiome-based models of classifying people based on their tumor status. Furthermore, we were unable to find an association between the fecal community structure and SCFA concentrations. Our results indicate that the association between fecal SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and tumor burden is weak.Copyright © 2019 Sze et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30721636>Phillygenin exhibits anti-inflammatory activity through modulating multiple cellular behaviors of mouse lymphocytes.</a></h2><p> Phillygenin (PHI) is an intestinal metabolite of phillyrin from the genus .

Mice spleen lymphocytes were incubated with PHI for 4 h, and then stimulated with concanavalin A (Con A) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-/ionomycin (PMA + Ion). Cell viability was assayed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). The expression of CD69 and CD25, proliferation, cell cycle, intracellular Ca concentration, apoptosis, mitochondrial inner membrane potential (), mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of cyclin B1, cyclin D1, Cyclin E, and the phosphorylation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) and p38 were assayed by western blotting.  The results showed that PHI inhibited the proliferation of Con A-activated lymphocytes and induced a G/G phase arrest by suppressing cyclin D1 and cyclin E. Meanwhile, PHI antagonized Con A-induced T cells activation through blocking intracellular Ca overload and suppressing the phosphorylation of JNK and Erk1/2. Both Con A and PMA + Ion-induced secretion of IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α were attenuated by PHI. PHI enhanced Con A-induced lymphocytes apoptosis through decreasing  and increasing MPT.

Reproducibility of nasal secretion cytokine responses and physiological measurements are needed to determine the optimum measurements and power calculations for future studies. We have investigated the reproducibility of nasal cytokine measurements, using ready-to-use polyvinyl  sponges to collect nasal secretions, and measurements of nasal physiological responses.Twelve subjects with allergic rhinitis and no history of respiratory disease, and 12 subjects with asthma and allergic rhinitis underwent a nasal allergen challenge. This was repeated at 7-14 days later.There were increases in IL-5, CCL11, and CXCL8 responses post-challenge (all <0.05). There was better reproducibility at later time points when higher cytokine levels were detected for IL-5 ( =0.64 at 8 hours) and CXCL8 ( =0.91 at 8 hours). Acoustic rhinometry provided good to excellent reproducibility ( =0.66-0.89). Rhinomanometry had lower reproducibility with greater variation ( =0.10-0.70), with some subjects unable to perform the measurement. Multiplex immunoassays provided greater sensitivity for CCL11 measurements.

Important cytoprotective mechanisms activated by oxidative inflammatory conditions are mediated by nitrated fatty acids that covalently modify proteins to limit  and oxidant stress. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of chronic treatment with CXA-10 (10-nitro-9(E)-octadec-9-enoic acid) in the uninephrectomized deoxycorticosterone -high-salt mouse model of CKD. After 4 weeks of treatment, CXA-10 [2.5 millligrams per kilogram (mpk), p.o.] significantly attenuated increases in plasma cholesterol, heart weight, and kidney weight observed in the model without impacting systemic arterial blood pressure. CXA-10 also reduced albuminuria, nephrinuria, glomerular hypertrophy, and glomerulosclerosis in the model. Inflammatory MCP-1 and fibrosis (collagen, fibronectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and osteopontin) renal biomarkers were significantly reduced in the CXA-10 (2.5 mpk) group. The anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects, as well as glomerular protection, were not observed in the enalapril-treated group. Also, CXA-10 appears to exhibit hormesis as all protective effects observed in the low-dose group were absent in the high-dose group (12.5 mpk). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that, at the appropriate dose, the nitrated fatty acid CXA-10 exhibits anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects in the kidney and limits renal injury in a model of CKD.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211831>Intestinal  Modulates the Epithelial Response to Butyrate in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Butyrate-producing gut bacteria are reduced in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), supporting the hypothesis that butyrate supplementation may be beneficial in this setting. Nonetheless, earlier studies suggest that the oxidation of butyrate in IBD patients is altered. We propose that  may decrease epithelial butyrate consumption.Non-IBD controls and IBD patients were recruited for the study. Stool samples were used for short-chain fatty acid and bacterial butyryl CoA: CoA-transferase quantification. Colonic biopsies and ex vivo differentiated epithelial organoids (d-EpOCs) treated with butyrate and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were used for analyzing the expression of transporters MCT1 and ABCG2, metabolic enzyme ACADS, and butyrate receptor GPR43, and for butyrate metabolism and consumption assays.We observed that lower stool content of butyrate-producing bacteria in active IBD patients did not correlate with decreased butyrate concentrations. Indeed, the intestinal epithelial expression of MCT1, ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 was altered in active IBD patients. Nonetheless, d-EpOCs derived from IBD patients showed SLC16A1 (gene encoding for MCT1 protein), ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 expression levels comparable to controls. Moreover, IBD- and non-IBD-derived d-EpOCs responded similarly to butyrate, as assessed by transcriptional regulation. TNFα significantly altered SLC16A1, ABCG2, and GPR43 transcription in d-EpOCs, mimicking the expression profile observed in biopsies from active IBD patients and resulting in reduced butyrate consumption.We provide evidence that the response to butyrate is not intrinsically altered in IBD patients. However, TNFα renders the epithelium less responsive to this metabolite, defeating the purpose of butyrate supplementation during active .© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Estrogens influence neural function through effects on neurons and affects indirectly the oxidative stress, , the cerebral vascular and the immune system.To evaluate the effect of the traditional hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the cognitive function in postmenopausal women.In this randomized clinical trial, 140 postmenopausal women, from November 2014 to February 2015, were included. Women were randomly divided into two groups. Each woman in the case group took traditional HRT (0.625mg conjugated equine estrogens+2.5mg medroxyprogesterone  daily) plus one Cal+D tablet (500 mg calcium+200 IU vitamin D) daily for four months. Women in the control group received only one Cal+D tablet (500 mg calcium+200 IU vitamin D) daily for four months period. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Green Climacteric Scale (GCS) questionnaires filled out after the intervention and compared between the two groups.The mean points of the MoCA after the intervention indicate that all MoCA domains except for the orientation improved in the case group. There was a significant difference in the memory domain after the treatment between the two groups. MoCA domains and GCS were negatively correlated after the intervention (  ).The HRT has affected some of the MoCA factors. The effects of HRT on cognitive function should be studied in a large prospective study in a group of women in their early and late menopausal ages with periodic assessment of their cognitive function during these follow-up years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257455>Pistacia weinmannifolia ameliorates cigarette smoke and lipopolysaccharide‑induced pulmonary  by inhibiting interleukin‑8 production and NF‑κB activation.</a></h2><p>Pistacia weinmannifolia (PW) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat headaches, dysentery, enteritis and influenza. However, PW has not been known for treating respiratory inflammatory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The present in vitro analysis confirmed that PW root extract (PWRE) exerts anti‑inflammatory effects in phorbol myristate ‑ or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‑α)‑stimulated human lung epithelial NCI‑H292 cells by attenuating the expression of interleukin (IL)‑8, IL‑6 and Mucin A5 (MUC5AC), which are closely associated with the pulmonary inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of COPD. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective effect of PWRE on pulmonary  induced by cigarette smoke (CS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Treatment with PWRE significantly reduced the quantity of neutrophils and the levels of inflammatory molecules and toxic molecules, including tumor TNF‑α, IL‑6, IL‑8, monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1, neutrophil elastase and reactive oxygen species, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice with CS‑ and LPS‑induced pulmonary . PWRE also attenuated the influx of inflammatory cells in the lung tissues. Furthermore, PWRE downregulated the activation of nuclear factor‑κB and the expression of phosphodiesterase 4 in the lung tissues. Therefore, these findings suggest that PWRE may be a valuable adjuvant treatment for COPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779919>TRPC6 modulates adhesion of neutrophils to airway epithelial cells via NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression with ozone exposure.</a></h2><p>Ozone (O) is a major component of air pollution, which has been associated with airway  characterized by the influx of neutrophils in asthmatic subjects. Canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) channel is recently identified as a target of oxidative stress which is involved in airway . However, the regulatory role of TRPC6 in airway epithelial cells and neutrophils has not yet been illuminated in detail. In this study, we investigated the role of TRPC6 in neutrophil adhesion to airway epithelial cells exposed to O in vivo and in vitro approaches. Using transgenic mice, the results showed that TRPC6-deficiency attenuated O-induced neutrophil recruitment to airway epithelial cells and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression. In vitro, O induced ICAM-1 expression and neutrophil adhesion to 16HBE cells (human airway epithelial cell line) and which were reduced by both TRPC6 silencing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and TRPC6 inhibitor Larixyl  (LA). We also confirmed that TRPC6-dependent Ca entry and NF-κB activation in 16HBE cells were required for ICAM-1-mediated neutrophil adhesion exposed to O. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the contribution of TRPC6 to O-induced neutrophil adhesion to airway epithelial cells via NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression, which may provide new potential concepts for preventing and treating air pollutant-related inflammatory lung diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we investigated the role of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a sensor of , in angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced renal injury. Subcutaneous infusion of ANG II (600 ng·min·kg) for 28 days was used to induce hypertension and renal injury in mice. The results showed that ANG II-induced hypertensive mice have decreased renal Trpa1 expression ( < 0.01), whereas ANG II receptor type 1a-deficient hypotensive mice have increased renal Trpa1 expression ( < 0.05) compared with their normotensive counterparts. ANG II induced similar elevations of systolic blood pressure in  and wild-type (WT) mice but led to higher levels of blood urea nitrogen ( < 0.05), serum creatinine ( < 0.05), and renal fibrosis ( < 0.01) in  mice than WT mice. Similarly, ANG II increased both CD68/inducible nitric oxide synthase M1 and CD68/arginase 1 M2 macrophages in the kidneys of both  and WT mice (all  < 0.01), with higher extents in  mice (both  < 0.01). Compared with WT mice,  mice had significantly increased expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and their receptors in the kidney. Cultured murine macrophages were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-, which downregulated gene expression of TRPA1 ( < 0.01). A TRPA1 agonist, cinnamaldehyde, significantly inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13--stimulated expression of IL-1β and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 in macrophages, which were attenuated by pretreatment with a TRPA1 antagonist, HC030031. Furthermore, activation of TRPA1 with cinnamaldehyde induced apoptosis of macrophages. These findings suggest that TRPA1 may play a protective role in ANG II-induced renal injury, likely through inhibiting macrophage-mediated .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632402>Effect of Adhesion and Substrate Elasticity on Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cells. Upon stimulation, they are able to decondense and release their chromatin as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This process (NETosis) is part of immune defense mechanisms but also plays an important role in many chronic and inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and cancer. For this reason, much effort has been invested into understanding biochemical signaling pathways in NETosis. However, the impact of the mechanical micro-environment and adhesion on NETosis is not well-understood. Here, we studied how adhesion and especially substrate elasticity affect NETosis. We employed polyacrylamide (PAA) gels with distinctly defined elasticities (Young's modulus  within the physiologically relevant range from 1 to 128 kPa and coated the gels with integrin ligands (collagen I, fibrinogen). Neutrophils were cultured on these substrates and stimulated with potent inducers of NETosis: phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Interestingly, PMA-induced NETosis was neither affected by substrate elasticity nor by different integrin ligands. In contrast, for LPS stimulation, NETosis rates increased with increasing substrate elasticity ( > 20 kPa). LPS-induced NETosis increased with increasing cell contact area, while PMA-induced NETosis did not require adhesion at all. Furthermore, inhibition of phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), which is involved in adhesion signaling, completely abolished LPS-induced NETosis but only slightly decreased PMA-induced NETosis. In summary, we show that LPS-induced NETosis depends on adhesion and substrate elasticity while PMA-induced NETosis is completely independent of adhesion.Copyright © 2019 Erpenbeck, Gruhn, Kudryasheva, Günay, Meyer, Busse, Neubert, Schön, Rehfeldt and Kruss.</p></html>
