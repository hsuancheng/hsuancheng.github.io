This study aimed to find the mechanism of peptide from Alaska Pollock (APP) on intestinal mucosal  in mice induced by cyclophosphamide (Cy). Cy-induced decreases of body weight and index of immune organ were significantly improved by APP as compared with Cy group ( < 0.05). APP could promote the secretion of SIgA and IgA on intestinal mucosa ( < 0.05) and mainly had an impact on the final differentiation of IgA B cell, thereby promoting the secretion of plasma cells, which can be corroborated by the increases of IL-6 and IL-10 ( < 0.05). APP with high immune activity was separated and two peptides were purified and identified as -Val-Ile- and Ala--Asn--. Therefore, APP can be considered as beneficial ingredients to protect the intestinal barrier disruption induced by Cy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29336142>Smart Dual Quenching Strategy Enhances the Detection Sensitivity of Intracellular Furin.</a></h1><p>Development of sensitive fluorescence "Turn-On" strategies for imaging enzyme activity in living cells is of disease-diagnostic importance but remains challenging. Herein, by employing a click condensation reaction and rational design of a single quenched probe (StBu)-(-(DABCYL)-----Val---FITC)-CBT (1), we developed a "smart" dual quenching strategy and applied it to detect intracellular furin activity with enhanced sensitivity. At physiological conditions, 1 was subjected to reduction-controlled condensation reaction to form 1-NPs and its fluorescence intensity further dropped to 1/2.8 of its original. Upon furin cleavage in vitro, the dual quenched 1-NPs had fluorescence "Turn-On" contrast 11-fold more than that of single quenched control probe FITC---Val-----(DABCYL)--OH (1-P). Live cell imaging results indicated that 1 showed fluorescence "Turn-On" contrast 6.3-fold of that of 1-P for sensing intracellular furin activity. We envision that, by replacing the RVRR substrate with other enzyme-cleavable ones, our versatile "smart" dual quenching strategy could be easily adjusted for the detection (or imaging) of other intracellular enzymes' activity with enhanced sensitivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2444471>Localization of a receptor binding site on the IL-2 molecule.</a></h1><p>The present study was performed to localize in the IL-2 molecule the active site responsible for interaction with the IL-2 receptor. To predict the receptor binding site on the IL-2 molecule, a computer programme based on the hypothesis that the active site will contain parts of the protein molecule having a high tendency to form a bend was utilized. The tendency to form a bend was evaluated by assessing the probability of beta-turn occurrence; the highest probability was found in the tetrapeptide Asn-Pro--Leu, occupying the positions 33-36 of the IL-2 molecule. Accordingly, the hexadecapeptide H--Nle--Ile-Asn-Asn-Tyr--Asn-Pro--Leu-Thr--Met-Leu-NH2 that spans over the predicted tetrapeptide Asn-Pro--Leu and comprises the region 27-40 from the IL-2 amino acid sequence was synthesized. This synthetic (I-16) peptide was found to selectively inhibit the IL-2-dependent uptake of 3H-TDR by CTLL cells, apparently by competing with IL-2 for the IL-2 receptor. The synthetic I-16 hexadecapeptide was conjugated to carrier (BSA) protein and used for immunization of rabbits. Resulting I-16 antibodies were capable of binding specifically to the I-16 hexadecapeptide in indirect ELISA test; they reacted substantially with IL-2-producing but not with IL-2-non-producing Jurkat cells in indirect cell membrane immunofluorescence, and inhibited activation of killer spleen cells with human recombinant IL-2 as detected by 51Cr microcytotoxicity assay. Taken together, these results suggest that at least one of the receptor contact sites of the IL-2 is localized within the N-terminal part of the molecule in the region defined by amino acids 27-40 and coded for by the exon 1 and 2.</p></html>
