However, these approaches are limited or carry various complications. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of unique therapeutic approaches.To investigate the anti-angiogenic effects of curcumolide and its mechanism of action.In this study, we examine the effects of curcumolide on the process of vasculature formation, including cell proliferation, migration, tube formation and apoptosis in vitro using human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). We also assess the anti-angiogenic effects of curcumolide in vivo using a mouse model of  induced retinopathy (OIR). The mechanism of anti-angiogenic effects was investigated by measuring the expression level of various signaling proteins and the molecular docking simulations.Intravitreal injection of curcumolide reduced the formation of retinal neovascular tufts and VEGFR2 phosphorylation in the murine OIR model at concentrations administered without definite cellular and retinal toxicities. Curcumolide suppressed VEGF-induced HRMECs proliferation, migration and tube formation in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, it promoted caspase-dependent apoptosis. Curcumolide also inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2  kinase, and suppressed downstream protein kinases of VEGFR2, including Src, FAK, ERK, AKT, and mTOR in HRMECs. In silico study revealed that curcumolide bound with ATP-binding sites of the VEGFR2 kinase unit by the formation of a hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions.Curcumolide has anti-angiogenic activity in HUVECs and in a murine OIR model of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization, and it might be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Penfluridol, a long-acting oral antipsychotic drug, has an outstanding safety record and exerts oncostatic effects on various solid tumors. Until now, the effect of penfluridol on AML remains unknown.AML cell lines harboring wild-type (WT) Fms-like  kinase 3 (FLT3) and internal tandem duplication (ITD)-mutated FLT3 were used to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of penfluridol by an MTS assay. A flow cytometric analysis and immunofluorescence staining were employed to determine the cell-death phenotype, cell cycle profile, and reactive  species (ROS) and acidic vesicular organelle (AVO) formation. Western blotting and chemical inhibitors were used to explore the underlying mechanisms involved in penfluridol-mediated cell death.We observed that penfluridol concentration-dependently suppressed the cell viability of AML cells with FLT3-WT (HL-60 and U937) and FLT3-ITD (MV4-11). We found that penfluridol treatment not only induced apoptosis as evidenced by increases of nuclear fragmentation, the sub-G populations, poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and caspase-3 activation, but also triggered autophagic responses, such as the light chain 3 (LC3) turnover and AVO formation. Interestingly, blocking autophagy by the pharmacological inhibitors, 3-methyladenine and chloroquine, dramatically enhanced penfluridol-induced apoptosis, indicating the cytoprotective role of autophagy in penfluridol-treated AML cells. Mechanistically, penfluridol-induced apoptosis occurred through activating protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to suppress Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities. Moreover, penfluridol's augmentation of intracellular ROS levels was critical for the penfluridol-induced autophagic response. In the clinic, we observed that patients with AML expressing high PP2A had favorable prognoses.These findings provide a rationale for penfluridol being used as a PP2A activator for AML treatment, and the combination of penfluridol with an autophagy inhibitor may be a novel strategy for AML harboring FLT3-WT and FLT3-ITD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30990365>Mitigation of cocaine-mediated mitochondrial damage, defective mitophagy and microglial activation by superoxide dismutase mimetics.</a></h1><p>Although cocaine exposure has been shown to potentiate neuroinflammation by upregulating glial activation in the brain, the role of mitophagy in this process remains an enigma. In the present study, we sought to examine the role of impaired mitophagy in cocaine-mediated activation of microglia and to determine the ameliorative potential of superoxide dismutase mimetics in this context. Our findings demonstrated that exposure of mouse primary microglial cells (mPMs) to cocaine resulted in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, that was accompanied by increased expression of mitophagy markers, PINK1 and PRKN. Exposure of microglia to cocaine also resulted in increased expression of DNM1L and OPTN with a concomitant decrease in the rate of mitochondrial  consumption as well as impaired mitochondrial functioning. Additionally, in the presence of cocaine, microglia also exhibited upregulated expression of autophagosome markers, BECN1, MAP1LC3B-II, and SQSTM1. Taken together, these findings suggested diminished mitophagy flux and accumulation of mitophagosomes in the presence of cocaine. These findings were further confirmed by imaging techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. Cocaine-mediated activation of microglia was further monitored by assessing the expression of the microglial marker (ITGAM) and the inflammatory cytokine (Tnf, Il1b, and Il6) mRNAs. Pharmacological, as well as gene-silencing approaches aimed at blocking both the autophagy/mitophagy and SIGMAR1 expression, underscored the role of impaired mitophagy in cocaine-mediated activation of microglia. Furthermore, superoxide dismutase mimetics such as TEMPOL and MitoTEMPO were shown to alleviate cocaine-mediated impaired mitophagy as well as microglial activation.

Unfortunately, hepatotoxicity is a serious limitation in its clinical application, and the reason remains largely unknown. In this study, we tested the effect of crizotinib in human hepatocyte cell line HL-7702 and human primary hepatocytes, and the results showed that crizotinib treatment caused hepatocyte damage, suggesting that crizotinib induced liver injury by causing hepatocyte death, consistent with the clinical cases. Mechanistically, crizotinib induced hepatocyte death via the apoptotic pathway, and cleaved PARP (c-PARP) was observed as a signaling protein. Moreover, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) decrease contributed to crizotinib-induced hepatocyte apoptosis accompanied by hepatocyte DNA damage and reactive  species (ROS) generation. Importantly, crizotinib induced hepatocyte apoptosis independent of its targets, ALK, ROS1 and MET. In conclusion, our data showed that crizotinib induced liver injury through hepatocyte death via the apoptotic pathway which was independent of ALK, ROS1 and MET. And we also found that MMP decrease, DNA damage and ROS generation were involved in the process.Copyright © 2019.

Lots of studies focus on the detection of intracellular ROS by small fluorescent molecules. However, ROS recognized by biocompatible nanoparticles are relatively less reported. It is widely known that albumin-based nanomaterials possess unique advantages in biomedical applications because they are biodegradable and biocompatible. Herein, fluorescent protein nanoparticles (PNPs) were prepared using BSA as a starting material without introducing extra fluorescent molecules. The blue fluorescent PNPs were well characterized by FL, FTIR, CD, TEM, DLS, etc. It was revealed that the PNPs exhibited two types of emissive centers through FL spectra and the fluorescence lifetimes. Further mechanism study indicated that the fluorescence of the PNPs was mainly derived from three kinds of aromatic amino acids, namely tryptophan,  and phenylalanine. Moreover, the fluorescence properties of the PNPs were tightly related to pH. The PNPs displayed excellent stabilities under harsh conditions as well as physiological conditions. In addition, the PNPs (200 μg/mL) were nontoxic to HeLa and GES-1 cell lines, showing good biocompatibility. The cellular uptake of PNPs was occurred only when the cells were stressed with glucose oxidase or HO, thereafter the bright blue fluorescence was observed, indicating that it could be utilized for the recognition of cellular oxidation damage. These findings will offer novel clues for the future synthesis of even brighter protein nanoparticles and their biomedical applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, diagnosing the disease during the pre-symptomatic period remains an unmet goal. To that end, we used pharmacological MRI (phMRI) to assess the function of the cortico-basal ganglia circuit in a non-human primate model of dopamine deficiency to determine the possible relationships between phMRI signals with behavioral, neurochemical, and histological measurements. Animals with unilateral treatments with the neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), that expressed stable, long-term hemiparkinsonism were challenged with the dopaminergic receptor agonist, apomorphine, and structure-specific phMRI blood  level-dependent (BOLD) activation responses were measured. Behavioral, histopathological, and neurochemical measurements were obtained and correlated with phMRI activation of structures of the cortico-basal ganglia system. Greater phMRI activations in the basal ganglia and cortex were associated with slower movement speed, decreased daytime activity, or more pronounced parkinsonian features. Animals showed decreased stimulus-evoked dopamine release in the putamen and substantia nigra pars compacta and lower basal glutamate levels in the motor cortex on the MPTP-lesioned hemisphere compared to the contralateral hemisphere. The altered neurochemistry was significantly correlated with phMRI signals in the motor cortex and putamen. Finally, greater phMRI activations in the caudate nucleus correlated with fewer  hydroxylase-positive (TH) nigral cells and decreased TH fiber density in the putamen. These results reveal the correlation of phMRI signals with the severity of the motor deficits and pathophysiological changes in the cortico-basal ganglia circuit.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Mismatch between these genomes is believed to be strongly selected against due to the consequent impairments of mitochondrial functions and induction of oxidative stress. Here, we used a  model harboring an incompatibility between a mitochondrial tRNA and its nuclear-encoded mitochondrial  synthetase to assess the cellular mechanisms affected by this incompatibility and to test the relative contribution of mitonuclear interactions and aging on the expression of impaired phenotypes. Our results show that the mitochondrial tRNA mutation caused a decrease in mitochondrial  consumption in the incompatible nuclear background but no effect with the compatible nuclear background. Mitochondrial DNA copy number increased in the incompatible genotype but that increase failed to rescue mitochondrial functions. The flies harboring mismatch between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes had almost three times the relative mtDNA copy number and fifty percent higher rate of hydrogen peroxide production compared to other genome combinations at 25 days of age. We also found that aging exacerbated the mitochondrial dysfunctions. Our results reveal the tight interactions linking mitonuclear mismatch to mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial DNA regulation, ROS production and aging.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31043480> aminotransferase is involved in the oxidative stress response by metabolizing  in .</a></h1><p>Under oxidative stress conditions, hydroxyl radicals can oxidize the phenyl ring of phenylalanine, producing the abnormal  isomer  (-).  levels are commonly used as a biomarker of oxidative stress, and its accumulation has recently been reported to adversely affect cells, suggesting a direct role for  in oxidative stress effects. We found that the  ortholog of  aminotransferase (TATN-1)-the first enzyme involved in the metabolic degradation of -is up-regulated in response to oxidative stress and directly activated by the oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor SKN-1. Worms deficient in  aminotransferase activity displayed increased sensitivity to multiple sources of oxidative stress.

In response to increasing levels of nitric oxide, S-nitrosylation of cysteine thiol groups leads to post-transcriptional modification of many cellular proteins and thereby regulates their activity and allows cellular adaptation to increased levels of ONS. S-nitrosylation inhibits the function of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, toll-like receptor-mediated signalling and the activity of several mitogen-activated protein kinases, while activating nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2 or NFE2L2); in turn, the redox-regulated activation of Nrf2 leads to increased levels and/or activity of key enzymes and transporter systems involved in the glutathione system. The Nrf2/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 axis is associated with upregulation of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, which in turn has anti-inflammatory effects. Increased Nrf2 transcriptional activity also leads to activation of haem oxygenase-1, which is associated with upregulation of bilirubin, biliverdin and biliverdin reductase as well as increased carbon monoxide signalling, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. Associated transcriptional responses, which may be mediated by retrograde signalling owing to elevated hydrogen peroxide, include the unfolded protein response (UPR), mitohormesis and the mitochondrial UPR; the UPR also results from increasing levels of mitochondrial and cytosolic reactive  species and reactive nitrogen species leading to nitrosylation, glutathionylation, oxidation and nitration of crucial cysteine and  causing protein misfolding and the development of endoplasmic reticulum stress. It is shown how these mechanisms co-operate in forming a co-ordinated rapid and prolonged compensatory antioxidant response system.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of pre-treatments from ORI against MPP- or kainic acid (KA)-induced damage in nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cells were investigated. Results showed that pre-treatments of ORI at 0.25-2 μM enhanced the viability and plasma membrane integrity of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. MPP or KA exposure down-regulated Bcl-2 mRNA expression, up-regulated Bax mRNA expression, increased caspase-3 activity and decreased Na-K ATPase activity. ORI pre-treatments at test concentrations reversed these changes. ORI pre-treatments decreased reactive  species production, raised glutathione level, and increased glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and catalase activities in MPP or KA treated cells. ORI pre-treatments lowered tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and prostaglandin E levels in MPP or KA treated cells. ORI also diminished MPP or KA induced increase in nuclear factor-κB binding activity. MPP exposure suppressed  hydroxylase (TH) mRNA expression and decreased dopamine content. KA exposure reduced glutamine synthetase (GS) mRNA expression, raised glutamate level and lowered glutamine level. ORI pre-treatments at 0.5-2 μM up-regulated mRNA expression of TH and GS, restored DA and glutamine content. These findings suggested that oridonin was a potent neuro-protective agent against Parkinson's disease and seizure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The N/N ratio analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that N derived from NO (NO-N) comprised < 5% of the total plant N, showing that the contribution of NO-N as N source was minor. Moreover, histological analysis showed that leaf size and biomass were increased upon NO treatment, and that these increases were attributable to leaf age-dependent enhancement of cell proliferation and enlargement. Thus, NO may act as a plant growth signal rather than an N source. Exposure of Arabidopsis leaves to 40 ppm NO induced virtually exclusive nitration of PsbO and PsbP proteins (a high concentration of NO was used). The PMF analysis identified the ninth  residue of PsbO1 (Tyr) as a nitration site. Tyr of PsbO1 was exclusively nitrated after incubation of the thylakoid membranes with a buffer containing NO and NO or a buffer containing NO alone. Nitration was catalyzed by illumination and repressed by photosystem II (PSII) electron transport inhibitors, and decreased  evolution. Thus, protein  nitration altered (downregulated) the physiological function of cellular proteins of Arabidopsis leaves. This indicates that NO-induced protein  nitration may stimulate plant growth. We hypothesized that atmospheric NO at ambient concentrations may induce  nitration of PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors in Arabidopsis leaves, followed by degradation of PYR/PYL/RCAR, upregulation of target of rapamycin (TOR) regulatory complexes, and stimulation of plant growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489034>Karonudib is a promising anticancer therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer and is generally caused by viral infections or consumption of mutagens, such as alcohol. While liver transplantation and hepatectomy is curative for some patients, many relapse into disease with few treatment options such as  kinase inhibitors, for example, sorafenib or lenvatinib. The need for novel systemic treatment approaches is urgent.MTH1 expression profile was first analyzed in a HCC database and MTH1 mRNA/protein level was determined in resected HCC and paired paracancerous tissues with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry. HCC cancer cell lines were exposed  to MTH1 inhibitors or depleted of MTH1 by siRNA. 8-oxoG was measured by the modified comet assay. The effect of MTH1 inhibition on tumor growth was explored in HCC xenograft  models.MTH1 protein level is elevated in HCC tissue compared with paracancerous liver tissue and indicates poor prognosis. The MTH1 inhibitor Karonudib (TH1579) and siRNA effectively introduce toxic oxidized nucleotides into DNA, 8-oxoG, and kill HCC cell lines . Furthermore, we demonstrate that HCC growth in a xenograft mouse model  is efficiently suppressed by Karonudib.Altogether, these data suggest HCC relies on MTH1 for survival, which can be targeted and may open up a novel treatment option for HCC in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412566>The Immune Landscape of Thyroid Cancer in the Context of Immune Checkpoint Inhibition.</a></h1><p>Immune cells play critical roles in tumor prevention as well as initiation and progression. However, immune-resistant cancer cells can evade the immune system and proceed to form tumors. The normal microenvironment (immune cells, fibroblasts, blood and lymphatic vessels, and interstitial extracellular matrix (ECM)) maintains tissue homeostasis and prevents tumor initiation. Inflammatory mediators, reactive  species, cytokines, and chemokines from an altered microenvironment promote tumor growth. During the last decade, thyroid cancer, the most frequent cancer of the endocrine system, has emerged as the fifth most incident cancer in the United States (USA), and its incidence is steadily growing. Inflammation has long been associated with thyroid cancer, raising critical questions about the role of immune cells in its pathogenesis. A plethora of immune cells and their mediators are present in the thyroid cancer ecosystem. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting immune checkpoints, such as mAbs anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death protein-1/programmed cell death ligand-1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1), have revolutionized the treatment of many malignancies, but they induce thyroid dysfunction in up to 10% of patients, presumably by enhancing autoimmunity. Combination strategies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with  kinase (TK) or serine/threonine protein kinase B-raf (BRAF) inhibitors are showing considerable promise in the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer. This review illustrates how different immune cells contribute to thyroid cancer development and the rationale for the antitumor effects of ICIs in combination with BRAF/TK inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557947>Overexpression of  Systemic Defense Trigger 1 (MoSDT1) Confers Improved Rice Blast Resistance in Rice.</a></h1><p>The effector proteins secreted by a pathogen not only promote virulence and infection of the pathogen, but also trigger plant defense response. Therefore, these proteins could be used as important genetic resources for transgenic improvement of plant disease resistance.  systemic defense trigger 1 (MoSDT1) is an effector protein. In this study, we compared the agronomic traits and blast disease resistance between wild type (WT) and MoSDT1 overexpressing lines in rice. Under control conditions, MoSDT1 transgenic lines increased the number of tillers without affecting kernel morphology. In addition, MoSDT1 transgenic lines conferred improved blast resistance, with significant effects on the activation of callose deposition, reactive  species (ROS) accumulation and cell death. On the one hand, overexpression of MoSDT1 could delay biotrophy-necrotrophy switch through regulating the expression of  () and ), and activate plant defense response by regulating the expression of , , ,  (),  (),  (),  (),  () in rice. On the other hand, overexpression of MoSDT1 could increase the accumulation of some defense-related primary metabolites such as two aromatic amino acids ( and L-tryptohan), 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid, which could be converted to ethylene, vanillic acid and L-saccharopine. Taken together, overexpression of MoSDT1 confers improved rice blast resistance in rice, through modulation of callose deposition, ROS accumulation, the expression of defense-related genes, and the accumulation of some primary metabolites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818884>Anti-Wrinkling and Anti-Melanogenic Effect of  Methanol Extract.</a></h1><p>Ultraviolet (UV) exposure causes skin photoaging leading to skin wrinkling and sagging via production of reactive  species (ROS). For this reason, protection from photoaging is an important feature in cosmeceutical and dermatological products. Natural product-derived biomaterials are highly desired as future possible ingredients, because these biomaterials are often safe and effective. In this study, we aimed to characterize the skin protective activity of , traditionally used to treat sunburn and erythema. We determined the free radical scavenging, anti-melanogenic, and moisturizing effects of a methanol extract of  (Pm-ME) in keratinocytes (HaCaT cells), melanocytes (B16F10 cells), and fibroblasts (human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs)) at non-cytotoxic concentrations.  methanol extract contains coumaric acid as a major component, and the extract exhibited protective activity against UVB- and H₂O₂-induced cytotoxicity. This extract also suppressed the expression of  (s) and  in HaCaT cells. A reduction of  expression under UVB- and H₂O₂-treated conditions was recovered in HaCaT cells by Pm-ME. This extract displayed significant free radical scavenging activity according to the 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) assay. The Pm-ME also upregulated the expression levels of  () and  () in HaCaT cells, indicating a putative moisturizing activity. Interestingly, the expression of collagen type 1 () gene and its promoter activity, as assessed by a reporter gene assay, were found to be increased in HDF and HEK293 cells. Similarly, Pm-ME helped recover collagen levels after UVB and H₂O₂ treatment in HDFs as well as decreased the synthesis and secretion of melanin from B16F10 melanoma cells, which may indicate a beneficial whitening cosmetic value. The p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 suppressed  and  expression in H₂O₂-treated HaCaT cells. Similarly, the ERK inhibitor U0126 inhibited  in Pm-ME/H₂O₂-treated HaCaT cells. These findings suggested that inhibition of JNK and p38 and activation of ERK could be targeted by Pm-ME. Therefore, Pm-ME may exert anti-photoaging and anti-melanogenic properties via the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, which could be beneficial in the cosmeceutical industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464432>Role of Amino Acid Residues for Dioxygen Activation in the Second Coordination Sphere of the Dicopper Site of pMMO.</a></h1><p>Formation of an active  species at the dicopper site of pMMO is studied by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The role of the amino acid residues of  (Tyr374) and glutamate (Glu35) located in the second coordination sphere of the dicopper site is discussed in detail. The phenolic proton of the  residue is transferred to the CuO core in a two-step manner via the glutamate residue, and an electron is directly transferred to the CuO core. These proton- and electron-transfer processes induce the O-O bond cleavage of the μ-η:η-peroxodicopper(II) species to form the (μ-oxo)(μ-hydroxo)CuCu species, which is able to play a key role of methane hydroxylation at the dicopper site of pMMO (  2013 , 52 , 7907 ). This proton-coupled electron-transfer mechanism is a little different from that in tyrosinase in that the proton of substrate  is directly transferred to the dicopper site (  2006 , 128 , 9873 ) because there is no proton acceptor in the vicinity of the dicopper site of tyrosinase. The rate-determining step for the formation of the (μ-oxo)(μ-hydroxo)CuCu species is determined to be the O-O bond cleavage. These results shed new light on the interpretation of the role of the  and glutamate residues located in the second coordination sphere of the dicopper site of pMMO.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244234>Recognition, Intervention, and Monitoring of Neutrophils in Acute Ischemic Stroke.</a></h1><p>Neutrophils are implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases, and especially in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The unchecked migration of neutrophils into cerebral ischemic regions, and their subsequent release of reactive  species, are considered the primary causes of reperfusion injury following AIS. Reducing the infiltration of inflammatory neutrophils may therefore be a useful therapy for AIS. Here, inspired by the specific cell-cell recognition that occurs between platelets and inflammatory neutrophils, we describe platelet-mimetic nanoparticles (PTNPs) that can be used to directly recognize, intervene, and monitor inflammatory neutrophils in the AIS treatment and therapeutic evaluation. We demonstrate that PTNPs, coloaded with piceatannol, a selective spleen  kinase inhibitor, and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), a T2 contrast agent, can successfully recognize adherent neutrophils via platelet membrane coating. The loaded piceatannol could then be delivered to adherent neutrophils and detach them into circulation, thus decreasing neutrophil infiltration and reducing infarct size. Moreover, when coupled with magnetic resonance imaging, internalized SPIO could be used to monitor the inflammatory neutrophils, associated with therapeutic effects, in real time. This approach is an innovative method for both the treatment and therapeutic evaluation of AIS, and provides new insights into how to treat and monitor neutrophil-associated diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108247>Management Strategies for Early-Onset Pulmonary Events Associated with Brigatinib.</a></h1><p>Rare cases of early-onset pulmonary events (EOPEs) occurring within days of the start of administration of brigatinib have been reported (incidence 3%-6% with use of the recommended dose of 90 mg for 7 days and then a 180-mg step-up dosing regimen). Current prescribing information suggests dose interruption and then dose reduction for grade 1 or 2 events and discontinuation for recurrent or higher grade events. However, clinical experience suggests that alternative strategies exist to safely maintain dosing.Case vignettes illustrating different EOPE clinical scenarios were assembled; they included (1) successful treatment through the initial EOPE, (2) successful rechallenge after the EOPE, (3) successful rechallenge after the EOPE with utilization of a shallower step-up regimen, and (4) unsuccessful rechallenge.Rapid tolerization to EOPEs within 5 to 8 days may occur with continued dosing, suggesting that dose interruption could be avoided with close observation and temporary supportive care (including supplemental ). If dose interruption occurs, restarting administration of brigatinib at 30 mg, followed by dose increases in 30-mg increments every 3 days to the full dose as tolerated ("shallow step-up dosing") may maximize safety during rechallenge. As compromised baseline respiratory function may increase the rate of clinically apparent EOPEs, proactive use of shallow step-up dosing could be considered in select cases.Clinically apparent EOPEs are a rare complication of brigatinib. They occur within days of starting administration of the drug, with rapid tolerization possible during continued dosing. Adapting the EOPE nomenclature to include the word transient (TEOPE) may further clinician and patient understanding in distinguishing these events from the pneumonitis seen with other  kinase inhibitors. Improved education and appropriate supportive care and dosing should allow more patients to maximally and safely benefit from brigatinib.Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

In this study, a series of STAT3 inhibitors were developed by connecting N, N-diethyl-7-aminocoumarin fluorophore with benzo [b]thiophene 1, 1-dioxide moiety. All designed compounds displayed potent anti-proliferative activity against cancer cells. The representative compound 7a was mainly accumulated in mitochondria visualized by its fluorescence. STAT3 phosphorylation was inhibited by compound 7a at both Tyr705 and Ser727 residues. Compound 7a inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation whereas had no influence on the phosphorylation levels of STAT1, JAK2, Src and Erk1/2, indicating good selectivity of compound 7a. Moreover, compound 7a down-regulated the expression of STAT3 target genes Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1, increased ROS production and remarkably reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential to induce mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, compound 7ain vivo suppressed breast cancer 4T1 implanted tumor growth. Taken together, these results highlighted that compound 7a might be a promising mitochondria-targeting STAT3 inhibitor for cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Meat was either stored in the dark, under light, or in the dark with addition of FeCl/HO/myoglobin (forced oxidation). SDS-PAGE analysis showed high degree of protein polymerization for meat exposed to light, compared to the other samples. Light exposure induced reducible (disulfide) and non-reducible cross-links, while mainly disulfides were formed in meat stored in the dark. Light exposure was responsible for 58% loss of free thiols (Cys residues). No significant loss of other amino acid residues was observed and none of the most common oxidation products of tryptophan, , and phenylalanine were detected. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements of tryptophan showed 27% loss in samples exposed to light, which was ascribed to loss of protein solubility via protein polymerization rather than tryptophan oxidation. Protein carbonyls were mainly detected in forced oxidized samples at Day 0.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Coronary angiogenesis plays a vital role in maintaining cardiac vascularization and perfusion during physiological and pathological hypertrophy. On the other hand, a reduction in cardiac capillary density with subsequent tissue hypoxia, cell death and interstitial fibrosis contributes to the development of contractile dysfunction and heart failure, as suggested by clinical as well as experimental evidence. Although the molecular causes underlying the inadequate (with respect to the increased  and energy demands of the hypertrophied cardiomyocyte) cardiac vascularization developing during pathological hypertrophy are incompletely understood. Research efforts over the past years have discovered interesting mediators and potential candidates involved in this process. In this review article, we will focus on the vascular changes occurring during cardiac hypertrophy and the transition toward heart failure both in human disease and preclinical models. We will summarize recent findings in transgenic mice and experimental models of cardiac hypertrophy on factors expressed and released from cardiomyocytes, pericytes and inflammatory cells involved in the paracrine (dys)regulation of cardiac angiogenesis. Moreover, we will discuss major signaling events of critical angiogenic ligands in endothelial cells and their possible disturbance by hypoxia or oxidative stress. In this regard, we will particularly highlight findings on negative regulators of angiogenesis, including protein  phosphatase-1B and tumor suppressor p53, and how they link signaling involved in cell growth and metabolic control to cardiac angiogenesis. Besides endothelial cell death, phenotypic conversion and acquisition of myofibroblast-like characteristics may also contribute to the development of cardiac fibrosis, the structural correlate of cardiac dysfunction. Factors secreted by (dysfunctional) endothelial cells and their effects on cardiomyocytes including hypertrophy, contractility and fibrosis, close the vicious circle of reciprocal cell-cell interactions within the heart during pathological hypertrophy remodeling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30962283>HO induces nuclear transport of the receptor  kinase c-MET in breast cancer cells via a membrane-bound retrograde trafficking mechanism.</a></h1><p>Reactive  species (ROS) are cellular by-products produced from metabolism and also anticancer agents, such as ionizing irradiation and chemotherapy drugs. The ROS HO has high rates of production in cancer cells because of their rapid proliferation. ROS oxidize DNA, protein, and lipids, causing oxidative stress in cancer cells and making them vulnerable to other stresses. Therefore, cancer cell survival relies on maintaining ROS-induced stress at tolerable levels. Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-MET) is a receptor  kinase overexpressed in malignant cancer types, including breast cancer. Full-length c-MET triggers a signal transduction cascade from the plasma membrane that, through downstream signaling proteins, up-regulates cell proliferation and migration. Recently, c-MET was shown to interact and phosphorylate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 in the nucleus and to induce poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor resistance. However, it remains unclear how c-MET moves from the cell membrane to the nucleus. Here, we demonstrate that HO induces retrograde transport of membrane-associated full-length c-MET into the nucleus of human MCF10A and MCF12A or primary breast cancer cells. We further show that knocking down either coatomer protein complex subunit γ1 (COPG1) or Sec61 translocon β subunit (SEC61β) attenuates the accumulation of full-length nuclear c-MET. However, a c-MET kinase inhibitor did not block nuclear c-MET transport. Moreover, nuclear c-MET interacted with KU proteins in breast cancer cells, suggesting a role of full-length nuclear c-MET in ROS-induced DNA damage repair. We conclude that a membrane-bound retrograde vesicle transport mechanism facilitates membrane-to-nucleus transport of c-MET in breast cancer cells.© 2019 Chen et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30623407>Small molecule of sphingosine as a rescue of dopaminergic cells: A cell therapy approach in neurodegenerative diseases therapeutics.</a></h1><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients should take medication such as fingolimod (FTY-720) for a long time, hence pharmaceutical effects on other neural cells such as dopaminergic cells are important. Dopaminergic cell line, BE(2)-M17, was treated by FTY-720 and then cell viability and genes involve in neurosurvival were investigated. It was disclosed that FTY-720 significantly stimulates Bcl2 overexpression. Whereas, it decreased intracellular reactive  species production and cell membrane damage of dopaminergic cells. The increase in Bcl2/Bax ratio increased the cell metabolic activity and decreased propidium iodide-positive cells. Besides, FTY-720 induced the overexpression of CACNA1C, nNOS gene, and nitric oxide production. However, FTY-720 induced GABARA1 overexpression and eventually it could overcame to the cytotoxic effect of intracellular calcium. This cascade led to  hydroxylase and BDNF genes overexpression whereas FTY-720 did not change GDNF concentration in BE(2)-M17 cells. Concluding, it might be said that taking FTY-720 in MS patients did not induce adverse effect on dopaminergic cells.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115776> nitration of mitochondrial proteins during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.</a></h1><p>Myocardial ischemia reperfusion is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased formation of reactive /nitrogen species. The main purpose of this study was to assess the role of  nitration of mitochondrial proteins in postischemic contractile dysfunction known as myocardial stunning. Isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were subjected to 20-min global ischemia followed by 30-min reperfusion. The reperfused hearts showed marked decline in left ventricular developed pressure, maximal rate of contraction (+dP/dt), and maximal rate of relaxation (-dP/dt). Immunofluorescence and ELISA assays demonstrated enhanced protein  nitration in reperfused hearts. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, eight mitochondrial proteins were identified to be nitrated after ischemia reperfusion. These proteins are crucial in mitochondrial electron transport, fatty acid oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, ATP synthesis, and control of high-energy phosphates. The proteome data also indicated reduced abundance in several of nitrated proteins. The results suggest that these changes may contribute to inhibition of aconitase activity but are unlikely to affect electron transport chain activity. Whether  nitration of mitochondrial proteins can be considered the contributing factor of postischemic contractile dysfunction remains to be explored.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323446>Licochalcone B inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of human non-small-cell lung cancer cells by dual targeting of EGFR and MET.</a></h1><p>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene alterations are associated with sensitization to  kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib in lung cancer. Some patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have difficulty in treating the cancer due to resistance acquired to gefitinib with MET amplification. Therefore EGFR and MET may be attractive targets for lung cancer therapy.This study aimed to investigate the anti-cancer activity of Licochalcone (LC)B extracted from Glycyrrhiza inflata, in gefitinib-sensitive or gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells, and to define its mechanisms.We investigated the mechanism of action of LCB by targeting EGFR and MET in human NSCLC cells.We used the HCC827 and HCC827GR lines as gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant cells respectively, and determined the effects of LCB on both, by performing cell proliferation assay, flow cytometry analysis and Western blotting. Targets of LCB were identified by pull-down/kinase assay and molecular docking simulation.LCB inhibited both EGFR and MET kinase activity by directly binding to their ATP-binding pockets. The ability of this interaction was verified by computational docking and molecular dynamics simulations. LCB suppressed viability and colony formation of both HCC827 and HCC827GR cells while exhibiting no cytotoxicity to normal cells. The induction of G2/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis by LCB was confirmed by Annexin V/7-AAD double staining, ER stress and reactive  species induction, mitochondrial membrane potential loss and caspase activation as well as related-proteins regulation. Inhibition of EGFR and MET by LCB decreased ERBB3 and AKT axis activation.We provide insights into the LCB-mediated mechanisms involved in reducing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in NSCLC cells. This occurs through dual inhibition of EGFR and MET in NSCLC cells regardless of their sensitivity or resistance to gefitinib. LCB may be a promising novel therapeutic medicine for gefitinib-sensitive or resistant NSCLC treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Active ingredients in coffee have therefore received considerable attention from researchers. A wide variety of effects have been attributed to cafestol, one of the major compounds in coffee beans. Because cardiac hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events, this study examined whether cafestol inhibits urotensin II (U-II)-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed only to U-II (1  nM) or to U-II (1  nM) following 12-h pretreatment with cafestol (1-10   M). Cafestol (3-10   M) pretreatment significantly inhibited U-II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy with an accompanying decrease in U-II-induced reactive  species (ROS) production. Cafestol also inhibited U-II-induced phosphorylation of redox-sensitive extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation. In addition, cafestol pretreatment increased Src homology region 2 domains-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) activity, suggesting that cafestol prevents ROS-induced SHP-2 inactivation. Moreover, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) translocation and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression were enhanced by cafestol. Addition of brusatol (a specific inhibitor of Nrf2) or Nrf2 siRNA significantly attenuated cafestol-mediated inhibitory effects on U-II-stimulated ROS production and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In summary, our data indicate that cafestol prevented U-II-induced cardiomycyte hypertrophy through Nrf2/HO-1 activation and inhibition of redox signaling, resulting in cardioprotective effects. These novel findings suggest that cafestol could be applied in pharmacological therapy for cardiac diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639264>Developmental differences in microglia morphology and gene expression during normal brain development and in response to hypoxia-ischemia.</a></h1><p>Neuroinflammation plays an important role in ischemic brain injury and recovery, however the interplay between brain development and the neuroinflammatory response is poorly understood. We previously described age-dependent differences in the microglial response and the effect of microglial inhibition. Here we investigate whether age-dependent microglial responses may be related to pre-injury developmental differences in microglial phenotype.Measures of microglia morphology were quantified using semi-automated software analysis of immunostained sections from postnatal day 2 (P2), P9, P30 and P60 mice using IMARIS. Microglia were isolated from P2, P9, P30 and P60 mice, and expression of markers of classical and alternative microglial activation was assessed, as well as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) receptor, Serpine1, Mer  Kinase (MerTK), and the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS3). Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) was induced in P9 and P30 mice using unilateral carotid artery ligation and exposure to 10%  for 50 min. Microglia morphology and microglial expression of genes in the TGF-β and MerTK pathways were determined in ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus.A progressive and significant increase in microglia branching morphology was seen in all brain regions from P2 to P30. No consistent classical or alternative activation profile was seen in isolated microglia. A clear transition to increased expression of TGF-β and its downstream effector serpine1 was seen between P9 and P30. A similar increase in expression was seen in MerTK and its downstream effector SOCS3. HI resulted in a significant decrease in branching morphology only in the P9 mice, and expression of TGF-β receptor, Serpine1, MerTK, and SOCS3 were elevated in P30 mice compared to P9 post-HI.Microglia maturation is associated with changes in morphology and gene expression, and microglial responses to ischemia in the developing brain differ based on the age at which injury occurs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Among RNS,  nitration, the addition of an NO group to a  residue, can modulate reduced nicotinamide-dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-generating systems and, therefore, can alter the levels of NADPH, a key cofactor in cellular redox homeostasis. NADPH also acts as an indispensable electron donor within a wide range of enzymatic reactions, biosynthetic pathways, and detoxification processes, which could affect plant viability. To extend our knowledge about the regulation of this key cofactor by this nitric oxide (NO)-related post-translational modification, we analyzed the effect of  nitration on another NADPH-generating enzyme, the NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), under LT stress. In  seedlings exposed to short-term LT (4 °C for 48 h), a 50% growth reduction accompanied by an increase in the content of superoxide, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite, in addition to diminished cytosolic NADP-ME activity, were found. In vitro assays confirmed that peroxynitrite inhibits cytosolic NADP-ME2 activity due to  nitration. The mass spectrometric analysis of nitrated NADP-ME2 enabled us to determine that Tyr-73 was exclusively nitrated to 3-nitrotyrosine by peroxynitrite. The in silico analysis of the  NADP-ME2 protein sequence suggests that Tyr73 nitration could disrupt the interactions between the specific amino acids responsible for protein structure stability. In conclusion, the present data show that short-term LT stress affects the metabolism of ROS and RNS, which appears to negatively modulate the activity of cytosolic NADP-ME through the  nitration process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668822>Algal Protein Kinase, Triacylglycerol Accumulation Regulator 1, Modulates Cell Viability and Gametogenesis in Carbon/Nitrogen-Imbalanced Conditions.</a></h1><p>Nutrient-deprived microalgae accumulate triacylglycerol (TAG) in lipid droplets. A dual-specificity  phosphorylation-regulated kinase, TAG accumulation regulator 1 (TAR1) has been shown to be required for acetate-dependent TAG accumulation and the degradation of chlorophyll and photosynthesis-related proteins in photomixotrophic nitrogen (N)-deficient conditions (Kajikawa etï¿½al. 2015). However, this previous report only examined particular condition. Here, we report that in photoautotrophic N-deficient conditions, tar1-1 cells, with a mutation in the TAR1 gene, maintained higher levels of cell viability and lower levels of hydrogen peroxide generation and accumulated higher levels of TAG and starch compared with those of wild type (WT) cells with bubbling of air containing 5% carbon dioxide. Transcriptomic analyses suggested that genes involved in the scavenging of reactive  species are not repressed in tar1-1 cells. In contrast, the mating efficiency and mRNA levels of key regulatory genes for gametogenesis, MID, MTD and FUS, were suppressed in tar1-1 cells. Among the TAR1-dependent phosphopeptides deduced by phosphoproteomic analysis, protein kinases and enzymes related to N assimilation and carbon (C) metabolism are of particular interest. Characterization of these putative downstream factors may elucidate the molecular pathway whereby TAR1 mediates cellular propagation and C and N metabolism in C/N-imbalanced stress conditions.ï¿½ The Author(s) 2019.

Thus, structural oxidative and nitrosative damage to proteins and DNA occurs. We aimed to asses these events in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of pediatric BM patients. Phenylalanine (Phe), para- (p-Tyr), nucleoside 2'-deoxiguanosine (2dG), and biomarkers of ROS/RNS-induced protein and DNA oxidation: ortho- (o-Tyr), 3-chlorotyrosine (3Cl-Tyr), 3-nitrotyrosine (3NO₂-Tyr) and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG), concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in the initial CSF of 79 children with BM and 10 without BM. All biomarkers, normalized with their corresponding precursors, showed higher median concentrations ( < 0.0001) in BM compared with controls, except 8OHdG/2dG. The ratios o-Tyr/Phe, 3Cl-Tyr/p-Tyr and 3NO₂-Tyr/p-Tyr were 570, 20 and 4.5 times as high, respectively. A significantly higher 3Cl-Tyr/p-Tyr ratio was found in BM caused by , than by  type b, or  ( = 0.002 for both). In conclusion, biomarkers indicating oxidative damage to proteins distinguished BM patients from non-BM, most clearly the o-Tyr/Phe ratio. The high 3Cl-Tyr/p-Tyr ratio in pneumococcal meningitis suggests robust inflammation because 3Cl-Tyr is a marker of MPO activation and, indirectly, of inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606550>Modulation of FLT3 signal transduction through cytoplasmic cysteine residues indicates the potential for redox regulation.</a></h1><p>Oxidative modification of cysteine residues has been shown to regulate the activity of several protein- kinases. We explored the possibility that Fms-like  kinase 3 (FLT3), a hematopoietic receptor- kinase, is subject to this type of regulation. An underlying rationale was that the FLT3 gene is frequently mutated in Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients, and resulting oncogenic variants of FLT3 with 'internal tandem duplications (FLT3ITD)' drive production of reactive  in leukemic cells. FLT3 was moderately activated by treatment of intact cells with hydrogen peroxide. Conversely, FLT3ITD signaling was attenuated by cell treatments with agents inhibiting formation of reactive  species. FLT3 and FLT3ITD incorporated DCP-Bio1, a reagent specifically reacting with sulfenic acid residues. Mutation of FLT3ITD cysteines 695 and 790 reduced DCP-Bio1 incorporation, suggesting that these sites are subject to oxidative modification. Functional characterization of individual FLT3ITD cysteine-to-serine mutants of all 8 cytoplasmic cysteines revealed phenotypes in kinase activity, signal transduction and cell transformation. Replacement of cysteines 681, 694, 695, 807, 925, and 945 attenuated signaling and blocked FLT3ITD-mediated cell transformation, whereas mutation of cysteine 790 enhanced activity of both FLT3ITD and wild-type FLT3. These effects were not related to altered FLT3ITD dimerization, but likely caused by changed intramolecular interactions. The findings identify the functional relevance of all cytoplasmic FLT3ITD cysteines, and indicate the potential for redox regulation of this clinically important oncoprotein.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Uncovering genes and mechanisms that affect aggregation dynamics would greatly help increase our understanding of the disease and lead to potential therapeutics. We developed a quantitative high-throughput  S2R+ cell-based kinetic assay coupled with fluorescent microscopy to score for genes involved in the modulation of aggregates of the fly orthologue, VAP(P58S), fused with GFP. A targeted RNA interference screen against 900 genes identified 150 hits that modify aggregation, including the ALS loci  and  (also known as ), as well as genes belonging to the mTOR pathway. Further, a system to measure the extent of VAP(P58S) aggregation in the  larval brain was developed in order to validate the hits from the cell-based screen. In the larval brain, we find that reduction of SOD1 levels or decreased mTOR signalling reduces aggregation, presumably by increasing the levels of cellular reactive  species (ROS). The mechanism of aggregate clearance is, primarily, proteasomal degradation, which appears to be triggered by an increase in ROS. We have thus uncovered an interesting interplay between SOD1, ROS and mTOR signalling that regulates the dynamics of VAP aggregation. Mechanistic processes underlying such cellular regulatory networks will lead to better understanding of the initiation and progression of ALS.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.© 2019.

Among these, protein  kinase signaling has received specific interest due to their common roles in various diseases including cancer, and emerging observations indicating that this signaling pathway is susceptible to regulation by reactive  species (ROS) that are also frequently implicated in disease pathology. While it is well recognized that ROS can impact on  kinase signaling by inhibiting  phosphatases, more recent studies highlight additional modes of redox-based regulation of  kinase signaling by direct redox modification of non-catalytic cysteines within  kinases or other protein components of this signaling pathway. In this review, we will present recent advancements with respect to redox-based mechanisms in regulating protein  kinase signaling, with a specific focus on recent studies demonstrating direct redox regulation of Src-family kinases and epidermal growth factor receptor kinases.

These two processes are associated with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aimed to investigate the role of miR-21 in the development of PD. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP) was used to induce a PD-like model in MES23.5 cells. The results of the reverse transcription-quantitative PCR assays indicated that miR-21 levels were markedly increased in MES23.5 cells following MPP treatment. Furthermore, MES23.5 cells were transfected with miR-21 inhibitor, mimics and/or relevant negative control, following MPP administration. The results of the functional assays revealed that downregulation of miR-21 significantly attenuated the induction of cell apoptosis and reactive  species (ROS) production, while it enhanced the survival of MPP-induced MES23.5 cells. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-21 increased the expression levels of  hydroxylase, whereas suppression of miR-21 inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α] in MES23.5 cells. Western blot analysis further indicated that the Bcl-2/Bax protein expression ratio was significantly increased and double luciferase assay analysis confirmed that Bcl-2 was a direct target of miR-21. Taken collectively, the data demonstrated that downregulation of miR-21 protected cells from MPP-mediated cytotoxicity by the inhibition of apoptosis induction, the reduction of the inflammatory response and the suppression of ROS production.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of telmisartan on macrophage polarization in association with its browning capacity, because PPARγ plays a key role in M2 polarization and in the browning of white adipocytes. Telmisartan induced M2 marker expression in murine macrophages concentration dependently, which was confirmed by flow cytometry. Both PPARγ and PPARδ activations appear to be responsible for telmisartan-induced M2 polarization. Telmisartan-treated conditioned medium (Tel-CM) of RAW264.7 cells and of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) induced the expressions of browning markers in fully differentiated white adipocytes with reduced lipid droplets, and increased  consumption rate and mitochondrial biogenesis. Levels of catecholamines (CA) released into the conditioned medium as well as intracellular  hydroxylase (TH) mRNAs were found to be increased by telmisartan, and browning effects of Tel-CM were lessened by β3 receptor antagonist (L-748,337), suggesting CA secreted into CM play a role in Tel-CM-induced adipocyte browning. Acute administration of telmisartan (2 weeks, p.o.) to C57BL/6J mice increased the expressions of browning markers and M2 markers in white adipose tissues, whereas macrophage depletion by clodronate liposome pretreatment attenuated the telmisartan-induced expressions of browning markers. Together, telmisartan was observed to induce the browning of fully differentiated white adipocytes, at least in part, via PPAR activation-mediated M2 polarization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070476>Endothelial-Specific Deficiency of ATG5 (Autophagy Protein 5) Attenuates Ischemia-Related Angiogenesis.</a></h1><p>Objective- Pathological angiogenesis, such as exuberant retinal neovascularization during proliferative retinopathies, involves endothelial responses to ischemia/hypoxia and oxidative stress. Autophagy is a clearance system enabling bulk degradation of intracellular components and is implicated in cellular adaptation to stressful conditions. Here, we addressed the role of the ATG5 (autophagy-related protein 5) in endothelial cells in the context of pathological ischemia-related neovascularization in the murine model of retinopathy of prematurity. Approach and Results- Autophagic vesicles accumulated in neovascular tufts of the retina of retinopathy of prematurity mice. Endothelium-specific Atg5 deletion reduced pathological neovascularization in the retinopathy of prematurity model. In contrast, no alterations in physiological retina vascularization were observed in endothelial-specific ATG5 deficiency, suggesting a specific role of endothelial ATG5 in pathological hypoxia/reoxygenation-related angiogenesis. Consistently, in an aortic ring angiogenesis assay, endothelial ATG5 deficiency resulted in impaired angiogenesis under hypoxia/reoxygenation conditions. As compared to ATG5-sufficient endothelial cells, ATG5-deficient cells displayed impaired mitochondrial respiratory activity, diminished production of mitochondrial reactive  species and decreased phosphorylation of the VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2). Consistently, ATG5-deficient endothelial cells displayed decreased oxidative inactivation of PTPs (phospho- phosphatases), likely due to the reduced reactive  species levels resulting from ATG5 deficiency. Conclusions- Our data suggest that endothelial ATG5 supports mitochondrial function and proangiogenic signaling in endothelial cells in the context of pathological hypoxia/reoxygenation-related neovascularization. Endothelial ATG5, therefore, represents a potential target for the treatment of pathological neovascularization-associated diseases, such as retinopathies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573411>Effects of the application of general anesthesia with propofol during the early stage of pregnancy on brain development and function of SD rat offspring and the intervention of DHA.</a></h1><p>: To investigate the effects of propofol used in early pregnancy on brain development and function of offspring, and further to explore the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intervention. : Forty pregnant rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (C), propofol group (P), DHA intervention group (D), and propofol + DHA group (P + D).

Here, we report that MET signaling plays an important role in conferring a unique metabolic phenotype to cellular models expressing MET-activating mutated variants that are either sensitive or resistant toward MET small molecule inhibitors. MET phosphorylation downregulated by the specific MET inhibitor tepotinib resulted in markedly decreased viability and increased apoptosis in tepotinib-sensitive cells. Moreover, prior to the induction of MET inhibition-dependent cell death, tepotinib also led to an altered metabolic signature, characterized by a prominent reduction of metabolite ions related to amino sugar metabolism, gluconeogenesis, glycine and serine metabolism, and of numerous TCA cycle-related metabolites such as succinate, malate, and citrate. Functionally, a decrease in  consumption rate, a reduced citrate synthase activity, a drop in membrane potential, and an associated misbalanced mitochondrial function were observed exclusively in MET inhibitor-sensitive cells. These data imply that interference with metabolic state can be considered an early indicator of efficient MET inhibition and particular changes reported here could be explored in the future as markers of efficacy of anti-MET therapies.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291585>Branched-Chain Amino Acid Metabolic Reprogramming Orchestrates Drug Resistance to EGFR  Kinase Inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Drug resistance is a significant hindrance to effective cancer treatment. Although resistance mechanisms of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant cancer cells to lethal EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKI) treatment have been investigated intensively, how cancer cells orchestrate adaptive response under sublethal drug challenge remains largely unknown. Here, we find that 2-h sublethal TKI treatment elicits a transient drug-tolerant state in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. Continuous sublethal treatment reinforces this tolerance and eventually establishes long-term TKI resistance. This adaptive process involves H3K9 demethylation-mediated upregulation of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1) and subsequent metabolic reprogramming, which promotes TKI resistance through attenuating reactive  species (ROS) accumulation. Combination treatment with TKI- and ROS-inducing reagents overcomes this drug resistance in preclinical mouse models. Clinical information analyses support the correlation of BCAT1 expression with the EGFR TKI response. Our findings reveal the importance of BCAT1-engaged metabolism reprogramming in TKI resistance in lung cancer.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, its heme cofactor is ligated by a proximal histidine, not cysteine. We show that LmbB2 can oxidize  analogs with ring-deactivated substituents such as 3-nitro-, fluoro-, chloro-, iodo-. We also found that the 4-hydroxyl group of the substrate is essential for reacting with the heme-based oxidant and activating the aromatic C-H bond. The most interesting observation of this study was obtained with 3-fluoro- as a substrate and mechanistic probe. The LmbB2-mediated catalytic reaction yielded two hydroxylated products with comparable populations, ., oxidative C-H bond cleavage at C5 to generate 3-fluoro-5-hydroxyl- and oxygenation at C3 concomitant with a carbon-fluorine bond cleavage to yield DOPA and fluoride. An iron protein-mediated hydroxylation on both C-H and C-F bonds with multiple turnovers is unprecedented. Thus, this finding reveals a significant potential of biocatalysis in C-H/C-X bond (X = halogen) cleavage. Further O-labeling results suggest that the source of  for hydroxylation is a peroxide, and that a commonly expected oxidation by a high-valent iron intermediate followed by hydrolysis is not supported for the C-F bond cleavage. Instead, the C-F bond cleavage is proposed to be initiated by a nucleophilic aromatic substitution mediated by the iron-hydroperoxo species. Based on the experimental results, two mechanisms are proposed to explain how LmbB2 hydroxylates the substrate and cleaves C-H/C-F bond. This study broadens the understanding of heme enzyme catalysis and sheds light on enzymatic applications in medicinal and environmental fields.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31259896>Nitropeptide Profiling and Identification Illustrated by Angiotensin II.</a></h1><p>Protein nitration is one of the most important post-translational modifications (PTM) on  residues and it can be induced by chemical actions of reactive  species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in eukaryotic cells. Precise identification of nitration sites on proteins is crucial for understanding the physiological and pathological processes related to protein nitration, such as inflammation, aging, and cancer. Since the nitrated proteins are of low abundance in cells even under induced conditions, no universal and efficient methods have been developed for the profiling and identification of protein nitration sites. Here we describe a protocol for nitropeptide enrichment by using a chemical reduction reaction and biotin labeling, followed by high resolution mass spectrometry. In our method, nitropeptide derivatives can be identified with high accuracy. Our method exhibits two advantages compared to the previously reported methods. First, dimethyl labeling is used to block the primary amine on nitropeptides, which can be used to generate quantitative results. Second, a disulfide bond containing NHS-biotin reagent is used for the enrichment, which can be further reduced and alkylated to enhance the detection signal on a mass spectrometer. This protocol has been successfully applied to the model peptide Angiotensin II in the current paper.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667594>Copper, dityrosine cross-links and amyloid-β aggregation.</a></h1><p>Copper is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) where it appears to affect the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and to catalyze the production of reactive  species (ROS). Oxidative stress apparently produces Aβ dimers that are covalently linked through two  residues. Such dityrosine cross-links are considered as potential markers of the disease and seem to be implicated in the pathological disorder. In the present study, pure o,o'-dityrosine (diY) was prepared enzymatically (with horseradish peroxidase; HRP), which was subsequently used to construct calibration lines aimed at quantifying nanomolar amounts of diY in reaction mixtures by fluorescence spectroscopy. Hence, diY concentrations down to 67 nM could be determined, which allowed to find that ca. 3% of dityrosine-bridged dimers of Aβ(1-40) were produced after 3 days at 37 °C in the presence of copper and dihydrogen peroxide. These cross-linked dimers in the presence of copper(II) ions completely inhibit the typical aggregation of Aβ, since β sheets could not be detected applying the usual Thioflavin T (ThT) method. Furthermore, the use of a potent Cu(II) chelator, such as the ATCUN tripeptide, L-histidyl-L-alanyl-L-histidine (HAH), efficiently prevented the copper-mediated generation of ROS and the associated dityrosine-bridged Aβ dimers, suggesting that such metal chelators may find future applications in the field of anti-AD drug design.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31438997>Topoisomerase inhibitors promote cancer cell motility via ROS-mediated activation of JAK2-STAT1-CXCL1 pathway.</a></h1><p>Topoisomerase inhibitors (TI) can inhibit cell proliferation by preventing DNA replication, stimulating DNA damage and inducing cell cycle arrest. Although these agents have been commonly used in the chemotherapy for the anti-proliferative effect, their impacts on the metastasis of cancer cells remain obscure.We used the transwell chamber assay to test effects of Topoisomerase inhibitors Etoposide (VP-16), Adriamycin (ADM) and Irinotecan (CPT-11) on the migration and invasion of cancer cells. Conditioned medium (CM) from TI-treated cells was subjected to Mass spectrometry screening. Gene silencing, neutralizing antibody, and specific chemical inhibitors were used to validate the roles of signaling molecules.Our studies disclosed that TI could promote the migration and invasion of a subset of cancer cells, which were dependent on chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1). Further studies disclosed that TI enhanced phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and Signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1). Silencing or chemical inhibition of JAK2 or STAT1 abrogated TI-induced CXCL1 expression and cell motility. Moreover, TI increased cellular levels of reactive  species (ROS) and promoted oxidation of Protein  Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), while reduced glutathione (GSH) reversed TI-induced JAK2-STAT1 activation, CXCL1 expression, and cell motility.Our study demonstrates that TI can promote the expression and secretion of CXCL1 by elevating ROS, inactivating PTP1B, and activating JAK2-STAT1 signaling pathway, thereby promoting the motility of cancer cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897181>Transcriptional profiles in the chicken ductus arteriosus during hatching.</a></h1><p>The ductus arteriosus, an essential embryonic blood vessel between the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta, constricts after birth or hatching and eventually closes to terminate embryonic circulation. Chicken embryos have two long ductus arteriosi, which anatomically differ from mammal ductus arteriosus. Each long ductus arteriosus is divided into two parts: the pulmonary artery-sided and descending aorta-sided ductus arteriosi. Although the pulmonary artery-sided and descending aorta-sided ductus arteriosi have distinct functional characteristics, such as  responsiveness, the difference in their transcriptional profiles has not been investigated. We performed a DNA microarray analysis (GSE 120116 at NCBI GEO) with pooled tissues from the chicken pulmonary artery-sided ductus arteriosus, descending aorta-sided ductus arteriosus, and aorta at the internal pipping stage. Although several known ductus arteriosus-dominant genes such as tfap2b were highly expressed in the pulmonary artery-sided ductus arteriosus, we newly found genes that were dominantly expressed in the chicken pulmonary artery-sided ductus arteriosus. Interestingly, cluster analysis showed that the expression pattern of the pulmonary artery-sided ductus arteriosus was closer to that of the descending aorta-sided ductus arteriosus than that of the aorta, whereas the morphology of the descending aorta-sided ductus arteriosus was closer to that of the aorta than that of the pulmonary artery-sided ductus arteriosus. Subsequent pathway analysis with DAVID bioinformatics resources revealed that the pulmonary artery-sided ductus arteriosus showed enhanced expression of the genes involved in melanogenesis and  metabolism compared with the descending aorta-sided ductus arteriosus, suggesting that tyrosinase and the related genes play an important role in the proper differentiation of neural crest-derived cells during vascular remodeling in the ductus arteriosus. In conclusion, the transcription profiles of the chicken ductus arteriosus provide new insights for investigating the mechanism of ductus arteriosus closure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261663>Carbon Monoxide Releasing Molecule-2-Upregulated ROS-Dependent Heme Oxygenase-1 Axis Suppresses Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Airway Inflammation.</a></h1><p>The up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is mediated through nicotinamaide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (Nox) and reactive  species (ROS) generation, which could provide cytoprotection against inflammation. However, the molecular mechanisms of carbon monoxide-releasing molecule (CORM)-2-induced HO-1 expression in human tracheal smooth muscle cells (HTSMCs) remain unknown. Here, we found that pretreatment with CORM-2 attenuated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) expression and leukocyte count through the up-regulation of HO-1 in mice, which was revealed by immunohistochemistrical staining, Western blot, real-time PCR, and cell count. The inhibitory effects of HO-1 by CORM-2 were reversed by transfection with HO-1 siRNA. Next, Western blot, real-time PCR, and promoter activity assay were performed to examine the HO-1 induction in HTSMCs. We found that CORM-2 induced HO-1 expression via the activation of protein kinase C (PKC)α and proline-rich  kinase (Pyk2), which was mediated through Nox-derived ROS generation using pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs). CORM-2-induced HO-1 expression was mediated through Nox-(1, 2, 4) or p47, which was confirmed by transfection with their own siRNAs. The Nox-derived ROS signals promoted the activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Subsequently, c-Fos and c-Jun-activator protein-1 (AP-1) subunits-were up-regulated by activated ERK1/2, which turned on transcription of the HO-1 gene by regulating the HO-1 promoter. These results suggested that in HTSMCs, CORM-2 activates PKCα/Pyk2-dependent Nox/ROS/ERK1/2/AP-1, leading to HO-1 up-regulation, which suppresses the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced airway inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573955>Identification of FES as a novel radiosensitizing target in human cancers.</a></h1><p>The identification of novel targets for developing synergistic drug-radiation combinations would pave the way to overcome tumor radioresistance. We conducted cell-based screening of a human kinome siRNA library to identify a radiation-specific kinase that has a synergistic toxic effect with radiation upon inhibition and is not essential for cell survival in the absence of radiation.Unbiased RNAi screening was performed by transfecting A549 cells with a human kinome siRNA library followed by irradiation. Radiosensitizing effects of a target gene and involved mechanisms were examined.We identified the non-receptor protein  kinase FES as a radiosensitizing target. The expression of FES was increased in response to irradiation. Cell viability and clonogenic survival after irradiation were significantly decreased by FES knockdown in lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines. In contrast, FES depletion alone did not significantly affect cell proliferation without irradiation. An inducible RNAi mouse xenograft model verified in vivo radiosensitizing effects. FES-depleted cells showed increased apoptosis, DNA damage, G2/M phase arrest, and mitotic catastrophe after irradiation. FES depletion promoted radiation-induced reactive  species formation, which resulted in phosphorylation of S6K and MDM2. The radiosensitizing effect of FES knockdown was partially reversed by inhibition of S6K activity. Consistent with the increase in phosphorylated MDM2, an increase in nuclear p53 levels was observed, which appears to contribute increased radiosensitivity of FES-depleted cells.We uncovered that inhibition of FES could be a potential strategy for inducing radiosensitization in cancer. Our results provide the basis for developing novel radiosensitizers.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614143>Neurotensin receptors regulate transactivation of the EGFR and HER2 in a reactive  species-dependent manner.</a></h1><p>Neurotensin is a 13 amino acid peptide which is present in many lung cancer cell lines. Neurotensin binds with high affinity to the neurotensin receptor 1, and functions as an autocrine growth factor in lung cancer cells. Neurotensin increases  phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the neurotensin receptor 1 antagonist SR48692 blocks the transactivation of the EGFR. Here the effects of reactive  species on the transactivation of the EGFR and HER2 were investigated. Using non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, neurotensin receptor 1 mRNA and protein were present. Using NCI-H838 cells, neurotensin or neurotensin but not neurotensin increased EGFR, ERK and HER2  phosphorylation which was blocked by SR48692. Neurotensin addition to NCI-H838 cells increased significantly reactive  species which was inhibited by SR48692, Tiron (superoxide scavenger) and diphenylene iodonium (DPI inhibits the ability of NADPH oxidase and dual oxidase enzymes to produce reactive  species). Tiron or DPI impaired the ability of neurotensin to increase EGFR, ERK and HER2  phosphorylation. Neurotensin stimulated NSCLC cellular proliferation whereas the growth was inhibited by SR48692, DPI or lapatinib (lapatinib is  kinase inhibitor of the EGFR and HER2). Lapatinib inhibited the ability of the neurotensin receptor 1 to transactivate the EGFR and HER2. The results indicate that neurotensin receptor 1 regulates the transactivation of the EGFR and HER2 in a reactive  species-dependent manner.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467840>Herbal medicine (Hepad) prevents dopaminergic neuronal death in the rat MPTP model of Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The purpose of this study was to examine neuroprotective effects of Hepad S1, an herbal medicine used for the treatment of PD, in  and  models of PD.Differentiated neuronal PC12 cells underwent a cytotoxicity assay and oxidative stress analysis including DCF-DA staining, glutathione, and malondialdehyde, after exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridium (MPP+). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD models. After 4-week oral administration of Hepad S1 (200, 300, 400, and 500 mg/kg/day), the levels of complex enzyme I activity and dopamine, and dopaminergic neuronal cell number in substantia nigra were measured by enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) and microscopic observation, respectively. Circulating serotonin and orexin A were also examined by ELISA.Hepad S1 pretreatment prevented the ability of MPP+ challenge to decrease glutathione and increase lipid peroxidation in cells, indicating antioxidant activity. Hepad S1 recovered MPTP-induced decreases in complex I enzyme activity and enhanced dopamine availability in substantia nigra.

In Hb M iron is present in the oxidized ferric state (Fe) not in the reduced ferrous form (Fe) and this reduces the ability of hemoglobin to bind . The described rare hemoglobin variant Hb M‑Hyde Park (also known as Hb M-Akita) results from the substitution of amino acid  by histidine at position 93 of the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin. The rare Hb variant Hb M‑Hyde Park (Hb M‑Akita) is mainly inherited autosomal dominant and causes methemoglobinemia. Due to the low frequency of inherited Hb M variants, the diagnosis is challenging.

Here, we describe the function of YW dyads in de novo designed 18-mer, β hairpins. In Peptide M, a YW dyad is formed between W14 and Y5. A UV hypochromic effect and an excitonic Cotton signal are observed, in addition to singlet, excited state (W*) and fluorescence emission spectral shifts. In a second Peptide, Peptide MW, a Y5-W13 dyad is formed diagonally across the strand and distorts the backbone. On a picosecond timescale, the W* excited-state decay kinetics are similar in all peptides but are accelerated relative to amino acids in solution. In Peptide MW, the W* spectrum is consistent with increased conformational flexibility. In Peptide M and MW, the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra obtained after UV photolysis are characteristic of  and tryptophan radicals at 160 K. Notably, at pH 9, the radical photolysis yield is decreased in Peptide M and MW, compared to that in a  and tryptophan mixture. This protective effect is not observed at pH 11 and is not observed in peptides containing a tryptophan-histidine dyad or tryptophan alone. The YW dyad protective effect is attributed to an increase in the radical recombination rate. This increase in rate can be facilitated by hydrogen-bonding interactions, which lower the barrier for the PCET reaction at pH 9. These results suggest that the YW dyad structural motif promotes radical quenching under conditions of reactive  stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30733301>HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor FG-4497 enhances mouse hematopoietic stem cell mobilization via VEGFR2/KDR.</a></h1><p>In normoxia, hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) are rapidly degraded within the cytoplasm as a consequence of their prolyl hydroxylation by -dependent prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes. We have previously shown that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) require HIF-1 for effective mobilization in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100/plerixafor. Conversely, HIF PHD inhibitors that stabilize HIF-1 protein in vivo enhance HSPC mobilization in response to G-CSF or AMD3100 in a cell-intrinsic manner. We now show that extrinsic mechanisms involving vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), via bone marrow (BM) endothelial cells, are also at play. PTK787/vatalanib, a  kinase inhibitor selective for VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and neutralizing anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody DC101 blocked enhancement of HSPC mobilization by FG-4497. VEGFR2 was absent on mesenchymal and hematopoietic cells and was detected only in Sca1 endothelial cells in the BM. We propose that HIF PHD inhibitor FG-4497 enhances HSPC mobilization by stabilizing HIF-1α in HSPCs as previously demonstrated, as well as by activating VEGFR2 signaling in BM endothelial cells, which facilitates HSPC egress from the BM into the circulation.© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30824700> phosphorylation activates 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and promotes tumor growth and radiation resistance.</a></h1><p>6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) is a key enzyme that converts 6-phosphogluconate into ribulose-5-phosphate with NADP as cofactor in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). 6PGD is commonly upregulated and plays important roles in many human cancers, while the mechanism underlying such roles of 6PGD remains elusive. Here we show that upon EGFR activation, 6PGD is phosphorylated at  (Y) 481 by Src family kinase Fyn. This phosphorylation enhances 6PGD activity by increasing its binding affinity to NADP and therefore activates the PPP for NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate, which consequently detoxifies intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and accelerates DNA synthesis. Abrogating 6PGD Y481 phosphorylation (pY481) dramatically attenuates EGF-promoted glioma cell proliferation, tumor growth and resistance to ionizing radiation. In addition, 6PGD pY481 is associated with Fyn expression, the malignancy and prognosis of human glioblastoma.

For experiments, mice were divided into either the OIR group or control group. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran cardiac perfusion and stretched retina preparation were performed. The total retina area, area of instillation, density of microvascular network, area of new blood vessels, vein width and the tortuosity of arteries were measured. Next, mice were randomly assigned into the PBS, soluble TEK receptor  kinase (sTie2)-fusion protein (Fc), angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), ranibizumab, ranibizumab + sTie2-Fc and ranibizumab + Ang1 treatment groups. Following housing for 5 days, the body weight of each mouse was recorded. Mice in the OIR group presented smaller total retina area and larger area of instillation, larger area of new blood vessels, and higher microvascular network density compared with the control PBS group. Obvious retinal vein dilatation and arterial tortuosity were identified in the OIR group. The amount of endotheliocyte nuclei of new vessels beyond the inner limiting membrane was larger in the OIR group compared with the control group. Furthermore in the next set of experiments, a larger area of instillation, smaller area of new blood vessels and decreased amount of endotheliocyte nuclei of new vessels were observed in the sTie2-Fc group, Ang1 group, ranibizumab group, ranibizumab + sTie2-Fc group and ranibizumab + Ang1 group compared with the PBS group. Specifically, the ranibizumab + sTie2-Fc group and ranibizumab + Ang1 group demonstrated markedly reduced retina instillation area and microvascular network density in the instillation area. Total retina area and body weight following 10 days of the experiment for the ranibizumab group were significantly lower compared with other groups. In conclusion, the combined regulation of the Ang/Tie2 and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor pathways markedly increased the efficacy of treatment with retinal neovascularization (RNV).

This compound is increasingly used as a marker of aging, stress and pathogenesis. At physiological pH, Tyr2 is able to absorb radiation at wavelengths significantly present in the solar radiation and artificial sources of light. As a result, when Tyr2 is formed in vivo, a new chromophore appears in the proteins. Despite the biomedical importance of Tyr2, the information of its photochemical properties is limited due to the drawbacks of its synthesis. Therefore, in this work we demonstrate that at physiological pH, Tyr2 undergoes oxidation upon UV excitation yielding different products which conserve the dimeric structure. During its photodegradation different reactive  species, like hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion and singlet , are produced. Otherwise, we demonstrated that Tyr2 is able to sensitize the photodegradation of .

Additionally, p66Shc controls the expression and function of chemokine receptors that regulate lymphocyte traffic. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells have a p66Shc expression defect which contributes to their extended survival and correlates with poor prognosis. We analyzed the impact of p66Shc ablation on disease severity and progression in the Eμ-TCL1 mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We showed that Eμ-TCL1/p66Shc mice developed an aggressive disease that had an earlier onset, occurred at a higher incidence and led to earlier death compared to that in Eμ-TCL1 mice. Eμ-TCL1/p66Shc mice displayed substantial leukemic cell accumulation in both nodal and extranodal sites. The target organ selectivity correlated with upregulation of chemokine receptors whose ligands are expressed therein. This also applied to chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, where chemokine receptor expression and extent of organ infiltration were found to correlate inversely with these cells' level of p66Shc expression. p66Shc expression declined with disease progression in Eμ-TCL1 mice and could be restored by treatment with the Bruton  kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. Our results highlight p66Shc deficiency as an important factor in the progression and severity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and underscore p66Shc expression as a relevant therapeutic target.Copyright© 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31165168>Toxicoproteomic Analysis of Poly(ADP-ribose)-associated Proteins Induced by Oxidative Stress in Human Proximal Tubule Cells.</a></h1><p>2,3,5-Tris-(glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone (TGHQ) is a nephrotoxic and nephrocarcinogenic metabolite of hydroquinone. TGHQ generates ROS, causing DNA strand breaks, hyperactivation of PARP-1, increases in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), and cell death. PARP-1 catalyzes the attachment of ADP-ribose polymers (PAR) to target proteins. In human kidney proximal tubule cells (HK-2), ROS-mediated PARP-1 hyperactivation and elevations in [Ca2+]i are reciprocally coupled. The molecular mechanism of this interaction is unclear. The aim of the present study was to identify ROS-induced PAR-associated proteins to further understand their potential role in cell death. PAR-associated proteins were enriched by immunoprecipitation, identified by LC-MS/MS, and relative abundance was obtained by spectral counting. 356 proteins were PAR-modified following TGHQ treatment. 13 proteins exhibited gene ontology annotations related to calcium. Among these proteins, the general transcription factor II-I (TFII-I) is directly involved in the modulation of [Ca2+]i. TFII-I binding to phospholipase C (PLC) leads to calcium influx via the TRPC3 channel. However, inhibition of TRPC3 or PLC had no effect on TGHQ-mediated cell death, suggesting that their loss of function may be necessary but insufficient to cause cell death. Nevertheless, TGHQ promoted a time-dependent translocation of TFII-I from the nucleus to the cytosol concomitant with a decrease in  phosphorylation in α/β-TFII-I. Therefore it is likely that ROS have an important impact on the function of TFII-I, such as regulation of transcription, and DNA translesion synthesis. Our data also sheds light on PAR mediated signaling during oxidative stress, and contributes to the development of strategies to prevent PAR-dependent cell death.© The Author(s) 2019.

The objective of this study was to determine the dietary protein requirement of healthy young ET men (≥1 yr training experience) 24 h post exercise (to minimize any acute effects of the previous training session) by measuring the oxidation of ingested l-[1-C]phenylalanine to CO in response to graded intakes of protein (indicator amino acid oxidation technique). Eight men [maximal  consumption 64.1 ml·kg·min (SD 3.7)] were each studied 24 h postexercise repeatedly with protein intakes ranging from 0.3 to 3.5 g·kg·day. Protein was fed as an amino acid mixture based on the protein pattern in egg, except for phenylalanine and , which were maintained at constant amounts across all protein intakes. For 2 days before the study day, all participants consumed 1.6 g protein·kg·day. The estimated average requirement (EAR) for protein was determined by applying a nonlinear mixed-effects change-point regression analysis to FCO (label tracer oxidation in CO breath), which identified a breakpoint in the FCO in response to the graded amounts of protein. The EAR for protein and the upper 95% confidence interval were 2.1 and 2.6 g·kg·day, respectively. These data suggest that the protein EAR for ET men 24 h postexercise exceeds the Institute of Medicine EAR and established athlete guidelines by ~3.5- and 1.3-fold, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285420>4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase promotes lung cancer growth via pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux mediated by LKB1-AMPK/HDAC10/G6PD axis.</a></h1><p>4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD) is an important modifier of  metabolism. However, the precise contribution of HPD to cancer metabolism and tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we found that HPD was highly expressed in lung cancer and its higher expression correlated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Suppressed HPD expression was sufficient to decrease oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux, leading to reduced RNA biosynthesis and enhanced reactive  species (ROS) level, attenuated cancer cell proliferation, and tumor growth. Mechanistically, HPD not only promotes  catabolism leading to increased acetyl-CoA levels, the source of histone acetylation, but also stimulates histone deacetylase 10 (HDAC10) translocation from the nucleus into the cytoplasm mediated by tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. Both controlled histone acetylation modification, which enhanced transcription of the important PPP enzyme Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD). Thus, this study reveals HPD as a novel regulator of LKB1-AMPK signaling-mediated HDAC10 nuclear location, which contributes to G6PD expression in promoting tumor growth, which is a promising target for lung cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478251>Mac-1 triggers neutrophil DNA extracellular trap formation to Aspergillus fumigatus independently of PAD4 histone citrullination.</a></h1><p>Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is an environmental fungus and a human pathogen. Neutrophils are critical effector cells during the fungal infections, and neutropenia is a risk factor for the development of pulmonary aspergillosis. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are released by neutrophils in response to A. fumigatus and inhibit the conidial germination. In this work, we observed that the receptors TLR2, TLR4, and Dectin-1 were dispensable for the A. fumigatus induced NET release. In contrast CD11b/CD18 was critical for the NET release in response to A. fumigatus conidia, and this required the CD11b I-domain-mediated recognition, whereas the blockade of the CD11b lectin domain did not affect the A. fumigatus induced NET release. A. fumigatus induced NET release relied on the activity of spleen  kinase (Syk), Src family kinase(s), and class IA PI3 kinase δ. Although A. fumigatus promoted histone citrullination, this process was dispensable for the NET release in response to A. fumigatus conidia. The A. fumigatus induced NET release required the reactive  species generation by the NOX2 complex, in a downstream pathway requiring CD11b/CD18, Src kinase family activity, Syk and PI3K class IA δ. Our findings thus reveal the signaling pathways involved in the formation of NETs in response to A. fumigatus.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636810>Lysosomal Destabilizing Drug Siramesine and the Dual  Kinase Inhibitor Lapatinib Induce a Synergistic Ferroptosis through Reduced Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) Levels.</a></h1><p>Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent type of cell death distinct from apoptosis or necrosis characterized by accumulation of reactive  species. The combination of siramesine, a lysosomotropic agent, and lapatinib, a dual  kinase inhibitor (TKI), synergistically induced cell death in breast cancer cells mediated by ferroptosis. In this study, we showed that this combination of siramesine and lapatinib induces synergistic cell death in glioma cell line U87 and lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549. This cell death was characterized by the increase in iron content, reactive  species (ROS) production, and lipid peroxidation accumulation after 24 hours of treatment. Moreover, iron chelator DFO and ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, significantly reduced cell death. The mechanism underlying the activation of the ferroptotic pathway involves lysosomal permeabilization and increase in reactive iron levels in these cells. In addition, the downregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein occurred. Overexpression of HO-1 resulted in reduction of ROS and lipid peroxidation production and cell death. Furthermore, knocking down of HO-1 combined with siramesine treatment resulted in increased cell death. Finally, we found that the inhibition of the proteasome system rescued HO-1 expression levels. Our results suggest that the induction of ferroptosis by combining a lysosomotropic agent and a  kinase inhibitor is mediated by iron release from lysosomes and HO-1 degradation by the proteasome system.Copyright © 2019 Gloria E.

Does NADPH oxidase activation mediate cardiac sympathetic nerve denervation and dysfunction in heart failure. What is the main findings and its importance? Cardiac sympathetic nerve terminal density and function were reduced in heart failure after myocardial infarction in rabbits. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin prevented the reduction in cardiac sympathetic nerve terminal density and function in heart failure. This suggest that NADPH oxidase activation mediates cardiac sympathetic nerve terminal abnormalities in heart failure. NADPH oxidase may be a potential therapeutic target for cardiac sympathetic denervation and dysfunction in heart failure.Congestive heart failure (CHF) is characterized by cardiac sympathetic nerve terminal abnormalities, as evidenced by decreased noradrenaline transporter (NAT) density and cardiac catecholaminergic and  hydroxylase (TH) profiles. These alterations are associated with increased reactive  species (ROS). NADPH oxidase is a major source of ROS in CHF. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that NADPH oxidase activation mediates cardiac sympathetic nerve terminal abnormalities in CHF. CHF was produced by myocardial infarction (MI) in rabbits. Rabbits with MI or a sham operation were randomized to orally receive an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin (6 mg kg  day ), or placebo for 30 days. MI rabbits exhibited left ventricular dilatation, systolic dysfunction, and increases in NADPH oxidase activity and 4-hydroxynonenal expression in the remote non-infarcted myocardium, all of which were prevented by treatment with apocynin. Cardiac catecholaminergic histofluorescence profiles and immunostained TH and PGP9.5 expression were decreased, and the decreases were ameliorated by apocynin treatment. NAT, TH and PGP9.5 protein and mRNA expression were reduced and the reduction was mitigated by apocynin treatment. The effects of apocynin were confirmed by utilizing the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium in a separate experiment. In conclusion, the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin attenuated increased myocardial oxidative stress and decreased cardiac sympathetic nerve terminals in CHF after MI in rabbits. These findings suggest that the activation of NADPH oxidase mediates cardiac sympathetic nerve terminal abnormalities in CHF, and the inhibition of NADPH oxidase may be beneficial for the treatment of heart failure.© 2019 The Authors.

Reduced wheel running occurs when mice are fed a high-fat diet but is normalized when mice consume standard chow. The two phenotypes are due to altered output from different IMP2 client mRNAs. The reduced fiber size of IMP2-deficient muscle is attributable, in part, to diminished autocrine Igf2 production; basal  phosphorylation of the insulin and IGF1 receptors is diminished, and Akt1 activation is selectively reduced. Gsk3α is disinhibited, and S536-phosphorylated ε subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B [eIF2Bε(S536)] is hyperphosphorylated. Protein synthesis is reduced despite unaltered mTOR complex 1 activity. The diet-dependent reduction in voluntary exercise is likely due to altered muscle metabolism, as contractile function is normal. IMP2-deficient muscle exhibits reduced fatty acid oxidation, due to a reduced abundance of mRNA of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), an IMP2 client, and PPARα protein. IMP2-deficient muscle fibers treated with a mitochondrial uncoupler to increase electron flux, as occurs with exercise, exhibit reduced  consumption from fatty acids, with higher  consumption from glucose. The greater dependence on muscle glucose metabolism during increased  demand may promote central fatigue and thereby diminish voluntary activity.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30949504>Minocycline Protects against Rotenone-Induced Neurotoxicity Correlating with Upregulation of Nurr1 in a Parkinson's Disease Rat Model.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of minocycline in rats with rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease (PD). The open field test was performed to determine the motor ability of the rats. Double immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of  hydroxylase (TH) and Nurr1 in the substantia nigra (SN) of rats. The relative protein levels of TH, Nurr1, and the total- and phosphorylated-cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) were determined by western blot analysis. The production of reactive  species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) was detected by commercial kits. After exposure to rotenone for 28 days, rats exhibited decreased ambulation and rearing frequency and prolonged immobility time with loss of TH positive neurons in the SN. The phosphorylation levels of CREB and Nurr1 expression decreased significantly accompanied with the release of ROS and NO. Minocycline alleviated the motor deficits of rats lesioned by rotenone and elevated the expression of TH, as well as suppressing the release of ROS and NO in the SN. That was in line with the elevated phosphorylation levels of CREB and Nurr1 expression. In conclusion, our present study showed minocycline protected against neurotoxicity in a rotenone-induced rat model of PD, which was correlated with upregulation of Nurr1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034912>In vitro impact of amino acid-derived bacterial metabolites on colonocyte mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress response and DNA integrity.</a></h1><p>4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HO-PAA) is produced by intestinal microbiota from . High concentrations in human fecal water have been associated with cytotoxicity, urging us to test HO-PAA's effects on human colonocytes. We compared these effects with those of phenylacetic acid (PAA), phenol and acetaldehyde, also issued from amino acids fermentation.HT-29 Glc human colonocytes were exposed for 24 h to metabolites at concentrations between 350 and 1000 μM for HO-PAA and PAA, 250-1500 μM for phenol and 25-500 μM for acetaldehyde. We evaluated metabolites'cytotoxicity with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and DNA quantification assays, reactive  species (ROS) production with H2DCF-DA, and DNA damage with the comet assay. We measured cell  consumption and mitochondrial complexes activity by polarography.Although HO-PAA displayed no cytotoxic effect on colonocytes, it decreased mitochondrial complex I activity and  consumption. This was paralleled by an increase in ROS production and DNA alteration. Cells pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger, decreased genotoxic effects of HO-PAA, indicating implication of oxidative stress in HO-PAA's genotoxicity. PAA and phenol did not reproduce these effects, but were cytotoxic towards colonocytes. Last, acetaldehyde displayed no effect in terms of cytotoxicity and mitochondrial metabolic activity, but increased DNA damage.Several bacterial metabolites produced from amino acids displayed deleterious effects on human colonocytes, in terms of genotoxicity (HO-PAA and acetaldehyde) or cytotoxicity (PAA and phenol).This study helps understanding the consequences of intestinal microbiota's metabolic activity on the host since amino acids fermentation can lead to the formation of compounds toxic towards colonic epithelial cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, disproportionate levels of ROS in relation to antioxidants lead to oxidative stress (OS), which plays a key role in HIV disease progression and pathogenesis. There is a close relationship between oxidative stress status and HIV infection/progression, both separately and in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Biomarkers of oxidative stress present an additional means of monitoring HIV disease progression and/or management. Thus, the objective of this study was to apply untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics followed by targeted quantitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses to identify predictors of oxidative stress in HIV infected individuals, with or without cART. Untargeted NMR-based metabonomics allowed a global profiling of metabolic perturbations in HIV-infected sera. The cohort consisted of 21 HIV-negative control subjects (HIV) and 113 HIV-infected individuals, of which 100 were on cART. Significant differences in metabolic features corresponding to changes in glucose, lipids, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and branched amino acids were observed, which point to oxidative stress and insulin resistance. To further confirm oxidative stress, targeted GC/MS-based metabonomics, performed in succession, allowed for a quantitative description of a total of 9 oxidative stress-related metabolites. Significant up-regulation of aspartic acid, phenylalanine and glutamic acid were observed in the HIV-infected cohorts as compared to controls. Tryptophan and  were down-regulated whereas cystine levels were increased in HIV-infected and untreated individuals as compared to both HIV treated and negative control subjects. Pathway analysis also revealed 11 metabolic pathways to be significantly altered by infection and/or treatment. These pathways included aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism and phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis. This pilot study demonstrated the use of multiplatform metabonomic strategies to elucidate metabolic markers that would be essential in predicting HIV/cART-induced oxidative stress. This could aid and contribute in HIV treatment and management programmes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate gene transcription by deacetylating lysine residues in histone and nonhistone proteins and a heightened HDAC activation, notably of HDAC5, is associated with vascular disorders, such as atherosclerosis. Although the contribution of IGF-1 in these pathologies is well documented, its role in HDAC phosphorylation and activation remains unexplored. Here, we examined the effect of IGF-1 on HDAC5 phosphorylation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and identified the signaling pathways involved in controlling HDAC5 phosphorylation and nuclear export. Treatment of A10 VSMCs with IGF-1 enhanced HDAC5 phosphorylation. Blockade of the IGF-1 receptor  kinase (TK) activity with the specific pharmacological inhibitor, AG1024, significantly inhibited IGF-1-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation, whereas the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TK antagonist, AG1478, had no effect. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway with U0126, SP600125, or SB203580, did not affect HDAC5 phosphorylation, whereas two inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways, wortmannin and SC66, almost completely attenuated IGF-1-induced responses as confirmed by immunoblotting of phospho-HDAC5 and by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced AKT silencing. Moreover, the NAD(P)H oxidase (Nox) inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), and Nox4 siRNA, attenuated IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of HDAC5 and AKT. The HDAC5 phosphorylation resulted in its nuclear export, which was reversed by SC66 and DPI. Our results indicate that IGF-1-induced phosphorylation and nuclear export of HDAC5 involve Nox4-dependent ROS generation and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946568>Probing the Cys-Tyr Cofactor Biogenesis in Cysteine Dioxygenase by the Genetic Incorporation of Fluorotyrosine.</a></h1><p>Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) is a nonheme iron enzyme that adds two  atoms from dioxygen to the sulfur atom of l-cysteine. Adjacent to the iron site of mammalian CDO, there is a post-translationally generated Cys-Tyr cofactor, whose presence substantially enhances the oxygenase activity. The formation of the Cys-Tyr cofactor in CDO is an autocatalytic process, and it is challenging to study by traditional techniques because the cross-linking reaction is a side, uncoupled, single-turnover oxidation buried among multiple turnovers of l-cysteine oxygenation. Here, we take advantage of our recent success in obtaining a purely uncross-linked human CDO due to site-specific incorporation of 3,5-difluoro- (F-Tyr) at the cross-linking site through the genetic code expansion strategy. Using EPR spectroscopy, we show that nitric oxide (NO), an  surrogate, similarly binds to uncross-linked F-Tyr157 CDO as in wild-type human CDO. We determined X-ray crystal structures of uncross-linked F-Tyr157 CDO and mature wild-type CDO in complex with both l-cysteine and NO. These structural data reveal that the active site cysteine (Cys93 in the human enzyme), rather than the generally expected  (i.e., Tyr157), is well-aligned to be oxidized should the normal oxidation reaction uncouple. This structure-based understanding is further supported by a computational study with models built on the uncross-linked ternary complex structure. Together, these results strongly suggest that the first target to oxidize during the iron-assisted Cys-Tyr cofactor biogenesis is Cys93. Based on these data, a plausible reaction mechanism implementing a cysteine radical involved in the cross-link formation is proposed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285782>A Quantitative Method to Measure Low Levels of ROS in Nonphagocytic Cells by Using a Chemiluminescent Imaging System.</a></h1><p>Chemiluminescence (CL) is one of the most useful methods for detecting reactive  species (ROS). Although fluorescence dyes or genetically encoded biosensors have been developed, CL is still used due to its high sensitivity, ease of use, and low cost. While initially established and used to measure high levels of ROS in phagocytic cells, CL assays are not ideal for measuring low levels of ROS. Here, we developed a newly modified CL assay using a chemiluminescent imaging system for measuring low concentrations of ROS in nonphagocytic cells. We found that dissolving luminol in NaOH, rather than DMSO, increased the HO-induced CL signal and that the addition of 4-iodophenylboronic acid (4IPBA) further increased CL intensity. Our new system also increased the rate and intensity of the CL signal in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate- (PMA-) treated HT-29 colon cancer cells compared to those in luminol only. We were able to quantify ROS levels from both cells and media in parallel using an HO standard. A significant benefit to our system is that we can easily measure stimulus-induced ROS formation in a real-time manner and also investigate intracellular signaling pathways from a single sample simultaneously. We found that PMA induced  phosphorylation of protein  kinases (PTKs), such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), protein  kinase 2 (Pyk2), and Src, and increased actin stress fiber formation in a ROS-dependent manner. Interestingly, treatment with either N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) reduced the PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of these PTKs, implicating a potential role in cellular ROS signaling. Thus, our newly optimized CL assay using 4IPBA and a chemiluminescent imaging method provides a simple, real-time, and low-cost method for the quantification of low levels of ROS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171644>Ibrutinib induces multiple functional defects in the neutrophil response against Aspergillus fumigatus.</a></h1><p>Bruton's  kinase inhibitor ibrutinib has become a leading therapy against chronic lymphoid leukemia. Recently, ibrutinib has been associated with the occurrence of invasive fungal infections, in particular invasive aspergillosis. The mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility to fungal infections associated with ibrutinib exposure are currently unknown. Innate immunity, in particular polymorphonuclear neutrophils, represents the cornerstone of anti-Aspergillus immunity however the potential impact of ibrutinib on neutrophils has been little studied. Our study investigated the response to Aspergillus fumigatus and neutrophil function in patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia or lymphoma, who were undergoing ibrutinib therapy. To answer this question, we studied the consequences of ibrutinib exposure on the functions and anti-Aspergillus responses of neutrophils obtained from healthy donors and 63 blood samples collected at different time points amongst 32 patients receiving ibrutinib for lymphoid malignancies. We used both flow cytometry and video-microscopy approaches to analyze neutrophils' cell surface molecule expression, cytokine production, oxidative burst, chemotaxis and killing activity against Aspergillus. Ibrutinib is associated, both in vitro and in patients under treatment, with multiple functional defects in neutrophils, including decreased reactive  species production, impairment of their capacity to engulf Aspergillus and inability to efficiently kill germinating conidia. Our results demonstrate that ibrutinib-exposed neutrophils develop significant functional defects that impair their response against Aspergillus fumigatus, providing a plausible explanation for the emergence of invasive aspergillosis in ibrutinib-treated patients.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216465>Acquired Resistance of EGFR-Mutated Lung Cancer to  Kinase Inhibitor Treatment Promotes PARP Inhibitor Sensitivity.</a></h1><p>Lung cancers with oncogenic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) invariably acquire resistance to  kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. Vulnerabilities of EGFR TKI-resistant cancer cells that could be therapeutically exploited are incompletely understood. Here, we describe a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) inhibitor-sensitive phenotype that is conferred by TKI treatment in vitro and in vivo and appears independent of any particular TKI resistance mechanism. We find that PARP-1 protects cells against cytotoxic reactive  species (ROS) produced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX). Compared to TKI-naive cells, TKI-resistant cells exhibit signs of increased RAC1 activity. PARP-1 catalytic function is required for PARylation of RAC1 at evolutionarily conserved sites in TKI-resistant cells, which restricts NOX-mediated ROS production. Our data identify a role of PARP-1 in controlling ROS levels upon EGFR TKI treatment, with potentially broad implications for therapeutic targeting of the mechanisms that govern the survival of oncogene-driven cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

In the present study, we investigated the  sensitivity of selected pigments in thermally pasteurized vegetable purees held at a refrigeration temperature. We modulated the  ingress in packaging using multilayer films with OTRs of 1, 30 and 81 cm  m  day . Red cabbage, beetroot and pea purees were vacuum packed, pasteurized to achieve a cumulative lethality of  = 12.8-13.4 min and stored at 7 °C for 80 days.Anthocyanins were relatively stable (< 4% losses), regardless of the film OTR. Betalains showed the highest sensitivity to different OTRs, with total losses varying from 4% to 49% at the end of storage and showing significant differences (P < 0.05) among the three films. Chlorophylls showed no significant difference (P > 0.05) in sensitivity to film OTRs. However, continuous degradation of chlorophylls was observed for all film types, with total chlorophyll losses ranging from 33% to 35%. Overall color differences (ΔE) at the end of storage for cabbage, beet and pea puree were between 0.50-1.70, 1.00-4.55 and 7.41-8.08, respectively. Betalains and chlorophylls degradation followed first-order and fractional conversion kinetics, whereas ΔE followed zero-order and fractional conversion kinetics during storage.All three pigments behaved differently to  ingress during storage. Low to medium barrier films are suitable for products containing red cabbage anthocyanins. High barrier films are must for betalains, whereas medium to high barrier films are suitable for chlorophyll-containing products. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31039364>Ablation of B- and B-kinin receptors causes cardiac dysfunction through redox-nitroso unbalance.</a></h1><p>B- and B-kinin receptors play a major role in several cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate cardiac functional consequences of B- and B-kinin receptors ablation, focusing on the cardiac ROS and NO generation.Cardiac contractility, ROS, and NO generation, and protein expression were evaluated in male wild-type (WT), B- (B) and B-kinin (B) knockout mice.Impaired contractility in B and B hearts was associated with oxidative stress through upregulation of NADPH oxidase p22 subunit. B and B hearts presented higher NO and peroxynitrite levels than WT. Despite decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca ATPase pump (SERCA2) expression, nitration at  residues of SERCA2 was markedly higher in B and B hearts.B- and B-kinin receptors govern ROS generation, while disruption of B- and B-kinin receptors leads to impaired cardiac dysfunction through excessive  nitration on the SERCA2 structure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, IL-17A has a central role for the vascular infiltration of myeloid cells into the arterial wall in Angiotensin II-induced vascular inflammation. The intention of our study was to analyze the impact of T cell-derived IL-17A on hypertension, vascular function, and inflammation.Chronic IL-17A overexpression in T cells (CD4-IL-17A mice) resulted in elevated reactive  species in the peripheral blood and a significant vascular dysfunction compared to control mice. The vascular dysfunction seen in the CD4-IL-17A mice was only accompanied by a modest and nonsignificant accumulation of inflammatory cells within the vessel wall. Therefore, infiltrating myeloid cells did not serve as an explanation of the vascular dysfunction seen in a chronic IL-17A-driven mouse model. In addition to vascular dysfunction, CD4-IL-17A mice displayed vascular fibrosis with highly proliferative fibroblasts. This fibroblast proliferation was induced by exposure to IL-17A as confirmed by  experiments with primary murine fibroblastic cells. We also found that the NO/cGMP pathway was downregulated in the vasculature of the CD4-IL-17A mice, while levels of protein  kinase 2 (PYK2), an oxidative stress-triggered process associated with T cell activation, were upregulated in the perivascular fat tissue (PVAT).Our data demonstrate that T cell-derived IL-17A elicits vascular dysfunction by mediating proliferation of fibroblasts and subsequent vascular fibrosis associated with PYK2 upregulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30792526>Anti-inflammatory effect of afatinib (an EGFR-TKI) on OGD-induced neuroinflammation.</a></h1><p>Activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been proposed in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effect of afatinib, an EGFR- kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKIs) was investigated using CTX-TNA2 cells and primary cultured astrocytes subjected to /glucose deprivation (OGD). We found that OGD induced EGFR phosphorylation and activated subsequent signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Afatinib blocked OGD-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. At the same time, afatinib attenuated OGD-induced elevations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (a biomarker of activated astrocytes) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression (a cell proliferating biomarker) as well as hypoxia-induced migratory ability. Furthermore, afatinib decreased OGD-induced increases in cyclooxygenase-II and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression of the treated astrocytes as well as NO content in the culture medium. Moreover, afatinib attenuated OGD-induced caspase 1 activation (a biomarker of inflammasome activation) and interleukin-1β levels (a pro-inflammatory cytokine). Collectively, afatinib could block OGD-induced EGFR activation and its downstream signaling pathways in astrocytes. Moreover, afatinib attenuated OGD-induced astrocyte activation, proliferation and inflammasome activation. These data support the involvement of EGFR activation in neuroinflammation. Furthermore, EGFR-TKIs may be promising in inhibiting neuroinflammation in the CNS neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390228>Angiotensin II deteriorates advanced atherosclerosis by promoting MerTK cleavage and impairing efferocytosis through the ATR/ROS/p38 MAPK/ADAM17 pathway.</a></h1><p>Vulnerable plaques in advanced atherosclerosis have defective efferocytosis. The role of ANG II in the progression of atherosclerosis is not fully understood. Herein, we investigated the effects and the underlying mechanisms of ANG II on macrophage efferocytosis in advanced atherosclerosis. ANG II decreased the surface expression of Mer  kinase (MerTK) in macrophages through a disintegrin and metalloproteinase17 (ADAM17)-mediated shedding of the soluble form of MerTK (sMer) in the medium, which led to efferocytosis suppression. ANG II-activated ADAM17 required reactive  species (ROS) and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ATR) blocker losartan suppressed ROS production, and ROS scavenger -acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) prevented p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In addition, mutant MERTK was resistant to ANG II-induced MerTK shedding and efferocytosis suppression. The advanced atherosclerosis model that is characterized by larger necrotic cores, and less collagen content was established by feeding apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE) mice with a high-fat diet for 16 wk. NAC and losartan oral administration prevented atherosclerotic lesion progression. Meanwhile, the inefficient efferocytosis represented by decreased macrophage-associated apoptotic cells and decreased MerTKCD68double-positive macrophages in advanced atherosclerosis were prevented by losartan and NAC. Additionally, the serum levels of sMer were increased and positively correlated with the upregulated levels of ANG II in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. In conclusion, ANG II promotes MerTK shedding via ATR/ROS/p38 MAPK/ADAM17 pathway in macrophages, which led to defective efferocytosis and atherosclerosis progression. Defining the molecular mechanisms of defective efferocytosis may provide a promising prognosis and therapy for ACS patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309353>Pharmacological preconditioning with phosphodiestrase inhibitor: an answer to stem cell survival against ischemic injury through JAK/STAT signaling.</a></h1><p>Stem cell transplantation in regenerative medicine has been widely used in various disorders including cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and emerging next-generation therapy. However, transplanted stem cell encountered ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury which is a major challenge for stem cell survival. During the acute phase after myocardial infarction (MI) cytokine-rich hostile microenvironment, extensive immune cell infiltration and lack of  have been a bottleneck in cell-based therapy. During prolonged ischemia, intracellular pH and ATP level decrease results in anaerobic metabolism and lactate accumulation. Consequentially, ATPase-dependent ion transport becomes dysfunctional, contributing to calcium overload and cell death by apoptosis and necrosis. Although O level revitalizes upon reperfusion, a surge in the generation of reactive  species (ROS) occurs with neutrophil infiltration in ischemic tissues further aggravating the injury. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) of stem cells with a repeated short cycle of IR results in the release of chemical signals such as NO, ROS, and adenosine which triggers a cascade of signaling events that activates protein kinase C (PKC), Src protein  kinases, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and subsequently increased synthesis of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Heme oxygenase-1 [HO-1], aldose reductase, Mn superoxide dismutase, and anti-apoptotic genes (Mcl-1, BCl-x, c-FLIP, c-FLIP). Pharmacological preconditioning uses a phosphodiestrase inhibitor, another mode of protecting stem cell or heart per se from impending ischemic injury in two phases. During the early phase of cardioprotection (2 h), PC leads to increased expression of survival factors like BCl/Bax ratio while late phase (24 h) showed activation of the JAK/STAT survival pathway. Phosphorylation of STAT3 at two crucial residues, Tyr-705 and Ser-727, allows its entry inside the nucleus and upregulates the expression of protein kinase G-1 (PKG1) which evokes cardioprotective signaling. To confirm, heart-specific conditional STAT3 knockout mice undergone IR surgery, abolishing late-phase cardioprotective effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488358>Novel promising 4-anilinoquinazoline-based derivatives as multi-target RTKs inhibitors: Design, molecular docking, synthesis, and antitumor activities in vitro and vivo.</a></h1><p>4-Anilinoquinazoline derivatives function as  kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Novel TKIs are needed for cancer mutations and drug-resistant cells. We designed and synthesized 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives with substitutions at quinazoline positions 6, 7 and 4 using a binding model with multi-target receptor  kinases, and assessed their antitumor activity against five human tumor cell lines (HepG2, A549, MCF-7, DU145, SH-SY5Y). The majority of the compounds inhibited the proliferation of all the cancer cell types, with some compounds displaying selective inhibition. Compounds 21, 25, 27, and 37 displayed IC values of 7.588, 8.619, 6.936, and 8.516 μM, respectively, for A549 cells, which were much lower than that of Gefitinib (14.803 μM). Compound 32 displayed an IC value of 2.756 μM for DU145 cells. The representative compound 40 had unexceptionable broad-spectrum inhibition for all cancer cell types, and demonstrate inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR-β), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with IC values of 46.4, 673.6 and 384.8 nM, respectively, which were similar to those of Sorafenib for VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-β (140.6 and 582.7 nM, respectively). Molecular docking results supported the molecular level assay results. Data for production of reactive  species and assessment of matrix metalloproteinase corroborated the strong anti-proliferative effect of compound 40. The compound also displayed robust antitumor efficacy and relativity lower toxicity in a xenograft model. These attributes were similar to those of Sorafenib. Compound 40 drug warrants further study as a candidate.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Key players in vessel wall degeneration are reactive  species (ROS), smooth muscle cell apoptosis, and extracellular matrix degeneration by matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Lipocalin-2, also neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), is suggested to be involved in these degenerative processes in other cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to further investigate the role of NGAL in AAA development and rupture.In this observational study, aneurysm tissue and blood of ruptured (n = 13) AAA patients were investigated versus nonruptured (n = 26) patients. Nondilated aortas (n = 5) from deceased patients and venous blood from healthy volunteers (n = 10) served as controls. NGAL concentrations in tissue and blood were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence microscopy. Nitrotyrosine (marker of ROS), MMP-9, and caspase-3 (marker of apoptosis) in aneurysm tissue were measured by immunofluorescence microscopy. AAA expansion rates were calculated retrospectively.NGAL (in μg/mL) blood concentration in ruptured AAA was 46 (range 22-122) vs. 26 (range 6-55) in nonruptured AAA (P < 0.01) and 14 (range 12-22) in controls (P < 0.01). In the aneurysm wall of ruptured AAA, NGAL concentration was 4.7 (range 1.4-25) vs. 4.4 (range 0.2-14) in nonruptured AAA (not significant) and 1.8 (range 1.2-2.7) in nondilated aortas (P = 0.04). In the medial layer, NGAL correlated positively with nitrotyrosine (Rs = 0.80, P < 0.01), MMP-9 (Rs = 0.56, P = 0.02), and caspase-3 (Rs = 0.75, P = 0.01). NGAL did not correlate to AAA expansion rate in blood or tissue (P = 0.34 and P = 0.95, respectively).This study demonstrates that NGAL blood concentration is higher in ruptured AAA patients than in nonruptured AAA. NGAL expression in the AAA wall is also higher than in nondilated aorta. Furthermore, its expression is associated with factors of vessel wall deterioration. Based on our study results, we could not determine NGAL as a biomarker for AAA growth or rupture. However, our findings do support a potential role of NGAL in the development of AAA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The obtained complexes (1-4) were characterized by analytical, IR, absorption and H NMR spectroscopic studies. The structures of ligand [H-3MSal-etsc] (HL) and complex [RuCp(Msal-etsc) (PPh)] (3), were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The interaction of the ruthenium(II) complexes (1-4) with calfthymus DNA (CT-DNA) has been explored by absorption and emission titration methods. Based on the observations, an intercalative binding mode of DNA has been proposed. The protein binding abilities of the new complexes were monitored by quenching the tryptophan and  residues of BSA, as model protein. From the studies, it was found that the new ruthenium metallacycles exhibited better affinity than their precursors. The free radical scavenging assay suggests that all complexes effectively scavenged the DPPH radicals as compared to that of standard control ascorbic acid and scavenging activities of complexes are in the order of 4 > 2 > 3 > 1. In addition, ruthenium(II) complexes (2-4) also exhibited an excellent in vivo antioxidant activity as it was able to increase the survival of worms exposed to lethal oxidative and thermal stresses possibly through reducing the intracellular ROS levels. It was interesting to note that complexes 2-4 failed to increase the lifespan of mev-1 mutant worms having shortened lifespan due to the over production of free radicals. This data confirmed that complexes 2-4 conferred stress resistance in C. elegans, but they also require an endogenous detoxification mechanism for doing so. The genetic and reporter gene expression analysis revealed that complexes 2-4 maintained the intracellular redox status and offered stress protection through transactivation of antioxidant defence machinery genes gst-4 and sod-3 which are directly regulated by SKN-1 and DAF-16 transcription factors, respectively. Altogether, our results suggested that complexes 2-4 might play a crucial role in stress modulation and they perhaps exert almost similar effects in higher models, which is an important issue to be validated in future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The AOX pathway plays an important role in stress tolerance and is induced by various metabolites and signals. Previously, several lines of evidence indicated that the AOX pathway prevents overproduction of superoxide and other reactive  species. More recent evidence suggests that AOX also plays a role in regulation of nitric oxide (NO) production and signalling. The AOX pathway is induced under low phosphate, hypoxia, pathogen infections, and elicitor treatments. The induction of AOX under aerobic conditions in response to various stresses can reduce electron transfer through complexes III and IV and thus prevents the leakage of electrons to nitrite and the subsequent accumulation of NO. Excess NO under various stresses can inhibit complex IV; thus, the AOX pathway minimizes nitrite-dependent NO synthesis that would arise from enhanced electron leakage in the cytochrome pathway. By preventing NO generation, AOX can reduce peroxynitrite formation and  nitration. In contrast to its function under normoxia, AOX has a specific role under hypoxia, where AOX can facilitate nitrite-dependent NO production. This reaction drives the phytoglobin-NO cycle to increase energy efficiency under hypoxia.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Experimental Biology.

Although abusive potential of MPA was recognized, little is known about the neurotoxic potential of MPA up to now. We investigated whether MPA induces dopaminergic neurotoxicity, and whether MPA activates a specific dopamine receptor. Here, we observed that treatment with MPA resulted in dopaminergic neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. MPA treatment potentiated oxidative parameters (i.e., increases in the level of reactive  species, 4-hydroxynonenal, and protein carbonyl), M1 phenotype-related microglial activity, and pro-apoptotic property (i.e., increases in Bax- and cleaved caspase-3-expressions, while a decrease in Bcl-2-expression). Moreover, treatment with MPA resulted in significant impairments in dopaminergic parameters [i.e., changes in dopamine level, dopamine turnover rate,  hydroxylase (TH) levels, dopamine transporter (DAT) expression, and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) expression], and in behavioral deficits. Both dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 and D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride protected from these neurotoxic consequences. Therefore, our results suggest that dopamine D1 and D2 receptors simultaneously mediate MPA-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in mice via oxidative burdens, microgliosis, and pro-apoptosis.Copyright © 2019.

Here, time-resolved x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) was used to observe the process of  formation in real time. These experiments reveal that the  evolution step, initiated by three sequential laser flashes, is accompanied by rapid (within 50 μs) changes to the Mn Kβ XES spectrum. However, no oxidation of the MnCa core above the all MnIV state was detected to precede O-O bond formation, and the observed changes were therefore assigned to O-O bond formation dynamics. We propose that O-O bond formation occurs prior to the transfer of the final (4th) electron from the MnCa cluster to the oxidized  Y residue. This model resolves the kinetic limitations associated with O-O bond formation, and suggests an evolutionary adaptation to avoid releasing of harmful peroxide species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040304>A new role for RU486 (mifepristone): it protects sperm from premature capacitation during cryopreservation in buffalo.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism by which RU 486 (mifepristone) protects sperm to undergo premature capacitation during cryopreservation. For this, semen ejaculate (n = 20) was divided into four equal fractions and diluted using egg yolk-based extender supplemented with different concentrations of RU 486 (0, 5, 10 and 20 µM) and cryopreserved. We found that RU 486 did not impair the post-thaw sperm kinetics and motility but prevented cholesterol efflux, calcium influx, and protected CatSper channels during cryopreservation. The RU 486 protected sperm from premature capacitation which was confirmed by intracellular calcium level, expression of  phosphorylated proteins (75 and 80 kDa) and CTC (chlortetracycline) assay. Furthermore, antioxidant ability of RU 486 was reflected by the ferric reducing ability, lower production of sperm malondialdehyde and intracellular reactive  species. Also, we demonstrated that RU 486 treated sperm underwent normal capacitation, zona pellucida binding and zygote cleavage indicating normal fertilizing ability of sperm. In conclusion, we report a new role of RU 486 in protecting buffalo sperm from premature capacitation during cryopreservation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608899>Anti-Colorectal Cancer Mechanisms of Formononetin Identified by Network Pharmacological Approach.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND The network pharmacological approach was used to identity the anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) targets of formononetin (FN) and the molecular mechanisms of FN against CRC. MATERIAL AND METHODS A tool of the DisGeNET database was used for collection of CRC-based targets. Other tools of SuperPred, herbal ingredients target (HIT), and SwissTargetPrediction databases were applied in prediction of pharmacological targets of FN against cancer. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of FN against CRC was obtained by using a STRING database. All top biological functional processes and signaling pathways of FN against CRC were identified by using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) software and Omicshare cloud platform. RESULTS The most key anti-CRC targets of FN were identified as tumor protein p53 (TP53), cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Erb-B2 receptor  kinase 2 (ERBB2), and cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1). In further assays, the treatment of CRC by FN was mainly involved in biological functional processes of reactive  species metabolic process, positive regulation of transcription, DNA-templated, positive regulation of nucleic acid-templated transcription, and positive regulation of RNA metabolic process. anti-CRC by FN of signaling pathways were associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), allograft rejection, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, asthma, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, and others. CONCLUSIONS The anti-CRC molecular mechanisms of FN are implicated in suppression of cellular proliferation and regulation of cancer-related metabolic pathways. Interestingly, 8 optimal biological targets may be used as potential molecular markers for predicting and treating CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469560>Indole-Diterpenoids with Protein  Phosphatase Inhibitory Activities from the Marine-Derived Fungus  sp.

We previously demonstrated that H O -induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and excessive NO production contribute to vascular cell injury and increases in microvessel permeability. However, the mechanisms of excessive NO-mediated vascular injury and hyperpermeability remain unknown. This study aims to examine the functional role of NO-derived peroxynitrite (ONOO ) in H O -induced vascular barrier dysfunction by elucidating the interrelationships between H O -induced NO, superoxide, ONOO , and changes in endothelial [Ca ] and microvessel permeability. Experiments were conducted on intact rat mesenteric venules. Microvessel permeability was determined by measuring hydraulic conductivity (Lp). Endothelial [Ca ] , NO, and O  were assessed with fluorescence imaging. Perfusion of vessels with H O (10 µmol/L) induced marked productions of NO and O  , resulting in extensive protein  nitration, a biomarker of ONOO . The formation of ONOO was abolished by inhibition of NOS with N -Methyl-L-arginine. Blocking NO production or scavenging ONOO by uric acid prevented H O -induced increases in endothelial [Ca ] and Lp. Additionally, the application of exogenous ONOO to microvessels induced delayed and progressive increases in endothelial [Ca ] and microvessel Lp, a pattern similar to that observed in H O -perfused vessels. Importantly, ONOO caused further activation of eNOS with amplified NO production. We conclude that the augmentation of NO-derived ONOO is essential for H O -induced endothelial Ca overload and progressively increased microvessel permeability, which is achieved by self-promoted amplifications of NO-dependent signaling cascades. This novel mechanism provides new insight into the reactive  and/or reactive nitrogen species-mediated vascular dysfunction in cardiovascular diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), constitutively active in many GBM tumors, plays a major role in GBM tumor growth and represents a potential therapeutic target. We have previously documented that phospho-valproic acid (MDC-1112), which inhibits STAT3 activation, possesses strong anticancer properties in multiple cancer types. In this study, we explored the anticancer efficacy of MDC-1112 in preclinical models of GBM, and evaluated its mode of action. MDC-1112 inhibited the growth of multiple human GBM cell lines in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Normal human astrocytes were resistant to MDC-1112, indicating selectivity. In vivo, MDC-1112 reduced the growth of subcutaneous GBM xenografts in mice by up to 78.2% (p<0.01), compared to the controls. Moreover, MDC-1112 extended survival in an intracranial xenograft model. While all vehicle-treated mice died by 19 days of treatment, 7 out of 11 MDC-1112-treated mice were alive and healthy by the end of 5 weeks, with many showing tumor regression. Mechanistically, MDC-1112 inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at the serine 727 residue, but not at  705, in vitro and in vivo. STAT3 overexpression rescued GBM cells from the cell growth inhibition by MDC-1112. In addition, MDC-1112 reduced STAT3 levels in the mitochondria and enhanced mitochondrial levels of reactive  species, which triggered apoptosis. In conclusion, MDC-1112 displays strong efficacy in preclinical models of GBM, with the serine 727 residue of STAT3 being its key molecular target. MDC-1112 merits further evaluation as a drug candidate for GBM.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Here we describe the heterologous expression of LAAO4 from the fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum without signal sequence as fusion protein with a 6His tag in Escherichia coli and its purification. 6His-hcLAAO4 could be activated by exposure to acidic pH, the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate, or freezing. The enzyme converted 14 proteinogenic L-amino acids with L-glutamine, L-leucine, L-methionine, L-phenylalanine, , and L-lysine being the best substrates. Methyl esters of these L-amino acids were also accepted. Even ethyl esters were converted but with lower activity. K values were below 1 mM and v values between 19 and 39 U mg for the best substrates with the acid-activated enzyme. The information for an N-terminal aldehyde tag was added to the coding sequence. Co-expressed formylglycine-generating enzyme was used to convert a cysteine residue in the aldehyde tag to a C-formylglycine residue. The aldehyde tag did not change the properties of the enzyme.

We have established a reactive sulfur metabolomics analysis by using RSS metabolic profiling, which revealed appreciable amounts of RSS generated endogenously and ubiquitously in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The chemical nature of these polysulfides is not fully understood, however, because of their reactive or complicated redox-active properties. In our study here, we determined that  and a hydroxyphenyl-containing derivative, β-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl iodoacetamide (HPE-IAM), had potent stabilizing effects on diverse polysulfide residues formed in CysSSH-related low-molecular-weight species, e.g., glutathione polysulfides (oxidized glutathione trisulfide and oxidized glutathione tetrasulfide). The protective effect against degradation was likely caused by the inhibitory activity of hydroxyphenyl residues of  and HPE-IAM against alkaline hydrolysis of polysulfides. This hydrolysis occurred via heterolytic scission triggered by the hydroxyl anion acting on polysulfides that are cleaved into thiolates and sulfenic acids, with the hydrolysis being enhanced by alkylating reagents (e.g. IAM) and dimedone. Moreover,  prevented electrophilic degradation occurring in alkaline pH. The polysulfide stabilization induced by  or the hydroxyphenyl moiety of HPE-IAM will greatly improve our understanding of the chemical properties of polysulfides and may benefit the sulfur metabolomics analysis if it can be applied successfully to any kind of biological samples, including clinical specimens.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the impacts of serum electrolytes on ROS-associated damage has received little attention. We demonstrate that the conversion of OH to carbonate and halogen radicals via reactions with serum-relevant carbonate and halide concentrations fundamentally alters the targeting of amino acids and loss of enzymatic activity in catalase, albumin and carbonic anhydrase, three important blood proteins. Chemical kinetic modeling indicated that carbonate and halogen radical concentrations should exceed OH concentrations by 6 and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively. Steady-state γ-radiolysis experiments demonstrated that serum-level carbonates and halides increased , tryptophan and enzymatic activity losses in catalase up to 6-fold. These outcomes were specific to carbonates and halides, not general ionic strength effects. Serum carbonates and halides increased the degradation of tyrosines and methionines in albumin, and increased the degradation of histidines while decreasing enzymatic activity loss in carbonic anhydrase. Serum electrolytes increased the degradation of tyrosines, tryptophans and enzymatic activity in the model enzyme, ketosteroid isomerase, predominantly due to carbonate radical reactions. Treatment of a mutant ketosteroid isomerase indicated that preferential targeting of the active site  accounted for half of the total  loss. The results suggest that carbonate and halogen radicals may be more significant than OH as drivers for protein degradation in serum. Accounting for the selective targeting of biomolecules by these daughter radicals is important for developing a mechanistic understanding of the consequences of oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The potential of urea as a chaotropic agent to enhance the solubilization of biofilm proteins has been reported briefly in the literature. In this paper the efficiency of urea cleaning for RO membrane systems has been compared to conventionally applied acid/alkali treatment. Preliminary assessment confirmed that urea did not damage the RO polyamide membranes and that the membrane cleaning efficiency increased with increasing concentrations of urea and temperature. Accelerated biofilm formation was carried out in membrane fouling simulators which were subsequently cleaned with (i) 0.01M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 0.1M hydrochloric acid (HCl) (typically applied in industry), (ii) urea (CO(NH)) and hydrochloric acid, or (iii) urea only (1340 g/L). The pressure drop over the flow channel was used to evaluate the efficiency of the applied chemical cleanings. Biomass removal was evaluated by measuring chemical  demand (COD), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), protein, and carbohydrate content from the membrane and spacer surfaces after cleaning. In addition to protein and carbohydrate quantification of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (FEEM) spectroscopy was used to distinguish the difference in organic matter of the remaining biomass to assess biofilm solubilization efficacy of the different cleaning agents. Results indicated that two-stage CO(NH)/HCl cleaning was as effective as cleaning with NaOH/HCl in terms of restoring the feed channel pressure drop (>70% pressure drop decrease). One-stage cleaning with urea only was not as effective indicating the importance of the second-stage low pH acid cleaning in weakening the biofilm matrix. All three chemical cleaning protocols were equally effective in reducing the concentration of predominant EPS components protein and carbohydrate (>50% reduction in concentrations). However, urea-based cleaning strategies were more effective in solubilizing protein-like matter and -containing proteins. Furthermore, ATP measurements showed that biomass inactivation was up to two-fold greater after treatment with urea-based chemical cleanings compared to the conventional acid/alkali treatment. The applicability of urea as an alternative, economical, eco-friendly and effective chemical cleaning agent for the control of biological fouling was successfully demonstrated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31059085>Astaxanthin inhibits homocysteine‑induced endothelial cell dysfunction via the regulation of the reactive  species‑dependent VEGF‑VEGFR2‑FAK signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Increased plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) can cause severe damage to vascular endothelial cells. Hcy‑induced endothelial cell dysfunction contributes to the occurrence and development of human cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs). Our previous studies have revealed that astaxanthin (ATX) exhibits novel cardioprotective activity against Hcy‑induced cardiotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. However, the protective effect and mechanism of ATX against Hcy‑induced endothelial cell dysfunction requires further investigation. In the present study, treatment of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) with Hcy inhibited the migration, invasive and tube formation potentials of these cells in a dose‑dependent manner. Hcy treatment further induced a time‑dependent increase in the production of reactive  species (ROS), and downregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), phosphorylated (p)‑Tyr‑VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and p‑Tyr397‑focal adhesion kinase (FAK). On the contrary, ATX pre‑treatment significantly inhibited Hcy‑induced cytotoxicity and increased HUVEC migration, invasion and tube formation following Hcy treatment. The mechanism of action may involve the effective inhibition of Hcy‑induced ROS generation and the recovery of FAK phosphorylation. Collectively, our findings suggested that ATX could inhibit Hcy‑induced endothelial dysfunction by suppressing Hcy‑induced activation of the VEGF‑VEGFR2‑FAK signaling axis, which indicates the novel therapeutic potential of ATX in treating Hcy‑mediated CVD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171721>Peroxynitrite supports a metabolic reprogramming in merlin-deficient Schwann cells and promotes cell survival.</a></h1><p>Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The  gene encodes the tumor suppressor merlin, and loss of merlin activity promotes tumorigenesis and causes NF2. Cellular redox signaling has been implicated in different stages of tumor development. Among reactive nitrogen species, peroxynitrite is the most powerful oxidant produced by cells. We recently showed that peroxynitrite-mediated  nitration down-regulates mitochondrial metabolism in tumor cells. However, whether peroxynitrite supports a metabolic shift that could be exploited for therapeutic development is unknown. Here, we show that vestibular schwannomas from NF2 patients and human, merlin-deficient (MD) Schwann cells have high levels of endogenous  nitration, indicating production of peroxynitrite. Furthermore, scavenging or inhibiting peroxynitrite formation significantly and selectively decreased survival of human and mouse MD-Schwann cells. Using multiple complementary methods, we also found that merlin deficiency leads to a reprogramming of energy metabolism characterized by a peroxynitrite-dependent decrease of oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolysis and glutaminolysis. In MD-Schwann cells, scavenging of peroxynitrite increased mitochondrial  consumption and membrane potential, mediated by the up-regulation of the levels and activity of mitochondrial complex IV. This increase in mitochondrial activity correlated with a decrease in the glycolytic rate and glutamine dependence. This is the first demonstration of a peroxynitrite-dependent reprogramming of energy metabolism in tumor cells. Oxidized proteins constitute a novel target for therapeutic development not only for the treatment of NF2 schwannomas but also other tumors in which peroxynitrite plays a regulatory role.© 2019 Pestoni et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152846>The cystine/glutamate antiporter xCT is a key regulator of EphA2 S897 phosphorylation under glucose-limited conditions.</a></h1><p>EphA2, which belongs to the Eph family of receptor  kinases, is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers.

Our results suggest a role of EphA2 in glioblastoma cell viability under glucose-limited conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It was proposed that a recently discovered subclass of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), class Id, is dependent on a Mn(IV,III) cofactor for catalysis. Class I RNRs consist of a substrate-binding component (NrdA) and a metal-containing radical-generating component (NrdB). Herein we utilize a combination of EPR spectroscopy and enzyme assays to underscore the enzymatic relevance of the Mn(IV,III) cofactor in class Id NrdB from Facklamia ignava. Once formed, the Mn(IV,III) cofactor confers enzyme activity that correlates well with cofactor quantity. Moreover, we present the X-ray structure of the apo- and aerobically Mn-loaded forms of the homologous class Id NrdB from Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis, revealing a dimanganese centre typical of the subclass, with a  residue maintained at distance from the metal centre and a lysine residue projected towards the metals. Structural comparison of the apo- and metal-loaded forms of the protein reveals a refolding of the loop containing the conserved lysine and an unusual shift in the orientation of helices within a monomer, leading to the opening of a channel towards the metal site. Such major conformational changes have not been observed in NrdB proteins before. Finally, in vitro reconstitution experiments reveal that the high-valent manganese cofactor is not formed spontaneously from , but can be generated from at least two different reduced  species, i.e. HO and superoxide (O   ). Considering the observed differences in the efficiency of these two activating reagents, we propose that the physiologically relevant mechanism involves superoxide.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076662>Engineering proteins for allosteric control by light or ligands.</a></h1><p>Control of protein activity in living cells can reveal the role of spatiotemporal dynamics in signaling circuits. Protein analogs with engineered allosteric responses can be particularly effective in the interrogation of protein signaling, as they can replace endogenous proteins with minimal perturbation of native interactions. However, it has been a challenge to identify allosteric sites in target proteins where insertion of responsive domains produces an allosteric response comparable to the activity of native proteins. Here, we describe a detailed protocol to generate genetically encoded analogs of proteins that can be allosterically controlled by either rapamycin or blue light, as well as experimental procedures to produce and test these analogs in vitro and in mammalian cell lines. We describe computational methods, based on crystal structures or homology models, to identify effective sites for insertion of either an engineered rapamycin-responsive (uniRapR) domain or the light-responsive light--voltage 2 (LOV2) domain. The inserted domains allosterically regulate the active site, responding to rapamycin with irreversible activation, or to light with reversible inactivation at higher spatial and temporal resolution. These strategies have been successfully applied to catalytic domains of protein kinases, Rho family GTPases, and guanine exchange factors (GEFs), as well as the binding domain of a GEF Vav2. Computational tasks can be completed within a few hours, followed by 1-2 weeks of experimental validation. We provide protocols for computational design, cloning, and experimental testing of the engineered proteins, using Src  kinase, GEF Vav2, and Rho GTPase Rac1 as examples.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661838>Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 3 is Critical for α-Synuclein Uptake and MPP-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Cultured Dopaminergic Neurons.</a></h1><p>α-Synuclein is an abundant neuronal protein that accumulates in insoluble inclusions in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. Fatty acids partially regulate α-Synuclein accumulation, and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons highly express fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3). We previously demonstrated that FABP3 knockout mice show decreased α-Synuclein oligomerization and neuronal degeneration of  hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons . In this study, we newly investigated the importance of FABP3 in α-Synuclein uptake, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)-induced axodendritic retraction, and mitochondrial dysfunction. To disclose the issues, we employed cultured mesencephalic neurons derived from wild type or FABP3 C57BL6 mice and performed immunocytochemical analysis. We demonstrated that TH neurons from FABP3 mice take up α-Synuclein monomers while FABP3 TH neurons do not. The formation of filamentous α-Synuclein inclusions following treatment with MPP was observed only in FABP3, and not in FABP3 neurons. Notably, detailed morphological analysis revealed that FABP neurons did not exhibit MPP-induced axodendritic retraction. Moreover, FABP3 was also critical for MPP-induced reduction of mitochondrial activity and the production of reactive  species. These data indicate that FABP3 is critical for α-Synuclein uptake in dopaminergic neurons, thereby preventing synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30774884>X-ray Raman optical activity of chiral molecules.</a></h1><p>Resonant and off-resonant Raman Optical Activity signals in the X-ray regime (XROA) are predicted. XROA is a chiral-sensitive variant of the spontaneous Resonant Inelastic Scattering (RIXS) signal. Thanks to the highly localized nature of core excitations, these signals provide a direct probe of local chirality with high sensitivity to the molecular structure. We derive sum-over-states expressions for frequency domain XROA signals and apply them to  at the nitrogen and  K-edges.

The condition is associated with several other autoimmune diseases, but autoimmune thyroid diseases, especially Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), is the most prevalent organ-specific autoimmune disease with a co-morbidity up to 34%. Among the many hypotheses that have been proposed for the pathogenesis of both diseases, autoimmunity and oxidative stress-mediated toxicity in melanocytes or thyrocytes, respectively, have been the most widely accepted - with autoimmunity being the presumed consequence of oxidative stress-mediated toxicity. However, the predominant etiologic basis for impairment of redox balance has rarely been studied. The two autoimmune diseases are not only linked by a concordance of clinical presentations and an autoimmune/oxidative stress-mediated toxicity pathogenesis but also by an apparent biochemical commonality. The target molecules produced in the thyroid and skin, i.e., thyroxine and melanin, respectively, are derived from the same primordial parent molecule, . On the basis of these similarities between Hashimoto's thyroiditis and vitiligo, specifically with respect to the activation of oxidative stress, we propose a novel hypothesis accounting for the destruction of melanocytes or thyrocytes in VL and AT. We suggest a new therapeutic regimen of quinone derivatives to combat ROS-induced autoimmunity resulting from this common biochemical etiologic error.Copyright © 2019.

It has been shown that environmental exposures such as diesel exhaust and heavy metals exacerbate mast cell degranulation and activation. Today, the use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) is rapidly expanding and silver nanoparticles (AgNP) are one of the mostly widely utilized ENMs, primarily for their antimicrobial properties, and are being incorporated into many consumer and biomedical products. We assessed whether pre-exposure of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) to 20 nm AgNPs enhanced degranulation and activation to an allergen (dinitrophenol-conjugated human serum albumin) by measuring β-hexosaminidase release, LTB4 and IL-6 production. In addition, we assessed reactive  species (ROS) generation, cell oxidative stress and toxicity as well as total and individual protein  phosphorylation (p-Tyr). We found that pre-exposure of BMMCs to AgNPs results in exacerbated allergen-mediated mast cell degranulation, LTB4 production and IL-6 release. Exposure of BMMCs to AgNPs exacerbated allergen-induced ROS generation, however, this was not associated with oxidative stress nor cell death. Finally, pre-exposure to AgNPs enhanced allergen-mediated global p-Tyr as well as individual proteins including Syk, PLC and LAT. Our findings indicate that pre-exposure to AgNPs exacerbates mast cell allergen-mediated phosphorylation of FcεR1-linked  kinases and ROS generation resulting in amplified early and late-phase responses. These findings suggest that exposure to AgNPs has the potential to prime mast cells to allergic immune responses, which could be of particular concern to atopic populations as the use of AgNPs in consumer and biomedical products rapidly increases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The present study examined whether norfluoxetine (a metabolite of fluoxetine) could regulate neuroinflammation in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropypridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD and rescue dopamine neurons. Analysis by  hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry demonstrated that norfluoxetine prevents degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons  in MPTP-lesioned mice compared to vehicle-treated MPTP-lesioned control mice. MAC-1 immunostaining and hydroethidine histochemical staining showed that norfluoxetine neuroprotection is accompanied by inhibiting MPTP-induced microglial activation and activated microglia-derived reactive  species production , respectively. In the separate experiments, treatment with norfluoxetine inhibited NADPH oxidase activation and nitrate production in LPS-treated cortical microglial cultures . Collectively, these  and  results suggest that norfluoxetine could be employed as a novel therapeutic agent for treating PD, which is associated with neuroinflammation and microglia-derived oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31036643>Oxidation of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase positively regulates translational quality control.</a></h1><p>Accurate translation of the genetic code is maintained in part by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) proofreading mechanisms that ensure correct attachment of a cognate amino acid to a transfer RNA (tRNA). During environmental stress, such as oxidative stress, demands on aaRS proofreading are altered by changes in the availability of cytoplasmic amino acids. For example, oxidative stress increases levels of cytotoxic  isomers, noncognate amino acids normally excluded from translation by the proofreading activity of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS). Here we show that oxidation of PheRS induces a conformational change, generating a partially unstructured protein. This conformational change does not affect Phe or Tyr activation or the aminoacylation activity of PheRS. However, in vitro and ex vivo analyses reveal that proofreading activity to hydrolyze Tyr-tRNA is increased during oxidative stress, while the cognate Phe-tRNA aminoacylation activity is unchanged. In HPX,  that lack reactive -scavenging enzymes and accumulate intracellular HO, we found that PheRS proofreading is increased by 11%, thereby providing potential protection against hazardous cytoplasmic -Tyr accumulation. These findings show that in response to oxidative stress, PheRS proofreading is positively regulated without negative effects on the enzyme's housekeeping activity in translation. Our findings also illustrate that while the loss of quality control and mistranslation may be beneficial under some conditions, increased proofreading provides a mechanism for the cell to appropriately respond to environmental changes during oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134068>Probiotics May Have Beneficial Effects in Parkinson's Disease:  Evidence.</a></h1><p> Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons and intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein, both in the basal ganglia and in peripheral sites, such as the gut. Peripheral immune activation and reactive  species (ROS) production are important pathogenetic features of PD. In this context, the present study focused on the assessment of  effects of probiotic bacterial strains in PBMCs isolated from PD patients vs. healthy controls.  40 PD patients and 40 matched controls have been enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and co-cultured with a selection of probiotics microorganisms belonging to the  and  genus.  release of the major pro- (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha and Interleukin-17A and 6) and anti-inflammatory (Interleukin 4 and 10) cytokines by PBMCs, as well as the production of ROS was investigated. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of probiotics to influence membrane integrity, antagonize the growth of potential pathogen bacteria, such as  and  and encode  decarboxylase genes ().  All probiotic strains were able to inhibit inflammatory cytokines and ROS production in both patients and controls. The most striking results were obtained in PD subjects with  LS01 and  which significantly reduced pro-inflammatory and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokines ( < 0.05). Furthermore, most strains determined restoration of membrane integrity and inhibition of  and . Finally, we also showed that all the strains do not carry  gene, which is known to decrease levodopa bioavailability in PD patients under treatment.  Probiotics exert promising  results in decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and potentially pathogenic bacterial overgrowth.  longitudinal data are mandatory to support the use of bacteriotherapy in PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813433>A Review of the Role of Green Tea () in Antiphotoaging, Stress Resistance, Neuroprotection, and Autophagy.</a></h1><p>Tea is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, and is available in various forms. Green tea is richer in antioxidants compared to other forms of tea. Tea is composed of polyphenols, caffeine, minerals, and trace amounts of vitamins, amino acids, and carbohydrates. The composition of the tea varies depending on the fermentation process employed to produce it. The phytochemicals present in green tea are known to stimulate the central nervous system and maintain overall health in humans. Skin aging is a complex process mediated by intrinsic factors such as senescence, along with extrinsic damage induced by external factors such as chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-A process known as photoaging-Which can lead to erythema, edema, sunburn, hyperplasia, premature aging, and the development of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers. UV can cause skin damage either directly, through absorption of energy by biomolecules, or indirectly, by increased production of reactive  species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Green tea phytochemicals are a potent source of exogenous antioxidant candidates that could nullify excess endogenous ROS and RNS inside the body, and thereby diminish the impact of photoaging. Several in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that green tea supplementation increases the collagen and elastin fiber content, and suppresses collagen degrading enzyme MMP-3 production in the skin, conferring an anti-wrinkle effect. The precise mechanism behind the anti-photoaging effect of green tea has not been explored yet. Studies using the worm model have suggested that green tea mediated lifespan extension depends on the DAF-16 pathway. Apart from this, green tea has been reported to have stress resistance and neuroprotective properties. Its ROS scavenging activity makes it a potent stress mediator, as it can also regulate the stress induced by metal ions. It is known that tea polyphenols can induce the expression of different antioxidant enzymes and hinder the DNA oxidative damage. Growing evidence suggests that green tea can also be used as a potential agent to mediate neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. EGCG, an abundant catechin in tea, was found to suppress the neurotoxicity induced by Aβ as it activates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), along with inhibiting c-Abl/FE65-the cytoplasmic nonreceptor  kinase which is involved in the development of the nervous system and in nuclear translocation. Additionally, green tea polyphenols induce autophagy, thereby revitalizing the overall health of the organism consuming it. Green tea was able to activate autophagy in HL-60 xenographs by increasing the activity of PI3 kinase and BECLIN-1.

In contrast to lower S-states (S, S), in higher S-states (S, S) of the MnCaO cluster, Y cannot be oxidized at cryogenic temperatures due to the accumulation of positive charge in the S → S transition. However, oxidation of Y by illumination of S at 77-190 K followed by rapid freezing and charge recombination between Y and the plastoquinone radical Q allows trapping of an S variant, the so-called S state (S), that is capable of forming Y at cryogenic temperature. To identify the differences between the S and S states, we used the SY intermediate as a probe for the S state and followed the SY/Q recombination kinetics at 10 K using time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in HO and DO. The results show that while SY/Q recombination can be described as pure electron transfer occurring in the Marcus inverted region, the S → S reversion depends on proton rearrangement and exhibits a strong kinetic isotope effect. This suggests that Y oxidation in the S state is facilitated by favorable proton redistribution in the vicinity of Y, most likely within the hydrogen-bonded Y-His190-Asn298 triad. Computational models show that tautomerization of Asn298 to its imidic acid form enables proton translocation to an adjacent asparagine-rich cavity of water molecules that functions as a proton reservoir and can further participate in proton egress to the lumen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550527>Resveratrol suppresses neutrophil activation via inhibition of Src family kinases to attenuate lung injury.</a></h1><p>The natural stilbenoid, Resveratrol (RSV; 3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) has been shown to have beneficial effects on inflammatory diseases as well as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular disorders. The underlying mechanism by which RSV affects neutrophil activation has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that RSV modulates the inflammatory activities of formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-stimulated human neutrophils. We employed a well-established isolated-neutrophil model to investigate the effects of RSV on neutrophil functions and the underlying mechanism of signaling transduction. The lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI murine model was employed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of RSV. Experiment results demonstrate that RSV reduces respiratory burst, degranulation, integrin expression, and cell adhesion in activated neutrophils in dose-dependent manners. RSV inhibited phosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFKs) and reduced their enzymatic activities. Moreover, RSV and a selective inhibitor of SFKs (PP2) reduced the phosphorylation of Bruton's  kinase and Vav. There results indicated that the inhibitory effects of RSV are mediated through the inhibition of the SFKs-Btk-Vav pathway. This study also revealed that RSV attenuates endotoxin-induced lung injury. We surmise that the therapeutic effects of RSV on ALI may derive from its anti-neutrophilic inflammation function and free radical-scavenging effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It induces on human neuronal cell cultures a dose dependent toxicity associated with increased reactive  species production. Since glial cells play a key role in assisting neuronal function, here we investigated the effects of increased concentrations of 24S-OHC on a glial cell model (human glioblastoma U-87 MG cells). We determined the content of PGC-1α and TFAM, involved in the biogenesis of mitochondria, both mitochondrial complexes activity and protein amount, lipid and protein oxidative damage, cellular reactive  species (ROS) release and both the activities and amount of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and catalase. Low concentration of 24S-OHC increased cellular content of PGC-1α and TFAM and the activities of mitochondrial complexes I and II, with no marked changes in their protein amount. Interestingly, 24S-OHC at lower concentrations reduced while at higher concentration increased lipid and protein oxidative damage. Conversely, the content of nitro- increased only with the highest 24S-OHC concentration. Also, cell HO release was reduced by lower and increased by higher 24S-OHC used concentrations. The cell activity of glutathione peroxidase was reduced by 24S-OHC at higher concentration while that of catalase was reduced by all the assayed concentrations. Further, a dose dependent decrease of both enzymes levels was observed. In conclusion, we demonstrated that 24S-OHC exerts different effects on U-87 MG cells depending on its level. At lower concentrations it stimulates cellular processes critical to maintain redox homeostasis, while at higher dose its effect on the glial cell here used resemble its action on neurons.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies show that PTHrP-induced hypertrophic response in mesangial cells (MCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tubuloepithelial cells can be mediated by TGF-β1. In the present study, although long-term PHTrP (1-34) treatment increased the mRNA and protein level of TGF-β1 in primary rat MCs, fibronectin up-regulation occurred earlier, suggesting that fibronectin induction is independent of TGF-β1/Smad signaling. We thus evaluated the involvement of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and found that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-derived reactive  species mediates PTHrP (1-34)-induced Src kinase activation. Src phosphorylates EGFR at  845 and then transactive EGFR. Subsequent PI3K activation mediates Akt and ERK1/2 activation. Akt and ERK1/2 discretely lead to excessive protein synthesis of fibronectin. Our study thus demonstrates the new role of PTHrP in fibronectin up-regulation for the first time in glomerular MCs. These data also provided new insights to guide development of therapy for glomerular sclerosis.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117657>Hydrogen Donation but not Abstraction by a  (Y68) during Endoperoxide Installation by Verruculogen Synthase (FtmOx1).</a></h1><p>Hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) from a substrate carbon to an iron(IV)-oxo (ferryl) intermediate initiates a diverse array of enzymatic transformations. For outcomes other than hydroxylation, coupling of the resultant carbon radical and hydroxo ligand ( rebound) must generally be averted. A recent study of FtmOx1, a fungal iron(II)- and 2-(oxo)glutarate-dependent oxygenase that installs the endoperoxide of verruculogen by adding O between carbons 21 and 27 of fumitremorgin B, posited that  (Tyr or Y) 224 serves as HAT intermediary to separate the C21 radical (C21•) and Fe(III)-OH HAT products and prevent rebound. Our reinvestigation of the FtmOx1 mechanism revealed, instead, direct HAT from C21 to the ferryl complex and surprisingly competitive rebound. The C21-hydroxylated (rebound) product, which undergoes deprenylation, predominates when low [O] slows C21•-O coupling in the next step of the endoperoxidation pathway. This pathway culminates with addition of the C21-O-O• peroxyl adduct to olefinic C27 followed by HAT to the C26• from a Tyr. The last step results in sequential accumulation of Tyr radicals, which are suppressed without detriment to turnover by inclusion of the reductant, ascorbate. Replacement of each of four candidates for the proximal C26 H• donor (including Y224) with phenylalanine (F) revealed that only the Y68F variant (i) fails to accumulate the first Tyr• and (ii) makes an altered major product, identifying Y68 as the donor. The implied proximities of C21 to the iron cofactor and C26 to Y68 support a new docking model of the enzyme-substrate complex that is consistent with all available data.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31274599>Lipid Emulsion Containing High Amounts of n3 Fatty Acids (Omegaven) as Opposed to n6 Fatty Acids (Intralipid) Preserves Insulin Signaling and Glucose Uptake in Perfused Rat Hearts.</a></h1><p>It is currently unknown whether acute exposure to n3 fatty acid-containing fish oil-based lipid emulsion Omegaven as opposed to the n6 fatty acid-containing soybean oil-based lipid emulsion Intralipid is more favorable in terms of insulin signaling and glucose uptake in the intact beating heart.Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were perfused in the working mode for 90 minutes in the presence of 11 mM glucose and 1.2 mM palmitate bound to albumin, the first 30 minutes without insulin followed by 60 minutes with insulin (50 mU/L). Hearts were randomly allocated to 100 µM Intralipid, 100 µM Omegaven, or no emulsion (insulin treatment alone) for 60 minutes. Glycolysis and glycogen synthesis were measured with the radioactive tracer [5-H]glucose, and glucose uptake was calculated. Phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), protein kinase Akt, and phosphofructokinase (PFK)-2 was measured by immunoblotting. Glycolytic metabolites were determined by enzymatic assays. Mass spectrometry was used to establish acylcarnitine profiles. Nuclear factor κB (NFκB) nuclear translocation served as reactive  species (ROS) biosensor.Insulin-mediated glucose uptake was decreased by Intralipid (4.9 ± 0.4 vs 3.7 ± 0.3 μmol/gram dry heart weight [gdw]·min; P = .047) due to both reduced glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. In contrast, Omegaven treatment did not affect insulin-mediated glycolysis or glycogen synthesis and thus preserved glucose uptake (5.1 ± 0.3 vs 4.9 ± 0.4 μmol/gdw·min; P = .94). While Intralipid did not affect PP2A phosphorylation status, Omegaven resulted in significantly enhanced  phosphorylation and inhibition of PP2A. This was accompanied by increased selective threonine phosphorylation of Akt and the downstream target PFK-2 at S483. PFK-1 activity was increased when compared with Intralipid as measured by the ratio of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate (Omegaven 0.60 ± 0.11 versus Intralipid 0.47 ± 0.09; P = .023), consistent with increased formation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate by PFK2, its main allosteric activator. Omegaven lead to accumulation of acylcarnitines and fostered a prooxidant response as evidenced by NFκB nuclear translocation and activation.Omegaven as opposed to Intralipid preserves glucose uptake via the PP2A-Akt-PFK pathway in intact beating hearts. n3 fatty acids decelerate β-oxidation causing accumulation of acylcarnitine species and a prooxidant response, which likely inhibits redox-sensitive PP2A and thus preserves insulin signaling and glucose uptake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31097679> nitrations impaired intracellular trafficking of FSHR to the cell surface and FSH-induced Akt-FoxO3a signaling in human granulosa cells.</a></h1><p>Many infertile women suffered from poor ovarian response, and increased reactive  species with age might mediate the poor ovarian response to FSH.

Increased levels of peroxynitrite,  nitrations of FSH receptor (FSHR) and apoptosis were obviously detectable with decreased FSHR protein expressions in granulosa cells of the poor ovarian responders. In KGN (a human ovarian granulosa cell line) cells, exogenous peroxynitrite could sequester FSHR in the cytoplasm, and these dislocated FSHR might suffer from proteasome-mediated degradations. Here, we identified four peroxynitrite-mediated nitrated  residues of FSHR. Site-directed mutagenesis of FSHR revealed that Y626 was pivotal for intracellular trafficking of FSHR to the cell surface. Akt-induced inactivation of FoxO3a was required for the repression of FSH on granulosa cell apoptosis. However, peroxynitrite impaired FSH-induced Akt-FoxO3a signaling, while FSHR-Y626A mutant took similar effects.

In an in vitro kinase profiling assay, AIU2001 inhibited the activities of FLT3, mutated FLT3, FLT4, and c-KIT of class III RTK, and the proliferation of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. AIU2001 induced DNA damage, reactive  species (ROS) generation, and cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Furthermore, AIU2001 suppressed the DNA damage repair genes, resulting in the 'BRCAness'/'DNA-PKness' phenotype.

Blue light stimulation elevated the pERK and pPLCγ1 levels in membrane-opto-FGFR1-transfected cells similarly to ligand-induced receptor activation; however, no changes in pAKT levels were observed. PC12 cells transfected with membrane-opto-FGFR1 exhibited significantly longer neurites after light stimulation than after growth factor treatment, and significantly more neurites extended from their cell bodies. The activation of cytoplasmic FGFR1 kinase enhanced ERK signaling in HEK293 cells but not in PC12 cells and did not induce neuronal differentiation. The stimulation of FGFR1 kinase in the nucleus also did not result in signaling changes or neurite outgrowth. We conclude that FGFR1 kinase needs to be associated with membranes to induce the differentiation of PC12 cells mainly via ERK activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31053160>Celastrol mediates autophagy and apoptosis via the ROS/JNK and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways in glioma cells.</a></h1><p>Celastrol, a triterpene compound derived from the traditional Chinese medicine Tripterygium wilfordii, has been reported to possess potential antitumor activity towards various malignancies. However, the effect of celastrol on glioma cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive.Glioma cells, including the U251, U87-MG and C6 cell lines and an animal model were used. The effects of celastrol on cells were evaluated by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, reactive  species production assay and immunoblotting after treatment of celastrol. Fisher's exact test, a one-way ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney U-test were used to compare differences between groups. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0 software.Here, we found that exposure to celastrol induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. Celastrol increased the formation of autophagosomes, accumulation of LC3B and the expression of p62 protein. Celastrol-treated glioma cells exhibited decreased cell viability after the use of autophagy inhibitors. Additionally, autophagy and apoptosis caused by celastrol in glioma cells inhibited each other. Furthermore, celastrol induced JNK activation and ROS production and inhibited the activities of Akt and mTOR kinases. JNK and ROS inhibitors significantly attenuated celastrol-trigged apoptosis and autophagy, while Akt and mTOR inhibitors had opposite effects.In conclusion, our study revealed that celastrol caused G2/M phase arrest and trigged apoptosis and autophagy by activating ROS/JNK signaling and blocking the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034925>The small members of the JMJD protein family: Enzymatic jewels or jinxes?</a></h1><p>Jumonji C domain-containing (JMJD) proteins are mostly epigenetic regulators that demethylate histones. However, a hitherto neglected subfamily of JMJD proteins, evolutionarily distant and characterized by their relatively small molecular weight, exerts different functions by hydroxylating proteins and RNA. Recently, unsuspected proteolytic and  kinase activities were also ascribed to some of these small JMJD proteins, further increasing their enzymatic versatility. Here, we discuss the ten human small JMJD proteins (HIF1AN, HSPBAP1, JMJD4, JMJD5, JMJD6, JMJD7, JMJD8, RIOX1, RIOX2, TYW5) and their diverse physiological functions. In particular, we focus on the roles of these small JMJD proteins in cancer and other maladies and how they are modulated in diseased cells by an altered metabolic milieu, including hypoxia, reactive  species and oncometabolites. Because small JMJD proteins are enzymes, they are amenable to inhibition by small molecules and may represent novel targets in the therapy of cancer and other diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The formation of toxic amyloid oligomers, extracellular amyloid plaques and amyloid angiopathy in brain by amyloid beta peptides are considered a part of the identified mechanism involved in disease pathogenesis. The optimal treatment approach leads toward finding a chemical compound able to form a noncovalent complex with the amyloid peptide thus blocking the process of amyloid aggregation. This direction gained an increasing interest lately, many studies demonstrating that mass spectrometry is a valuable method useful for the identification and characterization of such molecules able to interact with amyloid peptides. In the present review we aim to identify in the scientific literature low molecular weight chemical compounds for which there is mass spectrometric evidence of noncovalent complex formation with amyloid peptides and also there are toxicity reduction results which verify the effects of these compounds on amyloid beta toxicity towards cell cultures and transgenic mouse models developing Alzheimer's Disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30689497>Statistical medium optimization and DO-STAT fed-batch fermentation for enhanced production of  phenol lyase in recombinant Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p> phenol lyase (TPL) is a robust biocatalyst for the production of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). The improvement of TPL production is conducive to the industrial potential. In this study, the optimization of culture medium of recombinant Escherichia coli harboring TPL from Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn-TPL) was carried out. Sucrose and combination of yeast extract and peptone were selected as carbon and nitrogen source, respectively. Their optimal concentrations were determined by Box-Behnken design and the synergistic effect between yeast extract and peptone was found to be significant, with p-value < 0.05.

Environmental exposure to incense burning smoke is a potential risk factor for tumor development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Eastern Asia ethnic origin is strongly associated the clinical benefits of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in NSCLC patients. However, the impact of the oriental custom of incense burning on the cancer progression and the EGFR TKI-sensitivity of NSCLC remains unclear. Our results showed that long-term exposure to incense burning extract (IBE) increases the cellular proliferation with S phase accumulation and the motility activity of NSCLCs. Interestingly, IBE enhances EGFR signaling activity without affecting its genetic status, and increases the cellular sensitivity of NSCLC cell lines to EGFR TKIs. Auramine, a yellow dye for making incense sticks, was identified as a residual composition in the burning incense smoke, and showed similar EGFR TKI-sensitizing effects. Furthermore, IBE or auramine transcriptionally induce EGFR ligand amphiregulin (AREG) expression for the enhancement of EGFR activity. Neutralization of AREG reduced the viability of IBE-treated cells. These results indicated that exposure to incent smoke may enhance NSCLC progression and their sensitivity to EGFR TKIs through increasing their oncogenic addiction to AREG-induced EGFR signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539562>Nitric oxide stimulates a PKC-Src-Akt signaling axis which increases human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in human T lymphocytes.</a></h1><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are typically accompanied by high levels of secreted inflammatory cytokines and generation of high levels of reactive  species (ROS). To elucidate how HIV-1 alters the cellular redox environment during viral replication, we used human HIV-1 infected CD4T lymphocytes and uninfected cells as controls. ROS and nitric oxide (NO) generation, antioxidant enzyme activity, protein phosphorylation, and viral and proviral loads were measured at different times (2-36 h post-infection) in the presence and absence of the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). HIV-1 infection increased ROS generation and decreased intracellular NO content. Upon infection, we observed increases in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, and a marked decrease in glutathione (GSH) concentration. Exposure of HIV-1 infected CD4T lymphocytes to SNAP resulted in an increasingly oxidizing intracellular environment, associated with  nitration and SOD1 inhibition. In addition, SNAP treatment promoted phosphorylation and activation of the host's signaling proteins, PKC, Src kinase and Akt. Inhibition of PKC leads to inhibition of Src kinase strongly suggesting that PKC is the upstream element in this signaling cascade. Changes in the intracellular redox environment after SNAP treatment had an effect on HIV-1 replication as reflected by increases in proviral and viral loads. In the absence or presence of SNAP, we observed a decrease in viral load in infected CD4T lymphocytes pre-incubated with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. In conclusion, oxidative/nitrosative stress conditions derived from exposure of HIV-1-infected CD4T lymphocytes to an exogenous NO source trigger a signaling cascade involving PKC, Src kinase and Akt. Activation of this signaling cascade appears to be critical to the establishment of HIV-1 infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

As a product of water chlorination and a metabolite of certain industrial chemicals, DCA is ubiquitous in our biosphere at low μg/kg body weight daily exposure levels without obvious adverse effects in humans. As an investigational drug for numerous congenital and acquired diseases, DCA is administered orally or parenterally, usually at doses of 10-50mg/kg per day. As a therapeutic, its principal mechanism of action is to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). In turn, PDK inhibits the key mitochondrial energy homeostat, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), by reversible phosphorylation. By blocking PDK, DCA activates PDC and, consequently, the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP synthesis. A reversible sensory/motor peripheral neuropathy is the clinically limiting adverse effect of chronic DCA exposure and experimental data implicate the Schwann cell as a toxicological target. It has been postulated that stimulation of PDC and respiratory chain activity by DCA in normally glycolytic Schwann cells causes uncompensated oxidative stress from increased reactive  species production. Additionally, the metabolism of DCA interferes with the catabolism of the amino acids phenylalanine and  and with heme synthesis, resulting in accumulation of reactive molecules capable of forming adducts with DNA and proteins and also resulting in oxidative stress. Preliminary evidence in rodent models of peripheral neuropathy suggest that DCA-induced neurotoxicity may be mitigated by naturally occurring antioxidants and by a specific class of muscarinic receptor antagonists. These findings generate a number of testable hypotheses regarding the etiology and treatment of DCA peripheral neuropathy.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Nitric oxide (NO), haemoglobin and melatonin interact with each other not only in blood stream of human beings, but also in the cells and metabolically active conducting strands of plants. Specialised sites of biosynthesis and differential intracellular spatial distribution of these molecules have been clearly demonstrated by the authors in plant systems. This has led to an understanding of the role of these molecules under salt stress conditions experienced by plants: NO is a modulator of enzyme activity through S-nitrosylation and  nitration, haemoglobin (phytoglobin) is an NO scavenger, and melatonin is a reactive  species (ROS) scavenger involved in key crosstalk in both plants and humans facing stress.

Although  kinase inhibitors can inhibit the activity of BCR-ABL fusion protein to trigger the cells apoptosis, drug resistance or intolerance exists in part of CML patients. Arsenic sulfide in its raw form (r-AsS) can be orally administrated and certain therapeutic effects have been found out in the treatment of hematologic malignancies through inducing cell apoptosis.In this work, a water-dissolvable arsenic sulfide nanoformualtion (ee-AsS) composed of AsS particulates with 470 nm in diameter and encapsulated by a kind of hydrophilic polymer was fabricated and applied to the CML cell line K562, K562/AO2 and primary cells from the bone marrow of CML patients.Results showed that instead of inhibiting the activity of BCR-ABL, ee-AsS induced direct degradation of BCR-ABL in K562 cells within 6 hr incubation, followed by the occurrence of erythroid differentiation in K562 after 72 hr incubation, evidenced by the significantly upregulated CD235a and benzidine staining, which was not detectable with r-AsS. The ee-AsS-induced erythroid differentiation was also observed in K562/AO2 cells and bone marrow mononuclear cells of CML patients. Mechanistic studies indicated that ee-AsS induced autophagy by downregulating the level of intracellular ROS and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α significantly, which led to the subsequent degradation of BCR-ABL. When the concentration was increased, ee-AsS induced much more significant apoptosis and cell cycle arrest than r-AsS, and the cytotoxicity of the former was about 178 times of the latter.ee-AsS was capable of inducing significant erythroid differentiation of CML cells by inducing the direct degradation of BCR-ABL; the new effect could improve hematopoietic function of CML patients as well as inhibit the leukemic cell proliferation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007730>Denitrase activity of  reduces the oxidized compound 3-nitrotyrosine in mice liver with colitis.</a></h1><p>The oxidation of  to 3-nitrotyrosine is irreversible, and due to this characteristic, 3-nitrotyrosine is used as a marker for oxidative stress in a range of diverse chronic and degenerative diseases. It has been established that the yeast  can assimilate free 3-nitrotyrosine as unique source of nitrogen, and during saline stress, has a high denitrase activity to detoxify this compound in a reaction that involves the liberation of nitrogen dioxide from 3-nitrotyrosine. However, until now it has not been determined whether  can detoxify protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine such as nitrated proteins present in different chronic illnesses. TThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the denitrase activity of  to reduce 3-nitrotyrosine from liver proteins of mice with colitis. Firstly, the levels of reactive  species of liver tissue of colitic and control mice were measured by the reaction with the 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Denitrase activity of  was evaluated by incubating cell extracts of the yeast with protein extracts from livers of mice with colitis. Following incubation, 3-nitrotyrosine was measured, and to corroborate that denitrase reaction had occurred, the production of nitrites was measured. In samples of liver tissue from mice with colitis, the maximum levels of reactive  species were up to two times higher compared with the control livers. Following the incubation of colitic liver samples with cell extracts of , it was observed that 3-nitrotyrosine decreased to the basal concentration of control liver samples, and that the concentration of nitrites was increased. These results indicate that denitrase of  extracts can effectively detoxify 3-nitrotyrosine bound to proteins and that the extracts could be used to decrease protein oxidation damage in chronic degenerative diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601683>Next-Generation Cell-active Inhibitors of the Undrugged Oncogenic PTP4A3 Phosphatase.</a></h1><p>Oncogenic protein  phosphatases are overexpressed in numerous human cancers but they have been challenging pharmacological targets. The emblematic oncogenic PTP4A  phosphatase family regulates many fundamental malignant processes. JMS-053 (7-imino-2-phenylthieno[3,2-c]pyridine-4,6(5H,7H)-dione) is a novel, potent and selective PTP4A inhibitor but its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated nor the chemotype fully investigated. Because  phosphatases are notoriously susceptible to oxidation, we interrogated JMS-053 and three newly synthesized analogs with specific attention on the role of oxidation. JMS-053 and its three analogs were potent in vitro PTP4A3 inhibitors, but 7-imino-5-methyl-2-phenylthieno[3,2-c]pyridine-4,6(5H,7H)-dione (NRT-870-59) appeared unique among the thienopyridinediones with respect to its inhibitory specificity for PTP4A3 versus both a PTP4A3 A111S mutant and an oncogenic dual specificity  phosphatase CDC25B. Like JMS-053, NRT-870-59 was a reversible PTP4A3 inhibitor. All of the thienopyridinediones retained cytotoxicity against human ovarian and breast cancer cells grown as pathologically-relevant three-dimensional spheroids. Inhibition of cancer cell colony formation by NRT-870-59, like JMS-053, required PTP4A3 expression. JMS-053 failed to generated significant detectable reactive  species in vitro or in cancer cells. Mass spectrometry results indicated no disulfide bond formation nor oxidation of the catalytic Cys104 after in vitro incubation of PTP4A3 with JMS-053 or NRT-870-59. Gene expression profiling of cancer cells exposed to JMS-053 phenocopied many of the changes seen with the loss of PTP4A3 and did not indicate oxidative stress. These data demonstrate that PTP4A phosphatases can be selectively targeted with small molecules that lack prominent reactive  generation and encourage further studies of this chemotype. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Protein  phosphatases are emerging as important contributors to human cancers. We report on a new class of reversible protein phosphatase small molecule inhibitors that are cytotoxic to human ovarian and breast cancer cells, do not generate significant reactive  species in vitro and in cells, and could be valuable lead molecules for future studies of PTP4A phosphatases.The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281512>Melatonin enhances sorafenib-induced cytotoxicity in FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukemia cells by redox modification.</a></h1><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an internal tandem duplication in Fms-related  kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) is identified as a subgroup with poor outcome and intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy and therefore urgent need for development of novel therapeutic strategies. : The antitumor effects of melatonin alone or combined with sorafenib were evaluated via flow cytometry and immunoblotting assays in FLT-ITD AML cells.

The calixarene backbone forces the corresponding copper(II) complex into a see-saw-type structure, which is hitherto unprecedented in GO modelling chemistry. It undergoes a one-electron oxidation that is centered at the phenolate donor leading to a copper-coordinated phenoxyl radical like in the GO. Accordingly, the complex was tested as a functional model and indeed proved capable of oxidizing benzyl alcohol to the respective aldehyde using two phenoxyl-radical equivalents as oxidants. Finally, the results show that the calixarene platform can be utilized to arrange donor functions to biomimetic binding pockets that allow for the creation of novel types of model compounds.© 2019 The Authors.

Increasing evidences have shown that the overproduction of reactive  species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) play an important role in the development of the T2D. Interestingly, our previous studies indicated that heme could bind to hIAPP, and the complex might induce the nitration of  residue (Y37) of hIAPP in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and nitrite. However, it remains unclear about effect of the nitration on the implicated function of hIAPP in the development of T2D. In this study, fluorescent assays, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscope (AFM) were used to demonstrate that nitration of hIAPP significantly decreased its fibril formation. But the decreased fibril formation was not through the diminished aggregation of hIAPP monomer as suggested by the results of circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) and gel electrophoresis assay. Surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy (SERS) indicated that nitration of hIAPP impaired the intermolecular hydrogen bonding. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that nitration of hIAPP may block the intermolecular hydrogen bonding, leading to the inhibition of its fibril formation. In addition, cytotoxicity study of native and modified hIAPP was also performed on INS-1 cells, which revealed exacerbated toxicity of hIAPP by its nitration. The findings in this study that nitration of hIAPP promotes its oligomer formation and thus exacerbates its cytotoxicity suggests a possible link between the nitrite (or the sum of nitrite and nitrate) levels and T2D, and ameliorated nitration of hIAPP by diminishing nitrative stress might be a promising therapeutic strategy for T2D.Copyright © 2019.

Indeed, it is unknown whether the mechanism of IR in PCOS is mediated through changes in the metabolome.  Twelve women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and ten age and body mass index matched controls completed an 8 week supervised exercise program at 60% maximal  consumption. Before and after the exercise program, all participants underwent maximal IR stimulation with intralipid infusions followed by insulin sensitivity (IS) measurement by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamps. Amino acid profiles and metabolites were taken at baseline and at maximal insulin resistance stimulation before and after the exercise program.  At baseline, PCOS subjects showed increased leucine/isoleucine, glutamate, methionine, ornithine, phenylalanine,  and proline ( < 0.05) that, following exercise, did not differ from controls. While compering within the groups, no significant changes in the amino acid levels before and after exercise were observed. Exercise improved VO2 max ( < 0.01) but did not alter weight. Amino acid profiles were unaffected by an acute increase in IR induced by the lipid infusion. IS was lower in PCOS ( < 0.001) and was further decreased by the lipid infusion in both PCOS and controls. Although, exercise improved IS in both PCOS and in controls, the IS remained compromised in PCOS.  The baseline amino acid profile in PCOS reflected that seen in obese subjects and differed to controls. After exercise, and despite no change in weight in either group, there were no differences in the amino acid profile between PCOS and controls. This shows that exercise may normalize the amino acid metabolome, irrespective of weight. : ISRCTN42448814.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30740864>Influence of pH and micellar systems on the sensitized photo-oxidation of bovine serum albumin.</a></h1><p>Photosensitized oxidation of bovine serum albumin (BSA), by using perinaphtenone as a sensitizer, has been studied at pH 7.4 and 11. The selected sensitizer does not present ground-state complexation with BSA and ensures that the mechanism is mediated by O ( △ ). Strong dependence between BSA-O ( △ ) photo-oxidation and the pH of the medium has been found. The relative  uptake rate (v ) and the total quenching rate constant (k ) values are higher at pH 11 than pH 7.4. The enhancement in the alkaline condition is due to conformational changes in the protein and the reactivity of tyrosinate anion with O ( △ ). Even when the tendency with the pH in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles is similar to that observed in homogeneous media, an increment on the k value is detected. This effect may be attributable to the strong interaction of BSA-SDS, which leads to the protein unfolding and could leave more exposed photo-oxidizable amino acids. A protective effect against the O ( △ )-mediated photo-oxidation was observed in reverse micelles (RMs) of sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) by comparing the k values obtained at W = 10 with respect to the one obtain in homogeneous media. The latter could be mainly explained by the modification in the solvent polarity. Also, another important observation was found, the internal pH inside RMs of AOT sensed through  absorption was independent of the one used for the formation of the water pool. Hence, the k values observed at both pH, are quite similar.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657228>Nitric Oxide-Dependent Protein Posttranslational Modifications Impair Mitochondrial Function and Metabolism to Contribute to Neurodegenerative Diseases.</a></h1><p>Most brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases manifest mitochondrial dysfunction as well as elevated production of reactive  and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), contributing to synapse loss and neuronal injury.

The binuclear active site in C cO comprises a high-spin heme associated with a Cu complex and a redox active . The electron transport in the respiratory chain is driven by increasing midpoint potentials of the involved cofactors, resulting in a release of free energy, which is stored by coupling the electron transfer to proton translocation across a membrane, building up an electrochemical gradient. In this context, the midpoint potentials of the active site cofactors in the C cOs are of special interest, since they determine the driving forces for the individual  reduction steps and thereby affect the efficiency of the proton pumping. It has been difficult to obtain useful information on some of these midpoint potentials from experiments. However, since each of the reduction steps in the catalytic cycle of  reduction to water corresponds to the formation of an O-H bond, they can be calculated with a reasonably high accuracy using quantum chemical methods. From the calculated O-H bond strengths, the proton-coupled midpoint potentials of the active site cofactors can be estimated. Using models representing the different families of C cO's (A, B, and C), the calculations give midpoint potentials that should be relevant during catalytic turnover. The calculations also suggest possible explanations for why some experimentally measured potentials deviate significantly from the calculated ones, i.e., for Cu in all oxidase families, and for heme b in the C family.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387985>Hydrogen peroxide inducible clone-5 sustains NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive  species-c-jun N-terminal kinase signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Target therapy aiming at critical molecules within the metastatic signal pathways is essential for prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. Hic-5 (hydrogen peroxide inducible clone-5) which belongs to the paxillin superfamily, can be stimulated by a lot of metastatic factors, such as transforming growth factor (TGF-β), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and reactive  species (ROS). Previous studies implicated Hic-5 cross-talks with the ROS-c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal cascade in a positive feedback manner. In this report, we addressed this issue in a comprehensive manner. By RNA interference and ectopic Hic-5 expression, we demonstrated Hic-5 was essential for activation of NADPH oxidase and ROS generation leading to activation of downstream JNK and c-jun transcription factor. This was initiated by interaction of Hic-5 with the regulator and adaptor of NADPH oxidase, Rac1 and Traf4, respectively, which may further phosphorylate the nonreceptor  kinase Pyk2 at Tyr881. On the other hand, promoter activity assay coupled with deletion mapping and site directed mutagenesis strategies demonstrated the distal c-jun and AP4 putative binding regions (943-1126 bp upstream of translational start site) were required for transcriptional activation of Hic-5. Thus Hic-5 was both downstream and upstream of NADPH oxidase-ROS-JNK-c-jun cascade. This signal circuit was essential for regulating the expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors, such as Snail, Zeb1, E-cadherin, and matrix metalloproteinase 9, involved in HCC cell migration and metastasis. Due to the limited expression of Hic-5 in normal tissue, it can be a promising therapeutic target for preventing HCC metastasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712667>The Angiotensin II type 1 receptor mediates the effects of low  on early placental angiogenesis.</a></h1><p>Placental development occurs in a low  environment, which stimulates angiogenesis by upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1) and the angiopoietin-2/-1 ratio (ANGPT2/1). At this time, Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ATR) is highly expressed. We postulated that the early gestation placental  milieu, by stimulating the angiotensin (Ang) II/ATR pathway, increases expression of proliferative/angiogenic factors.HTR-8/SVneo cells were cultured in 1%, 5% or 20% O with the ATR antagonist (losartan) for 48 h. mRNA and protein levels of angiogenic factors were determined by qPCR and ELISA. Angiogenesis and cell viability were assessed by HUVEC tube formation and resazurin assay.Culture in low  (1%) increased angiogenic VEGFA, SERPINE1 and placental growth factor (PGF) mRNA and VEGFA and SERPINE1 protein levels, and reduced anti-angiogenic ANGPT1, endoglin (ENG) and soluble fms-like  kinase-e15a (sFlt-e15a) mRNA (all P = 0.0001). At 1% , losartan significantly reduced intracellular VEGFA and SERPINE1 levels and secreted VEGF levels (P = 0.008, 0.0001 and 0.0001). HUVEC tube formation was increased in cells grown in HTR-8/SVneo conditioned medium from 1 to 5% cultures (all P = 0.0001). HUVECs cultured in medium from losartan treated HTR-8/SVneo cells had a reduced number of meshes, branching points and total branching length (P = 0.004, 0.003 and 0.0002). At 1% , losartan partially inhibited the -induced increase in cell viability (P = 0.0001).Thus, ATR blockade antagonised the low  induced increase in pro-angiogenic factor expression and cell viability. Our findings highlight a role for an -sensitive Ang II/ATR pathway during placentation.Copyright © 2018.

However, the contribution of the β-catenin pathway in this process has not been explored. Here, we show that AKT-mediated phosphorylated β-catenin supports T. gondii multiplication which is arrested in the deficiency of its phosphorylation domain at S552 position. The β-catenin-TCF4 protein complex binds to the promoter region of IRF3 gene and initiates its transcription, which was also abrogated in β-catenin knockout cells. TBK-independent phosphorylation of STING(S366) and its adaptor molecule TICAM2 by phospho-AKT(T308S473) augmented downstream IRF3-dependent IDO1 transcription, which was also dependent on β-catenin. But, proteasomal degradation of IDO1 by its  phosphorylation (at Y115 and Y253) favoured parasite replication. In absence of IDO1, tryptophan was catabolized into melatonin, which supressed cellular reactive  species (ROS) and boosted parasite growth. Conversely, when  phosphorylation was abolished by phosphosite mutations, IDO1 escaped its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation system (UPS) and the stable IDO1 prevented parasite replication by kynurenine synthesis. We propose that T. gondii selectively utilizes tryptophan to produce the antioxidant, melatonin, thus prolonging the survival of infected cells through functional AKT and β-catenin activity for better parasite replication. Stable IDO1 in the presence of IFN-γ catabolized tryptophan into kynurenine, promoting cell death by suppressing phospho-AKT and phospho-β-catenin levels, and circumvented parasite replication. Treatment of infected cells with kynurenine or its analogue, teriflunomide suppressed kinase activity of AKT, and phosphorylation of β-catenin triggering caspase-3 dependent apoptosis of infected cells to inhibit parasite growth. Our results demonstrate that β-catenin regulate phosphorylated STING-TICAM2-IRF3-IDO1 signalosome for a cell-intrinsic pro-parasitic role. We propose that the downstream IRF3-IDO1-reliant tryptophan catabolites and their analogues can act as effective immunotherapeutic molecules to control T. gondii replication by impairing the AKT and β-catenin axis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31438928>Temporal echocardiographic assessment of pulmonary hypertension in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients treated with nintedanib with or without  therapy.</a></h1><p>Nintedanib is an inhibitor of receptor  kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, but its effects on pulmonary hypertension (PH) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients with chronic hypoxia were unclear.This study included a nintedanib prospective study and historical control study. In the nintedanib prospective study, pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) measured using transthoracic echocardiography was evaluated at six points during 48 weeks in 16 IPF patients in whom nintedanib was started. In the historical control study, adjusted annual change in PASP was compared between patients treated with (n = 16) and without (n = 15) nintedanib.In the nintedanib prospective study, the mean PASP at 48 weeks after starting nintedanib was significantly higher compared to that at baseline. When IPF patients were divided into two groups, IPF patients with or without long-term  treatment (LTOT), mean PASP at 48 weeks was significantly higher than that at baseline only in IPF patients receiving LTOT (P = 0.001). In the historical control study, adjusted annual change in PASP in IPF patients treated with nintedanib was significantly lower than that in patients treated with no antifibrotic agents when considering patients without LTOT (0.26 mmHg vs 7.05 mmHg; P = 0.011).We found differential effects of nintedanib on PH between IPF patients with or without LTOT. Nintedanib may have a disadvantageous effect on PH in IPF patients with LTOT. Conversely, nintedanib treatment may be beneficial to PH in IPF patients without LTOT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518391>Glucosylceramide synthase silencing combined with the receptor  kinase inhibitor axitinib as a new multimodal strategy for glioblastoma.</a></h1><p>A great deal of evidence has been accumulated revealing that lipid metabolism is drastically altered during tumorigenesis. In this work, glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) was targeted, using RNA interference technology (siRNAs), in U87 and DBTRG human glioblastoma (GBM) cells, as in both cell types GCS showed to be overexpressed with respect to normal human astrocytes. The efficacy of a combined therapy to tackle GBM, allying GCS silencing to the new generation chemotherapeutics sunitinib and axitinib, or to the alkylating drugs etoposide and temozolomide, is evaluated here for the first time. With this purpose, studies addressing GBM cell viability and proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were performed, which revealed that combination of GCS silencing with axitinib treatment represents a promising therapeutic approach. The reduction of cell viability induced by this combined therapy is proposed to be mediated by excessive production of reactive  species. This work, identifying GCS as a key molecular target to increase GBM susceptibility to a new generation chemotherapeutic, opens windows to the development of innovative strategies to halt GBM recurrence after surgical resection.© The Author(s) 2019.

Sodium orthovanadate (NaVO,) competitively inhibits the protein  phosphatases that affect intracellular protein phosphorylation. No study has examined the role of protein  phosphatases in kainic acid (KA)-induced excitotoxic injury using sodium orthovanadate. Thus, the present study was conducted to determine the neuroprotective effects of sodium orthovanadate on KA-induced neuronal death in organotypic hippocampal slice culture. We also performed an in vivo electrophysiology study in Sprague-Dawley rats to observe the function of surviving cells after sodium orthovanadate treatment in KA-induced excitotoxicity. Rats were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and KA was injected unilaterally in CA3 of the hippocampus by microinjection-cannula. Neuronal cell death, as assessed by propidium iodide uptake, was reduced by 10 and 25 μM sodium orthovanadate treatment (24 and 48 h) compared with the KA-only group. Sodium orthovanadate enhanced survival signals by increasing levels of phospho-Akt and superoxide dismutase. In addition, sodium orthovanadate treatment reduced calcineurin level for neuronal protection, which regulates activation of cellular calcium caused by KA-induced injury. In vivo results showed that sodium orthovanadate treatment elicited resistance to KA-induced behavior seizures and significantly reduced the duration of epileptiform discharges. In addition, sodium orthovanadate treatment (25 mM) significantly prevented the increase in power spectra induced by KA injection. These results suggest that sodium orthovanadate decreases the acute effects of KA, thereby inducing neuroprotective effects with reduced reactive  species and cellular Ca. Thus, sodium orthovanadate may protect hippocampal neurons against excitotoxicity, and surviving neurons may function to reduce seizures.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates changes in the urine metabolome following acute intake of polyphenol-rich juice, purple grumixama juice. Grumixama (Eugenia brasiliensis Lam.) is a cherry native to Brazil that is known to be a rich source of anthocyanins and ellagitannins. In this research 15 healthy subjects consumed a single dose of grumixama juice. Urine samples were collected before grumixama juice intake, 0-1, 1-2, 2-4 h, with fasting at 24 h after intake. Plasma samples were also collected before intake, 30' and at 1 h, 2 h and 4 h, with fasting at 24 h after juice intake. The urine primary metabolites were analysed by a metabolomic approach using gas chromatography mass spectrometry with methyl chloroformate derivatisation for amino acids and organic acids. Also, an  radical absorbance capacity method was carried out to evaluate the plasma samples antioxidant capacity changes. Subjects showed increase in plasma antioxidant capacity after juice intake (p-values < .05). A total of 114 metabolites were assessed in urine (1-2 h and 2-4 h), including 17 amino acids, 47 organic acids and several other metabolites. Among the 114 metabolites, 25 were significantly changed during the first 4 h following juice intake, as shown by the Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (0.5 > p(corr) > 0.3) and univariate analysis (p-values < .05). Some metabolites were related to mitochondrial metabolism, such as glyoxylic acid and oxalic acid. Metabolites related to amino acid metabolism were also changed, such as beta-alanine, l-phenylalanine and . In conclusion, results suggest that acute intake of grumixama juice could affect amino acid metabolism and mitochondrial metabolism, but the related health implications should be explored in further studies using additional approaches.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the efficacy and adverse effect profile in patients with HPS are unknown. We aimed to determine the effect of sorafenib on the alveolar-arterial  gradient (AaPO ) at 3 months in patients with HPS. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial of sorafenib in patients with HPS at 7 centers. A total of 28 patients with HPS were randomized to sorafenib 400 mg by mouth daily or a matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. We found no statistically significant difference in the median change in AaPO from baseline to 12 weeks between the patients allocated to sorafenib (4.5 mm Hg; IQR, -3.8 to 7.0 mm Hg) and those allocated to placebo (-2.4 mm Hg; IQR, -4.8 to 8.2 mm Hg; P = 0.70). There was also no difference between the groups in terms of degree of intrapulmonary shunting by contrast echocardiography. Sorafenib significantly reduced circulating levels of angiogenic markers, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (P < 0.01) and TIE2-expressing M2 monocytes (P = 0.03), but it reduced the mental component scores of the Short Form 36 (P = 0.04), indicating a worse quality of life. In conclusion, sorafenib did not change the AaPO or other disease markers at 3 months in patients with HPS. Alternative antiangiogenic therapies or treatments targeting other pathways should be investigated.Copyright © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666736>Loss of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase causes light-dependent increases in protochlorophyllide and cell death in Arabidopsis.</a></h1><p>Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) catalyses the final step of the  degradation pathway, which is essential to animals but was of unknown importance in plants until we found that mutation of Short-day Sensitive Cell Death1 (SSCD1), encoding Arabidopsis FAH, results in cell death under short-day conditions. The sscd1 mutant accumulates succinylacetone (SUAC), an abnormal metabolite caused by loss of FAH. Succinylacetone is an inhibitor of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (ALAD), which is involved in chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis. In this study, we investigated whether sscd1 cell death is mediated by Chl biosynthesis and found that ALAD activity is repressed in sscd1 and that protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), an intermediate of Chl biosynthesis, accumulates at lower levels in etiolated sscd1 seedlings. However, it was interesting that Pchlide in sscd1 might increase after transfer from light to dark and that HEMA1 and CHLH are upregulated in the light-dark transition before Pchlide levels increased. Upon re-illumination after Pchlide levels had increased, reactive  species marker genes, including singlet -induced genes, are upregulated, and the sscd1 cell death phenotype appears. In addition, Arabidopsis WT seedlings treated with SUAC mimic sscd1 in decline of ALAD activity and accumulation of Pchlide as well as cell death. These results demonstrate that increase in Pchlide causes cell death in sscd1 upon re-illumination and suggest that a decline in the Pchlide pool due to inhibition of ALAD activity by SUAC impairs the repression of ALA synthesis from the light-dark transition by feedback control, resulting in activation of the Chl biosynthesis pathway and accumulation of Pchlide in the dark.© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288719>A review on anticancer potentials of benzothiazole derivatives.</a></h1><p>Benzothiazole is an organic compound bearing a heterocyclic nucleus (thiazole) that imparts a broad spectrum of biological activity to it. The significant and potent activity of benzothiazole moiety influenced distinctively by nature and position of substitutions. This review summarizes of the effect of various substituents in recent trends and approaches to design and develop novel benzothiazole derivatives for anticancer potential in different cell lines by interpreting the structure-activity relationship (SAR) and mechanism of action of a wide range of derivatives. The list of derivatives are categorized in different groups and reviewed for their anticancer activity. The structure-activity relationship for the various derivatives revealed an excellent understanding of benzothiazole moiety in the field of cancer therapy against different cancer cell line. Data obtained from the various articles showed the potential effect of benzothiazole moiety and its derivatives to produce the peculiar and significant lead compound. The important anticancer mechanisms found are  kinase inhibition, topoisomerase inhibition and induction of apoptosis by reactive  species (ROS) activation. Therefore, the design and development of novel benzothiazole have broad scope in cancer chemotherapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332285>Effect of antioxidants on BPA-induced stress on sperm function in a mouse model.</a></h1><p>In the past few years, bisphenol A, (BPA) an endocrine-disrupting chemical, has received increasing attention because of its detrimental health effects. There is ample evidence to support that BPA interferes with the reproductive health of humans and animals. In spermatozoa, BPA-induced adverse effects are mostly caused by increased oxidative stress. Using an in vitro experimental model, we examined whether antioxidants (glutathione, vitamin C, and vitamin E) have defensive effects against BPA-induced stress in spermatozoa. The results showed that antioxidants inhibit the overproduction of reactive  species (basically cellular peroxides) and increase intracellular ATP levels, thereby preventing motility loss and abnormal acrosome reaction in BPA-exposed spermatozoa. In particular, glutathione and vitamin E reduced the protein kinase A-dependent  phosphorylation in spermatozoa and, thus, prevented the precocious acrosome reaction from occurring. Furthermore, we found that the compromised fertilisation and early embryo development mediated by BPA-exposed spermatozoa can be improved following their supplementation with glutathione and vitamin E. Based on these findings, we suggest that antioxidants reduce oxidative stress in BPA-exposed spermatozoa, thus preventing detrimental effects on their function and fertility.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981830>Therapeutic potential of a TrkB agonistic antibody for ischemic brain injury.</a></h1><p>The clinical trials employing neuroprotectants targeting single, early pathogenic mechanisms in stroke have so far been barely successful. We found in human postmortem stroke brains that in addition to apoptosis, necroptosis also contributed to neuronal damage. Thus, a new strategy targeting both mechanisms might be necessary. While brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a potent survival factor for neurons, its poor bioavailability including low diffusion rate and short half-life makes it unlikely a therapeutic agent. We recently developed a TrkB agonistic antibody (Ab4B19) that mimicked BDNF functionally but exhibited better physicochemical and pharmacological features. We showed that Ab4B19 halted neuronal death in vitro under multiple conditions that simulate ischemia/reperfusion injury, including -glucose deprivation (OGD), glutamate toxicity, oxidative stress and nutrient deprivation. In a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion, Ab4B19 suppressed both apoptosis and necroptosis, leading to a reduction in infarct volume and acceleration of functional recovery from sensorimotor impairments. In neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), Ab4B19 activated TrkB and its downstream signaling, and rescued neuronal death from OGD at a similar level as that in mouse neurons. Together, our study revealed necroptosis in human stroke brain, and demonstrated a BDNF-based strategy targeting both apoptosis and necroptosis for ischemic stroke treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Melanin has the ability to block ultraviolet (UV) radiation and scavenge free  radicals, thus protecting the skin from their harmful effects. Agents that increase melanin synthesis in melanocytes may reduce the risk of photodamage and skin cancer. The present study investigates the effect of RBM on pigmentation in zebrafish and the underlying mechanism. RBM was found to significantly increase the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a key transcription factor involved in melanin production. RBM also suppressed the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which negatively regulates zebrafish pigmentation. Together, these results suggest that RBM promotes melanin biosynthesis in zebrafish.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671767>Anti-Cancer and Ototoxicity Characteristics of the Curcuminoids, CLEFMA and EF24, in Combination with Cisplatin.</a></h1><p>In this study, we investigated whether the curcuminoids, CLEFMA and EF24, improved cisplatin efficacy and reduced cisplatin ototoxicity. We used the lung cancer cell line, A549, to determine the effects of the curcuminoids and cisplatin on cell viability and several apoptotic signaling mechanisms. Cellular viability was measured using the MTT assay. A scratch assay was used to measure cell migration and fluorescent spectrophotometry to measure reactive  species (ROS) production. Western blots and luminescence assays were used to measure the expression and activity of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), caspases-3/7, -8, -9, and -12, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and proto-oncogene -protein kinase (Src). A zebrafish model was used to evaluate auditory effects. Cisplatin, the curcuminoids, and their combinations had similar effects on cell viability (IC values: 2-16 μM) and AIF, caspase-12, JNK, MAPK, and Src expression, while caspase-3/7, -8, and -9 activity was unchanged or decreased. Cisplatin increased ROS yield (1.2-fold), and curcuminoid and combination treatments reduced ROS (0.75-0.85-fold). Combination treatments reduced A549 migration (0.51-0.53-fold). Both curcuminoids reduced auditory threshold shifts induced by cisplatin. In summary, cisplatin and the curcuminoids might cause cell death through AIF and caspase-12. The curcuminoids may potentiate cisplatin's effect against A549 migration, but may counteract cisplatin's effect to increase ROS production. The curcuminoids might also prevent cisplatin ototoxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042082>Organic dust induces inflammatory gene expression in lung epithelial cells via ROS-dependent STAT-3 activation.</a></h1><p>Exposure to dust in agricultural and animal environments, known as organic dust, is associated with the development of respiratory symptoms and respiratory diseases. Inflammation is a key feature of lung pathologies associated with organic dust exposure, and exposure to organic dust induces the expression of several immune and inflammatory mediators. However, information on transcription factors and cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the production of immune and inflammatory mediators induced by organic dust is limited. In this study, we have identified STAT-3 as an important transcription factor controlling the induction of expression of immune and inflammatory mediators by poultry dust extracts in airway epithelial cells and in mouse lungs and delineated the cellular pathway for STAT-3 activation. Poultry dust extract activated STAT-3 phosphorylation in Beas2B and normal human bronchial epithelial cells and in mouse lungs. Chemical inhibition and siRNA knockdown of STAT-3 suppressed induction of immune and inflammatory mediator expression. Antioxidants suppressed the increase of STAT-3 phosphorylation induced by poultry dust extract indicating that oxidative stress [elevated reactive  species (ROS) levels] is important for the activation. Chemical inhibition and siRNA knockdown experiments demonstrated that STAT-3 activation is dependent on the activation of nonreceptor -protein kinase 2 (TYK2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  kinases. Our studies show that poultry dust extract controls the induction of immune and inflammatory mediator expression via a cellular pathway involving oxidative stress-mediated STAT-3 activation by TYK2 and EGFR  kinases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533842>Identification of key DNA methylation-driven genes in prostate adenocarcinoma: an integrative analysis of TCGA methylation data.</a></h1><p>Prostate cancer (PCa) remains the second leading cause of deaths due to cancer in the United States in men. The aim of this study was to perform an integrative epigenetic analysis of prostate adenocarcinoma to explore the epigenetic abnormalities involved in the development and progression of prostate adenocarcinoma. The key DNA methylation-driven genes were also identified.Methylation and RNA-seq data were downloaded for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Methylation and gene expression data from TCGA were incorporated and analyzed using MethylMix package. Methylation data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were assessed by R package limma to obtain differentially methylated genes. Pathway analysis was performed on genes identified by MethylMix criteria using ConsensusPathDB. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were also applied for the identification of pathways in which DNA methylation-driven genes significantly enriched. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module analysis in Cytoscape software were used to find the hub genes. Two methylation profile (GSE112047 and GSE76938) datasets were utilized to validate screened hub genes. Immunohistochemistry of these hub genes were evaluated by the Human Protein Atlas.A total of 553 samples in TCGA database, 32 samples in GSE112047 and 136 samples in GSE76938 were included in this study. There were a total of 266 differentially methylated genes were identified by MethylMix. Plus, a total of 369 differentially methylated genes and 594 differentially methylated genes were identified by the R package limma in GSE112047 and GSE76938, respectively. GO term enrichment analysis suggested that DNA methylation-driven genes significantly enriched in oxidation-reduction process, extracellular exosome, electron carrier activity, response to reactive  species, and aldehyde dehydrogenase [NAD(P)+] activity. KEGG pathway analysis found DNA methylation-driven genes significantly enriched in five pathways including drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, phenylalanine metabolism, histidine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and  metabolism. The validated hub genes were MAOB and RTP4.Methylated hub genes, including MAOB and RTP4, can be regarded as novel biomarkers for accurate PCa diagnosis and treatment.

An emerging scenario is that cancer cells increase ROS to activate protumorigenic signaling while activating antioxidant pathways to maintain redox homeostasis. Here we show that, in basal-like and BRCA1-related breast cancer (BC), ROS levels correlate with the expression and activity of the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Mechanistically, ROS triggers AhR nuclear accumulation and activation to promote the transcription of both antioxidant enzymes and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand, amphiregulin (AREG). In a mouse model of BRCA1-related BC, cancer-associated AhR and AREG control tumor growth and production of chemokines to attract monocytes and activate proangiogenic function of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, the expression of these chemokines as well as infiltration of monocyte-lineage cells (monocyte and macrophages) positively correlated with ROS levels in basal-like BC. These data support the existence of a coordinated link between cancer-intrinsic ROS regulation and the features of tumor microenvironment. Therapeutically, chemical inhibition of AhR activity sensitizes human BC models to Erlotinib, a selective EGFR  kinase inhibitor, suggesting a promising combinatorial anticancer effect of AhR and EGFR pathway inhibition. Thus, AhR represents an attractive target to inhibit redox homeostasis and modulate the tumor promoting microenvironment of basal-like and BRCA1-associated BC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31318686>Cysteine, glutathione and a new genetic code: biochemical adaptations of the primordial cells that spread into open water and survived biospheric oxygenation.</a></h1><p>Life most likely developed under hyperthermic and anaerobic conditions in close vicinity to a stable geochemical source of energy. Epitomizing this conception, the first cells may have arisen in submarine hydrothermal vents in the middle of a gradient established by the hot and alkaline hydrothermal fluid and the cooler and more acidic water of the ocean. To enable their escape from this energy-providing gradient layer, the early cells must have overcome a whole series of obstacles. Beyond the loss of their energy source, the early cells had to adapt to a loss of external iron-sulfur catalysis as well as to a formidable temperature drop. The developed solutions to these two problems seem to have followed the principle of maximum parsimony: Cysteine was introduced into the genetic code to anchor iron-sulfur clusters, and fatty acid unsaturation was installed to maintain lipid bilayer viscosity. Unfortunately, both solutions turned out to be detrimental when the biosphere became more oxidizing after the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. To render cysteine thiol groups and fatty acid unsaturation compatible with life under , numerous counter-adaptations were required including the advent of glutathione and the addition of the four latest amino acids (methionine, , tryptophan, selenocysteine) to the genetic code. In view of the continued diversification of derived antioxidant mechanisms, it appears that modern life still struggles with the initially developed strategies to escape from its hydrothermal birthplace. Only archaea may have found a more durable solution by entirely exchanging their lipid bilayer components and rigorously restricting cysteine usage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500245>The Phosphatase SHP-2 Activates HIF-1α in Wounds In Vivo by Inhibition of 26S Proteasome Activity.</a></h1><p>Vascular remodeling and angiogenesis are required to improve the perfusion of ischemic tissues. The hypoxic environment, induced by ischemia, is a potent stimulus for hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) upregulation and activation, which induce pro-angiogenic gene expression. We previously showed that the  phosphatase SHP-2 drives hypoxia mediated HIF-1α upregulation via inhibition of the proteasomal pathway, resulting in revascularization of wounds in vivo. However, it is still unknown if SHP-2 mediates HIF-1α upregulation by affecting 26S proteasome activity and how the proteasome is regulated upon hypoxia. Using a reporter construct containing the -dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-1α and a fluorogenic proteasome substrate in combination with SHP-2 mutant constructs, we show that SHP-2 inhibits the 26S proteasome activity in endothelial cells under hypoxic conditions in vitro via Src kinase/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling. Moreover, the simultaneous expression of constitutively active SHP-2 (E76A) and inactive SHP-2 (CS) in separate hypoxic wounds in the mice dorsal skin fold chamber by localized magnetic nanoparticle-assisted lentiviral transduction showed specific regulation of proteasome activity in vivo. Thus, we identified a new additional mechanism of SHP-2 mediated HIF-1α upregulation and proteasome activity, being functionally important for revascularization of wounds in vivo. SHP-2 may therefore constitute a potential novel therapeutic target for the induction of angiogenesis in ischemic vascular disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30944614>Synthesis and physiological implications of melanic pigments.</a></h1><p>The process of melanin synthesis and distribution is called melanogenesis, a process that is based on melanocytes present among the basal cells of the epidermis. Pigments formed in melanocyte melanosomes are then stored in the basal layer of epidermal cells, as well as in dermal macrophages, which become melanophores. From the embryological point of view, melanocytes derive from the melanoblasts of the neural crest, from where they migrate during the first months of life into the skin, eye, cochlea, bone, peripheral nervous system, heart and adipose tissue. The melanic pigments, eumelanin and pheomelanin, are the final product of complex biochemical reactions starting from the amino acid . Melanin has a major role in skin homeostasis through the photoprotection it offers from the harmful effect of ultraviolet radiation. Melanin absorbs and/or reflects ultraviolet radiation but is also involved in the neutralizing process of free radicals and reactive  species. Pigmentogenesis is a dependent  process and is controlled by intrinsic factors (genetic and hormonal) as well as extrinsic factors (ultraviolet radiation). Melanogenesis is stimulated by stimulant melanocytic hormone, adrenocorticotropin hormone, estrogens and progesterone.

Exposure of the  transport protein horse heart myoglobin (hhMb) to HOCl inhibits Iron III (Fe(III))-heme reduction by cytochrome 5 to -binding Iron II (Fe(II))Mb. Pathological concentrations of HOCl yielded myoglobin oxidation products of increased electrophoretic mobility and markedly different UV/Vis absorbance. Mass analysis indicated HOCl caused successive mass increases of 16 a.m.u., consistent serial addition of molecular  to the protein. By contrast, parallel analysis of protein chlorination by quantitative mass spectrometry revealed a comparatively minor increase in the 3-chlorotyrosine/ ratio. Pre-treatment of hhMb with HOCl affected the peroxidase reaction between the hemoprotein and HO as judged by a HOCl dose-dependent decrease in spin-trapped tyrosyl radical detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and the rate constant of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) oxidation. By contrast, Mb catalase-like antioxidant activity remained unchanged under the same conditions. Notably, HOCl-modification of Mb decreased the rate of ferric-to-ferrous Mb reduction by a cytochrome b5 reductase system. Taken together, these data indicate oxidizing HOCl promotes Mb oxidation but not chlorination and that oxidized Mb shows altered Mb peroxidase-like activity and diminished rates of one-electron reduction by cytochrome b5 reductase, possibly affecting  storage and transport however, Mb-catalase-like antioxidant activity remains unchanged.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905847>Inactivation of the  phosphatase SHP-2 drives vascular dysfunction in Sepsis.</a></h1><p>Sepsis, the most severe form of infection, involves endothelial dysfunction which contributes to organ failure. To improve therapeutic prospects, elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial vascular failure is of essence.Polymicrobial contamination induced sepsis mouse model and primary endothelial cells incubated with sepsis serum were used to study SHP-2 in sepsis-induced endothelial inflammation. SHP-2 activity was assessed by dephosphorylation of pNPP, ROS production was measured by DCF oxidation and protein interactions were assessed by proximity ligation assay. Vascular inflammation was studied in the mouse cremaster model and in an in vitro flow assay.We identified ROS-dependent inactivation of the  phosphatase SHP-2 to be decisive for endothelial activation in sepsis. Using in vivo and in vitro sepsis models, we observed a significant reduction of endothelial SHP-2 activity, accompanied by enhanced adhesion molecule expression. The impaired SHP-2 activity was restored by ROS inhibitors and an IL-1 receptor antagonist. SHP-2 activity inversely correlated with the adhesive phenotype of endothelial cells exposed to IL-1β as well as sepsis serum via p38 MAPK and NF-κB. In vivo, SHP-2 inhibition accelerated IL-1β-induced leukocyte adhesion, extravasation and vascular permeability. Mechanistically, SHP-2 directly interacts with the IL-1R1 adaptor protein MyD88 via its  257, resulting in reduced binding of p85/PI3-K to MyD88.Our data show that SHP-2 inactivation by ROS in sepsis releases a protective break, resulting in endothelial activation.

LncRNA WNT5A-AS is upregulated in neural stem cells (NSCs), the proliferation of which is inhibited by sevoflurane. Thus, we hypothesized that knocking down of lncRNA WNT5A-AS may restore the fate of NSCs exposed to sevoflurane. To test this hypothesis, NSCs obtained from postnatal Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 2.4% sevoflurane or control gas for 6 h. Bioinformatics analysis, quantitative PCR and RNA interference technology were used to identify the properties of lncRNA WNT5A-AS. Cell proliferation was assessed using counting a Cell Counting Kit-cell 8 assay, a 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay, and a plate cloning assay. Cell survival was detected by flow cytometry, which was also used to examine the levels of reactive  species (ROS) and the cell cycle. The levels of WNT5A and receptor  kinase (Ryk) were measured via Western blotting. LncRNA WNT5A-AS was identified to have low coding potency and to be located on the antisense strand of WNT5A. The level of upregulated lncRNA WNT5A-AS was positively correlated with that of WNT5A in response to sevoflurane exposure. The knockdown of lncRNA WNT5A-AS promoted the proliferation and survival of NSCs, whereas it suppressed the WNT5A/Ryk-ROS signaling and drove cell cycle processes. Taken together, findings strongly suggest that the inhibition of lncRNA WNT5A-AS can rescue the fate of NSCs. In addition, WNT5A/Ryk-ROS signaling might be a downstream target of lncRNA WNT5A-AS.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

The aim of this study was to investigate whether changes in the gut microbiota alter gut-brain interactions inducing changes in blood pressure (BP). Recipient normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were orally gavaged with donor fecal contents from SHR and WKY. We divided the animals into four groups: WKY transplanted with WKY microbiota (W-W), SHR with SHR (S-S), WKY with SHR (W-S) and SHR with WKY (S-W). Basal systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were reduced with no change in heart rate as a result of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from WKY rats to SHR. Similarly, FMT from SHR to WKY increased basal SBP and DBP. Increases in both NADPH oxidase-driven reactive  species production and proinflammatory cytokines in brain paraventricular nucleus linked to higher BP drop with pentolinium and plasmatic noradrenaline (NA) levels were found in the S-S group as compared to the W-W group. These parameters were reduced by FMT from WKY to SHR. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines,  hydroxylase mRNA levels and NA content in the proximal colon, whereas reduced mRNA levels of gap junction proteins, were found in the S-S group as compared to the W-W group. These changes were inhibited by FMT from WKY to SHR. According to our correlation analyses, the abundance of  and  showed a negative correlation with high SBP. In conclusion, in SHR gut microbiota is an important factor involved in BP control, at least in part, as consequence of its effect on neuroinflammation and the sympathetic nervous system activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666866>Microsolvation of the Redox-Active -D in Photosystem II: Correlation of Energetics with EPR Spectroscopy and Oxidation-Induced Proton Transfer.</a></h1><p>Photosystem II (PSII) of oxygenic photosynthesis captures sunlight to drive the catalytic oxidation of water and the reduction of plastoquinone. Among the several redox-active cofactors that participate in intricate electron transfer pathways there are two  residues, Y and Y. They are situated in symmetry-related electron transfer branches but have different environments and play distinct roles. Y is the immediate oxidant of the -evolving MnCaO cluster, whereas Y serves regulatory and protective functions. The protonation states and hydrogen-bond network in the environment of Y remain debated, while the role of microsolvation in stabilizing different redox states of Y and facilitating oxidation or mediating deprotonation, as well the fate of the phenolic proton, is unclear. Here we present detailed structural models of Y and its environment using large-scale quantum mechanical models and all-atom molecular dynamics of a complete PSII monomer. The energetics of water distribution within a hydrophobic cavity adjacent to Y are shown to correlate directly with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) parameters such as the tyrosyl g-tensor, allowing us to map the correspondence between specific structural models and available experimental observations. EPR spectra obtained under different conditions are explained with respect to the mode of interaction of the proximal water with the tyrosyl radical and the position of the phenolic proton within the cavity. Our results revise previous models of the energetics and build a detailed view of the role of confined water in the oxidation and deprotonation of Y. Finally, the model of microsolvation developed in the present work rationalizes in a straightforward way the biphasic oxidation kinetics of Y, offering new structural insights regarding the function of the radical in biological photosynthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744153>Impact of Nitric Oxide (NO) on the ROS Metabolism of Peroxisomes.</a></h1><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous free radical endogenously generated in plant cells. Peroxisomes are cell organelles characterized by an active metabolism of reactive  species (ROS) and are also one of the main cellular sites of NO production in higher plants. In this mini-review, an updated and comprehensive overview is presented of the evidence available demonstrating that plant peroxisomes have the capacity to generate NO, and how this molecule and its derived products, peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻) and -nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), can modulate the ROS metabolism of peroxisomes, mainly throughout protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including -nitrosation and  nitration. Several peroxisomal antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR), have been demonstrated to be targets of NO-mediated PTMs. Accordingly, plant peroxisomes can be considered as a good example of the interconnection existing between ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), where NO exerts a regulatory function of ROS metabolism acting upstream of H₂O₂.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692572>Differential anti-tumour effects of MTH1 inhibitors in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures.</a></h1><p>Reactive  species (ROS) function as second messengers in signal transduction, but high ROS levels can also cause cell death. MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation - conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels - increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced  phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606204>Spironolactone suppresses aldosterone-induced Kv1.5 expression by attenuating mineralocorticoid receptor-Nox1/2/4-mediated ROS generation in neonatal rat atrial myocytes.</a></h1><p>Our previous investigation indicated that angiotensin II (Ang II) enhances the expression of Kv1.5, a promising target for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), by activating reactive  species (ROS)-dependent phosphorylation of Smad 2/3 (forming P-Smad 2/3) and ERK 1/2 (forming P-ERK 1/2). A recent study indicated that aldosterone (Aldo) upregulates atrial Kv1.5 protein in a rat AF model, but the mechanism remains unknown. The present study aimed to clarify the mechanism underlying Aldo-induced Kv1.5 expression and to test whether spironolactone may modulate atrial Kv1.5. Our Western blot analysis indicated that the Aldo/mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) interacts with Ang II/ATR in upregulating Kv1.5 expression in cultured neonatal atrial myocytes (NRAMs). Blockade of MR with spironolactone and of ATR with losartan significantly suppressed Kv1.5 expression induction by combined Aldo and Ang II treatment. Aldo increased the protein expression of Nox1, Nox2 and Nox4, but this effect was abolished by spironolactone pretreatment. The Aldo-induced upregulation of Kv1.5 was also reversed by the Src protein  kinase family inhibitor PP2, the Nox2 inhibitor gp91ds-tat and the Nox1/Nox4 inhibitor GKT137831 but not by the Rac GTPase inhibitor NSC23766. Flow cytometry showed that the Aldo-induced ROS production was inhibited by spironolactone, PP2, gp91ds-tat and GKT137831. Spironolactone suppressed the Aldo-induced protein expression phosphorylated Src (P-Src), P-Smad 2/3 and P-ERK 1/2. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that spironolactone suppresses Aldo-induced Kv1.5 expression by attenuating MR-Nox1/2/4-mediated ROS generation in NRAMs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The development of the root system is regulated by a complex and diverse signalling network, which besides hormonal factors, includes reactive  (ROS) - and nitrogen species (RNS). The delicate balance of the endogenous signal system can be affected by various environmental stimuli, such as the excess of essential heavy metals, like zinc (Zn). Zn at low concentration, is able to induce the morphological and physiological adaptation of the root system, but in excess it exerts toxic effects on plants. In this study the effect of a low, growth-inducing, and a high, growth inhibiting Zn concentrations on the early development of Brassica napus (L.) root architecture and the underlying nitro-oxidative mechanisms were studied in a soil-filled rhizotron system. The growth-inhibiting Zn treatment resulted in elevated protein  nitration due to the imbalance in ROS and RNS homeostasis, however its pattern was not changed compared to the control. This nitro-oxidative stress was accompanied by serious changes in the cell wall composition and decrease in the cell proliferation and viability, due to the high Zn uptake and disturbed microelement homeostasis in the root tips. During the positive root growth response, a  nitration-pattern reorganisation was observed; there were no substantial changes in ROS and RNS balance and the viability and proliferation of the root tips' meristematic zone decreased to a lesser extent, as a result of a lower Zn uptake. The obtained results suggest that Zn in different amounts triggers different root growth responses accompanied by distinct changes in the pattern and strength of  nitration, proposing that nitrosative processes have an important role in the stress-induced root growth responses.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, molecular mechanisms of how metformin promotes cellular differentiation have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated how metformin promotes cell differentiation, via an inhibition of cell proliferation, by culturing SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with or without metformin. Pretreatment with reactive  species (ROS) scavenger, NAC, revealed that ROS plays a crucial role in induction of cell differentiation. Cell differentiation was observed under various morphological criteria: extension of neuritic processes and neuronal differentiation markers. Treatment with metformin significantly increased neurite length, number of cells with neurite, and expression of neuronal differentiation markers, -tubulin III and  hydroxylase (TH) compared with untreated control. Further investigation found that metformin significantly decreased Cdk5 but increased Sox6 during cell differentiation. Analysis of the mechanism underlying these changes using Cdk5 inhibitor, roscovitine, indicated that expressions of Cdk5 and Sox6 corresponded to metformin treatment. These results suggested that metformin produces neuronal differentiation via Cdk5 and Sox6. In addition, phosphorylated Erk1/2 was decreased while phosphorylated Akt was increased in metformin treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that metformin promotes neuronal differentiation via ROS activation through Cdk5/Sox6 crosstalk, relating to Erk1/2 and Akt signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504723>Selenoprotein T Promotes Proliferation and G1-to-S Transition in SK-N-SH Cells: Implications in Parkinson's Disease.</a></h1><p>Selenium is prioritized to the brain mainly for selenoprotein expression. Selenoprotein T (SELENOT) protects dopaminergic, postmitotic neurons in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD).We hypothesized a proliferative role of SELENOT in neural cells.To assess SELENOT status in PD, sedated male C57BL/6 mice at 10-12 wk of age were injected with 6-hydroxydopamine in neurons, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 9 healthy subjects (56% men, 68-y-old) and 11 subjects with PD (64% men, 63-y-old). Dopaminergic neural progenitor-like SK-N-SH cells with transient SELENOT overexpression or knockdown were maintained in the presence or absence of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine and the calcium channel blocker nimodipine. Cell cycle, proliferation, and signaling parameters were determined by immunoblotting, qPCR, and flow cytometry.SELENOT mRNA abundance was increased (P < 0.05) in SK-N-SH cells treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (3.5-fold) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PD patients (1.6-fold). Likewise, SELENOT was expressed in  hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons of 6-hydroxydopamine-injected mice. Knockdown of SELENOT in SK-N-SH cells suppressed (54%; P < 0.05) 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation but induced (17-47%; P < 0.05) annexin V-positive cells, CASPASE-3 cleavage, and G1/S cell cycle arrest. SELENOT knockdown and overexpression increased (88-120%; P < 0.05) and reduced (37-42%; P < 0.05) both forkhead box O3 and p27, but reduced (51%; P < 0.05) and increased (1.2-fold; P < 0.05) cyclin-dependent kinase 4 protein abundance, respectively. These protein changes were diminished by nimodipine or N-acetyl-l-cysteine treatment (24 h) at steady-state levels. While the N-acetyl-l-cysteine treatment did not influence the reduction in the amount of calcium (13%; P < 0.05) by SELENOT knockdown, the nimodipine treatment reversed the decreased amount of reactive  species (33%; P < 0.05) by SELENOT overexpression.These cellular and mouse data link SELENOT to neural proliferation, expanding our understanding of selenium protection in PD.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755372>Inhibition of oncogenic Src induces FABP4-mediated lipolysis via PPARγ activation exerting cancer growth suppression.</a></h1><p>c-Src is a driver oncogene well-known for tumorigenic signaling, but little for metabolic function. Previous reports about c-Src regulation of glucose metabolism prompted us to investigate its function in other nutrient modulation, particularly in lipid metabolism.Oil-red O staining, cell growth assay, and tumor volume measurement were performed to determine lipid amount and growth inhibitory effect of treatments in lung cancer cells and xenograft model. Gene expression was evaluated by immunoblotting and relative RT-PCR. Transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) was assessed by luciferase assay. Reactive  species (ROS) was measured using ROS sensing dye.  consumption rate was evaluated by Seahorse XF Mito Stress Test. Clinical relevance of candidate proteins was examined using patient samples and public database analysis.Inhibition of Src induced lipolysis and increased intracellular ROS. Src inhibition derepressed PPARγ transcriptional activity leading to induced expression of lipolytic gene fatty acid binding protein (FABP) 4 which accompanies reduced lipid droplets and decreased tumor growth. The reverse correlation of Src and FABP4 was confirmed in pair-matched lung cancer patient samples, and further analysis using public datasets revealed upregulation of lipolytic genes is associated with better prognosis of cancer patients.This study provides an insight of how oncogenic factor Src concurrently regulates both cellular signaling pathways and metabolic plasticity to drive cancer progression.

Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration is mainly caused by long-term oxidative stress. Kinase activity could be either protective or detrimental to cells during oxidative stress; however, few reports have described the role of kinases in oxidative stress. In this study, high-throughput screening of kinome siRNA library revealed that erb-b2 receptor -protein kinase 2 (ERBB2) knockdown reduced reactive  species (ROS) production in ARPE-19 cells during oxidative stress. Silencing ERBB2 caused an elevation in microtubule associated protein light chain C3-II (MAP1LC3B-II/I) conversion and sequesterone (SQSTM)1 protein level. ERBB2 deprivation largely caused an increase in autophagy-regulating protease (ATG4B) expression, a protease that negatively recycles MAP1LC3-II at the fusion step between the autophagosome and lysosome, suggesting ERBB2 might modulate ATG4B for autophagy induction in oxidative stress-stimulated ARPE-19 cells. ERBB2 knockdown also caused an accumulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and enhanced its transcriptional activity. In addition, ERBB2 ablation or treatment with autophagy inhibitors reduced oxidative-induced cytotoxic effects in ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, ERBB2 silencing had little or no additive effects in ATG5/7-deficient cells. Taken together, our results suggest that ERBB2 may play an important role in modulating autophagic RPE cell death during oxidative stress, and ERBB2 may be a potential target in AMD prevention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373486>Peroxymonosulfate Oxidizes Amino Acids in Water without Activation.</a></h1><p>A variety of peptidic and proteinaceous contaminants (e.g., proteins, toxins, pathogens) present in the environment may pose risk to human health and wildlife. Peroxymonosulfate is a strong oxidant ( = 1.82 V for HSO, the predominant species at environmental pH values) that may hold promise for the deactivation of proteinaceous contaminants. Relatively little quantitative information exists on the rates of peroxymonosulfate reactions with free amino acids. Here, we studied the oxidation of 19 of the 20 standard proteinogenic amino acids (all except cysteine) by peroxymonosulfate without explicit activation. Reaction half-lives at pH 7 ranged from milliseconds to hours. Amino acids possessing sulfur-containing, heteroaromatic, or substituted aromatic side chains were the most susceptible to oxidation by peroxymonosulfate, with rates of transformation decreasing in the order methionine > tryptophan >  > histidine. The rate of tryptophan oxidation did not decrease in the presence of an aquatic natural organic matter. Singlet  resulting from peroxymonosulfate self-decomposition, while detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, was unlikely to be the principal reactive species. Our results demonstrate that peroxymonosulfate is capable of oxidizing 19 amino acids without explicit activation and that solvent-exposed methionine and tryptophan residues are likely initial targets of oxidation in peptides and proteins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30922130>Placental expression of angiogenesis-related genes and their receptors in IUGR pregnancies: correlation with fetoplacental and maternal parameters.</a></h1><p>Aberrations in placental vascular development compromising fetal supply of  and essential nutrients can be a significant contributor to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The development of placental vascular tree is under the influence of two families of growth factors, namely the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and angiopoietin/TEK family. In this study, we have examined the expression of angiogenesis-related growth factors, mainly VEGF family and angiopoietin-TEK (endothelial-specific receptor  kinase) family genes in placentae from IUGR pregnancies uncomplicated by preeclampsia (PE) compared to normal pregnancies.Placentae from normotensive IUGR (n = 42) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) pregnancies (n = 47) were collected and examined histologically. Clinical parameters were obtained from the medical records. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to assess placental transcript abundance of VEGF, PGF, FLT1, ANGPT1, ANGPT2, and TEK normalized to a panel of reference genes. Associations of placental transcript abundance of the genes with maternal, placental, and neonatal parameters were tested.Placental transcript abundance for VEGF (relative expression 10.81 versus 12.98, p < .001), PGF (12.14 versus 13.8, p < .001) and ANGPT2 (3.67 versus 9.55, p = .002) were significantly lower in IUGR placentae compared to AGA. The transcript level of VEGF showed significant negative correlation with birth weight (r = -0.419, p = .006), placental weight (r = -0.318, p = .040), placental length (r = -0.389, p = .011) and breadth (r = -0.308, p = .047) only in the IUGR group. Presence of histopathological features of hypoxia correlated with significantly higher transcript levels of PGF in IUGR placentae (12.6 versus 10.9, p = .046).The low levels of VEGF transcripts may be responsible for the impaired angiogenesis in IUGR placentae. The significance of higher relative expression of PGF in the presence of chronic hypoxia needs to be explored.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30984332>1-Trichloromethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline (TaClo) Induces the Apoptosis of Dopaminergic Neurons via Oxidative Stress and Neuroinflammation.</a></h1><p>Several  studies have revealed the neurotoxicity of 1-trichloromethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline (TaClo). However, the underlying mechanism has not been completely elucidated, particularly . This study was designed to study the neurotoxicity of TaClo  by stereotactically injecting TaClo into the striatum of Wistar rats. After the TaClo injections, rats were subjected to an open field test, and their distance travelled and tracks showed decreasing trends over time. The results of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that the motor dysfunction of the TaClo-treated rats was accompanied by reduced dopamine levels in the striatum. Based on the diffusion tensor imaging data, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the nigrostriatal pathway was significantly increased, and subsequent histological staining revealed the demyelination of nigrostriatal fibres after the TaClo treatment. TaClo induced a loss of  hydroxylase-positive cells in the substantia nigra compacta. Regarding the underlying mechanism, TaClo caused oxidative stress in the nigrostriatal system by increasing the production of reactive  species and reducing the mitochondria membrane potential. Meanwhile, the elevated expression of Iba-1, TNF-, IL-6, Cox-2, and iNOS indicated microglial activation and a strong innate immune response in the nigrostriatal system. In addition, activated caspase-3 levels were increased. Thus, both mitochondrial impairments and the innate immune response are involved in TaClo-induced neurotoxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666108>GSTZ1 deficiency promotes hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation via activation of the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway.</a></h1><p>Glutathione S-transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1) is the penultimate enzyme in phenylalanine/ catabolism. GSTZ1 is dysregulated in cancers; however, its role in tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the role of GSTZ1 in HCC and to reveal the underlying mechanisms, which may contribute to finding a potential therapeutic strategy against HCC.We first analyzed GSTZ1 expression levels in paired human HCC and adjacent normal tissue specimens and the prognostic effect of GSTZ1 on HCC patients. Thereafter, we evaluated the role of GSTZ1 in aerobic glycolysis in HCC cells on the basis of the  consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Furthermore, we assessed the effect of GSTZ1 on HCC proliferation, glutathione (GSH) concentration, levels of reactive  species (ROS), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling via gain- and loss- of GSTZ1 function in vitro. Moreover, we investigated the effect of GSTZ1 on diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl) induced hepatocarcinogenesis in a mouse model of HCC.GSTZ1 was downregulated in HCC, thus indicating a poor prognosis. GSTZ1 deficiency significantly promoted hepatoma cell proliferation and aerobic glycolysis in HCC cells. Moreover, loss of GSTZ1 function depleted GSH, increased ROS levels, and enhanced lipid peroxidation, thus activating the NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathway. Furthermore, Gstz1 knockout in mice promoted DEN/CCl-induced hepatocarcinogenesis via activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the antioxidant agent N-acetylcysteine and NRF2 inhibitor brusatol effectively suppressed the growth of Gstz1-knockout HepG2 cells and HCC progression in Gstz1 mice.GSTZ1 serves as a tumor suppressor in HCC. GSH depletion caused by GSTZ1 deficiency elevates oxidative stress, thus constitutively activating the NRF2 antioxidant response pathway and accelerating HCC progression. Targeting the NRF2 signaling pathway may be a promising therapeutic approach for this subset of HCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178179>Methylation of selected CpG islands involved in the transcription of myeloperoxidase and superoxide dismutase 2 in neutrophils of periparturient and mid-lactation cows.</a></h1><p>It is generally accepted that intracellular killing of microorganisms by production of reactive  species (ROS) in the phagosome of the neutrophil is an important arm of innate defense. High-producing dairy cows are prone to periparturient metabolic and infectious diseases. Both myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and ROS production decrease the day of parturition. Several studies have demonstrated changes in the expression of genes involved in, for example, metabolism and defense in the circulating neutrophil during peripartum. In this study, we wanted to further characterize the periparturient neutrophil in terms of its oxidative killing capacity by analyzing the oxidative burst at 3 levels. First, the ROS phenotype was evaluated using chemiluminescence. The cows (sampled within 24 h after parturition and at 135 d in milk) showed a significantly slower production of ROS at parturition. Both primiparous (n = 13) and multiparous (n = 12) cows were included in this study, but parity did not affect the kinetics of ROS production. Second, the expression of 11 genes involved in ROS production was measured in the same cows: cytochrome b-245 α and β chain (CYBA, CYBB; coding for membrane-bound constituents of NADPH oxidase); neutrophil cytosolic factors 1, 2, and 4 (NCF1, NCF2, and NCF4); Rac family small GTPase 1 and 2 (RAC1 and RAC2; coding for regulatory proteins of NADPH oxidase); superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2); catalase (CAT); myeloperoxidase (MPO; coding for enzymes involved in metabolizing downstream ROS); and spleen-associated  kinase (SYK; involved in signaling). During peripartum, a shift in expression in the oxidative killing pathway was observed, characterized by a downregulation of MPO and a simultaneous upregulation of the genes coding for NADPH oxidase. Third, as total DNA methylation is known to change during pregnancy, we investigated whether the observed differences were due to different methylation patterns. Promotor regions initiate transcription of particular genes; therefore, we analyzed the methylation status in annotated CpG islands of MPO and SOD2, 2 genes with a significant difference in expression between both lactation stages. The differences in methylation of these CpG islands were nonsignificant. High-throughput techniques may be necessary to obtain more detailed information on the total DNA methylation dynamics in bovine neutrophils and increase our understanding of how gene expression is controlled in neutrophils.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Photochemical properties of DTIC were characterized by UV-visible light spectral analysis, reactive  species (ROS) assay, and photostability testing. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted after intravenous administration of DTIC formulations (1 mg-DTIC/kg) to rats. DTIC exhibited strong absorption in the UVA range, and photoirradiated DTIC exhibited marked ROS generation. Thus, DTIC had high photoreactive potential. After exposure of DTIC (1 mM) to simulated sunlight (250 W/m) for 3 min, remaining DTIC and yielded Diazo-IC were estimated to be ca. 230 μM and 600 μM, respectively. The addition of radical scavenger (1 mM), including l-ascorbic acid, l-cysteine (Cys), l-histidine, D-mannitol, l-tryptophan, or , to DTIC (1 mM) could attenuate DTIC photoreactions, and in particular, the addition of Cys to DTIC brought ca. 34% and 86% inhibition of DTIC photodegradation and Diazo-IC photogeneration, respectively. There were no significant differences in the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters of DTIC between DTIC and DTIC with Cys (0.67 mg/kg). From these findings, the supplementary use of Cys would be an effective approach to improve the photostability of DTIC with less production of Diazo-IC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Immunoblotting analysis showed that Bombyx PGs contained a structural A subunit (A), a regulatory B subunit (B), and a catalytic C subunit (C), with each subunit undergoing development-specific changes. The protein levels of each subunit were not affected by PTTH treatment. However, the highly conserved  dephosphorylation of PP2A C subunit (PP2Ac), which appears to be related to activity, was increased by PTTH treatment in a time-dependent manner. We further demonstrated that phospholipase C (PLC), Ca, and reactive  species (ROS) are upstream signaling for the PTTH-stimulated dephosphorylation of PP2Ac. The determination of PP2A enzymatic activity showed that PP2A enzymatic activity was stimulated by PTTH treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Okadaic acid (OA), a specific PP2A inhibitor, prevented the PTTH-stimulated dephosphorylation of PP2Ac and reduced both basal and PTTH-stimulated PP2A enzymatic activity. The determination of ecdysteroid secretion showed that treatment with OA did not affect basal ecdysteroid secretion but did significantly inhibit PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroid secretion, indicating that PTTH-stimulated PP2A activity is involved in ecdysteroidogenesis. Treatment with OA stimulated the basal phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and 4E-binding protein (4E-BP) without affecting PTTH-stimulated ERK and 4E-BP phosphorylation. From these results, we hypothesize that PTTH-regulated PP2A signaling is a necessary component for the stimulation of ecdysteroidogenesis, potentially by mediating the link between ERK and TOR signaling pathways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We characterised the effects of nintedanib on physiologic outcomes using pooled data from the INPULSIS trials.Post-hoc analyses included changes in FVC over time, cumulative distribution of patients by change in FVC % predicted, and annual rate of decline in FVC in subgroups by diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) and composite physiologic index (CPI) at baseline. Changes from baseline in DLco and  saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO) were pre-specified.Nintedanib significantly reduced FVC decline versus placebo from week 12. A higher proportion of patients treated with nintedanib than placebo had an improvement or no decline in FVC % predicted, whereas a smaller proportion had absolute declines in FVC ≥5% or ≥10% predicted from baseline to week 52. The effect of nintedanib on FVC decline was similar in patients with baseline DLco >40% versus ≤40% predicted or CPI ≤45 versus >45. There were no significant differences between nintedanib and placebo in change from baseline in DLco % predicted, CPI, or SpO at week 52. However, change (deterioration) in CPI was significantly lower with nintedanib versus placebo in patients with CPI > 45 at baseline (1.0 versus 2.9) and CPI >55 at baseline (-1.2 versus 3.3).A range of physiologic outcome measures in the INPULSIS trials support the effect of nintedanib on reducing disease progression in patients with IPF.Copyright © 2018.

The results indicated that pre-ozonation efficiently mitigated membrane fouling of natural organic matter (NOM). The higher ozone doses were, the more the performance transmembrane pressures (TMPs) decreased. Ozone mainly converted macro molecule organics into low molecule organics. Macro molecular biopolymers (BP) can be removed up to 35.5% with an ozone treatment of 9 mg/L, while low molecular weight building blocks of acids and humics (BB) and neutrals (LMWN) increased 7.25% and 14.62%, respectively, with an ozone treatment of 9 mg/L. Analysis of fluorescence excitation emission matrices (EEMs) coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) indicated that ozone mainly removed soluble microbial organics and fulvic-like and humic-like organics but not  organics. Hydrophobic organics (HPO) were reduced with an increase of ozone doses, especially macro molecular BP and humic substances (HS), and the neutral hydrophilic fraction (N-HPI) was enhanced. Ozone treatment helped to reduce the interception of BP and HS in HPO and improved the interception of BP and HS in N-HPI, as well as BB and LMWN, in both fractions. Principal component analysis suggested that BP, as well as UV, had high correlations with a membrane fouling index, which can be used as the fouling indicator during ozone treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the inhibitory effect of  fruit extract (RFE) on allergic responses in calcium ionophore A23187-activated RBL-2H3 mast cells was investigated. The result showed that RFE was able to inhibit mast cell degranulation via decreasing -hexosaminidase release and intracellular Ca elevation at the concentration of 400 g/ml. Moreover, the suppressive effects of RFE on the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) were evidenced. In addition, RFE effectively scavenged DPPH radical and suppressed the reactive  species generation in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, the pretreatment of RFE caused the downregulation of  kinase Fyn phospholipid enzyme phospholipase C (PLC), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) phosphorylation.

Complex 2, a tyrosinase mimic, showed much higher activity in comparison to complex 1, and its reactivity was verified to be remarkably activated by UVB-light, while the mononuclear compound showed a small or negligible effect. Further, a significant dependence on the melanin content in the tumor cells, both from intrinsic pigmentation or stimulated by irradiation, was observed in the case of complex 2. Similar tests with keratinocytes and melanocytes indicated a much lower sensitivity to both copper (II) complexes, even after exposition to UV light. Clonogenic assays attested that the fractions of melanoma cells survival were much lower under treatment with complex 2 compared to complex 1, both with or without previous irradiation of the cells. The process also involves generation of reactive  species (ROS), as verified by EPR spectroscopy, and by using fluorescence indicators. Autophagic assays indicated a remarkable formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in melanomas treated with complex 2, while this effect was not observed in similar treatment with complex 1. Monitoring of specific protein LC3 corroborated the simultaneous occurrence of autophagy. A balance interplay between different modes of cell death, apoptosis and autophagy, occurs when melanomas were treated with the dinuclear complex 2, in contrast to the mononuclear complex 1.

Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) is a multiple-effects drug. Therefore, the potential molecular mechanisms underlying CCH and its feasible treatment should be investigated. This study had two main purposes: first, to identify a potential biomarker in a rat model of CCH induced VD using antibody microarrays; and second, to explore the neuroprotective role of NBP at targeting the potential biomarker. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)/GDNF family receptor alpha-1 (GFRα1)/receptor  kinase (Ret) signaling is altered in the hippocampus of CCH rats; however, NBP treatment improved cognitive function, protected against hippocampal neuron apoptosis  regulation of GDNF/GFRα1/Ret, and activated the phosphorylation AKT (p-AKT) and ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) signaling. We also found that 1 h -glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 48 h reperfusion (R) in cultured hippocampal neurons led to downregulation of GDNF/GFRα1/Ret. NBP upregulated the signaling and increased neuronal survival. Ret inhibitor (NVP-AST487) inhibits Ret and downstream effectors, including p-AKT and p-ERK1/2. Additionally, both GDNF and GFRα1 expression are markedly inhibited in hippocampal neurons by coincubation with NVP-AST487, particularly under conditions of OGD/R. GDNF/GFRα1/Ret signaling and neuronal viability can be maintained by NBP, which activates p-AKT and p-ERK1/2, increases expression of Bcl-2, and decreases expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3. The current study showed that GDNF/GFRα1/Ret signaling plays an essential role in the CCH induced VD. NBP was protective against hippocampal neuron apoptosis, and this was associated with regulation of GDNF/GFRα1/Ret and AKT/ERK1/2 signaling pathways, thus reducing cognitive impairment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30647407>Activation of c-Met in cancer cells mediates growth-promoting signals against oxidative stress through Nrf2-HO-1.</a></h1><p>Any imbalance between reactive  species (ROS) generation and the anti-oxidant capacity lead to cellular oxidative stress. Many chemotherapeutic agents mediate their cytotoxic functions through the generation of ROS. c-Met, a receptor  kinase, is over-expressed in renal cancer and plays very crucial role(s) in its growth and survival. Here, we show that c-Met activation protected renal cancer cells from ROS, oxidative stress and cytotoxicity induced by the anti-cancer agent sorafenib (used for renal cancer treatment); and it markedly attenuated sorafenib-induced DNA damage. Activated c-Met promoted the anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and inhibited apoptotic cleaved caspase-3. We found that the cytoprotective function of c-Met against sorafenib-induced ROS generation and apoptosis was mediated primarily through the activation of anti-oxidant Nrf2-HO-1. c-Met promoted the nuclear localization of Nrf2 and hindered its binding with the inhibitory protein Keap1. Silencing of Nrf2 attenuated the protective action of c-Met against sorafenib-induced oxidative stress. To evaluate the physiological significance of our findings, in a tumor xenograft model, we observed that a combination treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of c-Met and it's anti-oxidant downstream effecter HO-1 markedly reduced the growth of renal tumor in vivo; it increased the oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptotic markers in the tumor xenografts, along with reduced tumor vessel density. Our observations indicate that the c-Met-Nrf2-HO-1 pathway plays a vital role in relieving ROS-mediated oxidative stress of renal tumors. Targeting this pathway can significantly increase the oxidative stress to promote apoptotic death of cancer cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31185608>RTA 408 Inhibits Interleukin-1β-Induced MMP-9 Expression via Suppressing Protein Kinase-Dependent NF-κB and AP-1 Activation in Rat Brain Astrocytes.</a></h1><p>Neuroinflammation is characterized by the elevated expression of various inflammatory proteins, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), induced by various pro-inflammatory mediators, which play a critical role in neurodegenerative disorders. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has been shown to induce the upregulation of MMP-9 through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)-reactive  species (ROS)-dependent signaling pathways. N-(2-cyano-3,12-dioxo-28-noroleana-1,9(11)-dien-17-yl)-2-2-difluoropropanamide (RTA 408), a novel synthetic triterpenoid, has been shown to possess anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in various types of cells. Here, we evaluated the effects of RTA 408 on IL-1β-induced inflammatory responses by suppressing MMP-9 expression in a rat brain astrocyte (RBA-1) line. IL-1β-induced MMP-9 protein and mRNA expression, and promoter activity were attenuated by RTA 408. The increased level of ROS generation in RBA-1 cells exposed to IL-1β was attenuated by RTA 408, as determined by using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and CellROX. In addition, the inhibitory effects of RTA 408 on MMP-9 expression resulted from the suppression of the IL-1β-stimulated activation of Pyk2 (proline-rich  kinase), platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), Akt, ROS, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Pretreatment with RTA 408 attenuated the IL-1β-induced c-Jun phosphorylation, mRNA expression, and promoter activity. IL-1β-stimulated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 phosphorylation, translocation, and promoter activity were also attenuated by RTA 408. Furthermore, IL-1β-induced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) protein and mRNA expression, and cell migration were attenuated by pretreatment with RTA 408. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which RTA 408 attenuates IL-1β-mediated inflammatory responses and exerts beneficial effects for the management of brain diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058086>Sanguinarine Induces Apoptosis Pathway in Multiple Myeloma Cell Lines via Inhibition of the JaK2/STAT3 Signaling.</a></h1><p>Sanguinarine (SNG), a benzophenanthridine alkaloid, has displayed various anticancer abilities in several vivo and  studies. However, the anticancer potential of SNG is yet to be established in multiple myeloma (MM), a mostly incurable malignancy of plasma cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities of SNG in a panel of MM cell lines (U266, IM9, MM1S, and RPMI-8226). SNG treatment of MM cells resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability through mitochondrial membrane potential loss and activation of caspase 3, 9, and cleavage of PARP. Pre-treatment of MM cells with a universal caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, prevented SNG mediated loss of cell viability, apoptosis, and caspase activation, confirming that SNG-mediated apoptosis is caspase-dependent. The SNG-mediated apoptosis appears to be resulted from suppression of the constitutively active STAT3 with a concomitant increase in expression of protein  phosphatase (SHP-1). SNG treatment of MM cells leads to down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins including cyclin D, Bcl-2, Bclxl, and XIAP. In addition, it also upregulates pro-apoptotic protein, Bax. SNG mediated cellular DNA damage in MM cell lines by induction of oxidative stress through the generation of reactive  species and depletion of glutathione. Finally, the subtoxic concentration of SNG enhanced the cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs bortezomib (BTZ) by suppressing the viability of MM cells via induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis. Altogether our findings demonstrate that SNG induces mitochondrial and caspase-dependent apoptosis, generates oxidative stress, and suppresses MM cell lines proliferation. In addition, co-treatment of MM cell lines with sub-toxic doses of SNG and BTZ potentiated the cytotoxic activity. These results would suggest that SNG could be developed into therapeutic agent either alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs in MM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30917588>Evidence for Naturally Produced Beauvericins Containing -Methyl- in  Fungi.</a></h1><p>Beauvericin is a depsipeptide mycotoxin. The production of several beauvericin analogues has previously been shown among various genera among  fungi. This includes so-called beauvenniatins, in which one or more -methyl-phenylalanine residues is exchanged with other amino acids. In addition, a range of "unnatural" beauvericins has been prepared by a precursor addition to growth medium. Our aim was to get insight into the natural production of beauvericin analogues among different  fungi, such as  and  spp. In addition to beauvericin, we tentatively identified six earlier described analogues in the extracts; these were beauvericin A and/or its structural isomer beauvericin F, beauvericin C, beauvericin J, beauvericin D, and beauvenniatin A. Other analogues contained at least one additional  atom. We show that the additional  atom(s) were due to the presence of one to three -methyl- moieties in the depsipeptide molecules by using different liquid chromatography⁻mass spectrometry-based approaches. In addition, we also tentatively identified a beauvenniatin that contained -methyl-leucine, which we named beauvenniatin L. This compound has not been reported before.

Here, we investigated auraptene (AUR) as a potent therapeutic reagent that specifically protects neurotoxin-induced reduction of mitochondrial respiration and inhibits reactive  species (ROS) generation. Further, we explored the mechanism and potency of AUR in protecting dopaminergic neurons. Treatment with AUR significantly increased the viability of substantia nigra (SN)-derived SN4741 embryonic dopaminergic neuronal cells and reduced rotenone-induced mitochondrial ROS production. By inducing antioxidant enzymes AUR treatment also increased  consumption rate. These results indicate that AUR exerts a protective effect against rotenone-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage. We further assessed AUR effects in vivo, investigating  hydroxylase (TH) expression in the striatum and substantia nigra of MPTP-induced PD model mice and behavioral changes after injection of AUR. AUR treatment improved movement, consistent with the observed increase in the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. These results demonstrate that AUR targets dual pathogenic mechanisms, enhancing mitochondrial respiration and attenuating ROS production, suggesting that the preventative potential of this natural compound could lead to improvement in PD-related neurobiological changes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760494>Targeting Thioredoxin Reductase by Ibrutinib Promotes Apoptosis of SMMC-7721 Cells.</a></h1><p>Ibrutinib (IBT), the first-in-class inhibitor of Bruton's  kinase (BTK), has demonstrated clinical activity against various B-cell malignancies.

Here, the role of proline-rich  kinase 2 (Pyk2) in Trpm2 signaling is explored. Activation of Trpm2 in adult myocytes with H O resulted in 10- to 21-fold increases in Pyk2 phosphorylation in wild-type (WT) myocytes which was significantly lower (~40%) in Trpm2 knockout (KO) myocytes. Pyk2 phosphorylation was inhibited (~54%) by the Trpm2 blocker clotrimazole. Buffering Trpm2-mediated Ca increase with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) resulted in significantly reduced pPyk2 in WT but not in KO myocytes, indicating Ca influx through activated Trpm2 channels phosphorylated Pyk2. Part of phosphorylated Pyk2 translocated from cytosol to mitochondria which has been previously shown to augment mitochondrial Ca uptake and enhance adenosine triphosphate generation. Although Trpm2-mediated Ca influx phosphorylated Ca -calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII), the CaMKII inhibitor KN93 did not significantly affect Pyk2 phosphorylation in H O -treated WT myocytes. After ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), Pyk2 phosphorylation and its downstream prosurvival signaling molecules (pERK1/2 and pAkt) were significantly lower in KO-I/R when compared with WT-I/R hearts. After hypoxia/reoxygenation, mitochondrial membrane potential was lower and superoxide level was higher in KO myocytes, and were restored to WT values by the mitochondria-targeted superoxide scavenger MitoTempo. Our results suggested that Ca influx via tonically activated Trpm2 phosphorylated Pyk2, part of which translocated to mitochondria, resulting in better mitochondrial bioenergetics to maintain cardiac health. After I/R, Pyk2 activated prosurvival signaling molecules and prevented excessive increases in reactive  species, thereby affording protection from I/R injury.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706274>Role of PTP/PTK trans activated insulin-like signalling pathway in regulation of grasshopper (Oedaleus asiaticus) development.</a></h1><p>Protein  phosphatase (PTPs) and protein  kinase (PTKs) genes are responsible for the regulation of insect insulin-like pathway (ILP), cells growth, metabolism initiation, gene transcription and observing immune response. Signal transduction in insect cell is also associated with PTPs and PTKs. The grasshopper (Oedaleus asiaticus) 'Bey-Bienko' were treated with dsRNA of protein  non-receptor type 4 (PTPN4) and protein  kinase 5 (PTK5) along with control (water). Applying dsPTK5 treatments in 5th instar of Oedaleus asiaticus, significant reduction was recorded in body dry mass, growth rate and overall performance except survival rate. Whereas with PTPN4, no such significant impact on all of these growth parameters was recorded. Expression of genes in ILP 5th instar of Oedaleus asiaticus by the application of dsPTPN4 and dsPTK5 revealed that PTK, INSR (insulin receptor), IRS (insulin receptor substrate), PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), PDK (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase), Akt (protein kinase B) and FOXO (forkhead transcription factor) significantly expressed with downregulation except PTPN4, which remained non-significant. On the other hand, the phosphorylation level of ILP four proteins in O. asiaticus with the treatment of dsPTPN4 and dsPTK5 significantly affected P-IRS and P-FOXO, while P-INSR and P-AKT remained stable at the probability level of 5%. This indicated that the stress response in the O. asiaticus insulin-like signalling pathway (ILP) reduced. Regarding association of protective enzymatic activities, ROS (relative  species), CAT (catalase) and PO (phenol oxidase) increased significantly with exposure to dsPTK5 as compared to dsPTPN4 and control, while exposure of 5th instar of O. asiaticus to dsPTPN4 treatment slightly raised CAT and PO activities with but significant contribution. No such significant effect on MFO and POD was seen using dsPTPN4 and dsPTK5. This showed that in the ILP of O. asiaticus, PTK5 was detrimental to growth, body mass and overall performance, which ultimately benefited insect detoxification with high-energy cost.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585207>NADPH oxidase in the vasculature: Expression, regulation and signalling pathways; role in normal cardiovascular physiology and its dysregulation in hypertension.</a></h1><p>The last 20-25 years have seen an explosion of interest in the role of NADPH oxidase (NOX) in cardiovascular function and disease. In vascular smooth muscle and endothelium, NOX generates reactive  species (ROS) that act as second messengers, contributing to the control of normal vascular function. NOX activity is altered in response to a variety of stimuli, including G-protein coupled receptor agonists, growth-factors, perfusion pressure, flow and hypoxia. NOX-derived ROS are involved in smooth muscle constriction, endothelium-dependent relaxation and smooth muscle growth, proliferation and migration, thus contributing to the fine-tuning of blood flow, arterial wall thickness and vascular resistance. Through reversible oxidative modification of target proteins, ROS regulate the activity of protein  phosphatases, kinases, G proteins, ion channels, cytoskeletal proteins and transcription factors. There is now considerable, but somewhat contradictory evidence that NOX contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension through oxidative stress. Specific NOX isoforms have been implicated in endothelial dysfunction, hyper-contractility and vascular remodelling in various animal models of hypertension, pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension, but also have potential protective effects, particularly NOX4. This review explores the multiplicity of NOX function in the healthy vasculature and the evidence for and against targeting NOX for antihypertensive therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Genome-wide association studies, followed by functional studies, have identified a role for numerous autophagy genes in IBD, especially in Crohn disease. Studies using  and  models, in addition to human clinical studies have revealed that autophagy is pivotal for intestinal homeostasis maintenance, gut ecology regulation, appropriate intestinal immune responses and anti-microbial protection.

Aberrantly activated RET is found in several types of human cancer and is a target for treating RET aberration-associated cancer. Multiple clinically relevant RET protein- kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been identified, but how TKIs bind to RET is unknown except for vandetanib. Nintedanib is a RET TKI that inhibits the vandetanib-resistant RET(G810A) mutant. Here, we determined the X-ray co-crystal structure of RET kinase domain-nintedanib complex to 1.87 Å resolution and a RET(G810A) kinase domain crystal structure to 1.99 Å resolution. We also identified a vandetanib-resistant RET(L881V) mutation previously found in familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Drug-sensitivity profiling of RET(L881V) revealed that it remains sensitive to nintedanib. The RET-nintedanib co-crystal structure disclosed that Leu-730 in RET engages in hydrophobic interactions with the piperazine, anilino, and phenyl groups of nintedanib, providing a structural basis for explaining that the p.L730V mutation identified in nine independently isolated cell lines resistant to nintedanib. Comparisons of RET-nintedanib, RET(G810A), and RET-vandetanib crystal structures suggested that the solvent-front Ala-810 makes hydrophobic contacts with a methyl group and aniline in nintedanib and blocks water access to two  atoms of vandetanib, resulting in an energetic penalty for burying polar groups. Of note, even though the p.L881V mutation did not affect sensitivity to nintedanib, RET(L881V) was resistant to nintedanib analogs lacking a phenyl group. These results provide structural insights into resistance of RET mutants against the TKIs nintedanib and vandetanib.© 2019 Terzyan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31113864>RIP2 promotes FcγR-mediated reactive  species production.</a></h1><p>Receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) is a kinase that mediates signaling downstream of the bacterial peptidoglycan sensors NOD1 and NOD2. Genetic loss or pharmaceutical inhibition of RIP2 has been shown to be beneficial in multiple inflammatory disease models with the effects largely attributed to reducing proinflammatory signaling downstream of peptidoglycan recognition. However, given the widespread expression of this kinase and its reported interactions with numerous other proteins, it is possible that RIP2 may also function in roles outside of peptidoglycan sensing. In this work, we show that RIP2 undergoes  phosphorylation and activation in response to engagement of the Fc γ receptor (FcγR). Using bone marrow-derived macrophages from WT and RIP2-KO mice, we show that loss of RIP2 leads to deficient FcγR signaling and reactive  species (ROS) production upon FcγR cross-linking without affecting cytokine secretion, phagocytosis, or nitrate/nitrite production. The FcγR-induced ROS response was still dependent on NOD2, as macrophages deficient in this receptor showed similar defects. Mechanistically, we found that different members of the Src family kinases (SFKs) can promote RIP2  phosphorylation and activation. Altogether, our findings suggest that RIP2 is functionally important in pathways outside of bacterial peptidoglycan sensing and that involvement in such pathways may depend on the actions of SFKs. These findings will have important implications for future therapies designed to target this kinase.© 2019 Shehat et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31327004>Nitric oxide molecular targets: reprogramming plant development upon stress.</a></h1><p>Plants are sessile organisms that need to complete their life cycle by the integration of different abiotic and biotic environmental signals, tailoring developmental cues and defense concomitantly. Commonly, stress responses are detrimental to plant growth and, despite the fact that intensive efforts have been made to understand both plant development and defense separately, most of the molecular basis of this trade-off remains elusive. To cope with such a diverse range of processes, plants have developed several strategies including the precise balance of key plant growth and stress regulators [i.e. phytohormones, reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and reactive  species (ROS)]. Among RNS, nitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous gasotransmitter involved in redox homeostasis that regulates specific checkpoints to control the switch between development and stress, mainly by post-translational protein modifications comprising S-nitrosation of cysteine residues and metals, and nitration of  residues. In this review, we have sought to compile those known NO molecular targets able to balance the crossroads between plant development and stress, with special emphasis on the metabolism, perception, and signaling of the phytohormones abscisic acid and salicylic acid during abiotic and biotic stress responses.© The Author(s) 2019.

Herein, we demonstrate for -containing amino acid derivatives, peptides, and proteins that the selective oxidation of  to produce melanin or dityrosine can be readily realized by manipulating the  concentration in the reaction system. This -dependent pathway selection reflects the selective chemical evolution of  to dityrosine and melanin in anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms, respectively. The resulting melanin- and dityrosine-containing nanomaterials reproduce key functions of their natural counterparts with respect to their photothermal and photoluminescent characteristics, respectively. This work reveals the plausible role of  in the chemical evolution of  derivatives and provides a versatile strategy for the rational design of -based multifunctional biomaterials.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

SERCA2a is the predominant isoform in cardiac muscles and is inhibited by phospholamban (PLN). Under conditions of oxidative stress, SERCA2a may also be impaired by  nitration. Tafazzin (Taz) is a mitochondrial-specific transacylase that regulates mature cardiolipin (CL) formation, and its absence leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive production of reactive /nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). In the present study, we examined SERCA function, SERCA2a  nitration, and PLN expression/phosphorylation in left ventricles (LV) obtained from young (3-5 months) and old (10-12 months) wild-type (WT) and Taz knockdown (Taz ) male mice. These mice are a mouse model for Barth syndrome, which is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, excessive ROS/RNS production, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Here, we show that maximal SERCA activity was impaired in both young and old Taz LV, a result that correlated with elevated SERCA2a  nitration. In addition PLN protein was decreased, and its phosphorylation was increased in Taz LV compared with control, which suggests that PLN may not contribute to the impairments in SERCA function. These changes in expression and phosphorylation of PLN may be an adaptive response aimed to improve SERCA function in Taz mice. Nonetheless, we demonstrate for the first time that SERCA function is impaired in LVs obtained from young and old Taz mice likely due to elevated ROS/RNS production. Future studies should determine whether improving SERCA function can improve cardiac contractility and pathology in Taz mice.© 2019 The Authors.

Although FMS-like  kinase-3 (FLT3) plays a critical role in neuron survival, its function and molecular mechanism in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury is unclear. In the present study, we exposed SH-SY5Y cells to  and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to mimic ischemia/reperfusion injury. We found that FLT3 and MAPK14/p38α expression increased in OGD/R-treated cells. FLT3 silence significantly increased OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cell survival, inhibited reactive  species production. Also, we observed that FLT3 silence suppressed OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis, apoptosis related protein Bax level and caspase-3 activity was decreased and Bcl-2 expression was increased in FLT3 silence SH-SY5Y cell treated with OGD/R. Furthermore, FLT3 depletion induced MAPK14/p38α inhibition in SH-SY5Y cultures after OGD/R exposure. These findings suggest that MAPK14/p38α overexpression reverses the action of FLT3 silence in OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cells. They also provide the first evidence that FLT3 silence has a neuroprotective role in OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cell damage. These data provide insight about potential neuroprotective molecular for ischemia/reperfusion injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

They play incredibly diverse and important roles ranging from radiation protection to immune defense, camouflage, and virulence. Fungi have evolved to use melanin to be able to persist in the environment and within organisms. Fungal melanins are often located within the cell well and are able to neutralize reactive  species and other radicals, defend against UV radiation, bind and sequester non-specific peptides and compounds, and produce a physical barrier that defends the cell. For this reason, melanized fungi are often well-suited to be human pathogens-melanin allows fungi to neutralize the microbicidal oxidative bursts of our innate immune system, bind and inactivate to antimicrobial peptides and enzymes, sequester antifungal pharmaceuticals, and create a shield to block immune recognition of the fungus. Due to the importance and pervasiveness of melanin in fungal virulence, mammalian immune systems have evolved antifungal strategies that involve directly detecting and binding to fungal melanins. Such strategies include the use of melanin-specific antibody responses and C-type lectins like the newly discovered melanin-specific MelLec receptor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464373>High-fat diet in a mouse insulin-resistant model induces widespread rewiring of the phosphotyrosine signaling network.</a></h1><p>Obesity-associated type 2 diabetes and accompanying diseases have developed into a leading human health risk across industrialized and developing countries. The complex molecular underpinnings of how lipid overload and lipid metabolites lead to the deregulation of metabolic processes are incompletely understood. We assessed hepatic post-translational alterations in response to treatment of cells with saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids and the consumption of a high-fat diet by mice. These data revealed widespread  phosphorylation changes affecting a large number of enzymes involved in metabolic processes as well as canonical receptor-mediated signal transduction networks. Targeting two of the most prominently affected molecular features in our data, SRC-family kinase activity and elevated reactive  species, significantly abrogated the effects of saturated fat exposure in vitro and high-fat diet in vivo. In summary, we present a comprehensive view of diet-induced alterations of  signaling networks, including proteins involved in fundamental metabolic pathways.© 2019 The Authors.

Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation uses nontoxic dyes combined with harmless light to destroy microbial cells by reactive  species. Tetracyclines (demeclocycline and doxycycline) can act as light-activated antibiotics by binding to bacterial cells and killing them only upon illumination. The remaining tetracyclines can prevent bacterial regrowth after illumination has ceased. Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation can be potentiated by potassium iodide. Azide quenched the formation of iodine, but not hydrogen peroxide. Demeclotetracycline (but not doxycycline) iodinated  after light activation in the presence of potassium iodide. Bacteria are killed by photoactivation of tetracyclines in the absence of . Since topical tetracyclines are already used clinically, blue light activation may increase the bactericidal effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009803>Comparative proteomic analysis of two sesame genotypes with contrasting salinity tolerance in response to salt stress.</a></h1><p>Sesame is one of the most important oilseed crops and has high nutritional value. The yield and quality of sesame are severely affected by high salinity in coastal and semi-arid/arid regions. In this study, the phenotypic, physiological, and proteomic changes induced by salt treatment were analyzed in salt-tolerant (G441) and salt-sensitive (G358) seedlings. Phenotypic and physiological results indicated that G441 had an enhanced capacity to withstand salinity stress compared to G358. Proteomic analysis revealed a strong induction of salt-responsive protein species in sesame, mainly related to catalytic, hydrolase, oxidoreductase, and binding activities. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that more salt-responsive proteins in G441 were involved in  metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, carbon metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, photosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism. Furthermore, G441 displayed unique differentially accumulated proteins in seedlings functioning as heat shock proteins, abscisic acid receptor PYL2-like, calcium-dependent protein kinases, serine/threonine-protein phosphatases, nucleoredoxin, and antioxidant enzymes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that some of the proteins were also regulated by salinity stress at the transcript level. Our findings provide important information on salinity responses in plants and may constitute useful resources for enhancing salinity tolerance in sesame. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study identified potential biological pathways and salt-responsive protein species related to transducing stress signals and scavenging reactive  species under salt stress. These findings will provide possible participants/pathways/proteins that contribute to salt tolerance and may serve as the basis for improving salinity tolerance in sesame and other plants.Copyright © 2019.
