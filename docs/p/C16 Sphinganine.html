<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20110363>A critical role for ceramide synthase 2 in liver homeostasis: I. alterations in lipid  .</a></h2><p>Ceramide is an important lipid signaling molecule that plays critical roles in regulating cell behavior. Ceramide synthesis is surprisingly complex and is orchestrated by six mammalian ceramide synthases, each of which produces ceramides with restricted acyl chain lengths. We have generated a CerS2 null mouse and characterized the changes in the long chain base and sphingolipid composition of livers from these mice. Ceramide and downstream sphingolipids were devoid of very long (C22-C24) acyl chains, consistent with the substrate specificity of CerS2 toward acyl-CoAs. Unexpectedly, -ceramide levels were elevated, and as a result, total ceramide levels were unaltered; however, -ceramide synthesis in vitro was not increased. Levels of  were also significantly elevated, by up to 50-fold, reminiscent of the effect of the ceramide synthase inhibitor, fumonisin B1. With the exceptions of glucosylceramide synthase and neutral sphingomyelinase 2, none of the other enzymes tested in either the sphingolipid biosynthetic or degradative  were significantly changed. Total glycerophospholipid and cholesterol levels were unaltered, although there was a marked elevation in C18:1 and C18:2 fatty acids in phosphatidylethanolamine, concomitant with a reduction in C18:0 and C20:4 fatty acids. Finally, differences were observed in the biophysical properties of lipid extracts isolated from liver microsomes, with membranes from CerS2 null mice displaying higher membrane fluidity and showing morphological changes. Together, these results demonstrate novel modes of cross-talk and regulation between the various branches of lipid   upon inhibition of very long acyl chain ceramide synthesis.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22677645>Sphingolipid content of human adipose tissue: relationship to adiponectin and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Ceramides (Cer) are implicated in obesity-associated skeletal muscle and perhaps adipocyte insulin resistance. We examined whether the sphingolipid content of human subcutaneous adipose tissue and plasma varies by obesity and sex as well as the relationship between ceramide content and  indices. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose biopsies were performed on 12 lean adults (males = 6), 12 obese adults (males = 6) for measurement of sphingolipid content and activity of the main ceramide  enzymes. Blood was sampled for glucose, insulin (to calculate homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA(IR))) adiponectin, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations. Compared to lean controls, total ceramide content (pg/adipocyte) was increased by 31% (P < 0.05) and 34% (P < 0.05) in obese females and males, respectively. In adipocytes from obese adults sphingosine, , sphingosine-1-phosphate, C14-Cer, -Cer, and C24-Cer were all increased. C18:1-Cer was increased in obese males and C24:1-Cer in obese females. For women only, there was a negative correlation between -Cer ceramide and plasma adiponectin (r = -0.77, P = 0.003) and a positive correlation between total ceramide content and HOMA(IR) (r = 0.74, P = 0.006). For men only there were significant (at least P < 0.05), positive correlations between adipocyte Cer-containing saturated fatty acid and plasma IL-6 concentration. We conclude that the sexual dimorphism in adipose tissue behavior in humans extends to adipose tissue sphingolipid content its association with adiponectin, IL-6 and insulin resistance.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632963>Monitoring the Sphingolipid  Synthesis by Stable-Isotope Labeling and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Sphingolipids are a class of lipids that share a sphingoid base backbone. They exert various effects in eukaryotes, ranging from structural roles in plasma membranes to cellular signaling.  sphingolipid synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the condensation of the activated C fatty acid palmitoyl-CoA and the amino acid L-serine is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The product, 3-ketosphinganine, is then converted into more complex sphingolipids by additional ER-bound enzymes, resulting in the formation of ceramides. Since sphingolipid homeostasis is crucial to numerous cellular functions, improved assessment of sphingolipid  will be key to better understanding several human diseases. To date, no assay exists capable of monitoring  synthesis sphingolipid in its entirety. Here, we have established a cell-free assay utilizing rat liver microsomes containing all the enzymes necessary for bottom-up synthesis of ceramides. Following lipid extraction, we were able to track the different intermediates of the sphingolipid  pathway, namely 3-ketosphinganine, , dihydroceramide, and ceramide. This was achieved by chromatographic separation of sphingolipid metabolites followed by detection of their accurate mass and characteristic fragmentations through high-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem-mass spectrometry. We were able to distinguish, unequivocally, between  synthesized sphingolipids and intrinsic species, inevitably present in the microsome preparations, through the addition of stable isotope-labeled palmitate-d and L-serine-d. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a method monitoring the entirety of ER-associated sphingolipid biosynthesis. Proof-of-concept data was provided by modulating the levels of supplied cofactors (e.g., NADPH) or the addition of specific enzyme inhibitors (e.g., fumonisin B). The presented microsomal assay may serve as a useful tool for monitoring alterations in sphingolipid  synthesis in cells or tissues. Additionally, our methodology may be used for  studies of atypical substrates - naturally occurring or chemically tailored - as well as novel inhibitors of enzymes involved in sphingolipid  synthesis.Copyright © 2019 Wigger, Gulbins, Kleuser and Schumacher.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'fatty liver', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229635>Oral administration of fumonisin B and T-2 individually and in combination affects hepatic total and mitochondrial membrane lipid profile of rabbits.</a></h2><p>Weaned rabbits were fed diets contaminated with 2 mg/kg diet T-2 toxin alone, or 10 mg/kg diet fumonisin B (FB) alone, and both toxins in combination (2 + 10 mg/kg, respectively) compared to a toxin-free control diet.

Liver total phospholipids (PLs) provided slight alterations in the fatty acid (FA) composition; all three toxin-treated groups showed a decrease in palmitoleic acid (:1 n7) proportion. In the liver mitochondrial PL FA composition, margaric acid (C17:0) proportion decreased in the separated toxin treatments compared to the combined setting. Oleic acid (C18:1 n9) proportion was increased and arachidonic acid (C20:4 n6) was decreased in the FB-treated group, while docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 n3) was decreased in the separated treatments. The total monounsaturation was significantly higher in the FB group's mitochondrial PL FA profile.

This study aims to investigate whether or not quercetin can protect against DDVP-induced toxicity through metabonomics and to elucidate the mechanism underlying this protective effect. Rats were randomly assigned into the control group, DDVP-treated group, quercetin-treated group, and quercetin plus DDVP-treated group. DDVP and quercetin were administered to the rats daily via drinking water and gavage, respectively, continuously for 90 d. The metabonomic profiles of rat plasma were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Finally, 11 metabolites were identified, including those of quercetin, isorhamnetin, and quercetin-3-glucuronide. The 11 metabolites showed significant changes in some treatment groups compared with the control group. Arachidonic acid, phytosphingosine, and   significantly decreased while p-cresol, lysoPE (16:0/0:0), lysoPC (15:0/0:0), lysoPC (16:0/0:0), lysoPC (0:0/18:0), and tryptophan significantly increased in the DDVP-treated group compared with the control group. The tendency of the aforementioned metabolites to change was significantly ameliorated in the high-dose quercetin (50 mg per kg bw per day) plus DDVP-treated group compared with the DDVP-treated group. However, the levels of these metabolites in the high-dose quercetin plus DDVP-treated group were still significantly different from those in the control group. The results indicate that high-dose quercetin (50 mg per kg bw per day) elicits a partial protective effect on DDVP-induced toxicity. The histopathology of the liver tissues was consistent with the above results. Quercetin demonstrated regulatory effects on the  of lipids and amino acids, the antioxidant defense system, etc. Therefore, increasing the daily intake of quercetin can ameliorate the toxicity induced by chronic exposure to low-level DDVP residue in food and/or water.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8251488>Structural characterization of gangliosides from resting and endotoxin-stimulated murine B lymphocytes.</a></h2><p>B lymphocytes from CBA/J mice were stimulated in splenocyte cultures for 72 h with various endotoxins. Bisphosphoryl lipid A from Escherichia coli had the highest stimulatory effect followed by LPS of Citrobacter freundii and Salmonella minnesota as measured by [3H]thymidine uptake. Gangliosides of stimulated B cells (metabolically labeled with D-[1-14C]galactose and D-[1-14C]glucosamine) and unlabeled gangliosides from resting B cells (prepared from spleens without stimulus) were analyzed by high-performance TLC, DEAE anion-exchange HPLC, and immunostaining procedures. Contents of ganglioside-derived sialic acids, quantified by HPLC as their fluorescent derivatives, decreased from stimulated to resident B lymphocytes in the following order: LPS S. minnesota > LPS C. freundii > bisphosphoryl lipid A E. coli > resting B cells. Gangliosides of resting B cells contained more N-glycolyl- than N-acetylneuraminic acid, whereas inverse ratios were found in activated cells, indicating a shift from N-glycolyl- to N-acetylneuraminic acid due to stimulation. Furthermore, a higher disialoganglioside content was characteristic for activated B cells. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry was performed with permethylated mono- and disialoganglioside fractions of LPS S. minnesota and LPS C. freundii stimulated B cells. Major gangliosides were GM1a and GD1a beside minute amounts of GD1b. The structural heterogeneity in the gangliosides was caused by (a) N-substitution of the sialic acids with either acetyl or glycolyl groups, (b) variation in the long-chain base (sphingosine, ), and (c) substitution of the ceramide moiety by fatty acids of different chain length and degree of unsaturation (:0, C24:0,24:1).2+ p6.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11755184>Structure and antigenicity of the major glycolipid from Taenia solium cysticerci.</a></h2><p>Lipids were extracted from cysticerci of the human tapeworm Taenia solium isolated from various infected pigs and analysed by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. These consisted of both alkali-labile and alkali-stable glycolipids, and phosphorylated non-glycosylated lipids. Because abundant and immunogenic glycolipids of parasites have been implicated in host-parasite interactions, the major lipid, an alkali-stable glycolipid, was purified by chromatography and its structure and antigenicity were determined. The structure of the major glycolipid of T. solium, GSL-I, was elucidated through a combination of chemical degradative methods, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses of the degradative products, matrix-assisted-laser desorption/ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This analytical strategy led to the identification of a family of beta-galactosylceramides composed mainly of phytosphinganine (2-hydroxylated ) N-acylated by -C24 fatty acids, with the predominance of 2-hydroxylated homologues. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed no correlation between the antibody titres directed against GSL-I in the human sera and the infective status; in contrast, a very high specific immunoreactivity and a sensitivity above 50% were observed when GSL-I was tested with cerebrospinal fluids from well characterised infected humans. Thus, although these results do not support the use of GSL-I alone as an antigen for the detection of neurocysticercosis, its use as part of an antigen cocktail for the diagnosis of the disease in cerebrospinal fluids merits further investigations.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28511119>Effects of breviscapine on amyloid beta 1-42 induced Alzheimer's disease mice: A HPLC-QTOF-MS based plasma metabonomics study.</a></h2><p>Herba Erigerontis has long been used to cure apoplexy hemiplegia and precordial pain in China.

Unexpectedly, CerS2 null mice were resistant to acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. Although there were a number of biochemical changes in the liver, such as increased levels of glutathione and multiple drug-resistant protein 4, these effects are unlikely to account for the lack of acetaminophen toxicity. A number of other hepatotoxic agents, such as d-galactosamine, CCl4, and thioacetamide, were also ineffective in inducing liver damage. All of these drugs and chemicals require connexin (Cx) 32, a key gap junction protein, to induce hepatotoxicity. Cx32 was mislocalized to an intracellular location in hepatocytes from CerS2 null mice, which resulted in accelerated rates of its lysosomal degradation. This mislocalization resulted from the altered membrane properties of the CerS2 null mice, which was exemplified by the disruption of detergent-resistant membranes. The lack of acetaminophen toxicity and Cx32 mislocalization were reversed upon infection with recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing CerS2.

Sphingolipids (SLs) are important structural components of cellular membranes whose altered composition may affect K(Ca) 1.1 expression. Thus, in this study, we examined whether altered SL composition due to aging may affect the contractility of gastric smooth muscle (GSM). We studied changes in ceramide synthases (CerS) and SL levels in the GSM of mice of varying ages and compared them with those in young CerS2-null mice. The levels of - and C18-ceramides, , sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate were increased, and levels of C22, C24:1 and C24 ceramides were decreased in the GSM of both aged wild-type and young CerS2-null mice. The altered SL composition upregulated K(Ca) 1.1 and increased K(Ca) 1.1 currents, while no change was observed in K(Ca) 1.1 channel activity. The upregulation of KC a 1.1 impaired intracellular Ca²⁺mobilization and decreased phosphorylated myosin light chain levels, causing GSM contractile dysfunction. Additionally, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, protein kinase Cζ , c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and nuclear factor kappa-B were found to be involved in K(Ca) 1.1 upregulation. Our findings suggest that age-associated changes in SL composition or CerS2 ablation upregulate K(Ca) 1.1 via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase Cζ /c-Jun N-terminal kinases/nuclear factor kappa-B-mediated pathway and impair Ca²⁺ mobilization, which thereby induces the contractile dysfunction of GSM. CerS2-null mice exhibited similar effects to aged wild-type mice; therefore, CerS2-null mouse models may be utilized for investigating the pathogenesis of aging-associated motility disorders.© 2015 The Authors.

Three weeks old rats were fed with high-fat diet for 9 weeks to induce obesity prior to further induction of diabetes using alloxan (150 mg/kg body weight, i.p.). Blood glucose levels and body weight were measured every 7 days throughout the experiment. Glucose tolerance was assessed in normal and CF-treated rats on day 21. Terminal blood samples were collected from sacrificed animals for the measurement of serum insulin levels. Pancreases were excised from treated and untreated animals for histopathological examination.LCMS/MS chromatographic profile of CF via positive and negative modes revealed 13 and 23 compounds respectively.

As a result, significant changes were observed in the sphingolipid profile of livers from these mice, including elevated -ceramide and  levels. We now examine the functional consequences of these changes. CerS2 null mice develop severe nonzonal hepatopathy from about 30 days of age, the age at which CerS2 expression peaks in wild type mice, and display increased rates of hepatocyte apoptosis and proliferation. In older mice there is extensive and pronounced hepatocellular anisocytosis with widespread formation of nodules of regenerative hepatocellular hyperplasia. Progressive hepatomegaly and noninvasive hepatocellular carcinoma are also seen from approximately 10 months of age. Even though CerS2 is found at equally high mRNA levels in kidney and liver, there are no changes in renal function and no pathological changes in the kidney. High throughput analysis of RNA expression in liver revealed up-regulation of genes associated with cell cycle regulation, protein transport, cell-cell interactions and apoptosis, and down-regulation of genes associated with intermediary , such as lipid and steroid , adipocyte signaling, and amino acid . In addition, levels of the cell cycle regulator, the cyclin dependent-kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1), were highly elevated, which occurs by at least two mechanisms, one of which may involve p53.

Yet, its biosynthetic origin has long remained unknown. Here, we investigated in detail the biosynthesis of NPD in P. simplex soldiers. First, we track the dynamics in major   during soldier ontogeny, with emphasis on likely NPD precursors and intermediates. Second, we propose a hypothesis of NPD formation and verify its individual steps using in vivo incubations of putative precursors and intermediates. Third, we use a de novo assembled RNA-Seq profiles of workers and soldiers to identify putative enzymes underlying NPD formation. And fourth, we describe the caste- and age-specific expression dynamics of candidate initial genes of the proposed biosynthetic pathway. Our observations provide a strong support to the following biosynthetic scenario of NPD formation, representing an analogy of the sphingolipid pathway starting with the condensation of tetradecanoic acid with l-serine and leading to the formation of a C . The C  is then oxidized at the terminal carbon to give rise to 2-amino-3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, further oxidized to 2-amino-3-oxohexadecanoic acid. Subsequent decarboxylation yields 1-aminopentadecan-2-one, which then proceeds through six-electron oxidation of the amino moiety to give rise to 1-nitropentadecan-2-one. Keto group reduction and hydroxyl moiety elimination lead to NPD. The proposed biosynthetic sequence has been constructed from age-related quantitative dynamics of individual intermediates and confirmed by the detection of labeled products downstream of the administered labeled intermediates. Comparative RNA-Seq analyses followed by qRT-PCR validation identified orthologs of serine palmitoyltransferase and 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase genes as highly expressed in the NPD production site, i.e. the frontal gland of soldiers. A dramatic onset of expression of the two genes in the first days of soldier's life coincides with the start of NPD biosynthesis, giving further support to the proposed biosynthetic hypothesis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we show that γTE induced marked changes of sphingolipids including rapid elevation of dihydrosphingosine and dihydroceramides (dhCers) in various types of cancer cells. The elevation of dihydrosphingolipids coincided with increased cellular stress, as indicated by JNK phosphorylation, and was prior to any sign of induction of apoptosis. Chemically blocking de novo synthesis of sphingolipids partially counteracted γTE-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Experiments using C, N-labeled l-serine together with enzyme assays indicate that γTE inhibited cellular dihydroceramide desaturase (DEGS) activity without affecting its protein expression or de novo synthesis of sphingolipids. Unlike the effect on dhCers, γTE decreased ceramides (Cers) after 8-h treatment but increased C-Cer and C-Cer after 16 and 24 h, respectively. The increase of Cers coincides with γTE-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Since γTE inhibits DEGS and decreases de novo Cer synthesis, elevation of Cers during prolonged γTE treatment is likely caused by sphingomeylinase-mediated hydrolysis of sphingomyelin. This idea is supported by the observation that an acid sphingomeylinase inhibitor partially reversed γTE-induced cell death. Our study demonstrates that γTE altered sphingolipid  by inhibiting DEGS activity and possibly by activating SM hydrolysis during prolonged treatment in cancer cells.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Various N-acyl chain-containing ceramides or dihydroceramides were semi-synthesized as standard materials and allowed to react with anthroyl cyanide, a fluorescent reagent. Anthroyl derivatives of ceramide and dihydroceramide containing , C18, C20, C22, and C24 saturated N-acyl chain could be completely separated to each molecular species by reversed-phase HPLC equipped with fluorescence detector, although some ceramide molecular species containing monoenoic acyl chain were eluted together with saturated dihydroceramide species. Ceramide molecular species could be quantified using N-heptadecanoyl or N-tricosanoyl sphingosine as an internal standard, and the lower detection limit was below 1 pmol. This method was applied to the analysis of sphingomyelin and free ceramide in U937 cells. The analysis of the ceramide obtained by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin of U937 cells revealed that the ceramide moiety was mainly composed of N-palmitoyl sphingosine, N-nervonoyl sphingosine, and N-lignoceroyl sphingosine, representing 50.0, 27.4, and 6.7% of sphingomyelin, respectively. The total free ceramide and dihydroceramide of U937 cells was determined to be 254 +/- 5 pmol/10(6) cells. Major molecular species of the free ceramide fraction were N-lignoceroyl, N-palmitoyl, and N-nerovonoyl sphingosine, representing 27.6%, 26.6%, and 13.6% of this fraction, respectively. Different distribution of free ceramide molecular species from sphingomyelin species may suggest that selective  of molecular species occurs in the synthesis or degradation of sphingomyelin. These results indicate that the picomole level of molecular species of ceramide and dihydroceramide is successfully determined by fluorescence HPLC and that this newly developed method may be useful to reveal the  and function of ceramide and related compounds in cultured cells.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802275>Sphingosine induces the aggregation of imine-containing peroxidized vesicles.</a></h2><p>Lipid peroxidation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of many diseases like atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis. We have analyzed the interaction of sphingosine with peroxidized bilayers in model membranes. Cu(2+) induced peroxidation was checked following UV absorbance at 245nm, and also using the novel Avanti snoopers®. Mass spectrometry confirms the oxidation of phospholipid unsaturated chains. Our results show that sphingosine causes aggregation of Cu(2+)-peroxidized vesicles. We observed that aggregation is facilitated by the presence of negatively-charged phospholipids in the membrane, and inhibited by anti-oxidants e.g. BHT. Interestingly, long-chain alkylamines (C18, ) but not their short-chain analogues (C10, C6, C1) can substitute sphingosine as promoters of vesicle aggregation. Furthermore,  but not sphingosine-1-phosphate can mimic this effect. Formation of imines in the membrane upon peroxidation was detected by (1)H-NMR and it appeared to be necessary for the aggregation effect. (31)P-NMR spectroscopy reveals that sphingosine facilitates formation of non-lamellar phase in parallel with vesicle aggregation.

In the current study we assessed via mass spectrometry serum concentrations of sphingolipid metabolites in a series of 122 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to an age- and sex-matched series of 127 patients with cirrhosis. We observed a highly significant upregulation of long and very long chain ceramides (-C24) in the serum of patients with HCC as compared to patients with cirrhosis (P < 0.001). Accordingly, dihydro-ceramides, synthetic precursors of ceramides and notably sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and -1-phosphate (SA1P) were upregulated in patients with HCC (P < 0.001). Especially the diagnostic accuracy of -ceramide and S1P, assessed by receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis, showed a higher area under the curve (AUC) value as compared to alpha fetoprotein (AFP) (0.999 and 0.985 versus 0.823, P < 0.001 respectively). In conclusion, serum levels of sphingolipid metabolites show a significant upregulation in patients with HCC as compared to patients with cirrhosis.

In Jurkat cells PDT-triggered ROS production or mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi(m)) loss was not prevented by the de novo sphingolipid synthesis inhibitor ISP-1. However, PDT + -ceramide led to enhanced mitochondrial depolarization and DEVDase activation. The superoxide dismutase mimic manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) protected Jurkat cells from ROS generation and apoptosis, but not from deltapsi(m) reduction.  or -ceramide counteracted MnTBAP-induced protection from apoptosis in Jurkat, as well as CHO cells.

However, the functions of Cer accumulation in necrotic cell death remain unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between Cer accumulation with inhibition of the conversion pathway of Cer and concomitant necrotic cell death. In order to minimize the effect of apoptosis against necrotic cell death, A549 cells having the inhibiting effect of caspase 9 by survivin were used in this study. Consequently, Cer accumulation in A549 cells would likely be associated with a pathway other than the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway of apoptosis. Here, we showed that the dual addition of a glucosyl-Cer synthase inhibitor and a ceramidase inhibitor to A549 cell culture induced palmitoyl-Cer accumulation with Cer synthase 5 expression and necrotic cell death with lysosomal rupture together with leakage of cathepsin B/alkalization after 2-3 h, although it is unknown in this study whether the necrotic cell death was caused by the lysosomal rupture. This Cer accumulation was followed by a steep increase in  base levels via the activation of serine palmitoyltransferase activity brought about by the increase in palmitoyl-coenzyme A concentration as a substrate after 5-6 h. The increase in palmitoyl-coenzyme A concentration was achieved by activation of the fatty acid synthetic pathway from acetyl coenzyme A.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18400538>Modulation of total ceramide and constituent ceramide species in the acutely and chronically hypoxic mouse heart at different ages.</a></h2><p>Ceramide has been implicated in regulatory processes vital for cell survival under different stressors, most notably hypoxia. Little has been done to investigate the contributions of the different ceramide species to the regulation of cell survival. This study aims to highlight the patterns of variation in total ceramide and its species in the growing and hypoxic mouse heart. Mus musculus mice were placed in a hypoxic environment at birth. Control animals remained in room air. The hearts were extracted at different time points: 1 day, 1 week, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. The total ceramide content and the amounts of component species were assayed by a modified diacylglycerol kinase assay and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy, respectively. Data was collected from both ventricles in hypoxic and control conditions. There was significant polycythemia in the hypoxic versus control animals with a nearly twofold increase in hematocrit levels. Hypoxic right ventricle (RV) mass significantly increased over that of controls at different age groups. When ceramide content was compared in the hypoxic versus control animals, there was a significant increase at day 1 and a significant decrease at week 4 in the left ventricle, whereas a significant decrease was found in the RV at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. There was also a differential involvement of the RV with regard to levels of N-palmitoyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (-Cer) and its synthetic precursor dihydro-N-palmitoyl-D-erythro- (DHC-16-Cer). The decrease in -Cer observed in both hypoxic and control RV's over time was paralleled by a significant increase in DHC-16-Cer in hypoxic (142.1+/-15.0 pmol; p<0.05) but not control (52.8+/-4.0 pmol) RV's suggesting a role for DHC-16-Cer in the RV adaptive response to hypoxia. Another species, N-arachidoyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (C20-Cer), was specifically and significantly decreased in the hypoxic RV.

While proteomic and transcriptomic analyses have been utilized to probe and characterize pancreatic tumors, lipidomic analyses have not been applied to identify perturbations in pancreatic cancer patient samples. Thus, we utilized a mass spectrometry-based lipidomic approach, focused towards the sphingolipid class of lipids, to quantify changes in human pancreatic cancer tumor and plasma specimens. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with positive lymph node metastasis have a markedly higher level of ceramide species (:0 and C24:1) in their tumor specimens compared to pancreatic cancer patients without nodal disease or to patients with pancreatitis. Also of interest, ceramide metabolites, including phosphorylated (sphingosine- and -1-phosphate) and glycosylated (cerebroside) species were elevated in the plasma, but not the pancreas, of pancreatic cancer patients with nodal disease. Analysis of plasma level of cytokine and growth factors revealed that IL-6, IL-8, CCL11 (eotaxin), EGF and IP10 (interferon inducible protein 10, CXCL10) were elevated in patients with positive lymph nodes metastasis, but that only IP10 and EGF directly correlated with several sphingolipid changes.

It was less potently inhibited by D-erythro- (D-e-dh-Sph, IC50 0.20 mol %), D-erythro-dehydro sphingosine (D-e-deh-Sph, IC50 0.25 mol %), (2S)-3-keto- (3-keto-dh-Sph, IC50 0.34 mol %), (2S) 3-keto-ceramide (3-keto--Cer, IC50 0.60 mol %), and ceramine (C18-ceramine, IC50 0.62 mol %), 1-O-methyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (1-O-Me-Sph), cis-D-erythro-sphingosine (cis-D-e-Sph), (2S)-3-ketosphingosine (3-keto-Sph), (2S)-3-keto-dehyrosphingosine (3-keto-deh-Sph), and N,N-dimethyl-D-erythrosphingosine (N,N-diMe-Sph) were weak inhibitors whereas ceramide-1-phosphate (Cer-1-P) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (Sph-1-P) stimulated the enzyme. Thus, for inhibition, the enzyme requires the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups, the C4-C5 double bond, the trans configuration of this double bond, and the NH-protons from either the amide of ceramide or the amine of sphingosine. Therefore, these results provide important information on the requirements for ceramide-enzyme interaction, and they suggest that ligand interaction with the enzyme occurs in a high affinity low specificity manner, in contrast to catalysis which is highly specific for D-erythro-ceramide (D-e-Cer) but occurs with a lower affinity. In addition, this study identifies two competitive inhibitors of mt-CDase; urea-ceramide (-urea-Cer) and ceramine (C18-ceramine) that may be further developed and used to understand the mechanism of mt-CDase in vitro and in biologic responses.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29262505>[Discrimination and clinical value of plasma metabolomic profiles in multidrug resistant epithelial ovarian cancer].</a></h2><p> To explore the alteration of plasma metabolomic profiles, screen the new serum markers of multidrug resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and investigate the mechanism.  The serum of 132 cases with cisplatin-resistant EOC, cisplatin-sensitive EOC, benign ovarian cyst and healthy donors were collected. Differentially plasma  profiles were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The significantly different metabolites of each group were screened by using principal component analysis. Then compounds that played a key role in cisplatin resistance were identified by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The relationships between these compounds and clinical characteristics and prognosis were analyzed.  LC-MS/MS identified 25 800  compounds. According to the descending dimension algorithm by principal component analysis, six compounds which were the biggest contributor to grouping were identified. The identified results of NMR showed that the serum level of   was lower while Dodemorph was higher in the EOC than those of the normal control. Compared to the cisplatin sensitive group, cisplatin resistant group exhibited a specific  trait characterized by upregulation of 1-Monopalmitin, Ricinoleic acid methyl ester, Polyoxyethylene (600) mono-ricinoleate/Glycidyl stearate and downregulation of Calycanthidine. The four components were all associated with fatty acid , and the combinational diagnostic sensitivity of these biomarkers for cisplatin-resistance was 86.50% and the specificity was 81.80%, the area of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.93.  The  signatures of normal control, benign ovarian cyst, cisplatin sensitivity and cisplatin resistance can be clearly separated from each other by LC-MS/MS technology.The combinational four biomarkers including Calycanthidine, 1-Monopalmitin, Ricinoleic acid methl ester and Polyoxyethylene (600) mono-ricinoleate/Glycidyl stearate are more sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of cisplatin resistant EOC, and may provide the potentially predict markers of chemotherapeutic response in  level. The fatty acid  may participate in the cisplatin resistant progression of EOC.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p></html>
