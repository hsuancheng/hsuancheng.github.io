<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531187> Suppresses Breast Cancer Metastasis by Targeting GRP78-Mediated Glycolysis and ER Stress Apoptotic Pathway.</a></h1><p>Targeting aberrant metabolism is a promising strategy for inhibiting cancer growth and metastasis. Research is now geared towards investigating the inhibition of glycolysis for anticancer drug development.  (BA) has demonstrated potent anticancer activities in multiple malignancies. However, its regulatory effects on glycolysis and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. BA inhibited invasion and migration of highly aggressive breast cancer cells. Moreover, BA could suppress aerobic glycolysis of breast cancer cells presenting as a reduction of lactate production, quiescent energy phenotype transition, and downregulation of aerobic glycolysis-related proteins. In this study, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) was also identified as the molecular target of BA in inhibiting aerobic glycolysis. BA treatment led to GRP78 overexpression, and GRP78 knockdown abrogated the inhibitory effect of BA on glycolysis. Further studies demonstrated that overexpressed GRP78 activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor PERK. Subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2 led to the inhibition of -catenin expression, which resulted in the inhibition of c-Myc-mediated glycolysis. Coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that BA interrupted the binding between GRP78 and PERK, thereby initiating the glycolysis inhibition cascade. Finally, the lung  model validated that BA inhibited breast cancer metastasis , as well as suppressed the expression of aerobic glycolysis-related proteins. In conclusion, our study not only provided a promising drug for aerobic glycolysis inhibition but also revealed that GRP78 is a novel molecular link between glycolytic metabolism and ER stress during tumor metastasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25531780>Glycolytic switch in response to  in non-cancer cells.</a></h1><p>The naturally occurring triterpenoid  (BA) shows pronounced polypharmacology ranging from anti-inflammatory to anti-lipogenic activities. Recent evidence suggests that rather diverse cellular signaling events may be attributed to the same common upstream switch in cellular metabolism. In this study we therefore examined the metabolic changes induced by BA (10 µM) administration, with focus on cellular glucose metabolism. We demonstrate that BA elevates the rates of cellular glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with concomitant reduction of glucose oxidation. Without eliciting signs of obvious cell death BA leads to compromised mitochondrial function, increased expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1 and 2, and liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-dependent activation AMP-activated protein kinase. AMPK activation accounts for the increased glucose uptake and glycolysis which in turn are indispensable for cell viability upon BA treatment. Overall, we show for the first time a significant impact of BA on cellular bioenergetics which may be a central mediator of the pleiotropic actions of BA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15659823>Mitochondria of human spermatozoa are preferentially susceptible to apoptosis.</a></h1><p>Although elements of type I and II apoptosis have been demonstrated in human spermatozoa, their functionality has not been evaluated. The first dynamic studies revealed no type I apoptosis signal transduction via CD95. The aim of our study was to clarify whether type II apoptosis can be induced in human spermatozoa. , a cytotoxic agent and highly specific inductor of type II apoptosis, acts by a direct effect on mitochondria. Motility, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and active caspase-9 and -3 were examined in human ejaculated spermatozoa of 33 semen samples from healthy volunteers after incubation with 60 microg/mL  for 10 and 60 min, respectively. Untreated aliquots of each sample served as negative controls. Treatment with  resulted in the induction of type II apoptosis measured by disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and activation of caspase-9 and -3. The loss of mitochondrial  supply resulted in a significant decrease of spermatozoal motility and velocity. In spermatozoa, mitochondria are tightly packed and located exclusively in the midpiece region. This might contribute to their susceptibility against the induction of type II apoptosis and should be considered for therapeutic interventions and might have a future in the development of advanced birth control methods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28393690>Hepatic AMP Kinase as a Potential Target for Treating Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Evidence from Studies of Natural Products.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common chronic liver disease, is the leading cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis and has consistently been implicated in related metabolic disorders, such as dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains to be elucidated, and no established therapeutic regimens for treating NAFLD exist. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the main cellular energy sensor, has been implicated as a key regulator of hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism. Recently, emerging evidence indicates that many plant-derived natural products are capable of ameliorating NAFLD by targeting AMPK.The published literature in PubMed relating to this topic was searched through June 2016.Significant advances have been made with respect to understanding the protective effects of plant-derived natural products against NAFLD. A variety of natural products, including alkaloids (berberine, demethyleneberberine, nicotine, caffeine, etc.), polyphenols (resveratrol, puerarin, curcumin, caffeic acid, etc.) and other compounds (β- caryophyllene, gastrodin, compound K, , etc.), have demonstrated promising results in preclinical studies. Mechanistic studies of these compounds have focused on their activation of AMPK and its downstream effectors involved in lipid metabolism.The findings of this review confirm that plant-derived natural products capable of activating the AMPK signaling pathway are potential therapeutic agents for NAFLD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27593449>Evaluation of seasonal changes of triterpenic acid contents in Viscum album from different host trees.</a></h1><p>Viscum album L. (Loranthaceae) is a semi-parasitic plant used in pharmacy and medicine mostly for its hypotensive and anticancer activity. The effects may be related to the presence of triterpenic acids, such as betulinic (BA) and oleanolic (OA) acids.In our investigations the content of triterpenic acids in V. album from different host trees depending on the season of harvest was determined.V. album herb was dried and extracted with ethyl acetate using ultrasound energy. The reversed phase HPLC-PDA method was used for the analysis of triterpenic acids. The structure of the target components was confirmed by mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionization source.Diversity in the content of both compounds was noted; however, OA was the dominant triterpenic acid and the amount thereof was ∼10 times higher than that of BA. The analysis of changes in the amount of triterpenic acids during the spring-winter period revealed the highest content of OA in summer (from 6.84 to 13.65 mg/g). In turn, in the other seasons of harvest, the content was in the range of 4.41-9.83, 6.41-9.56 and 5.59-12.16 mg/g for spring, autumn and winter, respectively. In most cases, a similar tendency was observed for BA.In most cases, the highest amount of the investigated compounds was found in summer; thus, this period seems to be optimal for acquisition of plant material rich in triterpenic acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30909900>In vitro evaluation of the α-glucosidase inhibitory potential of methanolic extracts of traditionally used antidiabetic plants.</a></h1><p>Different plant parts of Roylea cinerea (D. Don) Baill. (Lamiaceae), Clematis grata Wall. (Ranunculaceae), Cornus capitata Wall. (Cornaceae) are traditionally used in the management of diabetes and various other diseases.The air-dried plant parts from different plants were coarsely powdered and macerated in methanol to obtain their crude extracts. The crude extracts were evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. On the basis of results obtained, the methanolic crude extract of Cornus capitata Wall. was further sequentially fractionated in hexane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol. Fractions obtained were also evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory potential. The kinetic study was performed using Lineweaver Burk plot to evaluate the type of inhibition. Furthermore, in silico analysis was also carried with active sites of the enzyme (PDB ID: 3WY1) using Autodock4.Among all the plant extracts, Cornus capitata extract showed maximum inhibitory activity. Therefore its methanolic extract was further fractionated with the help of different solvents and the maximum activity was shown by the ethyl acetate fraction (IC 50 μg/mL). Kinetic analysis indicated that Vmax and Km were increased indicating a competitive type of inhibition. In docking studies, among different constituents known in this plant,  showed minimum binding energy (- 10.21 kcal/mol). The kinetic and docking studies have strengthened the observation made in the present study regarding the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of Cornus capitata.The study provided partial evidence for pharmacological basis regarding clinical applications of Cornus capitata in the treatment of diabetes suggesting it to be a suitable candidate for the treatment of postprandial hyperglycemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26865097>Selective binding modes and allosteric inhibitory effects of lupane triterpenes on protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B.</a></h1><p>Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has been recognized as a promising therapeutic target for treating obesity, diabetes, and certain cancers for over a decade. Previous drug design has focused on inhibitors targeting the active site of PTP1B. However, this has not been successful because the active site is positively charged and conserved among the protein tyrosine phosphatases. Therefore, it is important to develop PTP1B inhibitors with alternative inhibitory strategies. Using computational studies including molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free energy calculations, we found that lupane triterpenes selectively inhibited PTP1B by targeting its more hydrophobic and less conserved allosteric site. These findings were verified using two enzymatic assays. Furthermore, the cell culture studies showed that lupeol and  inhibited the PTP1B activity stimulated by TNFα in neurons. Our study indicates that lupane triterpenes are selective PTP1B allosteric inhibitors with significant potential for treating those diseases with elevated PTP1B activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24966522>Molecular modeling of Ruellia tuberosa L compounds as a-amylase inhibitor: an in silico comparation between human and rat enzyme model.</a></h1><p>Inhibition of α-amylase is an important strategy to control post-prandial hyperglycemia. The present study on Ruellia tuberosa, known as traditional anti-diabetic agent, is being provided in silico study to identify compounds inhibiting α-amylase in rat and human. Compounds were explored from PubChem database. Molecular docking was studied using the autodock4. The interactions were further visualized and analyzed using the Accelrys Discovery Studio version 3.5. Binding  of compounds to α-amylase was varying between -1.92 to -6.66 kcal/mol in rat pancreatic alpha amylase and -3.06 to -8.42kcal/mol in human pancreatic alpha amylase, and inhibition konstanta (ki) was varying between 13.12- 39460µM in rat and 0.67-5600µM in human. The docking results verify that betulin is the most potential inhibitor of all towards rat model alpha amylase and human alpha amylase. Further analysis reveals that betulin could be a potential inhibitor with non-competitive pattern like . In comparison, betulin has smaller Ki (0.67µM) than acarbose (2.6 µM), which suggesting that betulin is more potential as inhibitor than acarbose, but this assumption must be verified in vitro.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25187683>Virtual screening of natural inhibitors to the predicted HBx protein structure of Hepatitis B Virus using molecular docking for identification of potential lead molecules for liver cancer.</a></h1><p>The HBx protein in Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a potential target for anti-liver cancer molecules. Therefore, it is of interest to screen known natural compounds against the HBx protein using molecular docking. However, the structure of HBx is not yet known. Therefore, the predicted structure of HBx using threading in LOMET was used for docking against plant derived natural compounds (curcumin, oleanolic acid, resveratrol, bilobetin, luteoline, ellagic acid,  and rutin) by Molegro Virtual Docker. The screening identified rutin with binding  of -161.65 Kcal/mol. Thus, twenty derivatives of rutin were further designed and screened against HBx. These in silico experiments identified compounds rutin01 (-163.16 Kcal/mol) and rutin08 (- 165.76 Kcal/mol) for further consideration and downstream validation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213701>Ursolic acid-mediated changes in glycolytic pathway promote cytotoxic autophagy and apoptosis in phenotypically different breast cancer cells.</a></h1><p>Plant-derived pentacyclic triterpenotids with multiple biological activities are considered as promising candidates for cancer therapy and prevention. However, their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. In the present study, we have analyzed the effects of low dose treatment (5-20 µM) of ursolic acid (UA) and  (BA) on breast cancer cells of different receptor status, namely MCF-7 (ER, PR, HER2), MDA-MB-231 (ER, PR, HER2) and SK-BR-3 (ER, PR, HER2). UA-mediated response was more potent than BA-mediated response. Triterpenotids (5-10 µM) caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, an increase in p21 levels and SA-beta-galactosidase staining that was accompanied by oxidative stress and DNA damage. UA (20 µM) also diminished AKT signaling that affected glycolysis as judged by decreased levels of HK2, PKM2, ATP and lactate. UA-induced energy stress activated AMPK that resulted in cytotoxic autophagy and apoptosis. UA-mediated elevation in nitric oxide levels and ATM activation may also account for AMPK activation-mediated cytotoxic response. Moreover, UA-promoted apoptosis was associated with decreased pERK1/2 signals and the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, we have shown for the first time that UA at low micromolar range may promote its anticancer action by targeting glycolysis in phenotypically distinct breast cancer cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29391000>Computational investigations of physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, toxicological properties and molecular docking of , a constituent of Corypha taliera (Roxb.) with Phospholipase A2 (PLA2).</a></h1><p> (BA) is a natural triterpenoid compound and exhibits a wide range of biological and medicinal properties including anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore, this theoretical investigation is performed to evaluate (a) physicochemical properties such as acid dissociation constant (pKa), distribution coefficient (logD), partition coefficient (logP), aqueous solubility (logS), solvation free energy, dipole moment, polarizability, hyperpolarizability and different reactivity descriptors, (b) pharmacokinetic properties like human intestinal absorption (HIA), cellular permeability, skin permeability (P), plasma protein binding (PPB), penetration of the blood brain  (BBB), (c) toxicological properties including mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, risk of inhibition of hERG gene and (d) molecular mechanism of anti-inflammatory action which will aid the development of analytical method and the synthesis of BA derivatives.The physicochemical properties were calculated using MarvinSketch 15.6.29 and Gaussian 09 software package. The pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties were calculated on online server PreADMET. Further, the molecular docking study was conducted on AutoDock vina in PyRx 0.8.The aqueous solubility increased with increasing pH due to the ionization of BA leading to decrease in distribution coefficient. The solvation energies in water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile, n-octanol, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride were - 41.74 kJ/mol, - 53.80 kJ/mol, - 66.27 kJ/mol, - 69.64 kJ/mol, - 65.96 kJ/mol and - 60.13 kJ/mol, respectively. From the results of polarizability and softness, it was clear that BA is less stable and hence, kinetically more reactive in water. BA demonstrated good human intestinal absorption (HIA) and moderate cellular permeability. Further, BA also exhibited positive CNS activity due to high permeability through BBB. The toxicological study revealed that BA was a mutagenic compound but noncarcinogenic in mice model. Moreover, molecular docking study of BA with PLA2 revealed that BA interacts with GLY22 & GLY29 through hydrogen bond formation and LEU2, PHE5, HIS6, ALA17, ALA18, HIS47 and TYR51 through different types of hydrophobic interactions. The binding affinity of BA was - 41.00 kJ/mol which is comparable to the binding affinity of potent inhibitor 6-Phenyl-4(R)-(7-Phenyl-heptanoylamino)-hexanoic acid (BR4) (- 33.89 kJ/mol).Our computed properties may assist the development of analytical method to assay BA or to develop BA derivatives with better pharmacokinetic and toxicological profile.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30274214>Interactions between Triterpenes and a P-I Type Snake Venom Metalloproteinase: Molecular Simulations and Experiments.</a></h1><p>Small molecule inhibitors of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) could provide a means to rapidly halt the progression of local tissue damage following viperid snake envenomations. In this study, we examine the ability of candidate compounds based on a pentacyclic triterpene skeleton to inhibit SVMPs. We leverage molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the free energies of the candidate compounds for binding to BaP1, a P-I type SVMP, and compare these results with experimental assays of proteolytic activity inhibition in a homologous enzyme (Batx-I). Both simulation and experiment suggest that  is the most active candidate, with the simulations predicting a standard binding free energy of Δ G ∘ = - 11.0 ± 1.4 kcal/mol. The simulations also reveal the atomic interactions that underlie binding between the triterpenic acids and BaP1, most notably the electrostatic interaction between carboxylate groups of the compounds and the zinc cofactor of BaP1. Together, our simulations and experiments suggest that occlusion of the S1 ' subsite is essential for inhibition of proteolytic activity. While all active compounds make hydrophobic contacts in the S1 ' site, β -boswellic acid, with its distinct carboxylate position, does not occlude the S1 ' site in simulation and exhibits negligible activity in experiment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30799179> inhibits high-fat diet-induced obesity and improves energy balance by activating AMPK.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndromes are prevalent worldwide and result in various complications including obesity, cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes.  (BA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid that has anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that treatment with BA may result in decreased body weight gain, adiposity and hepatic steatosis in a diet-induced mouse model of obesity.Mice fed a high-fat diet and treated with BA showed less weight gain and tissue adiposity without any change in calorie intake. Gene expression profiling of mouse tissues and cell lines revealed that BA treatment increased expression of lipid oxidative genes and decreased that of lipogenesis-related genes. This modulation was mediated by increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, which facilitates energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and thermogenic capacity and exerts protective effects against obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Overall, BA markedly inhibited the development of obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice fed a high-fat diet, and AMPK activation in various tissues and enhanced thermogenesis are two possible mechanisms underlying the antiobesity and antisteatogenic effects of BA.The current findings suggest that treatment with BA is a potential dietary strategy for preventing obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Rhus chinensis Mill is a Chinese herbal medicine used to treat various types of solid tumors in China. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease group caused by abnormal changes in glucose metabolism resulted in lactic acid production, which remodels acidosis.Although previous studies have shown that the active compounds of Rhus chinensis Mill. can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, whether its triterpenoids could effectively regulate glycolysis involved in CRC have not been systematically investigated.In this study, the extraction of triterpenoids extract from Rhus chinensis Mill. was obtained, and cell viability assay, the percentage of apoptosis for CRC cells were counted, and matrigel invasion assay and production of lactic acid and glucose uptake assay was determined. we further examined the expression of the key glycolytic enzymes and acid-sending ion channel (ASIC) family members of SW620 cells, and some key proteins in the glycolytic pathway were further verified.Notably, triterpenoids (TER) of Rhus chinensis Mill. showed effective anti-proliferative activity and significantly altered protein levels associated with CRC cell survival and glycolysis metabolism. TER could down-regulate the expression of ASIC2, in CRC SW620 cell line. Most importantly, the levels of ASIC2 and calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) were also down-regulated by TER. Furthermore, inhibition of activated the ASIC2-mediated calcineurin/NFAT1 pathway and target gene transcript expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in parallel to reduce, and resulted in the reduced invasion ability by TER treatment.The potential pathways and targets that involved in glycolysis to excert the anti-CRC effects of main compounds in triterpenoids of Rhus chinensis Mill. were predicted by network pharmacology methods. Our findings thus provided rational evidence that inhibition of the ASIC2-induced calcineurin/NFAT pathway by triterpenoids in Rhus chinensis Mill. profoundly suppressed cell growth and invasion in CRC, which target alternative glycolysis in colorectal tumor cells, may be a useful adjuvant therapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
