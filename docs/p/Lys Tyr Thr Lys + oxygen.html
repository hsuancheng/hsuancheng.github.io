The large subunit (BphA1) of Bph Dox plays a crucial role in the determination of the substrate specificity of biphenyl-related compounds including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Previously, the substitution of Asn at -376 near the active-site iron in the BphA1 of Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 expanded the oxidation range and altered the regiospecificity of Bph Dox for PCBs. In this study, we replaced -376 with Gly, Ser, Gln, , Val, Phe, Asp, and  and expressed these enzymes in Escherichia coli. Bph Dox mutants of Thr376Asn, Thr376Val, Thr376Phe, and Thr376Lys showed novel degradation activity for dibenzofuran, which is a poor substrate for KF707 Bph Dox. All active Bph Dox mutants showed altered regiospecificity with 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl and 2,5,4'-trichlorobiphenyl. The Thr376Gly, Thr376Val, Thr376Phe, and Thr376Asp Bph Dox mutants introduced molecular  at the 2,3 position of 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl, forming 2-chloro-2',3'-dihydroxybiphenyl with concomitant dechlorination. The Bph Dox mutants of Thr376Gly, Thr376Ser, Thr376Asp, and Thr376Lys attacked 2,5,4'-trichlorobiphenyl via both 2',3'- and 3,4-dioxygenation activities. In particular, the Thr376Phe Bph Dox mutant exhibited enhanced and expanded degradation activities toward all of the compounds tested. Further site-directed mutation was induced to change the oxidizing character of KF707 Bph Dox to that of the Bph Dox of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 by the substitution of two amino acids, Ile335Phe and Thr376Asn, near the active-site.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134998>Peptide identification from a Porphyra dioica protein hydrolysate with antioxidant, angiotensin converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitory activities.</a></h2><p>A Porphyra dioica protein extract was enzymatically hydrolysed and then fractionated using semi-preparative reverse-phase high performance chromatography. The hydrolysate and its fractions were tested for their  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) along with their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activities. The most potent fraction was analysed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Eight peptide sequences were selected for synthesis based on their structure-activity criteria for bioactivity. Asp----Arg showed the highest ORAC activity (4.27 ± 0.15 μmol Trolox equivalent per μM). --Ile-Ala had the highest ACE inhibitory activity (IC50: 89.7 ± 7.10 μM). -Leu-Val-Ala was the only peptide showing DPP-IV inhibitory activity (IC50: 439 ± 44 μM). Apart from Asp----Arg and --Ile-Ala, which displayed increased ORAC activity, the bioactivities of the peptides were either maintained or decreased following in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The results indicate that P. dioica-derived peptides may have potential applications as health enhancing ingredients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30371011>Recent Updates on Protein N-Phosphoramidate Hydrolases.</a></h2><p>In contrast to well-recognized protein phosphorylation on the side-chain  of Ser, , or  residues, analogous phosphoramidation of the nitrogen of His, , and Arg side chains remains much less investigated, mainly due to the instability of post-translational modifications and technical difficulties involved in their analysis. For example, reports on the enzyme activities responsible for the formation and hydrolysis of these phosphoramidates date back to as early as the 1950s, but some of these enzymes have only recently been identified and functionally characterized; this has been aided by the development of novel research tools. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the enzymes that hydrolyze protein N-phosphoramidates, in terms of their structure, activities, and biological functions, as well as the chemical tools used to investigate them.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Their comparison with those obtained from rat liver gamma cystathionase (Fearon, C.W., Rodkey, J.A. and Abeles R.H. 1982.

There has been a recognizable pattern of mutations in the primary sequence of PLA2s that alter their catalytic properties significantly. In the present study, the amino acid sequence and the three-dimensional structure of a new isoform of PLA2 from crude venom of Indian cobra sub-species Naja naja sagittifera (N.n.s.) has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure has revealed several novel features of PLA2 folding and function. It contains 913 protein atoms and one each of Ca2+, phosphate and acetate ions with 142 solvent water molecules. A Ca2+ ion is present in the calcium-binding loop and forms a seven-fold coordination with a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. One of the coordination linkages is with the acetate ion, instead of the conserved water molecule. The presence of  at position 31 has a stabilizing effect on the loop  25-Cys 29 by interacting with carbonyl  atoms of  25, Gly 26 and Cys 29. In turn, it lends stability to the Ca(2+)-binding loop as well. Another unique feature of the PLA2 structure is the formation of an intrastrand hydrogen bond, involving Ogamma of  73 and Oepsilon2 of Glu 71, thus helping the beta-wing to act as a sharp arrow for insertion into other molecules. Yet another important feature of this PLA2 pertains to the conformation of its C-terminal segment, which is stabilized by a unique hydrogen bond through carbonyl  of  116 and Ndelta2 of Asn 120. This structural feature may be useful in the molecular recognition of the PLA2 through C-terminal segment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23283232>Structural and functional characterization of an anesthetic binding site in the second cysteine-rich domain of protein kinase Cδ*.</a></h2><p>Elucidating the principles governing anesthetic-protein interactions requires structural determinations at high resolutions not yet achieved with ion channels. Protein kinase C (PKC) activity is modulated by general anesthetics. We solved the structure of the phorbol-binding domain (C1B) of PKCδ complexed with an ether (methoxymethylcycloprane) and with an alcohol (cyclopropylmethanol) at 1.36-Å resolution. The cyclopropane rings of both agents displace a single water molecule in a surface pocket adjacent to the phorbol-binding site, making van der Waals contacts with the backbone and/or side chains of residues Asn-237 to Ser-240. Surprisingly, two water molecules anchored in a hydrogen-bonded chain between -242 and -260 impart elasticity to one side of the binding pocket. The cyclopropane ring takes part in π-acceptor hydrogen bonds with the amide of Met-239. There is a crucial hydrogen bond between the  atoms of the anesthetics and the hydroxyl of -236. A -236-Phe mutation results in loss of binding. Thus, both van der Waals interactions and hydrogen-bonding are essential for binding to occur. Ethanol failed to bind because it is too short to benefit from both interactions. Cyclopropylmethanol inhibited phorbol-ester-induced PKCδ activity, but failed to do so in PKCδ containing the -236-Phe mutation.Copyright © 2012 Biophysical Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The data are consistent with a type II' beta-turn for the tetrapeptide sequence -Tyr3-D-Trp4-Lys5-Thr6-. Solvent shielding of the Cys2 amide proton, observed in variable temperature experiments, suggests an orientation of this amide proton toward the gem dimethyls of Pen7 with possible hydrogen bonding to the Thr6 carbonyl , and a dihedral angle of -110 degrees for the disulfide bond. Partially relaxed Fourier transform 13C relaxation studies confirm a constrained cyclic system, with the C alpha carbons in the "hinge" of the beta-turn having the shortest t1 times.

The energy minimization and MD studies reveal the stabilization of the three redox proteins in their ternary complex through the direct and water mediated H-bonds and electrostatic interaction. The surface exposed polar residues of the three proteins, i.e., RCy (His 143,  146,  81, Glu 20), Cyt c4 (Asp 5, 15, 52, Ser 14, Glu 61), and CcO (Asp 135, Glu 126, 140, 142,  177) formed the intermolecular hydrogen bonds and stabilized the ternary complex. The  (Oepsilon1) of Glu 126, 140, and 142 on subunit II of the CcO interact to the exposed side-chain and Ob atoms of the Asp 52 of Cyt c4 and Glu 20 and Leu 12 of RCy. The Asp 135 of subunit II also forms H-bond with the Nepsilon atom of  81 of RCy. The Oepsilon1 of Glu 61 of Cyt c4 is also H-bonded to Ogamma atom of  177 of CcO. Solvation followed by MD studies of the ternary protein complex revealed the presence of seven water molecules in the interfacial region of the interacting proteins. Three of the seven water molecules (W 79, W 437, and W 606) bridged the three proteins by forming the hydrogen bonded network (with the distances approximately 2.10-2.95 A) between the  81 (RCy), Glu 61 (Cyt c4), and Asp 135 (CcO). Another water molecule W 603 was H-bonded to  122 (CcO) and interconnected the  81 (RCy) and Asp 135 (CcO) through the water molecules W 606 and W 437. The other two water molecules (W 21 and W 455) bridged the RCy to Cyt c4 through H-bonds, whereas the remaining W 76 interconnected the His 53 (Cytc4) to Glu 126 (CcO) with distances approximately 2.95-3.0 A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29609464>Structural Basis for Superoxide Activation of Flavobacterium johnsoniae Class I Ribonucleotide Reductase and for Radical Initiation by Its Dimanganese Cofactor.</a></h2><p>A ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) from Flavobacterium johnsoniae ( Fj) differs fundamentally from known (subclass a-c) class I RNRs, warranting its assignment to a new subclass, Id. Its β subunit shares with Ib counterparts the requirements for manganese(II) and superoxide (O) for activation, but it does not require the O-supplying flavoprotein (NrdI) needed in Ib systems, instead scavenging the oxidant from solution. Although Fj β has tyrosine at the appropriate sequence position ( 104), this residue is not oxidized to a radical upon activation, as occurs in the Ia/b proteins. Rather, Fj β directly deploys an oxidized dimanganese cofactor for radical initiation. In treatment with one-electron reductants, the cofactor can undergo cooperative three-electron reduction to the II/II state, in contrast to the quantitative univalent reduction to inactive "met" (III/III) forms seen with I(a-c) βs. This tendency makes Fj β unusually robust, as the II/II form can readily be reactivated. The structure of the protein rationalizes its distinctive traits. A distortion in a core helix of the ferritin-like architecture renders the active site unusually open, introduces a cavity near the cofactor, and positions a subclass-d-specific  residue to shepherd O to the Mn cluster. Relative to the positions of the radical tyrosines in the Ia/b proteins, the unreactive  104 of Fj β is held away from the cofactor by a hydrogen bond with a subclass-d-specific  residue. Structural comparisons, considered with its uniquely simple mode of activation, suggest that the Id protein might most closely resemble the primordial RNR-β.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12617685>First-second shell interactions in metal binding sites in proteins: a PDB survey and DFT/CDM calculations.</a></h2><p>The role of the second shell in the process of metal binding and selectivity in metalloproteins has been elucidated by combining Protein Data Bank (PDB) surveys of Mg, Mn, Ca, and Zn binding sites with density functional theory/continuum dielectric methods (DFT/CDM). Peptide backbone groups were found to be the most common second-shell ligand in Mg, Mn, Ca, and Zn binding sites, followed (in decreasing order) by Asp/Glu, /Arg, Asn/Gln, and Ser/ side chains. Aromatic - or nitrogen-containing side chains (, His, and Trp) and sulfur-containing side chains (Cys and Met) are seldom found in the second coordination layer. The backbone and Asn/Gln side chain are ubiquitous in the metal second coordination layer as their carbonyl  and amide hydrogen can act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor and donor, respectively, and can therefore partner practically every first-shell ligand. The second most common outer-shell ligand, Asp/Glu, predominantly hydrogen bonds to a metal-bound water or Zn-bound histidine and polarizes the H-O or H-N bond. In certain cases, a second-shell Asp/Glu could affect the protonation state of the metal ligand. It could also energetically stabilize a positively charged metal complex more than a neutral ligand such as the backbone and Asn/Gln side chain. As for the first shell, the second shell is predicted to contribute to the metal selectivity of the binding site by discriminating between metal cations of different ionic radii and coordination geometries. The first-shell-second-shell interaction energies decay rapidly with increasing solvent exposure of the metal binding site. They are less favorable but are of the same order of magnitude as compared to the respective metal-first-shell interaction energies. Altogether, the results indicate that the structure and properties of the second shell are dictated by those of the first layer. The outer shell is apparently designed to stabilize/protect the inner-shell and complement/enhance its properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7583766>Interaction of 2 amino acid substitutions within the same beta chain of human hemoglobin: the examples of Hb Corbeil and Hb Villeparisis.</a></h2><p>Only 16 hemoglobin (Hb) variants carrying 2 point mutations within the same polypeptide chain have been identified up to now. Two of those are reported in this paper. In Hb Villeparisis, the beta 77 (EF1) His--> mutation is identical to that of Hb Fukuyama while the other mutation, beta 80 (EF4) Asn-->Ser, has not yet been described. These 2 abnormalities are located almost within interacting distance. They lead to decreased  affinity and, according to molecular simulations, to a remodeling of the surface of the molecule. Hb Corbeil associates 2 substitutions, that of Hb E [beta 26 (B8) Glu-->], and of Hb Sherwood Forest [beta 104 (G6) Arg-->], which are far from one another. The resulting properties consist only in the additive effects of both abnormalities. Hb Corbeil is, thus, a thalassemic Hb, like Hb E, and a molecule having altered  binding properties, characterized by decreased heterotropic effects, similar to those of Hb Sherwood Forest. The simultaneous presence of more than 1 structural abnormality leads to a large spectrum of possible consequences on the function of the molecule, from local effects to a perturbation of intermolecular interactions. The genetic mechanism resulting in Hb with more than 1 point mutation is discussed: in some cases it is very likely that the second mutation arose on a chromosome already carrying a point mutation, in contrast a single mutational event involving a micro gene conversion has been proposed in other cases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18367446>Chemical and traditional mutagenesis of vaccinia DNA topoisomerase provides insights to cleavage site recognition and transesterification chemistry.</a></h2><p>Vaccinia DNA topoisomerase IB (TopIB) relaxes supercoils by forming and resealing a covalent DNA-(3'-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate. Here we gained new insights to the TopIB mechanism through "chemical mutagenesis." Meta-substituted analogs of (274) were introduced by in vitro translation in the presence of a chemically misacylated tRNA. We report that a meta-OH reduced the rate of DNA cleavage 130-fold without affecting the rate of religation. By contrast, meta-OCH(3) and NO(2) groups elicited only a 6-fold decrement in cleavage rate. We propose that the meta-OH uniquely suppresses deprotonation of the para-OH nucleophile during the cleavage step. Assembly of the vaccinia TopIB active site is triggered by protein contacts with a specific DNA sequence 5'-C(+5)C(+4)C(+3)T(+2)T(+1)p downward arrowN (where downward arrow denotes the cleavage site). A signature alpha-helix of the poxvirus TopIB ((132)GKMKYLKENETVG(144)) engages the target site in the major groove and thereby recruits catalytic residue Arg(130) to the active site. The effects of 11 missense mutations at (136) highlight the importance of van der Waals interactions with the 3'-G(+4)pG(+3)p dinucleotide of the nonscissile strand for DNA cleavage and supercoil relaxation. Asn(140) and (142) donate hydrogen bonds to the pro-(S(p))- of the G(+3)pA(+2) phosphodiester of the nonscissile strand. (133) and (135) interact with purine nucleobases in the major groove. Whereas none of these side chains is essential per se, an N140A/T142A double mutation reduces the rate of supercoil relaxation and DNA cleavage by 120- and 30-fold, respectively, and a K133A/K135A double mutation slows relaxation and cleavage by 120- and 35-fold, respectively. These results underscore functional redundancy at the TopIB-DNA interface.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29667555>Synthesis, Cytotoxicity and Antioxidant Activity of New Analogs of RC-121 Synthetic Derivatives of Somatostatin.</a></h2><p>Based on the structure of RC-121 (D-Phe-c (Cys--D-Trp--Val-Cys)--NH2, - synthetic derivatives of somatostatin), some analogs were synthesized and tested for in vitro cytotoxic and antioxidant activity.The new analogs were modifyed at position 5 with Dap (diaminopropanoic acid), Dab (diaminobutanoic acid) and Orn and at position 6 with the unnatural amino acids Tle (t-leucine).The in vitro cytotoxic effects of the substances were investigated against a panel of human tumor cell lines HT-29 (Human Colorectal Cancer Cell Line), MDA-MB-23 (Human Breast Cancer Cell Line), Hep G-2 (Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Line) and HeLa (cervical cancer cell line). The antioxidant capacities were tested by ORAC ( Radical Antioxidant Capacity) and HORAC (Hydroxyl Radical Averting Capacity) methods.All substances expressed significantly higher antioxidant capacity by comparison with galic acid and Trolox. All substances showed considerable antioxidant capacity as well. Compound 2T (D-Phe-c(Cys--DTrp- Dap-Tle-Cys)--NH2)had the highest antioxidant effect. The compound 4T (D-Phe-c(Cys--D-Trp- Orn-Tle-Cys)--NH2) displayed antiproliferative effect on HeLa cells with IC50 30 µM.

Comparison with other activated receiver domains.</a></h2><p>The crystal structure of BeF(3)(-)-activated CheY, with manganese in the magnesium binding site, was determined at 2.4-A resolution. BeF(3)(-) bonds to Asp(57), the normal site of phosphorylation, forming a hydrogen bond and salt bridge with (87) and (109), respectively. The six coordination sites for manganese are satisfied by a fluorine of BeF(3)(-), the side chain oxygens of Asp(13) and Asp(57), the carbonyl  of Asn(59), and two water molecules. All of the active site interactions seen for BeF(3)(-)-CheY are also observed in P-Spo0A(r). Thus, BeF(3)(-) activates CheY as well as other receiver domains by mimicking both the tetrahedral geometry and electrostatic potential of a phosphoryl group. The aromatic ring of (106) is found buried within a hydrophobic pocket formed by beta-strand beta4 and helix H4. The tyrosine side chain is stabilized in this conformation by a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the backbone carbonyl  of Glu(89). This hydrogen bond appears to stabilize the active conformation of the beta4/H4 loop. Comparison of the backbone coordinates for the active and inactive states of CheY reveals that only modest changes occur upon activation, except in the loops, with the largest changes occurring in the beta4/H4 loop. This region is known to be conformationally flexible in inactive CheY and is part of the surface used by activated CheY for binding its target, FliM. The pattern of activation-induced backbone coordinate changes is similar to that seen in FixJ(r). A common feature in the active sites of BeF(3)(-)-CheY, P-Spo0A(r), P-FixJ(r), and phosphono-CheY is a salt bridge between (109) Nzeta and the phosphate or its equivalent, beryllofluoride. This suggests that, in addition to the concerted movements of (87) and (106) (- coupling), formation of the (109)-PO(3)(-) salt bridge is directly involved in the activation of receiver domains generally.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1518799>NMR docking of a substrate into the X-ray structure of staphylococcal nuclease.</a></h2><p>The conformation of the staphylococcal nuclease-bound metal-dTdA complex, previously determined by NMR methods [Weber, D.J., Mullen, G.P., Mildvan, A.S.

(1989) Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. 5:183-201] by superimposing the metal ions, taking into account intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects from assigned aromatic proton resonances of -85, -113, and -115 to proton resonances of the leaving dA moiety of dTdA, and energy minimization to relieve small overlaps. The proton resonances of the Phe, , and Trp residues of the enzyme in the ternary enzyme-La(3+)-dTdA complex were sequence specifically assigned by 2D phase-sensitive NOESY, with and without deuteration of the aromatic protons of the  residues, and by 2D heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) spectroscopy and 3D NOESY-HMQC spectroscopy with 15N labeling. While resonances of most Phe,  and Trp residues were unshifted by the substrate dTdA from those found in the enzyme-La(3+)-3',5'-pdTp complex and the enzyme-Ca(2+)-3',5'-pdTp complex, proton resonances of -85, -113, -115, and Phe-34 were shifted by 0.08 to 0.33 ppm and the 15N resonance of -113 was shifted by 2.1 ppm by the presence of substrate. The optimized position of enzyme-bound dTdA shows the 5'-dA leaving group to partially overlap the inhibitor, 3',5'-pdTp (in the X-ray structure). The 3'-TMP moiety of dTdA points toward the solvent in a channel defined by Ile-18, Asp-19, -22, -45, and His-46. The phosphate of dTdA is coordinated by the metal, and an adjacent inner sphere water ligand is positioned to donate a hydrogen bond to the general base Glu-43 and to attack the phosphorus with inversion. Arg-35 and Arg-87 donate monodentate hydrogen bonds to different phosphate oxygens of dTdA, with Arg-87 positioned to protonate the leaving 5'- of dA, thus clarifying the mechanism of hydrolysis. Model building of an additional 5'-dGMP onto the 3'- of dA placed this third nucleotide onto a surface cleft near residues Glu-80, Asp-83, -84, and -115 with its 3'-OH group accessible to the solvent, thus defining the size of the substrate binding site as accommodating a trinucleotide.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7826417>[Biologically active peptides isolated from the brain of hibernating ground squirrels].</a></h2><p>More than 20 peptides have been isolated and sequenced from the brain of hibernating ground squirrel Citellus undulatus. Some of the isolated peptides were chemically synthesized and investigated for the spectrum of biological activity. One of the isolated peptides, neokyotorphin (-Ser---Arg), earlier known as a weak analgetic, is found to have a cardiotropic and thermoregulatory activity. Neokyotorphin activates in vitro voltage-dependent calcium and blocks ATP-dependent potassium currents in the frog atrial fibres. Intraperitoneal injection of this peptide in hibernating ground squirrels speeds up the arousal of animals increasing sharply the heart rate and  consumption. Intraperitoneal and intranasal administrations of neokyotorphin in rats raises body temperature in thermoneutral conditions (26-28 degrees C) exerting no effects at low (4-6 degrees C) and high (31-32 degrees C) environmental temperatures. Another isolated peptide, Asp-, blocks the inward voltage-dependent calcium current in the frog atrial fibres and slightly increases the outward potassium current. Sulfated analogue of this dipeptide (aspartyl-O-sulfate-tyrosine) more effectively blocks the inward voltage-dependent calcium current in the frog atrial fibres and have no effects on the outward potassium current.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12071346>Lysozyme modification by the fenton reaction and gamma radiation.</a></h2><p>A comparative study was performed on lysozyme modification after exposure to Fenton reagent (Fe(II)/H2 O2) or hydroxyl radicals produced by y radiation. The conditions were adjusted to obtain, with both systems, a 50% loss of activity of the modified ensemble. Gamma radiation modified almost all types of amino acid residues in the enzyme, with little specificity. The modification order was  > Met = Cys >  > Ile + Leu > Gly > Pro = Phe >  + Ala > Trp = Ser > Arg > Asp + Glu, with 42 mol of modified residues per initial mole of native enzyme. In contrast, when the enzyme was exposed to the Fenton reaction, only some types of amino acids were modified. Furthermore, a smaller number of residues (13.5) were damaged per initial mole of enzyme. The order of the modified residues was  > Cys > Trp > Met His > Ile + Leu > Val > Arg. These results demonstrate that the modifications elicited by these two free radical sources follow different mechanisms. An intramolecular free radical chain reaction is proposed to play a dominant role in the oxidative modification of the protein promoted by gamma radiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2644279>Discrimination between  and carbon monoxide and inhibition of autooxidation by myoglobin. Site-directed mutagenesis of the distal histidine.</a></h2><p>Sperm whale myoglobin mutants were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis to replace the highly conserved distal histidine residue (His(E7)-64). His-64 was substituted with Gly, Val, Phe, Cys, Met, , Arg, Asp, , and , and all 10 mutant proteins expressed to approximately 10% of the total soluble cell protein in Escherichia coli as heme containing myoglobin. With the exception of His-64----, which did not form a stable  (O2) complex, all mutant proteins could be reduced and bound O2 and carbon monoxide (CO) reversibly. However, removal of the distal histidine increased the rate of autooxidation 40-350-fold. The His-64----Gly, Val, Phe, Met, and Arg mutants all showed markedly increased O2 dissociation rate constants which were approximately 50-1500-fold higher than those for wild-type myoglobin and increased O2 association rate constants which were approximately 5-15-fold higher than those for the native protein. All mutants studied (except His-64----) showed approximately 10-fold increased CO association rates and relatively unchanged CO dissociation rates. These altered O2 and CO association and dissociation rate constants resulted in 3-14-fold increased CO affinities, 10-200-fold decreased O2 affinities, and 50-380-fold greater M (KCO/KO2) values for the mutants compared to the wild-type protein. Thus, the distal histidine of myoglobin discriminates between CO and O2 binding by both sterically hindering bound CO and stabilizing bound O2 through hydrogen bonding. The increased autooxidation rates observed for the mutants appear to be due to a decrease in  affinity and an increase in solvent anion accessibility to the distal pocket.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439548>Effect of reverse photoperiod on in vitro regeneration and piperine production in Piper nigrum L.</a></h2><p>In this study, a novel approach for in vitro regeneration of Piper nigrum L. has been applied in order to increase healthy biomass, phytochemicals and piperine production via reverse photoperiod (16hD/8hL).

Higher amino acid production was observed under normal photoperiod (16hL/8hD) than under reverse photoperiod (16hD/8hL). The highest total phenolic content (TPC; 9.91 mg/g-DW) and flavonoid content (7.38 mg/g-DW) were observed in callus cultures incubated under 16hL/8hD than other tissues incubated under 16hD/8hL photoperiod. Higher DPPH and PoMo activities were observed in tissues incubated under 16hL/8hD photoperiod, while ABTS and Fe²⁺ chelating activities were found higher in tissues incubated under reverse photoperiod. Significant quantities of piperine content were observed in all tissues except callus cultures. These results suggest that reverse photoperiod is a promising approach for callus induction, phytochemicals and piperine production for commercial applications.Copyright © 2013 Académie des sciences.

The efficiency of the tyrosine-to-dopa conversion was examined under varied conditions, such as the substrate-to-tyrosine ratio, concentrations of reductant and  in the reaction solution, pH, temperature and reaction time. The highest dopa yields were achieved with the following optimal conditions for hydroxylation: 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7, 25 mM ascorbic acid, 1 mM tyrosine, 50 micrograms/ml tyrosinase and 20 degrees C. Using these conditions, up to 70% of free tyrosine was converted into dopa, and tyrosine residues in several synthetic peptides were also hydroxylated to dopa residues at ratios as high as free tyrosine. The preparation of hydroxylated analogues of the decapeptide (Ala--Pro-Ser--Pro-Pro---), in particular, may contribute to a better understanding of adhesion in the dopa-containing mussel glue protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1455953>[The hypometabolic effect of the blood plasma from a hibernating suslik Citellus undulatus. Neokyotorphin activates cardiac and respiratory activities in the suslik during arousal from hibernation].</a></h2><p>The effect of intraabdominal injection of the blood serum from ground squirrels Citellus undulatus obtained at various stages of the baut has been studied on the level of  consumption in albino mice. The strongest hypometabolic effect exhibited the blood plasma from animals at the beginning of the baut. The onset of baut was used in further experiments on C. undulatus for investigation of activating effects of neokiotorphin (-Ser---Arg) which was earlier found in the brain of the ground squirrel. It was shown that intraabdominal injection of this peptide to hibernating animals facilitates their arousal stimulating both the cardiac activity and respiration. The strongest effect was noted with neokiotorphin of [D-Ser] 2-modification which is more stable to proteolysis.</p></html>
