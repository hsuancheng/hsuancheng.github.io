However, discontinuation of contraceptive methods and decline in the use of long-acting and permanent methods (LAPMs) are still the major concerns of the family planning programmes. This paper describes various factors that lead to the acceptance of the long-term method--Norplant and those that lead to early discontinuation. This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in the Family Planning Association of Bangladesh (FPAB), Dinajpur, during March-June 2005 among 73 women who visited the clinic to remove their Norplant before its usual duration (5 years). The women were in the 25-31 years age-group--around two-thirds of them (57.5%) without formal education, and three-fourths of them (75.3%) were housewives. Most of them had been married for nine years, on average, and had two and/or more children. Sixty-seven percent of the women experienced regular menstruation, and 95% had used other contraceptive methods prior to using Norplant. Past users of Norplant were the single-most important source of information for about three-fourths of the women (74%); half of the women (51%) had discussed the method with their husbands, and majority (96%) of the husbands were informed about the women's decision on accepting the method before its implantation. All women were aware about the usual length of the effectiveness of Norplant. The most common reason for early removal of Norplant was menstrual disorder (59%), followed by desire for children (16%), husband's death, for abandonment or residing abroad (8%), anorexia, nausea, vomiting (7%),  gain (4%), husband's objection (3%), and religious beliefs (3%). Service providers should properly counsel the couple before providing any contraceptive method, informing them about method-related side-effects and clearing any religious misconceptions. They should also explore the perception of women as well as their partners' desire for children; couples who would like to have a baby within a year or two can be encouraged to use a short-term method that can be more easily discontinued.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12286082>Acceptability of IUDs is increasing.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16904415>Comparison profiles of cycle control, side effects and sexual satisfaction of three hormonal contraceptives.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to compare cycle control, tolerability and sexual well-being with the use of three hormonal contraceptives.In this prospective randomized study, the effects of two combined oral contraceptives [20 microg of ethinylestradiol (EE)/100 microg of  and 15 microg of EE/60 microg of gestodene] were compared with those of the vaginal ring (15 microg of EE/120 microg of etonogestrel).

We previously showed in macaques that there is a significantly higher simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) acquisition rate in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, which presents a naturally high-progesterone state, and this may be attributable to altered expression of innate immune factors. We hypothesized that progestin-based contraception, especially depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), would, in a similar way, affect mucosal immune factors that influence HIV acquisition risk.We used a pig-tailed macaque model to evaluate the effects of two progestin-based contraceptives, DMPA, and  (LNG)/ethinyl estradiol (EE)-based combined oral contraceptives (COCs), on innate mucosal factors. We compared the vaginal epithelial thickness data from previous studies and used cytokine profiling and microarray analysis to evaluate contraception-induced molecular changes in the vagina.The administration of DMPA caused a reduction in the thickness of the vaginal epithelium relative to that of the follicular or luteal phase. DMPA also induced a significant increase in vaginal levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Both DMPA- and LNG-based contraception induced a signature of gene expression similar to that of the luteal phase, only more exacerbated, including widespread downregulation of antiviral genes.The use of progestin-based contraception might engender a milieu that poses an increased risk of HIV acquisition as compared to both the luteal and follicular phases of the menstrual cycle.Published 2018.

The primary outcome was the change in crude birth rate (CBR) before (2010-2012) and after (2014-2016) introduction of the implant. Secondary outcomes were the change in rates (per year/1000 births) of severe postpartum hemorrhage, postpartum infection, hospital readmission, prematurity (<37 weeks), low birth  (<2500 g) and maternal and neonatal mortality. We also studied changes in the number of pregnancies affected by grand multiparity (≥4) and short interpregnancy interval (<12 months) for the same time periods. Data were analyzed using interrupted time series and Poisson regression.CBR was stable until 2012 and then declined from 2014 (p<.0001). Following introduction of the implant, the annual rate/1000 births of selected adverse birth outcomes decreased between 56% and 74% (p<.0001). The number of women with parity ≥4 who gave birth decreased by 59% (p<.0001), and the number with interpregnancy interval <12 months decreased by 64% (p<.0001).Introduction of the contraceptive implant was associated with reductions in CBR, maternal and neonatal morbidity, and the number of women with high-risk pregnancies giving birth.These results encourage efforts to increase knowledge and availability of the contraceptive implant in low- and middle-income countries such as PNG. In cases where it reduces the CBR and the number of women with high-risk pregnancies birthing, the implant may have a beneficial impact on maternal and neonatal morbidity.Copyright © 2019.

During their reproductive age, more than 30% of women will complain of or experience a heavy amount of bleeding, which leads to a debilitating health outcome, including significantly reduced health-related quality of life, and a considerable economic burden on the health care system. Although surgical treatment might be the most important definite treatment, especially hysterectomy for those women who have finished bearing children, the uterus is still regarded as the regulator and controller of important physiological functions, a sexual organ, a source of  and vitality, and a maintainer of youth and attractiveness. This has resulted in a modern trend in which women may reconsider the possibility of organ preservation. For women who wish to retain the uterus, medical treatment may be one of the best alternatives.

A wide range of hormonal contraceptives (HCs), which differ in composition, concentration of the progestin component, frequency of dosage, and method of administration, is currently available globally. However, the options are rather limited in settings with restricted economic resources that frequently overlap with areas of high HIV-1 prevalence. The predominant contraceptive used in sub-Saharan Africa is the progestin-only three-monthly injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. Determination of whether HCs affect HIV-1 acquisition has been hampered by behavioral differences potentially confounding clinical observational data. Meta-analysis of these studies shows a significant association between depot medroxyprogesterone acetate use and increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition, raising important concerns. No association was found for combined oral contraceptives containing , nor for the two-monthly injectable contraceptive norethisterone enanthate, although data for norethisterone enanthate are limited. Susceptibility to HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted infections may, however, be dependent on the type of progestin present in the formulation. Several underlying biological mechanisms that may mediate the effect of HCs on HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted infection acquisition have been identified in clinical, animal, and ex vivo studies. A substantial gap exists in the translation of basic research into clinical practice and public health policy. To bridge this gap, we review the current knowledge of underlying mechanisms and biological effects of commonly used progestins. The review sheds light on issues critical for an informed choice of progestins for the identification of safe, effective, acceptable, and affordable contraceptive methods.Copyright © 2018 Endocrine Society.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643382>Emergency Contraceptive Agents.</a></h2><p> is a synthetic progesterone that is used for emergency contraception.  is also used alone and in combination with estrogens in conventional oral contraceptives.

We examined the effects of patient obesity on primary breast tumor gene expression, by profiling transcription of a set of 103 tumors for which the patients'  mass index (BMI) was ascertained. Sample profiles were stratified according to patients' obesity phenotype defined as normal (BMI < 25), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), or obese (BMI ≥ 30). Widespread gene expression alterations were evident in breast tumors from obese patients as compared to other tumors, allowing us to define an obesity-associated cancer transcriptional signature of 662 genes. In multiple public expression data sets of breast cancers (representing > 1,500 patients), manifestation of the obesity signature patterns correlated with manifestation of a gene signature for IGF signaling and (to a lesser extent) with lower levels of estrogen receptor. In one patient cohort, manifestation of the obesity signature correlated with shorter time to metastases. A number of small molecules either induced or suppressed the obesity-associated transcriptional program in vitro; estrogens alpha-estradiol, , and hexestrol induced the program, while several anti-parkinsonian agents targeting neurotransmitter receptor pathways repressed the program. Obesity in breast cancer patients appears to impact the gene expression patterns of the tumor (perhaps as a result of altered  chemistry).

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures fell by 1-4 mm Hg in groups A, B, and C (significant for A and C vs. D) and increased by 1-2 mm Hg in group D. Renin substrate rose equally in all groups (P < 0.05), whereas PRA and plasma aldosterone rose significantly only in the DRSP groups, presumably due to sodium loss. In the DRSP groups, high density lipoprotein cholesterol rose (P < 0.05), in contrast to group D. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol fell slightly (P > 0.05), whereas triglyceride levels showed a stronger increase in the DRSP groups (P < 0.05) than in group D. All groups attained good cycle control; group A had the best. Side-effects were minimal. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a combined OC that leads to a small decrease in body weight and blood pressure. It may be especially beneficial for women susceptible for a gain in weight and a rise in blood pressure.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21656494>[Health risks of oral contraceptives].</a></h2><p>Oral contraceptives (OC) are either composed of a combination of an estrogen derivative (usually ethinly estradiol) and a progestogen, or they contain a progestogen only. OC are characterized by a high effectiveness and have a low failure rate if taken correctly. Most women tolerate OC relatively well, but adverse effects do occur which are driven by the estrogen dose as well as by the type of progestogen. The most frequently reported adverse effects are nausea or vomiting, breast tenderness, headache or inbalanced mood, but these unwanted side effects are often transient. The fear of  gain of many OC users is not necessarily supported by data from studies which report relatively little differences in  mass index on average during OC use. Nevertheless, substantial  gain can occur in individual women. The widely discussed fear of breast cancer is also not justified, and the risk of developing ovarian or endometrial cancer is reduced for women who use OC on a regular basis. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the adverse effect with the greatest potential for serious harm if pulmonary embolism develops. This rare, but potentially dangerous adverse effect of OC has been discussed emotionally for many years and keeps attracting a lot of public interest. VTE is rare in young women, but the VTE risk is increased two- to sixfold for OC users as compared to non-users. The VTE risk increases with increasing estrogen dose, is highest in the first year of use, and is higher for OC from the third generation (containing desogestrel, gestodene or norgestimate) than for OC from the second generation (containing ) or than for the progestogen-only pill. According to most studies, OC containing the progestogens drospirenone or cyproterone acetate are similar with regard to VTE risks than OC from the third generation. Individual genetic susceptibility affecting the clotting system plays a major role in the risk of developing VTE in combination with OC, and smoking is also an important contributing factor to an increased VTE risk for women using OC. It is important that doctors and pharmacists inform new users of OC about potential health risks of OC use, and that the personal and family history of previous health risks is assessed thoroughly in order to rule out that important and relevant contraindications are present when a women starts taking OC.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29458551>Short- and long-term influence of the -releasing intrauterine system (Mirena®) on vaginal  and Candida.</a></h2><p>Recurrent vulvovaginal infections are a frequent complaint in young women in need of contraception. However, the influence of the contraceptive method on the course of the disease is not well known.To investigate the influence of the -releasing intrauterine-system (LNG-IUS) on the vaginal microflora.Short-term (3 months) and long-term (1 to 5 years) changes of vaginal  were compared with pre-insertion values in 252 women presenting for LNG-IUS insertion. Detailed microscopy on vaginal fluid was used to define lactobacillary grades (LBGs), bacterial vaginosis (BV), aerobic vaginitis (AV) and the presence of Candida. Cultures for enteric aerobic bacteria and Candida were used to back up the microscopy findings. Fisher's test was used to compare vaginal microbiome changes pre- and post-insertion.Compared to the pre-insertion period, we found a temporary worsening in LBGs and increased rates of BV and AV after 3 months of LNG-IUS. After 1 and 5 years, however, these changes were reversed, with a complete restoration to pre-insertion levels. Candida increased significantly after long-term carriage of LNG-IUS compared to the period before insertion [OR 2.0 (CL951.1-3.5), P=0.017].Short-term use of LNG-IUS temporarily decreases lactobacillary dominance, and increases LBG, AV and BV, but after 1 to 5 years these characteristics return to pre-insertion levels, reducing the risk of complications to baseline levels. Candida colonization, on the other hand, is twice as high after 1 to 5 years of LNG-IUS use, making it less indicated for long-term use in patients with or at risk for recurrent vulvovaginal candidosis.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization', 'microbiome', 'microbiota']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11929643>An open label, comparative study of the effects of a dose-reduced oral contraceptive containing 20 microg ethinyl estradiol and 100 microg  on hemostatic, lipids, and carbohydrate  variables.</a></h2><p>In this open label, randomized study we compared the influence of a dose-reduced oral contraceptive containing 20 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 100 microg  (20 EE) with a reference preparation containing 30 microg EE and 150 microg  (30 EE) on hemostatic, lipids, and carbohydrate  variables.

An increased risk of VTE still remains, however. Other concerns, such as effects on lipid and carbohydrate , have also been reported. In this study we compared two reference combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing ethinylestradiol (EE)/ (LNG) and EE/drospirenone (DRSP) with COCs containing estradiol (E2) (estradiol valerate [E2V]/dienogest [DNG] and E2/nomegestrol acetate [NOMAC]). They were evaluated according to their influence on recognised haemostatic and  markers.A literature search of the MEDLINE/PubMed database was conducted for head-to-head studies. EE/LNG was chosen as the comparator pill.The haemostatic impact of E2 pills and EE/LNG has been extensively compared, in contrast to that of EE/DRSP and EE/LNG. Changes in haemostatic and  marker levels between EE/LNG and E2V/DNG were generally not statistically significant. E2/NOMAC showed statistically significantly favourable results on haemostatic markers and had a neutral effect on carbohydrate and lipid  when compared with EE/LNG.E2/NOMAC exhibits less haemostatic and  impact than EE/LNG and other COCs, suggesting that it may be a promising candidate to reduce residual VTE risk associated with COC use.

Synthetic progestogens, or progestins, were designed to mimic progesterone (P) for use in contraception and hormonal replacement therapy in women. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and norethisterone (NET) are the most widely used injectable contraceptives in the developing world, while other progestins such as  (LNG), etonogestrel (ETG) and nestorone (NES) are used in or being developed for other forms of contraception. As concerns remain about the most appropriate choice of progestin and dosage, and the associated side-effects, the mechanisms and biological effects of progestins are frequently investigated in various in vitro mammalian cell line and tissue models. However, whether progestogens are differentially metabolised in different cell types in vivo or in vitro is unknown. For nine mammalian cell lines commonly used to investigate progestogen mechanisms of action, we developed and validated an ultra-high performance supercritical fluid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPSFC-MS/MS) protocol for simultaneously quantifying the  of the above-mentioned steroids. We show for the first time that, while 50-100% of P was metabolised within 24 h in all cell lines, the  of the progestins is progestin- and cell line-specific. We also show that MPA and NET are significantly metabolised in human cervical tissue, but to a lesser extent than P. Taken together, our findings suggest that differential progestogen  may play a role in cell-specific therapeutic and side-effects. Relative affinities for binding to steroid receptors as well as potencies, efficacies and biocharacters for transcriptional activity of progestins, relative to P, are most frequently determined using some of the cell lines investigated. Our results, however, suggest that differential  of progestins and P may confound these results. In particular,  may under-estimate the receptor-mediated intrinsic in vitro binding and dose-response values and predicted endogenous physiological effects of P.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A combination of poly (lactide) (PLA) and a solvent mixture of benzyl benzoate (BB) and benzyl alcohol (BA) was used in the phase-sensitive polymer delivery systems. The effects of solvent systems and polymer concentrations on the in vitro LNG release were evaluated. In the case of thermosensitive polymer delivery systems, a series of low-molecular- poly (lactide-co-glycolide)-poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) triblock copolymers with varying ratios of lactide/glycolide (LA/GA, 2.0-3.5) were used. The effects of varying block length of copolymers 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the in vitro LNG release were evaluated. Phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% w/v Tween-80 was used as in vitro release medium. The amount of the released LNG was determined by an high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. A controlled (zero-order) in vitro release of LNG was observed from both phase-sensitive and thermosensitive-polymer delivery systems. Increasing the concentration of the phase-sensitive polymer from 5% to 30% significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the release rate of LNG from 38.32 microg/day to 31.45 microg/day; and increasing the hydrophilic fraction of the solvents mixture (i.e., BA) significantly (p < 0.05) increased the release rate of LNG. In the case of the thermosensitive polymer delivery system, increasing the hydrophobic PLGA block length of copolymers significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the release rate of LNG (98.65 microg/day to 67.60 microg/day).

Studies also suggest that nicotine, a major tobacco alkaloid, may worsen or improve atherothrombotic CVD. Altered hemorheology, prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory biomarkers, have been implicated in the development of atherothrombotic CVD events. However, the effect of non-smoking nicotine exposure on these biomarkers during COC treatment is not yet established. We therefore sought to determine the effects of nicotine exposure during COC treatment on these biomarkers, and also tested the hypothesis that the nicotine effects would be glucocorticoid-dependent.Female Sprague-Dawley rats aged 10 weeks were given (po) vehicle, low-dose nicotine (0.1mg/kg) or high-dose nicotine (1.0mg/kg) with or without COC steroids (5.0μg/kg ethinylestradiol and 25.0μg/kg ) daily for 6 weeks.COC treatment or nicotine exposure led to increased insulin resistance (IR), hemorheological (blood viscosity, hematocrit and plasma viscosity), prothrombotic (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), pro-inflammatory (uric acid, C-reactive protein, neutrophil/lymphocyte and platelet/lymphocyte ratios) biomarkers and corticosterone. However, these effects except that on corticosterone were abrogated by nicotine exposure during COC treatment.Our study indicates that nicotine- or COC-induced IR may be mediated via inflammatory/thrombotic pathway. The results imply that nicotine exposure could impact negatively on atherothrombotic biomarkers in COC non-users, whereas the impact in COC users could be positive.

Rates of endometrial cancer are rising, in part because of rising  rates. Endometrial hyperplasia is a precancerous condition in women that can lead to endometrial cancer if left untreated. Endometrial hyperplasia occurs more commonly than endometrial cancer. Progesterone tablets currently used to treat women with endometrial hyperplasia are associated with adverse effects in up to 84% of women. The  intrauterine device (Mirena Coil, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Whippany, NJ, USA) may improve compliance, but it is invasive, is not acceptable to all women, and is associated with irregular vaginal bleeding in 82% of cases. Therefore, an alternative treatment for women with endometrial hyperplasia is needed. Metformin, a drug that is often used to treat people with diabetes, has been shown in some human studies to reverse endometrial hyperplasia. However, the effectiveness and safety of metformin for treatment of endometrial hyperplasia remain uncertain.To determine the effectiveness and safety of metformin in treating women with endometrial hyperplasia.We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, Google Scholar, OpenGrey, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and two trials registers from inception to 10 January 2017. We searched the bibliographies of all included studies and reviews on this topic. We also handsearched the conference abstracts of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) 2015 and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) 2015.We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cross-over trials comparing metformin (used alone or in combination with other medical therapies) versus placebo or no treatment, any conventional medical treatment, or any other active intervention for women with histologically confirmed endometrial hyperplasia of any type.Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted data from included studies, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by deferment to a third review author. When study details were missing, review authors contacted study authors. The primary outcome of this review was regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology (with or without atypia) towards normal histology. Secondary outcome measures included recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia, progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer, hysterectomy rate, abnormal uterine bleeding, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects during treatment.We included three RCTs in which a total of 77 women took part. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low for all outcomes owing to very serious risk of bias (associated with poor reporting, attrition, and limitations in study design) and imprecision.We performed a meta-analysis of two trials with 59 participants. When metformin was compared with megestrol acetate in women with endometrial hyperplasia, we found insufficient evidence to determine whether there were differences between groups for the following outcomes: regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology towards normal histology (odds ratio (OR) 3.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 11.57, two RCTs, n = 59, very low-quality evidence), hysterectomy rates (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.05 to 15.52, two RCTs, n = 59, very low-quality evidence), and rates of abnormal uterine bleeding (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.05 to 15.52, two RCTs, n = 44 , very low-quality evidence). We found no data for recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia or health-related quality of life. Both studies (n = 59) provided data on progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer as well as one (n = 16) reporting some adverse effects in the metformin arm, notably nausea, thrombosis, lactic acidosis, abnormal liver and renal function among others.Another trial including 16 participants compared metformin plus megestrol acetate versus megestrol acetate alone in women with endometrial hyperplasia. We found insufficient evidence to determine whether there were differences between groups for the following outcomes: regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology towards normal histology (OR 9.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 86.52, one RCT, n = 16, very low-quality evidence), recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia among women who achieve regression (OR not estimable, no events recorded, one RCT, n = 8, very low-quality evidence), progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer (OR not estimable, no events recorded, one RCT, n = 13, very low-quality evidence), or hysterectomy rates (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.37, one RCT, n = 16, very low-quality evidence). Investigators provided no data on abnormal uterine bleeding or health-related quality of life. In terms of adverse effects, three of eight participants (37.5%) in the metformin plus megestrol acetate study arm reported nausea.At present, evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of metformin alone or in combination with standard therapy - specifically, megestrol acetate - versus megestrol acetate alone, for treatment of endometrial hyperplasia. Robustly designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials yielding long-term outcome data are needed to address this clinical question.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679478>Extended use of the intrauterine device: a literature review and recommendations for clinical practice.</a></h2><p>There are multiple advantages to "extended use" of the intrauterine device (IUD) use beyond the manufacturer-approved time period, including prolongation of contraceptive and non-contraceptive benefits. We performed a literature review of studies that have reported pregnancy outcomes associated with extended use of IUDs, including copper IUDs and the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). Among parous women who are at least 25 years old at the time of IUD insertion, there is good evidence to support extended use of the following devices: the TCu380A and the TCu220 for 12 years, the Multiload Cu-375 for 10 years, the frameless GyneFix® (330 mm²) for 9 years, the  intrauterine system 52 mg (Mirena®) for 7 years and the Multiload Cu-250 for 4 years. Women who are at least 35 years old at the time of insertion of a TCu380A IUD can continue use until menopause with a negligible risk of pregnancy. We found no data to support use of the LNG-IUS 13.5 mg (Skyla®) beyond 3 years. When counseling about extended IUD use, clinicians should consider patient characteristics and preferences, as well as country- and community-specific factors. Future research is necessary to determine the risk of pregnancy associated with extended use of the copper IUD and the LNG-IUS among nulliparous women and women less than 25 years old at the time of IUD insertion. More data are needed on the potential effect of overweight and  on the long-term efficacy of the LNG-IUS.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To evaluate their impact on immune responses to sequential IAV infections, adult female mice were treated with placebo or one of two progestins, P4 or  (LNG), and infected with a mouse-adapted H1N1 (maH1N1) virus. Treatment with P4 or LNG reduced morbidity but had no effect on pulmonary virus titers during primary H1N1 infection compared to placebo treatment. In serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, total anti-IAV IgG and IgA titers and virus-neutralizing antibody titers but not hemagglutinin stalk antibody titers were lower in progestin-treated mice than placebo-treated mice. Females were challenged 6 weeks later with either an maH1N1 drift variant (maH1N1dv) or maH3N2 IAV. The level of protection following infection with the maH1N1dv was similar among all groups. In contrast, following challenge with maH3N2, progestin treatment reduced survival as well as the numbers and activity of H1N1- and H3N2-specific memory CD8 T cells, including tissue-resident cells, compared with placebo treatment. In contrast to primary IAV infection, progestin treatment increased the titers of neutralizing and IgG antibodies against both challenge viruses compared with those achieved with placebo treatment. While the immunomodulatory properties of progestins protected immunologically naive female mice from the severe outcomes from IAV infection, it made them more susceptible to secondary challenge with a heterologous IAV, despite improving their antibody responses against a secondary IAV infection. Taken together, the immunomodulatory effects of progestins differentially regulate the outcome of infection depending on exposure history. The impact of hormone-based contraceptives on the outcome of infectious diseases outside the reproductive tract is rarely considered. Using a mouse model, we have made the novel observation that treatment with either progesterone or a synthetic analog found in hormonal contraceptives, , impacts sequential influenza A virus infection by modulating antibody responses and decreasing the numbers and activity of memory CD8 T cells. Progestins reduced the antibody responses during primary H1N1 virus infection but increased antibody titers following a sequential infection with either an H1N1 drift variant or an H3N2 virus. Following challenge with an H3N2 virus, female mice treated with progestins experienced greater mortality with increased pulmonary inflammation and reduced numbers and activity of CD8 T cells. This study suggests that progestins significantly affect adaptive immune responses to influenza A virus infection, with their effect on the outcome of infection depending on exposure history.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515745>Obesity and hormonal contraception: an overview and a clinician's practical guide.</a></h2><p>The growing prevalence of obesity among the fertile female population poses a considerable problem to contraceptive providers. Obese women, who are more at risk for venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular events due to their condition, might be at an even higher risk of developing thromboembolic events when on medical contraception. Combined hormonal contraceptives might be less effective in obese women and may lead to unacceptable metabolic side effects for this population. In addition, the lack of safety data for  loss drugs and the higher risk for complications during and after pregnancy require a close surveillance of the fertility status of obese patients.The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the available medical contraceptive options and to give the readers a practical guidance for a wise contraceptive choice with regards to obesity.A general literature review of peer-reviewed publications on the topic "obesity and contraception" was performed using the PubMed database.Nowadays, there are many useful tools that help clinicians in choosing among the wide range of therapeutic possibilities, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) Medical Eligibility Criteria for contraceptive use. Furthermore, the great diversity of hormonal contraceptive formulations (combined hormonal formulations; progestin-only methods) and active substances (different estrogens and progestins) allow physicians to tailor therapies to patients' clinical peculiarities.Long-acting reversible contraceptives [progestin-only implants, -intra-uterine devices (IUDs) and copper IUDs] and progestin-only methods in general are excellent options for many categories of patients, including obese ones.V, narrative review.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26447355>Endometrial Synovial-like Metaplasia Associated With -releasing Intrauterine System.</a></h2><p>The -releasing intrauterine system (L-IUS) is widely used in contraception and in the treatment of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, adenomyosis, and endometriosis. L-IUS is also increasingly considered in the management of endometrial neoplasia and its precursors. Histologic changes in the endometrium can be due to the effects of high-dose progestogen or may be caused by the local irritant or mechanical effects of an intrauterine foreign body. In the present study, we describe a novel endometrial alteration associated with L-IUS that most closely resembles synovial metaplasia reported at other extra-articular anatomic sites. Eleven cases were identified with a mean age of 49.6 yr. In most patients L-IUS was used for management of menorrhagia or endometrial hyperplasia. Endometrial synovial-like metaplasia was always a focal finding and was associated with areas of surface epithelial erosion. The synovial-like cells showed a distinctive palisaded arrangement with orientation perpendicular to the endometrial surface. Multinucleate cells were present in 2 cases, but granulomas were not identified. The synovial-like cells were vimentin immunoreactive and a variable proportion of cells expressed CD68. Only focal CD10 staining was seen and there was no expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or cytokeratin. In summary, L-IUS may be associated with a distinctive synovial-like metaplastic alteration which most likely represents a stromal reaction to an intrauterine foreign body following endometrial surface erosion. The synovial-like cells appear to comprise histiocytes and modified fibroblasts or stromal cells similar to this process in other sites.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7956212>Blood pressure changes and hormonal contraceptives.</a></h2><p>The effects of low-estrogen and progestogen-only contraceptives on blood pressure changes were investigated on 238 women taking 35 micrograms EE OC, 267 using Norplant implants and 259 adopting IUD.

This study was designed to prove the efficacy of the long-acting testosterone undecanoate ester (TU) alone or in combination with oral  (LNG) in a phase II clinical trial.Twenty-eight healthy men were randomized to receive injections of 1000 mg TU every 6 weeks in combination with daily oral LNG (250 microg) or daily oral placebo treatment over a period of 24 weeks, followed by a control period of 28 weeks.During the course of the study semen analysis, reproductive hormone analysis, analysis of clinical chemistry and  parameters, well-being and sexual function, sonography of scrotal contents and prostate were performed.Marked suppression of gonadotrophins in both treatment groups resulted in azoospermia in 8/14 and 7/14 volunteers and severe oligozoospermia (< 3 x 1012/l) in 4/14 and 7/14 in the placebo and gestagen treated groups, respectively. Time to induction of azoospermia (mean +/- SEM) was not significantly different between the placebo (week 19.5 +/- 2.2) and LNG groups (week 15.4 +/- 2.2). During the whole treatment period mean testosterone serum concentrations remained within normal limits. Although not significant, it was evident that volunteers who became azoospermic had a better suppression of gonadotrophins and lower SHBG levels during treatment compared to non-azoospermic volunteers. Despite better gonadotrophin suppression in the LNG group no significant differences compared to placebo could be observed in the extent and kinetics of suppression of spermatogenesis, thus not demonstrating a major beneficial effect of LNG in the combination with injectable TU. Treatment led in both groups to a decrease of HDL and Lp(a) which was more pronounced in the LNG group (P > 0.05).Treatment with 1000 mg testosterone undecanoate injected at 6 weekly intervals or in combination with  showed suppression of spermatogenesis comparable to weekly injections of 200 mg testosterone enanthate.

The primary outcome was the proportion of women in each group who stopped bleeding during therapy and continued to report no bleeding at the end of therapy. Prespecified secondary outcomes were number of days until temporary interruption of bleeding occurred, number of days without bleeding during therapy, and number of days to recurrence of bleeding after discontinuation of therapy.

Synthetic progestins are components of human contraceptive and hormone replacement pharmaceuticals. Both progestogens and progestins enter the environment through a number of sources, and have been shown to cause profound effects on reproductive health in various aquatic vertebrates. Progestins are designed to bind human progesterone receptors, but they also have been shown to strongly activate androgen receptors in fish.  (LNG) activates fish androgen receptors and induces development of male secondary sex characteristics in females of other species. Although behavior has been postulated to be a sensitive early indicator of exposure to certain environmental contaminants, no such research on the reproductive behavior of gestagen-exposed fish has been conducted to date. The goal of our study was to examine the exposure effects of a human contraceptive progestin, LNG, on the reproductive development and behavior of the viviparous eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). Internal fertilization is a requisite characteristic of viviparous species, and is enabled by an androgen driven elongation of the anal fin into the male gonopodium (i.e., phallus). In this study, we exposed adult mosquitofish to ethanol (EtOH control), 10ng/L, and 100ng/L LNG for 8d using a static replacement exposure design. After 8d, a subset of males and females from each treatment were examined for differences in the 4:6 anal fin ratio. In addition, paired social interaction trials were performed using individual control males and control females or females treated 10ng/L or 100ng/L LNG. Female mosquitofish exposed to LNG were masculinized as evidenced by the elongation of the anal fin rays, a feature normal to males and abnormal to females. LNG caused significant increases in the 4:6 anal fin ratios of female mosquitofish in both the 10ng/L and 100ng/L treatments, although these differences were not significant between the two treatments. LNG caused significant increases in the 4:6 anal fin ratio of males exposed to 100ng/L, with no effects observed in the 10ng/L treatment. In addition, the reproductive behavior of control males paired with female mosquitofish exposed to 100ng/L LNG was also altered, for these males spent more time exhibiting no reproductive behavior, had decreased attending behavior, and a lower number of gonopodial thrusts compared to control males paired to control female mosquitofish. Given the rapid effects on both anal fin morphology and behavior observed in this study, the mosquitofish is an excellent sentinel species for the detection of exposure to LNG and likely other 19-nortestosterone derived contraceptive progestins in the environment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Only a few studies explore the effect of progestogen treatment in a mixture as opposed to individual chemicals to shed light on how non-target species respond to these contaminants. In the present study, we used an invertebrate model species, Lymnaea stagnalis, exposed to a mixture of four progestogens (progesterone, , drospirenone, and gestodene) in 10ng/L concentration for 3 weeks. Data at both physiological and cellular/molecular level were analyzed using the ELISA technique, stereomicroscopy combined with time lapse software, and capillary microsampling combined with mass spectrometry. The treatment of adult Lymnaeas caused reduced egg production, and low quality egg mass on the first week, compared to the control. Starting from the second week, the egg production, and the quality of egg mass were similar in both groups. At the end of the third week, the egg production and the vitellogenin-like protein content of the hepatopancreas were significantly elevated in the treated group. At the cellular level, accelerated cell proliferation was observed during early embryogenesis in the treated group. The investigation of metabolomic changes resulted significantly elevated hexose utilization in the single-cell zygote cytoplasm, and elevated adenylate energy charge in the egg albumen. These changes suggested that treated snails provided more hexose in the eggs in order to improve offspring viability.

Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either an OC (ethinyl estradiol [E2] 20 microg and  100 microg) or a matching placebo for 3 months. Participants used their usual pain medications as needed during the trial. The main outcome measure was score on the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (pain subscale) for the third menstrual cycle on treatment. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity (rated 0 to 10), days of any pain, days of severe pain, hours of pain on worst day, and use of pain medications.The mean Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire pain score was lower (less pain) in the OC group than the placebo group (3.1, standard deviation 3.2 compared with 5.8, standard deviation 4.5, P = .004, 95% confidence interval for the difference between means 0.88-4.53). By cycle 3, OC users rated their worst pain as less (mean pain rating 3.7 compared with 5.4, P = .02) and used fewer pain medications than placebo users (mean pain pills used 1.3 compared with 3.7, P = .05). By cycle 3, OC users reported fewer days of any pain, fewer days of severe pain, and fewer hours of pain on the worst pain day than placebo users; however, these differences did not reach statistical significance.Among adolescents, a low-dose oral contraceptive relieved dysmenorrhea-associated pain more effectively than placebo.I.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2146499>The effects of different formulations of oral contraceptive agents on  and carbohydrate .</a></h2><p>Oral contraceptives can induce changes in  and carbohydrate  similar to those associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, including increased serum triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and insulin levels and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. In this study, we examined whether modification of the type or dose of progestin in oral-contraceptive preparations diminishes these changes.We measured plasma lipoprotein levels and performed oral glucose-tolerance tests in a cross section of 1060 women who took one of nine types of oral contraceptives for at least three months and 418 women who took none. Seven of the contraceptive formulations contained various doses and types of progestin:  in low (150 micrograms), high (250 micrograms), and triphasic (50 to 125 micrograms) doses; norethindrone in low (500 micrograms), high (1000 micrograms), and triphasic (500 to 1000 micrograms) doses; and a new progestin, desogestrel, in one dose (150 micrograms). All seven contained 30 to 40 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol. Two additional formulations contained progestin alone.As compared with controls, women taking combination drugs did not have increased serum total cholesterol levels but did have increases of 13 to 75 percent in fasting triglyceride levels. Levels of LDL cholesterol were reduced by 14 percent in women taking the combination containing desogestrel and by 12 percent in those taking low-dose norethindrone. Levels of HDL cholesterol were lowered by 5 percent and 16 percent by the combinations containing low-dose and high-dose , respectively; these decreases were due to reductions of 29 percent and 43 percent, respectively, in the levels of HDL subclass 2. The combination pill containing high-dose norethindrone did not affect HDL cholesterol levels, whereas that containing low-dose norethindrone increased HDL cholesterol levels by 10 percent. The desogestrel combination increased HDL cholesterol levels by 12 percent. Levels of apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, and B were generally increased by combination drugs. Depending on the dose and type of progestin, combination drugs were associated with plasma glucose levels on the glucose-tolerance test that were 43 to 61 percent higher than in controls, insulin responses 12 to 40 percent higher, and C-peptide responses 18 to 45 percent higher. Progestin-only formulations had only minor metabolic effects.The appropriate dose and type of progestin may reduce the adverse effects of oral contraceptives on many metabolic markers of risk for coronary heart disease.

The progesterone receptor (PR) is one of the treatment targets in breast cancer, and can be blocked with selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs). Since administration of chemical drugs can cause serious side effects, and patients, especially those undergoing long-term treatment, can suffer harmful consequences, there is an urgent need to discover novel potent drugs. Large-scale structural diversity is a feature of natural compounds. Accordingly, in the present study, we selected a library of 20,000 natural compounds from the ZINC database, and screened them against the PR for binding affinity and efficacy. In addition, we evaluated the pharmacodynamics and ADMET properties of the compounds and performed molecular docking. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out in order to examine the stability of the protein. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to study the motions of the protein. Finally, the MMPBSA method was applied in order to estimate the binding free . Our docking results reveal that compounds ZINC00936598, ZINC00869973 and ZINC01020370 have the highest binding  into the PR binding site, comparable with that of  (positive control). Moreover, RMSD, RMSF, Rg and H-bond analysis demonstrate that the lead compounds preserve stability in complex with PR during simulation. Our PCA analysis results were in accordance with MD results and the binding free energies support the docking results. This study paves the way for discovery of novel drugs from natural sources and with optimal efficacy, targeting the PR.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of POC use on cardiometabolic outcomes including venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and diabetes. Methods and results Nineteen observational studies (seven cohort and 12 case-control) were included in this systematic review. Of those, nine studies reported the risk of venous thromboembolism, six reported the risk of myocardial infarction, six reported the risk of stroke, three reported the risk of hypertension and two studies reported the risk of developing diabetes with POC use. The pooled adjusted relative risks (RRs) for venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction and stroke for oral POC users versus non-users based on the random effects model were 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-1.62), 0.98 (95% CI 0.66-1.47) and 1.02 (95% CI 0.72-1.44), respectively. Stratified analysis by route of administration showed that injectable POC with a RR of 2.62 (95% CI 1.74-3.94), but not oral POCs (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.7-1.62), was associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. A decreased risk of venous thromboembolism in a subgroup of women using an intrauterine  device was observed with a RR of 0.53 (95% CI 0.32-0.89). No effect of POC use on blood pressure was found, but there was an indication for an increased risk of diabetes with injectable POCs, albeit non-significant. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that oral POC use is not associated with an increased risk of developing various cardiometabolic outcomes, whereas injectable POC use might increase the risk of venous thromboembolism.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23262424>Formulation and optimization of desogestrel transdermal contraceptive patch using crystallization studies.</a></h2><p> (LNG) is the most commonly used progestin in contraception.

Crystallization studies were used to select the best adhesive among acrylate (Duro-Tak 87-4098 and Duro-Tak 87-202A) and polyisobutylene (PIB, Duro-Tak 87-608A) pressure sensitive adhesives by determining the drug's saturation solubility in them. The use of copovidone and mineral oil as formulation excipients was investigated to increase drug loading in the PIB adhesive. Physical characterization of the patches was performed using in vitro drug release, content analysis, patch  and thickness variations and rolling ball tack and peel adhesion studies. Optimized patches were evaluated for in vitro transdermal delivery across hairless rat skin. The saturation solubility of desogestrel was found to be approximately 49.3% (w/w) and 55.6% (w/w) in Duro-Tak 87-4098 and Duro-Tak 87-202A acrylate adhesives, respectively. The saturation solubility of desogestrel was significantly lower (3-4%, w/w) in the PIB adhesive. Mineral oil (10%, w/w) and copovidone (30%, w/w) were found to be optimum for increasing drug loading and patch cosmetics.

To explore a new approach to its management capable of preserving future fertility, the molecular pathology of ovarian endometrioma is reviewed and mechanisms by which the endometrioma progressively affects the ovary during reproductive life are summarized. The scope of new therapeutic modalities includes restoring the progesterone receptor ratio using progestin or progesterone receptor modulators and decreasing local oestrogen production through an aromatase inhibitor. In addition, free radical production can be blocked by antioxidants and the autophagic process by increasing apoptosis. Finally, metalloproteinases and relaxin activity, as well as the inflammatory process can be controlled. Many of these pharmacological treatments lend themselves to local administration and can be applied through intracystic drug administration; in fact, the intracystic route has already been tried with recombinant interleukin-2, methotrexate and ethanol; the latter to obtain sclerotization. Specifically, it is proposed that endometrial growth in the endometrioma is suppressed by intra-cystic application of synthetic progestins, such as  or danazol, selective progesterone receptor modulators, such as mifepristone, ulipristal or asoprisnil, without affecting ovarian activity.Copyright © 2016 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

EE and LNG PK parameters were characterized for 168 h at the end of Cycle 1. During cycle 2, biweekly outpatient visits were performed to assess cervical mucus, monitor ovarian activity with transvaginal ultrasound and obtain serum samples to measure EE, LNG, estradiol and progesterone levels. PK parameters were calculated and correlated with end-organ activity and compared against control samples obtained from normal and obese women sampled up to 48 h in a previous study. Standard determination of PK accuracy was performed, defined by the dependency on extrapolated values ('excess' area under the curve of 25% or less).The mean BMI was 39.4 kg/m2 (SD 6.6) with a range of 30-64 kg/m2. Key LNG PK parameters were as follows: clearance, 0.52 L/h (SD 0.24); half-life, 65 h (SD 40); area under the curve (AUC), 232 h*ng/mL (SD 102); and time to reach steady state, 13.6 days (SD 8.4). The majority of subjects had increased ovarian activity with diameter of follicles ≥8 mm (n=25), but only seven women had follicles ≥10 mm plus cervical mucus scores ≥5. Evidence of poor end-organ suppression did not correlate with the severity of the alterations in PK. As compared to historical normal and obese controls (48-h PK sampling), clearance, half-life, AUC and time to reach steady state were found to be significantly different (p≤.05) in obese women undergoing a longer duration of PK sampling (168 h). Longer sampling also improved PK accuracy for obese women (excess AUC 20%) as compared to both normal and obese controls undergoing shorter sampling times (48 h) with excess AUCs of 25% and 50%, respectively.Obesity results in significant alterations in OC steroid PK parameters, but the severity of these alterations did not correlate with end-organ suppression.

All women 15-44 years old, suffering a first ever deep venous thrombosis or a first pulmonary embolism (PE) during the period January 1, 1994, to December 30, 1998, were included. Controls were selected annually, 600 per year in 1994-1995 and 1200 per year 1996-1998. Response rates for cases and controls were 87.2% and 89.7%, respectively. After exclusion of nonvalid diagnoses, pregnant women, and women with previous thrombotic disease, 987 cases and 4054 controls were available for analysis. A multivariate, matched analysis was performed. Controls were matched to cases within 1-year age bands. Adjustment was made for confounding influence (if any) from the following variables: age, year, body mass index, length of OC use, family history of VTE, cerebral thrombosis or myocardial infarction, coagulopathies, , years of schooling, and previous birth. The risk of VTE among current users of OCs was primarily influenced by duration of use, with significantly decreasing odds ratios (OR) over time: <1 year, 7.0 (5.1-9.6); 1-5 years, 3.6 (2.7-4.8); and >5 years, 3.1 (2.5-3.8), all compared with nonusers of OCs. After adjustment for confounders, current use of OCs with second- ( or norgestimate) and third- (desogestrel or gestodene) generation progestins when compared with nonuse resulted in ORs for VTE of 2.9 (2.2-3.8) and 4.0 (3.2-4.9), respectively. After adjusting for progestin types and length of use, the risk decreased significantly with decreasing estrogen dose.

Patient satisfaction for the two OCPs was similar and high. The rates of side effects were low.It seems that the monophasic and triphasic pills are similar according to patient satisfaction and side effects; therefore there is no benefit of one over the other except for BTB/S, for which triphasic is superior.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This results in  and scarring, causing pain and impaired quality of life. Endometriotic lesions can be excised or ablated surgically, but the risk of recurrence is high. A Heath Technology Assessment commissioning call in 2011 sought applications for trials aimed at evaluating long-term effectiveness of postoperative, long-acting, reversible contraceptives (LARCs) in preventing recurrence of endometriosis. A survey of gynaecologists indicated that there was no consensus about which LARC ( Intrauterine System (LNG-IUS) or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (DMPA)) or comparator (combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) or no treatment) should be evaluated. Hence, we designed a 'flexible-entry' internal pilot to assess whether a four-arm trial was feasible including a possible design adaption based on pilot findings.In this pilot, women could be randomised to two, three or four treatment options provided that one was a LARC and one was a non-LARC. An assessment of feasibility based on recruitment to these options and a revised substantive trial design was considered by an independent oversight committee.The study ran for 1 year from April 2014 and 77 women were randomised. Only 5 (6%) women accepted randomisation to all groups, with 63 (82%) having a LARC preference and 55 (71%) a non-LARC preference. Four-way and three-way designs were ruled out with a two-way LARC versus COCP design, stratified by prerandomisation choice of LARC and optional subrandomisation to LNG-IUS versus DMPA considered a feasible substantive study.Multi-arm studies are potentially efficient as they can answer multiple questions simultaneously but are difficult to recruit to if there are strong patient or clinician preferences. A flexible approach to randomisation in a pilot phase can be used to assess feasibility of such studies and modify a trial design based on chosen recruitment options, but trialists should consider carefully any practical arrangements should groups need to be dropped during a study.International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number, ISRCTN97865475 .

The development of progestins has been influenced in a major way by the search for orally active hormonal contraceptives, since it is likely that hormonal contraceptives will continue to utilize a progestin, the only possible alternative being represented by the utilization of antiprogestins. Synthetic progestogens in clinical use today belong to three main chemical families: progesterone derivatives (progesterone, retro-progesterone, 19-norprogesterone and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone); gonane and 19-nortestosterone derivatives (norethisterone, , desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate); a spironolactone derivative. Biological potency of progestogens varies depending on the end-point measured, usually ovulation inhibition and endometrial transformation; with both these tests, the most active compounds are all gonane derivatives, with a potency over a 100 times that of the natural hormone. When administered in adequate doses, a progestin inhibits fertility by inhibiting ovulation. This action is mainly exerted at the hypothalamic level where, physiologically, progesterone decreases the number of LH pulses. When progestogens are delivered directly to the uterine cavity, their action seems to be purely local. It has been amply proven that--even when administered in doses that do not constantly inhibit ovulation--a progestin can still remain effective as a contraceptive by acting at the level of the cervical mucus and, at least in part, of the endometrium. Progestogens utilized today differ largely in their pharmacokinetics. In general, after intake, these compounds are rapidly absorbed and distributed so that peak serum concentrations are reached between 1 and 4 h. Third-generation progestins (desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate) have common characteristics: a higher affinity for progesterone receptors than their predecessors, a lower affinity for androgen receptors, a higher selectivity of action, a higher central inhibitory activity, a higher potency at the level of the endometrium, and an overall metabolic neutrality, in terms of effects on  and carbohydrate . In general, progestins can induce two types of adverse effects: changes in  and bleeding irregularities. Whereas the newer compounds seem to have overcome the first of these adverse effects, the second remains untouched: to this day, proper cycle control can only be achieved with combined hormonal contraceptives.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1832625>Characteristics of the new progestogens in combination oral contraceptives.</a></h2><p>This review details the characteristic features of three new progestogens which soon will be available in low-dose combination oral contraceptive agents in the United States.

The risk-to-benefit ratio must be examined individually by the woman and her health care provider.Implementation of this guideline should optimize the decision-making process of women and their health care providers in proceeding with further investigation or therapy for uterine leiomyomas, having considered the disease process and available treatment options, and reviewed the risks and anticipated benefits.Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews in February 2013, using appropriate controlled vocabulary (uterine fibroids, myoma, leiomyoma, myomectomy, myolysis, heavy menstrual bleeding, and menorrhagia) and key words (myoma, leiomyoma, fibroid, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, hysterectomy, heavy menstrual bleeding, menorrhagia). The reference lists of articles identified were also searched for other relevant publications. Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no date limits but results were limited to English or French language materials. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to January 2014. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, and national and international medical specialty societies.The majority of fibroids are asymptomatic and require no intervention or further investigations. For symptomatic fibroids such as those causing menstrual abnormalities (e.g. heavy, irregular, and prolonged uterine bleeding), iron defficiency anemia, or bulk symptoms (e.g., pelvic pressure/pain, obstructive symptoms), hysterectomy is a definitive solution. However, it is not the preferred solution for women who wish to preserve fertility and/or their uterus. The selected treatment should be directed towards an improvement in symptomatology and quality of life. The cost of the therapy to the health care system and to women with fibroids must be interpreted in the context of the cost of untreated disease conditions and the cost of ongoing or repeat investigative or treatment modalities.The quality of evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Caadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1). Summary Statements 1. Uterine fibroids are common, appearing in 70% of women by age 50; the 20% to 50% that are symptomatic have considerable social and economic impact in Canada. (II-3) 2. The presence of uterine fibroids can lead to a variety of clinical challenges. (III) 3. Concern about possible complications related to fibroids in pregnancy is not an indication for myomectomy except in women who have had a previous pregnancy with complications related to these fibroids. (III) 4. Women who have fibroids detected in pregnancy may require additional maternal and fetal surveillance. (II-2) 5. Effective medical treatments for women with abnormal uterine bleeding associated with uterine fibroids include the  intrauterine system, (I) gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, (I) selective progesterone receptor modulators, (I) oral contraceptives, (II-2) progestins, (II-2) and danazol. (II-2) 6. Effective medical treatments for women with bulk symptoms associated with fibroids include selective progesterone receptor modulators and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues. (I) 7. Hysterectomy is the most effective treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids. (III) 8. Myomectomy is an option for women who wish to preserve their uterus or enhance fertility, but carries the potential for further intervention. (II-2) 9. Of the conservative interventional treatments currently available, uterine artery embolization has the longest track record and has been shown to be effective in properly selected patients. (II-3) 10. Newer focused  delivery methods are promising but lack long-term data. (III) Recommendations 1. Women with asymptomatic fibroids should be reassured that there is no evidence to substantiate major concern about malignancy and that hysterectomy is not indicated. (III-D) 2. Treatment of women with uterine leiomyomas must be individualized based on symptomatology, size and location of fibroids, age, need and desire of the patient to preserve fertility or the uterus, the availability of therapy, and the experience of the therapist. (III-B) 3. In women who do not wish to preserve fertility and/or their uterus and who have been counselled regarding the alternatives and risks, hysterectomy by the least invasive approach possible may be offered as the definitive treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids and is associated with a high level of satisfaction. (II-2A) 4. Hysteroscopic myomectomy should be considered first-line conservative surgical therapy for the management of symptomatic intracavitary fibroids. (II-3A) 5. Surgical planning for myomectomy should be based on mapping the location, size, and number of fibroids with the help of appropriate imaging. (III-A) 6. When morcellation is necessary to remove the specimen, the patient should be informed about possible risks and complications, including the fact that in rare cases fibroid(s) may contain unexpected malignancy and that laparoscopic power morcellation may spread the cancer, potentially worsening their prognosis. (III-B) 7. Anemia should be corrected prior to proceeding with elective surgery. (II-2A) Selective progesterone receptor modulators and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues are effective at correcting anemia and should be considered preoperatively in anemic patients. (I-A) 8. Use of vasopressin, bupivacaine and epinephrine, misoprostol, peri-cervical tourniquet, or gelatin-thrombin matrix reduce blood loss at myomectomy and should be considered. (I-A) 9. Uterine artery occlusion by embolization or surgical methods may be offered to selected women with symptomatic uterine fibroids who wish to preserve their uterus. Women choosing uterine artery occlusion for the treatment of fibroids should be counselled regarding possible risks, including the likelihood that fecundity and pregnancy may be impacted. (II-3A) 10. In women who present with acute uterine bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, conservative management with estrogens, selective progesterone receptor modulators, antifibrinolytics, Foley catheter tamponade, and/or operative hysteroscopic intervention may be considered, but hysterectomy may become necessary in some cases. In centres where available, intervention by uterine artery embolization may be considered.

The use of oral ethinylestradiol- (EEL) formulation is also common among young women worldwide. The present study aimed at determining the effect of EEL on high fructose-induced cardiac triglyceride (TG) and glycogen accumulation. The study also investigated the possible involvement of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4) in EEL and/or high fructose  effects on the heart. Ten-week-old female Wistar rats were allotted into four groups. The control, EEL, FRU, and EEL + FRU rats received distilled water (vehicle, p.o.), 1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg  (p.o.), 10% fructose (w/v), and 1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg  and 10% fructose, respectively, daily for 8 weeks. Data showed that EEL or high fructose caused IR' impaired glucose tolerance' hyperlipidemia' increased plasma lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, PDK-4, uric acid, xanthine oxidase (XO), adenosine deaminase (ADA), malondialdehyde (MDA), cardiac uric acid, TG, TG/HDL- cholesterol, glycogen synthesis, MDA, and visceral fat content and reduced glutathione. High fructose also resulted in impaired pancreatic β-cell function, hyperglycemia, and increased cardiac PDK-4, lactate synthesis, and mass. Nonetheless, these alterations were ameliorated in EEL plus high fructose rats. This study demonstrates that high fructose-induced myocardial TG and glycogen accumulation is attributable to increased PDK-4. Besides, EEL could be a useful pharmacological utility for protection against cardiac dysmetabolism by inhibiting PDK-4.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance', 'metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490289>Maintaining physiologic testosterone levels during combined oral contraceptives by adding dehydroepiandrosterone: II. Effects on sexual function. A phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.</a></h2><p>The objective was to evaluate the effect of combined oral contraceptives (OCs) on sexual function, either alone or together with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).An exploratory randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative, crossover study was conducted in 81 OC users. Subjects discontinued their OC for one cycle before being randomized for 10cycles to a 30-mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE)/ (LNG) OC or a 30-mcg EE/drospirenone (DRSP) OC, along with daily use of 50mg dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or placebo during five OC cycles before crossing over from DHEA to placebo or the reverse for another fivecycles. First, the effect on sexual function of five OC cycles + placebo was compared to baseline. Then, the effect of five OC cycles + DHEA was compared to the OC+placebo. Results regarding endocrine changes have been published separately. Primary efficacy outcomes of the current study were genital response (measured by vaginal pulse amplitude [VPA]) and sexual feelings (measured by the subjective self-assessment questionnaire [SSAQ]) to self-induced erotic fantasy and visual sexual stimuli in a laboratory setting and measures of desire and arousability using a sexual function diary (SFD). Secondary efficacy outcomes were the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale Revised.Eighty-one women were enrolled, and 74 women completed the study. Five cycles of OC+placebo resulted in a significant decline compared to baseline of four out of six SFD self-ratings of sexual desire and arousability with both OCs. The LNG OC also resulted in significant declines in the FSFI scores (baseline vs. LNG OC+placebo: total score, 28.7±3.7 vs. 25.6±7.4; arousal, 5.0±0.7 vs. 4.5±1.4; lubrication, 5.2±0.9 vs. 4.6±1.7; pain, 4.9±0.9 vs. 4.5±1.4), but no changes were observed using the DRSP OC. In the laboratory setting, five cycles of OC+DHEA showed no significant differences with placebo except for a significant increase in genital sensations (SSAQ) during erotic fantasy (OC+placebo vs. OC+DHEA: 3.3±1.4 vs. 3.6±1.5; p<.05). No significant changes were observed for genital response (VPA) and the other two variables of the SSAQ assessed after visual erotic stimulus exposure. Using the SFD, 5 out of 10 variables showed a significant improvement with DHEA. Partner's initiative was rejected less often with OC+DHEA compared to placebo (OC+placebo vs. OC+DHEA: 1.1±1.5 vs. 0.8±1.0; p<.05). Women with free testosterone levels in the upper quartile during DHEA co-administration showed significantly better effects on sexual arousal and desire compared to the three lower quartiles (lower vs. upper quartiles: sexual arousability: 25.0±19.8 vs. 41.2±29.0; sexual desire: 5.6±3.7 vs. 9.6±8.0; desire for sex with partner: 4.9±3.1 vs. 8.6±7.4; number of sex fantasies: 3.0±3.2 vs. 5.5±4.4; all p<.05).In this exploratory study, OC use was associated with decreases in some measures of sexual functioning, whereas others remained unchanged. Maintaining or restoring physiological testosterone concentrations by the co-administration of DHEA to the OC may prevent these effects on sexuality, particularly in women with relatively high but physiologic levels of free testosterone during DHEA co-administration.The results of this exploratory study warrant further testing of the hypothesis that restoration and/or preservation of physiologic testosterone levels during OC use by co-administration of DHEA has favorable effects on those aspects of sexual function compromised by OCs.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Although observational studies identify DMPA as an important STI risk factor, mechanisms underlying this connection are undefined.  (LNG) is another progestin used for hormonal contraception, but its effect on STI susceptibility is much less explored. Using a mouse model of genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, we herein found that DMPA and LNG similarly reduced genital expression of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-1α (DSG1α), enhanced access of inflammatory cells to genital tissue by increasing mucosal epithelial permeability, and increased susceptibility to viral infection. Additional studies with uninfected mice revealed that DMPA-mediated increases in mucosal permeability promoted tissue inflammation by facilitating endogenous vaginal  invasion. Conversely, concomitant treatment of mice with DMPA and intravaginal estrogen restored mucosal barrier function and prevented HSV-2 infection. Evaluating ectocervical biopsy tissue from women before and 1 month after initiating DMPA remarkably revealed that inflammation and barrier protection were altered by treatment identically to changes seen in progestin-treated mice. Together, our work reveals DMPA and LNG diminish the genital mucosal barrier; a first-line defense against all STI, but may offer foundation for new contraceptive strategies less compromising of barrier protection.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'immunity', 'inflammation', 'metabolism', 'microbiome', 'microbiota']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27841046>Targeting mast cells: a new way to treat endometriosis.</a></h2><p>Endometriosis is a chronic estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease of unclear etiology that affects 15-20% of women of reproductive age.

There is evidence that mast cells (MCs) play a role in this disease. This article summarizes recent achievements in preclinical studies and clinical activities investigating the role of MCs in endometriosis. Targeting MCs might offer new alternatives to treat this disease.

All relevant articles (34) found in PubMed were examined and their reference lists reviewed in order to pinpoint further studies for potential inclusion. Expert opinion: Since endometriosis is a multifactorial disease, and considering that numbers of MCs and activated MCs were clearly increased in endometriotic lesions in both animals and humans, use of MC stabilizers and inhibitors may prove to be effective to treat endometriosis and its associated pain. However, more data from preclinical studies and clinical trials will help to better define the status of MCs in the treatment of this pathology.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2142577>Effects of three combined oral contraceptive preparations containing desogestrel plus ethinyl estradiol on  in comparison with two  preparations.</a></h2><p>The effects of three different desogestrel-containing combined oral contraceptive preparations on  were compared with those of two  preparations.

Almost all synthetic progestogens are devoid of this antimineralocorticoid (anti-MC) effect. They are unable to antagonize the salt retaining effect of estrogens. This could be one cause of weight gain and an increase in blood pressure with the use of combined oral contraceptives (OC) and, in some susceptible women, with postmenopausal estrogen/(progestogen) treatment. The purpose of this presentation is to review results of clinical studies with drospirenone (DRSP), a new progestogen developed by Schering A.G., with anti-MCR activity. DRSP is a derivative of 17-alpha-spirolactone. In rats, rabbits and in man, it is a PR-agonist and an MCR- and androgen-R antagonist with no effect on the glucocorticoid-R and the estrogen-R. In normally menstruating women, 2-3mg DRSP per day, taken from day 5 to 25 of the cycle, inhibit ovulation, lead to a mild natriuresis, and a slight compensatory activation of the renin-aldosterone system. Compared with an OC containing 30 microg ethinylestradiol (EE) and 150 microg , a combination of 3mg DRSP with 30 microg EE given over 6 months led to a slight decrease in body weight and blood pressure. The reduction in mean body weight by a combination of DRSP with EE compared with a conventional OC could be confirmed in a study over 26 months in 900 young women. The OC containing DRSP has favorable effects in patients suffering from the premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and, partly due to the antiandrogenic effect of DRSP, in those with acne vulgaris. For postmenopausal women, a combination of DRSP with estradiol has been developed with the expectation that the slight blood pressure lowering and weight reducing effects will minimize cardiovascular morbidity in patients needing hormone treatment because of hot flushes and other climacteric symptoms.DRSP, by its anti-MCR effect and its potential to slightly decrease body weight and blood pressure, shares many pharmacodynamic properties with progesterone, and it is a candidate for reducing cardiovascular morbidity in women using OCs or postmenopausal hormone treatment.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9285331>Proliposome-based transdermal delivery of .</a></h2><p>Mesophasic proliposomal system for  was developed and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo.

Blood samples were taken on admission and at 3 and 12 months after pills or insertion of IUDs. Fasting glucose levels were decreased while 2h glucose and triglyceride were increased throughout the treatment period in NET/EE group [corrected]. LNG/EE group only showed significant increase of 2h glucose at 12 months and decrease of LDL cholesterol at 3 months while total cholesterol was significantly suppressed at 3 and 12 months [corrected]. The atherogenic index, LDL/HDL cholesterol was significantly reduced by 12 months. Both groups had no change in hemoglobin, hematocrit and total protein levels but alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and aspartate transaminase (SGOT) were suppressed. While NET/EE suppressed albumin significantly, this was not observed with LNG/EE group. However, these differences observed with use of each pill preparations, were not so obvious between treatment groups and control. Changes in total, HDL and LDL cholesterol and SGOT were not significantly different than the IUD group. Furthermore, except for 2h glucose, there was no increase in the number of abnormal parameters after treatment. On the contrary, there was a reduction of abnormal values in most liver function parameters.

Long-term intrauterine progestogens may offer an attractive alternative to oral therapy.To review the evidence regarding the efficacy of intrauterine -releasing systems (LNG-IUS) in preventing endometrial pathology in high-risk women.Searches were made of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, UK National Research Register (NRR) Archive, Current Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL. The selection criteria were randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LNG-IUS with no treatment, placebo or other hormonal therapy in adult females. Where no RCTs were available, prospective cohort studies were analyzed. Data was extracted using a standardized data collection form. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan software.There were six RCTs that investigated LNG-IUS in women using estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). LNG-IUS was at least as effective as other routes of progestogen administration. Only two studies investigated LNG-IUS as treatment for endometrial hyperplasia. Hyperplasia without atypia regressed in all women treated with LNG-IUS. In three studies of LNG-IUS in tamoxifen users, LNG-IUS was associated with reduced risk of endometrial polyps (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.55) and hyperplasia (Peto OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.02-0.80).LNG-IUS counters endometrial proliferation and causes regression of and prevents endometrial hyperplasia in selected groups of women.

These data were then related to a recent large international prospective, controlled, non-interventional cohort active surveillance study, on the cardiovascular risk of users of different types of combined estroprogestin contraceptive (CEPC).The crude HR for E2-valerate (E2V)/dienogest vs other CEPCs with EE was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.4-1.6), but when the data were corrected for age, body mass index, duration of use, and family history of VTE, the corresponding adjusted HR was 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2-1.0). A comparison of the E2V/dienogest and EE/ groups showed that the two contraceptives induced a similar VTE risk with the crude and adjusted VTE HRs of 0.7 (95% CI, 0.3-1.8) and 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2-1.3), respectively. Similar results were obtained when the observation was prolonged to January 2017.The reduced impact of E2 vs EE on coagulation translates into the epidemiologic evidence of a reduced number of events in E2V vs EE users, when progestins other than  are used. However, E2 may continue to negatively impact on the risk of VTE, and this should not be forgotten at the time of prescription. Family history of VTE or thrombophilia, age, and  are risk factors for VTE too. If these risk factors are not taken into consideration and excluded, they can overcome or hide the higher safety of E2 vs CEPCs with EE.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10496299>Clinical pharmacokinetics of troglitazone.</a></h2><p>Troglitazone is a new thiazolidinedione oral antidiabetic agent approved for use to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 . It is rapidly absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of between 40 and 50%. Food increases the absorption by 30 to 80%. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are linear over the clinical dosage range of 200 to 600 mg once daily. The mean elimination half-life ranges from 7.6 to 24 hours, which facilitates a once daily administration regimen. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are similar between patients with type 2  and healthy individuals. In humans, troglitazone undergoes metabolism by sulfation, glucuronidation and oxidation to form a sulfate conjugate (M1), glucuronide conjugate (M2) and quinone metabolite (M3), respectively. M1 and M3 are the major metabolites in plasma, and M2 is a minor metabolite. Age, gender, type 2 , renal impairment, smoking and race do not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of troglitazone and its 2 major metabolites. In patients with hepatic impairment the plasma concentrations of troglitazone, M1 and M3 increase by 30%, 4-fold, and 2-fold, respectively. Cholestyramine decreases the absorption of troglitazone by 70%. Troglitazone may enhance the activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and/or transporter(s) thereby reducing the plasma concentrations of terfenadine, cyclosporin, atorvastatin and fexofenadine. It also reduces the plasma concentrations of the oral contraceptive hormones ethinylestradiol, norethindrone and . Troglitazone does not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, glibenclamide (glyburide) or paracetamol (acetaminophen). There is no pharmacodynamic interaction between troglitazone and warfarin or alcohol (ethanol). Pharmacodynamic modelling showed that improvement in fasting glucose and triglyceride levels increased with dose from 200 to 600 mg. Knowledge of systemic troglitazone exposure within a dose group does not improve the prediction of glucose lowering response or adverse effects beyond those based on the administered dose.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21722110>In vivo treatment with progestogens causes immunosuppression of carp Cyprinus carpio leucocytes by affecting nitric oxide production and arginase activity.</a></h2><p>In this study, carp Cyprinus carpio were injected with various steroid compounds, including synthetic and natural progestogens and the glucocorticoid cortisol, to investigate effects on leucocytes isolated from their kidneys.

Blood samples were taken by venipuncture after at least 12 h fasting on Days 21-26 of the control cycle and Days 18-21 of the first, third, and sixth treatment cycle. There were clear differences between the effects of EE/LNG and the formulations containing estrogens and DNG. Although EE/LNG did not change the triglycerides levels, a significant increase was observed during treatment with the DNG-containing preparations. Although EE/LNG significantly reduced HDL-CH and HDL(2)-CH, there was a nonsignificant increase with the DNG-containing OCs. No change was observed in the levels of HDL(3)-CH. A significant rise in apolipoprotein A1 occurred during intake with the three DNG-containing formulations, but not with EE/LNG. In contrast to the women treated with combinations of estrogens and DNG, apolipoprotein B rose significantly in the women in the EE/LNG group. Lipoprotein (a) was significantly reduced by 30 EE/DNG and EE/LNG and remained unaltered with 20 EE/DNG and EE/EV/DNG.

Estrogen-progestin therapy has been used as exogenous estrogen to normalize depressed estrogen level during menopause. Ovariectomized rodents mimic an estrogen-deficient state in that they develop cardiometabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance (IR). We therefore hypothesized that hormonal therapy with combined oral contraceptive steroids, ethinylestradiol- (EEL), improves IR, obesity, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) through reduction of circulating mineralocorticoid in ovariectomized rats. Twelve-week-old female Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: sham-operated (SHM) and ovariectomized (OVX) rats were treated with or without EEL (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ) daily for 8 weeks. Results showed that OVX or SHM + EEL treated rats had increased HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of IR), 1 h postload glucose, HOMA-β, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), TC/HDL cholesterol, TG/HDL cholesterol, plasma insulin, GSK-3, corticosterone, and aldosterone. On the other hand, OVX + EEL treatment ameliorated all these effects except that of aldosterone. Taken together, the results demonstrate that oral hormonal replacement with EEL improves IR and pancreatic β-cell function and suppresses GSK-3 and glucocorticoid independent of circulating aldosterone, suggesting a positive cardiometabolic effect of oral EEL therapy in estrogen-deficient rats.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'insulin resistance', 'metabolism', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308416>Oral contraceptive use increases risk of inflammatory and coagulatory disorders in women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: An observational study.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a multispectral disorder requiring lifelong management.

POCs include injectables, intrauterine contraception, implants, and oral contraceptives. Many POCs are long-acting, cost-effective methods of preventing pregnancy.

The primary outcome was mean change in  or mean change in  composition. We also considered the dichotomous outcome of loss or gain of a specified amount of .Two authors extracted the data. Non-randomized studies (NRS) need to control for confounding factors. We used adjusted  for the primary effects in NRS or the results of matched analysis from paired samples. If the report did not provide adjusted  for the primary analysis, we used unadjusted outcomes. For RCTs and NRS without adjusted , we computed the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous variables. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI.We found 22 eligible studies that included a total of 11,450 women. With 6 NRS added to this update, the review includes 17 NRS and 5 RCTs. By contraceptive method, the review has 16 studies of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), 4 of -releasing intrauterine contraception (LNG-IUC), 5 for implants, and 2 for progestin-only pills.Comparison groups did not differ significantly for  change or other  composition measure in 15 studies. Five studies with moderate or low quality evidence showed differences between study arms. Two studies of a six-rod implant also indicated some differences, but the evidence was low quality.Three studies showed differences for DMPA users compared with women not using a hormonal method. In a retrospective study,  gain (kg) was greater for DMPA versus copper (Cu) IUC in years one (MD 2.28, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.77), two (MD 2.71, 95% CI 2.12 to 3.30), and three (MD 3.17, 95% CI 2.51 to 3.83). A prospective study showed adolescents using DMPA had a greater increase in  fat (%) compared with a group not using a hormonal method (MD 11.00, 95% CI 2.64 to 19.36). The DMPA group also had a greater decrease in lean  mass (%) (MD -4.00, 95% CI -6.93 to -1.07). A more recent retrospective study reported greater mean increases with use of DMPA versus Cu IUC for  (kg) at years 1 (1.3 vs 0.2), 4 (3.5 vs 1.9), and 10 (6.6 vs 4.9).Two studies reported a greater mean increase in  fat mass (%) for POC users versus women not using a hormonal method. The method was LNG-IUC in two studies (reported means 2.5 versus -1.3; P = 0.029); (MD 1.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.75). One also studied a desogestrel-containing pill (MD 3.30, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.52). Both studies showed a greater decrease in lean  mass among POC users.We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low; more than half of the studies had low quality evidence. The main reasons for downgrading were lack of randomizations (NRS) and high loss to follow-up or early discontinuation.These 22 studies showed limited evidence of change in  or  composition with use of POCs. Mean  gain at 6 or 12 months was less than 2 kg (4.4 lb) for most studies. Those with multiyear data showed mean  change was approximately twice as much at two to four years than at one year, but generally the study groups did not differ significantly.

Up-regulation of aromatase expression has been demonstrated in endometriotic lesions and the use of oral aromatase inhibitors has been shown to reduce endometriosis-associated pelvic pain in small-scale clinical trials.This Phase 1, randomized, multicentre, parallel-group, three-arm, open-label study assessed the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of various IVRs intended for systemic drug delivery. After screening, healthy, ovulating women aged 18-35 years were randomized to use IVRs releasing one of the three ATZ/LNG dose combinations (in vitro nominal daily drug release rates on Day 29: ATZ/LNG 500 µg/20 µg [low dose], ATZ/LNG 1000 µg/30 µg [mid dose] or ATZ/LNG 1500 µg/40 µg [high dose]) for two consecutive 28-day wearing periods without a treatment break.Sixty women were included in the per protocol set. The primary variables were plasma concentrations of ATZ and LNG at the end of each treatment period and the mean size of largest follicle-like structures (FLSs) over 56 days. Serum concentrations of several hormones were also evaluated, with emphasis on E2 levels.At the end of the first treatment period, geometric mean plasma concentrations of LNG and ATZ, respectively, were 0.228 and 12.5 µg/l for the low dose, 0.269 and 19.8 µg/l for the mid dose and 0.384 and 37.3 µg/l for the high dose; results were similar at the end of the second treatment period. Over the entire treatment period, mean FLS sizes were higher in all three treatment groups than during the pretreatment cycle; more women in the mid- and high-dose groups had FLSs of at least 30 mm (32-45%) than those in the low-dose group (14-24%). Changes in the mean size of FLSs were similar to those reported for low-dose progestin-only oral contraceptives and generally resolved during the 2-month treatment period.

In this article, we summarize the current knowledge of the mode of action, wanted and unwanted side effects, and long-term risks of COCs. The  intrauterine device (IUD) and long-acting injectable or implantable monophasic progestogen preparations offer comparable contraceptive efficacy to COCs. Nonetheless, they are less frequently used in Germany than COCs, because of their propensity to cause breakthrough bleeding.Selective review of the literature.COCs suppress gonadotropin secretion and thereby inhibit follicular maturation and ovulation. Their correct use is associated with 0.3 pregnancies per 100 women per year, their typical use, with 1 pregnancy per 100 women per year (Pearl index). COCs have effects on the cardiovascular and hemostatic systems as well as on  and carbohydrate . When given in the presence of specific risk factors, they significantly increase the likelihood of cardiovascular disease and thromboembolism. Women with persistent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection who take COCs are at increased risk of developing invasive cervical cancer. On the other hand, COCs lower the cumulative incidence of endometrial and ovarian cancer by 30% to 50%, and that of colorectal cancer by 20% to 30%. Other malignancies seem to be unaffected by COC use.As long as personal and familial risk factors are carefully considered, COCs constitute a safe, reversible, and well-tolerated method of contraception.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12318530>A comparison of  implants with depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate injections for contraception.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9227183>The effect of oral contraceptive agents on the basal metabolic rate of young women.</a></h2><p>The use of oral contraceptive agents by women may be a factor that contributes to the observed inter-individual variability in the BMR. We, therefore, measured the BMR, body build and composition in two groups of young women and also assessed their self-reported level of physical activity. One group had been using oral contraceptive agents for a period of 6 months or more (OCA, n 24), while the other group had never used oral contraceptives (NOCA, n 22). There were no significant differences in age, body build or composition. The absolute BMR in the groups were not significantly different when compared using an unpaired t test (OCA: 5841 (SD 471) v. NOCA: 5633 (SD 615) kJ/d). However, using an analysis of covariance, with either body weight or a combination of  and  free mass as covariates, the OCA group had a BMR almost 5% higher than that of the NOCA group (OCA: 5871 v. NOCA: 5601 kJ/d; P = 0.002). When those subjects with high self-reported levels of physical activity were excluded, the difference in BMR between the two groups persisted (P = 0.001). An ANOVA of oral contraceptives use and phase of menstrual cycle showed significant differences in BMR with use of oral contraceptives (P = 0.004) but no difference in BMR between phases of the menstrual cycle. In conclusion, the use of oral contraceptive agents deserves consideration when conducting and analysing data from studies on energy  in young women, as it results in a significantly higher BMR.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1623718>Effect of Norplant-2 rods on liver,  and carbohydrate .</a></h2><p>The effect of Norplant-2 rods on liver,  and carbohydrate  was evaluated in 100 women using Norplant-2 rods.

The inclusion criteria were an age of ≥65 years, pathological confirmation of a uterine neoplasm, a Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) value of ≥4 and the presence of vaginal bleeding. Patients underwent intrauterine insertion of an LNG-IUD, and thereafter, received a total dose of 30 Gy at 3 Gy per fraction, over 10 days. The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as the uterus and disease-involved tissues in the pelvis plus a 1-cm margin. The planning target volume was obtained by adding a 1-cm isotropic margin to the CTV. A total of 9 patients with EC (median age, 85 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥2, ≥88.8%; , 55.5%; median CCI, 5) received an LNG-IUD plus RT. An early complete resolution of bleeding was documented in 8 patients (88.8%), while the remaining patient experienced a marked improvement. The median duration of bleeding control was 18 months, while the 2-year actuarial rate of bleeding-free survival was 53.3% (median follow-up time, 20 months; range, 9-60 months). No LNG-IUD- or severe RT-related complications were documented. Overall, a high rate of bleeding remission, durable bleeding-free survival in face of the easy intrauterine insertion of an LNG-IUD and a negligible toxicity profile of the complete treatment were documented in this study, indicating a requirement for further investigation in a larger series.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26908839>Gonadotropin suppression in men leads to a reduction in claudin-11 at the Sertoli cell tight junction.</a></h2><p>Are Sertoli cell tight junctions (TJs) disrupted in men undergoing hormonal contraception?Localization of the key Sertoli cell TJ protein, claudin-11, was markedly disrupted by 8 weeks of gonadotropin suppression, the degree of which was related to the extent of adluminal germ cell suppression.Sertoli cell TJs are vital components of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) that sequester developing adluminal meiotic germ cells and spermatids from the vascular compartment. Claudin-11 knockout mice are infertile; additionally claudin-11 is spatially disrupted in chronically gonadotropin-suppressed rats coincident with a loss of BTB function, and claudin-11 is disorganized in various human testicular disorders. These data support the Sertoli cell TJ as a potential site of hormonal contraceptive action.BTB proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry (n = 16 samples) and mRNA (n = 18 samples) expression levels in available archived testis tissue from a previous study of 22 men who had undergone 8 weeks of gonadotropin suppression and for whom meiotic and post-meiotic germ cell numbers were available. The gonadotropin suppression regimens were (i) testosterone enanthate (TE) plus the GnRH antagonist, acyline (A); (ii) TE + the progestin, , (LNG); (iii) TE + LNG + A or (iv) TE + LNG + the 5α-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride (D). A control group consisted of seven additional men, with three archived samples available for this study.Immunohistochemical localization of claudin-11 (TJ) and other junctional type markers [ZO-1 (cytoplasmic plaque), β-catenin (adherens junction), connexin-43 (gap junction), vinculin (ectoplasmic specialization) and β-actin (cytoskeleton)] and quantitative PCR was conducted using matched frozen testis tissue.Claudin-11 formed a continuous staining pattern at the BTB in control men. Regardless of gonadotropin suppression treatment, claudin-11 localization was markedly disrupted and was broadly associated with the extent of meiotic/post-meiotic germ cell suppression; claudin-11 staining was (i) punctate (i.e. 'spotty' appearance) at the basal aspect of tubules when the average numbers of adluminal germ cells were <15% of control, (ii) presented as short fragments with cytoplasmic extensions when numbers were 15-25% of control or (iii) remained continuous when numbers were >40% of control. Changes in localization of connexin-43 and vinculin were also observed (smaller effects than for claudin-11) but ZO-1, β-catenin and β-actin did not differ, compared with control.Claudin-11 was the only Sertoli cell TJ protein investigated, but it is considered to be the most pivotal of constituent proteins given its known implication in infertility and BTB function. We were limited to testis samples which had been gonadotropin-suppressed for 8 weeks, shorter than the 74-day spermatogenic wave, which may account for the heterogeneity in claudin-11 and germ cell response observed among the men. Longer suppression (12-24 weeks) is known to suppress germ cells further and claudin-11 disruption may be more uniform, although we could not access such samples.These findings are important for our understanding of the sites of action of male hormonal contraception, because they suggest that BTB function could be ablated following long-term hormone suppression treatment.National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) Program Grants 241000 and 494802; Research Fellowship 1022327 (to R.I.M.) and the Victorian Government's Operational Infrastructure Support Program.

A group of 177 Norplant implants acceptors was recruited in five centers (Bangkok, Jakarta, Mexico City, Singapore, and Stockholm) and monitored during one baseline menstrual cycle and 3, 5, 11, 16, and 22 months after implant insertion. They were compared with a group of 174 copper intrauterine (IUD) device users who had blood sampling performed at comparable time points.  changes were greatest 3 months after implant insertion and a slow reversal of these trends towards baseline was observed during the next 19 months. The main changes observed at 3 months were a 10% drop in total cholesterol, and an 11% drop in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI levels, together with a 19% decline in serum triglycerides. Variations in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels were not significantly different from those observed in the group of IUD users.

The 5 alpha-LNG had the same binding capacity to androgen receptors (AR) as LNG in male flank organs. The flank organ test demonstrated that 5 alpha-LNG activity was similar to that observed for  and testosterone (T) on gonadectomized male hamster flank organs. Topical applications of LNG or 5 alpha-LNG increased [U-14C]glucose incorporation into lipids in a way similar to that of T.

Because elevated endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) has been found in several studies to be a VTE risk factor, we evaluated the extent of ETP changes during the initial cycle of an ethinyl estradiol (EE) and  (LNG) COC. We also assessed the relationship between ETP changes and systemic EE and LNG concentrations.Participants provided multiple blood samples during a first 21-day cycle of a 30-mcg EE/150-mcg LNG COC and after a further 7 days without an active COC. Thrombin generation measured with and without addition of activated protein C (APC) yielded ETP and ETP and the normalized APC sensitivity ratio (nAPCsr). EE and LNG pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted over 24 h after the first COC tablet and again at steady state.Thrombin generation was determined in 16 of the 17 women who completed the study. Mean ETP increased steadily to 21% above baseline at 24 h after the 6th COC tablet (COC6; p<.001) and to 28% above baseline at steady state (COC21; p<.001). The percentage increase in mean ETP was considerably more - 54% at COC6 and 79% at steady state. Mean nAPCsr increased by 28% at COC6 and by 41% at steady state. Higher concentrations of EE or LNG were not correlated with greater increases in ETP.ETP increases during the first COC cycle were substantial.The early increases in ETP may provide biological support for the rapid increase in VTE risk during initial COC use. The lack of association between this clotting system perturbation and the systemic EE concentration is surprising and deserves further study.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We examined provider and clinical setting characteristics and clinic patient demographics for association with provider misconceptions about safety of combined oral contraceptives (COCs), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), or intrauterine devices (IUDs) for women with obesity. If providers considered methods as unsafe or do not know, we categorized those responses as misconceptions. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).A substantial proportion of respondents had misconceptions about the safety of COCs (31%), DMPA (24%), copper (Cu) (18%), and  (LNG)-IUDs (16%) for women with obesity. Provider type was associated with increased odds of misconceptions for all four methods compared with office-based obstetrician/gynecologists. Not having the method available onsite was associated with safety misconceptions of DMPA (aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.07-3.36), Cu-IUD (aOR 4.19, 95% CI 1.51-11.61), and LNG-IUD (aOR 5.25, 95% CI 1.67-16.49).While the majority of providers considered all four contraceptive methods safe for women with obesity, substantial proportions had misconceptions about safety of COCs, DMPA, and IUDs.

Here, we studied the effects of both the menstrual cycle and oral contraceptives (OCs) on amygdala and salience network resting-state functional connectivity using a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled design. Hormone levels, depressive symptoms, and resting-state functional connectivity were measured in 35 healthy women (24.9±4.2 years) who had previously experienced OC-related negative affect. All participants were examined in the follicular phase of a baseline cycle and in the third week of the subsequent cycle during treatment with either a combined OC (30 μg ethinyl estradiol/0.15 mg ) or placebo. The latter time point targeted the midluteal phase in placebo users and steady-state ethinyl estradiol and  concentrations in OC users. Amygdala and salience network connectivity generally increased with both higher endogenous and synthetic hormone levels, although amygdala-parietal cortical connectivity decreased in OC users. When in the luteal phase, the naturally cycling placebo users demonstrated higher connectivity in both  compared with the women receiving OCs. Our results support a causal link between the exogenous administration of synthetic hormones and amygdala and salience network connectivity.

The hormonal approach is based on suppression of gonadotropins and thus of testicular function and spermatogenesis, and has been investigated for several decades. This approach can achieve sufficient suppression of spermatogenesis for effective contraception in most men, but not all; the basis for these men responding insufficiently is unclear. Alternatively, the non-hormonal approach is based on identifying specific processes in sperm development, maturation and function. A range of targets has been identified in animal models, and targeted effectively. This approach, however, remains in the pre-clinical domain at present. There are, therefore, grounds for considering that safe, effective and reversible methods of contraception for men can be developed.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It is currently unclear which of these pose a significant threat to aquatic biota. The typical exposure scenario is now represented by a widespread blanket of contamination composed of myriads of individual pollutants-each typically present at a low concentration. The synthetic steroids, 17α-ethinylestradiol and , have been widely reported to be present in the aquatic environment in the low ng to sub-ng/l range. They are widely used in contraceptive formulations, both individually and in combination. Our research employed the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 21 day 'pair-breeding' assay to assess reproductive output when pairs of fish were exposed to the single chemicals at low environmentally relevant concentrations, and then to a binary mixture of them. A variety of endpoints were assessed, including egg production, which was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by both the individual chemicals and the mixture. Significant, sex specific effects were also seen with both chemicals, at differing levels of biological organisation. Plasma concentrations of EE2 and  were predicted and in the case of  measured, and compared with the human therapeutic plasma concentrations (Read-Across approach) to support the interpretation of the results. A novel quantitative method was developed for the data analysis, which ensured a suitable endpoint for the comparative mixture assessment. This approach compares the reproductive performance from individual pairs of fish during chemical exposure to its pre-treatment performance. The responses from the empirical mixture study were compared to predictions derived from the single substance data. We hypothesised combined responses which were best described by the concept of concentration addition, and found no clear indications against this additivity expectation. However, the effect profiles support the current knowledge that both compounds act in different ways to reduce egg production in fish, and suggest that probably response addition (also called Independent action) is the more appropriate mixture model in this case.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

The primary outcome was mean change in  or  composition.Two authors extracted the data. We computed the mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous variables and odds ratio with 95% CI for dichotomous variables.We did not conduct meta-analysis due to the various contraceptive methods and  change . Fifteen studies examined progestin-only pills (N=1), Norplant (N=4), and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) (N=10). Comparison groups were similar for  change in 11 studies. Four studies showed differences in  or  composition change for POCs compared to no hormonal method. Adolescents using DMPA had a greater increase in  fat (%) versus a group using no hormonal method (mean difference 11.00; 95% CI 2.64 to 19.36). The DMPA group also had a greater decrease in lean  mass (%) (mean difference -4.00; 95% CI -6.93 to -1.07). In another study,  gain (kg) was greater for the DMPA group than an IUD group (mean difference 2.28, 2.71, 3.17, respectively). The differences were notable within the normal  and overweight subgroups. One study showed the Norplant (six-capsule) group had greater  gain (kg) than a non-hormonal IUD group (mean difference 0.47 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.65) and a group using non-hormonal or no method (mean difference 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96). Another study also showed a Norplant group also had greater  gain (kg) than an IUD group (mean difference 1.10; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84).We found little evidence of  gain when using POCs. Mean gain was less than 2 kg for most studies up to 12 months, and usually similar for the comparison group using another contraceptive.

Since this association was originally suggested, the steroid dose in oral contraceptives has been significantly reduced and new progestogens have been developed. Also, triphasic formulations have been introduced which offer a well-balanced estrogen/progestogen ratio, allowing a further reduction in the progestogen dose per cycle, and thus helping to minimize unwanted metabolic and hemostatic effects. The metabolic interactions of triphasic , the first triphasic formulation to be introduced, have received particular attention.  appears to be largely unaffected by triphasic , most studies reporting no significant change in high- (HDL-C) or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Several studies have reported a decrease in the lipoprotein subfraction HDL2-C levels, but in most cases measurements of the LDL-C/HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1/B ratios reveal no clinically significant effects. Concerning lipids, most studies suggest that triphasic  has less metabolic impact than the monophasic formulation. In common with all currently available oral contraceptives, triphasic  appears to have some effect on carbohydrate . The study results vary, however; some investigators have found an impairment of glucose tolerance, whereas others have not detected any significant effect. Compared with  and carbohydrate , fewer studies have investigated the effect of triphasic  on hemostasis. In common with all estrogen-containing oral contraceptives,  appears to stimulate some procoagulant activity, elevating the levels of factors VII and X, and fibrinogen. However, the effect of triphasic  appears to be balanced, with most studies reporting a corresponding increase in anti-coagulant-fibrinolytic activity. Although most of the studies reviewed here reported some statistically significant metabolic interactions, many authors comment that the changes are probably not clinically relevant in terms of an altered risk of cardiovascular disease. The true risk of vascular disease associated with modern low-dose oral contraceptives remains to be confirmed when sufficient epidemiological data eventually become available.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12065173>Efficacy and safety of oral and transdermal hormonal replacement treatment containing .</a></h2><p>The oral combined formulation of  with estradiol valerate (LNG+EV) has demonstrated to be effective on some postmenopausal symptoms.

A wide variety of contraceptives are available for these women. However, hormonal contraceptives might influence carbohydrate and lipid  and increase micro- and macrovascular complications, so caution in selecting a contraceptive method is required.To investigate whether progestogen-only, combined estrogen and progestogen or non-hormonal contraceptives differ in terms of effectiveness in preventing pregnancy, in their side effects on carbohydrate and lipid , and in long-term complications such as micro- and macrovascular disease when used in women with diabetes mellitus.The search was performed in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, CINAHL, WorldCat, ECO, ArticleFirst, the Science Citation Index, the British Library Inside, and reference lists of relevant articles. The last search was performed in January 2013. In addition, experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies marketing contraceptives were contacted to identify published, unpublished or ongoing studies.Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that studied women with diabetes mellitus comparing: 1. hormonal versus non-hormonal contraceptives; 2. progestogen-only versus estrogen and progestogen contraceptives; 3. contraceptives containing < 50 µg estrogen versus contraceptives containing ≥ 50 µg estrogen; and 4. contraceptives containing first-, second- and third-generation progestogens, drospirenone and cyproterone acetate. The principal outcomes were contraceptive effectiveness, diabetes control, lipid  and micro- and macrovascular complications.Two investigators evaluated the titles and abstracts identified from the literature search. Quality assessment was performed independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion or consulting a third review author. Because the trials differed in studied contraceptives, participant characteristics and methodological quality, we could not combine the data in a meta-analysis. The trials were therefore examined on an individual basis and narrative summaries were provided.Four randomised controlled trials were included. No unintended pregnancies were reported during the study periods. Only one trial was of good methodological quality. It compared the influence of a -releasing intrauterine device (IUD) versus a copper IUD on carbohydrate  in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus. No significant difference was found between the two groups. The other three trials were of limited methodological quality. Two compared progestogen-only pills with different estrogen and progestogen combinations, and one also included the -releasing IUD and copper IUD. The trials reported that blood glucose levels remained stable during treatment with most regimens. Only high-dose combined oral contraceptives and 30 µg ethinylestradiol + 75 µg gestodene were identified as slightly impairing glucose homeostasis. The three studies found conflicting results regarding lipid . Some combined oral contraceptives appeared to have a minor adverse effect while others appeared to slightly improve lipid . The copper IUD and progestogen-only oral contraceptives also slightly improved lipid  and no influence was seen while using the levonorgestel-releasing IUD. Only one study reported on micro- and macrovascular complications. It observed no signs or symptoms of thromboembolic incidents or visual disturbances, however study duration was short. Only minor adverse effects were reported in two studies.The four included randomised controlled trials in this systematic review provided insufficient evidence to assess whether progestogen-only and combined contraceptives differ from non-hormonal contraceptives in diabetes control, lipid  and complications. Three of the four studies were of limited methodological quality, sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and described surrogate outcomes. Ideally, an adequately reported, high-quality randomised controlled trial analysing both intermediate outcomes (that is glucose and lipid ) and true clinical endpoints (micro- and macrovascular disease) in users of combined, progestogen-only and non-hormonal contraceptives should be conducted. However, due to the low incidence of micro- and macrovascular disease and accordingly the large sample size and long follow-up period needed to observe differences in risk, a randomised controlled trial might not be the ideal design.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12502684>Effects of injectable or implantable progestin-only contraceptives on -glucose metabolism and diabetes risk.</a></h2><p>Progestin-only contraceptives administered by injection (Depo-Provera) or subcutaneous implant (Norplant) have been available to U.S. women for about a decade. Two epidemiological studies found their use associated with increased incidence of type 2 diabetes. In reviewing publications relating progestin injections and implants to glucose metabolism, 25 studies of various study designs and laboratory methods were identified that reported at least one  value in nondiabetic women. Research subjects were usually nonobese and often from developing countries. Of eight studies that performed sequential oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) after at least 6 months of Depo-Provera or Norplant use, seven found significant elevations (approximate doubling) of  at 2 or 3 h after glucose challenge; the effects on fasting, half-hour, or 1-h postchallenge  values were less consistent. The three studies that performed sequential intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs) on injection users all found an increased early-phase  response. One study used sequential hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps to demonstrate reduced total-body glucose uptake per unit of  after 8 weeks of Norplant use. The metabolic studies generally did not show a reduction in the glucose tolerance of their nondiabetic subjects. However, compared with the lean and low-risk women who were usually selected for metabolic research, many U.S. women receiving these injections or implants may start out with increased  due to greater weight, sedentary lifestyle, and family or childbearing histories.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral contraceptives (OCs) on endothelial function measured as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, the lipid profile, and blood markers of endothelial activation (inflammation) in amenorrheic athletes. Age- and  mass index-matched groups of young endurance athletes with amenorrhea (n = 11), regularly cycling athletes (n = 13), and sedentary controls (n = 12) were examined before and after 9 months of treatment with a low dose, monophasic, combined OC (30 mug ethinyl estradiol and 150 mug ). The amenorrheic athletes displayed the lowest FMD at baseline and the largest increase after OC treatment. FMD also increased in the control group, but not in the regularly menstruating athletes, who had the highest values of FMD before treatment. All three groups, particularly the controls, showed moderate unfavorable changes in the lipid profile in accordance with previous known effects of a second generation OC. Furthermore, there was an overall increase in some inflammatory markers (high sensitive C-reactive protein and TNF-alpha) and a decrease in one of the markers (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1). We conclude that amenorrheic athletes benefit from treatment with OC with respect to endothelial function. OC treatment is also associated with some modest alterations in the lipid profile and in markers of inflammation.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26409014>A 3-year multicentre randomized controlled trial of etonogestrel- and -releasing contraceptive implants, with non-randomized matched copper-intrauterine device controls.</a></h2><p>Is there any difference in the clinical performance of the 3-year one-rod etonogestrel (ENG)- and the 5-year two-rod  (LNG)-releasing contraceptive implants during 3 years of insertion, and between implant and intrauterine device (IUD) contraception, in particular complaints possibly related to hormonal contraceptives?The cumulative contraceptive effectiveness after 3 years and method continuation through 2.5 years were not significantly different between ENG and LNG implants, but both outcomes were significantly worse in the non-randomized age-matched group of IUD users than in the combined implant group.ENG- and LNG-releasing implants are safe and highly efficacious contraceptives with pregnancy rates reported to be 0.0-0.5 per 100 women-years (W-Y).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of subcutaneous etonogestrel implantation on adenomyosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS A clinical observational study included 17 women with adenomyosis who were treated with subcutaneous etonogestrel implants and followed-up for 12 months. Imaging and clinical observations were undertaken in the 17 patients at baseline (time 0), and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months following subcutaneous etonogestrel implantation. The following imaging and clinical findings were compared between baseline (time 0) and 12-month follow-up: menstrual bleeding pattern, dysmenorrhea, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, uterine volume, serum cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels, hemoglobin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, luteinizing hormone levels, serum estradiol levels, and any treatment side effects. RESULTS All 17 patients treated with etonogestrel implants completed the 12-month follow-up, at which time, the mean hemoglobin level (127.08±2.56 g/L) was significantly higher compared with that at baseline (94.54±5.47 g/L; P<0.01); uterine volume, serum CA125, and VAS score for dysmenorrhea at 12 months (118.03±12.83 cm³, 34.58±9.66 U/mL, and 1.45±0.35, respectively) were significantly lower when compared with baseline (198.53±39.47 cm³, 100.41±49.89 U/mL, and 7.62±0.74, respectively) (P<0.01, for all).

The 21-carbon series (pregnane nucleus) includes the corticoids and the true progestins (e.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate). The 19-carbon series (androstane nucleus) includes all the androgens, among them the progestins used in most oral and parenteral contraceptives. The removal of carbon 19 from testosterone changes the major hormonal effect from androgenic to progestogenic, but these "19-nor" steroids retain varying degrees of androgenic activity. (They can also have limited estrogenic activity, but this is insignificant at the low doses used for contraception.) Some of the 19-nortestosterone progestins are metabolized to other compounds (e.g., norethynodrel, ethynodiol diacetate, and lynestrenol to norethindrone), and some (, desogestrel) are active unchanged. The lingering androgenic effects of 19-nor progestins are dose-related, opposed by estrogen, and are manifested metabolically (e.g., glucose tolerance, lipoprotein synthesis) and symptomatically (e.g., acne, weight gain). The effect of 19-nortestosterones on lipoproteins prompted the development of less androgenic compounds, but the obvious benefit of the new progestins (desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate) is a reduction in the symptoms associated with the androgenicity of the older compounds. Mitigation of androgenic effects on lipoprotein and carbohydrate  could have long-term benefits, especially for women who are at risk of arteriosclerotic vascular disease; however, these effects remain to be epidemiologically demonstrated.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27245768>Several synthetic progestins disrupt the glial cell specific-brain aromatase expression in developing zebra fish.</a></h2><p>The effects of some progestins on fish reproduction have been recently reported revealing the hazard of this class of steroidal pharmaceuticals.

Progesterone and 24 progestins were first screened on transgenic cyp19a1b-GFP zebrafish embryos. We showed that progesterone, dydrogesterone, drospirenone and all the progesterone-derived progestins had no effect on GFP expression. Conversely, all progestins derived from 19-nortesterone induced GFP in a concentration-dependent manner with EC50 ranging from the low nM range to hundreds nM. The 19-nortestosterone derived progestins  (LNG) and norethindrone (NET) were further tested in a radial glial cell context using U251-MG cells co-transfected with zebrafish ER subtypes (zfERα, zfERβ1 or zfERβ2) and cyp19a1b promoter linked to luciferase. Progesterone had no effect on luciferase activity while NET and LNG induced luciferase activity that was blocked by ICI 182,780. Zebrafish-ERs competition assays showed that NET and LNG were unable to bind to ERs, suggesting that the effects of these compounds on cyp19a1b require  activation prior to elicit estrogenic activity. Overall, we demonstrate that 19-nortestosterone derived progestins elicit estrogenic activity by inducing cyp19a1b expression in radial glial cells. Given the crucial role of radial glial cells and neuro-estrogens in early development of brain, the consequences of exposure of fish to these compounds require further investigation.Copyright © 2016.

These studies evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetic interactions between elbasvir (EBR) and grazoprevir (GZR) and ethinyl estradiol/ (EE/LNG).Both studies were open-label, single-site, two-period, fixed-sequence, one-way interaction studies. In period 1, subjects received one tablet of EE/LNG (0.03 mg/0.15 mg). In period 2, subjects received EBR (50 mg once daily) for 13 days or GZR (200 mg once daily) for 10 days, with one tablet of EE/LNG on day 7 (GZR group) or 10 (EBR group). Each study enrolled 20 healthy, nonsmoking adult females.There was no clinically meaningful effect of multiple doses of EBR or GZR on the pharmacokinetics of EE or LNG. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for AUC and C in the presence and absence of EBR were 1.01 and 1.10 for EE and 1.14 and 1.02 for LNG, with 90% confidence intervals (CIs) that were contained in the interval [0.80, 1.25]. Similarly, the AUC and C GMRs in the presence and absence of GZR were 1.10 and 1.05 for EE and 1.23 and 0.93 for LNG, respectively. The 90% CIs for EE AUC and for EE and LNG C were contained in the interval [0.80, 1.25]; however, the 90% CI for the LNG AUC [1.15, 1.32] slightly exceeded the upper bound.These results suggest that EBR/GZR can be co-administered to female patients with HCV of childbearing potential who are on OCPs to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773233>Contraception and hormonal management in the perimenopause.</a></h2><p>This literature review focuses on contraception in perimenopausal women. As women age, their fecundity decreases but does not disappear until menopause. After age 40, 75% of pregnancies are unplanned and may result in profound physical and emotional impact. Clinical evaluation must be relied on to diagnose menopause, since hormonal levels fluctuate widely. Until menopause is confirmed, some potential for pregnancy remains; at age 45, women's sterility rate is 55%. Older gravidas experience higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and death. Many safe and effective contraceptive options are available to perimenopausal women. In addition to preventing an unplanned and higher-risk pregnancy, perimenopausal contraception may improve abnormal uterine bleeding, hot flashes, and menstrual migraines. Long-acting reversible contraceptives, including the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), the etonogestrel subdermal implant (ESI), and the copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD), provide high efficacy without estrogen. LNG-IUS markedly decreases menorrhagia commonly seen in perimenopause. Both ESI and LNG-IUS provide endometrial protection for women using estrogen for vasomotor symptoms. Women without cardiovascular risk factors can safely use combined hormonal contraception. The CDC's Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use informs choices for women with comorbidities. No medical contraindications exist for  emergency-contraceptive pills, though  does decrease efficacy. In contrast, the Cu-IUD provides reliable emergency and ongoing contraception regardless of body mass index (BMI).</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25634912>Progestin-Containing Contraceptives Alter Expression of Host Defense-Related Genes of the Endometrium and Cervix.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies indicate that progestin-containing contraceptives increase susceptibility to HIV, although the underlying mechanisms involving the upper female reproductive tract are undefined. To determine the effects of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on gene expression and physiology of human endometrial and cervical transformation zone (TZ), microarray analyses were performed on whole tissue biopsies. In endometrium, activated pathways included leukocyte chemotaxis, attachment, and inflammation in DMPA and LNG-IUS users, and individual genes included pattern recognition receptors, complement components, and other immune mediators. In cervical TZ, progestin treatment altered expression of tissue remodeling and viability but not immune function genes.

As novelties to the field, for the trimethylsilyl (TMS) oxime ether/ester derivatives of steroids and cholic acids, at first, a tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) type acquisition method has been developed in a single run; also for the first time, the three acquisition techniques, the full scan (FS), the selective ion monitoring (SIM), in our case the multiple ion monitoring (MIM) and the currently optimized MRM methods, have been compared; all three, in parallel, under strictly the same derivatization/instrumental conditions, both in matrix free solutions and municipal wastewater from two Hungarian wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Critical evaluation of the three acquisition protocols was collated on their analytical performances and validated under the same conditions. The data of six point calibration curves for FS, MIM and MRM methods, showed that both R² (0.9995, 0.9858, 0.9975) and RSD (5.3, 5.8, 5.0), for two parallel derivatizations, each injected three times, proved to be independent of the acquisition processes. Whereas, for the method limit of quantification (LOQ) and the instrument limit of quantification (ILQ) values showed considerable differences. LOQ data, were decreasing in the FS, MIM, MRM line (expressed in ng/L), for all steroids and cholic acids. The same trend was determined in terms of the ILQ values. The practical utility of the optimized acquisition techniques was confirmed by the quantitation of the steroids and cholic acids contents of wastewater samples. Results confirmed the importance of the MRM acquisition method, even in comparison to the MIM one: with particular interest in selected cases: avoiding the extreme overestimation of the β-estradiol (156-1325%) and that of the ethinylestradiol (582-831%) concentrations in the wastewater samples.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We sought to determine whether DHEA + estrogen replacement (ERT) prevented bone loss in young adolescents with AN.We recruited females with AN (n = 70, ages 11-18 years) into a 12-month, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomized to oral micronized DHEA 50 mg + 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol/.1 mg  daily (n = 35) or placebo (n = 35). Outcomes included serial measures of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual- X-ray absorptiometry (total body, hip, spine) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT; tibia). Magnetic resonance imaging of T1-weighted images of the left knee determined physeal status (open/closed).Sixty-two subjects completed the trial. Physeal closure status was the strongest predictor of aBMD changes. Among girls with open physes, those who received DHEA + ERT showed a decline in BMD Z-scores compared with those receiving placebo, whereas there was no effect in those with at least one closed physis. Treatment did not affect any pQCT measures, regardless of physeal closure status.Combined DHEA + ERT did not significantly improve dual- X-ray absorptiometry or pQCT BMD measurements in young adolescent girls with AN, in contrast to an earlier trial showing benefit in older adolescents and young women. In girls with open physes, the mean change in the placebo arm was greater than that of the DHEA + ERT group. We conclude that DHEA + ERT is ineffective for preserving bone health in growing young adolescents with AN at the dose and route of administration described in this report.Copyright © 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

We defined 5P's - period, pill, prognosis, pregnancy, and postthrombotic syndrome - that should be discussed with young women with VTE. Menstrual blood loss (Period) can be aggravated by anticoagulant therapy. This seems particularly true for direct oral anticoagulants. Abnormal uterine bleeding can be managed by hormonal therapy, tranexamic acid, or modification of treatment. The use of combined oral contraceptives (Pill) is a risk factor for VTE. The magnitude of the risk depends on progestagen types and estrogen doses used. In women using therapeutic anticoagulation, concomitant hormonal therapy does not increase the risk of recurrent VTE. -releasing intrauterine devices and low-dose progestin-only pills do not increase the risk of VTE. In young women VTE is often provoked by transient hormonal risk factors that affects prognosis. Sex is incorporated as predictor in recurrent VTE risk assessment models. However, current guidelines do not propose using these to guide treatment duration. Pregnancy increases the risk of VTE by 4-fold to 5-fold. Thrombophilia and obstetric risk factors further increase the risk of pregnancy-related VTE. In women with a history of VTE, the risk of recurrence during pregnancy or post partum appears to be influenced by risk factors present during the first VTE. In most women with a history of VTE, antepartum and postpartum thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular- heparin is indicated. Women generally are affected by VTE at a younger age then men, and they have to deal with long-term complications (Post-thrombotic syndrome) of deep vein thrombosis early in life.© 2019 The Authors.

We compared estimated in vivo  (LNG) release rates derived from Sino-implant (II) explants with similar data from removed Jadelle.We measured LNG remaining in 44 sets of Sino-implant (II) used for up to 7 years and removed in four Chinese clinics. Results were compared with published data for Jadelle explants used for up to 36 months. We estimated and compared monthly and daily LNG release rates for the two products using prediction models for drug release. We also estimated the dissolution profile similarity factor, f2, for LNG release.Both Sino-implant (II) and Jadelle release approximately 30% of total LNG load after 3 years. Results of fitting the data to a biologically plausible modified Higuchi prediction model indicate comparable release through 3 years. An estimated similarity factor of 80.6 (90% confidence interval: 70.8-85.7) indicates similarity in the dissolution profiles of the two implants.LNG release in vivo measured through explant analysis suggest that Sino-implant (II) and Jadelle may perform similarly through 3 years of use and could remain highly effective beyond this time point. These results align with published data for Jadelle and Sino-implant (II) showing high effectiveness for 5 years. Ongoing clinical studies comparing the products over 5 years present an opportunity to verify this supportive measure of clinical effectiveness.This innovative approach provides evidence that Sino-implant (II) may perform clinically similarly to Jadelle over 3 years and remain a highly effective contraceptive beyond this time point.

In our earlier xenograft animal experiments, progesterone did not stimulate breast tumors. The aim of this study was to test dydrogesterone for the first time. The study also evaluated the effects of PGRMC1 on proliferation with progestogens. METHODS (1): In-vitro study. The proliferative effects of dydrogesterone and of progesterone were assessed in vitro using T47D cells transfected with PGRMC1 or empty vector in the presence or absence of estradiol. Additionally, to find the strongest proliferator for inclusion as a comparator in the xenograft animal study, norethisterone, , desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, nomegestrol, and cyproterone acetate were tested. METHODS (2): Xenograft main study. PGRMC1-transfected or empty-vector T47D and MCF7 xenotransplants were each treated with four different hormonal preparations: E2+placebo; E2+dydrogesterone; E2+progesterone; E2+norethisterone. A total of 112 castrated mice were randomly allocated to the 16 groups. This was thus a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled four-arm study (45-50 days) with the two T47D and two MCF7 xenografts. Tumor volumes were monitored twice weekly. RESULTS (1): In-vitro study. The strongest proliferation was with norethisterone, but only with PGRMC1-transfected cells. There was significant proliferation with dydrogesterone, but not with progesterone in the absence of estradiol. However, no increase in proliferation was achieved by adding dydrogesterone to estradiol compared with the proliferation induced with estradiol alone, in contrast to norethisterone. RESULTS (2): Xenograft main study. There was significantly faster tumor growth with norethisterone + E2 than with E2+placebo in T47D and MCF7 PGRMC1 xenografts, but not with dydrogesterone + E2 or progesterone + E2. There was less tumor growth in empty-vector xenografts, without between-group differences.PGRMC1 increases the breast-cell proliferation effects of certain progestogens, including dydrogesterone, in contrast to progesterone, but not during estradiol-induced proliferation, either in vitro or in a xenograft animal model, in contrast to norethisterone. Thus the proliferative potency of dydrogesterone may be similar to that of progesterone. Clinical studies in women overexpressing PGRMC1 are recommended.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, all approved members of the class require administration by injection. Areas covered: This manuscript reviews oral semaglutide-an experimental GLP-1 receptor agonist in phase-3 clinical development. Available pharmacological and clinical data of the drug are reviewed, and important end-points described. Expert opinion: Oral peptide delivery has become possible with the discovery of absorption enhancers. The clinical development program of once-daily oral semaglutide has shown superiority in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin and  in comparison with placebo and active comparators (sitagliptin, liraglutide, and empagliflozin). Safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide is in line with injectable members of the class. Delayed gastric emptying, local increase in pH, and enhanced absorption do not seem to affect the exposure of a number of other oral drugs that have been tested (metformin, digoxin, oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol/, lisinopril, warfarin, furosemide and rosuvastatin). Clinical questions for further investigation include the effectiveness and safety of oral semaglutide in cardiovascular indications.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21943687>Combined estrogen-progestogen but not progestogen-only oral contraceptive alters glucose tolerance and plasma lipid profile in female rats.</a></h2><p>Women are exposed to sex steroids in several formulations such as oral contraceptives (OCs) and hormone replacement therapies. Estrogen is believed to have cardiometabolic protection effect; but its beneficial effects have recently been queried. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether or not the altered glucose tolerance and plasma lipid profile was associated with OC and due to the estrogenic or progestogenic-component and if that was dose-dependent in 7-8 weeks old female rats. Rats were divided into vehicle-treated (control), high dose combined OC-treated (HCOC; receiving 1.5μg ethinyl estradiol/15.0μg norgestrel), low dose combined OC-treated (LCOC; receiving 0.15μg ethinyl estradiol/1.5μg norgestrel), high dose progestogen OC-treated (HOC; receiving 35.0μg ) and low dose progestogen OC-treated (LOC; receiving 3.5μg ) groups. Rats were given (p.o.) vehicle (distilled water), HCOC, LCOC, HOC and LOC daily for 6 weeks. When compared with the controls, HCOC treatment led to significant decreases in glucose tolerance and plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. However, HCOC-treated and LCOC-treated groups had significantly higher plasma triglyceride levels when compared with the control group. Fasting blood glucose, plasma total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were comparable among groups.  gain appeared to be attenuated by OC treatments, particularly in LOC-treated rats. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that combined estrogen-progestogen but not progestogen-only OC use resulted in impaired glucose tolerance that was associated with increased triglyceride and decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. The effects on glucose tolerance and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were dose-dependent while that on triglyceride was not.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

High-dosage parenteral testosterone (T) esters alone or in combination with a progestogen (eg, depot medroxyprogesterone) have been shown to confer effective and reversible male contraception in clinical trials, but these regimens are associated with  gain and suppression of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels. We have previously demonstrated that intramuscular T enanthate 100 mg weekly plus oral  (LNG) 125, 250, or 500 microg daily suppresses spermatogenesis to levels associated with effective contraception, but there is a LNG-dosage-dependent effect of  gain and HDL suppression. We hypothesized that intramuscular T enanthate 100 mg weekly plus a very low dosage of oral LNG would effectively suppress spermatogenesis in normal men without inducing  gain or HDL suppression. We conducted a randomized trial comparing 6 months of intramuscular T enanthate (100 mg weekly) plus 31.25 microg of oral LNG daily (T+LNG 31; n = 20) or 62.5 microg of oral LNG daily (T+LNG 62; n = 21). The 2 regimens were equally effective in suppressing spermatogenesis to azoospermia, fewer than 1 million sperm/mL and fewer than 3 million sperm/mL (T+LNG 31 [60%, 85%, and 90%] vs T+LNG 62 [62%, 91%, and 95%] for azoospermia, fewer than 1 million and fewer than 3 million, respectively; P = NS). The T+LNG 31 group did not gain  (0.25 +/- 1.08 kg; P = NS compared with baseline), but the T+LNG 62 group gained 2.5 +/- 0.77 kg (P < .05 compared with baseline). Serum HDL cholesterol levels declined significantly in both groups (percentage decline month 6 of treatment vs baseline: 12.0% +/- 2.6% and 15.1% +/- 3.0%; P < .05 for T+LNG 31 and 62 respectively). Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels also declined in both groups (percentage decline month 6 of treatment vs baseline: 6.9 +/- 3.9 and 6.0% +/- 4.1%; P < .05 for T+LNG 31 and P = NS for T+LNG 62). There were no clinically significant adverse events or significant changes in hematology or chemistry profiles in either group during the study. We conclude that 1) intramuscular T plus oral LNG has a very potent synergistic effect in suppressing spermatogenesis at LNG dosages equal to or lower than dosages used in common female oral contraceptive regimens and 2) large, long-term contraceptive efficacy trials should be conducted with a variety of androgen-progestogen combinations including long-acting T formulations such as depot T pellets or intramuscular T undecanoate plus depot LNG or very low dosage oral LNG.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26161412> Inhibits Human Endometrial Cell Proliferation through the Upregulation of Gap Junctional Intercellular Communication via the Nuclear Translocation of Ser255 Phosphorylated Cx43.</a></h2><p>To assess whether LNG exerts antiproliferation effects on human endometrial cells through changes of GJIC function and the phosphorylated Cx43.Cell proliferation and apoptosis of human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) and glandular cells (HEGCs) treated with LNG in a dose- and time-dependent manner. GJIC change and further total Cx43 and serine 368 and 255 phosphorylated Cx43 were measured.5 × 10(-5) mol/L LNG revealed a time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation and an increase of apoptosis in both HESCs and HEGCs.

This abnormal uterine bleeding generally can be divided into anovulatory and ovulatory patterns. Chronic anovulation can lead to irregular bleeding, prolonged unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium, and increased risk of endometrial cancer. Causes include polycystic ovary syndrome, uncontrolled , thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, and use of antipsychotics or antiepileptics. Women 35 years or older with recurrent anovulation, women younger than 35 years with risk factors for endometrial cancer, and women with excessive bleeding unresponsive to medical therapy should undergo endometrial biopsy. Treatment with combination oral contraceptives or progestins may regulate menstrual cycles. Histologic findings of hyperplasia without atypia may be treated with cyclic or continuous progestin. Women who have hyperplasia with atypia or adenocarcinoma should be referred to a gynecologist or gynecologic oncologist, respectively. Ovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding, or menorrhagia, may be caused by thyroid dysfunction, coagulation defects (most commonly von Willebrand disease), endometrial polyps, and submucosal fibroids. Transvaginal ultrasonography or saline infusion sonohysterography may be used to evaluate menorrhagia. The -releasing intrauterine system is an effective treatment for menorrhagia. Oral progesterone for 21 days per month and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also effective. Tranexamic acid is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovulatory bleeding, but is expensive. When clear structural causes are identified or medical management is ineffective, polypectomy, fibroidectomy, uterine artery embolization, and endometrial ablation may be considered.

The risk of VTE due to COCs containing newer-generation progestins is double compared with COCs containing older-generation progestins, although there is little difference in estrogen contents between the generations. In contrast, progestin-only contraceptives do not confer an increased risk of VTE. In this study, we aimed to investigate how different isoforms of progestin in COCs affect the risk of VTE by measuring PS expression.The effect of progestin,  (LNG) or drospirenone (DRSP), on PS mRNA expression in HepG2 cells was measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; PS level was determined using Western blot analysis. PROS1 promoter activity, PS mRNA stability, and de novo synthesis of PS mRNA were examined in HepG2 cells after treatment with progestin.In the presence of progestins, PS mRNA and protein expressions were significantly upregulated in HepG2 cells due to the augmentation of de novo PS mRNA expression modulated by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), thereby facilitating PS transcription elongation. Moreover, the transcription elongation inhibitor blocked progestin-mediated de novo PS mRNA expression. Conversely, progestin did not affect PROS1 promoter activity and PS mRNA stability. Pol II elongation efficiency in the newer-generation progestin (DRSP) treatment was not as strong compared with older-generation progestin (LNG), suggesting the difference in VTE risk between COC generations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we have tried to assess some of the metabolic effects of three hormonal contraceptives commonly used by young females.Three hundred young, healthy, nonsmoking and normotensive women of childbearing age who were seeking contraceptive advice were randomly allocated to one of the three groups receiving ethinyl estradiol and norgestrel (group 1), medroxyprogesterone acetate (group 2), and  capsules (group 3). Levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), were measured prior to the initiation of therapy and after termination of the study (6 months).There was no significant difference between the three groups as far as the mean age, height and  were concerned. FBG increased in all three groups, but the difference in the rate of increase was not statistically significant (P=0.29). Total cholesterol, TG and LDL-C increased, while HDL-C level decreased in groups 1 and 2. These changes were, however, more profound in the group 2 cases. In those receiving , all lipid parameters decreased. The amount of change for the total cholesterol and triglyceride was quite significant (P<0.001), while the reduction in HDL-C was not significantly different from the other two groups by pairwise comparisons (Tukey-HSD procedure). The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was found to be significantly increased in groups 1 and 2, but it remained almost unchanged in the group 3 cases (P<0.001).Because of these favorable biochemical findings, we believe that  should be the contraceptive drug of choice for women of childbearing age who are seeking a safe method of contraception.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24890474>A simple, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of dienogest in human plasma and its pharmacokinetic applications under fasting.</a></h2><p>A simple, rapid and sensitive analytical method using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detection with positive ion electrospray ionization was developed for the determination of dienogest in human K2 EDTA plasma using  d6 as an internal standard (IS).

Progestogen contaminations act as potent steroids with mixed progestagenic, androgenic and mild estrogenic effects that is why our aim was to investigate the morphological and molecular effects of mixture of progesterone, drospirenone, and  in environmentally relevant (10ng/L) and higher (50 and 500ng/L) exposure concentrations in common roach, Rutilus rutilus. Steroids (e.g. progestogens) and the protein deglycase DJ-1 chaperon molecule aim the same target molecules in cells, therefore, we hypothesized that a relationship may exist between progestogens and DJ-1. Furthermore, our other aim was to follow the changes of signal molecules of different biological function due to progestogen treatment in serum and brain. Adult roaches were exposed to 10, 50 and 500ng/L of mixture of progestogen for 42 days and their somatic indices (brain-somatic, liver-somatic, gonadosomatic and kidney-somatic) were measured. Vitellogenin (VTG) expression (estrogen effect) or inhibition (androgen effect) in fish is a widely used biomarker so we measured its changes in liver by ELISA. To determine the quantity and to map the spatial distribution of DJ-1 chaperon protein the brain and liver tissues were analyzed by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we also studied molecular alterations: a) in the serum by measuring cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglyceride concentrations and b) in brain homogenate using a cell stress array kit (26 protein). The somatic index of liver and kidney significantly in all the treated groups, whereas the gonadosomatic index of 500ng/L treated group showed significant decrease compared to control animals. VTG level increased significantly in 500ng/L progestogen treated group. Since the concentration of DJ-1 significantly increased in brain and liver in all progestogen treatment groups, the DJ-1 protein could be able to a more sensitive marker than VTG. Serum LDL and cholesterol levels of exposed fish were significantly decreased. DJ-1 was mediated through the stimulation of the expression of LDL-receptor which facilitates reuptake subsequently. In summary, our observations unfolded new data about molecular alterations induced by the combined action of environmental progestogens. In addition, the DJ-1 chaperon protein as a possible biomarker helped to trace the abiotic chemical environmental contaminations, like progestogens in the freshwater ecosystems.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, most of the toxicity studies so far focused on effects of single contaminants. The available information on the potential toxicity of combined hormones on microalgae is extremely limited. For these reasons the aim of this study was to evaluate the individual and mixture effect of estrone (E1), ß-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17-α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), progesterone (PRO), 5-pregnen-3β-ol-20-one (PRE),  (LG) and testosterone (TST) on Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus armatus. Green algae cells were exposed to different concentrations (0.1-100 mg L) of hormones for 14 days. Biomass in the form of dry  and chlorophyll a was examined. The decreasing order of toxicity (based on EC, 14d) to Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus armatus was: EE2>PRO > E2>PRE > TST > E3>LG > E1 and EE2>PRO > TST > E2>PRE > LG > E1>E3, respectively. Chlorella vulgaris was more sensitive to the effects of hormones than Scenedesmus armatus. Although mixed hormones were more toxic to green algae than single hormones, in the ecosystem mixtures can pose higher ecological risk than single pollutants. Therefore, data on the toxicology of both single and mixed hormones is very valuable for assessment of the possibility of adverse ecological effects caused by these pollutants. Furthermore, these results suggest that environmental exposure to hormone mixtures may cause toxicity levels different to the sum of those of the single hormones and provides a basic understanding of their toxic effect on algae.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Factor VIII increased 27% by OC2 (p<.001) but declined to a 9% increase by OC21. Protein C increased only 6%. EE2 steady-state area-under-the-curve ranged from 488 to 1103pg∙h/mL; higher levels were not correlated with greater increases in clotting variables. CBG and SHBG increased significantly but were not significantly correlated with levels of EE2 or with the hemostatic variables.D-dimer increases during the first OC cycle were at least as great as increases seen with longer OC use. These results provide support for the increased VTE risk during initial OC use. The extreme variability in D-dimer levels may be an important component of this risk.This study showed that increases in D-dimer are clearly evident in the first cycle of OC use and may be larger than are seen after a longer duration of use and thus provide biological support for the increased VTE risk during initial OC use found in epidemiological studies.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Clinical and preclinical studies have shown that low estradiol levels during extinction of fear conditioning in rodents (i.e., cue exposure therapy in humans) leads to poor extinction consolidation and increased fear during extinction recall. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is also associated with stress-related pathologies, and RAS antagonists can enhance extinction consolidation in males. However, less is known about how estradiol and the RAS converge to alter fear extinction consolidation in females. Since estradiol downregulates the RAS, we determined the role of surgically (via ovariectomy [OVX]) and pharmacologically (via the hormonal contraceptive [HC], ) clamping estradiol at low levels in female rats on fear-related behavior, serum estradiol and angiotensin II (Ang II) levels, and angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) binding in the brain. We then tested whether the AT1R antagonist losartan would alter fear-related behavior in an estradiol-dependent manner. We found that both OVX and HC treatment produced extinction consolidation deficits relative to intact female rats in proestrus (when estradiol levels are high), and that losartan treatment mitigated these deficits and reduced freezing. OVX, but not HC, altered AT1R ligand binding, though HC reduced estradiol and increased Ang II levels in plasma. These findings have significant clinical implications, indicating that administration of an AT1R antagonist, especially if estradiol levels are low, prior to an exposure therapy session may improve treatment outcomes in females.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26354259>Polycaprolactone thin-film drug delivery systems: Empirical and predictive models for device design.</a></h2><p>To define empirical models and parameters based on theoretical equations to describe drug release profiles from two polycaprolactone thin-film drug delivery systems. Additionally, to develop a predictive model for empirical parameters based on drugs' physicochemical properties.Release profiles from a selection of drugs representing the standard pharmaceutical space in both polycaprolactone matrix and reservoir systems were determined experimentally. The proposed models were used to calculate empirical parameters describing drug diffusion and release. Observed correlations between empirical parameters and drug properties were used to develop equations to predict parameters based on drug properties. Predictive and empirical models were evaluated in the design of three prototype devices: a  matrix system for on-demand locally administered contraception, a timolol-maleate reservoir system for glaucoma treatment, and a primaquine-bisphosphate reservoir system for malaria prophylaxis.Proposed empirical equations accurately fit experimental data. Experimentally derived empirical parameters show significant correlations with LogP, molecular , and solubility. Empirical models based on predicted parameters accurately predict experimental release data for three prototype systems, demonstrating the accuracy and utility of these models.The proposed empirical models can be used to design polycaprolactone thin-film devices for target geometries and release rates. Empirical parameters can be predicted based on drug properties. Together, these models provide tools for preliminary evaluation and design of controlled-release delivery systems.Copyright © 2015.

We assessed study quality using the United States Preventive Services Task Force evidence grading system.We identified four pooled secondary analyses (quality: poor to fair), two of which examined UPA and three examined LNG formulations. Three analyses pooled overlapping data from a total of three primary studies and demonstrated significant associations between obesity and risk of pregnancy after ECP use. One analysis reported a 4-fold increased risk of pregnancy among women with obesity (BMI≥30kg/m) compared with women within normal/underweight categories (BMI<25kg/m) after use of LNG ECPs [odds ratio (OR) 4.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-9.4]. Further analysis of the same LNG data found that, at an approximate  of 80 kg, the rate of pregnancy rose above 6%, which is the estimated pregnancy probability without contraception; at  less than 75 kg, the rate of pregnancy was less than 2%. Two analyses examining UPA suggested an approximate 2-fold increased risk of pregnancy among women with obesity compared with either normal/underweight women or nonobese (BMI<30kg/m) women (OR 2.6; 95% CI 0.9-7.0 and OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.0-4.3, respectively), but CIs were wide. Finally, the fourth secondary analysis pooled data from three separate randomized controlled trials on LNG ECPs and found no increase in pregnancy risk with increasing  or BMI and found no consistent association between pregnancy and both factors when adjusted for other covariates.While data are limited and poor to fair quality, findings suggest that women with obesity experience an increased risk of pregnancy after use of LNG ECP compared with those normal/underweight. Women with obesity may also experience an increased risk of pregnancy compared with women without obesity after use of UPA ECP, though differences did not reach statistical significance. Providers should counsel all women at risk for unintended pregnancy, including those with obesity, about the effectiveness of the full range of emergency contraception options in order for them to understand their options, to receive advanced supplies of emergency contraception as needed and to understand how to access an emergency copper intrauterine device if desired.Copyright © 2016.

The effects of obesity on incidence and survival were incorporated. The IUD was assumed to confer a 50% reduction in cancer incidence over 5 years. Costs of IUD and cancer care were included. Clinical outcomes were cancer diagnosis and deaths from cancer. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated in 2015 U.S. dollars per year of life saved. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo probabilistic analyses were performed.For a 50 year old with BMI 40 or greater, the IUD strategy is costlier and more effective than usual care with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $74,707 per year of life saved. If the protective effect of the  IUD is assumed to be 10 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreases to $37,858 per year of life saved.

The objective of this analysis was to identify factors associated with choice of highly effective, long-acting, progestin-only contraceptive methods after abortion.Women presenting for surgical abortion who selected the  intrauterine device (IUD), the progestin implant or the progestin injection (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or DMPA) as their postabortion contraceptives were recruited to participate in a 1-year prospective cohort study. We used multivariable multinomial logistic regression to identify factors associated with choosing long-acting reversible contraceptives (IUD or implant) compared to DMPA.A total of 260 women, aged 18-45 years, enrolled in the study, 100 of whom chose the IUD, 63 the implant and 97 the DMPA. The women were 24.9 years old on average; 36% were black, and 29% were Latina. Fifty-nine percent had had a previous abortion, 66% a prior birth, and 55% were undergoing a second-trimester abortion. In multivariable analyses, compared with DMPA users, women who chose the IUD or the implant were less likely to be currently experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV); reported higher stress levels; weighed more; and were more likely to have finished high school, to have used the pill before and to report that counselors or doctors were helpful in making the decision (all significant at p<.05, see text for relative risk ratios and confidence intervals.) In addition, women who chose the IUD were less likely to be black (p<.01), and women who chose the implant were more likely to report that they would be unhappy to become pregnant within 6 months (p<.05) than DMPA users.A variety of factors including race/ethnicity, past contraceptive use, feelings towards pregnancy, stress and  were different between LARC and DMPA users. Notably, current IPV was associated with choice of DMPA over the IUD or implant, implying that a desire to choose a hidden method may be important to some women and should be included in counseling.In contraceptive counseling, after screening for IPV, assessing patient's stress and taking a history about past contraceptive use, clinicians should discuss whether these factors might affect a patient's choice of method.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

There is wide variation in the contraceptive practices between continents, countries, and societies. The medical eligibility for contraception for sexually active women with epilepsy (WWE) is determined by the type of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that they use. Enzyme inducing AEDs such as phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine increase the  of orally administered estrogen (and progesterone to a lesser extent). Estrogen can increase the  of certain AEDs, such as lamotrigine, leading to cyclical variation in its blood level with resultant adverse effect profile or seizure dyscontrol. AEDs and sex hormones can increase the risk of osteoporosis and fracture in WWE. The potential interactions between AEDs and hormonal contraception need to be discussed with all women in reproductive age-group. The alternate options of oral contraception such as intrauterine copper device, intrauterine  release system, and supplementary protection with barriers need to be presented to them. World Health Organization has recommended to avoid combination contraceptive pills containing estrogen and progesteron in women who desire contraception and in breastfeeding mothers. Care providers need to consider the option of non-enzyme-inducing AEDs while initiating long-term treatment in adolescent and young WWE.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7901465>[Contraception.

Implanon is a single-rod implant system containing a low androgenic progestin and requires 1 to 2 minutes for insertion and removal. Like other implants, Implanon prevents pregnancy by changing the character of the cervical mucus and interfering with luteal function. Unlike Norplant, though, Implanon is designed to prevent ovulation for the full duration of use. Implant contraception has several advantages over other types of contraception including high efficacy, minimal required maintenance, absence of estrogen, and rapid return of fertility after discontinuation. Implants can be a good choice for adolescents; women with hypertension, , anemia, endometriosis, or other medical problems; and women who are breast-feeding. Irregular bleeding is the most common adverse effect of implants and can be treated with several medication regimens. Preinsertion counseling, however, is the most important factor in ensuring satisfaction with implants.

Overall, most studies of higher quality do not demonstrate a difference in oral contraceptive pill effectiveness in obese compared with non-obese women. However, data are scant for women in the highest categories of obesity, and differences by progestin type are incompletely understood. Effectiveness of most non-oral contraceptives does not seem to be compromised in obesity.

Administration of DG (150 micrograms/day; 14 women) or LN (150 micrograms/day; 12 women) for 2 weeks caused no changes in the excretion of these prostanoids, but LN administration decreased serum HDL cholesterol levels. After that, the women underwent a monophasic regimen of 150 micrograms DG or LN plus 30 micrograms EE for 3 months and thereafter polyphasic regimens of the same steroids for a further 3 months. The DG-containing pills increased urinary dinor excretion by 25-40%, but caused no changes in 6-keto and TxB2 excretion, as measured on days 19-21 of the cycles. LN-containing pills reduced urinary 6-keto excretion by 22% at the end of polyphasic treatment, but caused no changes in dinor and TxB2 output. DG plus EE, but not LN plus EE, increased serum total HDL and HDL2 cholesterol concentrations by a maximum of 25%. Thus, a DG plus EE combination may stimulate PGI2 synthesis by increasing the levels of HDL/HDL2.

The initial efficacy of E2V/DNG on ovulation inhibition was investigated in 2 prospective, randomized, open-label, Phase II dose-finding studies. The dose that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration resulted in 3.13% of women ovulating in the second cycle of treatment (90% CI, 0.2%-6.05%). Rate of pregnancy prevention with this agent was reported with a Pearl Index ranging from 0.73 to 1.27 (unadjusted) to 0.34 to 0.72 (adjusted for method failure only).

Whilst abnormal menstrual bleeding may be associated with underlying pathology, in the present context, HMB is defined as excessive menstrual bleeding in the absence of other systemic or gynaecological disease. The first-line therapy is usually medical, avoiding possibly unnecessary surgery. Of the wide variety of medications used to reduce HMB, oral progestogens were originally the most commonly prescribed agents. This review assesses the effectiveness of two different types and regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB.This is the update of a Cochrane review last updated in 2007, and originally named "Effectiveness of cyclical progestagen therapy in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding" (1998).To determine the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase (short cycle) or for a longer course of 21 days per cycle (long cycle), in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive age with HMB.In January 2019 we searched Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility's specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycInfo. We also searched trials registers, other sources of unpublished or grey literature and reference lists of retrieved trials. We also checked citation lists of review articles to identify trials.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatments for HMB that included cyclical oral progestogens were eligible.Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for clarification of methods or additional data when necessary. We only assessed adverse events if they were separately measured in the included trials. We compared cyclical oral progestogen in different regimens and placebo or other treatments. Our primary outcomes were menstrual blood loss and satisfaction with treatment; the secondary outcomes were number of days of bleeding, quality of life, compliance and acceptability of treatment, adverse events and costs.This review identified 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1071 women in total. Most of the women knew which treatment they were receiving, which may have influenced their judgements about menstrual blood loss and satisfaction. Other aspects of trial quality varied among trials.We did not identify any RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo. We assessed comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies separately according to different regimens.Short-cycle progestogen therapy during the luteal phase (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone for 7 to 10 days, from day 15 to 19) was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the progestogen-releasing intrauterine system (Pg-IUS (off of the market since 2001)), releasing 60 mcg of progesterone daily, with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (mean difference (MD) 37.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.67 to 56.91; I = 50%; 6 trials, 145 women). The rate of satisfaction and the quality of life with treatment was similar in both groups. The number of bleeding days was greater on the short cycle progestogen group compared to other medical treatments. Adverse events (such as gastrointestinal symptoms and  gain) were more likely with danazol when compared with progestogen treatment. We note that danazol is no longer in general use for treating HMB.Long-cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone), from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle, is also inferior to the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), releasing tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (MD 16.88, 95% CI 10.93 to 22.84; I = 87%; 4 trials, 355 women). A higher proportion of women taking norethisterone found their treatment unacceptable compared to women having Pg-IUS (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.40; 1 trial, 40 women). However, the adverse effects of breast tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding were more likely in women with the LNG-IUS. No trials reported on days of bleeding or quality of life for this comparison.The evidence supporting these findings was limited by low or very low gradings of quality; thus, we are uncertain about the findings and there is a potential that they may change if we identify other trials.Low- or very low-quality evidence suggests that short-course progestogen was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the Pg-IUS with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss. Long cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone) was also inferior to the LNG-IUS, tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1317759>Effects of oral contraceptives containing oestrogen combined with norethisterone or  on erythrocyte cation transport in normal women.</a></h2><p>1.

In a separate study of erythrocyte cation transport (excluding Na(+)-Na+ countertransport), in which women undertook treatment with norethisterone only (350 micrograms/day) for 6 months starting 6 weeks post partum, no changes in Na+,K+ co-transport were observed at 3 or 6 months; there were no changes in cation transport in a corresponding control group. 4. The results of these studies confirm that certain oral contraceptive compounds can alter erythrocyte cation transport, and indicate that norethisterone in higher dose preparations is the component predominantly responsible.

Accurate diagnosis is of key importance to realising effective treatment, reducing morbidity and, in the case of PMB, reducing mortality. There are many tests available, including transvaginal scan (TVS), endometrial biopsy (EBx), saline infusion sonography and outpatient hysteroscopy (OPH); however, optimal diagnostic work-up is unclear.To determine the most cost-effective diagnostic testing strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of (i) HMB and (ii) PMB.Parameter inputs were derived from systematic quantitative reviews, individual patient data (IPD) from existing data sets and focused searches for specific data. In the absence of data estimates, the consensus view of an expert clinical panel was obtained.Two clinically informed decision-analytic models were constructed to reflect current service provision for the diagnostic work-up of women presenting with HMB and PMB. The model-based economic evaluation took the form of a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the NHS in a contemporary, 'one-stop' secondary care clinical setting, where all indicated testing modalities would be available during a single visit.Two potentially cost-effective testing strategies for the initial investigation of women with HMB were identified: OPH alone or in combination with EBx. Although a combination testing strategy of OPH + EBx was marginally more effective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was approximately £21,000 to gain one more satisfied patient, whereas for OPH it was just £360 when compared with treatment with the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) without investigation. Initial testing with OPH was the most cost-effective testing approach for women wishing to preserve fertility and for women with symptoms refractory to empirical treatment with a LNG-IUS. For the investigation of PMB, selective use of TVS based on historical risk prediction for the diagnostic work-up of women presenting with PMB generated an ICER compared with our reference strategy of 'no initial work-up' of £129,000 per extra woman surviving 5 years. The ICERs for the two other non-dominated testing strategies, combining history and TVS or combining OPH and TVS, were over £2M each.In the absence of IPD, estimates of accuracy for test combinations presented some uncertainty where test results were modelled as being discordant.For initial investigation of women presenting to secondary care with HMB who do not require preservation of their fertility, our research suggests a choice between OPH alone or a combination of OPH and EBx. From our investigation, OPH appears to be the optimal first-line diagnostic test used for the investigation of women presenting to secondary care with HMB wishing to preserve their fertility or refractory to previous medical treatment with the LNG-IUS. We would suggest that the current recommendation of basing the initial investigation of women with PMB on the universal TVS measurement of endometrial thickness at a 5-mm threshold may need to be replaced by a strategy of restricting TVS to women with risk factors (e.g. increasing age-raised body mass index,  or nulliparity), obtained from the preceding clinical assessment.The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8828314>Use of Norplant in women with or at-risk for noninsulin-dependent .</a></h2><p>This review addresses the use of Norplant in women with or at-risk for noninsulin-dependent  (NIDDM).

Review.</a></h2><p>Considerable progress has been made in learning about the physiology and biochemistry of the sebaceous glands and several of the diseases that affect this component of the skin. Of these diseases, acne has particular importance. It is associated with adolescence, and because of the hormonal changes that take place in this stage, when it is severe it can cause depression. Moreover, in a considerable proportion of acne sufferers both adolescent and adult, it can produce tumors and deformation of the sebaceous glands. This seriously affects the sufferers to the point where it may limit their professional activities because they do not want to be seen in public. Several important issues from classic studies on the sebaceous gland will be reviewed in this document to report the state of the art of current treatments for the pathology of these glands. The sebaceous gland is an intracrine organ, capable of synthesizing and metabolizing different steroidal hormones. The role of each of the enzymes involved in these processes of the skin will be analyzed. The presence of different hormone receptors in the scientific literature will be also reviewed, due to the role of the sebaceous gland in lipogenesis at different ages. We also describe the mechanism of action of androgens and progestins in relation to coregulators recruited for lipogenesis in this gland. We propose several new steroidal compounds based on their mechanism of action to block lipogenesis in the sebaceous glands. These molecules offer potential for new treatment options for skin diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10337871>Comparison of the effects of triphasic oral contraceptives with desogestrel or  on apolipoprotein A-I-containing high-density lipoprotein particles.</a></h2><p>Recent observations suggest that the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with both the level and composition of the two major populations of apolipoprotein (apo)-defined high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles: those containing both apo A-I and apo A-II [Lp(AI,AII)] and those containing apo A-I without apo A-II [Lp(AI)]. While sex hormones are known to affect HDL, their influence on these apo-defined HDL particles is not known. We have determined the effects of two triphasic oral contraceptive (OC) formulations on these HDL particles in healthy normolipidemic women aged 21 to 35 years. The formulations contain comparable quantities of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and either desogestrel (DG), a minimally androgenic progestin, or  (LN), a more androgenic progestin.  and lipoprotein levels were measured during the third week of the normal menstrual cycle and the sixth month of OC use. The DG/EE formulation significantly increased total cholesterol (C) 15%, triglyceride (TG) 99%, phospholipid (PL) 17%, apo A-I 28%, apo A-II 34%, apo B 21%, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) 238%, HDL-C 20%, and HDL3-C 28% (P < .02 to .005, n = 11), but not low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The LN/EE formulation also increased total C 15%, TG 33%, apo A-I 15%, HDL3-C 21% (P < .05, n = 10), apo B 30% (P < .005), and, additionally, LDL-C 19% (P < .05). Both formulations increased Lp(AI,AII) (DG/EE, 34%, P < .005; LN/EE, 24%, P < .01). These changes reflected comparable increases of small (7.0 to 8.2 nm) and medium (8.2 to 9.2 nm) particles in the LN/EE group and a predominant increase of medium-sized particles in the DG/EE group. Also, in the LN/EE group but not the DG/EE group, there were fewer large (9.2 to 11.2 nm) particles. Lp(AI) increased only in the DG/EE group (25%, P = .075) and was due to the presence of more large particles. The level of Lp(AI) did not change in the LN/EE group, but the /A-I ratio of these particles was lower (P = .012) and there were more small particles. Thus, triphasic OC formulations with progestins of different androgenicity had different effects on VLDL, LDL, and the level and composition of HDL particles with and without apo A-II, possibly reflecting estrogen/progestin/androgen balance. Estrogen dominance increases both Lp(AI,AII) and Lp(AI) and favors large Lp(AI) particles, while progestin/androgen dominance increases only Lp(AI,AII) and favors small particles. Because of the importance of HDL in the arterial wall physiology, OC formulations with different estrogen and progestin content may affect arterial wall health to a different extent.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30078945>Use of the  Intrauterine Device in Women With Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p> Women with type 2 diabetes are less likely to receive prescriptions for contraceptives despite the fact that diabetes is associated with an increased risk of maternal and fetal complications.

Dosing occurred during the follicular phase. Total and free LNG PK parameters were obtained via serum samples through an indwelling catheter at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5h. The primary outcome was the difference in total and free LNG concentration maximum (Cmax) between ECx1 and ECx2 in the obese group.A total of 10 women enrolled and completed the study (normal BMI=5, median 22.8kg/m(2), range 20.8-23.7; obese BMI=5, 39.5kg/m(2), range 35.9-46.7). The total LNG Cmax for obese subjects following ECx1 (5.57±2.48ng/mL) was significantly lower than the level observed in normal BMI women (10.30±2.47, p=.027). Notably, ECx2 increased the Cmax significantly (10.52±2.76, p=.002); approximating the level in normal BMI subjects receiving ECx1. Free LNG Cmax followed a similar pattern.Obesity adversely impacts both the total and free Cmax levels of LNG EC and this likely explains its lack of efficacy in obese women. Doubling the dose appears to correct the obesity-related PK changes but additional research is needed to determine if this also improves EC effectiveness in obese women.This study demonstrates that obesity interferes with the pharmacokinetics of LNG EC, and that doubling the dose may be an effective strategy to improve its efficacy in obese women.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we investigated whether anti-thyroidal effects are a common property of progestins other than LNG. Premetamorphic Xenopus laevis tadpoles were exposed to norethisterone (NET) and dienogest DIE (each at 0.1-10nM) and LNG (10nM) until completion of metamorphosis. LNG and NET at all concentrations caused a significant developmental retardation whereas DIE did not impair time to metamorphosis. In LNG and 10nM NET exposed animals, tsh mRNA levels increased considerably later than the developmental delay occurred and thyroid histopathology showed no signs of TSH-hyperstimulation. Instead, thyroid glands from these treatments appeared inactive in producing thyroid hormones. Thyroidal transcript levels of dio2 and dio3 were increased by treatments with LNG and NET at 1nM and 10nM, whereas iyd mRNA was reduced by LNG and 10nM NET. Expression of slc5α5 was not changed by any treatment. Effects of DIE differed from those induced by LNG and NET. No developmental delay was measurable; however, tshβ and dio2 mRNAs were increased in pituitary glands of tadpoles exposed to 1.0nM and 10nM DIE. Thyroid histopathology displayed no abnormalities and thyroidal mRNA expression of the genes analyzed (slc5α5, iyd, dio2, dio3) was not changed by DIE. Overall, our results provide evidence that the anti-thyroidal effects already known from LNG are also present in another progestin, namely NET, even at environmentally relevant concentrations.

Cholesterol content of the major lipoproteins along with total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured in fasting blood samples from 32 women volunteers. Results for lipids and lipoproteins determined 6 and 12 months post-NORPLANT insertion were compared with values obtained for samples taken just before implantation. Total serum triglycerides was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) from 1.14 +/- 0.44mmol/l (mean +/- SD) to 0.89 +/- 0.25mmol/l at six and to 0.89 +/- 0.34mmol/l at twelve months post-insertion. Serum total cholesterol was 3.97 +/- 0.53mmol/l at the time of insertion while at six and twelve months post-insertion, they were 3.65 +/- 0.49mmol/l and 3.56 +/- 0.71mmol/l, respectively. These changes in values from the time of insertion to twelve months, were statistically significant (P < 0.02). As regards lipoprotein fractions, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-chol) exhibited statistically significant reduction (P < 0.001) from 1.38 +/- 0.34 mmol/l to 0.71 +/- 0.30 mmol/l (mean +/- SD) six months post-insertion. Although the value had improved to 1.14 +/- 0.38mmol/l by twelve months, the value was still significantly different from the pre-insertion value. The low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-chol) had a mean value (+/- SD) of 2.08 +/- 0.45 mmol/l at the time of insertion. This was significantly elevated (P < 0.001) at six months to 2.54 +/- 0.48mmol/l (mean +/- SD). The twelve-month post-insertion value of LDL-chol (2.02 +/- 0.79) was similar to the pre-insertion value. The shift in HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol within six months followed by a virtual return to the pre-insertion values may represent only a transient change in  of lipids and lipoproteins consequent upon NORPLANT contraception.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1381897>Concentration of , protein, lactose and energy in milk of mothers using hormonal contraceptives.</a></h2><p>Energy, protein, lactose and  were studied in the milk of mothers who were using different types of contraceptives.

Data on their  packed cell volume and menstrual events were analysed at 3, 6, and 12 months of study.The mean age(years) and parity of new Norplant implant acceptors during the period of study were 36. 15.6 and 3.9 1.5 respectively. The mean  (kg) at pre-insertions was 66.5 [10.7] and 67.8 [10.7] and 68.9 [10.5] at 3, 6 and 12 months of Norplant implant use. The analysis of variance did not show statistical significant difference (P < 0.551) in the mean  measured at pre-insertion 66.5 compared to the  at 3, 6 and 12 months of Norplant use.

This study was aimed to report the impact of six-month OCP use on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and factor VIII (FVIII) in women with PCOS.PCOS women diagnosed on the basis of Rotterdam 2003 criteria, either treated with OCPs (ethinyl estradiol-0.03 mg, -0.15 mg) for a period of six months (n=40) or drug-naïve (n=42), were enrolled in this study. Blood was drawn to estimate glucose, insulin levels and lipid profile. Chemiluminescence immunoassays were used to measure hormones (LH, FSH, PRL, T). Plasma levels of PAI-I and FVIII were measured by commercially available kits.Menstrual regularity, Ferriman-Gallwey score and serum total testosterone significantly improved in the OCP group compared to drug-naïve group (P<0.01). No significant difference was observed in PAI-1 levels of the two groups; however, significant decrease in FVIII levels was observed in OCP group as compared to drug-naïve group. PAI-1 levels of OCP group correlated positively with blood glucose two hours, triglycerides and insulin two hours, while FVIII levels of OCP group correlated negatively with fasting insulin and homoeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance.OCPs use has differential effect on pro-coagulant markers among women with PCOS. Well-designed, long-term, prospective, large-scale studies are prerequisite to elucidate the efficacy and safety of OCP in the treatment of PCOS.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'insulin resistance', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17277029>Endothelial function across an oral contraceptive cycle in women using  and ethinyl estradiol.</a></h2><p>Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are a popular contraception method. Currently, lower-dose ethinyl estradiol formulations are most commonly prescribed, although they have been linked to increased arterial vascular risk. The aim of this study was to investigate endothelial function in healthy young women using lower-dose ethinyl estradiol OCPs. We examined flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent and nitroglycerin-mediated, endothelium-independent vasodilation of the brachial artery, comparing two doses of ethinyl estradiol/ OCPs in 15 healthy young women on two study days: once during the active phase and once during the placebo phase of an OCP cycle. Group low dose (LD) (n=7) active pills contained 150 microg /30 microg ethinyl estradiol versus Group very low dose (VLD) (n=8) with 100 microg /20 microg ethinyl estradiol. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was lower during the active phase in Group VLD (5.33 +/- 1.77% vs. 7.23 +/- 2.60%; P=0.024). This phase difference was not observed in Group LD (8.00 +/- 0.970% vs. 7.61 +/- 1.07%; P=0.647). Endothelium-independent vasodilation did not differ between phases in either group. Finally, we measured endothelium-dependent vasodilation in two additional women who received 10 microg of unopposed ethinyl estradiol. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was increased by unopposed ethinyl estradiol compared with the placebo phase (10.88 +/- 2.34% vs. 6.97 +/- 1.83%). These results suggest that  may antagonize the activity of ethinyl estradiol. Thus both the progestin type and estradiol dose need to be considered when assessing arterial vascular risk of OCP use in women.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1324557>Comparative contraceptive efficacy and mechanism of action of the norgestimate-containing triphasic oral contraceptive.</a></h2><p>Norgestimate (NGM), a derivative of 19-nortestosterone with very specific affinity for the progesterone receptor, has been used in combination with ethinyl estradiol (EE) at low doses in both monophasic and triphasic oral contraceptives (OCs).

Contraceptive (LUG)/EE and NGM/EE through a total of 22,312 menstrual cycles. Contraceptive efficacy was excellent with both preparations, with no statistically significant between-regimen differences in pregnancy rates. The theoretical Pearl index was the NGM/EE triphasic, and 0.34 for the LNG/EE triphasic. Adverse experiences in groups were typical of those that may occur among women taking low-dose OC agents. was similar with the two preparations: 8.6% for the NGM/EE triphasic and 6.8% for the LNG/EE triphasic. In a separate mechanism of action study, specific endocrine parameters were investigated in 20 subjects using the NGM/EE triphasic for 4 cycles. Ovulation suppression was demonstrated in statistically significant decreases from pretreatment values in serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, progesterone, and estradiol. Significant on-treatment increases in serum levels of sex hormone binding globulin evidenced minimal androgenicity. All hormonal values returned to or toward normal in the post-treatment cycle. The study results support those obtained in large noncomparative studies of the NGM/EE triphasic. This phased-dose combination suppresses ovulation and is a very effective, minimally androgenic contraceptive agent with a good safety profile.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27000997>The elusive minimum threshold concentration of  for contraceptive efficacy.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2960242>New progestogens in oral contraceptives.</a></h2><p>The aim of using new synthetic progestogens (gestodene and norgestimate) in oral hormonal contraceptives is to find a combination that has a more beneficial effect on  and endometrium than presently available formulations.

This tumour is rarely diagnosed in the reproductive age. Complete surgical resection is the only curative treatment for adrenal cancer in all stages. After surgery adjuvant chemotherapy is required. Mitotane is the most important drug in adrenal cancer chemotherapy. Mitotane's mode of action is not entirely explained. Animal studies have shown that the substance exerts a direct cytotoxic effect on the cells of the adrenal cortex. This activity is selective, progressive and affects only the zona reticularis and fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. Mitotane inhibits cortisol synthesis by disrupting the chain of cholesterol.

However, recent clinical trials have identified side effects of LNG-IUD that appear to be systemically mediated, including depressed mood and emotional lability.We performed two experimental studies and a cross-sectional study. For each study, women were included from three groups: LNG-IUD (0.02mg/24h), oral ethinylestradiol/ (0.03mg/0.15mg; EE30/LNG) and natural cycling (NC). Study 1-Salivary cortisol was measured at baseline and at defined intervals following the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Heart rate was monitored continuously throughout the TSST. Study 2-Salivary cortisol and serum total cortisol were evaluated relative to low-dose (1μg) adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration.

The patch samples are prepared by swelling with acetonitrile (ACN) and the separation is performed by Zorbax Eclipse XDB ODS columns. A proper retention range is first determined with a binary mobile phase of ACN and water based on the general resolution equation. The interference to estradiol from a  impurity is then eliminated by a ternary mobile phase of acetonitrile-methanol-water with a composition predicted by LSERs. When the resolution is optimized and the "open window" in the chromatogram for an internal standard is selected, LSERs are used to predict the candidate compounds to be evaluated as the internal standard. The approach described in this study can be used, in general, to considerably improve the efficiency of RPLC method development, particularly for neutral samples. Finally, the LSER approach for the selectivity optimization is compared with a statistical response surface methodology (RSM) based on a central composite design (CCD) in terms of the effectiveness and number of experiments. It is concluded that, although the predicted mobile phase composition to achieve the desired selectivity is about the same, the LSER approach is more efficient and fewer experiments are required.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17891597>Effects on  and  composition of a low-dose oral estroprogestin containing ethinyl estradiol 20 microg plus  100 microg.</a></h2><p> gain is a common problem reported by users of estroprogestins (EPs) and is a frequent reason for EP discontinuation, even if this problem is not confirmed in several clinical studies.

The progestin-only pills (Micronor and Ovrette), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injections (Depo-Provera and depo-subQ provera 104),  intrauterine system (IUS) (Mirena), and etonogestrel implant (Implanon) will be reviewed. The use of  (Plan B) as an emergency contraceptive will also be considered briefly.Worldwide medical literature and the prescribing information for the specified products.A number of POCs are currently available for routine birth control in the United States, ranging from the daily progestin-only pill to nondaily contraceptive options such as injectable DMPA, the -releasing IUS, and the etonogestrel-releasing contraceptive implant. Each of these methods has specific advantages, but also specific drawbacks that can result in discontinuation of treatment if users are not given adequate information about what to expect in terms of side effects. It is critical that clinicians provide adequate and accurate information along with detailed counseling to women who are considering using POCs, as well as providing periodic reinforcement of the information at regular clinic visits for those already using POCs.Given that a large number of pregnancies are unplanned and create a significant impact on social, economic, and health outcomes, it is important for the clinician to have a vast knowledge of contraceptive options. POCs offer significant choices in contraception. By proactively addressing common concerns (such as potential effects on , mood, menstrual bleeding patterns, and bone mineral density), clinicians may improve the likelihood of adherence and continuation with POCs for routine birth control.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12316812>Effects of the triphasic oral contraceptive on  and lipoprotein .</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15199494>Venous and arterial thrombosis during oral contraceptive use: risks and risk factors.</a></h2><p>Since the introduction of oral contraceptives, their use has been associated with an increased risk of both venous and arterial thrombosis. Pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke are serious disorders with a considerable risk of mortality. Because worldwide over 100 million women use oral contraceptives, issues of drug safety are of great importance. The risk of venous thrombosis during low-dose oral contraceptive use is three- to sixfold increased compared with that of nonusers. The association is not only attributed to the estrogen component of the pill: the risk is twice as high for desogestrel and gestodene (third generation) containing oral contraceptives as for  (second generation) containing oral contraceptives. The risk of venous thrombosis is highest in the first year of use and in women with genetic or acquired risk factors for thrombosis. Both venous or arterial thrombosis are unrelated to duration of use or past use of combined oral contraceptives. The risk of myocardial infarction and stroke during low-dose oral contraceptive use is two- to fivefold increased relative to that of nonusers. The risk of arterial thrombosis induced by oral contraceptive use is more pronounced in smokers and women with hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. All types of thrombosis have strongly age-dependent incidences, and therefore in absolute figures the risks and effects of risk factors increase with age. The lowering of the estrogen dose in combined oral contraceptives from 50 microg to 20-30 microg in the last decade did not clearly reduce the risk of venous thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. For stroke and peripheral arterial disease no difference in risk was found between second and third generation oral contraceptives. For myocardial infarction study results are conflicting, and a small benefit of third- over second-generation oral contraceptives cannot be ruled out. However, this is unlikely to counterbalance the adverse effect of third generation contraceptives on venous thrombosis.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1748246>Preconception counseling and contraception after gestational .</a></h2><p>Women with gestational  (GDM) diagnosed in the period 1978-1984 were followed for on average 6 yr after the index pregnancy.

Endometrial leukocytes have no genomic progesterone receptors; thus, we hypothesized that leukocyte migration is induced indirectly by progesterone-regulated chemokines. Fractalkine (CX3CL1), a chemotactic membrane-bound adhesion factor, and its receptor (CX3CR1) were assessed by immunohistochemistry in endometrial samples across the menstrual cycle, in early pregnancy, and in women using progestin-only contraceptives. Fractalkine was localized predominantly to glandular epithelial and decidualized stromal cells, with the highest staining intensity in the secretory phase and early pregnancy. It was also detected in subpopulations of endometrial leukocytes (macrophages and uterine NK cells), with maximal numbers during the proliferative phase and early pregnancy. CX3CR1 was similarly colocalized to the glandular epithelium and decidualized stromal cells, with the highest expression in the secretory phase. CX3CR1-positive leukocytes (macrophages and neutrophils) were in greatest abundance during the menstrual phase. In the endometrium of women using progestin-only contraceptives, immunoreactive fractalkine was markedly reduced in the glandular epithelium, but was increased in decidualized stroma and infiltrating leukocytes. These findings support a number of roles for fractalkine in the endometrium, in the secretory phase, in early pregnancy, and when influenced by progestin-only contraceptives.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9347205>Bone mineral density during long-term treatment with Norplant implants and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate.

All measurements were done after long-term HRT (baseline), after 4 weeks pause and again 3 weeks after reintroduction of HRT. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI concentrations were significantly higher and LDL to HDL ratio significantly lower after long-term oestradiol valerate therapy than after combined therapy. Simultaneously, the triglyceride and lipoprotein (a) levels were higher in the estrogen group. Susceptibility of LDL to oxidation and the level of 8-iso-PGF2alpha were similar in both groups at all measurement points, and treatment group was not a statistically significant determinant of these markers at baseline. According to these results, estrogen and combined HRT do not differ in their abilities to oppose LDL oxidation in vitro or systemic oxidative stress in vivo, but have differential effects on blood lipids.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27138968>Evaluation of the Effect of Tofacitinib on the Pharmacokinetics of Oral Contraceptive Steroids in Healthy Female Volunteers.</a></h2><p>Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor.

Among the mechanisms of this benefit are antioxidant effects on LDL and the arterial wall. Because progestins oppose the effect of estrogen in several systems, we asked if progestins oppose the antioxidant effect of estrogen. To study this question, LDL and various female sex hormones were incubated alone and combined in the absence or presence of bovine aortic endothelial cells, placental trophoblast, or macrophages, and LDL oxidation and cytotoxicity were quantitated. In the absence of cells, LDL incubated with copper in phosphate-buffered saline enhanced the oxidation of LDL. When 17beta-estradiol was added to this system, an antioxidant effect was observed. Progestins inhibited this protective estrogenic effect. In endothelial cell culture, progestins also opposed the antioxidant effect of estrogen, with the strongest antiestrogenic effect seen with the synthetic progestins,  and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Endothelial cell cytotoxicity was proportional to the enhanced  peroxide formation observed with progestins or estrogen. Similar opposing effects were seen when estrogen and progesterone were added to primary cultures of placental trophoblast or macrophages. Thus, three cell culture systems modeling circulating arterial blood contact with cell surfaces demonstrated opposing effects of estrogens and progestins on LDL oxidation and cell cytotoxicity.

Aetiology is due to underlying uterine pathologies, coagulopathy, ovulation dysfunction, or iatrogenic. Up to 20% of women with HMB will have an underlying inherited bleeding disorder (IBD). Assessment of HMB should entail a menstrual and gynaecological history and a bleeding score to distinguish those women who require additional haematological investigations. A pelvic examination and ultrasound scan help to rule out presence of any underlying pathology. Management depends on the underlying cause and the woman's preference and her fertility wishes. Medical therapies include hormonal treatments; -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and combined hormonal contraceptives are most commonly used. Ulipristal acetate is an approved preoperative treatment for uterine fibroids, and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing MBL. Haemostatic therapies include tranexamic acid and DDAVP (1-deamino-8-D-arginine). DDAVP is used for HMB associated with certain IBDs. These therapies can be used in isolation or in combination with hormonal treatments. HMB associated with certain severe IBDs may require factor concentrate administration during menses to alleviate symptoms.

In postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, progestins are used in combination with estrogen as hormone-replacement therapy (HRT). The development of new generations of progestins with improved selectivity profiles has been a great challenge. Steroidal and nonsteroidal progesterone-receptor (PR) agonists have been synthesised as well, although the latter are still in a very early stage of development. Several new progestins, which have been synthesised in the last 2 decades, may be considered fourth-generation progestins. These include dienogest, drospirenone, Nestorone (Population Council, New York, NY, USA), nomegestrol acetate and trimegestone. The fourth-generation progestins have been designed to have no androgenic or estrogenic actions and to be closer in activity to the physiological hormone progesterone. Drospirenone differs from the classic progestins as it is derived from spirolactone. It is essentially an antimineralocorticoid steroid with no androgenic effect but a partial antiandrogenic effect. The antiovulatory potency of the different progestins varies. Trimegestone and Nestorone are the most potent progestins synthesised to date, followed by two of the older progestins, 3-keto-desogestrel and . The new molecules trimegestone, drospirenone and dienogest also have antiandrogenic activity. Following the publication of the results of the Women's Health Initiative study, the role of progestins in HRT became controversial. Unfortunately, this concern has been directed towards progestins as a class, although striking differences exist among the progestins. Natural progesterone and some of its derivatives, such as the 19-norprogesterone molecules, and the new molecules drospirenone and dienogest are not androgenic and, therefore, have no negative effect on the  profile. The effects of progestins on breast tissue remain controversial as well. However, depending on the progestin and the duration of application, breast cell differentiation and apoptosis may predominate over proliferation. It is still unclear if the currently available progestins are able to bind specifically to the PR isoforms PR-A or PR-B and whether this is of clinical relevance to breast cell proliferation is also unclear. Although it is likely that the new progestins may have neutral effects on the risk of coronary heart disease or breast cancer in younger postmenopausal women, this hypothesis must be confirmed in large randomised, well controlled clinical trials.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711501>Comparing the androgenic and estrogenic properties of progestins used in contraception and hormone therapy.</a></h2><p>Progestins used in endocrine therapies bind to multiple steroid receptors and are associated with several side-effects. It is thus important to understand the relationship between steroid receptor cross-reactivity and the side-effect profile of progestins. In cell lines that express negligible levels of steroid receptors, we report for the first time the binding affinities, potencies and efficacies of selected progestins from different generations determined in parallel. We show that the progestins bind to the androgen receptor (AR) with similar affinities to each other and progesterone, while none bind estrogen receptor (ER)-β, and only norethisterone acetate,  and gestodene bind ERα. Comparative dose-response analysis revealed that progestins from the first three generations display similar androgenic activity to the natural androgen dihydrotestosterone for transactivation, while norethisterone acetate,  and gestodene are ERα agonists. We show for the first time that the anti-androgenic properties of progesterone and drospirenone are similar to the well-known AR antagonist hydroxyflutamide, while nomegestrol acetate is more potent and nestorone less potent than both hydroxyflutamide and progesterone. Moreover, we are the first to report that the older progestins, unlike progesterone and the fourth generation progestins, are efficacious ERα agonists for transrepression, while the selected progestins from the second and third generation are efficacious AR agonists for transrepression. Considering the progestin potencies and their reported free serum concentrations relative to dihydrotestosterone and estradiol, our results suggest that the progestins are likely to exert AR-, but not ERα- or ERβ-mediated effects in vivo.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Sixty healthy women aged 18-35 years requesting oral contraception were allocated alternately to use a monophasic oral contraceptive containing 30 micrograms ethinyloestradiol and 150 micrograms desogestrel (Marvelon, group A), or a triphasic oral contraceptive containing 30-40 micrograms ethinyloestradiol and 50-125 micrograms  (Triphasil, group B). The changes in the lipoprotein profile elicited by the two preparations differed significantly. Group A subjects had a much greater triglyceridaemic response (42.4%) than group B (14.6%) and had a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo-A1). In group B, HDL-C decreased and Apo-A1 showed little change. Non-HDL-C (NHDL-C) and Apo-B levels hardly changed in either group. The atherogenic ratios, NHDL-C/HDL-C and Apo-B/Apo-A1 were higher in group B. This study confirmed a significant difference in the response of plasma lipoproteins to the two oral contraceptive preparations. The evidence suggests that the desogestrel-containing oral contraceptive elicits a less atherogenic lipoprotein profile than does the -containing preparation. Although unsupported by direct clinical evidence that changes in the lipoprotein pattern induced by oral contraceptives cause atherosclerosis, these effects should be considered when prescribing oral contraceptives for women who have risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2115298>Metabolic changes during treatment with two different progestogens.</a></h2><p>Two triphasic oral contraceptives containing the same amount of ethinyl estradiol in combination with gestodene or  were compared with respect to contraceptive effect, on  and coagulation.

Before treatment and in the third and sixth cycles, blood sample were drawn in the morning while subjects were still in bed to obtain basal conditions. The contraceptive effect and cycle control were good with both preparations, and there were only a few minor side effects. Sex hormone-binding globulin was elevated twofold in the  group and threefold in the gestodene group. The gestodene concentration in serum varied more than the  concentration, but with correction for variations in sex hormone-binding globulin binding, less variability in gestodene and  concentrations were seen. High-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol decreased in the  group but was unchanged in the gestodene group, whereas apolipoprotein A1 increased in the gestodene group but not in the  group. Antithrombin III decreased in the gestodene group but was unchanged in -treated women. Factor VII increased in both groups but more in the gestodene group. We conclude that gestodene has a positive influence on , probably because of its lower androgenicity, and a slightly negative influence on coagulation. The latter, however, probably has no clinical relevance.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21212911>Desogestrel+ethinylestradiol versus +ethinylestradiol.

At present, eight products from six companies are under clinical development. Ethinyl estradiol (30-35 micrograms per tablet) as an estrogen component is common to all the test drugs. The progestin component in each OC is norethindrone, , or desogestrel. Phase I clinical studies on small numbers of healthy volunteers showed that they could tolerate the test drugs without any serious complaints. The effects on endocrine systems, including the inhibition of ovulation, were also examined. Pharmacokinetic parameters of active ingredients were comparable to those of Western women, and no substantial difference seemed to exist between Japanese and Western women. As an example, the results of phase I studies of OJK-777 (Ortho-Novum 7/7/7) are mentioned. Phase III clinical studies, which are "open studies," are now under progress with more than 3,000 women. The major objectives are to examine (1) how well the drugs are tolerated, and the dropout rates; (2) the effects on cycle control, especially bleeding patterns; (3) effects on the cardiovascular system, including coagulation and ; (4) effects on hormone secretions.

Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in English from January 1994 to January 2015. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to June 2015. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.The quality of the evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table). Chapter 1: Contraception in Canada Summary Statements  1. Canadian women spend a significant portion of their lives at risk of an unintended pregnancy. (II-2)  2. Effective contraceptive methods are underutilized in Canada, particularly among vulnerable populations. (II-2)  3. Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, including contraceptive implants and intrauterine contraception (copper-releasing and -releasing devices/systems), are the most effective reversible contraceptive methods and have the highest continuation rates. (II-1)  4. Canada currently does not collect reliable data to determine the use of contraceptive methods, abortion rates, and the prevalence of unintended pregnancy among reproductive-age women. (II-2)  5. A universal subsidy for contraceptive methods as provided by many of Canada's peer nations and a few Canadian provinces may produce health system cost-savings. (II-2)  6. Health Canada approval processes for contraceptives have been less efficient than those of other drug approval agencies and Health Canada processes for other classes of pharmaceuticals. (II-2)  7. It is feasible and safe for contraceptives and family planning services to be provided by appropriately trained allied health professionals such as midwives, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists. (II-2) Recommendations 1. Contraceptive counselling should include a discussion of typical use failure rates and the importance of using the contraceptive method consistently and correctly in order to avoid pregnancy. (II-2A) 2. Women seeking contraception should be counselled on the wide range of effective methods of contraception available, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARCs). LARCs are the most effective methods of reversible contraception, have high continuation rates, and should be considered when presenting contraceptive options to any woman of reproductive age. (II-2A) 3. Family planning counselling should include counselling on the decline of fertility associated with increasing female age. (III-A) 4. Health policy supporting a universal contraception subsidy and strategies to promote the uptake of highly effective methods as cost-saving  that improve health and health equity should be considered by Canadian health decision makers. (III-B) 5. Canadian health jurisdictions should consider expanding the scope of practice of other trained professionals such as nurses, nurse practitioners, midwives, and pharmacists and promoting task-sharing in family planning. (II-2B) 6. The Canadian Community Health Survey should include adequate reproductive health indicators in order for health care providers and policy makers to make appropriate decisions regarding reproductive health policies and services in Canada. (III-B) 7. Health Canada processes and policies should be reviewed to ensure a wide range of modern contraceptive methods are available to Canadian women. (III-B) Chapter 2: Contraceptive Care and Access Summary Statements  8. Although there are many contraceptive options in Canada, only a narrow range of contraceptive methods are commonly used by those of reproductive age. (II-3)  9. Condom use decreases with longer relationship tenure and when the sexual partner is considered to be the main partner, likely due to a lower perceived risk of sexually transmitted infection in that relationship. Condom use may also decrease markedly as an unintended consequence when an effective non-barrier method, such as hormonal contraception or intrauterine contraception, is initiated. (II-3) 10. Family planning counselling provides a natural segue into screening for concerns about sexual function or intimate partner violence. (III) 11. Well-informed and well-motivated individuals who have developed skills to practise safer sex behaviours are more likely to use contraceptive and safer sex methods effectively and consistently. (II-2) Recommendations 8. Comprehensive family planning services, including abortion services, should be accessible to all Canadians regardless of geographic location. These services should be confidential, non-judgemental, and respectful of individuals' privacy and cultural contexts. (III-A) 9. A contraceptive visit should include history taking, screening for contraindications, dispensing or prescribing a method of contraception, and exploring contraceptive choice and adherence in the broader context of the individual's sexual behaviour, reproductive health risk, social circumstances, and relevant belief systems. (III-B) 10. Health care providers should provide practical information on the wide range of contraceptive options and their potential non-contraceptive benefits and assist women and their partners in determining the best user-method fit. (III-B) 11. Health care providers should assist women and men in developing the skills necessary to negotiate the use of contraception and the correct and consistent use of a chosen method. (III-B) 12. Contraceptive care should include discussion and management of the risk of sexually transmitted infection, including appropriate recommendations for condom use and dual protection, STI screening, post-exposure prophylaxis, and Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccination. (III-B) 13. Health care providers should emphasize the use of condoms not only for protection against sexually transmitted infection, but also as a back-up method when adherence to a hormonal contraceptive may be suboptimal. (I-A) 14. Health care providers should be aware of current media controversies in reproductive health and acquire relevant evidence-based information that can be briefly and directly communicated to their patients. (III-B) 15. Referral resources for intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, sexual dysfunction, induced abortion services, and child protection services should be available to help clinicians provide contraceptive care in the broader context of women's health. (III-B) Chapter 3: Emergency Contraception Summary Statements 12. The copper intrauterine device is the most effective method of emergency contraception. (II-2) 13. A copper intrauterine device can be used for emergency contraception up to 7 days after unprotected intercourse provided that pregnancy has been ruled out and there are no other contraindications to its insertion. (II-2) 14.  emergency contraception is effective up to 5 days (120 hours) after intercourse; its effectiveness decreases as the time between unprotected intercourse and ingestion increases. (II-2) 15. Ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is more effective than  emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. This difference in effectiveness is more pronounced as the time from unprotected intercourse increases, especially after 72 hours. (I) 16. Hormonal emergency contraception ( emergency contraception and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception) is not effective if taken on the day of ovulation or after ovulation. (II-2) 17.  emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a  mass index > 25 kg/m2 and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a  mass index > 35 kg/m2. However, hormonal emergency contraception may still retain some effectiveness regardless of a woman's  or  mass index. (II-2) 18. Hormonal emergency contraception is associated with higher failure rates when women continue to have subsequent unprotected intercourse. (II-2) 19. Hormonal contraception can be initiated the day of or the day following the use of  emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 7 days. (III) 20. Hormonal contraception can be initiated 5 days following the use of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 14 days. (III) Recommendations 16. All emergency contraception should be initiated as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. (II-2A) 17. Women should be informed that the copper intrauterine device (IUD) is the most effective method of emergency contraception and can be used by any woman with no contraindications to IUD use.

The ENG-implant has both well established safety and efficacy for up to 3 years. Pharmacokinetic data on ENG show high levels at 3 years and some previous clinical research confirms efficacy beyond the current approved duration of 3 years. Today, many women, because the labeled duration has been reached, have the ENG implant removed at 3 years, increasing costs, inconvenience and risks.For the first 3 years, this study was an open-label, multi-centre randomized trial comparing the 3-year ENG implant to the 5-year  (LNG)-releasing implant. After 3 years, a subset of 390 ENG participants, consented to extended use. We compared efficacy, side effects and removal procedures of both implants. We used Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis. We included an observational cohort of copper intrauterine device (IUD) users as non-users of hormonal contraceptive method for comparative purposes.The study took place in family planning clinics in seven countries worldwide. Women were enlisted after an eligibility check and informed consent, and 1328 women were enrolled: 390, 522 and 416 in the ENG-implant, LNG-implant and IUD groups, respectively.Over 200 women used the ENG implant for at least 5 years. No pregnancies occurred during the additional 2 years of follow up in the ENG or LNG implant group. The overall 5-year K-M cumulative pregnancy rates for ENG- and LNG- implants were 0.6 per 100 women-years (W-Y) [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2-1.8] and 0.8 per 100 W-Y [95% CI: 0.2-2.3], respectively. Complaints of bleeding changes were similar; however, ENG-users were more likely than LNG-users to experience heavy bleeding (p < 0.05). The median duration of the implant removal procedure was 64 seconds shorter for the one-rod ENG-implant (inter-quartile range (IQR) = 30.5, 117.5) compared to the two-rod LNG product (IQR = 77.0, 180.0). The 2-year rate for pregnancy in the IUD group compared with the two implant groups combined was 4.1 per 100 W-Y [95% CI: 2.5-6.5].Few women were ≤19 years old or nulligravida. Although there was no  limit for enrolment in the study, the number of women ≥70 kg were few.The results from this study corroborate previous evidence showing high contraceptive efficacy through 4 years for the ENG-implant. Data through 5 years are a novel contribution and further proof of the product's capability to provide safe and effective contraception that rivals the current 5-year LNG-subdermal implant. The findings provide valuable information for policy makers, family planning programmers and clinicians that the ENG-releasing subdermal implant is still highly effective up to 5 years after insertion.

However, based on some new data, we are discovering that this pathology can emerge or reappear at this period of life. Clinicians must consider it as a possible cause for cases of pelvic pain, and heavy bleeding.

Both with and without APC, plasmas of OC users exhibited the shortest lag time and time to peak, and the highest peak height and ETP. In the absence of APC none of these parameters differed between users of OC containing different progestogens. In contrast, in the presence of APC shorter lag times and time to peak, and higher peak height and ETP were observed in plasma of users of gestodene-, desogestrel-, drospirenone- and cyproterone acetate-containing OC than in plasma of users of - containing OC. The ETP determined in the absence of APC (ETP(-APC)) had no predictive value for the APCsr (r = 0.11; slope 0.9 x 10(-3); 95% CI: -0.1 x 10(-3) to 2.0 x 10(-3)) whereas the ETP measured in the presence of APC (ETP+APC) showed an excellent correlation with the APCsr (r = 0.95; slope 6.6 x 10(-3); 95% CI: 6.3 x 10(-3) to 6.9 x 10(-3)) indicating that the APCsr is entirely determined by the ETP+APC.

While nomegestrol is derived from 19-norprogesterone, the other compounds are 19-nortestosterone derivatives: desogestrel, norgestimate and gestodene belong to the subgroup of 13-ethyl-gonanes with an ethinyl group at C17 alpha, and dienogest represents an estrane (13-methyl-gonane) with a cyanomethyl group at C17 alpha. Both dienogest and nomegestrol have antiandrogenic properties. In proportion to the dose, the highest serum concentrations are observed after intake of gestodene. When combined with ethinylestradiol, gestodene and 3-keto-desogestrel accumulate in serum during daily treatment because of slowed-down elimination. This is probably caused both by binding to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and by inhibition of inactivating enzymes. Dienogest does not accumulate in serum, although at a dose of 2 mg very high serum concentrations of dienogest are reached. The most potent progestogens are gestodene and desogestrel, while the effect of dienogest and nomegestrol on endometrium and cervix is less, even though in a similar range. As the ovulation-inhibiting effect is brought about not only by receptor-mediated interactions but also by a direct inhibition of steroid biosynthesis, dienogest and nomegestrol are much less effective than gestodene, desogestrel and norgestimate. Ethinylated progestogens, particularly gestodene, have been demonstrated to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. Both gestodene and desogestrel may moderately reduce SHBG levels and counteract the stimulating effect of ethinylestradiol on hepatic serum proteins, while dienogest and nomegestrol have no influence. Compared with progestogens with androgenic properties which may restrict the stimulatory action of ethinylestradiol on haemostatic parameters, the newer progestogens do not seem to be superior with respect to haemostasis. There are no data on the direct effect of the compounds on the arterial and venous vessel wall. Due to the less pronounced antagonism on ethinylestradiol-induced changes in , the newer progestogens appear to be beneficial rather than deleterious, although atherosclerosis was probably not promoted by the older formulations because of the direct effect of ethinylestradiol on the arterial wall. There is no evidence for a lesser impact of the newer progestogens on carbohydrate , which is mostly impaired by the estrogen component in oral contraceptives. Formulations containing the newer progestogens are, however, preferable in patients with hyperandrogenaemia, the symptoms of which may be improved by the suppression of total and free testosterone and an increase in SHBG; an additional beneficial effect of the antiandrogenic properties of dienogest or nomegestrol remains to be proven.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1436906>The new era in oral contraception: pills containing gestodene, norgestimate, and desogestrel.</a></h2><p>The latest advance in the 30-year evolution of oral contraceptives (OCs) is the development of three new progestogens: desogestrel, norgestimate, and gestodene. These three new agents are derivatives of , a gonane hormone, and have been used to develop pills that provide effective pregnancy prevention at lower doses than oral contraceptives using the older steroids. Desogestrel is a prohormone that must first be metabolized into its biologically active form. Norgestimate is already active, but it will be metabolized in part to . Gestodene is biologically active in its native form. Among the improvements in metabolic parameters seen with this new generation of progestogens are a lack of impact on blood pressure, a balanced effect on coagulation, and a reduced impact on carbohydrate  compared with earlier, higher-dose formulations. The new pills also seem to produce no negative effects on  and lipoprotein biosynthesis, and perhaps even improve the ratio of low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein. Cycle control with all three progestogens is improved, with much lower incidence of intermenstrual bleeding (IMB). Efficacy is as good as with other OCs. Another benefit of the new low-dose progestogens, however, is the low incidence of minor side effects observed in women using these contraceptives. Low incidences of weight gain, headache, and nausea were reported, and the dropout rate because of side effects was low in both international and US trials. Serious side effects are rarely seen with pills containing the new progestogens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1789355>[Hormonal contraception].</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21848413>Amenorrhea and BMI as independent determinants of patient satisfaction in LNG-IUD users: cross-sectional study in a Central European district.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the satisfaction of women carrying the LNG-IUD and determined influencing factors, especially considering bleeding patterns and  mass index (BMI).Cross sectional study.Gynecological offices in a Central European district.1825 women aged between 18 and 60 years.While sitting in the waiting room, voluntary patients had to answer a questionnaire about their experiences with the  intrauterine device.

Nevertheless, they rarely discussed the Cu-IUD, even in circumstances where LNG-EC could be less effective, such as delayed presentation or for women with BMI >25 kg/m. Some pharmacists felt conflicted in their dual roles as health care and customer service provider when counselling about and selling EC, and many felt uncomfortable discussing . Pharmacists were not well informed about the Cu-IUD. They identified many pharmacist-specific barriers to counselling about the Cu-IUD for EC, as well as health systems issues around Cu-IUD provision and insertion.Ontario pharmacists embraced their role in EC counselling, yet their discussions rarely included the most effective Cu-IUD option. Educating and training pharmacists about the Cu-IUD and establishing referral pathways for IUD insertion could expand their counselling about this EC option.Copyright © 2017 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada/La Société des obstétriciens et gynécologues du Canada.

The PR crystallizes as a dimer forming two monomers (mA and mB), in which Gln725 interacts in either of two possible ways with the C3-carbonyl pharmacophore of progestins. P binds differentially to both PR monomers, while NET binds exclusively as mA and LNG binds only as mB in both monomers with no difference. Energetically, binding of LNG and P to mB, is more favorable than that of NET and P to mA. Consequently, this bimodal mechanism increases the action possibilities of SPs on biological systems. Interestingly, progestin potency depends mostly on local molecular structure and electronic features, prevailing over total molecular properties.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The mean serum bilirubin during the second year remained significantly raised from its preinsertion value (p less than 0.001). Furthermore the total proteins and globulin were still significantly decreased (p less than 0.001). Thus with respect to liver function, the results still indicate possible dysfunction at the end of two years. As regards , the serum triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol still remained significantly decreased at the end of two years when compared to preinsertion values. The HDL-cholesterol levels which showed no significant change during the first year of use decreased significantly during the second year of use. As a result the HDL-cholesterol/Total cholesterol - HDL-cholesterol decreased significantly and was 12.0% lower than the pre-insertion ratio (p less than 0.01). Similarly the LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol increased during the second year of use and was 2.6% higher than its preinsertion ratio. However, this increase was still not statistically significant. As we have not incorporated a simultaneous non-steroid treated control group, the observed changes in  could be attributed to extraneous factors such as diet, exercise or other environmental changes. Nevertheless, the findings at the end of two years, though speculative, still indicate Norplant-2 use to be non-contributory to cardiovascular risk in this population. The use of Norplant-2 was not associated with any significant effect on glucose tolerance after two years of use.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8172528>Comparative assessment of the effects of subdermal  implant system and long acting progestogen injection method on .</a></h2><p>In order to compare the effects of two type of long-acting progestogen contraceptive methods with subdermal  (LNG) implants and depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injections on , a clinical cohort study was performed by requiring 25 women in each group adopting either LNG implant or DMPA injection method voluntarily. After 6 months of use, serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were determined and compared between the two groups of acceptors. The mean of total cholesterol in LNG implant acceptors was significantly lower than that in DMPA injection acceptors. The mean values of HDL-cholesterol in LNG implant acceptors (41.7 +/- 7.7 mg/dl) and in DMPA injection acceptors (45.0 +/- 9.0 mg/dl) were in the normal range without significant difference between the two groups. The mean value of triglycerides did not differ significantly between LNG implant acceptors (77.6 +/- 25.1 mg/dl) and DMPA injection acceptors (91.0 +/- 30.3 mg/dl). Serum concentrations of  fractions such as HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in LNG implant acceptors were relatively low compared to those in DMPA injection acceptors. Since there was a comparable reduction in both total-and HDL-cholesterol levels in the LNG implant group, the ratio of total-to HDL-cholesterol, which is thought to be a factor in determining the risk of coronary artery disease, remained in the normal range (2 +/- 4.5).

The absolute risk of VTE in users of combined oral contraceptives is 20-30 per 100000 women years. A number of case-control studies published in recent years have shown an apparent increase in the risk of VTE among users of oral contraceptives (OCs) containing desogestrel, gestodene, drospirenone and cyproterone, relative to the use of . The data derived from these recent studies is of borderline statistical significance because any important factors are not considered to evaluate the real correlation between the assumption of OCs and risk of venous thromboembolism. Among the factors that should be considered, there are: EE dose, duration of use, coexistance of other risk factors of venous thromboembolism (age, BMI, familiarity, surgical interventions) and other prescription bias. The lack of these factors is likely to contribute to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism observed in users of third-generation OCs when compared to that in users of second-generation OCs. To date, because of the inadequacy of epidemiological studies, the data about the correlation between OCs and TVE, are not conclusive and it will be necessary to carry out other studies to clarify this debating point, definitively.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19637436>Intrauterine devices: an effective alternative to oral hormonal contraception.</a></h2><p>(1) Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are placed in the uterine cavity with the objective of providing long-term contraception, mainly by preventing fertilisation. The best-known IUDs contain copper, but there is also an IUD delivering , a progestin; (2) How effective are these devices, and what are their adverse effects? To answer these questions, we analysed the literature using the standard Prescrire methodology; (3) T-shaped copper IUDs, with a copper surface area of 380 mm2 on 3 arms, and the -releasing device, have similar contraceptive efficacy as combined oral contraceptives that are used correctly. In contrast, IUDs are more effective than oral contraception used incorrectly; (4) Among IUD users, there are on average about 6 pregnancies per 1000 woman-years. There is less experience with the  IUD which seems to be at least as effective as copper IUDs; (5) The rare intrauterine pregnancies that occur in women using an IUD generally end in miscarriage. About 25% of these pregnancies end in a live birth if the device is left in place, compared to about 90% if the device is removed; (6) Ectopic pregnancies are rarer in IUD users than in women who do not use contraception. However, about one in 20 pregnancies that occur in women using an IUD is ectopic; (7) The IUD is expelled in about 5% to 10% of cases within 5 years, and expulsion recurs in about 30% of these women; (8) Problems such as difficult insertion, pain, bleeding and syncope are reported in less than 1.5% of cases overall; (9) Uterine perforation during insertion is rare, occurring in 0.6 to 16 cases per 1000 insertions, regardless of the type of IUD. The risk of perforation is higher when the IUD is inserted less than 4 to 6 weeks after delivery or elective abortion; (10) During the first 3 months after insertion, the risk of pelvic infection is slightly higher than in the general population, especially in women with pre-existing asymptomatic Chlamydia trachomatis infection. There are about 6 pelvic infections per 1000 woman-years of IUD use. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is unnecessary. The interview and physical examination may lead to diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection or other sexually transmitted infections. In these cases, treatment may be needed before IUD insertion. Women must be warned that IUDs do not protect them from sexually transmitted diseases; (11) Menstrual bleeding is often heavier in women with cooper IUDs than in women who do not use IUDs, and may be associated with menstrual pain; (12) The  IUD is associated with a marked reduction in menstrual blood loss and irregular bleeding; amenorrhoea occurs in 35% of women after 2 years of use. The  IUD also has hormonal adverse effects such as headache, acne, breast tension and functional ovarian cysts; (13) IUDs can safely be used in breastfeeding women, immediately after a pregnancy, in cases of diabetes or HIV infection, during nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy, and after an ectopic pregnancy. The only problems occurring in women who have never had children are pain during insertion and more frequent expulsions; (14) A copper IUD is a first-line contraceptive method for women with a history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or coronary events; (15) It is better to postpone IUD insertion when the woman has a genital tract infection or unexplained vaginal bleeding; (16) IUD insertion is an effective alternative to "morning-after" hormonal contraception.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26040939>Effects of a -Releasing Intrauterine System on the Expression of Steroid Receptor Coregulators in Adenomyosis.</a></h2><p>Although the pathophysiology of adenomyosis has not been clarified, it is thought to be related to ectopic endometrium, which depends on hormonal regulation. The -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is effective for the medical treatment of adenomyosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which LNG-IUS ameliorates adenomyosis pathology remain unclear. This study was designed to compare the expression levels of steroid receptor coregulators in human endometrium of control and participants with adenomyosis and to determine whether LNG-IUS modulated their expression. Immunohistochemistry with H-scores was performed. Steroid receptor coactivators were shown to have significantly decreased expressions at the secretory phase in the LNG-IUS group when compared to the other groups. Expression of transcriptional intermediary factor 2 was lower in the LNG-IUS group than in both the control group (P = .015) and the untreated adenomyosis group (P = .019) during the secretory phase. Amplified in breast cancer 1 expression was higher in the stromal cells of the untreated adenomyosis group than in those of the controls (P = .017) during the secretory phase; however, levels were lower in the LNG-IUS group (P = .005). Nuclear receptor corepressor expression increased during the proliferative phase and decreased during the secretory phase in untreated adenomyosis; this pattern was reversed in the control and LNG-IUS groups. Thus, an altered expression of steroid receptor coregulators may play a role in adenomyosis development and treatment.© The Author(s) 2015.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1648654>Effect of oral contraception on water-suppressed proton NMR spectra of plasma.</a></h2><p> linewidths were measured in the plasma proton spectra of young women.

UPA and mifepristone have higher efficacy as EC compared to ; while there is some suggestion that mifepristone may interfere with implantation, whether UPA has post-ovulatory action in inhibiting implantation is yet to be confirmed.An in vitro experimental study using trophoblastic spheroids made from JAr cell line as the embryo surrogate, and the Ishikawa cell line and primary human endometrial cells cultured to monolayer as the endometrial surrogate. The primary endometrial cells were collected from nine volunteer women in the mid-luteal phase with consent.The study was conducted in a university gynaecology unit. The JAr and Ishikawa cell lines (or primary endometrial cells) were treated with graded concentrations of UPA (0, 0.04, 0.4 and 4 μM) or mifepristone (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 μM) for 24 h. Embryo-endometrial attachment was studied using an in vitro JAr spheroid-endometrial co-culture model. Expressions of progesterone receptor, β-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK-3β) were studied with real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.In the Ishikawa experiments, there was no significant difference in the JAr spheroid attachment rate after treatment with UPA at 0 (93.0%), 0.04 (93.6%), 0.4 (93.4%) and 4 (91.4%) μM concentrations (P > 0.05); the attachment rate was reduced after treatment with mifepristone only at 10 μM (79.8%, P < 0.0001) but not at 0.1 (92.1%) or 1.0 (95.2%) μM concentrations. In the primary endometrial cell experiments, again no significant difference was observed in the JAr spheroid attachment rate after treatment with UPA 4 μM (42.6%) compared to control (46.5%, P > 0.05). Both UPA and mifepristone could significantly up-regulate progesterone receptor expression. There was no significant alteration in expression of β-catenin and GSK-3β after treatment with UPA 4 μM or mifepristone 10 μM (P > 0.05).The co-culture model is only a surrogate which may not fully represent the complicated process of embryo implantation in vivo, although there is no existing perfect model for studying implantation in vitro which fully resembles the latter.The lack of inhibitory effect on embryo implantation by UPA and possibly mifepristone at concentrations corresponding to the EC dose is an important information for contraceptive counseling.We had free supply of the UPA compound used in this study from Laboratoire HRA Pharma.

In this cross-sectional study, the study groups consisted of control group that represented by 30 healthy married women who were not on any contraceptive mean or any hormonal therapy and had normal menstrual cycles, group two consisted of 30 women who were users of Levonorgesterl 0.15 mg plus Ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg as 21 days cycle, group three consisted of 30 women who were users of Gestodene 0.075 mg plus Ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg as 21 days cycle, and group four consisted of 30 women who were users of Drospirenone 3 mg plus Ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg as 21 days cycle. One-way analysis of variance followed by LSD post hoc test was used for comparison of variables. P value <0.05 was considered to be significant. The comparison of the studied groups revealed that COCPs containing  plus ethinylestradiol resulted in significantly lower adiponectin level, and significantly higher leptin and resistin levels with more atherogenic lipid profile presented by significantly higher LDL-C, significantly lower HDL-C concentrations, and significantly higher atherogenic index.

Formulation containing ethinylestradiol combined with drospirenone resulted in significantly higher HDL-C and adiponectin concentrations. In conclusion, the uptake of COCPs containing  plus ethinylestradiol is associated with high cardiovascular risk since this formulation showed significantly lower adiponectin concentration, significantly higher leptin, resistin, and atherogenic index as compared to other studied groups. By contrast, the formulations containing ethinylestradiol combined with third generation progestin gestodene or fourth generation progestin drospirenone are associated with low cardiovascular risk since they neither altered adipose tissue function nor impaired lipoprotein  as experienced by their favorable effect on leptin, adiponectin, and resistin, with non-changed atherogenic index, higher HDL-C levels and lower LDL-C levels as compared to  plus ethinylestradiol formulation.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29553853>Influence of age on tolerability, safety and effectiveness of subdermal contraceptive implants.</a></h2><p>The use of long-acting contraceptive methods is on the rise.

This was a descriptive, retrospective, observational study of 221 cases of contraceptive implants inserted at a Spanish hospital between 2006 and 2015. The mean age of implant users was 31.2 ± 7.5 years. Effectiveness was 100% and good tolerability was recorded for 86.5%. Infrequent bleeding was the most common bleeding pattern, followed by amenorrhoea. Of the 221 implants inserted, 47.5% were removed. The main reasons were expiration (54.3%) and discomfort due to bleeding alterations and other adverse effects (25.7%). Nulliparity and  gain were significantly associated with an increased probability of implant removal. This study shows that implants were highly effective, safe and well-tolerated in our population.

Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in English from January 1994 to January 2015. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to June 2015.

Chapter 1: Contraception in Canada Summary Statements 1. Canadian women spend a significant portion of their lives at risk of an unintended pregnancy. (II-2) 2. Effective contraceptive methods are underutilized in Canada, particularly among vulnerable populations. (II-2) 3. Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, including contraceptive implants and intrauterine contraception (copper-releasing and -releasing devices/systems), are the most effective reversible contraceptive methods and have the highest continuation rates. (II-1) 4. Canada currently does not collect reliable data to determine the use of contraceptive methods, abortion rates, and the prevalence of unintended pregnancy among reproductive-age women. (II-2) 5. A universal subsidy for contraceptive methods as provided by many of Canada's peer nations and a few Canadian provinces may produce health system cost-savings. (II-2) 6. Health Canada approval processes for contraceptives have been less efficient than those of other drug approval agencies and Health Canada processes for other classes of pharmaceuticals. (II-2) 7. It is feasible and safe for contraceptives and family planning services to be provided by appropriately trained allied health professionals such as midwives, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists. (II-2) Recommendations 1. Contraceptive counselling should include a discussion of typical use failure rates and the importance of using the contraceptive method consistently and correctly in order to avoid pregnancy. (II-2A) 2. Women seeking contraception should be counselled on the wide range of effective methods of contraception available, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARCs). LARCs are the most effective methods of reversible contraception, have high continuation rates, and should be considered when presenting contraceptive options to any woman of reproductive age. (II-2A) 3. Family planning counselling should include counselling on the decline of fertility associated with increasing female age. (III-A) 4. Health policy supporting a universal contraception subsidy and strategies to promote the uptake of highly effective methods as cost-saving  that improve health and health equity should be considered by Canadian health decision makers. (III-B) 5. Canadian health jurisdictions should consider expanding the scope of practice of other trained professionals such as nurses, nurse practitioners, midwives, and pharmacists and promoting task-sharing in family planning. (II-2B) 6. The Canadian Community Health Survey should include adequate reproductive health indicators in order for health care providers and policy makers to make appropriate decisions regarding reproductive health policies and services in Canada. (III-B) 7. Health Canada processes and policies should be reviewed to ensure a wide range of modern contraceptive methods are available to Canadian women. (III-B) Chapter 2: Contraceptive Care and Access Summary Statements 8. Although there are many contraceptive options in Canada, only a narrow range of contraceptive methods are commonly used by those of reproductive age. (II-3) 9. Condom use decreases with longer relationship tenure and when the sexual partner is considered to be the main partner, likely due to a lower perceived risk of sexually transmitted infection in that relationship. Condom use may also decrease markedly as an unintended consequence when an effective non-barrier method, such as hormonal contraception or intrauterine contraception, is initiated. (II-3) 10. Family planning counselling provides a natural segue into screening for concerns about sexual function or intimate partner violence. (III) 11. Well-informed and well-motivated individuals who have developed skills to practise safer sex behaviours are more likely to use contraceptive and safer sex methods effectively and consistently. (II-2) Recommendations 8. Comprehensive family planning services, including abortion services, should be accessible to all Canadians regardless of geographic location. These services should be confidential, non-judgemental, and respectful of individuals' privacy and cultural contexts. (III-A) 9. A contraceptive visit should include history taking, screening for contraindications, dispensing or prescribing a method of contraception, and exploring contraceptive choice and adherence in the broader context of the individual's sexual behaviour, reproductive health risk, social circumstances, and relevant belief systems. (III-B) 10. Health care providers should provide practical information on the wide range of contraceptive options and their potential non-contraceptive benefits and assist women and their partners in determining the best user-method fit. (III-B) 11. Health care providers should assist women and men in developing the skills necessary to negotiate the use of contraception and the correct and consistent use of a chosen method. (III-B) 12. Contraceptive care should include discussion and management of the risk of sexually transmitted infection, including appropriate recommendations for condom use and dual protection, STI screening, post-exposure prophylaxis, and Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccination. (III-B) 13. Health care providers should emphasize the use of condoms not only for protection against sexually transmitted infection, but also as a back-up method when adherence to a hormonal contraceptive may be suboptimal. (I-A) 14. Health care providers should be aware of current media controversies in reproductive health and acquire relevant evidence-based information that can be briefly and directly communicated to their patients. (III-B) 15. Referral resources for intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, sexual dysfunction, induced abortion services, and child protection services should be available to help clinicians provide contraceptive care in the broader context of women's health. (III-B) Chapter 3: Emergency Contraception Summary Statements 12. The copper intrauterine device is the most effective method of emergency contraception. (II-2) 13. A copper intrauterine device can be used for emergency contraception up to 7 days after unprotected intercourse provided that pregnancy has been ruled out and there are no other contraindications to its insertion. (II-2) 14.  emergency contraception is effective up to 5 days (120 hours) after intercourse; its effectiveness decreases as the time between unprotected intercourse and ingestion increases. (II-2) 15. Ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is more effective than  emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. This difference in effectiveness is more pronounced as the time from unprotected intercourse increases, especially after 72 hours. (I) 16. Hormonal emergency contraception ( emergency contraception and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception) is not effective if taken on the day of ovulation or after ovulation. (II-2) 17.  emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a  mass index > 25 kg/m2 and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception may be less effective in women with a  mass index > 35 kg/m2. However, hormonal emergency contraception may still retain some effectiveness regardless of a woman's  or  mass index. (II-2) 18. Hormonal emergency contraception is associated with higher failure rates when women continue to have subsequent unprotected intercourse. (II-2) 19. Hormonal contraception can be initiated the day of or the day following the use of  emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 7 days. (III) 20. Hormonal contraception can be initiated 5 days following the use of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception, with back-up contraception used for the first 14 days. (III) Recommendations 16.

Following oral administration, ezetimibe is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised (>80%) to the pharmacologically active ezetimibe-glucuronide. Total ezetimibe (sum of 'parent' ezetimibe plus ezetimibe-glucuronide) concentrations reach a maximum 1-2 hours post-administration, followed by enterohepatic recycling and slow elimination. The estimated terminal half-life of ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide is approximately 22 hours. Consistent with the elimination half-life of ezetimibe, an approximate 2-fold accumulation is observed upon repeated once-daily administration. The recommended dose of ezetimibe 10 mg/day can be administered in the morning or evening without regard to food. There are no clinically significant effects of age, sex or race on ezetimibe pharmacokinetics and no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment or mild-to-severe renal insufficiency. The major metabolic pathway for ezetimibe consists of glucuronidation of the 4-hydroxyphenyl group by uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzymes to form ezetimibe-glucuronide in the intestine and liver. Approximately 78% of the dose is excreted in the faeces predominantly as ezetimibe, with the balance found in the urine mainly as ezetimibe-glucuronide. Overall, ezetimibe has a favourable drug-drug interaction profile, as evidenced by the lack of clinically relevant interactions between ezetimibe and a variety of drugs commonly used in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Ezetimibe does not have significant effects on plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors commonly known as statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin), fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate), digoxin, glipizide, warfarin and triphasic oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and ). Concomitant administration of food, antacids, cimetidine or statins had no significant effect on ezetimibe bioavailability. Although coadministration with gemfibrozil and fenofibrate increased the bioavailability of ezetimibe, the clinical significance is thought to be minor considering the relatively flat dose-response curve of ezetimibe and the lack of dose-related increase in adverse events. In contrast, coadministration with the bile acid binding agent colestyramine significantly decreased ezetimibe oral bioavailability (based on area under the plasma concentration-time curve of total ezetimibe). Hence, ezetimibe and colestyramine should be administered several hours apart to avoid attenuating the efficacy of ezetimibe. Finally, higher ezetimibe exposures were observed in patients receiving concomitant ciclosporin, and ezetimibe caused a small but statistically significant effect on plasma levels of ciclosporin. Because treatment experience in patients receiving ciclosporin is limited, physicians are advised to exercise caution when initiating ezetimibe in the setting of ciclosporin coadministration, and to carefully monitor ciclosporin levels.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10640160>Effects of -releasing subdermal contraceptive implants on bone density and bone metabolism.</a></h2><p>A prospective, randomized clinical trial observed the effects of Norplant long-term contraceptive implants and domestic implants similar to Norplant on bone mineral density and bone metabolism in female acceptors for 1 year.

Almost all synthetic progestogens are devoid of an antimineralocorticoid effect, and are unable to antagonize the salt-retaining effect of estrogens. This property could be one cause of the  gain and increase in blood pressure associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives and, in some susceptible women, with postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This review illustrates the results of clinical studies with drospirenone, a new progestogen with antialdosterone activity. In normally menstruating women, 3 mg drospirenone per day, taken from day 5 to day 25 of the cycle, inhibits ovulation. A combination of 3 mg drospirenone with 30 microg ethinylestradiol (Yasmin, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) is a highly effective and well-tolerated oral contraceptive, with an overall Pearl Index of 0.57 and an adjusted Pearl Index of 0.09. In addition, this combination leads to mild natriuresis and a slight compensatory activation of the renin-aldosterone system. This effect hasbeen clinically demonstrated: compared with an oral contraceptive containing 30 microg ethinylestradiol and 150 microg , 30 microg ethinylestradiol/3 mg drospirenone, given over 6 months, led to slight decreases in  and blood pressure. For postmenopausal HRT, 2 mg drospirenone was combined with 1 mg 17beta-estradiol (Angeliq, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) for continuous treatment. To evaluate the endometrial safety of this combination, data were assessed from 520 postmenopausal women receiving 1 mg 17beta-estradiol and drospirenone (1, 2 or 3 mg per day) for at least 100 weeks. There were no cases of hyperplasia or carcinoma during the entire study period, and 85-92% of women had an atrophic/inactive endometrium. Data from two studies, with a treatment duration of at least 6 months, demonstrated a decrease in mean systolic blood pressure of 1.8 mmHg and a decrease in mean diastolic blood pressure of 3.8 mmHg, after treatment with 1 mg 17beta-estradiol/2 mg drospirenonefor 28 weeks. However, in a subgroup of slightly hypertensive women (initial blood pressure of more than 140/90 mmHg), the mean decrease in systolic blood pressure after 28 weeks of treatment with 1 mg 17beta-estradiol/2 mg drospirenone was 12.5 mmHg, and the mean decrease in diastolic blood pressure was 9.4 mmHg. Since high blood pressure is a cardiovascular risk factor, the use of drospirenone may exert a beneficial effect in this regard. More prolonged studies need to be performed, in order to demonstrate whether negative cardiovascular end-points can be reduced by the new progestogen. In conclusion, drospirenone is not only a safe option for women using oral contraceptives or HRT, but it may offer new medical benefits, via its antimineralocorticoid and antialdosterone effects and its potential to decrease water retention and blood pressure.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17224852>-releasing intrauterine system as an adjunct to estrogen for the treatment of menopausal symptoms--a review.</a></h2><p>Exogenous estrogen is an effective means of prevention for postmenopausal symptoms. Estrogen treatment should be combined with progesterone in non-hysterectomized women to prevent estrogen-induced malignant transformation of the endometrium. Progesterone supplementation using continuous combined estrogen + progesterone treatment may result in an increased incidence of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. In addition, progesterone supplementation with sequential estrogen + progesterone treatment may cause immediate adverse effects, such as irregular bleeding and spotting, breast congestion, fluid retention, abdominal distention, and a change in  profile. All these effects are related, at least in part, to the progesterone component of the therapy.To avoid these complications, researchers are seeking safer progestational components and different modes of administration.

Implants are one of the most effective and reversible methods of contraception available. These devices may be particularly appropriate for certain populations of women, including women who cannot use estrogen-containing contraception. Implants are safe for use by women with many chronic medical problems. The newest implant, Implanon (Organon International, Oss, The Netherlands), is the only device currently available in the United States and was approved in 2006. It is registered for 3 years of pregnancy prevention. Contraceptive implants have failure rates similar to tubal ligation, and yet they are readily reversible with a return to fertility within days of removal. Moreover, these contraceptive devices can be safely placed in the immediate postpartum period, ensuring good contraceptive coverage for women who may be at risk for an unintended pregnancy. Irregular bleeding is a common side effect for all progestin-only contraceptive implants. Preinsertion counseling should address possible side effects, and treatment may be offered to women who experience prolonged or frequent bleeding.Thieme Medical Publishers.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28712591>Normalizing Ovulation Rate by Preferential Reduction of Hepato-Visceral Fat in Adolescent Girls With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an increasingly prevalent disorder in adolescent girls, commonly presenting with hirsutism/oligomenorrhea, commonly treated with an oral contraceptive (OC), and commonly followed by oligoanovulatory subfertility. We tested whether an intervention targeting the reduction of hepato-visceral adiposity is followed by a higher ovulation rate than OC treatment.This randomized, open-label, single-center, pilot proof-of-concept study (12 months on treatment, then 12 months off) was performed in adolescent girls with hirsutism and oligomenorrhea (PCOS by National Institutes of Health; no sexual activity; N = 36; mean age 16 years,  mass index 23.5 kg/m; 94% study completion). Compared treatments were OC (ethinylestradiol-) versus low-dose combination of spironolactone 50 mg/d, pioglitazone 7.5 mg/d, and metformin 850 mg/d (SPIOMET). Primary outcome was post-treatment ovulation rate inferred from menstrual diaries and salivary progesterone (12 + 12 weeks). Secondary outcomes included  composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry), abdominal fat (magnetic resonance imaging), insulinemia (oral glucose tolerance test), and androgenemia (liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry).SPIOMET was followed by a 2.5-fold higher ovulation rate than OC (p ≤ .001) and by a 6-fold higher normovulatory fraction (71% vs. 12%; p ≤ .001); oligoanovulation risk after SPIOMET was 65% lower (95% confidence interval, 40%-89%) than after OC. Higher post-treatment ovulation rates related to more on-treatment loss of hepatic fat (r = .27; p < .005). Visceral fat and insulinemia normalized only with SPIOMET; androgenemia normalized faster with OC but rebounded more thereafter. , lean mass, and abdominal subcutaneous fat mass remained stable in both groups.Early SPIOMET treatment for PCOS normalized post-treatment ovulation rates more than OC.

We quantified: glycosidase levels; sialic acid and high mannose specific lectin binding; mucins, MUC1, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC7; and albumin in the samples collected. These data were analyzed in the context of hormonal status (day of menstrual cycle, hormonal contraception use) and role, if any, of the type of the vaginal microflora present. When the Nugent score was used to stratify the subjects by microflora as normal, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis, several important differences were observed. The activities of four of six glycosidases in the samples from women with bacterial vaginosis were significantly increased when compared to normal or intermediate women: sialidase, P = <0.001; α-galactosidase, P = 0.006; β-galactosidase, P = 0.005; α-glucosidase, P = 0.056. Sialic acid binding sites as measured by two lectins, Maackia amurensis and Sambucus nigra binding, were significantly lower in women with BV compared to women with normal and intermediate scores (P = <0.0001 and 0.008 respectively). High mannose binding sites, a measure of innate immunity were also significantly lower in women with BV (P = <0.001). Additionally, we observed significant increases in MUC1, MUC4, MUC5AC, and MUC7 concentrations in women with BV (P = <0.001, 0.001, <0.001, 0.02 respectively). Among normal women we found that the membrane bound mucin MUC4 and the secreted MUC5AC were decreased in postmenopausal women (P = 0.02 and 0.07 respectively), while MUC7 (secreted) was decreased in women using -containing IUDs (P = 0.02). The number of sialic acid binding sites was lower in the postmenopausal group (P = 0.04), but the number of high mannose binding sites, measured with Griffithsin, was not significantly different among the 6 hormonal groups. The glycosidase levels in the cervical-vaginal mucus were rather low in the groups, with exception of α-glucosidase activity that was much lower in the postmenopausal group (P<0.001). These studies present compelling evidence that the vaginal ecosystem responds to the presence of different vaginal microorganisms. These effects were so influential that it required us to remove subjects with BV for data interpretation of the impact of hormones. We also suggest that certain changes occurring in vaginal/cervical proteins are due to bacteria or their products. Therefore, the quantitation of vaginal mucins and lectin binding offers a new method to monitor bacteria-host interactions in the female reproductive tract. The data suggest that some of the changes in these components are the result of host processing, such as the increases in mucin content, while the microflora is responsible for the increases in glycosidases and the decreases in lectin binding. The methods should be considered a valid marker for insult to the female genital tract.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26848851>Non-hormonal and hormonal intrauterine contraception: survey of patients' perceptions in four Latin American countries.</a></h2><p>This study sought to understand women's perceived barriers to the use of hormonal and non-hormonal intrauterine contraception in Latin America.We developed an online survey for women in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico who were seeking contraception. The questions aimed at evaluating patient awareness of negative stories and statements, as well as perceived barriers to the copper intrauterine device (IUD) and the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS).The survey was mailed to 2300 women. A total of 1953 responses were received from Argentina (n = 465), Brazil (n = 380), Colombia (n = 613) and Mexico (n = 495). More women reported having heard negative stories about the copper IUD than about the LNG-IUS. More women believed that the copper IUD, rather than the LNG-IUS, was suitable only for those who had already had children. More women believed that  gain (14.3% vs. 38.2%; p < 0.001), mood swings (14.1% vs. 38.7%; p < 0.001) and infertility (16.3% vs. 19.9%; p = 0.016) were possible side effects of the LNG-IUS. By contrast, more women believed that abortion (36% vs. 22.7%; p < 0.001), pelvic infections (42.1% vs. 15.7%; p < 0.001) and ectopic pregnancy (43.5% vs 23.5%; p < 0.001) were side effects more associated with the copper IUD.

In initial in vitro studies herein, we found LNG significantly impaired activation of human dendritic cell (DCs) and their capacity to promote allogeneic T cell proliferation. In follow-up studies in a murine model of intranasal Chlamydia trachomatis infection, we analogously found that LNG treatment prior to infection dramatically reduced CD40 expression in DCs isolated from draining lymph nodes at 2 days post infection (dpi). At 12 dpi, we also detected significantly fewer CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lungs of LNG-treated mice. This inhibition of DC activation and T cell expansion in LNG-treated mice also delayed chlamydial clearance and the resolution of pulmonary . Conversely, administering agonist anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody to LNG-treated mice at 1 dpi restored lung T cell numbers and chlamydial burden at 12 dpi to levels seen in infected controls. Together, these studies reveal that LNG suppresses DC activation and function, and inhibits formation of pathogen-specific T cell immunity.

This study assessed the impact of the LNG-IUS on development of Chlamydia trachomatis pelvic inflammatory disease, using a baboon model.Baboons with and those without the LNG-IUS were cervically inoculated with C. trachomatis and monitored daily, and cervical and fallopian tube swab specimens were collected weekly for C. trachomatis quantitation by nucleic acid amplification testing and culture. Vaginal swab specimens were collected for cytokine analysis, and serum samples were obtained for detection of C. trachomatis antibodies.The LNG-IUS resulted in an increased C. trachomatis burden in the cervix, with the bacterial burden in the LNG-IUS group diverging from that in the non-LNG-IUS group by 6 weeks after infection. One of 7 baboons in the non-LNG-IUS group and 2 of 6 in the LNG-IUS group developed pelvic inflammatory disease, while 3 animals in each group met criteria suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease. LNG-IUS increased baseline interleukin 8 levels but failed to further upregulate interleukin 8 during infection. In LNG-IUS recipients, early perturbations in the interleukin 1β axis corresponded to decreased C. trachomatis clearance and increased T-helper type 2 immune responses.LNG-IUS use results in delayed clearance of C. trachomatis and might alter the reproductive tract immune environment.© The Author(s) 2017.

In the GZ goats, the g.1384G>A mutation was identified in the promoter of the goat KISS1 gene. Guanzhong goats were in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium at g.1384G>A locus (P<0.05). The 1384A allele was predicted to eliminate methylation, AHR-arnt heterodimers and AHR-related factors (AHRR) and myoblast determining factors (MYOD) transcription factor-binding sites. Statistical results indicated that the g.1384G>A SNP was associated with litter size in the GZ goats (P<0.05). Luciferase assay analysis suggested that the 1384A allele increased luciferase activity when compared to the 1384G allele.

While estrogens and androgens were previously demonstrated to impact organisms during environmental exposures, progestagens have recently been shown to have strong impacts on aquatic organisms. To gain an understanding of the impacts of these types of chemicals on aquatic species, experiments evaluating the mechanisms of action of progestagen exposure were conducted with the Eastern Mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). The objective of this study was to conduct hepatic microarray analysis of male and female G. holbrooki exposed to progestins and anti-progestagens. In addition, we evaluated the ability of , a synthetic progesterone (progestin), to induce anal fin elongation and to determine how anal fin growth is modulated during co-exposures with progesterone and androgen receptor antagonists. Gene expression analyses were conducted on male and female G. holbrooki exposed for 48h to the agonist , the antagonist mifepristone, or a mixture of the two chemicals. Microarray analysis revealed that mifepristone does not act as an anti-progestagen in G. holbrooki in liver tissues, and that  elicits strong effects on the processes of embryo development and lipid transport.  was also demonstrated to induce male secondary sexual characteristic formation in females, and co-exposure of either an androgen or  in the presence of the anti-androgen flutamide prevented anal fin elongation. These results provide indications as to the potential impacts of progestins, including non-target effects such as secondary sexual characteristic formation, and demonstrate the importance of this class of chemicals on aquatic organisms.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, most of the previously reported gold nanocluster radiosensitizers do not have a precise atomic structure, causing difficulties in understanding the structure-activity relationship. In this study, a structurally defined gold- nanocluster consisting of Au(CHO) (AuNC) with bright luminescence (58.7% quantum yield) and satisfactory biocompatibility was demonstrated as a nanoradiosensitizer. When the AuNCs were irradiated with X-rays, they produced reactive  species (ROS), resulting in irreversible cell apoptosis. As indicated by  tumor formation experiments, tumorigenicity was significantly suppressed after one radiotherapy treatment with the AuNCs. In addition, compared with tumors treated with X-rays (4 Gy) alone, tumors treated with the nanosensitizer exhibited an inhibition rate of 74.2%.

Bioinformatic analysis of selected published microarray datasets identified differentially regulated genes for the early and mid-secretory phases relative to the proliferative phase. Diseases and Functions categories were identified with Ingenuity (IPA) 'core analysis' software. The key transcription factors controlling secretory phase gene changes were revealed with oPOSSUM software. FOXD3 expression levels were examined in human endometrial samples from women aged 18-55 years by WB, IHC, and qPCR. The progesterone regulation of endometrial FOXD3 levels was examined in vivo and in cultured primary human endometrial stromal cells in vitro.Initial data mining and subsequent bioinformatics analysis of human endometrial microarray datasets identified FOXD3 to be a key regulator of gene expression specific to secretory phase/endometriosis. FOXD3 was dynamically expressed in healthy endometrium and differentially expressed in endometriosis. In vitro decidualisation of primary endometrial stromal cells significantly decreased FOXD3 protein (P = 0.0005) and progestagen () treatment also reduced the high endometrial FOXD3 protein (P = 0.0001) and mRNA levels (P = 0.04) seen in untreated women with endometriosis, with a shift of FOXD3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.The quality of Bioinformatics analysis and results depends on the published micro-array data.An in depth analysis of FOXD3 function and its relationship with estrogen and progesterone might provide insights into its potential deregulation in proliferative disorders of the endometrium including endometrial cancer where its expression is also deregulated.

Investigations were performed at the end of each diet during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.Blood pressure was measured by 24 h ambulatory recording; cardiovascular reactivity was determined by examining blood pressure responses to systemic infusions of noradrenaline and angiotensin II and to the cold pressor test; and carbohydrate  was investigated by an intravenous glucose-tolerance test.Plasma triglyceride levels were significantly higher in women taking oral contraceptive pills compared with non-users on both diets; however, responses of lipoprotein levels to the two diets did not differ between study groups (total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by 15 and 17% in oral contraceptive pill users and by 14% each in non-users, on the low- compared with the high- diet). Fasting plasma insulin levels, the insulin-production response to administration of glucose (insulin area under the curve) and resting clinic and night-time systolic blood pressures were all significantly reduced on the low- diet, but only in non-users. Blood pressure responses to noradrenaline and maximal heart rate response to cold were significantly attenuated during the low- diet in oral contraceptive pill users. During the low- diet, resting systolic, 24 h systolic and diastolic blood pressures and insulin area under the curve were all significantly higher for women taking the oral contraceptive pills. Users of these pills also exhibited a greater systolic sensitivity to administration both of noradrenaline and of angiotensin II and had a higher plasma renin activity irrespective of dietary phase.These results confirm that oral contraceptive pills have the potential to cause adverse effects on blood pressure, cardiovascular reactivity and the insulin-production response to administration of glucose and suggest that some of the beneficial effects of a low- diet on these parameters may be negated in women taking oral contraceptive pills.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3219852>A multicentre comparative study of serum lipids and lipoproteins in four groups of oral combined contraceptive users and a control group of IUD users.

Unpaired t test and Chi-square test were used for comparison of variables between oral contraceptive users and non-oral contraceptive users.Serum adiponectin and leptin levels were changed in COC consumers. The data obtained for adiponectin in COC consumers (6.6 ± 4.06 μg/ml) were significantly lower (-27.4%, P = 0.004) than control group (9.1 ± 5.09 μg/ml).

The age of COC consumption and the duration of intake of COCs beyond 36 months had no significant effect on the adiponectin and leptin concentrations.LD COC uptake results in a significant decrease in serum adiponectin concentration, nonsignificant increase in leptin levels and a more atherogenic lipid profile by significantly increasing LDL and nonsignificantly decreasing HDL concentrations. These findings suggested that COC may reduce or stimulate the adiponectin and leptin concentrations, respectively. This might be due to an effect of these pills on adipocyte maturation via inhibition or stimulation of the synthesis of new adiponectin and leptin molecules or may be a result of the increased frequency of a particular allele of the adiponectin and leptin. It is suggested that these alterations in adiponectin and leptin concentrations and lipid profiles may be related to their probable effects in response to various pathological and physiological properties of COC or its metabolites. It seems that probably free radicals produced during  of COCs change the amounts of adipokines and atherogenic lipids.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28824796>Prenatal  exposure induces autism-like behavior in offspring through ERβ suppression in the amygdala.</a></h2><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairments in social communication and restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests. ASD is now diagnosed in more than one out of 100 children and is biased towards males by a ratio of at least 4:1. Many possible explanations and potential causative factors have been reported, such as genetics, sex, and environmental factors, although the detailed mechanisms of ASD remain unclear.The dams were exposed through oral contraceptives to either vehicle control (VEH) alone,  (LNG) alone, ethinyl estradiol (EE) alone, or a combination of LNG/EE for 21 days during their pregnancy. The subsequent 10-week-old offspring were used for autism-like behavior testing, and the limbic tissues were isolated for analysis. In another experimental group, 8-week-old male offspring were treated by infusion of ERβ overexpression/knockdown lentivirus in the amygdala, and the offspring were analyzed after 2 weeks.We show that prenatal exposure of either LNG alone or a LNG/EE combination, but not EE alone, results in suppression of ERβ (estrogen receptor β) and its target genes in the amygdala with autism-like behavior in male offspring, while there is a much smaller effect on female offspring. However, we find that there is no effect on the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Further investigation shows that ERβ suppression is due to LNG-mediated altered methylation on the ERβ promoter and results in tissue damage with oxidative stress and the dysfunction of  and fatty acid metabolism, which subsequently triggers autism-like behavior. Overexpression of ERβ in the amygdala completely restores LNG-induced ERβ suppression and autism-like behaviors in offspring, while ERβ knockdown mimics this effect, indicating that ERβ expression in the amygdala plays an important role in autism-like behavior development.We conclude that prenatal  exposure induces autism-like behavior in offspring through ERβ suppression in the amygdala.

In vitro data suggest that NETU inhibits CYP3A4 and is a substrate for and weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This review evaluates potential drug-drug interactions between NETU or NEPA and CYP3A4 substrates/inducers/inhibitors or P-gp substrates in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated for each drug when NETU was coadministered with PALO (single doses) and when single doses of NETU or NEPA were coadministered with CYP3A4 substrates (erythromycin (ERY), midazolam (MID), dexamethasone (DEX), or oral contraceptives), inhibitors (ketoconazole (KETO)), or inducers (rifampicin (RIF)), or a P-gp substrate (digoxin (DIG)). Results showed no relevant PK interactions between NETU and PALO. Coadministration of NETU increased MID and ERY exposure and significantly increased DEX exposure in a dose-dependent manner; NETU exposure was unaffected. NEPA coadministration had no clinically significant effect on oral contraception, although  exposure increased. NETU exposure increased after coadministration of NEPA with KETO and decreased after coadministration with RIF; PALO exposure was unaffected. NETU coadministration did not influence DIG exposure.

Changes in carbohydrate metabolism occurred as early as 1 month but were most marked after 6 months. After 1 month the area under the glucose and insulin curves increased by 12.3% and 37.7%, respectively. This increase was more marked by 6 months, but by 12 months it was significantly less marked. Although changes in the blood glucose and plasma insulin levels at different times during the oral glucose tolerance test occurred, they were all within normal limits for normal women. The peak blood glucose and insulin levels after insertion of the implant occurred 60 minutes after the glucose load, as opposed to 30 minutes before insertion. Apart from this, there was a significant delay in the return of these levels to fasting values. We conclude that this product, like any other progesterone-containing contraceptive, alters carbohydrate metabolism, but these alterations are not clinically significant in normal women.

Glycosylation of CVF proteins, such as mucins, IgG and S-IgA, plays a critical role in their immunological functions. Although multiple factors, such as hormones and microflora, may influence glycosylation of the CVF, few studies have examined their impact on this important immunological fluid. Herein we analyzed the glycosylation of cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples collected from 165 women under different hormonal conditions including: (1) no contraceptive, post-menopausal, (2) no contraceptive, days 1-14 of the menstrual cycle, (3) no contraceptive, days 15-28 of the menstrual cycle, (4) combined-oral contraceptive pills for at least 6 months, (5) depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) injections for at least 6 months, (6)  IUD for at least 1 month. Glycomic profiling was obtained using our lectin microarray system, a rapid method to analyze carbohydrate composition. Although some small effects were observed due to hormone levels, the major influence on the glycome was the presence of an altered bacterial cohort due to bacterial vaginosis (BV). Compared to normal women, samples from women with BV contained lower levels of sialic acid and high-mannose glycans in their CVL. The change in high mannose levels was unexpected and may be related to the increased risk of HIV-infection observed in women with BV, as high mannose receptors are a viral entry pathway. Changes in the glycome were also observed with hormonal contraceptive use, in a contraceptive-dependent manner. Overall, microflora had a greater impact on the glycome than hormonal levels, and both of these effects should be more closely examined in future studies given the importance of glycans in the innate immune system.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'metabolism', 'microbiome', 'microbiota']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27556454>The Effects of Female Sexual Hormones on the Expression of Aquaporin 5 in the Late-Pregnant Rat Uterus.</a></h2><p>Thirteen mammalian aquaporin (AQP) water channels are known, and few of them play a role in the mammalian reproductive system. In our earlier study, the predominance of AQP5 in the late-pregnant rat uterus was proven. Our current aim was to investigate the effect of estrogen- and gestagen-related compounds on the expression of the AQP5 channel in the late-pregnant rat uterus. Furthermore, we examined the effect of hormonally-induced preterm delivery on the expression of AQP5 in the uterus. We treated pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats subcutaneously with 17β-estradiol, clomiphene citrate, tamoxifen citrate, progesterone, , and medroxyprogesterone acetate. Preterm delivery was induced by subcutaneous mifepristone and intravaginal prostaglandin E2. Reverse-transcriptase PCR and Western blot techniques were used for the detection of the changes in AQP5 mRNA and protein expressions. The amount of AQP5 significantly increased after progesterone and progesterone analogs treatment on 18 and 22 days of pregnancy. The 17β-estradiol and estrogen receptor agonists did not influence the AQP5 mRNA level; however, estradiol induced a significant increase in the AQP5 protein level on the investigated days of gestation. Tamoxifen increased the AQP5 protein expression on day 18, while clomiphene citrate was ineffective. The hormonally-induced preterm birth significantly decreased the AQP5 level similarly to the day of delivery. We proved that AQP5 expression is influenced by both estrogen and progesterone in the late-pregnant rat uterus. The influence of progesterone on AQP5 expression is more predominant as compared with estrogen.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25832444>Reduced prevalence of chronic tubal inflammation in tubal pregnancies after  emergency contraception failure.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to compare chronic fallopian tubal inflammatory disease and fibrosis between patients with general tubal pregnancy (TP) and TP with  (LNG) emergency contraception (EC) failure.We retrospectively studied patients with general TP (n = 79) and TP following LNG-EC failure (n = 81) within the same conception cycle.

After a 1-month dietary challenge, monkeys were randomized into three groups stratified by total plasma cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. The monkeys were then fed a cholesterol-containing diet for 16 weeks. This relatively short period ensured that studies were done before any treatment-induced differences in arterial morphology occurred. Monkeys were treated with either diet alone (control group), with the addition of a monophasic oral contraceptive (equivalent to a human dose of 50 micrograms ethinyl estradiol and 500 micrograms norgestrel per day), or with a triphasic oral contraceptive (equivalent to a human dose of 30-40 micrograms ethinyl estradiol and 50-125 micrograms  per day). Twenty-four hours before necropsy, low density lipoproteins (LDLs) labeled with 131I and LDLs labeled with the residualizing label 125I-tyramine cellobiose were injected into the animals. The arterial LDL degradation rate, amount of undegraded LDLs, and total LDL accumulation were then determined. Although there were regional differences in LDL , both treatments decreased the rate of LDL degradation and LDL accumulation in the coronary arteries and other arterial sites. Treatment also resulted in significantly lower LDL molecular weights. Despite a trend toward a more atherogenic  profile (decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased total plasma/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio), oral contraceptive treatment may inhibit atherogenesis by decreasing arterial LDL degradation.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18548383> antagonism on estrogen-induced pituitary tumors is mediated by progesterone receptors.</a></h2><p>Using both IN VITRO and IN VIVO approaches, we studied the antagonism exerted by the synthetic progestin  on estrogen-induced prolactinomas, considering that  shows partial androgenic properties and that androgens inhibit estrogen-induced prolactin synthesis and secretion.

This difference in androgenicity may be responsible for observed differences in metabolic effects between oral contraceptive (OC) formulations containing almost equivalent estrogen doses but with either DSG or LNG as a progestogen. To test the hypothesis, a prospective 9-month randomized comparison of plasma lipids, glucose, insulin, hemostasis, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was conducted in 66 healthy women using phasic formulations of OCs containing either DSG (DSG-OC) or LNG (LNG-OC). The study results showed that SHBG increased 3-fold with DSG-OC and 2-fold with LNG-OC. DSG-OC increased HDL-C, HDL(2)-C and HDL(3)-C; LDL-C decreased transiently. LNG-OC decreased HDL(2)-C and increased HDL(3)-C; HDL-C was unchanged and LDL-C decreased transiently. Both formulations increased VLDL-C and triglycerides, more with DSG-OC, but apolipoprotein B levels increased equally. Apo A-I and A-II increased more with DSG-OC than with LNG-OC. Neither formulation altered Lp(a) or fasting glucose and insulin levels. Postprandially, both formulations decreased glucose and increased insulin responses, but to an equivalent degree. Both OCs slightly enhanced procoagulant and profibrinolytic parameters to the same extent except for internally compensating decreases in Factor V and protein S with DSG-OC. In summary, at almost equivalent estrogen doses, a phasic OC containing DSG compared with LNG has a less androgenic effect on lipoproteins and SHBG, similar effects on hemostatic parameters with lower protein S and factor V activity and equivalent effects on carbohydrate . The lipoprotein, SHBG, and protein S and factor V differences are likely due to the lesser androgenicity of DSG allowing for a greater expression of the dose of estrogen.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903201>Involvement of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in lipid accumulation and depressed G6PD activity in the livers of rats treated with postpartum oral estrogen-progestin.</a></h2><p>Postpartum contraception is an important step for preventing closely spaced pregnancy. Combined oral contraceptive (COC) has been linked to cardiometabolic disturbances. We therefore hypothesized that postpartum oral estrogen-progestin use induces hepatic lipid accumulation that is associated with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation via adenosine deaminase (ADA)/xanthine oxidase (XO)/uric acid (UA)-dependent pathway. Female Wistar rats weighing 130-150 g were mated to achieve timed pregnancy and delivery. Twenty-four (24) dams were randomly assigned to receive vehicle (po), COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ; po), COC with GR blockade (mifepristone; 80.0 mg/kg; po) and COC with MR blockade (spironolactone; 0.25 mg/kg; po) daily between 3rd and 11th week postpartum. Data showed that postpartum COC resulted in glucose dysregulation, increased visceral adiposity, liver , plasma corticosterone, aldosterone, circulating and hepatic free fatty acid (FFA), triglyceride (TG), adenosine deaminase (ADA), uric acid production, lactate production, and oxidative marker injury. On the other hand, G6PD-dependent antioxidant defenses were depressed by postpartum COC. However, these effects were attenuated by GR or MR blockade. Our data demonstrate that enhanced G6PD-dependent antioxidant defenses and suppressed ADA/XO/UA pathway in the liver by GR or MR blockade improves glucose dysregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by postpartum COC. This study implies a plausible involvement of GR and MR via defective G6PD-dependent antioxidant barrier and increased activity of ADA/XO/UA pathway in postpartum COC-induced hepatic lipid accumulation.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'fatty liver', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709282>[Portal vein thrombosis associated with an acute cytomegalovirus infection].</a></h2><p>Portal vein thrombosis is an unusual condition and its association with an acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is known but rarely reported.

Besides a second generation oral contraceptive with estrogen and progesterone, not associated with smoking, the acute CMV infection was the only cause found to have provoked the venous thrombosis; a myeloproliferative disorder or biological thrombophilia were ruled out. The patient rapidly recovered with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) anticoagulant treatment. Eighteen cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis complicating acute CMV infection were found in the literature. All patients had acute hepatitis. The outcome was usually favorable with warfarin therapy for a period lasting 3 to 7 months. Antiviral treatment (anti-CMV) was used in three cases of severe infection. The antiviral therapy was given only in immunosuppressed patients. For immunocompetent patients, CMV infection is usually asymptomatic and clinical signs are often non-specific and mild, not requiring treatment.This case report and the review of the literature recall the need to search for acute CMV infection in patients with portal thrombosis so a possible transient trigger for venous thromboembolism can be identified, avoiding extended anticoagulation.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

SFP Guideline #20121.</a></h2><p>As a result of advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment, young women within the reproductive-aged group are now more likely to survive cancer. Reproductive-aged women with cancer may be interested in deferring pregnancy either temporarily or permanently at cancer diagnosis, during therapy or after treatment. Currently, there are limited guidelines to aide clinicians in managing the contraceptive needs in this special population. After reviewing the evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of available methods of contraception for women who have been diagnosed with cancer, the Society of Family Planning recommends that women of childbearing age who are being treated for cancer avoid combined hormonal contraceptive methods (containing estrogen and progestin) when possible because they may further increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (Level A). The copper T380A intrauterine device, a highly effective, reversible, long-acting, hormone-free method, should be considered the first-line contraceptive option for women with a history of breast cancer (Level A), although for women being treated with tamoxifen, the -containing intrauterine system (IUS) which decreases endometrial proliferation may be preferable (Level B). Women who develop anemia may benefit from use of a progestin-containing contraceptive (Level A). Women who develop osteopenia or osteoporosis following chemotherapy should avoid the progestin-only contraceptive injection (Level B). More information is needed in many areas. There are insufficient data to evaluate the risk of VTE when progestin-only contraceptives are used by women at high risk of VTE. Information is also needed on whether the -containing IUS affects the risk of breast cancer recurrence and whether hormonal contraceptives affect the risk of breast cancer among women who have received chest wall, or "mantle field," radiation. Finally, studies of the safety and effectiveness of IUS use by women who are immunosuppressed and studies of whether progestin-only contraceptives affect the risk of fracture among cancer survivors or, more generally, women with osteopenia would be useful.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Venous thromboembolism remains one event that can occur in users independent of the presence of risk factors. However, the attributable risk is small, with a range of approximately 7 to 18 events per 100 000 women annually. This risk is directly proportional to estrogen dosage starting at levels of 30-35 microg. The type of progestogen (progestin) may also influence risk, though recent studies are controversial. In particular, there is debate surrounding whether desogestrel and gestodene carry a greater risk of thromboembolism than .

Two hundred and seven intact cynomolgus monkeys were randomized to two groups, and fed an atherogenic diet containing either no drug (Control) or a triphasic oral contraceptive regimen (Contraceptive). Measurements of bone density were carried out by dual- X-ray absorptiometry at 10-month intervals (0, 10, and 20 months) and serum bone biomarkers were determined at 5-month intervals over the 20-month time course. No significant differences in these variables were observed prior to treatment. Both groups of animals gained bone mineral during the study, indicating that peak bone mass had not been reached at baseline. Contraceptive-treated animals gained less spinal (lumbar vertebrae 2-4) bone mineral content and density and less whole-body bone mineral content than Controls over the course of the study. Significant depressive effects of contraceptive treatment on gains in BMC and BMD were observed during each 10-month interval of the study. Bone metabolism was inhibited in the Contraceptive group, as reflected by marked reductions (approximately 40%) in serum osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase levels along with moderate reductions in serum acid phosphatase and calcium. The results suggest that triphasic oral contraceptive treatment of young adult female monkeys that have not reached peak bone mass inhibits net bone accretion and/or growth by reducing bone metabolism. Thus, prolonged continuous oral contraceptive use in skeletally immature females may lead to a lower peak bone mass--an effect which could increase the risk of fractures in later life.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12934314>[Methods of hormone replacement therapy in hypertensive women].</a></h2><p>A comparative retrospective study was made to examine influence of replacement therapy by estradiol valeriate and climonorm on perimenopausal hypertension.

To investigate the effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy on atherogenesis, we studied 75 cholesterol-fed female rabbits for 19 wk. The rabbits were randomly assigned to five groups.

The fifth group had a sham operation and received placebo. The hormone groups had only one-third of the aortic accumulation of cholesterol found in the placebo groups, a difference that was highly statistically significant (P less than 0.0001). No significant differences in aortic accumulation of cholesterol were found in the hormone groups. This indicates that estrogen attenuates atherogenesis in cholesterol-fed ovariectomized rabbits and that two commonly prescribed progestogens do not counteract the effect. The beneficial effect of estradiol could only partly be explained by its lowering effects on serum total cholesterol or VLDL cholesterol, which implies that estradiol possesses additional beneficial effects, possibly a direct action on the arterial wall.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27537097>Hormonal contraceptives for contraception in overweight or obese women.</a></h2><p>Obesity has reached epidemic proportions around the world. Effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be related to metabolic changes in obesity or to greater  mass or  fat. Hormonal contraceptives include oral contraceptives (OCs), injectables, implants, hormonal intrauterine contraception (IUC), the transdermal patch, and the vaginal ring. Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity, the public health impact of any effect on contraceptive efficacy could be substantial.To examine the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives in preventing pregnancy among women who are overweight or obese versus women with a lower  mass index (BMI) or .Until 4 August 2016, we searched for studies in PubMed (MEDLINE), CENTRAL, POPLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. We examined reference lists of pertinent articles to identify other studies. For the initial review, we wrote to investigators to find additional published or unpublished studies.All study designs were eligible. The study could have examined any type of hormonal contraceptive. Reports had to contain information on the specific contraceptive methods used. The primary outcome was pregnancy. Overweight or obese women must have been identified by an analysis cutoff for  or BMI (kg/m(2)).Two authors independently extracted the data. One entered the data into RevMan and a second verified accuracy. The main comparisons were between overweight or obese women and women of lower  or BMI. We examined the quality of evidence using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Where available, we included life-table rates. We also used unadjusted pregnancy rates, relative risk (RR), or rate ratio when those were the only results provided. For dichotomous variables, we computed an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI).With 8 studies added in this update, 17 met our inclusion criteria and had a total of 63,813 women. We focus here on 12 studies that provided high, moderate, or low quality evidence. Most did not show a higher pregnancy risk among overweight or obese women. Of five COC studies, two found BMI to be associated with pregnancy but in different directions. With an OC containing norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (EE), pregnancy risk was higher for overweight women, i.e. with BMI ≥ 25 versus those with BMI < 25 (reported relative risk 2.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 6.13). In contrast, a trial using an OC with  and EE reported a Pearl Index of 0 for obese women (BMI ≥ 30) versus 5.59 for nonobese women (BMI < 30). The same trial tested a transdermal patch containing  and EE. Within the patch group, obese women in the "treatment-compliant" subgroup had a higher reported Pearl Index than nonobese women (4.63 versus 2.15). Of five implant studies, two that examined the six-capsule  implant showed differences in pregnancy by . One study showed higher  was associated with higher pregnancy rate in years 6 and 7 combined (reported P < 0.05). In the other, pregnancy rates differed in year 5 among the lower  groups only (reported P < 0.01) and did not involve women weighing 70 kg or more.Analysis of data from other contraceptive methods indicated no association of pregnancy with overweight or obesity. These included depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (subcutaneous),  IUC, the two-rod  implant, and the etonogestrel implant.The evidence generally did not indicate an association between higher BMI or  and effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. However, we found few studies for most contraceptive methods. Studies using BMI, rather than  alone, can provide information about whether  composition is related to contraceptive effectiveness. The contraceptive methods examined here are among the most effective when used according to the recommended regimen.We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low for the objectives of this review. More recent reports provided evidence of varying quality, while the quality was generally low for older studies. For many trials the quality would be higher for their original purpose rather than the non-randomized comparisons here. Investigators should consider adjusting for potential confounding related to BMI or contraceptive effectiveness. Newer studies included a greater proportion of overweight or obese women, which helps in examining effectiveness and side effects of hormonal contraceptives within those groups.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17717130>Development of a novel immunoassay for the assessment of plasma Gas6 concentrations and their variation with hormonal status.</a></h2><p>Gas6 is a vitamin K-dependent antiapoptotic protein that has been implicated in cardiovascular pathophysiology.

We counseled all women delivered and planning birth-space and breastfeed for at least 1 year for participation during postpartum hospital stay. Eligible participants for inclusion in the randomized controlled trial () were allocated to receive adequate Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) counseling (LAM-only group) or the LAM counseling in addition to counseling about LNG-ECPs use (LAM + emergency contraception (EC) group). These pills were to be used once if unprotected intercourse did occur after expiry of any of the LAM prerequisites and before the couples started to use a reliable method of contraception.

In recent studies in which the sub-50 micrograms ethinyl estrodiol containing pills were investigated comparing current users with non-users, the RR is 3.8 for non-fatal deep VTE and 2.7 for superficial VTE, deep VTE and pulmonary embolism (PE) together and 2.1 for fatal VT and PE together. The association is attributed to the estrogenic component and not related to duration of pill use. The risk disappears once the pill has been stopped, and it is not elevated among past users. Smoking does not appear to be risk factor for VTE;  and varicose veins are, at the most, weak risk factors. Since a causal relationship between OC use and VTE is tempting, clues for unraveling the mechanism were sought in the hemostatic system. Studies of the coagulation system found changes in the activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic compartments, but within the normal range. An epidemiologic study showed that the risk of VTE among women using OCs is 30-fold increased by the presence of a mutation of factor V, called Factor V Leiden (5% prevalence in the Caucasian population). Selective screening for the mutated factor V should be limited to women with a personal or family history of VTE. Four epidemiologic studies showed a two-fold increase in risk of VTE with the use of OCs containing third-generation progestins (gestodene and desogestrel), relative to second-generations products (). Biases cannot devaluate the conclusion that the increased risk of VTE in especially first-time and younger users of third-generation OCs is highly likely. The clinical consequence is therefore that second-generation OCs are the first choice in prescription to first-time users.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24402597>Low-dose  and ethinyl estradiol patch and pill: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>To compare a new low-dose  and ethinyl estradiol contraceptive patch (Patch) with a combination oral contraceptive (Pill; 100 micrograms , 20 micrograms ethinyl estradiol) regarding efficacy, safety, compliance, and unscheduled uterine bleeding.Women (17-40 years;  mass index 16-60) were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to one of two groups: Patch only (13 cycles) or Pill (six cycles) followed by Patch (seven cycles).

Blood samples were taken at admission, 3 and 12 months thereafter. For both pill groups, total cholesterol decreased with duration of use, while HDL cholesterol decreased slightly at 3 months and thereafter increased. LDL cholesterol decreased slightly at 3 months, returning to baseline at 12 months for the monophasic group, while remaining unchanged at 12 months for the triphasic group. The monophasic preparation appeared to lower total, LDL and HDL cholesterols to a greater extent at 3 months than the triphasic preparation.

In addition, ratios of HDL cholesterol/LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol were significantly lower at 12 months. Changes in triglycerides were minimal for both pill groups. However, at 3 months, triglycerides for the triphasic group were significantly higher than the IUD users, but this observation was not of any clinical importance since comparison of changes with their respective pretreatment values were not statistically significant. These results indicate that these changes are related to the dosage and estrogen-progestogen ratio of the preparation.

Among the obese participants, change in glucose was marginally greater with the higher dose pill (p=.06); otherwise, changes between the  mass index groups were not modified by pill dose.Obesity had little effect on any OC-induced changes in carbohydrate or lipid metabolism except for a borderline adverse interaction between obesity and OC dose with respect to fasting glucose and a positive interaction between obesity and OC use with respect to LDL cholesterol.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Proliferation of normal breast epithelium is most extensive during the natural luteal phase. To determine the impact of one cycle of a combined oral contraceptive (COC) on breast homeostasis, we evaluated the proliferation index (PI), determined by KI-67 expression, in normal human mammary epithelial cells and correlated it with cellular proliferation in spontaneous menstrual cycles during the same period. Normal breast tissue samples were obtained from 82 patients randomized in two groups. Forty-two women in group A received one cycle of a COC (30 mug ethinyl estradiol and 150 mug ) administrated daily for 21 days, beginning on the first day of the menstrual cycle. Group B patients (n = 40) experienced a natural menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle phase characterization was based on the date of the last period and subsequent menses and on progesterone serum levels obtained at the time of biopsy. The PI (number of Ki-67-positive nuclei per 1,000 epithelial cells), was significantly larger in group A (5.47 +/- 3.87), than in group B (3.27 +/- 3.24), p < 0.01. A cyclical variation of PI was observed in COC cycles. The rise in PI in the first week of the COC cycles was significantly higher than in the natural cycle (COC = 7.02 +/- 4.94; non-COC = 1.10 +/- 0.67; p < 0.0011). There was no significant difference between the two groups during the other weeks. Additionally, there was an inverse correlation between proliferation and chronological age, irrespective of the stage of the cycle. The PI of COC (p = 0.175) and natural cycles (p = 0.466) were not statistically different in younger patients. COC users have increased proliferative activity at the beginning of the menstrual cycle. This alteration in the pattern of proliferative activity may relate to the increased risk of breast cancer that has been associated with COCs.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22563024>Long-term regression of experimental endometriosis in a rat model treated with local application of -loaded biodegradable microspheres.</a></h2><p>A previous study demonstrated that local application of -loaded polylactic acid microspheres (LNG microspheres) resulted in significant regression of endometriotic cysts in a rabbit model for 6 months without disturbing the metabolic parameters or ovarian function. In order to investigate the feasibility of local application of LNG microspheres as a long-term maintenance treatment for endometriosis, the suppressive effect of a single intra-cystic injection of LNG microspheres was studied for 1 year in a rat model.Twenty four rats with experimental endometriotic cysts were randomized to be treated with a single intra-cystic injection of LNG microspheres (n = 8); 6-month GnRH agonist (GnRHa, n = 8) or control (n = 8). Intra-cystic injection of LNG microspheres and GnRHa treatment caused comparable regression and atrophy in endometriotic cysts in the first 6 months. Compared with the control, the wet  of the endometriotic cysts was significantly lower in both groups at Month 6 but by Month 12 only remained low in the LNG microspheres group (P < 0.01). The immunostaining of estrogen receptors (ERs) in both the epithelium and stroma and progesterone receptors (PRs) in the stroma was significantly weakened in the LNG microspheres group at Month 6 and was not fully restored at Month 12 (P < 0.01). Metabolic parameters and estrous cycle were not disturbed by local application of LNG microspheres.In a rat endometriosis model, the suppressive effect of a single intra-cystic injection of LNG microspheres was comparable to that of GnRHa, and was maintained for 1 year.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the differential impact of four oral or transdermal progestins on the suppression of gonadotropins in healthy men: oral: cyproterone acetate (CPA),  (LNG), norethisterone acetate (NETA), and transdermal: Nestorone (NES), all in combination with transdermal testosterone (T). Randomized clinical trial testing was performed with four progestins at two doses each. After a 2-week progestin-only treatment, transdermal T was added for further 4 weeks and was followed by a 3-week recovery period. Progestin-dose per day: CPA 10 mg/20 mg, NES 2 mg/3 mg/dose e.g. 200/300 μg/day absorbed, NETA 5 mg/10 mg, LNG 120 μg/240 μg. From an andrology outpatient clinic, 56 healthy men aged 18-50 years, with body mass index ≤33 kg × m were included in the study. Serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were studied. Secondary outcome measure included were serum testosterone concentrations, sperm concentrations, and safety parameters. Intergroup comparisons demonstrated that CPA and LNG had the strongest effect on LH/FSH suppression. Nevertheless, every substance showed significant inhibitory effects on gonadotropin secretion, especially in combination with transdermal T. A decrease in hematocrit and insulin sensitivity as well as cholesterol subfractions and triglycerides was uniformly seen for every group. The combination of oral or transdermal progestins with a transdermal testosterone preparation is able to suppress gonadotropins.

The different pharmacological composition of EPs is responsible for different clinical effects. One of the most used low-dose EP associations is ethinylestradiol 20 mcg plus  100 mcg in monophasic regimen (EE20/LNG100). This review summarizes clinical pharmacology, cycle control, and effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, coagulation, / composition, acne, and sexuality of EE20/LNG100. Overall, EE20/LNG100 combination is safe and well tolerated, and in several studies the incidence of adverse events in the treated group was comparable to that of the placebo group. Cycle control was effective and / composition did not vary among treated and untreated groups in most studies. The EE20/LNG100 combination shows mild or no effect on lipid and glucose metabolism. Lastly, EE20/LNG100 is associated with a low risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Heavy menstrual bleeding, a subset of AUB, also referred to as menorrhagia, is defined as menstrual blood loss greater than 80 mL or the patient's perception of excessive blood loss. The newest treatment option available is a novel combination oral contraceptive product containing estradiol valerate (E2V) and dienogest (DNG). As with other combination oral contraceptives, E2V/DNG works primarily by preventing ovulation. However, in contrast with other combination oral contraceptives, it is the progestin component of E2V/DNG that is responsible for endometrial stabilization. Use of E2V/DNG for six months has led to significant reductions in heavy menstrual bleeding with an average 65% reduction in mean blood loss. Approximately half of the women with heavy menstrual bleeding who received E2V/DNG for six months demonstrated an 80% reduction in mean blood loss. Additionally, significant improvements in hematologic indicators (ie, ferritin, hemoglobin, and hematocrit) have been shown. Based on its chemical properties, E2V/DNG may have fewer adverse effects on lipid and glucose  and reduced risk of thromboembolic complications compared with other combination oral contraceptives. This has not yet been shown in clinical trials and until then it should be assumed that E2V/DNG has a safety profile similar to other combination oral contraceptives containing 35 μg or less of ethinyl estradiol. E2V/DNG has been compared with another combination oral contraceptive in healthy women without heavy menstrual bleeding and demonstrated improved bleeding patterns. E2V/DNG has not been compared with the  intrauterine device or other treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. When compared with some other treatment options for AUB, E2V/DNG provides the added advantage of effective contraception.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11861055>Metabolic effects of implantable steroid contraceptives for women.</a></h2><p>The metabolic impact of progestin-only contraceptives is less than that of combined oral contraceptives. Subdermal contraceptive implant systems that provide a sustained release of low levels of progestins are now becoming widely available. This review evaluates the metabolic effects of currently available products that release the progestins  (Norplant, Jadelle, and their Chinese equivalents); etonogestrel (Implanon); nomegestrol acetate (Uniplant); and Nestorone, formally called ST-1435 (Nestorone implant/Elcometrine). Data on liver, kidney, and renal function; carbohydrates and insulin release; hemostasis; blood pressure; and lipids are considered. The metabolic effects reported for these methods as a whole were minimal. Any changes were generally within the normal range for the populations studied and, therefore, are unlikely to be of clinical significance. However, all published studies have been conducted in healthy populations of women.

Recently, further improvement was achieved by increasing the selectivity of contraceptive progestins. The ratio between the affinity for the progesterone receptor and the affinity for the androgen receptor is an indicator of progesterone (or androgen) selectivity of a progestin. This ratio (selectivity index) reflects the relative amount of androgenic or progestational effect at a given dose. Relative selectivity can be characterized with in vitro receptor-binding studies and animal pharmacologic experiments. In comparison with , desogestrel displays markedly lower androgenicity and slightly increased relative progestational activity. In receptor-binding experiments and animal pharmacologic studies, 3-keto-desogestrel, the active metabolite of desogestrel, shows the highest selectivity index. The favorable effect of desogestrel-containing oral contraceptives on lipoprotein  and preexisting androgen-dependent skin disorders and the absence of adverse effects on blood pressure and body weight are attributed to the increased progestin selectivity of desogestrel.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246819>Discordance between self-reported contraceptive use and detection of exogenous hormones among Malawian women enrolling in a randomized clinical trial.</a></h2><p>The objective was to assess the extent of concordance between self-reported contraceptive use and the presence of contraceptive progestins in serum.We evaluated self-reported contraceptive use by using radioimmunoassay to examine baseline serum levels of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and  (LNG) among 97 Malawian women enrolling in a contraceptive trial.Twelve percent (12/97) of study participants who reported no hormonal contraceptive use in the previous 6months had either MPA or LNG detected in their serum.The observed discordance between self-report and detection of exogenous hormones in serum indicates that caution is warranted when drawing conclusions based on self-reported contraceptive use.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1535580>A cross-over study of three oral contraceptives containing ethinyloestradiol and either desogestrel or .</a></h2><p>A randomised cross-over trial was performed to compare the pharmacodynamic actions of three low-dose oral contraceptives (OCs): Marvelon (150 micrograms desogestrel (DSG)+ 30 micrograms ethinyloestradiol (EE)), Mercilon (150 micrograms DSG + 20 micrograms EE) and Microgynon (150 micrograms  (LNG) + 30 micrograms EE).

All OCs produced similar increases in caeruloplasmin but the increase in SHBG was much greater with Marvelon and Mercilon than with Microgynon. Testosterone was reduced more with Microgynon than with the DSG OCs. Many of the changes reflect the strong anti-oestrogenic action of LNG on metabolic parameters compared to DSG.

Thirty-two healthy female subjects participated in an open-label, randomised, crossover trial with 3 treatment periods (oral contraceptive alone, 1 hour before exenatide, 30 minutes after exenatide). Subjects received a single dose of oral contraceptive on Day 8 of each period and QD doses on Days 10 through 28. During treatment periods of concomitant usage, exenatide was administered subcutaneously prior to morning and evening meals at 5 μg BID from Days 1 through 4 and at 10 μg BID from Days 5 through 22. Single- (Day 8) and multiple-dose (Day 22) pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed for each treatment period.Exenatide did not alter the bioavailability nor decrease daily trough concentrations for either oral contraceptive component. No substantive changes in oral contraceptive pharmacokinetics occurred when oral contraceptive was administered 1 hour before exenatide. Single-dose oral contraceptive administration 30 minutes after exenatide resulted in mean (90% CI) Cmax reductions of 46% (42-51%) and 41% (35-47%) for EE and LV, respectively. Repeated daily oral contraceptive administration 30 minutes after exenatide resulted in Cmax reductions of 45% (40-50%) and 27% (21-33%) for EE and LV, respectively. Peak oral contraceptive concentrations were delayed approximately 3 to 4 hours. Mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events observed during the trial.The observed reduction in Cmax is likely of limited importance given the unaltered oral contraceptive bioavailability and trough concentrations; however, for oral medications that are dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy, such as contraceptives and antibiotics, patients should be advised to take those drugs at least 1 hour before exenatide injection.ClinicalTrials.gov: .</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26568900> Intrauterine Device Use in Overweight and Obese Women.</a></h2><p>The  intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) is a safe, effective, long-acting, reversible contraceptive that reduces unintended pregnancy and decreases heavy menstrual bleeding.

The LDL-cholesterol, which was significantly decreased at the end of one year, increased by 2.2% during the second year. However, this rise in LDL-cholesterol was not significant and was still below the preinsertion level. The HDL-cholesterol levels returned to their preinsertion levels after a significant increase in the first year. The HDL-cholesterol/Total cholesterol - HDL-cholesterol ratio returned to its preinsertion value at the end of two years while the LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio was still significantly lower than the preinsertion ratio (p less than 0.05).

Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), is the usual first choice of treatment in women with PCOS. Because OCP use has been linked to the risk of venous thrombosis and there are limited data on the effect of OCP use on the inflammatory state of women with PCOS, our objective was to compare the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 between drug-naive and OCP-treated women with PCOS. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Consequent to women diagnosed with PCOS on the basis of Rotterdam 2003 criteria, either treated with OCPs (ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg, levonogestrel-0.15 mg) for a period of 6 months (n = 50) or drug-naive (n = 51) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study.The mean ages of patients and control participants were comparable (21.99 ± 4.78 vs 21.92 ± 5.83 years; P = .947) as was body mass index (24.47 ± 3.92 vs 23.66 ± 3.43; P = .271). Clinical and androgen excess symptoms were significantly better in the OCP group compared with the drug-naive group (P = .01, P = .04). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the OCP group (P = .01). Plasma ICAM-1 levels, TNF-α levels, and MCP-1 levels showed a higher trend in patients but reached statistical significance only in cases of ICAM-1 and TNF-α (P = .01).OCP treatment of 6 months increases plasma ICAM-1, MCP-1, and TNF-α levels among women with PCOS, although OCPs significantly help in ameliorating features of hyperandrogenism and regularizing menstrual cycles. These cytokines correlate positively with many  parameters including plasma glucose, lipids, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance. Further investigation with well designed, randomized, longitudinal studies might help to ascertain the effect of OCPs on proinflammatory profiles among women with PCOS.Copyright © 2016 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

Our objectives were to determine the effect of hormonal status on intrinsic antiviral (herpes simplex virus [HSV]-1, HSV-2, and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-1) activity of cervicovaginal lavage (CVL).CVL was collected from 165 asymptomatic women including postmenopausal women (n = 29); women not on contraception in days 1-14 (n = 26) or days 15-28 (n = 27) of the menstrual cycle; and women using the  intrauterine device (n = 28), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 28), or combined oral contraceptives (n = 27). The anti-HSV-1/-2 and the anti-HIV-1 activity of the CVL were measured using plaque assays and the Jurkat-Tat-CCR5 assay, respectively.CVL from all of the groups had modest antiviral activity. Anti-HIV-1 activity was decreased in CVL from postmenopausal women when compared to premenopausal women (11% vs 34%, P = .002). However, there was no difference in anti-HIV-1 activity among premenopausal women regardless of phase of menstrual cycle or contraceptive use. Anti-HIV-1 activity was associated with the protein content of the CVL (r = 0.44, P < .001). There was no difference in anti-HSV-1 or -2 activity by hormonal group.Menopause is associated with decreased innate HIV-1 activity in the lower genital tract, suggesting that factors in the vaginal fluid could play a role in increased susceptibility of HIV-1 infection in postmenopausal women.

The use of OCs in women who do not smoke does not result in an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

When OCs are considered for perimenopausal women, it is important to take into account progestogen-only pills. In consequence of the reduced fecundity, these have a better contraceptive efficacy in this age group than in women aged below 35 years. Their only important possible adverse effect is an unpredictable bleeding pattern; further, they do not alleviate climacteric symptoms if these are present.

The aim of this study was to evaluate  and BC in LNG-IUS users compared to users of the TCu380A intrauterine device (IUD).A prospective study was done with 76 new users of both contraceptive methods. Women were paired by age (±2 years) and  mass index (BMI, kg/m², ±2).  and BC (% lean mass and % fat mass) were evaluated by a trained professional at baseline and at 1 year of contraceptive use. The BC measurements were obtained using Lunar DXA equipment.  and BC were evaluated in each woman at baseline and at 12 months and analyzed as the mean change within each woman. Then, the changes in  and BC for each woman were calculated and then compared between LNG-IUS and TCu380A IUD users (paired data for each woman). The central-to-peripheral fat ratio was calculated by dividing trunk fat by the upper and lower limb fat.There were no significant differences at time of IUD insertion between LNG-IUS and TCu380A IUD users regarding age (mean±SD) (34.4±7.5 vs. 33.9±8.0 years), BMI (25.3±4.1 vs. 25.9±4.1) and number of pregnancies (1.9±0.2 vs. 1.7±0.2), respectively.

A new ECP formulation, ulipristal acetate (UPA), is now available worldwide. To determine whether LNG, UPA or COC (Yuzpe) ECPs are safe for women with certain characteristics or medical conditions, we searched the PubMed and Cochrane databases for articles published from date of inception until May 2015 pertaining to the safety of LNG, UPA or Yuzpe ECP use. For direct evidence, we considered studies that looked at safety outcomes among women with certain medical conditions or characteristics taking ECPs compared with women not taking ECPs. For indirect evidence, we considered studies that reported pharmacokinetic (PK) data for ECP use among women with certain medical conditions or characteristics and studies that reported safety outcomes among healthy women taking ECPs. Five studies provided direct evidence; of these five studies, four examined LNG or Yuzpe use among pregnant or breastfeeding women, and one reported risk of ectopic pregnancy among women repeatedly using LNG ECPs. Poor pregnancy outcomes were rare among pregnant women who used LNG or Yuzpe ECPs during the conception cycle or early pregnancy. Breastfeeding outcomes did not differ between women exposed to LNG ECP and those unexposed, and there was no increased risk of ectopic pregnancy versus intrauterine pregnancy after repeated use of LNG ECPs compared with nonuse. Forty-five studies provided indirect evidence. One PK study demonstrated that LNG passes into breastmilk but in minimal quantities. In addition, nine studies examined pregnancy outcomes following ECP failure among healthy women, and 35 articles reported adverse events. Studies suggest that serious adverse events are rare among women taking any of these ECP formulations.Evidence on safety of ECPs among women with characteristics or medical conditions listed within WHO and CDC family planning guidance is limited.

In this parallel-group, randomized, open-label study, healthy premenopausal women received an IVR as the main treatment. Comedications were administered on 3 consecutive evenings during treatment with IVR on days 9-11 (group A, 400 mg miconazole; group B, 100 mg clindamycin; group C, 75 mg nonoxynol-9); tampon co-usage (group D) was performed on days 20-23. The primary PK parameter was the average plasma concentration (C ) of ATZ and LNG at defined intervals, mainly prior to, during, and up to 7 days after the start of comedication. Fifty-two subjects were included, and at least 11 subjects per group completed the treatments. Overall, the medications and comedications were safe and well tolerated. Very similar ATZ and LNG plasma levels were observed across all groups. The calculated ratios of C confirmed the absence of PK interactions because all relevant point estimates and 90% confidence intervals were within the range of 0.800-1.250, which is typically used in bioequivalence studies. These results demonstrate the absence of PK interactions between ATZ/LNG released from IVR and the tested antibiotic, antimycotic, spermicide, and tampons. Therefore, no restrictions for the use of the IVR are needed to continue the clinical program intended to treat endometriosis symptoms.© 2017, The Authors.

A major factor for this increased malignancy risk is prolonged exposure of the endometrium to unopposed estrogen that results from anovulation. Additionally, secretory endometrium of some women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction or receiving exogenous progestin exhibits progesterone resistance accompanied by dysregulation of gene expression controlling steroid action and cell proliferation. Endometrial surveillance includes transvaginal ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy to assess thickened endometrium, prolonged amenorrhea, unopposed estrogen exposure or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medical management for abnormal vaginal bleeding or endometrial hyperplasia consists of estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, cyclic or continuous progestins or a -releasing (Mirena) intrauterine device. Lifestyle modification with caloric restriction and exercise is appropriate to treat  as a concomitant risk factor for developing endometrial disease. An increased risk of ovarian cancer may also exist in some women with PCOS. There are strong data to suggest that oral contraceptive use is protective against ovarian cancer and increases with the duration of therapy. The mechanism of this protection may be through suppression of gonadotropin secretion rather than the prevention of "incessant ovulation". There is no apparent association of PCOS with breast cancer, although the high prevalence of metabolic dysfunction from  is a common denominator for both conditions. Recent data suggest that the use of metformin may be protective for both endometrial and breast cancer. There are insufficient data to evaluate any association between PCOS and vaginal, vulvar and cervical cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We randomly assigned participants to receive either immediate (within 5 days of delivery) or delayed (6 to 8 weeks postpartum) insertion of a two-rod  contraceptive implant system. This is a prespecified secondary analysis evaluating breastfeeding outcomes. The primary outcome of this secondary analysis was change in infant ; infants were weighed and measured at birth and 6 months. We used a validated questionnaire to assess onset of lactogenesis daily in person while participants were in the hospital, and then daily by phone after they left the hospital, until lactogenesis was documented. We used interviewer-administered questionnaires to assess breastfeeding continuation and concerns at 3 months and 6 months postpartum.Among the 96 women randomized to the immediate group and the 87 women to the delayed group, the mean change in infant  from birth to 6 months was similar between groups: 4632 g in the immediate group and 4407 g in the delayed group (p=.26). Among the 97 women who had not experienced lactogenesis prior to randomization, the median time to onset of lactogenesis did not differ significantly between the immediate and delayed groups (65 h versus 63 h; p=.84). Similar proportions of women in the immediate and delayed groups reported exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months (74% versus 71%; p=.74) and 6 months (48% versus 52%; p=.58).We found no association between the timing of postpartum initiation of  contraceptive implants and change in infant growth from birth to 6 months, onset of lactogenesis, or breastfeeding continuation at 3 or 6 months postpartum.This study provides evidence that immediate postpartum initiation of contraception implants does not have a deleterious effect on infant growth or initiation or continuation of breastfeeding.Copyright © 2018.

These contraceptive systems provide low, stable levels of synthetic progestins for periods of months to several years. Unlike earlier injectable and oral contraceptives, they do not cause peaks in progestin levels beyond those required for effective contraception, nor do they employ estrogens. For these reasons, sustained-release progestin systems are without some of the health risks attributed to birth control pills, and they are more effective, as well as easy to use, and completely reversible. They share common side effects, the most frequent of which is irregular menstrual bleeding caused by the erratic shedding of hypotrophic endometrium. Despite this and other minor side effects, most users find the sustained-release systems acceptable alternatives to other methods of contraception. Permanent or biodegradable subdermal implants, injections, intrauterine and intracervical devices, and vaginal rings are all employed as delivery systems for contraceptive progestins. The Norplant (Wyeth Ayerst, Radnor, PA) system, consisting of six silastic tubes filled with  and implanted under the skin, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and is already used by more than a half million women worldwide. The other sustained-release systems are in various stages of development, at least several years away from general use. When these new methods complete clinical trials, women will be able to choose from among implants, injections, or pellets with various durations of action, all providing convenient, highly effective contraception with low risk to health.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27836505>A randomized clinical trial on the effects of progestin contraception in the genital tract of HIV-infected and uninfected women in Lilongwe, Malawi: Addressing evolving research priorities.</a></h2><p>Hormonal contraception is central in the prevention of unintended pregnancy; however there are concerns that certain methods may increase the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. Hormonal contraceptives may modify the genital mucosa in several ways, however the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Few studies have examined genital HIV shedding prospectively before and after initiation of hormonal contraception. The effects of hormonal contraception on genital HIV shedding in the setting of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are also unknown. We designed a pilot clinical trial in which HIV-infected and uninfected women were randomized to either depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injectable or  (LNG) implant in Lilongwe, Malawi. The objectives were to: 1) assess the effect and compare the impact of type of progestin contraception (injectable versus implant) on HIV genital shedding among HIV-infected women, 2) assess the effect and compare the impact of type of progestin contraception on inflammatory/immune markers in the genital tract of both HIV-infected and uninfected women, and 3) assess the interaction of progestin contraception and ART by examining contraceptive efficacy and ART efficacy.

Tailor treatment to the individual patient.</a></h2><p>Uterine leiomyomas are benign, often asymptomatic, tumours of the uterus. When they are symptomatic, the most frequent symptom is heavy, prolonged menstrual bleeding, which stops at menopause. When this blood loss causes iron-deficiency anaemia, iron supplementation is justified. Various treatments aimed at reducing uterine blood loss are proposed for women with leiomyoma-related bleeding. As of late 2013, what is the harm-benefit balance of these treatments? To answer this question, we reviewed the available data using the standard Prescrire methodology. Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is the most radical treatment for the clinical manifestations of uterine leiomyomas. Serious complications sometimes occur. Nine randomised trials including a total of 1553 patients found no advantage in leaving the cervix intact. Randomised trials in about 4500 patients showed that the vaginal approach is preferable to an open abdominal or laparoscopic approach: in particular, it resulted in fewer infections and less bleeding. Myomectomy (selective removal of uterine leiomyomas) is another surgical option, especially when the patient wishes to preserve her fertility. Its evaluation is mainly based on noncomparative case series. As with hysterectomy, it exposes patients to the risk of serious complications. Symptoms recur in 4% to 27% of cases.The reintervention rate is 4% to 20%. Injections of the gonadorelin agonists leuprorelin or triptorelin reduce bleeding associated with leiomyomas, according to several randomised trials. They have not been demonstrated to reduce the need for transfusion or to facilitate subsequent surgery for leiomyomas.The harm-benefit balance of prolonged use of these drugs is unfavourable, due to their numerous adverse effects. The oral progesterone receptor antagonist ulipristal reduces excessive bleeding, but has not been demonstrated to facilitate subsequent surgery.The effects on the endometrium of taking ulipristal for more than 3 months are unknown. The progesterone antagonist mifepristone reduced bleeding in small randomised trials, but increased the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia. The -releasing intrauterine device has mainly been evaluated in non-comparative studies, which suggest that it reduces menstrual bleeding in women with leiomyomas. The risk of expulsion of the device in women with leiomyomas appears to be about 20%. Its main adverse effects are rare cases of acne, depression, headache,  gain and breast tenderness. Very little evaluation data is available on oral progestins in this situation. A progestin, such as norethisterone, taken from the 5th to the 26th day of the menstrual cycle seems to reduce menstrual blood loss and has a contraceptive effect. Oral progestins expose women to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and possibly increase the risk of breast cancer. Their harm-benefit balance seems less favourable than that of the -releasing intrauterine device. The thrombotic risk associated with tranexamic acid is unclear, but deserves serious consideration given the drug's uncertain efficacy. In practice, the treatment should be chosen with the patient, based on various factors, including severity of symptoms, age, desire to preserve fertility or the uterus, characteristics of the leiomyomas, and patient preference. As of late 2013, when drug treatment is considered useful in postponing surgery or while awaiting menopause, the -releasing intrauterine device is the first choice. Oral progestins are another alternative, although their adverse effects are unclear when taken for several months. It is better to avoid exposing patients to the other available drugs, and to choose iron supplementation for women who develop anaemia.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28041992>Changes in  composition in women using long-acting reversible contraception.</a></h2><p>Users of hormonal long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) report  gain as a side effect, but few studies have assessed  composition change among LARC users.

Interestingly, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-depleted cells exhibited a dramatic decrease in proliferation rate and abolition of anchorage-independent growth. Prolonged exposure to exogenous oleic acid did not reverse either the slower proliferation or loss of anchorage-independent growth of hSCDas cells, suggesting that endogenous synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids is essential for rapid cell replication and invasiveness, two hallmarks of neoplastic transformation. Moreover, apoptosis was increased in hSCDas cells in a ceramide-independent manner. Finally, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-deficient cells were more sensitive to palmitic acid-induced apoptosis compared with control cells. Our data suggest that, by globally regulating , stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity modulates cell proliferation and survival and emphasize the important role of endogenously synthesized monounsaturated fatty acids in sustaining the neoplastic phenotype of transformed cells.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25895986>CCR5 Expression Levels in HIV-Uninfected Women Receiving Hormonal Contraception.</a></h2><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectivity increases as receptor/coreceptor expression levels increase. We determined peripheral CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 expression levels in HIV-uninfected women who used depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA; n = 32), the -releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD; n = 27), oral contraceptive pills (n = 32), or no hormonal contraception (n = 33). The use of LNG-IUD increased the proportion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that expressed CCR5; increases in the magnitude of T-cell subset CCR5 expression were observed with DMPA and LNG-IUD use (P < .01 for all comparisons). LNG-IUD and, to a lesser extent, DMPA use were associated with increased peripheral T-cell CCR5 expression.© The Author 2015.

We present safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, acceptability and drug release data in healthy women. CONRAD A13-128 was a randomized, placebo controlled phase I study. We screened 86 women; 51 were randomized to TFV, TFV/LNG or placebo IVR [2:2:1] and 50 completed all visits, using the IVR for approximately 15 days. We assessed safety by adverse events, colposcopy, vaginal , epithelial integrity, mucosal histology and immune cell numbers and phenotype, cervicovaginal [CV] cytokines and antimicrobial proteins and changes in systemic laboratory measurements, and LNG and TFV pharmacokinetics in multiple compartments. TFV pharmacodynamic activity was measured by evaluating CV fluid [CVF] and tissue for antiviral activity using in vitro models. LNG pharmacodynamic assessments were timed based on peak urinary luteinizing hormone levels. All IVRs were safe with no significant colposcopic, mucosal, immune and  changes and were acceptable. Among TFV containing IVR users, median and mean CV aspirate TFV concentrations remained above 100,000 ng/mL 4 hours post IVR insertion and mean TFV-diphosphate [DP] concentrations in vaginal tissue remained above 1,000 fmol/mg even 3 days post IVR removal. CVF of women using TFV-containing IVRs completely inhibited [94-100%] HIV infection in vitro. TFV/LNG IVR users had mean serum LNG concentrations exceeding 300 pg/mL within 1 hour, remaining high throughout IVR use. All LNG IVR users had a cervical mucus Insler score <10 and the majority [95%] were anovulatory or had abnormal cervical mucus sperm penetration. Estimated in vivo TFV and LNG release rates were within expected ranges. All IVRs were safe with the active ones delivering sustained high concentrations of TFV locally. LNG caused changes in cervical mucus, sperm penetration, and ovulation compatible with contraceptive efficacy. The TFV and TFV/LNG rings are ready for expanded 90 day clinical testing.

Progestogen administered by a device with a 5-year lifespan, has been shown to be an effective medical alternative with several advantages. The aims of this study were to investigate its efficacy, continuation rates and side-effects in women with endometriosis over a 3-year period.Thirty-four women with laparoscopically confirmed minimal to moderate symptomatic endometriosis offered insertion of an intrauterine device at diagnostic laparoscopy were followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months, and then every 6 months for 3 years. A symptom diary for side-effects, documentation of symptoms on a visual analogue scale (VAS), a verbal rating scale (VRS) and quantified menstrual loss using the pictorial blood loss chart was used to assess response to treatment.The continuation rates were respectively 85%, 68%, 62% and 56% at, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Discontinuation rates were highest at <12 months, and most of these were for irregular and intolerable bleeding and persistent pain. An improvement in symptoms was observed throughout the 36 months. The greatest changes in pain assessed by either the VAS or VRS were between the pretreatment scores and those after 12 months (7.7 +/- 1.3 versus 3.5 +/- 1.8 for VAS, P < 0.001; and 25 +/- 13.8 versus 14 +/- 9.4 for VRS, P < 0.002). The monthly quantified blood loss fell from 204 (196) pretreatment to 60 (50) at 12 months (P < 0.001) and then to 70 (30) after 36 months. The most common side-effects were bleeding irregularities (14.7%), one-sided abdominal pain (11.8%) and  gain (8.8%).Intrauterine progestogen is effective in symptom control throughout the 3 years on the device, and discontinuation is greatest between 3 and 6 months.

The first visit entailed a blood draw, uterine lavage and endometrial biopsy followed by LNG-IUS insertion. Follow-up visit involved a repeat serum draw, uterine lavage and endometrial biopsy. Cytokine levels were measured in the uterine lavage and serum by quantifying inflammatory biomarkers. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed on the endometrial tissue to measure macrophage levels. Statistical analysis included a nonparametric analysis that compared medians of the marker levels before and after intrauterine device (IUD) insertion within the group and between the two groups.Sixteen participants completed the study: 5 solid organ transplant patients and 11 healthy patients. For the serum, there were no marked changes in the cytokines or soluble receptor levels in either group after IUD insertion. However, in the uterine lavage, there was an increase in cytokine levels post-IUD insertion for both healthy and transplant women. For the endometrial tissue, there was evidence of macrophage activity in both groups after device insertion.This pilot study investigated the uterine environment of the transplant patient population. Findings have pointed to the strong local inflammatory response following LNG-IUS insertion for the transplant recipients. In addition, these preliminary findings will help power a larger study that can investigate the safety and effectiveness of the IUD in this patient population.Findings from this pilot study suggest that the IUD is inducing a local inflammatory reaction in the uterus of the transplant patient as in the healthy control.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a 1-yr course of oral DHEA treatment vs. conventional hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) in young women with AN. Sixty-one young women were randomly assigned to receive oral DHEA (50 mg/d) or HRT (20 micro g ethinyl estradiol/0.1 mg ). Anthropometric, nutrition, and exercise data were acquired every 3 months, and bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition were measured by dual  x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) every 6 months over 1 yr. Serum samples were obtained for measurements of hormones, proresorptive cytokines, and bone formation markers, and urine was collected for determinations of bone resorption markers at each visit. In initial analyses, total hip BMD increased significantly and similarly (+1.7%) in both groups. Hip BMD increases were positively correlated with increases in IGF-I (r = 0.44; P = 0.030) and the bone formation marker, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase increased significantly only in the DHEA treatment group (P = 0.003). However, both groups gained significant amounts of weight over the year of therapy, and after controlling for weight gain, no treatment effect was detectable. There was no significant change in lumbar BMD in either group. Both bone formation markers, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, increased transiently at 6-9 months in those subjects receiving DHEA compared with the estrogen-treated group (P < 0.05). Both DHEA and HRT significantly reduced levels of the bone resorption markers, urinary N-telopeptides (P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between changes in IGF-I and changes in weight, body fat determined by DXA, and estradiol for both groups. In addition, patients receiving DHEA exhibited improvement on three validated psychological instruments (Eating Attitudes Test, Anorexia Nervosa Subtest, and Spielberger Anxiety Inventory). Both DHEA and HRT had similar effects on hip and spinal BMD. Over the year of treatment, maintenance of both hip and spinal BMD was seen, but there was no significant increase after accounting for weight gain. Compared with HRT, DHEA appeared to have anabolic effects, evidenced by the positive correlation between increases in hip DXA measurements and IGF-I and significant increases in bone formation markers. Both therapies significantly decreased bone resorption. Replicating results from studies of the elderly, DHEA resulted in improvements in specific psychological parameters in these young women.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28624570>Effects of intrauterine contraception on the vaginal .</a></h2><p>There have been conflicting reports of altered vaginal  and infection susceptibility associated with contraception use. The objectives of this study were to determine if intrauterine contraception altered the vaginal  and to compare the effects of a copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) and a  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on the vaginal .DNA was isolated from the vaginal swab samples of 76 women using Cu-IUD (n=36) or LNG-IUS (n=40) collected prior to insertion of intrauterine contraception (baseline) and at 6 months. A third swab from approximately 12 months following insertion was available for 69 (Cu-IUD, n=33; LNG-IUS, n=36) of these women. The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA-encoding gene was amplified from the vaginal swab DNA and sequenced. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were processed and analyzed using the software package mothur to compare the structure and dynamics of the vaginal bacterial communities.The vaginal  from individuals in this study clustered into 3 major vaginal bacterial community types: one dominated by Lactobacillus iners, one dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus and one community type that was not dominated by a single Lactobacillus species. Changes in the vaginal bacterial community composition were not associated with the use of Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS. Additionally, we did not observe a clear difference in vaginal  stability with Cu-IUD versus LNG-IUS use.Although the vaginal  can be highly dynamic, alterations in the community associated with the use of intrauterine contraception (Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS) were not detected over 12 months.We found no evidence that intrauterine contraception (Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS) altered the vaginal  composition. Therefore, the use of intrauterine contraception is unlikely to shift the composition of the vaginal  such that infection susceptibility is altered.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We examined whether immunity in women using injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), combined oral contraceptives (COC), or no HCs differs by the presence of cervicovaginal infections. Immune mediators were quantified in cervical swabs from 832 HIV-uninfected reproductive-age Ugandans and Zimbabweans. Bacterial infections and HIV were diagnosed by PCR, genital herpes serostatus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), altered microflora by Nugent score, and Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida albicans infection by wet mount. Generalized linear models utilizing Box-Cox-Power transformation examined associations between levels of mediators, infection status, and HCs. In no-HC users, T. vaginalis was associated with broadest spectrum of aberrant immunity (higher interleukin 1β [IL-1β], IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein 3α [MIP-3α], β-defensin 2 [BD2], and IL-1 receptor antigen [IL-1RA]). In women with a normal Nugent score and no genital infection, compared to the no-HC group, COC users showed higher levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1RA, while DMPA users showed higher levels of RANTES and lower levels of BD2, both associated with HIV seroconversion. These effects of COC were blunted in the presence of gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidiasis, and an abnormal Nugent score; however, RANTES was increased among COC users with herpes, chlamydia, and abnormal Nugent scores. The effect of DMPA was exacerbated by lower levels of IL-1RA in gonorrhea, chlamydia, or herpes, SLPI in gonorrhea, and IL-1β, MIP-3α, and IL-1RA/IL1β ratio in trichomoniasis. Thus, the effects of HC on cervical immunity depend on the genital tract microenvironment, and a weakened mucosal barrier against HIV may be a combined resultant of genital tract infections and HC use.In this article, we show that in young reproductive-age women most vulnerable to HIV, hormonal contraceptives are associated with altered cervical immunity in a manner dependent on the presence of genital tract infections. Through altered immunity, hormones may predispose women to bacterial and viral pathogens; conversely, a preexisting specific infection or disturbed vaginal  may suppress the immune activation by  or exacerbate the suppressed immunity by DMPA, thus increasing HIV risk by their cumulative action. Clinical studies assessing the effects of contraception on HIV susceptibility and mucosal immunity may generate disparate results in populations that differ by  background or prevalence of undiagnosed genital tract infections. A high prevalence of asymptomatic infections among HC users that remain undiagnosed and untreated raises even more concerns in light of their combined effects on biomarkers of HIV risk. The molecular mechanisms of the vaginal microbiome's simultaneous interactions with hormones and HIV remain to be elucidated.Copyright © 2015 Fichorova et al.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'immunity', 'microbiome', 'microbiota']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19606192>Haemostatic function in Norplant () users: a 3-year prospective experience in Benin-City, Nigeria.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the haemostatic function and menstrual pattern of Norplant acceptors after 36 months of use.This was a prospective longitudinal study that involved fifty five healthy, non-breastfeeding, sexually active informed volunteers recruited from our family planning clinic, between September and December 2002.

The same was true for mean fasting-serum glucose levels (7.4 mM, SD +/- 4.2 compared with 7.5 mM, SD +/- 4.2) and daily insulin doses (35.1 units, SD +/- 12.8 compared with 36.4 units, SD +/- 9.0). No important differences were noted at either 6 weeks or 6 months.The -releasing device had no adverse effect on glucose metabolism, even at the 6-week observation when systemic levels of  would have been higher than at later observations. Concern about a potential adverse effect of this contraceptive on glucose control is unwarranted, and its use in women with  should be liberalized.I.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323981>Ovarian Lipid  Modulates Circulating Lipids in Premenopausal Women.</a></h2><p>The premenopausal circulating lipid profile may be linked to the hormonal profile and ovarian lipid .Assess how estradiol, progesterone, and ovarian lipid  contributes to the premenopausal lipid profile; and evaluate the acute effects of a common hormonal oral contraceptive (OC) on circulating lipids.Experimental crossover with repeated measures.Academic hospitals.Eight healthy, regularly menstruating women.Participants underwent periodic serum sampling during a normal menstrual cycle; a standard 21-day, monophasic combined hormonal OC cycle (30 µg of ethinyl estradiol and 150 µg of  per day); menopause simulated by leuprolide acetate (22.5-mg depot); and an artificial menstrual cycle achieved via transdermal estradiol (50 to 300 µg/d) and vaginal micronized progesterone (100 to 300 mg/d).Primary outcomes included evaluation of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and the total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio.

Desogestrel, norgestimate, and gestodene have minimal amounts of androgenicity and antiestrogenic potential. All of these agents are pharmacokinetically similar to older agents: they are highly bioavailable when administered orally, hepatically metabolized, and obtain steady-state concentrations after 8-10 days of continuous administration. The newer agents have similar Pearl Indexes and slightly better cycle control. Furthermore, the new progestins appear to cause fewer adverse effects, such as acne and hirsuitism, and similar rates of weight gain, blood pressure changes, and  and carbohydrate  changes.Desogestrel, norgestimate, and gestodene appear to offer clinical advantages because of their decreased androgenicity. Women whose cycles are currently well controlled with other OCs should not be switched to a newer progestin. However, any of the combination OC products that contain these progestins may be prescribed for women intolerant of older agents or to first-time users of OCs.

Current data indicate that medium- and low-fixed-dose oral contraceptive formulations containing estrogen/norethindrone acetate have less metabolic impact than do comparable -containing formulations, including multiphasic formulations. Triphasic formulations may have less effect on coronary heart disease risk factors, although data are not yet conclusive. Novel progestins such as desogestrel may also have lesser effects on metabolic functions, but the reduced androgenicity of such compounds may expose women to an increased risk of estrogen-induced hypertriglyceridemia.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'fat metabolism', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22762147>Effects on bone mineral density of a monophasic combined oral contraceptive containing nomegestrol acetate/17β-estradiol in comparison to /ethinylestradiol.</a></h2><p>To compare the effects of a monophasic combined oral contraceptive containing nomegestrol acetate/17β-estradiol (NOMAC/E2) on bone mineral density with a combined oral contraceptive containing /ethinylestradiol (LNG/EE).Prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative clinical study.Gynecology center in Norway.One hundred and ten women (20-35 years old) actively seeking contraception. Methods. For 26 consecutive 28-day cycles, women received one of the following two treatments: NOMAC/E2 (2.5 mg/1.5 mg) in a 24/4-day regimen (n= 56); or LNG/EE (150 μg/30 μg) in a 21/7-day regimen (n= 54). Main outcome measures. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, hip and trochanter (measured by dual  X-ray absorptiometry); associated z-scores of the lumbar spine and femoral neck.In NOMAC/E2 users, mean (±SD) z-score change from baseline for lumbar spine and femoral neck were 0.019 ± 0.242 and -0.007 ± 0.228, respectively, vs. 0.121 ± 0.269 and 0.044 ± 0.253 in LNG/EE users, respectively. Differences between treatment groups were not significant (p= 0.19 and p= 0.57, respectively). There were no significant differences between changes in hip and trochanter z-scores between NOMAC/E2 and LNG/EE treatments.After two years, NOMAC/E2 had no clinically relevant effect on bone mineral density.

Women were classified as oral contraceptive users (n = 687 women), -releasing intrauterine device users (n = 168 women), or no use of hormonal contraception (reference group; n = 1959 women). The analyses were adjusted for body mass index, current alcohol use, household income, and area of residence.Compared with the reference group, oral contraceptive users had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, raised levels of inflammatory indices (C-reactive protein), and impaired  sensitivity. -releasing intrauterine device users displayed a lower high-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol, but a similar cholesterol/ high-density lipoprotein ratio, and higher leukocyte count compared with the reference group. Oral contraception users were -resistant compared with -releasing intrauterine device users with higher blood pressure, raised lipid levels (such as total cholesterol and triglycerides) and  levels, and lower homeostasis model assessment and  sensitivity, despite smaller waist and lower waist-hip ratio.Oral contraception usage was associated with adverse findings in several metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory parameters, which is consistent with an increased future risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. These findings should invite more criticism of recent trends that encourage the prescription of oral contraceptives for years during reproductive life and especially in premenopausal women. In contrast, -releasing intrauterine device or progestin-only pills may offer long-term health benefits over oral contraceptives and should be preferred to oral contraceptives for women in their forties and/or with metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8521763>Gestodene. A review of its pharmacology, efficacy and tolerability in combined contraceptive preparations.</a></h2><p>The newer progestogens gestodene, desogestrel and norgestimate were developed in an attempt to produce agents with more selective progestational activity that would improve cycle control and minimise metabolic changes and adverse events while effectively preventing pregnancy. In clinical practice, gestodene is combined with ethinylestradiol in monophasic or triphasic combined oral contraceptive preparations. The drug has pharmacokinetic advantages over the other new progestogens in that it is active per se (the others are prodrugs) and has high bioavailability (approximately 100%). The ability of gestodene-containing oral contraceptives to inhibit ovulation is similar to that of preparations containing other progestogens although the required dosage is lower. In common with oral contraceptives containing desogestrel or norgestimate, and in contrast with those containing , gestodene-containing preparations are associated with neutral or positive changes in  and carbohydrate . The effects of gestodene preparations on coagulation parameters, like those of desogestrel and , are balanced by changes in the fibrinolytic system. Although the impact of these changes on clinical cardiovascular end-points has not been determined, the altered  profile is not likely to have significant clinical relevance because of the predominantly thrombogenic nature of cardiovascular disease in oral contraceptive users. Pregnancy rates and Pearl Indices with gestodene-containing preparations are low and similar to those with preparations containing other progestogens. Most pregnancies are attributable to user failure. Cycle control appears to be better with gestodene preparations than with  preparations, and available data suggest that cycle control may also be better with monophasic gestodene/ethinylestradiol than with monophasic desogestrel- or norgestimate-containing preparations, and better with triphasic gestodene- than with triphasic - or norgestimate-containing preparations. However, differences between the new progestogen-containing preparations need to be confirmed in further large-scale trials. The most common adverse events with gestodene/ethinylestradiol are headaches and breast tension; the incidence of short term adverse events, including acne, is similar to that with preparations containing other progestogens. Changes in blood pressure and bodyweight are negligible. There are no comparative data on the incidence of cardiovascular events with gestodene-containing and other combined preparations. While the risk of breast cancer appears to be increased with long term combined oral contraceptive use in certain patient subgroups, this risk needs to be balanced against the noncontraceptive benefits of these preparations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26394847>Inhibition of ovulation by administration of estetrol in combination with drospirenone or : Results of a phase II dose-finding pilot study.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of different dosages of estetrol (E4) combined with one of two progestins in suppressing the pituitary-ovarian axis and ovulation in healthy premenopausal women.This was an open, parallel, phase II, dose-finding, pilot study performed in healthy women aged 18 to 35 years with a documented ovulatory cycle before treatment. For three consecutive cycles in a 24/4-day regimen, participants received 5 mg or 10 mg E4/3 mg drospirenone (DRSP); 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg E4/150 μg ; or 20 μg ethinylestradiol (EE)/3 mg DRSP as comparator. Pituitary-ovarian axis activity and the occurrence of ovulation were evaluated by monitoring follicular size, serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, estradiol and progesterone during treatment cycles 1 and 3. Endometrial thickness was evaluated throughout the trial, and the return of ovulation was evaluated after the last intake of medication.A total of 109 women were included in the trial. No ovulation occurred in any treatment group. Ovarian activity inhibition seemed proportional to the E4 dosage: the highest suppression was observed in the 20 mg E4 group and was very similar to that observed with EE/DRSP. Endometrial thickness was suppressed to the same extent in all groups. Post-treatment ovulation occurred in all participants between 17 and 21 days after the last active treatment. The study combinations were well tolerated and safe.Combined with a progestin, E4 adequately suppresses ovarian activity, particularly when given at a dosage above 10 mg/day.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25793657>Combined hormonal versus nonhormonal versus progestin-only contraception in lactation.</a></h2><p>Postpartum contraception improves the health of mothers and children by lengthening birth intervals. For lactating women, contraception choices are limited by concerns about hormonal effects on milk quality and quantity and passage of hormones to the infant. Ideally, the contraceptive chosen should not interfere with lactation or infant growth. Timing of contraception initiation is also important. Immediately postpartum, most women have contact with a health professional, but many do not return for follow-up contraceptive counseling. However, immediate initiation of hormonal methods may disrupt the onset of milk production.To determine the effects of hormonal contraceptives on lactation and infant growthWe searched for eligible trials until 2 March 2015. Sources included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, POPLINE, Web of Science, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. We also examined review articles and contacted investigators.We sought randomized controlled trials in any language that compared hormonal contraception versus another form of hormonal contraception, nonhormonal contraception, or placebo during lactation. Hormonal contraception includes combined or progestin-only oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, implants, and intrauterine devices.Trials had to have one of our primary outcomes: breast milk quantity or biochemical composition; lactation initiation, maintenance, or duration; infant growth; or timing of contraception initiation and effect on lactation. Secondary outcomes included contraceptive efficacy while breastfeeding and birth interval.For continuous variables, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For dichotomous outcomes, we computed the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. Due to differing interventions and outcome , we did not aggregate the data in a meta-analysis.In 2014, we added seven trials for a new total of 11. Five reports were published before 1985 and six from 2005 to 2014. They included 1482 women. Four trials examined combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and three studied a -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). We found two trials of progestin-only pills (POPs) and two of the etonogestrel-releasing implant. Older studies often lacked quantified results. Most trials did not report significant differences between the study arms in breastfeeding duration, breast milk composition, or infant growth. Exceptions were seen mainly in older studies with limited information.For breastfeeding duration, two of eight trials indicated a negative effect on lactation. A COC study reported a negative effect on lactation duration compared to placebo but did not quantify results. Another trial showed a lower percentage of the LNG-IUS group breastfeeding at 75 days versus the nonhormonal IUD group (reported P < 0.05) but no significant difference at one year.For breast milk volume, two older studies indicated lower volume for the COC group versus the placebo group. One trial did not quantify results. The other showed lower means (mL) for the COC group, e.g. at 16 weeks (MD -24.00, 95% CI -34.53 to -13.47) and at 24 weeks (MD -24.90, 95% CI -36.01 to -13.79). Another four trials did not report any significant difference between the study groups in milk volume or composition with two POPs, a COC, or the etonogestrel implant.Seven trials studied infant growth; one showed greater  gain (grams) for the etonogestrel implant versus no method for six weeks (MD 426.00, 95% CI 58.94 to 793.06) but less compared with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) from 6 to 12 weeks (MD -271.00, 95% CI -355.10 to -186.90). The others studied POPs, COCs versus POPs, or an LNG-IUS.Results were not consistent across the 11 trials. The evidence was limited for any particular hormonal method. The quality of evidence was moderate overall and low for three of four placebo-controlled trials of COCs or POPs. The sensitivity analysis included six trials with moderate quality evidence and sufficient outcome data. Five trials indicated no significant difference between groups in breastfeeding duration (etonogestrel implant insertion times, COC versus POP, and LNG-IUS). For breast milk volume or composition, a COC study showed a negative effect, while an implant trial showed no significant difference. Of four trials that assessed infant growth, three indicated no significant difference between groups. One showed greater  gain in the etonogestrel implant group versus no method but less versus DMPA.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17636649>Danazol for heavy menstrual bleeding.</a></h2><p>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important cause of ill health in pre menopausal women. Medical therapy, with the avoidance of possibly unnecessary surgery is an attractive treatment option, but there is considerable variation in practice and uncertainty about the most effective therapy. Danazol is a synthetic steroid with anti-oestrogenic and anti progestogenic activity, and weak androgenic properties. Danazol suppresses oestrogen and progesterone receptors in the endometrium, leading to endometrial atrophy (thinning of the lining of the uterus) and reduced menstrual loss and to amenorrhoea in some women.To determine the effectiveness and tolerability of Danazol when used for heavy menstrual bleeding in women of reproductive years.We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's Specialised Register (April 2007). We also searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007), EMBASE (1980 to April 2007, CINAHL (1982 to April 2007). Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of included trials and relevant review articles.Randomised controlled trials of Danazol versus placebo, any other medical (non-surgical) therapy or Danazol in different dosages for heavy menstrual bleeding in women of reproductive age with regular HMB measured either subjectively or objectively. Trials that included women with post menopausal bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding and pathological causes of heavy menstrual bleeding were excluded.Nine RCTs, with 353 women, were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. The main outcomes were menstrual blood loss, the number of women experiencing adverse effects,  gain, withdrawals due to adverse effects and dysmenorrhoea. If data could not be extracted in a form suitable for meta-analysis, they were presented in a descriptive format.Most data were not in a form suitable for meta analysis, and the results are based on a small number of trials, all of which are under-powered. Danazol appears to be more effective than placebo, progestogens, NSAIDs and the OCP at reducing MBL, but confidence intervals were wide. Treatment with Danazol caused more adverse events than NSAIDs (OR 7.0; 95% CI 1.7 to 28.2) and progestogens (OR 4.05, 95% CI 1.6 to10.2). Danazol was shown to significantly lower the duration of menses when compared with NSAIDs (WMD -1.0; 95% CI -1.8 to -0.3) and a progesterone releasing IUD (WMD -6.0; 95% CI -7.3 to -4.8). There were no randomised trials comparing Danazol with tranexamic acid or the -releasing intrauterine system.Danazol appears to be an effective treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding compared to other medical treatments. The use of Danazol may be limited by its side effect profile, its acceptability to women and the need for continuing treatment. The small number of trials, and the small sample sizes of the included trials limit the recommendations for clinical care. Further studies are unlikely in the future and this review will not be updated unless further studies are identified.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25634167>Comparative study of the effects of combined oral contraceptives in hemostatic variables: an observational preliminary study.</a></h2><p>Thrombotic risk is associated with the estrogen dose and type of progestin in combined oral contraceptives. Studies published since 1990 showed that third-generation progestins have larger risk to contribute to thrombosis development than the second-generation. However, there are conflicts in the literature regarding the thrombotic risk associated to the drospirenone progestin. So, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of 3 formulations of contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (EE) (20 and 30 μg) combined with drospirenone versus  combined with EE (30 μg) in hemostatic parameters. This cross-sectional study included 70 healthy women between 18 and 30 years, BMI 19 to 30 kg/m², not pregnant, non-smokers, and users or non-users (control) of contraceptives for a minimum period of 6 months. The following parameters were assessed: prothrombin time (PT), Factor VII, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), Factor XII, fibrinogen, Factor 1 + 2, Protein C, Protein S, antithrombin, D-dimers, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Significant alterations were found in PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, D-dimers, and protein S, all favoring a state of hypercoagulation for contraceptive containing DRSP/20EE. Both contraceptives containing DRSP/30EE and LNG/30EE promoted changes that favor the hypercoagulability in the coagulant variable PT and in the anticoagulant variables Protein S and Protein C, respectively. We suggest that the progestin drospirenone can contribute to an inadequate balance among procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic factors, since that the contraceptive containing the lowest dose of estrogen and drospirenone (DRSP/20EE) caused a higher number of hemostatic changes.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26341277>Low-dose progestin-releasing contraceptives are associated with a higher pain threshold in healthy women.</a></h2><p>To determine the pain thresholds of women taking different formulations of hormonal contraceptives.Cross-sectional study.Basic health care unit.Eighty-nine healthy nonusers and 188 users of hormonal contraceptives.Subject interviews were followed by the application of a semistructured questionnaire, including a psychometric assessment with the Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.

Contraceptive guidance as part of the pre-pregnancy counselling needs to be more widely implemented by general practitioners and in non-specialized obstetrical and gynaecological departments. Women with diabetes are generally well motivated, and thus the barrier methods may prove both acceptable and reliable contraceptive agents for some of these women. When, however, a high risk of user failure can be predicted, the IUD or hormonal contraception may be the only reversible alternative. According to our findings, IUDs can be recommended without reservation to women with IDDM. In women with previous GDM it seems that low dose oral contraceptive compounds may be administered without running the risk of inducing glucose intolerance, but long-term results are still unavailable. Natural oestrogens may be administered in combination with a progestogen for a limited period as an efficient and acceptable mode of contraception in women with IDDM without any concomitant adverse effects on diabetic control. From our investigations it also appears that short-term administration of combined low dose OCs containing the traditional progestogens (e.g. norethisterone or ) or the new gonane progestogens (e.g. gestodene) does not alter glycaemic control in women with IDDM. Similarly, these compounds do not cause any significant changes in /lipoprotein levels during short-term treatment, although the intake of monophasic ethinyloestradiol/norethisterone preparations may result in higher triglyceride levels and tends to increase  levels more than triphasic ethinyloestradiol/ compounds.

A statistically significant treatment difference was found between LNG/EE 21/7 and the reference group (1.05%; 95% confidence interval, 0.61%-1.49%) but not between LNG/EE extended regimen and the reference group (0.23%; 95% confidence interval, -0.20% to 0.67%). No new safety signals were noted.Compared with the reference group, bone accrual was statistically significantly lower among LNG/EE 21/7 users but not among LNG/EE 30-μg extended regimen users. Additional research is needed to clarify the clinical relevance of these findings.Copyright © 2016 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Given the high prevalence of anxiety and restlessness in younger women, oral contraceptives and Silexan will likely be co-administered.A double-blind, randomised, 2-period crossover study was performed to investigate the effects of Silexan on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Microgynon(®), a combination oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg (EE) and  0.15 mg (LNG) in healthy, fertile, adult females. During 2 consecutive cycles of 28 days, oral contraception was given for 21 days combined with 1 × 160 mg/day Silexan or placebo. Plasma concentration-time profiles of EE and LNG were obtained on day 18 ± 1 up to 24 h after dosing. The primary outcome measure was the area under the concentration-time curve over a dosing interval of τ = 24 h (AUCτ) for EE and LNG plasma levels. An interaction with Silexan was formally excluded if the 90 % confidence interval for the AUCτ ratio during co-administration with Silexan or placebo was included within the range of 0.80-1.25. Secondary outcomes included EE and LNG peak concentration (C max) and time to C max (t max), follicle size, endometrial thickness, the Hoogland score, and serum levels of estradiol, progesterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin.A total of 24 women (mean age 27.3 years; mean body mass index 22.2 kg/m(2)) participated. The confidence intervals for the EE and LNG AUCτ and C max ratios fell within the pre-specified limits, indicating no interaction (point estimates [Silexan/placebo] AUCτ EE 0.97, LNG 0.94; C max EE 0.99, LNG 0.96). For LNG, t max was slightly delayed. No secondary outcome indicated any impairment of contraceptive efficacy.Co-administration of Silexan did not affect the efficacy of a combination oral contraceptive containing EE and LNG and was well tolerated.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8150435>[Study on compound  microspheres].</a></h2><p> (LNG) and estradiol (E2) were mixed in the ratio of 5:2 by weight. Compound LNG gelatin-microspheres were prepared by phase-separation method, natural biodegradable gelatin being used as the core material. The experimental conditions were optimized, the mean diameter of the microspheres obtained being 10-40 microns, and the rate of encapsulation 65-75%. Storage observations and acceleration tests of the compound LNG gelatin-microsphere injection prepared showed that the microspheres have good stability. The thermal degradation activation  of the injection was determined to be 134.4 kJ/mol, based on differential scanning colorimetry (DSC). T1/2 values for dissolution in vitro of LNG and E2 from the compound LNG gelatin-microsphere injection and from the unencapsulated injection showed significant difference (P < 0.01), indicating that the microspheres have good sustained release action. Effects of the pure LNG microsphere injection and compound LNG microsphere injection on the mouse ovary were compared histologically. The results showed that the compound LNG microsphere injection reduced some of the side effects such as ovary congestion. This points out that the compound dosage form can clinically alleviate the irregular bleeding caused by the administration of LNG alone.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26371177>The -releasing intrauterine system is associated with delayed endocervical clearance of Chlamydia trachomatis without alterations in vaginal .</a></h2><p>Progestin-based contraception may impact women's susceptibility to sexually transmitted infection. We evaluated the effect of the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on cervical persistence of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in a baboon model. Female olive baboons (Papio anubis) with or without an LNG-IUS received CT or sham inoculations. CT was detected in cervical epithelium with weekly nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) and culture. Presence of the LNG-IUS was associated with prolonged persistence of CT. Median time to post-inoculation clearance of CT as detected by NAAT was 10 weeks (range 7-12) for animals with an LNG-IUS and 3 weeks (range 0-12) for non-LNG-IUS animals (P = 0.06). Similarly, median time to post-inoculation clearance of CT by culture was 9 weeks (range 3-12) for LNG-IUS animals and 1.5 weeks (range 0-10) for non-LNG-IUS animals (P = 0.04). We characterized the community structure of the vaginal  with the presence of the LNG-IUS to determine if alterations in CT colonization dynamics were associated with changes in vaginal commensal bacteria. Vaginal swabs were collected weekly for microbiome analysis. Endocervical CT infection was not correlated with alterations in the vaginal . Together, these results suggest that LNG-IUS may facilitate CT endocervical persistence through a mechanism distinct from vaginal microbial alterations.© FEMS 2015. All rights reserved.

However, unpredictable menstrual bleeding constitutes the principal reason for premature discontinuation, particularly in the cases of the ENG-implant and the LNG-IUS.A randomized clinical trial was conducted between 2011 and 2013, and involved 297 women: 98 ENG-implant users, 99 LNG-IUS users and 100 TCu380A IUD users.Women accepting each contraceptive method were randomized into two groups after the women chose their contraceptive method. Group I received routine counselling at the clinic, including information on safety, efficacy and side effects, as well as what to expect regarding bleeding disturbances. Group II received 'intensive counselling'. In addition to the information provided to those in Group I, these women also received leaflets on their chosen method and were seen by the same three professionals, the most experienced at the clinic, throughout the year of follow-up. These three professionals went over all the information provided at each consultation. Women in both groups were instructed to return to the clinic after 45 (±7) days and at 6 and 12 (±1) months after insertion. They were instructed to record all bleeding episodes on a menstrual calendar specifically provided for this purpose. Additionally, satisfaction with the method was evaluated by a questionnaire completed by the women after 12 months of use of the contraceptive method.There were no significant differences between the intensive and routine counselling groups on the discontinuation rates due to unpredictable menstrual bleeding of the three contraceptives under evaluation. The 1-year cumulative discontinuation rates due to menstrual bleeding irregularities were 2.1, 2.7 and 4.0% and the continuation rates were 82.6, 81.0 and 73.2%, for the ENG-implant, the LNG-IUS or the TCu380A IUD users, respectively. The main reasons for discontinuation of the methods were  gain in users of the ENG-implant and expulsion of the TCu380A.The main limitations are that we cannot assure generalization of the results to another settings and that the routine counselling provided by our counsellors may already be appropriate for the women attending the clinic and so consequently intensive counselling including written leaflets was unable to influence the premature discontinuation rate due to unpredictable menstrual bleeding. Additionally, counselling could discourage some women from using the LARC methods offered in the study and consequently those women may have decided on other contraceptives.Routine counselling may be sufficient for many women to help reduce premature discontinuation rates and improve continuation rates and user satisfaction among new users of LARC methods.The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov ().The study was partially funded by the Fundação de Apoio a Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) grant # 2012/01379-0, the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq) grant #573747/2008-3 and by Merck (MSD), Brazil under an unrestricted grant.

Alterations may include decreased glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance, which are risk factors for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. These issues have been raised primarily with contraceptives containing estrogen.To evaluate the effect of hormonal contraceptives on carbohydrate metabolism in healthy women and those at risk for diabetes due to overweight.In February 2012, we searched the computerized databases MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, and LILACS for studies of hormonal contraceptives and carbohydrate metabolism. We also searched for clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. Previous searches also included EMBASE.All randomized controlled trials were considered if they examined carbohydrate metabolism in women without diabetes who used hormonal contraceptives for contraception. Comparisons could be a placebo, a non-hormonal contraceptive, or another hormonal contraceptive that differed in drug, dosage, or regimen. Interventions included at least three cycles. Outcomes included glucose and insulin .We assessed all titles and abstracts identified during the literature searches. The data were extracted and entered into RevMan. We wrote to researchers for missing data. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio with 95% CI was calculated.We found 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. None included a placebo. Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome.Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from  COCs were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose (MD 0.20; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41). Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose (MD -0.40; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.08) and higher means for two-hour glucose response (MD 1.08; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71) and insulin area under the curve (AUC) (MD 20.30; 95% CI 4.24 to 36.36).Three trials examined the etonogestrel vaginal ring and one examined an etonogestrel implant. One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC insulin than the -COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38).Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables. In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a -COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). In an injectable study, a group using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had higher means than the group using norethisterone enanthate for fasting glucose (MD 10.05; 95% CI 3.16 to 16.94), glucose two-hour response (MD 17.00; 95% CI 5.67 to 28.33), and fasting insulin (MD 3.40; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.73).Among five recent trials, two examined newer COCs with different estrogen types. One showed the group with nomegestrel acetate plus 17β-estradiol had lower means than the  group for incremental AUC glucose (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.55 to -0.31) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02). Two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens. With a dienogest COC, an extended-use group had greater mean change in AUC glucose (MD 82.00; 95% CI 10.72 to 153.28). In a small trial using two  COCs, the lower-dose group showed smaller mean change in fasting glucose (MD -3.00; 95% CI -5.89 to -0.11), but the obese and normal  women did not differ significantly.Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without diabetes. We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods.We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had  restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by  mass index (obese versus normal).</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'insulin resistance', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2969320>Changes in lipoprotein composition in women receiving two low-dose oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol and gonane progestins.</a></h2><p>In a prospective double-blind study of the effects of two low-dose oral contraceptives (OCs) on  and lipoprotein , two groups of eighteen young healthy women selected at random were submitted to a six months' use of either monophasic ethinylestradiol (EE) + desogestrel (DG) or triphasic EE +  (LNG).

Cholesterol and apoproteins (A-I, A-II, B) composition of lipoproteins (HDL-2, HDL-3, LDL) isolated by ultracentrifugation were additionally determined. On Mono-EE + DG, plasma TG (+39.3%, +45.6%), PL (+21.9%, +16.8%) and apo A-I (+35.5%, +23.3%) levels were significantly increased at 3 and 6 months of use; plasma HDL-C (+24%) and Apo A-II (+21.4%) were transiently increased at 3 months.  and apoprotein composition of HDL-2, HDL-3 and LDL were unchanged. On Tri-EE + LNG, a slight but not significant decrease in HDL-C was observed throughout the study while other plasma lipids and apoproteins were unchanged. Ultracentrifugation revealed a lower content of C (-44.2%) and apo A-I (-44.6%) in HDL-2. LCAT activity expressed as molar esterification rate (MER) rose in a more sustained way during EE + DG use than during EE + LNG treatment.

However, the concomitant effects of COC and NO deficiency on the heart and glucose regulation are not well known. We therefore hypothesized that COC treatment during NO deficiency would lead to the development of cardiac hypertrophy that is associated with aggravated glucose deregulation, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic biomarkers. Eight-week-old female Wistar rats were randomly allotted into control, NO deficient (N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester: L-NAME; 20.0mg/kg b.w.), COC-treated (1.0μg ethinylestradiol+5.0μg , p.o) and L-NAME+COC-treated groups. The animals were treated daily for 6 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was estimated by tail-cuff plethysmography, insulin resistance (IR) and β-cell function were estimated by homeostatic model of assessment (HOMA-IR and HOMA-β). Pro-inflammatory (C-reactive protein; CRP and uric acid) and pro-fibrotic (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; PAI-1) biomarkers were estimated in the plasma. Cardiac histological examination was also done. Results show that COC or L-NAME treatments led to increased blood pressure, HOMA-IR, impaired β-cell function, PAI-1, CRP and uric acid, without significant effect on cardiac mass. L-NAME+COC-treated group had significantly higher blood pressure, HOMA-IR, impaired β-cell function, PAI-1, CRP and cardiac mass than COC- or L-NAME-treated groups. Histological examination validated that COC use during NO deficiency causes cardiac hypertrophy. The present study demonstrates that COC treatment and NO deficiency synergistically causes cardiac hypertrophy that is associated with aggravated glucose deregulation, atherogenic dyslipidemia, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In a private practice, 409 subjects participated in 7,286 treatment cycles. Three pregnancies occurred, all due to subject failure. Menstrual regulation was excellent and the incidence of side effects extremely low. Withdrawals from the study for possibly drug-related medical reasons totaled 9.0% through 56 cycles of treatment. Metabolic changes also were evaluated in 14 of these women over a 6-month period. The only statistically significant increase in carbohydrate values occurred at 6 months.

The main purpose of trials for the evaluation of new contraceptive methods is to test their effectiveness, and therefore only women below 38 years of age are accepted. Furthermore, when new methods are being tested, only healthy women are accepted, and those having health problems of almost any kind are excluded. Therefore our knowledge about the contraceptive methods in women over 40 years of age is scanty and comes from trials with a long-lasting follow-up on healthy women who can use the method without problems until they are 45 or reach menopause. We have very limited reported information on the use of contraceptives by women who have cardiovascular disease, , liver problems, etc. Therefore the main body of experience in this review comes from healthy women between 35 and 44. On the other hand, one should remember that these women have a high motivation to use contraceptive methods and therefore the continuation rate in the trials is high. This compensates for the relatively small number of acceptors by giving more women-years in follow-up. Continuation rate and the proper use of methods are directly correlated to increase in age, socioeconomical status, and to education of users. Highly educated women in this age group have very low failure rate with almost any method.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29917111> and Female Genital Tract : Time for a Closer Look.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12320011>Metabolic effects of oral contraceptives: fact vs. fiction.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28290977>Actinomyces-Related Tubo-Ovarian Abscess in a Poorly Controlled Type II Diabetic With a Copper Intrauterine Device.</a></h2><p>The historic association of Actinomyces israelii infection with intrauterine devices (IUDs) has long been recognized. In recent years, the risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease with a copper or  IUD has been less than 1% in women who are low risk for sexually transmitted infections. IUD-related pelvic infections secondary to actinomyces have largely vanished from contemporary practice.A 49-year-old using a copper IUD for contraception with poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus was admitted for suspected tubo-ovarian abscess on the basis of abdominopelvic pain, leukocytosis, and computed tomography findings. After she was treated with intravenous and outpatient antibiotics with clinical improvement, repeat imaging 1 month later revealed a persistent complex left adnexal mass. Tumor markers were negative but given the persistence and complex nature of the mass, surgical management was recommended. A robotic-assisted hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Adhesiolysis, profuse irrigation, and ureteral stenting were required. Pathology revealed bilateral tubo-ovarian abscesses with actinomyces species identified on intraoperative culture. The patient had a total of 10 days of postoperative antibiotics and improved glucose control with no further signs of infection.Although actinomyces-related IUD PID is considered an outdated diagnosis, there are intermittent case reports of bizarre presentations in older women, often mimicking malignancy. Actinomyces should be a consideration in tubo-ovarian abscesses or pelvic inflammatory disease in patients with an IUD in place, particularly those who have poor glucose control or are otherwise immunosuppressed. Early identification and treatment of actinomyces tubo-ovarian abscesses may reduce surgical morbidity and overall improve patient outcomes and safety.Reprint & Copyright © 2017 Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8513671>Fasting plasma lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins in Nigerian women using combined oral and progestin-only injectable contraceptives.</a></h2><p>Fasting plasma , lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein (apo) profiles were determined in Nigerian women using a low-dose combined oral (Lo-Feminal + Fe) (n = 18), a progestin-only injectable (Depo-Provera) (n = 16) contraceptives and matched controls (n = 18). The mean of plasma total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, apo B and Lp(a) were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in women using contraceptives than the controls.

In 1995 and 1996, three studies showed a difference in the risk of VTE with third-generation OCs containing the progestogens, desogestrel or gestodene, compared with earlier formulations. However, the subsequent MediPlus study did not show any difference in the risk of VTE between users of third- and second-generation OCs. To re-examine the risks of VTE with various OCs, a nested case-control study was undertaken using the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). This study identified 293 cases and selected up to four controls matched for year of birth, practice, and event date. Adjustment for confounding variables included: body mass index, smoking, asthma, diastolic blood pressure, and a proxy for recent illness. The new analysis of the GPRD showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of VTE among users of third-generation OCs compared with second-generation OCs containing  150 microg plus ethinylestradiol 30 microg. Important associations with idiopathic VTE included: age, , smoking, recent concurrent illness, and asthma.

Contraceptive efficacy and insertion and removal times were also recorded. Mean changes from baseline in the  and apolipoprotein parameters, although occasionally statistically significant, were small in all groups (less than 1 standard deviation of the mean concentration at baseline) and clinically not significant. Statistically significant differences between the Implanon and Norplant groups were only occasionally observed. In both implant groups, total mean cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein AI concentrations tended to decrease during the study, but statistically significant changes from baseline were only occasionally observed, suggesting that drug-related factors are not involved. The mean ratios of HDL/total cholesterol and the HDL/LDL cholesterol showed very little change over time in both implant groups; slight and statistically nonsignificant increases were noted at most time points. Similar changes were seen in the group of IUD users.

Novel delivery systems (e.g., contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, single-rod implantable device) may change traditional risk and benefit profiles in women with comorbidities. Effective contraceptive counseling requires an understanding of a woman's preferences and medical history, as well as the risks, benefits, adverse effects, and contraindications of each method. Noncontraceptive benefits of combined hormonal contraceptives, such as oral contraceptive pills, include regulated menses, decreased dysmenorrhea, and diminished premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Oral contraceptive pills may be used safely in women with a range of medical conditions, including well-controlled hypertension, uncomplicated diabetes mellitus, depression, and uncomplicated valvular heart disease. However, women older than 35 years who smoke should avoid oral contraceptive pills. Contraceptives containing estrogen, which can increase thrombotic risk, should be avoided in women with a history of venous thromboembolism, stroke, cardiovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease. Progestin-only contraceptives are recommended for women with contraindications to estrogen. Depo-Provera, a long-acting injectable contraceptive, may be preferred in women with sickle cell disease because it reduces the frequency of painful crises. Because of the interaction between antiepileptics and oral contraceptive pills, Depo-Provera may also be considered in women with epilepsy.

All three treatments showed similar suppression of serum progesterone, 17β-estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels.The 21/7-active low-dose COC regimen (DSG/EE+7 days EE) showed ovarian activity suppression that was similar to the 24/4 (DRSP/EE+4 days PBO) and 21/7 (LNG/EE+7days PBO) regimens.The 21/7-active low-dose COC regimen (DSG/EE+7 days EE) that included only EE during the traditional HFI showed suppression of ovarian follicular activity that was similar to the 24/4 (DRSP/EE+4days PBO) and the 21/7 (LNG/EE+7 days PBO) comparator regimens.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although mainly used for contraception, progestin can help treat menstrual disorders, and benign breast, uterine, and ovarian diseases. Breast cancer is the leading site of new, non-skin, cancers in females in the United States, and possible factors that may modulate breast cancer risk need to be identified. ProQuest (Ann Arbor, MI) and PubMed-Medline (US National Library of Medicine, Bethesda MD, USA) databases were used to search for epidemiologic studies from 2000 to 2015 that examined the association between progestin and breast cancer. Search terms included epidemiologic studies + progesterone or progestin or progestogen or contraceptive or contraceptive agents + breast cancer or breast neoplasms. A total of six studies were included in the review. Five of the six studies reported no association between progestin-only formulations (including norethindrone oral contraceptives, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, injectable,  system users, implantable and intrauterine devices) and breast cancer risk. Duration of use was examined in a few studies with heterogeneous results. Unlike studies of other oral contraceptives, studies indicate that progestin-only formulations do not increase the risk of breast cancer, although the literature is hampered by small sample sizes. Future research is needed to corroborate these findings, as further understanding of synthetic progesterone may initiate new prescription practices or guidelines for women's health.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340667>The fate of prazosin and  after electrochemical degradation process: Monitoring by-products using LC-TOF/MS.</a></h2><p>Prazosin (PRZ) and  (LNG) are widely used as an anti-disease drugs due to their biological activity in the human body. The frequent detection of these compounds in water samples requires alternative technologies for the removal of both compounds. After electrochemical degradation of PRZ and LNG, the parent compounds could be completely removed after treatment, but the identification and characterization of by-products are necessary as well. In this study, the effects of NaCl concentration and applied voltage were investigated during the electrochemical degradation process. The results revealed that the increase of NaCl concentration and applied voltage could promote the generation of hypochlorite OCl and then enhance the degradation of PRZ and LNG. After initial study, 6V and 0.2g NaCl were selected for further experiments (96% and 99% removal of PRZ and LNG after 40min, respectively).  consumption was also evaluated and calculated for PRZ and LNG at 3, 6 and 8V. Solid phase extraction (SPE) method plays an important role in enhancing the detection limit of by-products. Furthermore, characterization and identification of chlorinated and non-chlorinated by-products were conducted using an accurate liquid chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry LC-TOF/MS instrument. The monitoring of products during the electrochemical degradation process was performed at 6V and 0.2g NaCl in a 50mL solution. The results indicated that two chlorinated products were formed during the electrochemical process.

The effects of gender, genetic polymorphism, and drug-drug interaction on the metabolic profile of SR9009 were also evaluated. In vitro approaches were based on the use of human liver microsomes and cytochrome P450 isoforms. Sample preparation included an enzymatic hydrolysis (performed only for the phase II investigation) followed by liquid-liquid extraction. The chromatographic separation was carried out using a reverse-phase column; detection was performed by either a triple-quadrupole or a time-of-flight system in positive electrospray ionization and different acquisition modes. In the presence of human liver microsomes, SR9009 was biotransformed to 13 metabolites by CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 isoenzymes. The reactions included hydroxylation, de-alkylation, oxidation, and combinations thereof, the de-alkylated metabolites being the most abundant. Once formed the mentioned metabolites underwent glucuronidation. Concerning the effects of gender, genetic polymorphism, and drug-drug interaction on the metabolic profile of SR9009, our observation have shown the following: (a) No significant alterations were measured between female and male, (b) significant differences were registered using either the CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 allelic variants, and finally (c) significant alterations were registered in the presence of ketoconazole, miconazole, fluoxetine, nefazodone and paroxetine; moderate variation were instead registered with fluconazole, itraconazole, gestodene, and .

The trial was completed by 137 subjects. Protocol violations occurred in 38 cases. Thirty-five subjects dropped out during the study, 21 of them because of adverse events. Both treatments were equally effective in the treatment of climacteric complaints. There were no clinically significant changes in body weight, blood pressure, haematological tests, and parameters of clinical chemistry. There was a tendency towards a reduction in bleeding intensity in both groups in the second half of the treatment period. The treatment for six cycles with both regimens significantly (P < 0.05) decreased plasma concentrations of triglycerides (significant in the low- group only), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-3-cholesterol, lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein A1. In parallel, the serum concentration of total cholesterol increased significantly in both treatment groups, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly in the high- group only. The changes in high-density lipoprotein-2-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B did not reach statistical significance.It can be concluded that both sequential combined oral hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimens were equivalent with respect to efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of women with climacteric complaints.

An untreated control group of 30 postmenopausal women not seeking HRT was also studied. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) were performed at baseline and 3, 6, and 18 months later. Mathematical modeling analysis of plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentration profiles provided measures of insulin resistance, secretion, and elimination. There were no changes in glucose or insulin concentrations with transdermal therapy. Oral therapy caused a deterioration of glucose tolerance and an increased overall plasma insulin response, apparently due to a reduction in the immediate plasma insulin response to glucose. This may have resulted from increased hepatic insulin uptake, uncompensated for by an increase in first-phase pancreatic insulin secretion. Neither treatment caused significant insulin resistance compared with baseline, but with the oral treatment insulin resistance was greater during the combined phase compared with the estrogen-only phase. Thus the oral regimen affected both insulin delivery and insulin resistance. The transdermal regimen had relatively few effects on insulin metabolism.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28476823>Prediction of Relapse After Therapy Withdrawal in Women with Endometrial Hyperplasia: A Long-term Follow-up Study.</a></h2><p>To investigate whether risk of relapse of endometrial hyperplasia persists many years after successful primary therapy and whether clinical or biological markers observed at primary diagnosis may predict relapse.A series of 57 women with endometrial hyperplasia received -impregnated intrauterine system or oral progestin for three months during 1998-2000. Index biopsies were classified according to WHO1994 and D-score systems, and immunohistochemical staining for estrogen receptor α (ERα), estrogen receptor β (ERβ), progesterone receptor A (PRA), progesterone receptor B (PRB), B-cell lymphoma 2/apoptosis regulator (BCL2), BCL2-associated X protein/apoptosis regulator (BAX), paired box 2 (PAX2), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) reported as H-scores.Over a follow-up of 157.8 months, 23% (10/43) of patients experienced relapse. No correlation with age, body mass index, parity, WHO94 classification, or D-score was found. Only PRA (p=0.004) and PRB (p=0.038) showed certain correlation with relapse.Endometrial hyperplasia recurs many years after successful progestin therapy. Increased expression of PRB and reduced expression of PRA significantly correlated with relapse.

They pose a problem to many women just like the clinical picture of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) with , hirsutism, acne and amenorrhea. The aim of this study was to evaluate androgenicity of the most used progestogens with special reference to desogestrel which is a new progestogen. Radioimmunoassay was used for hormone determination while serum proteins were determined with electroimmunoassay or in some studies for sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) with capacity assays. Serum lipids and lipoproteins were determined in serum and after ultracentrifugation in HDL, LDL and VLDL fractions. In a comparative study on /ethinylestradiol (EE) (n = 10) versus desogestrel/ethinylestradiol (n = 10) the latter combination gave increases in SHBG capacity while the former did not. Similar increases in estrogen-sensitive proteins cortisol binding globulin (CBG) and ceruloplasmin indicated that the estrogenicity and "antiestrogenicity" was the same for the two combinations whereas the androgenicity of  was greater giving a reduction in the EE-induced increase in SHBG (SHBG is increased by estrogens and suppressed by androgens). When giving desogestrel 0.125-0.500 mg and lynestrenol 5 mg alone in daily doses to a group of regularly menstruating women (n = 8) strong suppression of SHBG was achieved while ceruloplasmin, CBG and thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) did not change. TBG is decreased and prealbumin increased by androgenic/anabolic activity but only a moderate increase in prealbumin was found during lynestrenol treatment. The changes in SHBG are probably the result of a dose-dependent receptor interaction related to 17 alpha-alkylation in 19-norsteroids. Twenty women with PCO were treated for 8 months with 0.150 mg desogestrel/0.030 mg EE. Evaluation was done before treatment and after 3 and 8 "pill" cycles regarding androgens, estradiol, SHBG, hirsutism and body weight. Spontaneous menstrual cycles were assessed after treatment. Serum lipids and lipoproteins were studied before treatment and at the end of the third "cycle". In PCO the suppression of increased total and free testosterone levels (in comparison to 22 healthy women) was evident during treatment, concordant with increases in SHBG capacity. Hirsutism was suppressed and body weight was reduced in obese women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091920>A novel intravaginal ring to prevent HIV-1, HSV-2, HPV, and unintended pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Women urgently need a self-initiated, multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) that simultaneously reduces their risk of acquiring HIV-1, HSV-2, and HPV (latter two associated with increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition) and prevents unintended pregnancy. Here, we describe a novel core-matrix intravaginal ring (IVR), the MZCL IVR, which effectively delivered the MZC combination microbicide and a contraceptive. The MZCL IVR contains four active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs): MIV-150 (targets HIV-1), zinc acetate (ZA; targets HIV-1 and HSV-2), carrageenan (CG; targets HPV and HSV-2), and  (LNG; targets unintended pregnancy). The elastomeric IVR body (matrix) was produced by hot melt extrusion of the non-water swellable elastomer, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA-28), containing the hydrophobic small molecules, MIV-150 and LNG. The solid hydrophilic core, embedded within the IVR by compression, contained the small molecule ZA and the macromolecule CG. Hydrated ZA/CG from the core was released by diffusion via a pore on the IVR while the MIV-150/LNG diffused from the matrix continuously for 94 days (d) in vitro and up to 28 d (study period) in macaques. The APIs released in vitro and in vivo were active against HIV-1ADA-M, HSV-2, and HPV16 PsV in cell-based assays. Serum LNG was at levels associated with local contraceptive effects. The results demonstrate proof-of-concept of a novel core-matrix IVR for sustained and simultaneous delivery of diverse molecules for the prevention of HIV, HSV-2 and HPV acquisition, as well as unintended pregnancy.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Ovulation suppression was seen in 81.8% (95% CI: 73.3%, 88.5%) and 86.1% (95% CI: 78.1%, 92%) of treatment cycles with low and high-dose, respectively. Benign progesterone receptor modulator associated endometrial changes (PAEC) were seen during treatment; 78.8% at week 24, but resolved at recovery cycle. A few cases of heavy bleeding occurred near the end of the 24-week treatment, but a single dose of LNG every 12 weeks reduced the increase in endometrial thickness during the second treatment period and prevented excessive bleeding.The 3-month UPA-CVR may become an effective long-acting, user-controlled estrogen-free contraceptive. The greatest suppression of ovulation was seen with the 2500-μg/day ring.The 3-month CVR delivering UPA 2500 μg/day can become an effective user-controlled estrogen-free contraceptive method.

The incorporation of drug adsorbates onto crospovidone into the polyisobutene blends yielded crystal-free patches. The drug release from these patches was independent of polyisobutene's molecular  distribution, probably because the drug release occurred mainly through fluid filled channels. By contrast, the drug release from acrylic adhesives was independent of whether the patches contained pure drugs or drug adsorbates onto crospovidone. A higher degree of saturation (or supersaturation) in these systems resulted in a higher thermodynamic activity of the drugs and hence a higher drug release. The crystal-free acrylic and polyisobutene patches did not show drug recrystallization after 3 months at 25°C/60 RH and 40°C/75 RH. The adhesive properties of polyisobutene patches were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The area under the curve of force-distance curves recorded with the texture analyzer correlated well with the in vivo skin adhesion.

This article explains and summarizes these considerations and provides an algorithm to guide clinicians.© 2017 AWHONN, the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8746877>Intrauterine administration of  in two low doses in HRT.

The mass-transfer resistance depends on the particle size but some practical limits exist not to reach the theoretically expected plate height and mass-transfer resistance. Another approach applies particles with shortened diffusion path to enhance the efficiency of separations. In this study a systematical evaluation of the possibilities of the separations obtained with 5 cm long narrow bore columns packed with new 2.6 microm shell particles (1.9 microm nonporous core surrounded by a 0.35 microm porous shell, Kinetex, Core-Shell), packed with other shell-type particles (Ascentis Express, Fused-Core), totally porous sub-2 microm particles and a 5 cm long narrow bore monolith column is presented. The different commercially available columns were compared by using van Deemter, Knox and kinetic plots. Theoretical Poppe plots were constructed for each column to compare their kinetic performance. Data are presented on polar neutral real-life analytes. Comparison of a low molecular  compounds (MW=270-430) and a high molecular  one (MW approximately 900) was conducted. This study proves that the Kinetex column packed with 2.6 microm shell particles is worthy of rivaling to sub-2 microm columns and other commercially available shell-type packings (Ascentis Express or Halo), both for small and large molecule separation. The Kinetex column offers a very flat C term.

However, adverse effects associated with OCs use notably the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), manifesting as ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) and venous thromboembolic diseases were reported soon after their introduction to the market in the early 1960s. Various modifications were made in an attempt to lower these risks including a reduction in the estrogen dose and changes in the progestogen compound. Currently used OCs containing the new progestin (, Desogestrel, gestodene or norgestimate) classified as low dose because all contain less than 35 microg of ethinyl estradiol. Despite their low steroid content, all have proved to be highly effective. The rationale of this reviewed study based upon cardiovascular risks in relation to these monophasic low-dose oral contraceptives. To review all relevant articles it is concluded that the risk for cardiovascular disease is lower with current preparations of oral contraceptives. Cardiovascular diseases occur mainly among oral contraceptive users who smoke or have predisposing factors--such as age more than 35 years, overweight,  & hypertension.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491593>Additive effects of  and ethinylestradiol on brain aromatase (cyp19a1b) in zebrafish specific in vitro and in vivo bioassays.</a></h2><p>Estrogens and progestins are widely used in combination in human medicine and both are present in aquatic environment. Despite the joint exposure of aquatic wildlife to estrogens and progestins, very little information is available on their combined effects. In the present study we investigated the effect of ethinylestradiol (EE2) and  (LNG), alone and in mixtures, on the expression of the brain specific ER-regulated cyp19a1b gene. For that purpose, recently established zebrafish-derived tools were used: (i) an in vitro transient reporter gene assay in a human glial cell line (U251-MG) co-transfected with zebrafish estrogen receptors (zfERs) and the luciferase gene under the control of the zebrafish cyp19a1b gene promoter and (ii) an in vivo bioassay using a transgenic zebrafish expressing GFP under the control of the zebrafish cyp19a1b gene promoter (cyp19a1b-GFP). Concentration-response relationships for single chemicals were modeled and used to design the mixture experiments following a ray design. The results from mixture experiments were analyzed to predict joint effects according to concentration addition and statistical approaches were used to characterize the potential interactions between the components of the mixtures (synergism/antagonism). We confirmed that some progestins could elicit estrogenic effects in fish brain. In mixtures, EE2 and LNG exerted additive estrogenic effects both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that some environmental progestin could exert effects that will add to those of environmental (xeno-)estrogens. Moreover, our zebrafish specific assays are valuable tools that could be used in risk assessment for both single chemicals and their mixtures.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A cohort of 248 women presenting for -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) insertion or reinsertion were stratified according to their current contraceptive method. Information concerning their menstrual pattern and data about the medical history were collected. The composition of their vaginal microflora was studied by detailed phase contrast microscopy of fresh vaginal fluid, and aerobic cultures were taken to detect enteric bacterial growth and fungal colonisation. LNG-IUS and progesterone-only-pill (POP) users had significantly lower blood loss (p < 0.001) than other women. Regardless of the type of contraception used, all women reported similar rates of symptomatic lower genital tract infection during the preceding year. Women using combined oral contraception (COC) and long-term LNG-IUS had the same bacterial composition of vaginal microflora as non-contraceptive users, even when infections were combined. Both hormonal and non-hormonal intrauterine device users had an increased tendency to have more vaginal colonisation with Candida. Women on POPs or subcutaneous implants had a tendency towards increased vaginal atrophy, but had a lower Candida carriage rate compared to IUCD users (LNG-IUS and Copper-IUCD, p = 0.037). Women with an increased risk of acquiring STIs or recurrent BV could benefit from LNG-IUS or COC due to a well-preserved vaginal bacterial flora.

Four phase 1 studies were conducted in healthy subjects to evaluate the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between mirabegron and metformin, warfarin, digoxin, or a combination oral contraceptive (COC).Thirty-two male subjects received metformin (500 mg twice daily) or mirabegron (160 mg once daily) alone, in combination or with placebo. Twenty-four male and female subjects received single doses of warfarin (25 mg) alone and in combination with mirabegron (100 mg once daily).

Absence of a Pharmacokinetic interaction was concluded if the 90 % confidence intervals (CI) of geometric least-squares means ratio of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C ) were contained within the standard 80-125 % no-effect boundaries. The effect of mirabegron on warfarin International Normalized Ratio (INR) was also assessed.Mirabegron increased digoxin AUC and C by 27 and 29 %, respectively, indicating that mirabegron is a weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vivo. Co-administration of mirabegron did not affect the pharmacokinetics of metformin, warfarin, EE and LNG, or warfarin INR, except for a slight extension of the 90 % CI for the C  ratio for metformin (lower limit 79 %). Metformin decreased mirabegron AUC and C  by 21 %.

We aimed to quantify this risk considering both progestogen type and estrogen dose.PubMed, Embase and LIVIVO were searched for relevant publications until April 2017. Case-control and cohort studies including healthy women taking COC and assessing incident VTE as outcome were selected. Adjusted relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) derived from random effects model using a generic inverse-variance approach are reported.Overall, 1,359 references were identified and 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled RR of VTE was associated with various COC, with the association depending on their respective estrogen dose and progestogen type. Compared to the reference,  with 30-40 μg ethinylestradiol, the overall risk of VTE was higher for all other COC. Preparations with desogestrel with 30-40 μg estrogen showed the highest relative risk (RR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.33-1.59), while RRs for drospirenone (30-40 μg ethinylestradiol) and desogestrel (30-40/20 μg ethinylestradiol) were lower.

The aim of this study was to determine the plasma concentration of LNG and its variation with time in patients with in-dwelling LNG-IUS Mirena®.In this study, we determined LNG plasma concentrations in 110 women with LNG-IUS at different time points of use. Time from insertion of the system in the study population ranged from 20 days to 11.1 years. Quantitative LNG levels were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay.The mean±SD LNG plasma level in all women was 147±59 pg/mL. A highly significant negative correlation between LNG plasma level and LNG-IUS time of use could be demonstrated. In the first year of use, LNG plasma level was as high as 191±71 pg/mL, decreasing to 157±68 pg/mL in the second year and 134±41 pg/mL in the third year. Even after exceeding the recommended period of LNG-IUS use, systemic LNG concentrations were detectable: 133±38 pg/mL in the sixth year, 133±48 pg/mL in the seventh year and 117±45 pg/mL in the eighth year. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation between LNG plasma level and  mass index could be shown.Systemic LNG concentrations can be found in all patients with LNG-IUS IUS. However, concentrations are much lower than in other forms of LNG application.

We computed the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous variables. For dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated.We found 16 studies; one examined progestin-only pills, one studied the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), four examined an implant, and 10 focused on depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). Outcomes examined were changes in  only (14 studies), changes in both  and  composition (1 study), and changes in  composition only (1 study). We did not conduct meta-analysis due to the various contraceptive methods and  change .Comparison groups did not differ significantly for  change in 12 studies. However, three studies showed  change differences for POC users compared to women not using a hormonal method. In one study,  gain (kg) was greater for the DMPA group than the group using a non-hormonal IUD in years one through three [(MD 2.28; 95% CI 1.79 to 2.77), (MD 2.71, 95% CI 2.12 to 3.30), and (MD 3.17; 95% CI 2.51 to 3.83), respectively]. The differences were notable within the normal  and overweight subgroups. Two implant studies also showed differences in  change. The implant group (six-capsule) had greater  gain (kg) compared to the group using a non-hormonal IUD in both studies [(MD 0.47 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.65); (MD 1.10; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84)]. In one of those studies, the implant group also had greater  gain than a group using a barrier method or no contraceptive (MD 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96).The two studies that assessed  composition change showed differences between POC users and women not using a hormonal method. Adolescents using DMPA had a greater increase in  fat (%) compared to a group not using a hormonal method (MD 11.00; 95% CI 2.64 to 19.36). The DMPA group also had a greater decrease in lean  mass (%) (MD -4.00; 95% CI -6.93 to -1.07). The other study reported differences between an LNG-IUS group and a non-hormonal IUD group in percent change in  fat mass (2.5% versus -1.3%, respectively; reported P value = 0.029) and percent change in lean  mass (-1.4% versus 1.0%, respectively; reported P value = 0.027).The overall quality of evidence was moderate to low, given that the studies were evenly divided across the evidence quality groups (high, moderate, low, or very low quality). We found limited evidence of  gain when using POCs. Mean gain was less than 2 kg for most studies up to 12 months.  change for the POC group generally did not differ significantly from that of the comparison group using another contraceptive. Two studies that assessed  composition showed that POC users had greater increases in  fat and decreases in lean  mass compared to users of non-hormonal methods.

Herein, we assessed oviductal glycoprotein 1 (OVGP1) in the macaque cervix as a marker for progestogen action.Rhesus macaques were treated with estradiol (E ), E plus progesterone (P), and E plus  (LNG), a contraceptive progestin. Samples consisted of archived blocks of midcervix mucosa (epithelium and lamina propria) and fresh epithelial cells collected non-invasively by cytobrush. OVGP1 was assayed by quantitative real-time PCR and localized by immunocytochemistry.OVGP1 transcript was maximal after E and reduced after treatment with E  + P (P < .05). LNG also reduced OVGP1 expression (P < .05). OVGP1-specific staining localized to epithelial cells, and transcript was quantifiable in cytobrush collected samples.OVGP1 expression in cytobrush samples of macaque cervix provides a non-invasive indicator of contraceptive progestin action.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Randomization was to a control group (higher-dose oral contraceptive [OCP] 35 microg ethinyl estradiol [EE]/2 mg cyproterone acetate, metformin [1 g b.d.] or low-dose OCP [20 microg EE/100 microg  + aldactone 50 mg b.d.]). Primary outcome  were insulin resistance (area under curve on oral glucose tolerance test) and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease including arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and endothelial function.All treatments similarly and significantly improved symptoms including hirsutism and menstrual cycle length. Insulin resistance was improved by metformin and worsened by the high-dose OCP. Arterial stiffness worsened in the higher-dose OCP group (PWV 7.46 vs. 8.03 m/s, P < 0.05), related primarily to the increased insulin resistance.In overweight women with PCOS, metformin and low- and high-dose OCP preparations have similar efficacy but differential effects on insulin resistance and arterial function. These findings suggest that a low-dose OCP preparation may be preferable if contraception is needed and that metformin should be considered for symptomatic management, particularly in women with additional metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'insulin resistance', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11368985>Implanon contraceptive implants: effects on carbohydrate metabolism.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to assess the possible differences in effects of Implanon and Norplant implants on carbohydrate metabolism.

There was a significant increase in the area under the curve for both glucose and  during OGTT within each group with increasing duration of use. However, there was no significant change in the fasting plasma glucose values. There was no significant difference in the carbohydrate parameters between the two groups during implant use, except for a minimal but statistically significant rise in fasting glycosylated hemoglobin A(1)C levels at 24 months in the Implanon group.

COC containing drospirenone (DRSP) is an analog of spironolactone, hence its antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic characteristics have been deemed beneficial, although the benefits and/or negative outcome of its usage have not been fully elucidated. We therefore hypothesized that COC with DRSP component will not affect glucose regulation and circulating corticosterone. Method Ten-week-old female Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control (CON), ethinylestradiol/drospirenone COC (EE/DRSP)-treated, and ethinylestradiol/ COC (EE/LN)-treated rats. The treatment lasted for 8 weeks. Results Results showed that with the exception of lipid profiles, EE/LN but not EE/DRSP COC treatment affected , glucose tolerance, plasma insulin, corticosterone, (IR), and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Conclusion Taken together, the findings showed that the beneficial effect of EE/DRSP could possibly be through the DRSP component. The result also implies that COCs containing DRSP may be a better and safer means of contraception than those with LN with less cardiovascular risks.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29050708>Hypercupremia secondary to oral contraceptives: report of 2 cases.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23134558>Efficacy of the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in the prevention of the atypical endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer: retrospective data from selected obese menopausal symptomatic women.</a></h2><p>The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of  intrauterine system-releasing (LNG-IUS) insertion in preventing atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AH) and endometrial cancer (EC) in symptomatic postmenopausal overweight/obese women. A total of 34 overweight/obese postmenopausal women, presenting abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and endometrial hyperplasia (EH), and who were submitted to LNG-IUS insertion, were identified from registry data. Endometrial histology at LNG-IUS insertion showed simple EH in 20 cases (58.8%), complex EH in 14 cases (41.2%). At 36 months, 91% of patients showed no recurrence of AUB and a significant reduction in the mean endometrial thickness (from 8.2 ± 2.2 to 3.2 ± 1.5 mm, p < 0.05) was observed. Histologic regression of EH was observed in 27 (79.4%) and 33 (97.5%) cases at 12 and 36 months, respectively. None of the women in which EH persisted, reported cellular atypia or cancer progression at 12 and 36 months of follow-up.

It appears that venous risk is attributable to subtle changes in clotting factors, while arterial risk may be secondary to changes in glucose and . In order to determine which women are at greatest risk from oral contraceptive use, Spellacy et al. has developed a risk scoring form that aids in the screening process. After excluding women with an absolute contraindication to pill use, women at greatest risk for cardiovascular disease related to oral contraceptive use are those with a family history of hyperlipidemia, gestational or overt diabetics, hypertensives, and smokers over the age of 35. The gradual reduction by manufacturers of the steroid content of oral contraceptives appears to have lessened the incidence of adverse effects. Our current knowledge of risk factors permits the clinician to reduce exposure to oral contraceptive-related mortality by as much as 86 per cent. As we continue to search for ways to reduce risk among oral contraceptive users, it is important to note that more than 25 per cent of women are still taking formulations containing 50 micrograms of estrogen. It becomes the responsibility of the practicing physician to "step-down" these patients to lower-dose preparations such as the multiphasics.

To date, evidence of their long-term efficiency is available. The aim of the present paper was to briefly review beneficial prophylactic effects of the -releasing intrauterine system on the incidence of a variety of malignancies in women. Such an influence is of a particular importance in the light of the currently observed increased prevalence of endometrial and cervical adenocarcinomas. Low-dose releasing intrauterine systems are also available, but the hard evidence-based medical data have been derived primarily for Mirena® (Bayer) device, which topically releases from 20 to 14 pg of  daily. Consequently the risk of developing endometrial carcinoma in Mirena® users is lowered by as much as 50% compared with the general population risk To a lesser extent, the intrauterine system decreases the risk for cervical adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, as well as ovarian, pancreas, and lung carcinomas. In one population-based study Mirena® increased the risk for breast carcinoma by approximately 20%, whereas a number of other studies failed to demonstrate such a hazard. In the recent decades of the increased predominance of insulin resistance and  and an occurrence of hormone-dependent carcinomas at earlier age, a broad application of -releasing intrauterine systems may become a particularly important component of primary prevention of malignancies in women.

These new implants offer easier insertion and removal and other advantages depending on the type of progestin. Implants prevent pregnancy by several mechanisms, including inhibition of ovulation and luteal function and alteration of cervical mucus and the endometrium. The high efficacy and ease of maintenance make implants an ideal contraceptive for many women, including adolescents, a population that uses implants infrequently but reports high satisfaction. Implants are appropriate for women who are breastfeeding, who have contraindications to estrogen, or who have diseases such as , hypertension, sickle cell anemia, or an HIV infection because implants have few metabolic or hematologic effects. Long-term use has not been associated with a decrease in BMD and generally leads to increased blood levels and iron stores. Women who wish to space their pregnancies appreciate the nearly immediate onset of action with insertion and the rapid termination of all effects with removal. All types of implants lead to menstrual changes and other side effects in some women. Adverse effects that occur in implant users more than the general population include headaches and acne. Women must be thoroughly counseled regarding the potential for menstrual alteration, side effects, and sexually transmitted infections if they do not use condoms. Despite their initial high cost, implants are a cost-effective method over several years, even when discontinued before the life of the implant.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25385099>Effect of the hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor faldaprevir on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and  in healthy female volunteers.</a></h2><p>Faldaprevir is a potent hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor.

In period 1, subjects received EE/LNG once daily (QD) for 14 days. Blood samples were taken on days 1, 11, and 12, with intensive PK blood sampling for EE and LNG on day 13. In period 2, subjects received EE-LNG QD and 240 mg faldaprevir QD on days 14 to 21 (240 mg faldaprevir twice daily on day 14). Blood samples were taken on days 14, 19, and 20, with PK profiling samples obtained for EE and LNG on day 21. A total of 15/16 subjects completed the study. Overall, EE and LNG exposure (assessed by the area under the curve) was approximately 1.4-fold higher when EE and LNG were coadministered with faldaprevir than when administered alone. Median t1/2 (terminal half-life in plasma at steady state) values were prolonged for both EE (2.4 h longer) and LNG (4.7 h longer) when EE and LNG were coadministered with faldaprevir. The mean oral clearance and apparent volume of distribution of both EE and LNG were lower (∼ 30%) when EE and LNG were coadministered with faldaprevir. Coadministration of faldaprevir and an oral contraceptive resulted in a moderate increase in exposure to both EE and LNG. However, this increase was not considered clinically meaningful, and no dose adjustment of oral contraceptives was deemed necessary.

Androgens, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) were measured, and free testosterone and the free testosterone index were calculated. Subjects discontinued oral contraceptive use for at least one menstrual cycle before being randomized to receive five cycles of ethinyl estradiol (EE) combined with either  (EE/LNG group) or drospirenone (EE/DRSP group) together with either dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (50 mg/day orally) or placebo. Subsequently, all subjects crossed over to the other treatment arm for an additional five cycles.Both COCs decreased the levels of all androgens measured. Significant decreases (p<.05) were found with EE/LNG and EE/DRSP for total testosterone (54.5% and 11.3%, respectively) and for free testosterone (66.8% and 75.6%, respectively). Adding DHEA to the COCs significantly increased all androgens compared to placebo. Moreover, including DHEA restored free testosterone levels to baseline values in both COC groups and total testosterone levels to baseline in the EE/LNG group and above baseline in the EE/DRSP group. SHBG concentrations were significantly higher with EE/DRSP compared to EE/LNG (p<.0001). The addition of DHEA did not affect the levels of SHBG.Taking COCs reduces total and free testosterone levels and increases SHBG concentrations. By coadministration with DHEA, physiological levels of total and free testosterone are restored while using EE/LNG. With EE/DRSP, only the free testosterone level is normalized by DHEA coadministration.A daily oral dose of 50-mg DHEA maintains physiological free and total testosterone levels in women who are using an EE/LNG-containing COC.Copyright © 2016 Pantarhei Bioscience.

Very small structural changes in the parent molecule may induce considerable differences in the activity of the derivative. In hormonal contraceptives, progestins represent the major agent designed for suppressing ovulation and are used in combination with estrogen (E) usually ethinyl-estradiol (EE). The development of new generations of progestins with improved selectivity profiles has been a great challenge. Steroidal and nonsteroidal progesterone receptor (PR) agonists have been synthesized as well, although the latter are still in a very early stage of development. Several new progestins, have been synthesized in the last two decades. These include dienogest (DNG), drospirenone (DRSP), Nestorone (NES), nomegestrol acetate (NOMAc) and trimegestone (TMG). These new progestins have been designed to have no androgenic or estrogenic actions and to be closer in activity to the physiological hormone P. DRSP differs from the classic progestins as it is derived from spirolactone. It is essentially an antimineralocorticoid steroid with no androgenic effect but a partial antiandrogenic effect. The antiovulatory potency of the different progestins varies. TMG and NES are the most potent progestins synthesized to date, followed by two of the older progestins, keto-desogestrel (keto-DSG) and  (LNG). The new molecules TMG, DRSP and DNG also have antiandrogenic activity. Striking differences exist regarding the side effects among the progestins and the combination with EE leads to other reactions related to the E itself and whether the associated progestin counterbalances, more or less, the estrogenic action. The 19-norprogesterone molecules and the new molecules DRSP and DNG are not androgenic and, therefore, have no negative effect on the  profile. Given their pharmacological properties, it is likely that the new progestins may have neutral effects on metabolic or vascular risks. However, this hypothesis must be confirmed in large clinical trials.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30392989>[Contraception for adolescent : CNGOF Contraception guidelines].</a></h2><p>The goal is to establish dialogue and determine the needs and skill levels of adolescence.

Progesterone acts physiologically to counteract the proliferative effects of estradiol during the menstrual cycle. In MHT, progestogens protect the endometrium against the proliferative effects of estrogens in women with a uterus. Recent data suggest that, whereas micronized progesterone is apparently safer for the breast, it could be less efficient than synthetic progestin on the endometrium.

The management of these patients is still controversial. Few clinical studies focusing on medical or surgical treatment for adenomyosis have been performed. No drug is currently labelled for adenomyosis and there are no specific guidelines to follow for the best management. Anyhow, medical treatments are effective in improving symptoms (pain, abnormal uterine bleeding and infertility). The rationale for using medical treatment is based on the pathogenetic mechanisms of adenomyosis: sex steroid hormones aberrations, impaired apoptosis, and increased inflammation. Several nonhormonal (i.e., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and hormonal treatments (i.e., progestins, oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues) are currently used off-label to control pain symptoms and abnormal uterine bleeding in adenomyosis. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues are indicated before fertility treatments to improve the chances of pregnancy in infertile women with adenomyosis. An antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effect of progestins, such as dienogest, danazol and norethindrone acetate, suggests their use in medical management of adenomyosis mainly to control pain symptoms. On the other hand, the intrauterine device releasing  resulted is extremely effective in resolving abnormal uterine bleeding and reducing uterine volume in a long-term management plan. Based on new findings on pathogenetic mechanisms, new drugs are under development for the treatment of adenomyosis, such as selective progesterone receptor modulators, aromatase inhibitors, valproic acid, and anti-platelets therapy.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

On day 12 of each cycle, subjects began a 10-day regimen of solifenacin 10 mg QD, which is 2 times the suggested starting dose, or placebo. Subjects crossed over to the other treatment arm for the second cycle. Primary PK end points were C(max) and AUC from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC(0-24 h)) for EE and LNG. Women ranged in age from 20 to 37 years and had a mean  of 64 kg, mean height of 167.4 cm, and mean  mass index of 23 kg/m2. Seven women had never smoked, while 5 were former smokers and 12 were regular smokers. Safety assessments included the nature, frequency, and severity of spontaneously reported or observed adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram, laboratory values, and physical examination.Statistical analysis of AUC(0-24 h)/product of baseline concentration and total blood sampling time, and C(max)/baseline concentration ratios of solifenacin versus placebo for EE and LNG found the 90% CI to be within the predefined range of 0.8 to 1.25 (EE: 0.854-1.164 and 0.822-1.167; LNG: 0.920-1.125 and 0.910-1.139). The number of samples with non-quantifiable luteinizing hormone (LH) and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) levels were comparable after administration of the OC with either solifenacin or placebo. The adverse event most frequently reported was dry mouth (solifenacin, n = 25 [9 mild, 13 moderate, and 3 severe] vs placebo, n = 1 [moderate]).

A simple, cheap and accessible electrospinning method was employed to prepare a water stable CH3MOF-5/PAN composite. The nanofibers were packed into the mini-disc cartridges to be used as SPE devices. They were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and N2 adsorption-desorption experiments. The effects of different parameters influencing the extraction efficiency including the type of eluent and its volume, the amount of the sorbent, pH, the ionic strength, the sample volume and the reusability of the sorbent were investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the linearity varied in range of 0.05-100μgL(-1) with R(2) values higher than 0.999. The limit of detection for both of the analytes was 0.02μgL(-1). The applicability of the method was examined by analyzing the analytes in the urine samples. The recovery of the analytes varied in the range of 82.8-94.8% which shows capability of the method for the determination of the drugs in the urine samples.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

An international perspective.</a></h2><p>The most frequent major adverse effect of hormonal contraception is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The effect on the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) differs and is strongly influenced by smoking and the presence of other cardiovascular risks factors, such as hypertension and . The incidence of each disease rises with age and there are differences in risk among hormonal contraceptive preparations. This article provides a framework within which to assess the balance of risks among types of hormonal contraceptives according to individual circumstances. Data on cardiovascular disease mortality rates in women of reproductive age in different countries of the world were compiled from nationally reported statistics and supplemented where possible with reported disease incidence rates. Risks associated with current use of hormonal contraception were compiled from the most recent publications on the cardiovascular effects of steroid hormone contraception. These were combined to estimate the total cardiovascular incidence and mortality according to baseline cardiovascular risk and individual characteristics. Mortality rates for cardiovascular diseases are very low in women of reproductive age. Myocardial infarction mortality rates rise from < 0.4 per 100,000 woman-years at age 15-24 years to the range 2 to 7 per 100,000 woman-years at age 35-44 years. Stroke mortality rates similarly rise steeply with age and are between 3 and 5 times higher than those for MI. VTE mortality rates rise less steeply with age and are approximately one-tenth the MI mortality rates at age 35-44 years. The adverse effect of oral contraceptives (OC) on the risk of VTE is the most important contributor to the total number of cardiovascular cases attributable to OC use. The increased risk of stroke and MI dominate the patterns of mortality in OC users and smokers. The additional risks attributable to smoking are greater than the additional risks attributable to OC use. The risk attributable to OC use in women < 35 years of age is small, even if they smoke, but there are substantially increased risks in older women who both smoke and use OC. The additional mortality attributable to OC use can be reduced by screening users, as this results in lower relative risks of ischemic stroke and MI. Differences between OC types in the relative risk of VTE contribute little to the total cardiovascular mortality associated with OC use, even though the total number of cardiovascular events is increased. A potential reduction in the risk of MI with desogestrel and gestodene compared with -containing OC would have little difference on overall mortality rates in women in their 20s and 30s, but may result in a net reduction in OC-attributable mortality in women aged 40-44 years who smoke. An overall quantification of the risks for different types of oral contraceptive users is necessary for an informed choice of contraceptive method, and any assessment of the balance of cardiovascular risks is complex. The model provides a tool to assess, at the level of the individual, the risks associated with use of different OC according to personal circumstances. It is important to consider the user's age and smoking status when determining OC attributable risks.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2515940> and coagulation of two contraceptives: correlation to serum concentrations of  and gestodene.</a></h2><p>The effects of two triphasic oral contraceptives containing the same amount of ethinylestradiol (EE) in combination with  (LNG) or gestodene (GES), respectively, on  and coagulation were studied. Serum concentrations of GES and LNG were determined at the same time. Thirty-three healthy women were randomized into two groups receiving either of the preparations. Before treatment and in the 3rd and the 6th cycle, blood samples were drawn in the morning while subjects were still in bed to obtain basal conditions. HDL2-cholesterol decreased in the LNG group but was unchanged in the GES group, whereas apolipoprotein A1 increased in the GES but not in the LNG group. Antithrombin III decreased in the GES group but was unchanged in the LNG-treated women. Factor VII increased in both groups, but more in the GES group. It is concluded that GES has a positive influence on , and has a slightly negative influence on coagulation but the latter is more likely to be without clinical relevance. The positive influence of GES compared to LNG on lipids is probably due to its lower androgenicity and not to differences in bioavailability.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2906345>Clinical and metabolic effects of gestodene and .</a></h2><p>The new low-dose combination oral contraceptive (OC) containing 75 micrograms of the new progestogen gestodene (GTD) plus 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol (EE) was clinically tested and compared with a  (LNG) combined pill (150 micrograms LNG plus 30 micrograms EE).

The combination of anastrozole (ATZ) and  (LNG) in an IVR with an intended 4-week wearing period has been considered for long-term treatment of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain. A randomized, parallel-group, multicenter phase 2b study to assess the efficacy and safety of different dose combinations in women with symptomatic endometriosis has recently been performed. This paper will focus on the investigation of pharmacokinetic (PK) effects of ATZ on LNG using data collected from this study. Two hundred sixteen patients were randomized to the treatment group with IVRs releasing LNG 40 μg/day alone or in combination with ATZ 300 μg/day, 600 μg/day, or 1050 μg/day for 12 weeks. PK blood samples were taken before dosing and before IVR replacement or removal (days 28, 56, and 84). The primary PK parameter was the plasma concentration in apparent steady state of ATZ and LNG at the end of each IVR wearing period. Results of PK analysis demonstrate that ATZ concentrations increased proportionally with increasing dose (geometric mean values of 7.85, 15.48, and 22.61 μg/L at 300, 600, and 1050 μg/day nominal release, respectively). All point estimates for LNG concentration in apparent steady state ratios between the mono and combination IVR groups were close to 1, and the 90% confidence interval limits were in the 0.80 to 1.25 range (1.01 [0.85-1.19], 1.03 [0.88-1.20], 0.94 [0.80-1.10]).

This study aims to assess this relationship in the reproductive life women in the menacme who use combined oral contraceptives (COCs).  A total of 49 healthy women who were sexually active received COC pills that contained ethinylestradiol 30 mcg (EE30) plus  150 mcg (LNG150). The women were divided into two groups according to their lipid profiles. Dyslipidemia was defined as a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level < 50 mg/dL or a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level > 130 mg/dL. Sexual function was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) Questionnaire. Lipid and lipoprotein parameters were obtained at baseline and after the sixth cycle.  After six cycles of the COCs, the total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels in the women with a LDL level > 130 mg/dL decreased by 14.7% and 22.1% respectively. In the women with a HDL level < 50 mg/dL at baseline, the HDL level increased by 15.5% at the end of the study. The arousal and orgasm domains and the FSFI total scores significantly increased in women with and without dyslipidemia. The desire and satisfaction domains increased only in the group without dyslipidemia at the end of the treatment period.  The EE30/LNG150 formulation increased the sexual function and it was only positively correlated with the HDL cholesterol level.

Effects on .</a></h2><p>The risk-benefit profile of any pharmacologic agent must be evaluated against risks connected with the events to be avoided. This is especially true in the case of hormonal contraception, not intended to combat a disease. Over the six decades during which their use has progressively expanded, the risk-benefit profile of combined oral contraceptives (COC) has substantially changed, with new combinations, dosages and mode of administration appearing on the market. Area covered: In a series of articles, recent information on the complex issue of COC risks and benefits will be reviewed in the hope of providing an updated picture. The present article reviews  changes occurring during use of modern combinations of estrogens (ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, estradiol valerate and estetrol) and new progestins (desogestrel, gestodene, dienogest, drospirenone, nomegestrol acetate), often compared to classic compounds, such as . Three categories of  effects in healthy women are detailed: on carbohydrates, lipid and bone mineral content. Expert commentary: Overall, the picture is reassuring: the new generations of progestins are basically devoid of androgenic, estrogenic or glucocorticoid related side-effects. This should result in an improved safety profile, although past history teaches us that that large comparative and surveillance studies are required before firm conclusions can be drawn. At any rate, available evidence indicates that  effects of third and fourth generation progestins, especially when they are combined with natural estrogens, are minimal and, if used in healthy women, should not cause concern.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17054193>Hormonal versus non-hormonal contraceptives in women with diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2.</a></h2><p>Adequate contraceptive advice is important in women with diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2 to reduce the risk of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality in unplanned pregnancies. A wide variety of contraceptives are available for these women. However hormonal contraceptives might influence carbohydrate and  and increase micro- and macrovascular complications. So caution in selecting a contraceptive method is required.To investigate whether progestogen-only, combined estrogen/progestogen or non-hormonal contraceptives differ in terms of effectiveness in preventing pregnancy, in their side effects on carbohydrate and  and in long-term complications such as micro- and macrovascular disease, when used in women with diabetes mellitus.The search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL/CCTR, POPLINE, CINAHL, WorldCat, ECO, ArticleFirst, the Science Citation Index, the British Library Inside, and reference lists of relevant articles. Last search was performed in May 2005. In addition, experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies marketing contraceptives were contacted to identify published, unpublished or ongoing studies.Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that studied women with diabetes mellitus comparing: 1. hormonal versus non-hormonal contraceptives. 2. progestogen-only versus estrogen/progestogen contraceptives. 3. contraceptives containing <50 microg estrogen versus contraceptives containing > or = 50 microg estrogen. 4. contraceptives containing 'first'-, 'second'- and 'third'-generation progestogens, drospirenone and cyproterone acetate. Principal outcomes were contraceptive effectiveness, diabetes control,  and micro- and macrovascular complications.Two investigators evaluated the titles and abstracts from the literature search. Quality assessment was performed independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion or consulting a third reviewer. Because the trials differed in studied contraceptives, participant characteristics and methodological quality, we could not combine the data in a meta-analysis. The trials were therefore examined on an individual basis and narrative summaries were provided.Three randomised controlled trials were included. Only one was of good methodological quality. It compared the influence of -releasing IUD versus copper-IUD on carbohydrate  in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus. No difference was found in daily insulin requirement, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or fasting blood sugar after twelve months. The other two trials were of limited methodological quality. Both compared progestogen-only pills with different estrogen/progestogen combinations. The trials reported blood glucose levels to remain stable during treatment with most regimens. Only high-dose combined oral contraceptives were found to slightly impair glucose homeostasis. Combined oral contraceptives also appeared to have a minor adverse effect on  whereas progestogen-only contraceptives slightly improved . Only one study reported on micro- and macrovascular complications. No signs or symptoms of thromboembolic incidents or visual disturbances were observed. However study duration was short. Minor adverse effects were reported in one study. The trial found progestogen-only pills to cause more bleeding irregularities when compared with combined oral contraceptives. Unintended pregnancies were not observed during any of the studies.The three included randomised controlled trials in this systematic review provided insufficient evidence to assess whether progestogen-only and combined contraceptives differ from non-hormonal contraceptives in diabetes control,  and complications. Two of the three studies were of limited methodological quality, sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and described surrogate outcomes. Ideally, an adequately reported, high-quality randomised controlled trial analysing both intermediate outcomes (i.e. glucose and ) and true clinical endpoints (micro- and macrovascular disease) in users of combined, progestogen-only and non-hormonal contraceptives should be conducted. However, due to the low incidence of micro- and macrovascular disease and accordingly the large sample size and follow-up period needed to observe differences in risk, a randomised controlled trial might not be the ideal design.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25422650>-releasing intrauterine system (Mirena) in compare to medroxyprogesterone acetate as a therapy for endometrial hyperplasia.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to evaluate the comparison of insertion of  (LNG)-releasing intrauterine system versus oral medroxyprogesterone acetate on endometrial hyperplasia in a randomized controlled trial.A total of 60 women with the initial histopathological diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia in two groups received LNG or medroxyprogesterone (10 mg/d orally) for 12 days a month for 3 months).

We determined the frequency of misreported hormonal contraceptive use among African women with and at risk for HIV.We tested 1102 archived serum samples from 664 African women who had participated in prospective HIV prevention studies. Using a novel high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay, we quantified exogenous hormones for injectables (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone), oral contraceptives (OC) ( or ethinyl estradiol) and implants ( or etonogestrel) and compared them to self-reported use.Among women reporting hormonal contraceptive use, 258/358 (72%) of samples were fully concordant with self-report, as were 642/744 (86%) of samples from women reporting no hormonal contraceptive use. However, 42/253 (17%) of samples from women reporting injectable use, 41/66 (62%) of samples from self-reported OC users and 3/39 (8%) of samples from self-reported implant users had no quantifiable hormones. Among self-reported nonusers, 102/744 (14%) had ≥1 hormone present. Concordance between self-reported method and exogenous hormones did not differ by HIV status.Among African women with and at risk for HIV, testing of exogenous hormones revealed agreement with self-reported contraceptive use for most women. However, unexpected exogenous hormones were identified among self-reported hormonal contraceptive users and nonusers, and an important fraction of women reporting hormonal contraceptive use had no hormones detected; absence of oral contraceptive hormones could be due, at least in part, to samples taken during the hormone-free interval. Misreporting of hormonal contraceptive use could lead to biased results in observational studies of the relationship between contraceptive use and health outcomes.Research studies investigating associations between hormonal contraceptive use and HIV should consider validating self-reported use by objective measures; because both overreporting and underreporting of use occur, potential misclassification based on self-report could lead to biased results in directions that cannot be easily predicted.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Ethinyl estradiol and  have been mainstay contraceptive hormones for the last four decades. Surprisingly, there is scant information regarding their action on the central nervous system and behavior. Intact female rats received three weeks of subcutaneous ethinyl estradiol (10 or 30μg/rat/day),  (20 or 60μg/rat/day), a combination of both (10/20μg/rat/day and 30/60μg/rat/day), or vehicle. Subsequently, the rats were tested in three versions of the novel object recognition test to assess learning and memory, and a battery of tests for anxiety-like behavior. Serum estradiol and ovarian weights were measured. All treatment groups exhibited low endogenous 17β-estradiol levels at the time of testing. Dose-dependent effects of drug treatment manifested in both cognitive and anxiety tests. All low dose drugs decreased anxiety-like behavior and impaired performance on novel object recognition. In contrast, the high dose ethinyl estradiol increased anxiety-like behavior and improved performance in cognitive testing. In the cell molecular analyses, low doses of all drugs induced a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA and protein in the locus coeruleus. At the same time, low doses of ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol/ increased galanin protein in this structure. Consistent with the findings above, the low dose treatments of ethinyl estradiol and combination ethinyl estradiol/ reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in the hippocampus. These effects of ethinyl estradiol 10μg alone and in combination with  20μg suggest a diminution of norepinephrine input into the hippocampus resulting in a decline in learning and memory.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Bibliographies of retrieved articles were reviewed to identify additional references.All identified studies published in English and involving efficacy and safety of estradiol valerate/dienogest as an oral contraceptive were reviewed.Estradiol valerate/dienogest is a 4-phasic oral contraceptive approved for the prevention of pregnancy. The 4-phasic design allows for acceptable cycle control with this hormonal combination. In efficacy trials of estradiol valerate/dienogest in women aged 18-35 years, the Pearl Index ranged from 0.40 to 1.64, a range comparable to that of other combination oral contraceptives. The safety profile was also similar to that of other oral contraceptives, with headache, metrorrhagia, breast tenderness, nausea or vomiting, acne, and  gain reported as the most common adverse effects. Menstrual bleeding patterns and cycle control with estradiol valerate/dienogest were comparable to those of a monophasic oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol/. Estradiol valerate/dienogest differs from other oral contraceptives in that it necessitates more stringent dosing guidelines for maximum contraceptive efficacy. New starts should be on the first day of menses only, and a back-up method of contraception is required for the first 9 days, as compared to 7 days with other oral contraceptives. Back-up contraception is usually required for any pill taken more than 12 hours later than scheduled.Estradiol valerate/dienogest is an effective oral contraceptive.

Geometric mean ratios (90 % CI) of AUC(τ,ss) and C (max,ss) for EE were 102.82 % (97.58, 108.35) and 99.22 % (93.40, 105.39), respectively. For LNG, these values were 101.94 % (98.54, 105.47) and 105.81 % (99.47, 112.55), respectively. The 90 % CIs were within the standard bioequivalence boundaries of 80-125 %. There were no relevant changes in the time to reach peak levels (t (max,ss)) or terminal elimination half-life (t (½,ss)) of EE and LNG between test and reference treatments. Ten women in each treatment had at least one adverse event (AE). Severe AEs were reported by three women in the reference period and one woman in the test period. There were no serious AEs or premature discontinuations.The combination of EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg and empagliflozin 25 mg was well tolerated. Based on standard bioequivalence criteria, empagliflozin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG, indicating that no dose adjustment of EE 30 μg/LNG 150 μg is required when empagliflozin is co-administered.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29175414>The Effect of Drug Content Reduction on the In Vitro and In Vivo Properties of -Releasing Intravaginal Rings.</a></h2><p>Intravaginal rings (IVRs) are an option for continuous administration of drugs in women. However, a considerable amount of excess drug often remains in the ring upon removal. The current study focuses on comparing 2 IVRs releasing  (LNG). Both formulations were designed to release 40 μg of LNG daily, however, with a significant difference in the total amount of drug (10.6 vs. 176.9 mg). Numerical simulations and in vitro release rate testing were utilized in designing the IVRs and confirming the similarity of drug release. Moreover, a pharmacokinetic (PK) study was performed in 13 healthy Japanese women to investigate both formulations during the intended wearing period of 28 days. The primary PK metrics was the average concentration of LNG in plasma at defined time points under stable conditions. Statistical evaluation of the ratio of the main PK metrics indicated values almost in the bioequivalence range. Furthermore, drug content determinations for used and unused IVRs were analyzed for confirming the expected drug delivery in vivo. In summary, it was shown that with proper design, even major differences in the total drug content of IVR formulations might not result in significant effects in the in vitro and in vivo release properties.Copyright © 2018 American Pharmacists Association®.

We investigated the influence of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the body mass index (BMI) and serum leptin levels in 20 postmenopausal, nonobese women treated with transdermal HRT (delivery rate 50 microg 17beta-estradiol/24 h, 1 patch per week) for 6 months. Serum leptin levels were measured by ELISA and results were compared by means of the Student's paired t-test or Pearson's correlation. The mean patient age was 55+/-6.04 years. The mean body weight prior to the start of the study was 69.39+/-9.37 kg, and the BMI before HRT was 26.92+/-4.47 kg/m2. Both parameters remained unchanged under therapy. No significant change in absolute serum leptin values (18.8+/-8.4 ng/ml; 20.47+/-9.7 ng/ml; 17.92+/-8.7 ng/ml at 0, 4 and 6 months respectively) or in adiposity-corrected values (serum leptin/BMI) (0.68+/-0.24; 0.75+/-0.29; 0.67+/-0.26 at 0, 4 and 6 months respectively) were found. Serum leptin levels correlated well with BMI (r = 0.7193, p<0.0001). There was no significant correlation of estradiol with serum leptin levels before or during therapy.

It enters the environment as a component of wastewater treatment plant effluent, and has been measured at low ng/L concentrations in surface waters. It has been shown to activate fish androgen receptors, causing the physical masculinization of females, changes in reproductive behavior, and decreases in fecundity. In the present study, the effects of  exposure on early-stage oogenesis in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) was examined. Adult females were exposed to 0, 10, or 100 ng/L  for 14 d using a flow-through exposure system. The ovaries from each female were then removed via dissection and weighed for gonadosomatic index (GSI) calculations, and oocytes from one lobe preserved in Serra's fixative. Total numbers of late-stage vitellogenic oocytes exhibiting a germinal vesicle were then quantified. In a second exposure, blood plasma samples were collected from adult females and analyzed for vitellogenin concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Females exposed to both concentrations of  developed male secondary sexual characteristics in a dose-dependent manner, and ovaries contained significantly fewer late stage oocytes. Exposure to 100 ng/L of  resulted in decreased GSI and blood plasma vitellogenin concentrations. The results suggest that female exposure to  alone may have profound effects on reproduction in progestin-contaminated environments.

Individually, the estrogen 17β-estradiol (E2) and Levo can improve cognition in preclinical models. However, although these hormones are often given together clinically, the impact of the E2 + Levo combination on cognitive function has yet to be methodically examined. Thus, we investigated E2 + Levo treatment on a cognitive battery in middle-aged, ovariectomized rats. When administered alone, E2 and Levo treatments each enhanced spatial working memory relative to vehicle treatment, whereas the E2 + Levo combination impaired high working memory load performance relative to E2 only and Levo only treatments. There were no effects on spatial reference memory. Mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathway activation, which is involved in memory formation and estrogen-induced memory effects, was evaluated in 5 brain regions implicated in learning and memory. A distinct relationship was seen in the E2-only treatment group between mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathway activation in the frontal cortex and working memory performance. Collectively, the results indicate that the differential neurocognitive effects of combination versus sole treatments are vital considerations as we move forward as a field to develop novel, and to understand currently used, exogenous hormone regimens across the lifespan.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

For that, a mesocosm experiment was implemented where adult zebrafish were exposed to combined temperature and the progestin  (LNG) for 21 days. Considering that the liver is one of the organs where there is a greater metabolization and accumulation of toxicants, the main objective of this work was to assess the effects of both stressors on the female zebrafish hepatocytes morphology and functioning, through stereological and immunohistochemical techniques. Our results revealed an increase of coefficient of variation of the number distribution of hepatocytes volume (CV(υ)) for individuals exposed to LNG, which denotes an increase of the hepatocytes size variability and is suggestive of functional impacts. This was corroborated by the signs of increased glycogen content with the exposure to increased LNG concentrations and temperature, indicating modified hepatocyte glycogen metabolism. Such disturbances can be considered indicators that the fish had to deal with impacts caused by the stress factors. Regarding the immunoreactivity, from the four proteins selected (catalase, CYP1A, HSP90 and Vtg), just in two of them (catalase and Vtg) were observed some responses to both stressors. For catalase there was a hormetic response, in which exposure to lower LNG concentrations caused a significant higher positive immunostaining than under higher LNG concentrations. While, for Vtg, significant effects of temperature and LNG existed, in which a decline in Vtg immunostaining was observed with exposure to higher temperature and lower LNG concentrations. These results should be seen as a warning sign about fine impacts of multiple stressors, such as temperature and progestogens, on the structure and functioning of zebrafish liver and potentially in other aquatic organisms, and on their health implications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the work of Nikkila, it shows the source of the production of HDL and LDL, the factors that can affect these lipoprotein levels, and where in the cascade of lipoprotein  these factors exert influence. The source of HDL production is the liver and the intestine. At this stage, diet, exercise, hormones, genetics, drugs, and certain disease states can affect HDL levels. Lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) esterifies HDL-free cholesterol in plasma, and HDL3 is formed that in turn is transformed to HDL2. At the same time, VLDL from the gut and the liver will be converted, under the influence of LPL, to HDL2 and LDL. Thus HDL2 is being formed by the breakdown of VLDL and from the transformation of HDL3 to HDL2. Insulin, exercise, alcohol, fats, drugs, and diet affect lipoprotein lipase and consequently influence levels of LDL and HDL2 indirectly. Progestogens increase and estrogens decrease hepatic endothelial lipase, thus affecting the HDL2 concentration. It is at this point that combination OCs influence HDL2. The balance between estrogen and progestogen in a given contraceptive determines the extent and direction of HDL2 concentration. A separate pathway in the liver also catabolizes HDL2 and HDL3. LDL is generated partly from catabolism of VLDL and is partly secreted from the liver. The removal of LDL is mediated by receptors in both the liver and peripheral tissues. It is here that the Brown-Goldstein theory plays a major role. If LDL receptors are present in an insufficient number or are defective, then the C will accumulate and atherosclerosis may follow. Thus two key enzymes, LCAT and LPL, control the production of HDL2 and LDL, whereas a third enzyme, hepatic endothelial lipase, catabolizes HDL2.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3102539>Oral contraception and insulin sensitivity: in vivo assessment in normal women and women with previous gestational .</a></h2><p>The sensitivity to insulin (euglycemic clamp technique) was assessed in previous gestational diabetic women (n = 6) and nondiabetic women (n = 6) before and twice during low-dose triphasic oral contraceptive administration (ethinyl estradiol and ) for 6 months.

The current challenge is to minimize the side effects and metabolic impact of the administered hormones in both oral contraceptives and hormone replacement agents. When the dose of estrogen in oral contraceptives was reduced the risk of thromboembolism decreased, but the androgenic side effects of the progestin became increasingly apparent. The addition of progestins to hormone replacement therapy reduces the risk of endometrial cancer associated with unopposed estrogen, but their androgenicity offsets the favorable effects of estrogen on . Androgens not only cause troublesome clinical side effects but also induce changes in blood levels of lipoproteins that have been associated with an increased risk of atherogenesis and coronary heart disease, as well as alterations in glucose and insulin levels.

Absorption of sacubitril/valsartan and conversion of sacubitril (prodrug) to sacubitrilat (neprilysin inhibitor) was rapid with maximum plasma concentrations of sacubitril, sacubitrilat, and valsartan (angiotensin receptor blocker) reaching within 0.5, 1.5-2.0, and 2.0-3.0 h, respectively. With a two-fold increase in dose, an increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve was proportional for sacubitril, ~1.9-fold for sacubitrilat, and ~1.7-fold for valsartan in healthy subjects. Following multiple twice-daily administration, steady-state maximum plasma concentration was reached within 3 days, showing no accumulation for sacubitril and valsartan, while ~1.6-fold accumulation for sacubitrilat. Sacubitril is eliminated predominantly as sacubitrilat through the kidney; valsartan is eliminated mainly by biliary route. Drug-drug interactions of sacubitril/valsartan were evaluated with medications commonly used in patients with heart failure including furosemide, warfarin, digoxin, carvedilol, /ethinyl estradiol combination, amlodipine, omeprazole, hydrochlorothiazide, intravenous nitrates, metformin, statins, and sildenafil. Co-administration with sacubitril/valsartan increased the maximum plasma concentration (~2.0-fold) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (1.3-fold) of atorvastatin; however, it did not affect the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin. Age, sex, or ethnicity did not affect the pharmacokinetics of sacubitril/valsartan. In patients with heart failure vs. healthy subjects, area under the plasma concentration-time curves of sacubitril, sacubitrilat, and valsartan were higher by approximately 1.6-, 2.1-, and 2.3-fold, respectively. Renal impairment had no significant impact on sacubitril and valsartan area under the plasma concentration-time curves, while the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of sacubitrilat correlated with degree of renal function (1.3-, 2.3-, 2.9-, and 3.3-fold with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, and end-stage renal disease, respectively).

Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and  effects of a POC, the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), in women with PCOS followed up over a period of 6 months compared to baseline and to women without PCOS. Thus, an observational, prospective, controlled study was conducted on 30 women with a diagnosis of PCOS who presented adverse effect secondary to the use of combined oral contraceptives (nausea, headache, mastalgia or vomiting; PCOS group) paired with 30 ovulatory women without PCOS (control group), both groups being free of comorbidities and having chosen the LNG-IUS as contraceptive. Clinical, laboratory, and ultrasonographic variables were evaluated immediately before LNG-IUS insertion and 6 months after the use of this method. Before LNG-IUS insertion, the PCOS group had higher total testosterone levels (P = .04), lower HDL levels (P = .04), and greater ovarian volume (P < .01) than the control group. Six months after LNG-IUS insertion, there was a 2.3% increase in abdominal circumference (P = .04) and a 3.4% increase in fasting glycemia (P = .02). On the other hand, mean ovarian volume was 10% smaller compared to the volume found before LNG-IUS insertion (P = .04), LDL levels were reduced by 5.2% (P = .03), and total cholesterol levels were reduced by 6.7% (P < .01) compared to baseline evaluation in the PCOS group. The remaining variables did not differ significantly during the 6 months of observation. The control group did not show significant changes compared to the period before LNG-IUS insertion. When the groups were compared after the 6-month follow-up, only glycemia showed a statistically significant variation between the groups, with glycemia levels increasing by 3.4% in the PCOS group and decreasing by 2.6% in the control group (P = .008). In conclusion, the use of the LNG-IUS for 6 months was not associated with relevant changes in clinical or  variables of women with no comorbidities regardless of the presence of PCOS.© The Author(s) 2016.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolic syndrome', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3781292>[Oral contraceptives and metabolic changes].</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393993>Efavirenz- but not nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy decreases exposure to the  released from a sub-dermal contraceptive implant.</a></h2><p>Sub-dermal hormone implants, such as  (LNG), are a safe and desirable form of long-acting contraception, but their use among HIV-positive women on antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be compromised given the potential for a cytochrome P450 3A-mediated drug-drug interaction. Our study aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of LNG released from a sub-dermal implant over six months in HIV-positive Ugandan women on nevirapine (NVP)- or efavirenz (EFV)-based ART.This non-randomized, parallel group study compared LNG pharmacokinetics between HIV-positive Ugandan women not yet eligible for ART (control group, n=18) and those on stable NVP- (n=20) or EFV- (n=20) based ART.

Freshly isolated LDL was incubated in the presence of Cu(++) in the absence or presence of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells in phenol red-free medium and without or with hormones in 0.5% ethanol. The hormones included 17beta-estradiol (E(2)), progesterone (Pg), norgestimate (NGM),  (LNG), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). LDL oxidation was measured as formation of conjugated dienes,  peroxides, and TBARS, and cyotoxicity by tetrazolium salt reduction (MTT reduction). Progestins diminished conjugated diene lag phase, accelerated  peroxide and TBARS production in the absence and presence of cells and accelerated cytotoxicity. When E(2) and progestin were incubated with cells at a molar ratio of 1:5,  peroxides were reduced from baseline by E(2) alone 31%, E(2)/Pg 29%, E(2)/NGM 16%, E(2)/LNG 9% (all P<0.05 or more) and E(2)/MPA 8% (ns) (E(2) or E(2)E(2)/NGM, E(2)/LNG and E(2)/MPA [P<0.001]; E(2)E(2)/LNG or E(2)/MPA [P<0.05]).

A population PK analysis and simulations were performed for ATZ and LNG based on clinical phase 1 study data from 66 healthy women. A PK/PD model was developed to predict the probability of a maximum follicle size ≥30 mm and the potential contribution of ATZ beside the known LNG effects. Population PK models for ATZ and LNG were established where the interaction of LNG with sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) as well as a stimulating effect of estradiol on SHBG were considered. Furthermore, simulations showed that doses of 40 μg/d LNG combined with 300, 600, or 1050 μg/d ATZ reached anticipated exposure levels for both drugs, facilitating selection of ATZ and LNG doses in the phase 2 dose-finding study. The main driver for the effect on maximum follicle size appears to be unbound LNG exposure. A 50% probability of maximum follicle size ≥30 mm was estimated for 40 μg/d LNG based on the exposure-response analysis.

To evaluate predictors of OC noncompliance during this study, we compared the characteristics of compliant and noncompliant participants using multivariable logistic regression. We assigned each participant to a relative poverty level based on US census data; all other individual characteristics came directly from participant responses during the baseline interview.One hundred eighty-one women completed the study; 31 were noncompliant (17%). In multivariable analyses, poverty level was the strongest predictor of noncompliance. Compared with those women in the quartile with the lowest level of residential poverty, other women were far more likely to be noncompliant, especially women in the quartile with the greatest prevalence of poverty (adjusted odds ratio, 8.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-46.1). Additional factors associated with noncompliance were education level less than a bachelor's degree and Hispanic ethnicity. Other demographic and psychometric  were not associated with compliance.We found that noncompliance was strongly associated with residential poverty level, an indirect measure of individual income. In the United States, poverty is associated with female obesity, Hispanic ethnicity and low education, which were also associated here with noncompliance.

In contrast, concurrent progestin therapy may oppose this beneficial effect. We studied the effect of long-term estrogen HRT and combined HRT on vasomotor function and on plasma nitrate, which reflects the amount of NO in the circulation. As  peroxidation affects NO production and impairs endothelial function, we also measured the amount of the in vivo  peroxidation marker urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2 alpha). The study group comprised 15 women receiving estradiol valerate HRT (mean age, 56 yr; treatment duration, 10.5 yr) and 15 women receiving combined HRT with estradiol valerate and  (mean age, 58 yr; treatment duration, 11.3 yr). The peak flow velocity (PFV) and pulsatility index of the common carotid and internal carotid artery and the abdominal aorta were measured by ultrasonography after long-term HRT (baseline), after a 4-wk pause and again 3 wk after reintroducing HRT. A statistically significant interaction between the groups and time points was observed in the PFV of the internal carotid artery (P = 0.011). In women taking estradiol valerate, the PFV values decreased significantly after withdrawal of HRT (P = 0.007) and increased again to the baseline level after reintroduction of therapy (P < 0.001). In women receiving combined HRT, the PFV remained stable over all study periods. At baseline, the PFV of women taking estradiol valerate correlated with the plasma nitrate concentration in the common carotid artery (r = 0.646; P = 0.009) and in the abdominal aorta (r = 0.579; P = 0.024).

The ultrasound-induced destruction of estrogen compounds in aqueous solutions is studied in a batch reactor using a 1.1 W/mL sonication unit and in a continuous flow reactor using a 2.1 W/mL sonication unit. The estrogen compounds of interest are 17alpha-estradiol, 17beta-estradiol, ethinyl estradiol, estrone, equilin, gestodene, , and norgestrel. Effects of process variables such as temperature, pH, and pressure are examined. The degradation of estrogens follows pseudo first-order kinetics. The reaction likely takes place in the interfacial region where supercritical environment is produced upon cavity implosion and in the bulk solution with radical species. Low solution pH is more favorable for destruction of estrogens. A kinetic degradation model is developed to predict the destruction of estrogen compounds. Low solution temperature shows favorable destruction of estrogens. Increasing the fluid pressure is detrimental to reaction efficiency.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2449395>Oral contraceptive absorption and sex hormone binding globulins in obese women: effects of jejunoileal bypass.</a></h2><p>Plasma levels of two oral contraceptive gestagens were studied during 24 hour oral challenges in seven morbidly obese women after jejunoileal bypass comparing the results to unoperated normal controls. To study binding and transport of the gestagens, sex hormone binding globulin levels were determined in these patients, in normal-weight controls, and in unoperated morbidly obese patients. The unoperated morbidly obese patients had significantly decreased levels of sex hormone binding globulin, compared to normal-weight controls and to the jejunoileal bypass patients, whose levels were similar to the controls. The jejunoileal bypass patients had a reduced capacity to absorb oral contraceptive gestagens, although the plasma levels were of the same magnitude found in normal subjects using lower doses of gestagens. However, the gestagen to sex hormone binding globulin ratio was lower in jejunoileal bypass patients, implying reduced biologic activity and thus reduced contraceptive efficiency of the gestagen. There were no enzymatic or morphologic signs of liver dysfunction. No correlations were found between plasma gestagen levels and number or volume of stools, fecal fat excretion, or intravenous C-cholic acid load. It is concluded that caution must be exercised in prescribing oral contraceptives to jejunoileal bypass patients.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8576880>Subdermal  implants.

The net three-year cumulative pregnancy rate was 0.98%. Menstrual disturbances, ranging from amenorrhea to menorrhagia, were the major side effects and were present in 25% of women during the third year. These disturbances resulted in 28 removals, 19 of which were because of amenorrhea. Medical complications, including headache, hypertension and non-insulin dependent ; desire for pregnancy; and complications at the insertion site (such as infection, spontaneous expulsion of the capsules and arm pain) were the principal reasons for another 57 implant removals. So far, no gynecologic or breast lesions have developed, and weight changes were not noted. The continuation rate after three years was 65.5%.The efficacy, safety and acceptability of the implant suggest that it will provide an important addition to the contraceptive armamentarium.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20213838>In vivo absorption of steroidal hormones from smart polymer based delivery systems.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to develop smart polymer based controlled delivery systems to deliver steroidal hormones after single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection at predetermined rates over extended period of time. In vivo absorption and pharmacokinetics of  (LNG) and testosterone (TSN) were investigated from the thermosensitive and phase sensitive polymeric controlled delivery systems. A selective, reliable, and rapid method for determination of serum LNG concentration was developed using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandom mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface (HPLC-MS-MS with APCI), while TSN in serum samples was detected and quantified by a competitive immunoassay. The delivery systems controlled the absorption of LNG in rabbits up to 6 weeks from thermosensitive and approximately 4 weeks from phase sensitive polymeric delivery systems. In vivo study of TSN delivery systems in castrated rabbits controlled the release of TSN for at least 2 months from both thermosensitive and phase sensitive polymers.

It is composed of a hollow cylindrical drug reservoir (containing  and polydimethylsiloxane), which is covered with a release rate controlling silicone membrane. This structure presents a manufacturing challenge and to date, there have been no literature reports on the manufacturing, product design and quality evaluation of these hollow cylindrical intrauterine devices. It is vital to develop a reproducible and robust manufacturing process for these long-acting intrauterine devices or systems to obtain an understanding the in vitro and in vivo performance of such drug-device combinations. In this study, a twin-syringe method with a customized mold was developed to manufacture hollow cylindrical polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based  intrauterine systems (LNG-IUSs). Different mold materials, curing temperatures and times were screened to fabricate PDMS-drug reservoirs with good quality characteristics (easy demolding, good appearance and appropriate physicochemical characteristics). The prepared PDMS-drug reservoirs were covered with the release rate controlling membrane to fabricate the LNG-IUSs. Physicochemical characterization (drug content and content uniformity, powder X-Ray diffraction (PXRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the PDMS-drug reservoirs with different drug loadings (10%, 25% and 50% w/w) was conducted. Real-time in vitro drug release testing of LNG-IUSs with different drug loading was performed in normal saline (0.9% w/v NaCl) at 37 °C using a water bath shaker rotating at 100 rpm. The prepared PDMS-drug reservoirs demonstrated good and reproducible quality characteristics including appearance (smooth surfaces), targeted drug loading and good drug content uniformity in the PDMS matrix. The PXRD showed that the crystallinity of the API was maintained inside the PDMS matrix. DSC, TGA and FTIR confirmed the structure of the drug and the PDMS, indicating no interaction between the drug and the PDMS matrix in the prepared LNG-IUSs. Real-time in vitro drug release from the LNG-IUSs with different drug loadings showed zero-order release kinetics, and the drug release rate (based on daily release percentage) was inversely proportional to the drug loading.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Today most oral contraceptives contain less tha 50 microgram of estrogen. Furthermore, prescribing practices have improved so that most women with risk factors are not taking oral contraceptives. No differences in risk of fatal myocardial infarctions could be demonstrated by women taking 50 microgram estrogen products versus those taking products with lower estrogen dosages.

Two main methods are currently available: oral pills or the copper-T intrauterine device. In recent years there has been some debate regarding the efficacy of oral therapy in obese women. In this brief commentary we review new evidence, published after the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) referral of 2014, relating to the effect of obesity on the pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of  EC in light of some of the concerns that have been raised.  A PubMed literature search ("" and "emergency contraception") was conducted between 1 January 2005 to 31 March 2018; results from the main clinical trials are discussed. Additional literature known to the authors and identified from the reference lists of cited publications was included.  Overall, it should be noted that, in studies which determined pregnancy rates across different  or BMI categories, the overall pregnancy rate was low (1-2%) and there was no direct evidence that lower  plasma levels contributed to an increased pregnancy rate in obese women. This conclusion was reached by the EMA referral in 2014 and they concluded that emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) could be taken regardless of  or BMI, as soon as possible after UPSI. Since the EMA review, additional evidence has been published regarding this topic. This includes PK data (which can neither support, nor deny the previously submitted meta-analyses during the Article 31 Referral procedure), or re-analyses of the previously submitted data.  Evidence published since the EMA referral in 2014 does not change the original conclusions of the agency, which recommended that ECPs could be taken regardless of  or BMI, as soon as possible after UPSI.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18569277>Menorrhagia and severe menstrual pain related to the use of adalimumab in a psoriatic.</a></h2><p>The case is reported of a 32-year-old morbidly obese white woman who used adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 4 months for psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis vulgaris and inverse psoriasis with total clearance of her psoriasis who developed menorrhagia (at least twice the number of pads used daily for 4-6 days as opposed to 3-5 days previously) and severe menstrual pain.

In young eugonadal men, similar dosages of T increase lean mass, but much higher dosages of T are required to decrease total body  mass. Current T-based male hormonal contraceptive regimens include a second agent, such as a progestin, to maximize inhibition of pituitary gonadotropins and improve efficacy.

There was no change in weight or body mass index in any group during the study. This study shows that in young eugonadal men 1) T alone rapidly increases lean mass and decreases  mass in 4-8 wk; 2) T+LNG rapidly increases lean mass, but has no effect on  mass; and 3) LNG alone increases  mass.

Total response and cyclical variations were calculated.All active treatment regimens reduced serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) significantly: E/CPA, 6% (95% confidence limits 0.3% to 11.3%); E/LNG, 10.9% (4.9% to 16.6%); E/MPA, 14.4% (7.4% to 20.9%); E/DG, 10.7% (3.3% to 17.6%). The changes in serum total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were similar but smaller than those in LDL-C. None of these treatment regimens induced significant overall changes in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1). The sequentially combined hormone treatments induced significant cyclical variations in HDL-C, with an increase during estrogen therapy and a decrease during combined therapy: E/LNG, 13.3% (7.4% to 19.4%); E/MPA, 6.9% (1.6% to 12.6%); E/DG, 10.3% (5.8% to 14.9%). No cyclical changes in HDL-C were found in the group receiving continuously combined hormone replacement therapy (E/CPA).

While LNG has established effects on the stromal and glandular compartments of the endometrial tissue, its effect on the endometrial endothelial cells has not been investigated. We examined whether LNG regulates fibrinolytic factors, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) secreted by human endometrial endothelial cells (HEECs) and determined the steroid receptor through which LNG exerts its effect on the endothelium.The HEECs were treated with LNG or progesterone and levels of tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) measured. The HEECs were specifically examined for the presence of androgen receptors through Western blot.  ± flutamide were added to HEECs and the levels of tPA and uPA were examined.An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay performed on culture media confirmed a statistically significant decrease in tPA levels in cells treated with LNG (77.80% ± 8.0% of control; n = 5, P < .05 vs control) but not progesterone. The androgen receptor (110 kDa) was detected in HEEC lysates. The decrease in tPA was blocked by the addition of flutamide (101.3% ± 16% of control), a classic nonsteroidal androgen receptor blocker. There was no change in uPA or PAI-1 levels in cells treated with LNG. decreases tPA levels through the androgen receptor in HEECs. Thus, LNG inhibits tPA secretion by the endometrial endothelial cell. This response suggests reduction in HMB with LNG-IUS could reflect an LNG-mediated promotion of hemostasis.© The Author(s) 2016.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25740268>Effect of pradigastat, a diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of a combination oral contraceptive in healthy female subjects.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between pradigastat, a potent and selective diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor, and Levora-28®, a combination oral contraceptive (COC) containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol (EE) and 150 μg  (LVG).An open-label, single-sequence three-period (period 1, single dose of COC; period 2, pradigastat 100 mg x 3 days followed by 40 mg x 7 days; and period 3, both pradigastat 40 mg and a single dose of COC) study involving 24 healthy female subjects of childbearing potential was conducted.The pharmacokinetic parameters of EE were similar when administered alone or in combination with pradigastat, as the 90% confidence interval (CI) of geometric mean ratios for EE exposure (AUC and C(max)) were all within the range of 0.80 - 1.25.

Only a few studies have evaluated the long-term effectiveness of the device for preventing endometrioma recurrence, and the effects of a -releasing intrauterine system as a maintenance therapy remain unclear.The objective of the study was to evaluate whether a maintenance -releasing intrauterine system is effective for preventing postoperative endometrioma recurrence.From May 2011 through March 2012, a randomized controlled trial including 80 patients with endometriomas undergoing laparoscopic cystectomy followed by six cycles of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment was conducted. After surgery, the patients were randomized to groups that did or did not receive a -releasing intrauterine system (intervention group, n = 40, vs control group, n = 40). The primary outcome was endometrioma recurrence 30 months after surgery. The secondary outcomes included dysmenorrhea, CA125 levels, noncyclic pelvic pain, and side effects.Endometrioma recurrence at 30 months did not significantly differ between the 2 groups (the intervention group, 10 of 40, 25% vs the control group 15 of 40, 37.5%; hazard ratio, 0.60, 95% confidence interval, 0.27-1.33, P = .209).

Women have more complex hormonal fluctuations than men and commonly take drugs such as hormonal contraceptives that are shown to affect biomarkers used in these doping tests. In this study, we followed six women's urinary steroid profile during one menstrual cycle, including both glucuronides and sulfate conjugated fractions. Additionally, we studied what happens to the steroidal module of the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) after administration of an emergency contraceptive (, NorLevo®). The study shows that there are large individual variations in all metabolites included in the ABP and that the administration of emergency contraceptives may lead to suspicious steroid profile findings in the ABP. Urinary epitestosterone concentration increased during the menstrual cycle, leading to a decrease in the testosterone/epitestosterone ratio. The ratios followed in the ABP varied widely throughout the menstrual cycle, the coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 4 to 99%. There was a 3-fold decrease in epitestosterone 24 h post administration of the emergency contraceptive pill and androsterone, etiocholanolone, and 5β- androstan-3α,17β-diol concentrations decreased about 2-fold. When analyzed with the ABP software, one of the six women had an atypical profile after taking the emergency contraceptive. Furthermore, we could not find any alterations in excretion routes (i.e., if the metabolites are excreted as glucuronide or sulfate conjugates) during the menstrual cycle or after administration of emergency contraceptive, indicating no direct effect on phase II enzymes.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27473275>Matrix and reservoir-type multipurpose vaginal rings for controlled release of dapivirine and .</a></h2><p>A matrix-type silicone elastomer vaginal ring providing 28-day continuous release of dapivirine (DPV) - a lead candidate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) microbicide compound - has recently demonstrated moderate levels of protection in two Phase III clinical studies.

Modern oral contraceptives contain novel progestins, which are suspected of causing thrombotic events more frequently than well-known progestins. Drospirenone is one of those new fourth-generation progestins with antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid effects. Especially girls and young women do not only wish for contraception, but also for positive effects on skin and . In the last decade, however, the safety of this progestin was often under discussion.A detailed literature search was conducted to obtain an overview of currently available data on the risk of VTE among girls and young women using drospirenone-containing contraceptives. It appears that drospirenone-containing contraceptives have a similar increase in risk as third-generation oral contraceptives and antiandrogens. Compared to second-generation contraceptives containing the progestin  there is an approximate 2-fold risk increase (1.0 to 2.8-fold) in women aged 10-55 years. Accurate data regarding the risk in the age group under 18 years are lacking. Nevertheless, the risk of VTE appears to be higher in young -women during the first months of treatment. Until more data for nov-el progestins are available and the safety profile is well defined well-studied second-generation oral contraceptives with low dose estrogen and better risk-benefit ratio should be preferred in young women.

Serial blood samples were collected and plasma concentrations of midazolam were measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a non-compartmental method.Midazolam clearance, a surrogate measure of CYP3A4/5 activity, was significantly decreased upon COC use (63.3 l h(-1) vs. 53.9 l h(-1), P < 0.05). A median decrease of 5.6 l h(-1) (95% CI -4.1, 13.3 l h(-1)) was observed. However, the magnitude of change was similar to that reported in women with normal BMI.Although we hypothesized that obesity might amplify the impact on CYP3A4/5 activity in COC users, we found that this was not the case.

The active treatment groups achieved serum hormone concentrations, which produced physiological effects on the uterus. No significant differences in serum total cholesterol or ultracentrifuged lipoproteins (very low density, intermediate density, low density, or high density lipoproteins) were found between the four groups during the experimental period. There were no significant differences between the progestogen and placebo groups in the aortic accumulation of cholesterol. The estradiol group had only accumulated about half the aortic cholesterol as compared with the placebo group and the progestogen groups (p less than 0.05).

All three regimens were combined with an oral daily dose of 2mg of E2-valerate.Bleeding patterns were assessed by diaries kept by the subjects. Endometrial effects were evaluated by histologic biopsies taken at the baseline and after six and 12 months of therapy. Serum concentrations of total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein(a) were determined at the baseline and after six and 12 months of therapy.Insertion of the smaller 10 microg  system was easy in 70% and difficult in 4% and that of Mirena was easy in 46% and difficult in 21% of the subjects. After six months of therapy, 43 (95.6%) of the 47 subjects receiving 10 microg  and 54 (98.2%) of the 55 subjects receiving 20 microg  had no bleeding, while the sequential medroxyprogesterone acetate regimen produced typical cyclic withdrawal bleedings. Endometrial hyperplasia was not observed in any of the treatment groups during the 12-month study.

(LNG) is effective as EC only when administered before, but not after ovulation. LNG EC taken in the pre-ovulatory and post-ovulatory phase results in shortening and lengthening of the index menstrual cycle, respectively. Whether the same applies to UPA is not known.Prospective, open-label clinical cohort study conducted on 700 women between May 2011 and March 2014.Seven hundred women requesting EC within 120 h after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse in the index menstrual cycle were recruited at a community family planning clinic in Hong Kong. Each subject received a single oral dose of UPA 30 mg, and 693 of them completed follow-up. Ovulatory status at the time of UPA administration was determined by serum progesterone level supplemented by menstrual history and ultrasound tracking. The main outcome measure was the percentage of pregnancies prevented (PPP).The PPP was significantly higher in subjects who were pre-ovulatory (77.6%) compared with those who were post-ovulatory (36.4%) at the time of UPA administration (P < 0.0001). The observed pregnancy rate following UPA administration was significantly lower than the expected pregnancy rate only in the pre-ovulatory group (P < 0.0001), but not the post-ovulatory group (P = 0.281). The overall failure rate was 1.7% (1.4 versus 2.1% in the pre- and post-ovulatory groups, respectively). Pre-ovulatory administration of UPA resulted in a small delay (median of 3 days), whereas post-ovulatory administration resulted in a minimal advancement (median of 1 day) of the next menstruation, compared with that predicted from previous menstrual pattern. More pre-ovulatory subjects (19.1%) than post-ovulatory subjects (7.8%) had deviation of the next menses of more than 7 days (P < 0.001).The ovulatory status of the subjects was determined based only on menstrual history and a spot sonographic finding together with serum hormonal profile at the time of recruitment.Our findings confirmed comparable efficacy of UPA in the Asian population as in western populations.

Few drugs have been the object of such intensive epidemiological research, the outcome of which has provided clinicians with detailed information about risks not only of specific thrombotic diseases but also important non-contraceptive benefits from the pill. Recently, oral contraceptives have been classified by some according to "generation" (first, second, third, and most recently, fourth generation): first-generation formulations containing lynestrenol or norethindrone, second-generation formulations containing , third-generation formulations containing desogestrel or gestodene, and oral contraceptives containing an estrogen and other progestagens (cyproterone or norgestimate) or a progestagen alone. The results of several study was that the use of the older high-dose oral contraceptives increased the risk of cardiovascular disease by modifying the Low-density lipoprotein and High-Density lipoprotein cholesterol level, increasing triglyceride serum level, reducing glucose tolerance, raising blood pressure, and promoting clotting mechanisms. In this review we investigate the mechanism of the oral contraceptives and performed a risk assessment of every generation.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16354012>Proultraflexible lipid vesicles for effective transdermal delivery of : development, characterization, and performance evaluation.</a></h2><p>The present investigation aimed at formulation, performance evaluation, and stability studies of new vesicular drug carrier system protransfersomes for transdermal delivery of the contraceptive agent, .

The cumulative probability of conception in the remaining 87 women was 25, 49, 73 and 86 percent at one, three, six and twelve months after removal, respectively. Nine observations were censored either because of the use of a contraceptive method soon after removal of the implants (n = 7) or separation (n = 2).

There was no significant correlation between the length of NORPLANT use and the length of the interval from removal to conception. A significantly higher frequency of intervals longer than 6 months was observed among women older than 30 years as compared to younger women. Pathology during pregnancy was cholestasia (n = 5), hypertension (n = 1) and gestational  (n = 1). The outcome was term delivery in 59 cases, premature delivery in 4 cases, and spontaneous abortion in 7 cases. One woman is still pregnant and the outcome is unknown in 4 cases.

Alterations may include decreased glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance, which are risk factors for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. These issues have been raised primarily with contraceptives containing estrogen.To evaluate the effect of hormonal contraceptives on carbohydrate metabolism in healthy women and those at risk for diabetes due to overweight.In April 2014, we searched the computerized databases MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, and LILACS for studies of hormonal contraceptives and carbohydrate metabolism. We also searched for clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. The initial search also included EMBASE.All randomized controlled trials were considered if they examined carbohydrate metabolism in women without diabetes who used hormonal contraceptives for contraception. Comparisons could be a placebo, a non-hormonal contraceptive, or another hormonal contraceptive that differed in drug, dosage, or regimen. Interventions included at least three cycles. Outcomes included glucose and insulin .We assessed all titles and abstracts identified during the literature searches. The data were extracted and entered into RevMan. We wrote to researchers for missing data. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio with 95% CI was calculated.We found 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria. No new trials were eligible in 2014. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. None included a placebo. Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome.Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from  COCs were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose (MD 0.20; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41). Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose (MD -0.40; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.08) and higher means for two-hour glucose response (MD 1.08; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71) and insulin area under the curve (AUC) (MD 20.30; 95% CI 4.24 to 36.36).Three trials examined the etonogestrel vaginal ring and one examined an etonogestrel implant. One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC insulin than the -COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38).Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables. In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a -COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). In an injectable study, a group using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had higher means than the group using norethisterone enanthate for fasting glucose (MD 10.05; 95% CI 3.16 to 16.94), glucose two-hour response (MD 17.00; 95% CI 5.67 to 28.33), and fasting insulin (MD 3.40; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.73).Among five recent trials, two examined newer COCs with different estrogen types. One showed the group with nomegestrel acetate plus 17β-estradiol had lower means than the  group for incremental AUC glucose (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.55 to -0.31) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02). Two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens. With a dienogest COC, an extended-use group had greater mean change in AUC glucose (MD 82.00; 95% CI 10.72 to 153.28). In a small trial using two  COCs, the lower-dose group showed smaller mean change in fasting glucose (MD -3.00; 95% CI -5.89 to -0.11), but the obese and normal  women did not differ significantly.Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without diabetes. We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods.We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had  restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by  mass index (obese versus normal).</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'insulin resistance', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24324023>Plan B emergency contraceptive may be ineffective for heavier women.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27153743>Progestin-only contraception and thromboembolism: A systematic review.</a></h2><p>Women with medical conditions associated with increased risk for thrombosis generally should not use estrogen-containing contraceptives; however, less is known about progestin-only contraceptives (POCs) and thrombosis risk.The objective was to identify evidence regarding the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or arterial thromboembolism [stroke or acute myocardial infarction (AMI)] among women using POCs.We searched the PubMed database for all articles published from database inception through January 2016 for studies examining thrombosis among women using POCs. We included studies which examined women with medical conditions associated with thrombosis risk, as well as studies of women in the general population (either without these conditions or who were not specified to have these conditions). Hormonal contraceptives of interest included progestin-only pills (POPs), injectables, implants and -releasing intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs). Outcomes of interest included VTE, stroke and AMI.There were 26 articles of good to poor quality that met inclusion criteria; 9 studies examined women with medical conditions and 20 examined women in the general population. Two studies found that, among smokers and women with certain thrombogenic mutations, use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) had elevated odds of VTE compared with nonsmokers or those without mutations, although confidence intervals were wide and overlapped with odds among nonusers. One study found that, among women with previous VTE, use of POCs (including DMPA) was associated with a nonsignificant increased odds of recurrent VTE (all of which were among DMPA users); two other studies that examined POCs other than DMPA did not observe an association with recurrent VTE. Two studies found that use of DMPA among healthy women was also associated with increased odds of VTE. Two studies found that use of POCs for therapeutic indications was associated with increased odds of VTE. Studies did not find increased odds of VTE with POPs for contraceptive purposes, implants or LNG-IUDs nor were there increased odds of stroke or AMI with any POCs.The majority of evidence identified by this systematic review did not suggest an increase in odds for venous or arterial events with use of most POCs. Limited evidence suggested increased odds of VTE with use of injectables (three studies) and use of POCs for therapeutic indications (two studies, one with POCs unspecified and the other with POPs). Any increase in risk likely translates to a small increase in absolute numbers of thrombotic events at the population level.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28238536>High salt intake does not aggravate glucose dysregulation and dyslipidemia induced by estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive.</a></h2><p>Estrogen-progestogen combined oral contraceptive (OC) use has been associated with increased cardiometabolic risk factors, including glucose dysregulation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and pro-inflammatory state. However, the effect of a high-salt diet on these risk factors during OC use is not yet investigated. We therefore hypothesized that a high-salt diet would increase cardiometabolic risk factors in female rats treated with a combination of OC steroids,  (L) and ethinylestradiol (EE), and that elevated plasma levels of pro-inflammatory markers are associated with the cardiometabolic effects.Female Wistar rats were given (p.o.) vehicle, high-dose (1.0μg EE plus 5.0μgL) or low-dose (0.1μg EE plus 0.5μgL) OC with or without a high-salt diet (8%) daily for 8 weeks.  (IR) was estimated using the homeostatic model of assessment (HOMA).Results showed that OC treatment or high salt diet led to significant increases in , plasma , total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), TC/HDL-cholesterol, uric acid levels, and decreased glucose tolerance. OC treatment but not a high-salt diet resulted in increased plasma C-reactive protein and TG/HDL-cholesterol. However, a high-salt diet did not aggravate the effects of OC treatment.The results from the present study indicate that glucose dysfunction and dyslipidemia induced by OC use, but not those induced by increased dietary salt are associated with elevated plasma C-reactive protein. Besides, increased dietary salt does not worsen abnormal cardiometabolic impact of OC use.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
