In Exp. 1, 9 barrows (initial BW: 13.08 ± 1.98 kg) were prepared with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and allotted to a triplicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with 3 diets and 3 periods. A nitrogen-free diet and 2 diets that contained corn starch and SPC or SBM as the sole source of CP and AA were formulated. Each period lasted 7 d, and ileal digesta were collected on d 6 and 7 of each period. The SID for , , , Pro, and Tyr was greater ( < 0.05) in SPC than in SBM, but for CP and all other AA, no difference between SPC and SBM was observed. In Exp. 2, 24 barrows (initial BW: 13.94 ± 1.34 kg) were housed individually in metabolism crates and randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diets. A corn-based diet (96.9% corn) and 2 diets that contained corn and SPC or corn and SBM were formulated. Each diet was fed to 8 pigs. Feces and urine samples were collected using the marker to marker method with 5-d adaptation and 5-d collection periods. The DE and ME in SPC and SBM were calculated using the difference procedure. Results indicated that the ATTD of GE was lower ( < 0.05) in SBM than in corn and the DE and ME in SPC were greater ( < 0.01) than in corn and SBM. In Exp. 3, 40 barrows (initial BW: 14.12 ± 2.08 kg) were placed in metabolism crates and allotted to 4 diets in a randomized complete block design with 10 pigs per diet. Two diets were based on SPC or SBM as the sole source of P. Two additional diets were formulated by adding microbial phytase to diets that were otherwise similar to the 2 initial diets. Feces were collected for 5 d after a 5-d adaptation period and values for ATTD and STTD of P were calculated. No differences were observed in ATTD and STTD of P between SPC and SBM, but the ATTD and STTD of P of both SPC and SBM were greater ( < 0.01) if microbial phytase was added to the diets. In conclusion, the concentrations of DE and ME are greater in SPC than in SBM, but the SID of most AA and the STTD of P are not different between SPC and SBM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005070>Fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs exhibit differences in nutrient composition according to body weight and gestational period.</a></h2><p>Low birth weight may negatively affect  storage and nutrient metabolism, and impair fetal growth and development. We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight, fat percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude fat, Gly, Pro, Tyr, C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, , , Lys, , Ser, Thr, essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower Tyr concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30329054>Immune system stimulation induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide alters plasma free amino acid flux and dietary nitrogen utilization in growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Changes in plasma free AA flux reflect the modification of AA metabolism in different metabolic states. Immune system stimulation (ISS) in growing pigs may redistribute AA from protein retention towards processes involved in the immune response, thus impacting AA utilization. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of ISS on whole-body nitrogen (N) utilization and the kinetics of plasma free AA. Ten gilts (BW 9.4 ± 1.1 kg) were surgically fitted with jugular vein catheters, individually housed in metabolism crates, and feed-restricted (550 g/d). Repeated intramuscular injections of increasing amounts of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to induce ISS (30 and 36 µg/kg BW, given 48 h apart). Whole-body N-balance was determined for 3-d before ISS (ISS-) and 3-d during ISS (ISS+). At the end of each N-balance period, a bolus dose of labeled [U-13C, U-15N]-AA mixture (, , Lys, Met, , Thr, Trp, Val, and Gln) was infused intravenously, followed by serial blood collection for determination of isotopic enrichment. A double exponential model was fitted with plasma enrichment data for each pig and each AA, and equation parameters were used to estimate plasma-free AA flux and pool size. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood samples were collected before and 76-h after the initiation of ISS and assayed for hematology and blood chemistry. Body temperature (BT) was monitored during the course of study. Blood chemistry, hematology, and BT results indicated that LPS induced effective ISS in pigs (P < 0.05). ISS tended to reduce N retention (P = 0.09) and the N retention-to-N intake ratio (P = 0.08). Apparent total tract digestibility of dietary  and AID of N were reduced by ISS (P < 0.05). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for  and  was reduced by ISS (P < 0.05). Strong tendencies for decreased Lys flux and N retention were observed in ISS pigs (P < 0.10). ISS increased the pool size for  but reduced the pool size for  (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that ISS alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size in growing pigs. The decrease in Lys, , and  flux during ISS may be attributed to a reduction in whole-body protein synthesis or decreased catabolism of these AA. Relative to other AA, dietary Lys, , and  requirements may decrease in ISS pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26905648>Mechanochromism in the luminescence of novel cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes with α-aminocarboxylates.</a></h2><p>Six novel phosphorescent cyclometalated platinum(ii) complexes with α-aminocarboxylato ligands, [Pt(II)(ppy)L] (ppy = 2-phenylpyridinato, L(-) = Gly, Ala, , , , Sar), were synthesized, and the structures were determined by X-ray crystallography. [Pt(II)(ppy)L] (L(-) = Gly, Ala) in crystals are in monomeric structures and stack through π-π interactions to form columns, and the features of the luminescence are similar to each other and those in solution, suggesting little influence of the π-π interactions on the luminescence. [Pt(II)(ppy)] has a dimeric structure through the Pt-Pt interaction. [Pt(II)(ppy)Sar] showed two pseudo-polymorphs, one of which contains both monomeric and dimeric forms, while the other consists of only dimeric units. Intra-dimer π-π interactions were observed in both the dimeric units. [Pt(II)(ppy)L] (L(-) = , , ) in the solid state displayed different spectral patterns of luminescence from those in solution, suggesting that the dimeric structures through the Pt-Pt interaction in the solid state are dissociated into the corresponding monomeric ones in solution. The complexes except [Pt(II)(ppy)] in the solid state exhibited reversible luminescent mechanochromism in response to the mechanical grinding and treatment with a few drops of solvent. These phenomena are induced by the change in the  level of the triplet state due to the change in the extent of intermolecular interactions, which appeared due to the crystalline-amorphous phase conversion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132296>Nutrient digestibility of multi-enzyme supplemented low- and AA diets for grower pigs1.</a></h2><p>A study was conducted to determine effects of supplementing multi-enzyme on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of  and AA; and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of  for pigs fed low- and AA diets. Eight ileal-cannulated barrows (initial BW: 38.7 ± 2.75 kg) were fed four diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design to give 8 replicates per diet. Diets were positive control (PC) diet, negative control (NC) diet without or with multi-enzyme at 0.5 or 1.0 g/kg. The PC diet was formulated to meet or exceed NRC (2012) nutrient recommendations for grower pigs (25 to 50 kg), except for Ca and digestible P, which were lower than NRC (2012) recommendations by 0.13 and 0.17 percentage points, respectively, due to phytase supplementation at 1,000 FTU/kg. The NC diet was formulated to be lower in NE by 75 kcal/kg and standardized ileal digestible AA content by a mean of 3%. These reductions were achieved by partial replacement of corn and soybean meal (SBM) and complete replacement of soybean oil and monocalcium phosphate in PC diet with 25% corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and 3.6% soybean hulls. Multi-enzyme at 1.0 g/kg supplied 1,900 U of xylanase, 300 U of β-glucanase, 1,300 U of cellulase, 11,500 U of amylase, 120 U of mannanase, 850 U of pectinase, 6,000 U of protease, and 700 U of invertase per kilogram of diet. The AID of GE, N, most AA, most component sugars of nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) and P; ATTD of GE for PC diet was greater (P < 0.05) than those for NC diets. An increase in dietary level of multi-enzyme from 0 to 1.0 g/kg resulted in a linear increase (P < 0.05) in AID of  by 4.3%, and tended to linearly increase (P < 0.10) AID of , Met, , and Val by a mean of 3.4%. Increasing dietary multi-enzyme from 0 to 1.0 g/kg linearly increased (P < 0.05) AID of total NSP and P by 53.7% and 19.2%, respectively; ATTD of GE by 8.4% and DE and NE values by 8.8% and 8.2%, respectively; tended to linearly increase (P < 0.10) AID of GE by 8.1%. The NE values for NC diet with multi-enzyme at 1.0 g/kg tended to be greater (P < 0.10) than that for PC diet (2,337 vs. 2,222 kcal/kg of DM). In conclusion, multi-enzyme supplementation improved  and nutrient digestibilities of a corn-SBM-corn DDGS-based diet, implying that the multi-enzyme fed in the current study can be used to enhance  and nutrient utilization of low- AA diets for grower pigs.© The Author(s) 2019.

A total of 118 Yorkshire sows (third through sixth parity) were randomly assigned to dietary treatments from day 90 of gestation until farrowing. Dietary treatments consisted of combinations of 2 standardized ileal digestible (SID) AA levels [14.7 or 20.6 g/d SID Lys, SID Lys and other AA met or exceeded the NRC (2012) recommendations] and 2  levels (28.24 or 33.78 MJ/d intake of NE) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. After parturition, all sows were fed a standard lactation diet. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for parameters on metabolism, redox status, and amino acid profile. The data were analyzed using the generalized linear mixed models to reveal the impact of dietary levels of , AA, and their interaction. Sows with increased intake of AA had greater BW gain (P < 0.01) during late gestation. Furthermore, the BW loss during lactation was increased in sows with increasing intake of  (P < 0.05) or AA (P < 0.05). Sows fed high  had higher total litter birth weights (20.2 kg vs. 18.4 kg, P < 0.05) and shorter duration of farrowing (261 min vs. 215 min, P < 0.05), compared with those fed low , which likely was due to higher (P < 0.05) plasma glucose and lower (P < 0.05) plasma lactate prior to parturition. High AA intake in late gestation increased the ADG of piglets during the following lactation (P < 0.05), and increased the concentrations of plasma urea, and the following AA: Lys, Met, Thr, Val, , , , Asp, Ser, and Arg at farrowing (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the increased intake of  increased total litter weight of newborns and shortened the farrowing duration, which likely was due to improved  status at farrowing. Furthermore, sows with increased intake of AA led to higher growth rate of piglets during the following lactation, accompanying with the increasing levels of plasma urea and amino acids. Therefore, the higher  intake in late gestation appeared to improve litter weight and farrowing duration, while higher AA intake may have positive effect on piglets performance in lactation.© The Author(s) 2019.

Knowledge-based potential functions are one type of the  functions which can be obtained from known protein structures. The pairwise potential between atom types is approximated using Boltzmann's law which relates the frequency of atom types to its potential. The total  is approximated as a summation of pairwise potential between the atomic pairs. In the present study, the performance of knowledge-based potential function was assessed based on the strength of interaction between groups of amino acids. The dominant energies involved in the pairwise potentials were revealed by eigenvalue analysis of the matrix, the elements of which represent the  between amino acids. For this purpose, the matrix including the mean of the energies of residue-residue interaction types was constructed using 500 native protein structures. The matrix has a dominant eigenvalue and amino acids, with , VAL, , , TYR, ALA and TRP having high values along the dominant eigenvector. The results show that the ranking of amino acids is consistent with the power of amino acids in discriminating native structures using K-alphabet reduced model. In the reduced interactions, only amino acids from a subset of all 20 amino acids, along with their interactions are considered to assess the . In the K-alphabet reduced model, the reduced structures are constructed based on only the K-amino acid types. The dominant K-alphabet reduced model derived for the k-first amino acids in the list [, VAL, , , TYR, ALA, TRP] of amino acids has the best discrimination of native structure among all possible K-alphabet reduced models. Knowledge-based potentials might be improved with a new strategy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29142438>Molecular Simulation-based Combinatorial Modeling and Antioxidant Activities of Zingiberaceae Family Rhizomes.</a></h2><p>The main aim of this scientific report was to investigate a series of phytochemicals  and the pharmacology of four plants found at higher altitude in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae (incl. Costaceae) from North-East India, particularly Sikkim. First, the goal was to determine the biological activities of the four herbs (used under Zingiberaceae family) using antioxidant assays to identify the best species. Second, previously reported compounds  were subsequently screened for their anticancerous activities using  methods.Using the methanolic extracts of herbs, quantitative detection of phytochemicals such as total phenols and total flavonoids was detected, and the free radical scavenging activity was also studied using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Docking process was studied, using Discovery Studio version 3.5, to identify suitable molecules at the protein-binding sites through annealing and genetic simulation algorithms. Grids centered on active sites were obtained with spacing of 54 × 55 × 56, and 0.503 grid spacing was calculated. The methods adopted and used in this study were comparisons of Global and Local Search Methods to determine the parameters such as maximum number of 250,000  evaluations as well as generations of 27,000, followed by mutation and crossover rates of 0.02 and 0.80. The number of docking runs was set to 10. Molecular dynamics study was done to check the stability of the complex.Among all the genus of Zingiberaceae family investigated in this study,  and . exhibited the highest 537 ± 12.45; 292 ± 9.16 mg gallic acid equivalent/g total polyphenols and 38 ± 1.54; 75 ± 6.75 mg quercetin equivalent/g flavonoids, respectively. Depending on the concentration, the  sp. extract exerted the highest scavenging activity on DPPH radical (IC 36.4 μg/mL).  result demonstrated that the synergetic effects of β-phellandrene with other compounds might be responsible for its anticancerous activity. β-phellandrene and farnesene epoxide showed bonding with , Ala, Met, , , , Ala, Glu, Met, , Arg, , , , , His, , and .Based on the current available literature, this is the first study to understand the interaction of compounds found in the rhizomes of Zingiberaceae family.The aqueous methanolic extract of Zingiberaceae family  and . has potent antioxidant activity as assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl assays sp. is understood to possess more active compounds than other varieties studies indicated synergetic effects of β-phellandrene and other compounds for its anticancerous activity.

For accurate inclusion of these products in pig feed, characterization of digestible AA profile and  value is required. Soybean products from processes such as extrusion (EX) of soybean and thermo-mechanical (TM) treatment, bioconversion using fermentation or enzymes (BC), and ethanol-water extraction (EW) of soybean meal were collected together with SBM. These 9 soybean products were tested in cornstarch-based diets together with an N-free diet for a total of 10 diets. Ten ileal-cannulated barrows (30.4 ± 0.7 kg initial BW) were fed 10 diets at 2.8 times maintenance DE for six 9-day periods with a 6 (periods) × 10 (pigs) Youden square. The control SBM contained 47.0% CP, 1.4% ether extract, and ADF 6.0%. The 9 soybean products contained 35.6 to 66.4% CP, 0.9 to 21.6% ether extract, and 4.4 to 8.0% ADF. The EW soybean products were high in CP (> 61%), whereas the 2 EX soybean products were low in CP (< 36%) but high in ether extract (≥ 19%). Chemically-available Lys ranged from 92.6 to 100% of total Lys, indicating that minor Lys damage occurred during processing. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of  was lower (P < 0.05) for soybean products with greater ether extract and ADF content than SBM, and varied among soybean products. The standardized ileal digestibility (SID) did not differ (P > 0.05) among soybean products for most AA, except for lower SID of Arg, , , Lys, , and Tyr (P < 0.05) for EX2 and BC1 than other soybean products. The DE and predicted NE value did not differ (P > 0.05) among soybean products. The greater SID AA content (P < 0.05) in EW, BC, and TM1 soybean products than SBM was mainly a result of greater total AA content due to removal of other macronutrients. In conclusion, extrusion of soybean creates soybean products with a greater  value but lower ATTD of  and lower SID AA content than SBM. Further processing of SBM creates soybean products with greater CP and SID AA content but similar SID of AA than SBM. Thus, new technologies to process SBM or soybean create high value ingredients to be included in pig diets, especially for young pigs with high nutritional requirements.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we study the mechanism of binding/unbinding and compute the free  for the association of the Bim peptide to the BHRF1 protein. Key elements of the binding mechanism are the conformational rearrangement together with a main free  barrier of 11.5kcal/mol. The simulations show complete unbinding and rebinding of the Bim peptide to BHRF1. The peptide slowly dissociates, disrupting the hydrophobic contacts, then tilting to one side. The peptide then completely disrupts all the remaining interactions and moves into the bulk solvent. The rebinding of the peptide from the solvent to the receptor binding site occurs slowly. This is because the helix partially unfolds in the unbound state. Rebinding involves an intermediate state, in which the peptide interacts with the hydrophobic binding pocket, which mainly involves  62, Arg 63,  65, and  69. This novel intermediate structure forms 65 contacts with the receptor before the peptide again reaches the bound state. The standard binding free  value is close to the experimental Kd in the nanomolar range. Finally, we observe how the breathing motions of α3-α4 are coupled with the binding/unbinding of the Bim BH3 peptide. The structure of the intermediate can be used for designing novel peptide inhibitors of the BHRF1 protein.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The observed rate of peptide bond hydrolysis was found to decrease with increase of the side chain bulkiness, from 4.44 × 10(-7) s(-1) for Gly-Gly to 0.81 × 10(-7) s(-1) for Gly-. A thorough DFT investigation was performed to elucidate (a) the nature of the hydrolytically active species in solution, (b) the mechanism of peptide bond hydrolysis, and (c) the influence of the aliphatic residues on the rate of hydrolysis. Formation of substrate-catalyst complexes of the dimeric POM 1 was predicted as thermodynamically unlikely. Instead, the substrates prefer to bind to the monomerization product of 1, [α-PW11O39Zr(OH)(H2O)](4-) (2), which is also present in solution. In the hydrolytically active complex two dipeptide ligands are coordinated to the Zr(IV) center of 2. The first ligand is bidentate-bound through its amino nitrogen and amide oxygen atoms, while the second ligand is monodentate-bound through a carboxylic oxygen atom. The mechanism of hydrolysis involves nucleophilic attack by a solvent water molecule on the amide carbon atom of the bidentate-bound ligand. In this process the uncoordinated carboxylic group of the same ligand acts as a general base to abstract a proton from the attacking water molecule. The decrease of the hydrolysis rate with an increase in the side chain bulkiness is mostly due to the increased ligand conformational strain in the rate-limiting transition state, which elevates the reaction activation . The conformational strain increases first upon substitution of Hα in Gly-Gly with the aliphatic α substituent and second with the β branching of the α substituent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29471545>High-protein distillers dried grains with solubles produced using a novel front-end-back-end fractionation technology has greater nutritional value than conventional distillers dried grains with solubles when fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Two experiments were conducted to determine the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of GE, and DE and ME in conventional distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS-CV) and in a novel source of high-protein distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS-HP) produced by Lincolnway  (Nevada, IA). In Exp. 1, 18 barrows (initial BW: 72.47 ± 9.16 kg) that had a T-cannula installed in the distal ileum were allotted to a completely randomized design with 3 diets and 6 replicate pigs per diet. A nitrogen-free diet and 2 diets that contained cornstarch and DDGS-CV or DDGS-HPLincolnway as the sole source of CP and AA were formulated. Diets were fed to pigs for 7 d, and ileal digesta were collected on days 6 and 7 of each period. The SID for , Lys, Met, , and Glu was greater (P < 0.05) in DDGS-HPLincolnway than in DDGS-CV, and the SID of , Val, and total indispensable AA, as well as the SID of Tyr, tended to be greater (P < 0.10) in DDGS-HPLincolnway than in DDGS-CV. No difference between DDGS-CV and DDGS-HPLincolnway was observed for the SID of CP and all other AA. In Exp. 2, 24 barrows (initial BW: 52.80 ± 2.55 kg) were housed individually in metabolism crates and randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diets. A corn-based basal diet (97.25% corn) and 2 diets that contained corn and DDGS-CV or corn and DDGS-HPLincolnway were formulated. Each diet was fed to 8 pigs. Feces and urine were collected using the marker to marker approach with 7-d adaptation and 5-d collection periods. The DE and ME in DDGS-CV and DDGS-HPLincolnway were calculated using the difference procedure. The DE and ME in DDGS-HPLincolnway on an as-fed basis were greater (P < 0.05) than in corn and DDGS-CV, but the ATTD of GE in DDGS-HPLincolnway and DDGS-CV was less (P < 0.01) than in corn. In conclusion, the SID of some AA and the DE and ME in DDGS-HPLincolnway were greater than in DDGS-CV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25595103>Computational identification and binding analysis of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 enzyme with substrates.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are important heme-containing proteins, well known for their monooxygenase reaction. The human cytochrome P450 4X1 (CYP4X1) is categorized as "orphan" CYP because of its unknown function. In recent studies it is found that this enzyme is expressed in neurovascular functions of the brain. Also, various studies have found the expression and activity of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 in cancer. It is found to be a potential drug target for cancer therapy. However, three-dimensional structure, the active site topology and substrate specificity of CYP4X1 remain unclear.In the present study, the three-dimensional structure of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated by homology modeling using Modeller 9v8. The generated structure was accessed for geometrical errors and  stability using PROCHECK, VERFIY 3D and PROSA. A molecular docking analysis was carried out against substrates arachidonic acid and anandamide and the docked substrates were predicted for drug-likeness, ADME-Tox parameters and biological spectrum activity.The three-dimensional model of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated and assessed with various structural validation programmes. Docking of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 with arachidonic acid revealed that TYR 112, ALA 126,  222,  223, THR 312,  315, ALA 316, ASP 319, THR 320,  491 and  492 residues were actively participating in the interaction, while docking of CYP4X1 with anandamide showed that TYR 112, GLN 114, PRO 118, ALA 126,  222,  223, SER 251,  315, ALA 316 and  491 key residues were involved in strong interaction.From this study, several key residues were identified to be responsible for the binding of arachidonic acid and anandamide with orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1. Both substrates obeyed Lipinski rule of five in drug-likeness test and biological spectrum prediction showed anticarcinogenic activity. Compared to anandamide, arachidonic acid showed strong interaction with cytochrome P450 4X1 and also less health effect in certain human system in ADME-Tox prediction.

Analysis of the spectral data matrices by using the multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm resulted to the pure concentration calculation and spectral profiles resolution of the chemical constituents and the values of (6.433±0.019)×10(4)M(-1), (4.532±0.007)×10(4)M(-1), (3.364±0.010)×10(4)M(-1) and (2.977±0.013)×10(4)M(-1) as estimated equilibrium constants at 288, 293, 298 and 303K, respectively. The number of chemical constituents involved in the interaction which was extracted by PCA method were free and bound BLG. The spontaneity of the binding process and critical role of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions in stabilizing protein-ligand complex have been designated by negative values of Gibbs free , entropy and enthalpy changes. Molecular docking study showed that AA-5HT binds to Val(41), (39), (54), (71), (82), Asn(90), Val(92), (105), Met(107), Glu(108) with the free binding  of -37.478kJ/mol. Computational studies predicted that in spite of serotonin (5HT) which anchors to the outer surface of BLG by hydrogen bonds, AA-5HT is situated in the calyx pose and stayed there during the entire time of simulation. This binding is accompanying with no apparent influence on secondary structure and partially destabilization of tertiary structure of BLG which pointed the suitability of this protein as drug carrier for AA-5HT.Copyright © 2016.

The selected mono-amino acid derivatives Ac-X-OMe, where X = Gly, Val, , , , Met, Cys, Ser, Asp and His as well as their corresponding N-methylated analogues were studied. The clog P values of all N-methylated peptides are greater than those of native compounds. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to estimate the aqueous solubility of these lipophilic compounds using density functional theory (DFT). To confirm the contribution of dispersion forces on quantum chemical data, the long-range corrected (LC) hybrid density functional (ωB97X-D) was also probed for some amino acid derivatives. The ωB97X functional gave similar results. Our results reveal that after mono N-methylation of the peptide backbone, ΔGsolv becomes more negative (more water soluble) while polarizability and dipole moment are also increased. Natural atomic charges derived by natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis of N, C, and O atoms involved in amide functional group become more positive/(less negative) after N-methylation. All N-methylated amino acids have higher EHOMO (less negative) in comparison with the amino acid analogues, and in all cases N-methylation decreases EHOMO-LUMO. The calculated amide cis/trans activation energies (EA) of all the N-methylated amino acid derivatives were lower than that of native species. N-methylation of these compounds leads to an increase in lipophilicity, aqueous solubility, polarization, dipole moment and lowering of the cis/trans amide  barrier (EA).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28201818>Collective repacking reveals that the structures of protein cores are uniquely specified by steric repulsive interactions.</a></h2><p>Protein core repacking is a standard test of protein modeling software. A recent study of six different modeling software packages showed that they are more successful at predicting side chain conformations of core compared to surface residues. All the modeling software tested have multicomponent  functions, typically including contributions from solvation, electrostatics, hydrogen bonding and Lennard-Jones interactions in addition to statistical terms based on observed protein structures. We investigated to what extent a simplified  function that includes only stereochemical constraints and repulsive hard-sphere interactions can correctly repack protein cores. For single residue and collective repacking, the hard-sphere model accurately recapitulates the observed side chain conformations for , , , Thr, Trp, Tyr and Val. This result shows that there are no alternative, sterically allowed side chain conformations of core residues. Analysis of the same set of protein cores using the Rosetta software suite revealed that the hard-sphere model and Rosetta perform equally well on , , , Thr and Val; the hard-sphere model performs better on Trp and Tyr and Rosetta performs better on Ser. We conclude that the high prediction accuracy in protein cores obtained by protein modeling software and our simplified hard-sphere approach reflects the high density of protein cores and dominance of steric repulsion.© The Author 2017.

The dietary treatments were corn-soybean meal based diets: 1) T1, control diet; 2) T2, T1 + 20 g/kg GL; 3) T3, T1 + 40 g/kg GL; 4) T4, T1 + 60 g/kg GL; 5) T5, T1 + 0.4 g/kg EGB; 6) T6, T1 + 0.8 g/kg EGB; and 7) T7, T1 + 1.2 g/kg EGB. Endogenous losses were obtained from another 16 broilers. Excreta samples were collected to analyze the dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), ether extract (EE), crude protein (CP), gross  (GE), and amino acids (AA), and GE was analyzed for computation of AME and TME. As compared with those of the control treatment, the apparent digestibility (AD) and true digestibility (TD) of EE, CP, Thr, Val, , , , Lys, His, and Arg were quadratically (P < 0.05) increased; moreover, the AD and TD of Met was linearly (P < 0.05) increased as the concentration of the EGB in the diet increased. Increasing GL from 0 to 60 g/kg of diet linearly (P < 0.05) increased the AD and TD of EE, Thr, Val, , His, and Met and tended (0.05 < P < 0.1) to increase the TME, TMEn, and Arg. Supplementation of EGB increased (P < 0.05) AD and TD of EE, Thr, Val, , , , His, and Arg and tended (0.05 < P < 0.1) to increase Lys as compared with those in the GL-supplemented groups. Dietary supplementation of GL and EGB improved the utilization of nutrients of broiler chickens in a dose-dependent manner, and the optimum supplementation levels of GL or EGB in the diet of broilers was 60 or 0.8 g/kg of diet, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062849>Immune system stimulation induced by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus alters plasma free amino acid flux and dietary nitrogen utilization in starter pigs1.</a></h2><p>Changes in plasma free amino acid (AA) flux reflect the modification of AA metabolism in different metabolic states. Infectious diseases repartition AA away from protein retention toward processes involved in immune defense, thus impacting AA utilization in pigs. The current study sought to evaluate the effects of disease induced by a live pathogen on plasma free AA flux and whole-body nitrogen (N) utilization. Twenty gilts (BW 9.4 ± 0.9 kg) were surgically catheterized into the jugular vein, individually housed in metabolism crates, and feed-restricted (550 g/d). Intramuscular inoculation of a live field strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was used to induce disease. Whole-body N-balance was conducted across 3 d both before PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV-) and also after PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV+). At the end of each N-balance period, a bolus dose of a labeled [U-13C, U-15N]-AA mixture (, , Lys, Met, , Thr, Trp, Val, and Gln) was infused intravenously, followed by serial blood collection for measurement of isotopic enrichment. A double exponential model was fitted with plasma enrichment data for each pig and each AA, and equation parameters were used to estimate plasma free AA flux and pool size. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of dietary N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood chemistry, hematology, body temperature, and serum viremia indicated that PRRSV induced effective immune response in pigs (P < 0.05). Challenge with PRRSV reduced the AID of N (P < 0.05), but had no effect on apparent total tract digestibility of dietary  (P = 0.12). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for Met and Thr was increased by PRRSV infection (P < 0.05). A strong tendency of increased Val flux was observed in PRRSV+ pigs (P = 0.06). Infection with PRRSV increased the pool size for Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, , Val, and Gln (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that PRRSV alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size, in growing pigs. The increase in Thr and Met flux in PRRSV+ pigs may be associated with enhanced utilization of these AA for the synthesis of immune system metabolites and increased catabolism of these AA. Thus, dietary Met, Thr, and Val requirements may increase in pigs infected with PRRSV, relative to the requirements for other AA.© The Author(s) 2019.

This study determined the effect of different AA profiles within a constant supplemental MP level on whole-body  and N partitioning in dairy cattle. Five rumen-fistulated Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (2.8 ± 0.4 lactations; 81 ± 11 d in milk; mean ± standard deviation) were randomly assigned to a 5 × 5 Latin square design in which each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous abomasal infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration consisting of 58% corn silage, 16% alfalfa hay, and 26% concentrate (dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net  and MP requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Abomasal infusion treatments were saline (SAL) or 562 g/d of essential AA delivered in 4 profiles where individual AA content corresponded to their relative content in casein. The profiles were (1) a complete essential amino acid mixture (EAAC), (2) , , and Val (ILV), (3) His, , , Met, , Trp, Val (GR1+ILV), and (4) Arg, His, Lys, Met, , Thr, Trp (GR1+ALT). The experiment was conducted in climate respiration chambers to determine  and N balance in conjunction with milk production and composition, digestibility, and plasma constituents. Compared with SAL, infusion of EAAC increased milk, protein, and lactose yield, increased  retained as body protein, and did not affect milk N efficiency. Total N intake and urine N output was higher with all AA infusions relative to SAL. Compared with EAAC, infusions of GR1+ILV and GR1+ALT produced the same milk yield and the same yield and content of milk fat, protein, and lactose, and had similar  and N retention. Milk N efficiency was not different between EAAC and GR1+ILV, but was lower with GR1+ALT compared with EAAC, and tended to be lower with GR1+ALT compared with GR1+ILV. Infusion of ILV tended to decrease dry matter intake compared with the other AA infusions. Milk production and composition was not different between ILV and SAL. Compared with EAAC, infusion of ILV decreased or tended to decrease milk, protein, and lactose yields and milk protein content, and increased milk fat and lactose content. Milk N efficiency decreased with ILV compared with SAL, EAAC, and GR1+ILV. Milk urea concentration was not affected by essential amino acid (EAA) infusions. Plasma urea concentration did not differ between EAAC and SAL, tended to increase with ILV and GR1+ILV over SAL, and increased with GR1+ALT compared with EAAC and SAL. In conclusion, removing Arg, Lys, and Thr or removing , , and Val from a complete EAA profile when the total amount of EAA infused remained constant did not impair milk production, but milk N efficiency decreased when , , and Val were absent. Infusion of only , , and Val decreased milk protein yield and content and reduced milk N efficiency compared with a complete EAA profile.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In Exp. 1, 15 ileal-cannulated pigs (50.5 ± 2.9 kg BW) were allotted to 5 diets in a 2-period incompletely randomized design. Pigs were provided a cornstarch N-free diet (CST) or a diet containing 5% inulin (INU), carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), or Solka-Floc (SFC). Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of DM, ash, and GE were greater ( < 0.05) in the MCC and SFC diets than in the INU and CMC diets. Apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, carbohydrates (CHO), and GE and the DE content in the CST and INU diets were greater ( < 0.01) than in the CMC, MCC, and SFC diets. Hindgut disappearance of DM, CHO, and GE in the INU diet was greater ( < 0.05) than in the other N-free diets. The ileal endogenous flow of His, , , Met, Thr, Val, and all dispensable AA in the CMC diet was greater ( < 0.05) than in the other diets. In Exp. 2, 6 ileal-cannulated pigs were allotted to 3 diets containing either a corn-soybean meal control diet or the control diet with 5% INU or CMC in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design. Standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Ala, Arg, Asp, Cys, Gly, His, , , Lys, , Ser, Thr, and Val were greater ( < 0.05) in the CMC diet than in the control and INU diets. Incorporation of 5% INU or CMC in the control diet reduced ( < 0.01) the AID of arabinoxylan and insoluble and total NSP. The ATTD of NSP and cellulose and the hindgut disappearance of NSP, β-glucan, and cellulose in the CMC diet were less ( < 0.01) than in the control and INU diets. Inclusion of 5% INU in the diet increased ( < 0.01) hindgut fermentation of insoluble and total NSP compared with the control and CMC diets. In conclusion, depending on the viscosity and fermentability of the NSP, different sources will have different effects on nutrient digestibility and hindgut fermentation. Addition of 5% INU to a corn-soybean meal diet reduced digestibility of the NSP component in the ileum and increased hindgut fermentation of total NSP. In contrast, the inclusion of CMC increased the AID and SID of the diet and reduced total tract digestion and hindgut fermentation of NSP component. Carboxymethylcellulose sodium is not recommended as a source of synthetic fiber in a N-free diet to determine the SID of AA of diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25568365>The efficacy of a new 6-phytase obtained from Buttiauxella spp. expressed in Trichoderma reesei on digestibility of amino acids, , and nutrients in pigs fed a diet based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers' dried grains with solubles.</a></h2><p>Sixteen cannulated pigs were used to evaluate the effect of a new 6-phytase derived from Buttiauxella spp. and expressed in Trichoderma reesei on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of AA and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, N, Ca, P, Na, Mg, K, Cl, and . Pigs were fed 4 diets for 2 periods in a crossover design. Within each period, there were 4 blocks of 4 pigs per block with each diet represented within each block. The average initial BW in periods 1 and 2 were 22 and 30 kg, respectively. Each period lasted 9 d with fecal collection on d 5 and 6 and a 12-h ileal digesta collection on d 7, 8, and 9. Pigs received a daily feed allowance of approximately 4.5% of their BW. The experimental diets were based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers dried grain with solubles. Phytase was added at 0; 500; 1,000; or 2,000 phytase units/kg of diet to a basal diet that contained 205, 15, 5.4, and 10 g of CP, Lys, total P (1.6 g of nonphytate P), and Ca/kg diet, respectively. The addition of phytase improved (P < 0.05) AID of DM, N, Ca, and P. Increasing phytase supplementation linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05) AID of P and Ca, respectively, with AID of Ca showing a tendency for a linear increase (P = 0.053). Phytase supplementation of the basal diet improved (P < 0.05) AID of P from 46 to 62%. Phytase supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ATTD of DM, N, Ca, P, Mg, K, and . Contrasts showed that phytase supplementation of the basal diet increased (P < 0.05) AID for 8 indispensable AA (Arg, His, , , Lys, , Thr, and Val), 6 dispensable AA (Ala, Asp, Cys, Glu, Ser, and Tyr), as well as for total AA. Furthermore, phytase supplementation to the basal diet showed a tendency (P < 0.10) to increase ileal digestibility of Gly. Ileal digestibility of Met, Trp, and Pro were not affected by phytase supplementation. Increasing the level of phytase supplementation resulted in linear increases (P < 0.05) in AID of 6 indispensable AA (Arg, , , Lys, , and Val) and 1 dispensable AA (Asp) with 4 AA (His, Cys, Glu, and Tyr) showing a tendency for linear increase (P < 0.10) in AID of AA. The results from this study showed that in addition to increasing P and Ca utilization, the new Buttiauxella 6-phytase expressed in Trichoderma reesei enhanced ileal digestibility of N and several AA in growing pigs in a dose-dependent manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28669348>The Structural Bioinformatics analysis of Biophenolic Lignan-Estrogen Receptor interaction.</a></h2><p>Plant lignans have proven efficacious in blocking estrogen receptors of breast cancer cells. However, available studies have mostly dealt with anti-cancer effects of groups of lignans in certain foods or plants and the effects of specific lignans, especially from a molecular interaction viewpoint, has been rarely addressed in the literature.We aimed to computationally predict the binding ability and binding strength of pinoresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol and secoisolariciresinol as potent ligands of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α), in order to study these lignans as drugs.Blind Docking method was utilized to predict the binding orientation of lignans to their targets by AutoDock 4.2 software. Docking results of lignan-receptor complexes were compared to tamoxifen-receptor complex separately. Hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds between lignans and ER were perused and the binding  was calculated.The best binding affinity of tamoxifen, matairesinol, pinoresinol, lariciresinol and secoisolariciresinol were respectively -8.7, -7.5, -6.7, -6.7, -5.8 kcal/mol, and matairesinol showed the minimum binding  than other studied lignans. Matairesinol showed the most similar interactions with tamoxifen with small molecule-receptor complex in the following residues: :391, Ala:350, :424 and :404.Among the studied lignans, matairesinol showed the least binding  as well as the most similar hydrophobic interactions to tamoxifen suggesting that matairesinol can display more efficacious biological activity to inhibit ER in comparison with pinoresinol, lariciresinol and secoisolariciresinol. Thus, our results introduce matairesinol as a potentially effective anti-ER drug.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250878>Postprandial insulin and nutrient concentrations in lipopolysaccharide-challenged growing pigs reared in thermoneutral and high ambient temperatures1.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the associated effects of ambient temperature and inflammation caused by repeated administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on insulin, , and AA metabolism. Twenty-eight pigs were assigned to one of the two thermal conditions: thermoneutral (24 °C) or high ambient temperature (30 °C). The experimental period lasted 17 d, which was divided into a 7-d period without LPS (days -7 to -1), and a subsequent 10-d LPS period (days 1 to 10) in which pigs were administered 5 repeated injections of LPS at 2-d intervals. Postprandial profiles of plasma insulin and nutrients were evaluated through serial blood samples taken on days -4 (P0), 4 (P1), and 8 (P2). Before the LPS-challenge (P0), postprandial concentrations of glucose, lactate, Gln, , , , Tyr, and Val were greater in pigs kept at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). In contrast, Arg, Asp, Gly, His, and Met postprandial concentrations at P0 were lower at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). At both 24 and 30 °C conditions, pigs had greater postprandial concentrations of insulin (P < 0.01) and lower concentrations of NEFA (P < 0.01) and α-amino nitrogen (P < 0.05) at P1 and P2 than at P0. Compared with P0, postprandial concentrations of glucose were greater (P < 0.05) at P1 in pigs kept at 24 °C, and at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 30 °C. At both ambient temperatures, pigs had lower (P < 0.05) postprandial concentrations of Ala, Gly, His, , , Pro, Ser, Thr, Trp, and Val at P1 and P2 than at P0. Arginine postprandial concentration at P1 was lower than at P0 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was observed in pigs at 30 °C. Relative to P0, Gln and Tyr concentrations were lower at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.01), whereas lower Gln concentration was observed only at P2 (P < 0.01) and lower Tyr only at P1 (P < 0.01) in pigs kept at 30 °C. Our study shows a hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic state in LPS-challenged pigs and a greater magnitude of this response in pigs kept at 30 °C. Furthermore, LPS caused important changes in BCAA, His, Thr, and Trp profiles, suggesting the role these AA in supporting the inflammatory response. Finally, our results suggest that LPS-induced effects on postprandial profiles of specific AA (Arg, Gln, , and Tyr) may be modulated by ambient temperature.© The Author(s) 2019.
