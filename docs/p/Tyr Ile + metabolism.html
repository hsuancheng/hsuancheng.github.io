In Exp. 1, 9 barrows (initial BW: 13.08 ± 1.98 kg) were prepared with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and allotted to a triplicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with 3 diets and 3 periods. A nitrogen-free diet and 2 diets that contained corn starch and SPC or SBM as the sole source of CP and AA were formulated. Each period lasted 7 d, and ileal digesta were collected on d 6 and 7 of each period. The SID for , Leu, Phe, Pro, and  was greater ( < 0.05) in SPC than in SBM, but for CP and all other AA, no difference between SPC and SBM was observed. In Exp. 2, 24 barrows (initial BW: 13.94 ± 1.34 kg) were housed individually in  crates and randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diets. A corn-based diet (96.9% corn) and 2 diets that contained corn and SPC or corn and SBM were formulated. Each diet was fed to 8 pigs. Feces and urine samples were collected using the marker to marker method with 5-d adaptation and 5-d collection periods. The DE and ME in SPC and SBM were calculated using the difference procedure. Results indicated that the ATTD of GE was lower ( < 0.05) in SBM than in corn and the DE and ME in SPC were greater ( < 0.01) than in corn and SBM. In Exp. 3, 40 barrows (initial BW: 14.12 ± 2.08 kg) were placed in  crates and allotted to 4 diets in a randomized complete block design with 10 pigs per diet. Two diets were based on SPC or SBM as the sole source of P. Two additional diets were formulated by adding microbial phytase to diets that were otherwise similar to the 2 initial diets. Feces were collected for 5 d after a 5-d adaptation period and values for ATTD and STTD of P were calculated. No differences were observed in ATTD and STTD of P between SPC and SBM, but the ATTD and STTD of P of both SPC and SBM were greater ( < 0.01) if microbial phytase was added to the diets. In conclusion, the concentrations of DE and ME are greater in SPC than in SBM, but the SID of most AA and the STTD of P are not different between SPC and SBM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28887533>Creation and Initial Characterization of Isogenic Helicobacter pylori CagA EPIYA Variants Reveals Differential Activation of Host Cell Signaling .</a></h2><p>The polymorphic CagA toxin is associated with Helicobacter pylori-induced disease. Previous data generated using non-isogenic strains and transfection models suggest that variation surrounding the C-terminal Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA) motifs as well as the number of EPIYA motifs influence disease outcome. To investigate potential CagA-mediated effects on host cell signaling, we constructed and characterized a large panel of isogenic H. pylori strains that differ primarily in the CagA EPIYA region. The number of EPIYA-C motifs or the presence of an EPIYA-D motif impacted early changes in host cell elongation; however, the degree of elongation was comparable across all strains at later time points. In contrast, the strain carrying the EPIYA-D motif induced more IL-8 secretion than any other EPIYA type, and a single EPIYA-C motif induced comparable IL-8 secretion as isolates carrying multiple EPIYA-C alleles. Similar levels of ERK1/2 activation were induced by all strains carrying a functional CagA allele. Together, our data suggest that polymorphism in the CagA C-terminus is responsible for differential alterations in some, but not all, host cell signaling . Notably, our results differ from non-isogenic strain studies, thus highlighting the importance of using isogenic strains to study the role of CagA toxin polymorphism in gastric cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27271345>Specific affinity-labeling of the nociceptin ORL1 receptor using a thiol-activated Cys(Npys)-containing peptide ligand.</a></h2><p>We previously showed that an antagonist-based peptide ligand, H-Cys(Npys)-Arg---Arg- -Lys-NH2 , captures the free thiol groups in the ligand-binding site of the nociceptin receptor ORL1. However, the exact receptor sites of this thiol-disulfide exchange reaction have not been uncovered, although such identification would help to clarify the ligand recognition site. Since the Cys→Ala substitution prevents the reaction, we performed the so-called Ala scanning for all the Cys residues in the transmembrane (TM) domains of the ORL1 receptor. Seven different mutant receptors were soundly expressed in the COS-7 cells and examined for their specific affinity labeling by a competitive binding assay using nociceptin and [(3) H]nociceptin. The results of in vitro Ala scanning analyses revealed that the labeled residues were Cys59 in TM1, Cys215 and Cys231 in TM5, and Cys310 in TM7. The present study has provided a novel method of Cys(Npys)-affinity labeling for identification of the ligand-binding sites in the ORL1 receptor.© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Despite the importance of GPCRs in human physiology and pharmacotherapy, little is known about the molecular details of the TIP39-PTH interaction. To address this, we utilised the different pharmacological profiles of TIP39 and PTH(1-34) at PTH and its related receptor PTH: TIP39 being an agonist at the former but an antagonist at the latter, while PTH(1-34) activates both. A total of 23 site-directed mutations of PTH, in which residues were substituted to the equivalent in PTH were made and pharmacologically screened for agonist activity. Follow-up mutations were analysed by radioligand binding and cAMP assays. A model of the TIP39-PTH complex was built and analysed using molecular dynamics. Only Tyr318- displayed reduced TIP39 potency, despite having increased PTH(1-34) potency, and further mutagenesis and analysis at this site demonstrated that this was due to reduced TIP39 affinity at Tyr318- (pIC=6.01±0.03) compared with wild type (pIC=7.81±0.03). The hydroxyl group of the -318's side chain was shown to be important for TIP39 binding, with the Tyr318-Phe mutant displaying 13-fold lower affinity and 35-fold lower potency compared with wild type. TIP39 truncated by up to 5 residues at the N-terminus was still sensitive to the mutations at -318, suggesting that it interacts with a region within TIP39(6-39). Molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the selectivity is based on an interaction between the -318 hydroxyl group with the carboxylate side chain of Asp-7 of the peptide.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).

We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight, fat percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude fat, Gly, Pro, , C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, , Leu, Lys, Phe, Ser, Thr, essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower  concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25625371>Influence of candidate polymorphisms on the dipeptidyl peptidase IV and μ-opioid receptor genes expression in aspect of the β-casomorphin-7 modulation functions in autism.</a></h2><p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with population prevalence of approximately 60-70 per 10,000. Data shows that both opioid system function enhancement and opiate administration can result in autistic-like symptoms. Cow milk opioid peptides, including β-casomorphin-7 (BCM7, -Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-), affect the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and are subjected to degradation resulting from the proline dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC 3.4.14.5) enzyme activity. The presence of MOR and DPPIV activity are crucial factors determining biological activity of BCM7 in the human body. Our study examined the effect of β-casomorphin-7 on the MOR and DPPIV genes expression according to specific point mutations in these genes. In addition, we investigated frequency of A118G SNP in the MOR gene and rs7608798 of the DPPIV (A/G) gene in healthy and autistic children. Our research indicated correlation in DPPIV gene expression under the influence of BCM7 and hydrolyzed milk between healthy and ASD-affected children with genotype GG (P<0.0001). We also observed increased MOR gene expression in healthy children with genotype AG at polymorphic site A118G under influence of BCM7 and hydrolyzed milk. The G allele frequency was 0.09 in MOR gene and 0.68 in the DPPIV gene. But our results suggest no association between presence of the alleles G and A at position rs7608798 in DPPIV gene nor alleles A and G at position A118G of the MOR and increased incidence of ASD. Our studies emphasize the compulsion for genetic analysis in correlation with genetic factors affecting development and enhancement of autism symptoms.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The antioxidant activities of recovered peptide fractions were evaluated. Four novel antioxidant peptides that were isolated from nanofiltration retentate exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, using gel chromatography and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequences of isolated peptides were identified as -Glu-Asn-Gly-Gly (P2), Glu-Gly--Pro-Trp-Asn (P4), --Val--Pro-Gly (P7) and Trp-Gly-Asp-Ala-Gly-Gly-- (P8) with molecular weights of 538.46, 764.75, 710.78 and 887.85 Da, respectively. P2, P4, P7 and P8 exhibited good scavenging activities on hydroxyl radical (IC 0.41, 0.327, 0.17 and 0.042 mg/ml), DPPH radical (IC 0.666, 0.326, 0.451 and 0.377 mg/ml) and superoxide radical (IC 0.536, 0.307, 0.357 and 0.115 mg/ml).

An experiment was conducted to analyze the serum concentrations (SC) of free AA in pigs exposed to diurnal variations in AT. Six pigs (27.1 ±1.3kg body weight) implanted with a thermometer to register the body temperature (BT) at 15-min intervals were used. Blood samples were collected on the last 3 d of the 14-d study, at 0700h (lowest AT), 1200h (mild HS), and 1600h (severe HS). The pigs received 1.2kg/d of an AA-supplemented, wheat-soybean meal diet, in two equal meals (0700 and 1900h). The AT and BT, recorded at 0700, 1200, and 1600h was: 30.6, 38.6, 41.1°C, and 38.2, 39.5, 40.3°C, respectively. The BT was significantly correlated (P < 0.001) with the AT. The SC (μM/mL) of , Lys, Met, Val, Ala, Asn, and Pro were higher (P ≤ 0.01); Arg, Phe, Glu, and  tended to be higher (P ≤ 0.10); but Cys was lower (P < 0.05) at 1200h than at 0700h. Lys was higher, Cys and  were lower (P < 0.05), and  and Val tended to be higher (P ≤ 0.10) at 1600h than at 0700h. Serum Arg, , Phe, Ala, Asn, Gln, Pro, Ser, and  were lower (P < 0.05), and Leu and Val tended to be lower at 1600h than at 1200h. These data demonstrate that AT directly alters the BT of pigs, and that diurnal variations in AT differently affect their SC and availability of AA for growth.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The small changes in the substituents of the coumarin moiety led to this interesting selectivity profile. The most potent selective hMAO-B inhibitor D7 has a selectivity ratio of 20.93, with an IC₅₀ value of 2.78 μM, similar or better than selegiline (IC₅₀ = 2.89 μM), a selective hMAO-B inhibitor currently in the market for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Our modeling study indicates that  326 of hMAO-B (or corresponded  335 of hMAO-A) may be the determinant for the specificity of these compounds. The selectivity profile of compounds reported herein suggests that we can further develop both selective hMAO-A and hMAO-B inhibitors based on this novel scaffold.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This channel is regulated by a number of accessory proteins including fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14), a member of the intracellular FGF family. In addition to forming homodimers, FGF14 binds directly to the Nav1.6 channel C-tail, regulating channel gating and expression, properties that are required for intrinsic excitability in neurons. Seeking amino acid residues with unique roles at the protein-protein interaction interface (PPI) of FGF14·Nav1.6, we engineered model-guided mutations of FGF14 and validated their impact on the FGF14·Nav1.6 complex and the FGF14:FGF14 dimer formation using a luciferase assay. Divergence was found in the β-9 sheet of FGF14 where an alanine (Ala) mutation of Val-160 impaired binding to Nav1.6 but had no effect on FGF14:FGF14 dimer formation. Additional analysis revealed also a key role of residues Lys-74/-76 at the N-terminal of FGF14 in the FGF14·Nav1.6 complex and FGF14:FGF14 dimer formation. Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrated that either the FGF14(V160A) or the FGF14(K74A/I76A) mutation was sufficient to abolish the FGF14-dependent regulation of peak transient Na(+) currents and the voltage-dependent activation and steady-state inactivation of Nav1.6; but only V160A with a concomitant alanine mutation at -158 could impede FGF14-dependent modulation of the channel fast inactivation. Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy of purified proteins confirmed a stronger binding reduction of FGF14(V160A) to the Nav1.6 C-tail compared with FGF14(K74A/I76A) Altogether these studies indicate that the β-9 sheet and the N terminus of FGF14 are well positioned targets for drug development of PPI-based allosteric modulators of Nav channels.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25425280>CXCR3 antagonist VUF10085 binds to an intrahelical site distinct from that of the broad spectrum antagonist TAK-779.</a></h2><p>The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is implicated in a variety of clinically important diseases, notably rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. Consequently, antagonists of CXCR3 are of therapeutic interest. In this study, we set out to characterize binding sites of the specific low MW CXCR3 antagonist VUF10085 and the broad spectrum antagonist TAK-779 which blocks CXCR3 along with CCR2 and CCR5.Molecular modelling of CXCR3, followed by virtual ligand docking, highlighted several CXCR3 residues likely to contact either antagonist, notably a conserved aspartate in helix 2 (Asp-112(2:63) ), which was postulated to interact with the quaternary nitrogen of TAK-779. Validation of modelling was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis of CXCR3, followed by assays of cell surface expression, ligand binding and receptor activation.Mutation of Asn-132(3.33) , Phe-207 and -271(6.51) within CXCR3 severely impaired both ligand binding and chemotactic responses, suggesting that these residues are critical for maintenance of a functional CXCR3 conformation. Contrary to our hypothesis, mutation of Asp-112(2:63) had no observable effects on TAK-779 activity, but clearly decreased the antagonist potency of VUF 10085. Likewise, mutations of Phe-131(3.32) , -279(6.59) and -308(7.43) were well tolerated and were critical for the antagonist activity of VUF 10085 but not for that of TAK-779.This more detailed definition of a binding pocket within CXCR3 for low MW antagonists should facilitate the rational design of newer CXCR3 antagonists, with obvious clinical potential.© 2014 The Authors.

Recent studies have disclosed that the conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) of eukaryotic ribosomal P stalk proteins is involved in the process that RIPs target ribosome. However, the details of the molecular interaction between ricin and P stalk proteins remain unknown. Here, we report the structure of ricin-A chain (RTA) in a complex with the CTD of the human ribosomal protein P2. The structure shows that the Phe, Leu and Phe residues of P2 insert into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the , Arg, Phe and  residues of RTA, while Asp of P2 forms hydrogen bonds with Arg of RTA. The key residues in RTA and P2 for complex formation were mutated, and their importance was determined by pull-down assays. The results from cell-free translation assays further confirmed that the interaction with P stalk proteins is essential for the inhibition of protein synthesis by RTA. Taken together, our results provide a structural basis that will improve our understanding of the process by which ricin targets the ribosome, which will benefit the development of effective small-molecule inhibitors for use as therapeutic agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27154022>Cis→Trans Isomerization of Pro(7) in Oxytocin Regulates Zn(2+) Binding.</a></h2><p>Ion mobility/mass spectrometry techniques are employed to investigate the binding of Zn(2+) to the nine-residue peptide hormone oxytocin (OT, Cys(1)-(2)-(3)-Gln(4)-Asn(5)-Cys(6)-Pro(7)-Leu(8)-Gly(9)-NH2, having a disulfide bond between Cys(1) and Cys(6) residues). Zn(2+) binding to OT is known to increase the affinity of OT for its receptor [Pearlmutter, A. F., Soloff, M. S.: Characterization of the metal ion requirement for oxytocin-receptor interaction in rat mammary gland membranes. J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3899-3906 (1979)]. In the absence of Zn(2+), we find evidence for two primary OT conformations, which arise because the Cys(6)-Pro(7) peptide bond exists in both the trans- and cis-configurations. Upon addition of Zn(2+), we determine binding constants in water of KA = 1.43 ± 0.24 and 0.42 ± 0.12 μM(-1), for the trans- and cis-configured populations, respectively. The Zn(2+) bound form of OT, having a cross section of Ω = 235 Å(2), has Pro(7) in the trans-configuration, which agrees with a prior report [Wyttenbach, T., Liu, D., Bowers, M. T.: Interactions of the hormone oxytocin with divalent metal ions. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 130, 5993-6000 (2008)], in which it was proposed that Zn(2+) binds to the peptide ring and is further coordinated by interaction of the C-terminal, Pro(7)-Leu(8)-Gly(9)-NH2, tail. The present work shows that the cis-configuration of OT isomerizes to the trans-configuration upon binding Zn(2+). In this way, the proline residue regulates Zn(2+) binding to OT and, hence, is important in receptor binding.

After 6, 12, 24, 48 and 120 hr aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), glutamine (Gln), histidine (His), glycine (Gly), threonine (Thr), citrulline (Cit), arginine (Arg), alanine (Ala), taurine (Tau), γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), tyrosine (), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), l-cystathionine (l-Cystat), valine (Val), methionine (Met), tryptophane (Trp), phenylalanine (Phe), isoleucine (), leucine (Leu), ornithine (Orn), lysine (Lys), plus N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were determined in whole brain extracts (n = 6 rats at each time for both TBI levels). Sham-operated animals (n = 6) were used as controls. Results demonstrated that mTBI caused modest, transient changes in NAA, Asp, GABA, Gly, Arg. Following sTBI, animals showed profound, long-lasting modifications of Glu, Gln, NAA, Asp, GABA, Ser, Gly, Ala, Arg, Citr, Tau, Met, SAH, l-Cystat,  and Phe. Increase in Glu and Gln, depletion of NAA and Asp increase, suggested a link between NAA hydrolysis and excitotoxicity after sTBI. Additionally, sTBI rats showed net imbalances of the Glu-Gln/GABA cycle between neurons and astrocytes, and of the methyl-cycle (demonstrated by decrease in Met, and increase in SAH and l-Cystat), throughout the post-injury period. Besides evidencing new potential targets for novel pharmacological treatments, these results suggest that the force acting on the brain tissue at the time of the impact is the main determinant of the reactions ignited and involving amino acid .© 2016 The Authors.

However, the criteria for identifying OST enzymes largely remain unresolved. In this study, we compared the amino acid composition of 19 OST esterases and 19 non-OST esterases. OST esterases have increased ratio of Ala and Arg residues and decreased ratio of Asn, , , and Ser residues. Based on the amino acid composition analysis, we cloned acarboxylesterase (EstSP2) from a psychrophilic bacterium,  PAMC 26605, and characterized its recombinant protein. EstSP2 is substrate specific to -nitrophenyl acetate and hydrolyzed aspirin, with optimal activityat 40°C; at 4°C, the activity is approximately 50% of its maximum. As expected, EstSP2showstolerance in up to 40% concentration of polar organic solvents, including dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol, and ethanol.

The orientation of the fatty acids in the active sites of DOX was investigated with amino acid conjugates of 18:3n-3 and 18:2n-6. 9S-DOX-allene oxide synthase (AOS) oxidized the Gly, , and Trp derivatives at C-9, which suggests that these conjugates enter the substrate recognition site with the omega end in analogy with fatty acids bound to cyclooxygenases and coral 8R-lipoxygenase (8R-LOX). In contrast, 7,8-diol synthases (7,8-LDS), 5,8-LDS, and 8R-DOX-AOS oxidized the Gly conjugates in most case only to small amounts of metabolites, but with retention of hydrogen abstraction at C-8 and relatively minor hydrogen abstraction at C-11. The  and Trp conjugates were not oxidized at C-8, and often insignificantly at C-9/C-13. The 8-DOX domains of these enzymes likely position the carboxyl group of substrates at the end of the active site in analogy with plant α-DOX and 9-LOX.  radicals of the 9S-DOX and 8R-DOX domains catalyze antarafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion in 18:3n-3.

In vitro, the hybrids behaved as agonists at the opioid receptors and antagonists at the nociceptin receptor. Intravenous administration of hybrid 13a (H-Dmt-d-Arg-Aba-β-Ala-Arg---Arg--Lys-NH2) to mice resulted in potent and long lasting antinociception in the tail-flick test, indicating that 13a was able to permeate the BBB. This was further supported by a cell-based BBB model. All hybrids alleviated allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models. Especially with respect to hyperalgesia, they showed to be more effective than the parent compounds. Hybrid 13a did not result in significant respiratory depression, in contrast to an equipotent analgesic dose of morphine. These hybrids hence represent a promising avenue toward analgesics for the dual treatment of acute and neuropathic pain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29061520>Understanding the adhesion mechanism of a mucin binding domain from Lactobacillus fermentum and its role in enteropathogen exclusion.</a></h2><p>Lactobacillus species possesses surface exposed Mucin Binding Protein (MucBP) which plays a role in adhesion to gastrointestinal mucin. MucBP contains one or more mucin binding domain (MBD), the functionality of which has yet not been characterized thoroughly. Here, we have characterized a 93-amino acid MBD (MBD) of MucBP (LAF_0673) from Lactobacillus fermentum. Multiple sequence alignment of L. fermentum MBD exhibited ∼60% sequence homology with MBDs from other Lactobacillus species. Further, we cloned, expressed and purified MBD from Escherichia coli as N-terminal histidine-tagged protein (6X His-MBD). The purified MBD was able to bind to mucin and showed strong affinity towards the terminally expressed mucin glycans viz. N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), Galactose (Gal), and Sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5Ac). In silico experiments further confirmed the interaction between homology modeled MBD to mucin glycans through hydrogen-bonding with its surface amino acid residues Ser, Pro, ,  and Ala. We also have demonstrated that MBD was able to inhibit the adhesion of enteric pathogens, including E. coli, Salmonella Paratyphi A, Shigella sonnei and Proteus vulgaris to mucin. Our results suggested that L. fermentum MBD is a functionally sufficient unit to act as an adhesin and to protect from invading enteric pathogens.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The gene encoding the FGLa/AST polypeptide precursor was first isolated from cockroaches and since then could be identified in many insects and crustaceans. With its strictly conserved regions in combination with variable regions the gene seems to be a good candidate for phylogenetic analyses between closely and distantly related species. Here, the structure of the FGLa/AST gene of the most primitive termite, the giant northern termite Mastotermes darwiniensis Froggatt, was identified. The FGLa/AST gene of the woodroach Cryptocercus darwini was also determined. Precursor sequences of both species possess the general organization of dictyopteran FGLa/AST precursors containing 14 putative FGLa/AST peptides. In M. darwiniensis, only 11 out of the 14 FGLa/AST-like peptides possess the C-terminal conserved region Y/FXFGL/I/V/M and four of the putative peptide structures are not followed by a Gly residue that would lead to nonamidated peptides. Phylogenetic analyses show the high degree of similarity of dictyopteran FGLa/AST sequences. The position of termites, nested within the Blattaria, confirms that termites have evolved from primitive cockroaches.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25691211>Improved radiosynthesis and preliminary in vivo evaluation of a (18)F-labeled glycopeptide-peptoid hybrid for PET imaging of neurotensin receptor 2.</a></h2><p>The neurotensin receptor 2 (NTS2) is an attractive target for cancer imaging, as it is overexpressed in a variety of tumor types including prostate, pancreas and breast carcinoma. The aim of this study was the development of the first NTS2 subtype selective (18)F-labeled radioligand for imaging NTS2 expression in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). The radiosynthesis of glycopeptoid (18)F-4 was realized by copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), applying the prosthetic group 6-deoxy-6-[(18)F]fluoroglucosyl azide for (18)F-fluoroglycosylation of the alkyne-terminated NT(8-13) analog Pra-N-Me-Arg-Arg-Pro-N-homo---Leu-OH. The binding affinity of the peptide-peptoid 4 for NTS2 was 7nM with excellent subtype selectivity over NTS1 (260-fold). In vitro autoradiography studies of rat brain slices confirmed the high selectivity of (18)F-4 for NTS2. Biodistribution experiments using HT29 and PC3 tumor-bearing nude mice revealed high renal and only moderate tumor uptake, while PET imaging experiments revealed specific binding of (18)F-4 in NTS2-positive tumors. As (18)F-4 displayed high stability in vitro but fast degradation in vivo, future work will focus on the development of metabolically more stable NT(8-13) analogs.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed a method to determine deoccluded bound Ca(2+) by taking advantage of its rapid occlusion upon formation of E1PCa2 and of stabilization afforded by a high concentration of Ca(2+). The assay is applicable to minute amounts of Ca(2+)-ATPase expressed in COS-1 cells. It was validated by measuring the Ca(2+) binding properties of unphosphorylated Ca(2+)-ATPase. The method was then applied to the isomerization of the phosphorylated intermediate associated with the Ca(2+) release process E1PCa2 → E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca(2+). In the wild type, Ca(2+) release occurs concomitantly with EP isomerization fitting with rate-limiting isomerization (E1PCa2 → E2PCa2) followed by very rapid Ca(2+) release. In contrast, with alanine mutants of Leu(119) and (122) on the cytoplasmic part of the second transmembrane helix (M2) and (179) on the A domain, Ca(2+) release in 10 μm Ca(2+) lags EP isomerization, indicating the presence of a transient E2P state with bound Ca(2+). The results suggest that these residues function in Ca(2+) affinity reduction in E2P, likely via a structural rearrangement at the cytoplasmic part of M2 and a resulting association with the A and P domains, therefore leading to Ca(2+) release.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29210629>Development of a Substrate Identification Method for Human Scp1 Phosphatase Using Phosphorylation Mimic Phage Display.</a></h2><p>Protein phosphorylation is strictly regulated by protein kinases and protein phosphatases, and disordered regulation of protein phosphorylation often causes serious diseases, such as cancer. Protein phosphatases are divided into two major groups: tyrosine () phosphatases and serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) phosphatases. Substrate trapping mutants are frequently used to characterize  phosphatases and identify their substrates; however, a rapid and simple method to identify substrates for Ser/Thr phosphatases has yet to be developed. Recently it has reported that AlF4 -/AlF3 and BeF3 - form a complex with Mg2+ in the catalytic center of FCP/SCP phosphatases, and that the Mg2+-AlF4 -/AlF3 complex mimics the transition state of the hydrolysis step, while the Mg2+-BeF3 - complex mimics the aspartylphosphate intermediate.The main objective of this study was to develop a novel methodology, termed Phosphorylation Mimic Phage Display (PMPD), to identify substrates for Ser/Thr phosphatase Scp1 using peptide phage display libraries with Mg2+ and AlF4 -.Recombinant protein of human full-length Scp1 (rScp1) expressed in E. coli system was purified by Co2+ chelated affinity column, and then confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot analysis. The Ph.D.-C7C or M12 Phage Display Libraries (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) were screened using purified rScp1 immobilized on ELISA plate. Then, the plate was blocked with 0.5% (w/v) BSA in maleate buffer at 4°C for 3 h, before adding approximately 1×1010 plaque-forming units (pfu) of the phages in maleate blocking AlF4 - buffer to each well. After incubating, the wells were washed with maleate AlF4 - buffer to remove unbound phages. Then, phages were eluted with Mg2+ and AlF4 - free maleate buffer or with excess rScp1. After the third round of screening, the isolated phages were sequenced and subjected to binding analyses.After panning by PMPD method, 46 and 60 clones were isolated from the Ph.D. C7C and Ph.D. 12 phage libraries, respectively, as Mg2+ or/and AlF4 - -dependent binding clones. The binding analyses showed that M12-1 and Dep-3 specifically bind to Scp1 in an AlF4 --dependent manner. Notably, the Dep-3 peptide contained a Thr-Pro-Met-Ser sequence, which is similar to the Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5 (Ser/Thr-Pro-partially hydrophobic residue-Ser) sequence found in CTD, which is an endogenous substrate for Scp1. Binding analyses also showed that both BP-14 and M12-6a bound to Scp1 in a Mg2+-dependent manner. BP-14 peptide contained Ser- Thr- and Pro-Phe-Glu sequences, which are similar to the Ser-Thr-Trp and -Phe-Glu sequences found in M12-6a, suggesting that one or both of these tripeptides may be the binding motif(s) recognized by Scp1.We developed a substrate identification method for the Ser/Thr phosphatase Scp1 using a novel phage display method with AlF4 -. Dep-3 showed a core sequence similar to that of the CTD of RNA polymerase II, an endogenous Scp1 substrate, suggesting that this method is applicable for identifying novel Scp1 substrate candidates. This method will also be applicable for other FCP/SCP-type phosphatases, allowing us to better understand the substrate recognition mechanisms of Ser/Thr phosphatases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586060>Designer Self-Assemble Peptides Maximize the Therapeutic Benefits of Neural Stem Cell Transplantation for Alzheimer's Disease via Enhancing Neuron Differentiation and Paracrine Action.</a></h2><p>The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include the presence of extracellular amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in the form of amyloid plaques and neuronal loss. Neural stem cell (NSC) is being scrutinized as a promising cell replacement therapy for various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the unfavorable niche at the site of degenerative disease is hostile to the survival and differentiation of transplanted cells. Here, we undertook in vitro and in vivo works to examine whether a designer self-assemble peptide (DSP), which contains one functional domain --Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR) derived from laminin, promotes the survival and neuronal differentiation of NSC and behavioral improvement. We found that DSP could undergo spontaneous assembly into well-ordered nanofibers, and it not only facilitated the cell viability in normal culture condition, but also decreased the number of apoptotic cells induced by Aβ in vitro. NSC seeded in DSP showed much more neuronal differentiation than that seeded in self-assemble peptide (SP) or alone. In the AD model, NSC transplantation in DSP-treated AD rats demonstrated much more obvious cognitive rescue with restoration of learning/memory function compared with NSC transplantation in SP, NSC alone, or DSP alone treated ones. Interestingly, DSP enhanced the survival and neuronal differentiation of transplanted NSC. Apoptosis levels in the CA1 region and Aβ level in the hippocampus were significantly decreased in the group of NSC transplantation in DSP. Moreover, synaptic function, indicated by the expression of pre-synaptic protein synapsin-1, was restored and the secretion of anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic factors were increased, such as IL-10, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), while the expression of pro-inflammatory factors were decreased, such as TNF-α and IL-1β. These data firstly unveiled that the biomaterial DSP can maximize the therapeutic benefits of NSC transplantation for AD through improving the survival and differentiation of transplanted stem cells and promoting the effects of neuroprotection, anti-neuroinflammatory and paracrine action. Our results may have important clinical implications for the design of future NSC-based strategies using the biomaterials for various neurodegenerative diseases including AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27532814>Small-Molecule-Directed Hepatocyte-Like Cell Differentiation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.</a></h2><p>Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) generated in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide an invaluable resource for basic research, regenerative medicine, drug screening, toxicology, and modeling of liver disease and development. This unit describes a small-molecule-driven protocol for in vitro differentiation of hPSCs into HLCs without the use of growth factors. hPSCs are coaxed through a developmentally relevant route via the primitive streak to definitive endoderm (DE) using the small molecule CHIR99021 (a Wnt agonist), replacing the conventional growth factors Wnt3A and activin A. The small-molecule-derived DE is then differentiated to hepatoblast-like cells in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide. The resulting hepatoblasts are then differentiated to HLCs with N-hexanoic-, -6 aminohexanoic amide (Dihexa, a hepatocyte growth factor agonist) and dexamethasone. The protocol provides an efficient and reproducible procedure for differentiation of hPSCs into HLCs utilizing small molecules.© 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27061063>Serum Tyrosine-to-Phenylalanine Ratio is Low in Parkinson's Disease.</a></h2><p>Noninvasive biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD) are currently unavailable.To search for a biomarker unique to PD in sweat and serum.Sweat samples in 42 PD patients and 16 controls were analyzed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS).

While cholesterol-sensing motifs in transmembrane proteins have been identified, little is known about cholesterol recognition by soluble proteins. We reviewed the structural characteristics of binding sites for cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate from crystallographic structures available in the Protein Data Bank. This analysis unveiled key features of cholesterol-binding sites that are present in either all or the majority of sites: ) the cholesterol molecule is generally positioned between protein domains that have an organized secondary structure; ) the cholesterol hydroxyl/sulfo group is often partnered by Asn, Gln, and/or , while the hydrophobic part of cholesterol interacts with Leu, , Val, and/or Phe; ) cholesterol hydrogen-bonding partners are often found on α-helices, while amino acids that interact with cholesterol's hydrophobic core have a slight preference for β-strands and secondary structure-lacking protein areas; ) the steroid's C21 and C26 constitute the "hot spots" most often seen for steroid-protein hydrophobic interactions; ) common "cold spots" are C8-C10, C13, and C17, at which contacts with the proteins were not detected.

Manganese exposure is considered to be an environmental risk factor connected to PD and PD-like syndrome. Research into the genetic and environmental risk factors involved in disease susceptibility has recently uncovered a link existing between Park9 and manganese. It seems that manganese binding to Park9 (YPk9) protein is involved in the detoxification mechanism exerted by this protein against manganese toxicity. In this study, we used potentiometric, mono- and bi-dimensional (TOCSY, HSQC) NMR, EPR and ESI-MS measurements to analyze complex formation and metal binding sites in the peptide fragment. Presumably octahedral species, in which the Mn(II) ion was bound to oxygens of the carboxyl groups of Glu and Asp, and species where the involvement of sulfur from Cys and nitrogen from His residues, depending on the metal to ligand molar ratio, were detected for manganese coordination. Structural changes in the 30-amino acid fragment were triggered by Zn(II) interaction. A general decrease in the intensity of NMR signals was detected, suggesting the occurrence of chemical exchange among some coordinated species in an intermediate NMR timescale. The coordination may involve both S and N donor atoms from cysteine as well as histidine residues, together with O donor atoms from glutamic and aspartic residues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281794>β-casomorphin-7 alters μ-opioid receptor and dipeptidyl peptidase IV genes expression in children with atopic dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with heterogeneous clinical phenotypes reflecting genetic predisposition and exposure to environmental factors. Reactions to food may play a significant role especially in young children. Milk proteins are particularly strong allergens and are additional source of bioactive peptides including β-casomorphin-7 (BCM7, -Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-). BCM7 exerts its influence on nervous, digestive, and immune functions via the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). Proline dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV; EC 3.4.14.5) appears to be the primary degrading enzyme of BCM7. Moreover, DPPIV is known to restrict activity of proinflammatory peptides. BCM7 is considered to modulate an immune response by affecting MOR and DPPIV genes expression. In this study, we determined the MOR and DPPIV genes expression in children diagnosed with a severe form of AD. 40 healthy children and 62 children diagnosed with severe AD (AD score ≥60) were included in the study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the studied subjects were incubated with the peptide extracts of raw and hydrolysed cow milk with defined β-casein genotypes (A1A1, A2A2 and A1A2) and MOR and DPPIV genes expression was determined with real-time PCR. Incubation PBMCs with peptide extracts from cow milk caused an increase of the MOR gene expression (p<0.05; p<0.001) in AD children with a simultaneous decrease in the DPPIV gene expression (p<0.001). The obtained results supplement the knowledge on the BCM7 participation in AD etiology and provide an important diagnostic tool.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Following natural infection, 10-70% of the infected stallions can become persistently infected and continue to shed EAV in their semen for periods ranging from several months to life. Recently, we reported that some stallions possess a subpopulation(s) of CD3+ T lymphocytes that are susceptible to in vitro EAV infection and that this phenotypic trait is associated with long-term carrier status following exposure to the virus. In contrast, stallions not possessing the CD3+ T lymphocyte susceptible phenotype are at less risk of becoming long-term virus carriers. A genome wide association study (GWAS) using the Illumina Equine SNP50 chip revealed that the ability of EAV to infect CD3+ T lymphocytes and establish long-term carrier status in stallions correlated with a region within equine chromosome 11. Here we identified the gene and mutations responsible for these phenotypes. Specifically, the work implicated three allelic variants of the equine orthologue of CXCL16 (EqCXCL16) that differ by four non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions (XM_00154756; c.715 A → T, c.801 G → C, c.804 T → A/G, c.810 G → A) within exon 1. This resulted in four amino acid changes with EqCXCL16S (XP_001504806.1) having Phe, His,  and Lys as compared to EqCXL16R having , Asp, Phe, and Glu at 40, 49, 50, and 52, respectively. Two alleles (EqCXCL16Sa, EqCXCL16Sb) encoded identical protein products that correlated strongly with long-term EAV persistence in stallions (P<0.000001) and are required for in vitro CD3+ T lymphocyte susceptibility to EAV infection. The third (EqCXCL16R) was associated with in vitro CD3+ T lymphocyte resistance to EAV infection and a significantly lower probability for establishment of the long-term carrier state (viral persistence) in the male reproductive tract. EqCXCL16Sa and EqCXCL16Sb exert a dominant mode of inheritance. Most importantly, the protein isoform EqCXCL16S but not EqCXCL16R can function as an EAV cellular receptor. Although both molecules have equal chemoattractant potential, EqCXCL16S has significantly higher scavenger receptor and adhesion properties compared to EqCXCL16R.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25430058>Structure refinement and membrane positioning of selectively labeled OmpX in phospholipid nanodiscs.</a></h2><p>NMR structural studies on membrane proteins are often complicated by their large size, taking into account the contribution of the membrane mimetic. Therefore, classical resonance assignment approaches often fail. The large size of phospholipid nanodiscs, a detergent-free phospholipid bilayer mimetic, prevented their use in high-resolution solution-state NMR spectroscopy so far. We recently introduced smaller nanodiscs that are suitable for NMR structure determination. However, side-chain assignments of a membrane protein in nanodiscs still remain elusive. Here, we utilized a NOE-based approach to assign (stereo-) specifically labeled , Leu, Val and Ala methyl labeled and uniformly (15)N-Phe and (15)N- labeled OmpX and calculated a refined high-resolution structure. In addition, we were able to obtain residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) of OmpX in nanodiscs using Pf1 phage medium for the induction of weak alignment. Back-calculated NOESY spectra of the obtained NMR structures were compared to experimental NOESYs in order to validate the quality of these structures. We further used NOE information between protonated lipid head groups and side-chain methyls to determine the position of OmpX in the phospholipid bilayer. These data were verified by paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments obtained with Gd(3+)-modified lipids. Taken together, this study emphasizes the need for the (stereo-) specific labeling of membrane proteins in a highly deuterated background for high-resolution structure determination, particularly in large membrane mimicking systems like phospholipid nanodiscs. Structure validation by NOESY back-calculation will be helpful for the structure determination and validation of membrane proteins where NOE assignment is often difficult. The use of protein to lipid NOEs will be beneficial for the positioning of a membrane protein in the lipid bilayer without the need for preparing multiple protein samples.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27440890>The Interaction between Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Tegument Proteins UL51 and UL14 and Its Role in Virion Morphogenesis.</a></h2><p>To investigate the molecular mechanism(s) by which herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) tegument protein UL51 promotes viral replication, we screened for viral proteins that interact with UL51 in infected cells. Affinity purification of tagged UL51 in HSV-1-infected Vero cells was coupled with immunoblotting of the purified UL51 complexes with various antibodies to HSV-1 virion proteins. Subsequent analyses revealed that UL51 interacted with another tegument protein, UL14, in infected cells. Mutational analyses of UL51 showed that UL51 amino acid residues Leu-111, -119, and -123 were required for interaction with UL14 in HSV-1-infected cells. Alanine substitutions of these UL51 amino acid residues reduced viral replication and produced an accumulation of unenveloped and partially enveloped nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm at levels comparable to those of UL51-null, UL14-null, and UL51/UL14 double-null mutations. In addition, although UL51 and UL14 colocalized at juxtanuclear domains in HSV-1-infected cells, the amino acid substitutions in UL51 produced aberrant localization of UL51 and UL14. The effects of these substitutions on localization of UL51 and UL14 were similar to those of the UL51-null and UL14-null mutations on localization of UL14 and UL51, respectively. These results suggested that the interaction between UL51 and UL14 was required for proper localization of these viral proteins in infected cells and that the UL51-UL14 complex regulated final viral envelopment for efficient viral replication.Herpesviruses contain a unique virion structure designated the tegument, which is a protein layer between the nucleocapsid and the envelope. HSV-1 has dozens of viral proteins in the tegument, which are thought to facilitate viral envelopment by interacting with other virion components. However, although numerous interactions among virion proteins have been reported, data on how these interactions facilitate viral envelopment is limited. In this study, we have presented data showing that the interaction of HSV-1 tegument proteins UL51 and UL14 promoted viral final envelopment for efficient viral replication. In particular, prevention of this interaction induced aberrant accumulation of partially enveloped capsids in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the UL51-UL14 complex acted in the envelopment process but not in an upstream event, such as transport of capsids to the site for envelopment. This is the first report showing that an interaction between HSV-1 tegument proteins directly regulated final virion envelopment.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

These PLP-dependent enzymes show high sequence homology (∼40% identity) and both form homotetrameric structures. Steady state kinetic studies with both enzymes show that an active site base is essential for activity, and α-deuterated substrates exhibit modest primary isotope effects on kcat and kcat/Km, suggesting that substrate deprotonation is partially rate-limiting. Pre-steady state kinetics with TPL and TIL show rapid formation of external aldimine intermediates, followed by deprotonation to give quinonoid intermediates absorbing at about 500nm. In the presence of phenol and indole analogues, 4-hydroxypyridine and benzimidazole, the quinonoid intermediates of TPL and TIL decay to aminoacrylate intermediates, with λmax at about 340nm. Surprisingly, there are significant kinetic isotope effects on both formation and subsequent decay of the quinonoid intermediates when α-deuterated substrates are used. The crystal structure of TPL with a bound competitive inhibitor, 4-hydroxyphenylpropionate, identified several essential catalytic residues: -71, Thr-124, Arg-381, and Phe-448. The active sites of TIL and TPL are highly conserved with the exceptions of these residues: Arg-381(TPL)/-396 (TIL); Thr-124 (TPL)/Asp-137 (TIL), and Phe-448 (TPL)/His-463 (TIL). Mutagenesis of these residues results in dramatic decreases in catalytic activity without changing substrate specificity. The conserved tyrosine, -71 (TPL)/-74 (TIL) is essential for elimination activity with both enzymes, and likely plays a role as a proton donor to the leaving group. Mutation of Arg-381 and Thr-124 of TPL to alanine results in very low but measurable catalytic activity. Crystallography of Y71F and F448H TPL with 3-fluoro-l-tyrosine bound demonstrated that there are two quinonoid structures, relaxed and tense. In the relaxed structure, the substrate aromatic ring is in plane with the Cβ-Cγ bond, but in the tense structure, the substrate aromatic ring is about 20° out of plane with the Cβ-Cγ bond. In the tense structure, hydrogen bonds are formed between the substrate OH and the guanidinium of Arg-381 and the OH of Thr-124, and the phenyl rings of Phe-448 and 449 provide steric strain. Based on the effects of mutagenesis, the substrate strain is estimated to contribute about 10(8) to TPL catalysis. Thus, the mechanisms of TPL and TIL require both substrate strain and acid/base catalysis, and substrate strain is probably responsible for the very high substrate specificity of TPL and TIL.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The inhibitory activity was stable over a wide range of pH and was fully retained after 30 min at 80°C, after which it decreased gradually at higher temperatures. The activity was sensitive to the proteolytic action of α-chymotrypsin, proteinase-K, and trypsin, indicating its proteinaceous nature. This bacteriocin was active against a broad spectrum of bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans. Direct detection of antimicrobial activity on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel suggested an apparent molecular mass of approximately 5 kDa. Ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography integrated with reverse phase-high-performance liquid chromatography were used for bacteriocin purification. Automated N-terminal Edman degradation of the purified RX7 bacteriocin recognized the first 15 amino acids as NH2-X-Ala-Trp--Asp--Arg-Lys-Leu-Gly-Asn-Lys-Gly-Ala, where the letter X in the sequence indicates an unknown or nonstandard amino acid. Based on BLAST similarity search and multiple alignment analysis, the obtained partial sequence showed high homology with the two-peptide lantibiotic haloduracin (HalA1) from Bacillus halodurans, although at least two amino acids differed between the sequences. A time-kill study demonstrated a bactericidal mode of action of RX7 bacteriocin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27143767>Influence of dietary amino acid reductions and Eimeria acervulina infection on growth performance and intestinal cytokine responses of broilers fed low crude protein diets.</a></h2><p>Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of Eimeria acervulina infection on growth performance, plasma carotenoids, and intestinal cytokine responses of broilers fed low crude protein (LCP) diets with reduced concentrations of selected amino acids (AA). Experiment 1 was conducted to validate a dietary formulation approach in which broilers were fed 1 of 5 diets including a 19.0% CP corn-soybean meal based (CSBM) diet, a LCP control diet (16.7% CP) that matched the AA profile of the CSBM diet, and 3 LCP diets with 30% reductions in standardized ileal digestible concentrations of TSAA, Lys, or Thr from 14 to 23 d post-hatch. Body weight gain and G:F were greatest (P < 0.05) and similar for broilers fed the CSBM and LCP control diets, whereas reductions in Thr, TSAA, and Lys each decreased (P < 0.05) G:F of broilers. In Experiment 2, birds were allotted to 18 treatment groups in a factorial arrangement of 9 dietary treatments × 2 infection states. Dietary treatments included a LCP control diet similar to that fed in Experiment 1 and 8 LCP diets with 40% individual reductions in TSAA, Lys, Thr, Val, , Arg, Phe + , or Gly + Ser. Broilers received experimental diets from 10 d to 28 d post-hatch and were inoculated with 0 or 4.0 × 10 sporulated E. acervulina oocysts at 15 d. Decreased (P < 0.05) growth performance (10 to 28 d) of broilers was observed with each AA reduction, except Phe + , compared with birds fed the LCP control diet. Body weight gain and G:F were lowest (P < 0.05) for birds fed diets reduced in Lys or Val. Eimeria acervulina decreased growth performance and plasma carotenoids of broilers, but effects varied among dietary treatment groups as indicated by diet × infection interactions (P < 0.05).

Following delivery into gastric epithelial cells by type IV secretion and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation at the EPIYA motifs, CagA serves as an oncogenic scaffold/adaptor that promiscuously interacts with SH2 domain-containing mammalian proteins such as the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) and the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), a negative regulator of Src family kinases. Like CagA, Pragmin also forms a physical complex with Csk. In the present study, we found that Pragmin directly binds to Csk by the tyrosine-phosphorylated EPIYA motif. The complex formation potentiates kinase activity of Csk, which in turn phosphorylates Pragmin on tyrosine-238 (Y238), Y343, and Y391. As Y391 of Pragmin comprises the EPIYA motif, Pragmin-Csk interaction creates a feed-forward regulatory loop of Csk activation. Together with the finding that Pragmin and Csk are colocalized to focal adhesions, these observations indicate that the Pragmin-Csk interaction, triggered by Pragmin EPIYA phosphorylation, robustly stimulates the kinase activity of Csk at focal adhesions, which direct cell-matrix adhesion that regulates cell morphology and cell motility. As a consequence, expression of Pragmin and/or Csk in epithelial cells induces an elongated cell shape with elevated cell scattering in a manner that is mutually dependent on Pragmin and Csk. Deregulation of the Pragmin-Csk axis may therefore induce aberrant cell migration that contributes to tumor invasion and metastasis.© 2016 The Authors.

Here we describe their binding site using computational modeling, binding, and functional studies on WT and mutated CCR5. The metal ion Zn is anchored to the chemokine receptor-conserved Glu-283 Both chelators interact with aromatic residues in the transmembrane receptor domain. The additional pyridine ring of ZnTerp binds deeply in the major binding pocket and, in contrast to ZnBip, interacts directly with the Trp-248 microswitch, contributing to its 8-fold higher potency. The impact of Trp-248 was further confirmed by ZnClTerp, a chloro-substituted version of ZnTerp that showed no inherent agonism but maintained positive allosteric modulation of CCL3 binding. Despite a similar overall binding mode of all three metal ion chelator complexes, the pyridine ring of ZnClTerp blocks the conformational switch of Trp-248 required for receptor activation, thereby explaining its lack of activity. Importantly, ZnClTerp becomes agonist to the same extent as ZnTerp upon Ala mutation of -116, a residue that constrains the Trp-248 microswitch in its inactive conformation. Binding studies with I-CCL3 revealed an allosteric interface between the chemokine and the small molecule binding site, including residues -37, Trp-86, and Phe-109 The small molecules and CCL3 approach this interface from opposite directions, with some residues being mutually exploited. This study provides new insight into the molecular mechanism of CCR5 activation and paves the way for future allosteric drugs for chemokine receptors.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234771>Properties of Rhodobacter sphaeroides Reaction Centers with the → Substitution at Positions L177 and M206.</a></h2><p>Studying pigment-protein interactions in the photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) is important for the understanding of detailed mechanisms of the photochemical process. This paper describes spectral and photochemical characteristics, pigment composition, and stability of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides RCs with the I(L177)Y and I(M206)Y amino acid substitutions. The obtained data are compared with the properties of I(L177)H, I(L177)D, and I(M206)H RCs reported previously. It is shown that the I(L177)Y and I(M206)Y mutations cause a similar shift of the QP band in the absorption spectra of the mutant RCs and do not affect the distribution of the electron spin density within the photo-oxidized P dimer. The differences in the position and amplitude of the QB band in the I(L177)Y and I(M206)Y RCs were determined.

Factor IXa (activated Factor IX) serves as the trigger for amplification of coagulation through formation of the so-called Xase complex, which is a ternary complex of Factor IXa, its substrate Factor X and the cofactor Factor VIIIa on the surface of activated platelets. Within the Xase complex the substrate turnover by Factor IXa is enhanced 200000-fold; however, the mechanistic and structural basis for this dramatic enhancement remains only partly understood. A multifaceted approach using enzymatic, biophysical and crystallographic methods to evaluate a key set of activity-enhanced Factor IXa variants has demonstrated a delicately balanced bidirectional network. Essential molecular interactions across multiple regions of the Factor IXa molecule co-operate in the maturation of the active site. This maturation is specifically facilitated by long-range communication through the (212)-(213) motif unique to Factor IXa and a flexibility of the 170-loop that is further dependent on the conformation in the Cys(168)-Cys(182) disulfide bond. Ultimately, the network consists of compensatory brakes (Val(16) and (213)) and accelerators ((99) and Phe(174)) that together allow for a subtle fine-tuning of enzymatic activity.© 2016 The Author(s). published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803828>PTK2B/Pyk2 overexpression improves a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>Pyk2 is a Ca-activated non-receptor tyrosine kinase enriched in forebrain neurons and involved in synaptic regulation. Human genetic studies associated PTK2B, the gene coding Pyk2, with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously showed that Pyk2 is important for hippocampal function, plasticity, and spine structure. However, its potential role in AD is unknown. To address this question we used human brain samples and 5XFAD mice, an amyloid mouse model of AD expressing mutated human amyloid precursor protein and presenilin1. In the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice and in human AD patients' cortex and hippocampus, Pyk2 total levels were normal. However, Pyk2 -402 phosphorylation levels, reflecting its autophosphorylation-dependent activity, were reduced in 5XFAD mice at 8 months of age but not 3 months. We crossed these mice with Pyk2 mice to generate 5XFAD animals devoid of Pyk2. At 8 months the phenotype of 5XFAD x Pyk2 double mutant mice was not different from that of 5XFAD. In contrast, overexpression of Pyk2 in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice, using adeno-associated virus, rescued autophosphorylated Pyk2 levels and improved synaptic markers and performance in several behavioral tasks. Both Pyk2 and 5XFAD mice showed an increase of potentially neurotoxic Src cleavage product, which was rescued by Pyk2 overexpression. Manipulating Pyk2 levels had only minor effects on Aβ plaques, which were slightly decreased in hippocampus CA3 region of double mutant mice and increased following overexpression. Our results show that Pyk2 is not essential for the pathogenic effects of human amyloidogenic mutations in the 5XFAD mouse model. However, the slight decrease in plaque number observed in these mice in the absence of Pyk2 and their increase following Pyk2 overexpression suggest a contribution of this kinase in plaque formation. Importantly, a decreased function of Pyk2 was observed in 5XFAD mice, indicated by its decreased autophosphorylation and associated Src alterations. Overcoming this deficit by Pyk2 overexpression improved the behavioral and molecular phenotype of 5XFAD mice. Thus, our results in a mouse model of AD suggest that Pyk2 impairment may play a role in the symptoms of the disease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Evidence accumulates that H. pylori cagA-positive strains play a crucial role in the neoplastic transformation of mammalian cells. The cagA-encoded CagA protein is delivered into the host cells via bacterial type IV secretion, where it interacts with and thereby aberrantly activates pro-oncogenic phosphatase SHP2. The CagA-SHP2 interaction requires tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA at the Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA) motif. The incidences of gastric cancer in East Asian countries such as Japan, China, and Korea are among the highest worldwide. A vast majority of H. pylori circulating in East Asia produce a CagA variant termed East Asian CagA, which possesses the SHP2-binding EPIYA motif (EPIYA-D) that is substantially diverged in sequence from the SHP2-binding EPIYA motif (EPIYA-C) of CagA isolated in the rest of the world (Western CagA). Tyrosine-phosphorylated EPIYA-D interacts with SHP2 approximately two orders of magnitude stronger than tyrosine-phosphorylated EPIYA-C does. The strong SHP2 binding of East Asian CagA is achieved by a cryptic interaction between the phenylalanine residue located at the +5 position from the phospho-tyrosine in EPIYA-D and a small hollow on the N-SH2 phosphopeptide-binding floor, the latter of which cannot be created by the corresponding aspartic acid in EPIYA-C. Thus, a variation in a single amino-acid residue determines the magnitude for the pathogenic/oncogenic action of CagA, which may influence the worldwide landscape in the incidence of H. pylori-associated malignancies, especially gastric cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29682906>Profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus MN-ZLW-002 nutrient requirements in controlled pH batch fermentations.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus nutrient requirements to guide the design of media for high cell density culturing. The growth kinetics, physiological state, and nutrient requirement profiles of S. thermophilus were analyzed in chemically defined media. The results showed that the intracellular ATP concentration, H -ATPase activity, NADH/NAD , and NH concentrations varied with intracellular pH. The nutrient components with the highest amounts required were Leu and Asp; ascorbic acid and p-amino benzoic acid; K and PO  ; and guanine and uracil. The nutrient components with the largest required ratios were Arg, His, and Met; folic acid, cyanocobalamine, biotin, and nicotinic acid; Ca and Mg ; and guanine and uracil. In this study, different nutrient components were primarily used at different phase. Trp, , calcium pantothenate, thiamine, guanine, and Mg were mainly used from late-lag to midexponential phase. Met, Pro, Phe, Ala, Gly, nicotinic acid, and riboflavin were mainly used from midexponential to late-exponential phase. The highest bioavailabilities of nutrient components were also found at diverse phase. Met, Leu, , Asn, Glu, Lys, Pro, Gly, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, adenine, uracil, inosine, and Ca had the highest bioavailability from late-lag to midexponential phase. Lactose, Glu, Asp, His, Trp, Cys, Val, Arg, Phe, Ala, Ser, Thr, , folate and cobalamin, calcium pantothenate, ascorbic acid, thiamine, biotin, p-amino benzoic acid, vitamin B , K , Mg , guanine, xanthine, and PO  had the highest bioavailability from midexponential to late-exponential phase. This study elucidated the nutrient requirement profiles with culture time and biomass at various average growth rates during the growth of S. thermophilus.

The cagA gene-encoded CagA protein is delivered into gastric epithelial cells via bacterial type IV secretion, where it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at the Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA) motifs. Delivered CagA then acts as a non-physiological scaffold/hub protein by interacting with multiple host signaling molecules, most notably the pro-oncogenic phosphatase SHP2 and the polarity-regulating kinase PAR1/MARK, in both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manners. CagA-mediated manipulation of intracellular signaling promotes neoplastic transformation of gastric epithelial cells. Transgenic expression of CagA in experimental animals has confirmed the oncogenic potential of the bacterial protein. Structural polymorphism of CagA influences its scaffold function, which may underlie the geographic difference in the incidence of gastric cancer. Since CagA is no longer required for the maintenance of established gastric cancer cells, studying the role of CagA during neoplastic transformation will provide an excellent opportunity to understand molecular processes underlying "Hit-and-Run" carcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27537897>Anticancer Activity of a Hexapeptide from Skate (Raja porosa) Cartilage Protein Hydrolysate in HeLa Cells.</a></h2><p>In this study, the hexapeptide Phe--Met-Gly-Pro- (FIMGPY), which has a molecular weight of 726.9 Da, was separated from skate (Raja porosa) cartilage protein hydrolysate using ultrafiltration and chromatographic methods, and its anticancer activity was evaluated in HeLa cells. Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that FIMGPY exhibited high, dose-dependent anti-proliferation activities in HeLa cells with an IC50 of 4.81 mg/mL. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) fluorescence staining and flow cytometry methods confirmed that FIMGPY could inhibit HeLa cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Western blot assay revealed that the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and relative intensity of caspase-3 in HeLa cells treated with 7-mg/mL FIMGPY were 2.63 and 1.83, respectively, significantly higher than those of the blank control (p < 0.01). Thus, FIMGPY could induce apoptosis by upregulating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activation. Using a DNA ladder method further confirmed that the anti-proliferation activity of FIMGPY was attributable to its role in inducing apoptosis. These results suggest that FIMGPY from skate cartilage protein hydrolysate may have applications as functional foods and nutraceuticals for the treatment and prevention of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27697521>Activation of arginine vasopressin receptor 1a facilitates the induction of long-term potentiation in the accessory olfactory bulb of male mice.</a></h2><p>Olfaction plays an important role in social recognition in most mammals. Central arginine vasopressin (AVP) plays a role in this olfaction-based recognition. The high level of expression of AVP receptors in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) at the first relay of the vomeronasal system highlights the importance of AVP signaling at this stage. We therefore analyzed the effects of AVP on the synaptic plasticity of glutamatergic transmission from mitral cells to granule cells in AOB slices from male mice. To monitor the strength of the glutamatergic transmission, we measured the maximal initial slope of the lateral olfactory tract-evoked field potential, which represents the granule cell response to mitral cell activation. AVP paired with 100-Hz stimulation that only produced short-term potentiation enhanced the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in a dose-dependent manner. AVP-paired LTP was blocked by the selective AVP receptor 1a (AVPR1a) antagonist, d(CH)[(Me)]AVP (Manning compound), but not by the AVPR1b antagonist SSR149415, and it was mimicked by the selective AVPR1a agonist [Phe, , Orn]-vasopressin. We further examined the effect of AVP on the reciprocal transmission between mitral and granule cells by stimulating a mitral cell and recording the evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from the same cell using conventional whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. AVP reduced the reciprocal IPSCs triggered by endogenous glutamate release from the excited mitral cell. These results suggest that AVP promotes the induction of LTP at the mitral-to-granule cell synapse via the activation of AVPR1a through an as-yet-to-be-determined mechanism in the AOB of male mice.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the molecular details of ligand uptake and targeted release by CRBP1 remain unclear. Here we report the first structure of CRBP1 in a ligand-free form as well as ultra-high resolution structures of this protein bound to either all-trans-retinol or retinylamine, the latter a therapeutic retinoid that prevents light-induced retinal degeneration. Superpositioning of human apo- and holo-CRBP1 revealed major differences within segments surrounding the entrance to the retinoid-binding site. These included α-helix II and hairpin turns between β-strands βC-βD and βE-βF as well as several side chains, such as Phe-57, -60, and -77, that change their orientations to accommodate the ligand. Additionally, we mapped hydrogen bond  inside the retinoid-binding cavity and demonstrated their significance for the ligand affinity. Analyses of the crystallographic B-factors indicated several regions with higher backbone mobility in the apoprotein that became more rigid upon retinoid binding. This conformational flexibility of human apo-CRBP1 facilitates interaction with the ligands, whereas the more rigid holoprotein structure protects the labile retinoid moiety during vitamin A transport. These findings suggest a mechanism of induced fit upon ligand binding by mammalian cellular retinol-binding proteins.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27018713>Effects of Alpha-Ketoglutarate on Glutamine  in Piglet Enterocytes in Vivo and in Vitro.</a></h2><p>Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) plays a vital part in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is a key intermediate in the oxidation of L-glutamine (Gln). The study was to evaluate effects of AKG on Gln  in vivo and in vitro. A total of twenty-one piglets were weaned at 28 days with a mean body weight (BW) of 6.0 ± 0.2 kg, and randomly divided into 3 groups: corn soybean meal based diet (CON group); the basal diet with 1% alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG treatment group); and the basal diet with 1% L-glutamine (GLN treatment group). Intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) were incubated to investigate effects of 0.5, 2, and 3 mM AKG addition on Gln . Our results showed that there were no differences (P > 0.05) among the 3 treatments in initial BW, final BW, and average daily feed intake. However, average daily gain (P = 0.013) and gain:feed (P = 0.041) of the AKG group were greater than those of the other two groups. In comparison with the CON group, the AKG and GLN groups exhibited an improvement in villus length, mucosal thickness, and crypt depth in the jejunum of piglets. Serum concentrations of Asp, Glu, Val, , , Phe, Lys, and Arg in the piglets fed the 1% AKG or Gln diet were lower than those in the CON group. Compared with the CON group, the mRNA expression of jejunal and ileal amino acid (AA) transporters in the AKG and GLN groups were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Additionally, the in vitro study showed that the addition of 0.5, 2, and 3 mM AKG dose-dependently decreased (P < 0.05) the net utilization of Gln and formulation of ammonia, Glu, Ala, and Asp by IPEC-1. In conclusion, dietary AKG supplementation, as a replacement for Gln, could improve Gln  in piglet enterocytes and enhance the utilization of AA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28089664>Neurotensin NTS and NTS receptor agonists produce anxiolytic-like effects in the 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalization model in rats.</a></h2><p>Neurotensin is a neuropeptide neurotransmitter that interacts with multiple neurotransmitter systems, including those regulating amygdalar function, via NTS and NTS receptors. Both receptors are expressed in the amygdala and agonists for NTS or NTS receptors have exhibited anxiolytic effects in animal models. Systemic adminstration of NTS receptor agonist PD149163 was recently shown to reduce footshock conditioned 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations in rats, suggesting that PD149163 produced an anxiolytic effect. The effects that neurotensin may have or a selective NTS receptor agonist may have on 22-kHz vocalizations has yet to be examined. The current study evaluated the effects of intracerebroventricularly administered neurotensin (0.1-10.0μg), PD149163 (0.1-10.0ng), or the NTS receptor agonist JMV-431 (0.1-1.0μg) on footshock conditioned 22-kHz vocalizations in male Wistar rats. Neurotensin, PD149163, and JMV-431 all significantly reduced the number 22-kHz calls. No changes in call duration were found, suggesting that non-specific drug effects do not account for the reductions in 22-kHz calls. These data support anxiolytic effects produced by activation of NTS or NTS receptors, and suggest that neurotensin plays a natural role in the expression of conditioned USVs. These data suggest that both receptor subtypes are putative pharmacologic targets.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Numerous studies have reported the crucial role of caveolin-1 (CAV1) in response to invading microbes; yet, very little is known about molluscan CAV1. In this study, we identified and characterized CAV1 ortholog from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus (HdCAV1). The cDNA sequence of HdCAV1 is 826 bp long and encodes a 127-amino acid polypeptide. Characteristic caveolin superfamily domain (Glu - Lys) and two possible transmembrane domains (Cys -  and  - Phe) were identified in the HdCAV1 protein. Homology analysis revealed that HdCAV1 shared higher identity (>47%) with molluscans, but lower identity with other species. Phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method revealed a distinct evolutionary pathway for molluscans. Transcriptional analysis by SYBR Green qPCR showed the highest expression of HdCAV1 mRNA in late veliger stage, as compared to that in other embryonic developmental stages of disk abalone. In adult animals, gill tissue showed highest HdCAV1 transcript levels under normal physiological condition. Stimulations with two bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes), viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and two pathogen-associated molecular patterns (LPS and poly I:C) significantly modulated the expression of HdCAV1 transcripts. Collectively, these data suggest that CAV1 plays an important role in embryogenesis and host immune defense in disk abalone.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the first PfSPZ Vaccine trial ever in a malaria-endemic population, Vδ2 γδ T cells were significantly elevated and Vγ9/Vδ2 transcripts ranked as the most upregulated in vaccinees who were protected from  infection. In a mouse model, absence of γδ T cells during vaccination impaired protective CD8 T cell responses and ablated sterile protection. γδ T cells were not required for circumsporozoite protein-specific Ab responses, and γδ T cell depletion before infectious challenge did not ablate protection. γδ T cells alone were insufficient to induce protection and required the presence of CD8α dendritic cells. In the absence of γδ T cells, CD8α dendritic cells did not accumulate in the livers of vaccinated mice.

In Exp. 1, 42 barrows (63.8 ± 2.1 kg BW) were allotted to seven diets in a completely randomized design with six replicates per diet. Diets included a corn-soybean meal (SBM) diet and six additional diets containing 4.85%, 9.70%, 19.40%, 29.10%, 38.80%, or 48.50% CGM.

Chromic oxide (0.3%) was included in all diets as an indigestible marker. Pigs were fed daily at 4% of BW during each period, which consisted of 5 d of diet adaptation followed by 2 d of digesta collection. The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of , Thr, and Ala and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and  varied (P < 0.01) among the 10 CGM. The AID of CP and all AA except Pro and , and the SID of all AA except Pro were the greatest (P < 0.05) in sample 7. The AID and SID of CP averaged 40.47% and 64.75%, respectively, and varied from 32.30% to 54.87% and from 57.48% to 72.15%, respectively. The average SID of Lys, Met, Thr, and Trp was 65.61%, 76.15%, 65.29%, and 60.17%, respectively, with a SEM of 4.49, 2.40, 5.95, and 6.82, respectively. The average SID of Pro was 101.76%, with an SEM of 17.26. Increasing dietary CGM decreased the ATTD of nutrients, the DE and ME values of diets but CGM. The AID and SID of AA in CGM are low but source dependent, and CGM may be fed to pigs as an protein-rich feedstuff.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25414363>Ustiloxins, fungal cyclic peptides, are ribosomally synthesized in Ustilaginoidea virens.</a></h2><p>Ustiloxins A and B are toxic cyclic tetrapeptides, -Val/Ala--Gly (Y-V/A-I-G), that were originally identified from Ustilaginoidea virens, a pathogenic fungus affecting rice plants. Contrary to our report that ustiloxin B is ribosomally synthesized in Aspergillus flavus, a recent report suggested that ustiloxins are synthesized by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase in U.virens. Thus, we analyzed the U.virens genome, to identify the responsible gene cluster.The biosynthetic gene cluster was identified from the genome of U.virens based on homologies to the ribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene cluster for ustiloxin B identified from A.flavus. It contains a gene encoding precursor protein having five -Val--Gly and three -Ala--Gly motifs for ustiloxins A and B, respectively, strongly indicating that ustiloxins A and B from U.virens are ribosomally synthesized.Accession codes of the U.virens and A.flavus gene clusters in NCBI are BR001221 and BR001206, respectively.

Previously, we have shown unintended incorporation of tyrosine () and leucine/isoleucine (Leu/) at phenylalanine (Phe) positions in a recombinant produced monoclonal antibody (mAb) using an orthogonal MASCOT/SIEVE based approach for mass spectrometry data analysis. The misincorporation could be avoided by sufficient supply of phenylalanine throughout the process. Several non-annotated signals in the primarily chromatographic peptide separation step for apparently single Phe→ sequence variants (SVs) suggest a role for isobar tyrosine isoforms. Meta- and ortho- are spontaneously generated during aerobic fed-batch production processes using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Process induced meta- and ortho- but not proteinogenic para- are incorporated at Phe locations in Phe-starved CHO cultures expressing a recombinant mAb. Furthermore, meta- and ortho- are preferably misincorporated over Leu. Structural modeling of the l-phenylalanyl-tRNA-synthetase (PheRS) substrate activation site indicates a possible fit of non-cognate ortho- and meta- substrates. Dose-dependent misincorporations of  isoforms support the hypothesis that meta- and ortho- are competing, alternative substrates for PheRS in CHO processes. Finally, easily accessible at-line surrogate markers for Phe→ SV formation in biotherapeutic production were defined by the calculation of critical ratios for meta-/Phe and ortho-/Phe to support early prediction of SV probability, and finally, to allow for immediate process controlled Phe→ SV prevention.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25172761>Purification and characterization of three antioxidant peptides from protein hydrolyzate of croceine croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) muscle.</a></h2><p>Three antioxidant peptides were purified from protein hydrolysate of croceine croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) muscle prepared using pepsin and alcalase, and identified as -Leu-Met-Ser-Arg (PC-1), Val-Leu--Glu-Glu (PC-2), and Met--Leu-Met-Arg (PC-3) with molecular weights of 651.77, 668.82, and 662.92Da, respectively.

Twenty-two growing barrows (25.5 ± 1.73 kg) were fitted with a T-cannula near the distal ileum and allotted to a 22 × 8 Youden square design. Twenty-two sources of SBM were procured from soybean crushing plants located throughout the United States. For analysis, the crushing plant locations were separated into the following 3 zones: 1) Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota ( = 4); 2) Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio ( = 11); and 3) Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska ( = 7). Dietary treatments included 22 diets based on a mixture of cornstarch, sucrose, and each source of SBM as the sole source of CP. Results indicated that the concentration of most indispensable and dispensable AA in SBM were not different among zones. However, SBM from zone 2 had a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of Thr than SBM from zone 3 and a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of Gly than SBM from zone 1. The concentration of  in SBM from zone 2 was also greater ( < 0.05) than in SBM from zones 1 and 3. However, if concentrations of AA were calculated as a percent of CP, there were no differences in the concentrations of indispensable and dispensable AA among SBM from the 3 zones. Likewise, the AID of CP and the AID of indispensable and dispensable AA were not different among SBM from the 3 zones. The SID of CP and most AA was also not different among SBM from the 3 zones. However, SBM from zone 3 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of His, Asp, and Cys than SBM from zone 2, and SBM from zone 1 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of Lys than SBM from zone 2. There was also a tendency ( < 0.10) for SBM from zone 3 to have a greater SID of , Leu, Phe, Val, Ala, and  than SBM from zone 2. If the concentrations of SID CP and AA were calculated as grams per kilogram, SBM among the 3 zones were not different with the exception that there was a tendency ( = 0.07) for SBM from zone 2 to contain more SID Thr and SID  than SBM from zone 3. In conclusion, only a few differences in concentrations and digestibility of CP and AA exist among sources of SBM from different zones in the United States. These observations indicate that the protein value is not different among SBM produced in the United States regardless of the location of the crushing plants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27935824>Helicobacter pylori VacA, acting through receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase α, is crucial for CagA phosphorylation in human duodenum carcinoma cell line AZ-521.</a></h2><p>Helicobacter pylori, a major cause of gastroduodenal diseases, produces vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) and cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), which seem to be involved in virulence. VacA exhibits pleiotropic actions in gastroduodenal disorders via its specific receptors. Recently, we found that VacA induced the phosphorylation of cellular Src kinase (Src) at Tyr418 in AZ-521 cells. Silencing of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP)α, a VacA receptor, reduced VacA-induced Src phosphorylation. Src is responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA at its Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA) variant C (EPIYA-C) motif in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells, resulting in binding of CagA to SHP-2 phosphatase. Challenging AZ-521 cells with wild-type H. pylori induced phosphorylation of CagA, but this did not occur when challenged with a vacA gene-disrupted mutant strain. CagA phosphorylation was observed in cells infected with a vacA gene-disrupted mutant strain after addition of purified VacA, suggesting that VacA is required for H. pylori-induced CagA phosphorylation. Following siRNA-mediated RPTPα knockdown in AZ-521 cells, infection with wild-type H. pylori and treatment with VacA did not induce CagA phosphorylation. Taken together, these results support our conclusion that VacA mediates CagA phosphorylation through RPTPα in AZ-521 cells. These data indicate the possibility that Src phosphorylation induced by VacA is mediated through RPTPα, resulting in activation of Src, leading to CagA phosphorylation at Tyr972 in AZ-521 cells.© 2016.

Proteolysis induced by residual proteases in commercial lactase was studied in a system using purified β-casein or β-lactoglobulin during a 60-day storage period at 22 or 38 °C. The proteolysis of β-casein by residual proteases occurred more extensively than that of β-lactoglobulin. Peptidomic analysis by LC-ESI-MS/MS revealed that , Leu, , and Phe residues near the C-terminus of β-casein were the main sites of cleavage by the residual proteases, generating assumed bitter peptides. In the subsequent in vitro digestion study, proteolysis during storage was shown to greatly affect the subsequent digestibility of β-casein, leading to an elevated degree of hydrolysis and the formation of new digested peptides. This study highlights the potential influence of residual proteases in commercial lactase on the storage quality and digestibility of LH milk containing active lactase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29993582>Identification and Analysis of Key Residues in Protein-RNA Complexes.</a></h2><p>Protein-RNA complexes play important roles in various biological processes. The functions of protein-RNA complexes are dictated by their interactions, binding, stability, and affinity. In this work, we have identified the key residues (KRs), which are involved in both stability and binding. We found that 42 percent of considered proteins share common binding and stabilizing residues, whereas these residues are distinct in 58 percent of the proteins. Overall, 5 percent of stabilizing and 3 percent of binding residues serve as key residues. These residues are enriched with the combination of polar, charged, aliphatic, and aromatic residues. Analysis on subclasses of protein-RNA complexes based on protein structural class, function and RNA type showed that regulatory proteins, and complexes with single stranded RNA and rRNA have appreciable number of key residues. Specifically, Arg, , and Thr are preferred in most of the subclasses of protein-RNA complexes. In addition, residues with similar chemical behavior have different preferences to be KRs, such that Arg, , Val, and Thr are preferred over Lys, Trp, , and Ser, respectively. Atomic level contacts revealed that charged and polar-nonpolar contacts are dominant in enzymes, polar in structural, and nonpolar in regulatory proteins. On the other hand, polar-nonpolar contacts are enriched in all these classes of protein-RNA complexes. Further, the influence of sequence and structural features such as conservation score, surrounding hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility, secondary structure, and long-range order in key residues are also discussed. We envisage that the present study provides insights to understand the structural and functional aspects of protein-RNA complexes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26807980>Ribosomal Synthesis of Peptides with Multiple β-Amino Acids.</a></h2><p>The compatibility of β-amino acids with ribosomal translation was studied for decades, but it has been still unclear whether the ribosome can accept various β-amino acids, and whether the ribosome can introduce multiple β-amino acids in a peptide. In the present study, by using the Escherichia coli reconstituted cell-free translation system with a reprogramed genetic code, we screened β-amino acids that give high single incorporation efficiency and used them to synthesize peptides containing multiple β-amino acids. The experiments of single β-amino acid incorporation into a peptide revealed that 13 β-amino acids are compatible with ribosomal translation. Six of the tested β-amino acids (βhGly, l-βhAla, l-βhGln, l-βhPhg, l-βhMet, and d-βhPhg) showed high incorporation efficiencies, and seven (l-βhLeu, l-βhIle, l-βhAsn, l-βhPhe, l-βhLys, d-βhAla, and d-βhLeu) showed moderate incorporation efficiencies; whereas no full-length peptide was produced using other β-amino acids (l-βhPro, l-βhTrp, and l-βhGlu). Subsequent double-incorporation experiments using β-amino acids with high single incorporation efficiency revealed that elongation of peptides with successive β-amino acids is prohibited. Efficiency of the double-incorporation of the β-amino acids was restored by the insertion of  or  between the two β-amino acids. On the basis of these experiments, we also designed mRNA sequences of peptides, and demonstrated the ribosomal synthesis of peptides containing different types of β-amino acids at multiple positions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28445260>Association of CagA EPIYA-D or EPIYA-C phosphorylation sites with peptic ulcer and gastric cancer risks: A meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Increasingly, studies have focused on the relationship between Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) cytotoxin associated gene A protein (CagA) Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA)-D motifs or multiple EPIYA-C phosphorylation sites and peptic ulcer disease (PUD) or gastric cancer (GC) risk. However, the conclusions have been inconsistent. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether 1 CagA EPIYA-D motif or multiple EPIYA-C phosphorylation sites were associated with PUD or GC risk.A literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang Data, Excerpt Medica Database, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database to identify eligible research. We analyzed the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to assess the strength of association.Compared with 1 EPIYA-C motif in Asian populations, 1 EPIYA-D site was associated with an increased GC risk (OR=1.91, 95% CI=1.19-3.07, P = .008). However, 1 EPIYA-D motif was not significantly associated with PUD (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.46-1.76, P = .764), gastric ulcer (GU) (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.27-2.63, P = .771), or duodenal ulcer (DU) (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.25-3.16, P = .859) risk. Compared with no more than 1 EPIYA-C motif, multiple motifs were associated with increased PUD (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.29-4.20, P = .005) and DU (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.08-5.00, P = .031) risk in Asia and GC risk in the United States and Europe (OR = 3.28, 95% CI = 2.32-4.64, P < .001). Multiple EPIYA-C sites were not associated with GU risk (OR = 4.54, 95% CI = 0.95-21.83, P = .059). There was no publication bias identified in these comparisons.In Asia, 1 EPIYA-D motif was significantly associated with increased GC risk. Multiple EPIYA-C motifs were associated with increased PUD and DU risk, particularly in Asia. In the United States and Europe, multiple EPIYA-C motifs were associated with increased GC risk. Therefore, detection of polymorphic CagA EPIYA motifs may improve clinical prediction of disease risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844736>Structure and binding studies of proliferating cell nuclear antigen from Leishmania donovani.</a></h2><p>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a sliding clamp to support DNA replication and repair. The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73Å resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42° about the pore axis and shifted by 7Å and tilted by 16° along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32Å. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg-Ser-Thr-Lys-Ser-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg-Lys--Gly-Lys-Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ala--226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg------224-Asn-Ala--226. The enhanced length of this segment in LdPCNA may influence its mode of interaction with DNA and other proteins. The dissociation constants obtained using real time binding studies with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for two peptides, Lys-Arg-Arg-Gln-Thr-Ser-Met-Thr-Asp-Phe--His (P1) from human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1(CKI-1) and Lys-Thr-Gln-Gly-Arg-Leu-Asp-Ser-Phe-Phe-Thr-Val (P2) from flap endonuclease 1 (Fen-1) as well as with two small molecule inhibitors, (S)-4-(4-(2-amino-3-hydroxypropyl)-2, 6-diiodophenoxy) phenol hydrochloride (ADPH) and N-(3-methylthiophene-2-carboxylicacid)-N'-((3-hydroxy-2-naphthalenyl) methylene) hydrazide (MCMH) are 0.29±0.09μM, 0.37±0.08μM, 0.35±0.09μM and 1.20±0.08μM respectively.

We investigated the role of (B26), a conserved aromatic residue at this interface. To probe the evolutionary basis for such conservation, we constructed 18 variants at B26. Surprisingly, non-aromatic polar or charged side chains (such as Glu, Ser, or ornithine (Orn)) conferred high activity, whereas the weakest-binding analogs contained Val, , and Leu substitutions. Modeling of variant complexes suggested that the B26 side chains pack within a shallow depression at the solvent-exposed periphery of the interface. This interface would disfavor large aliphatic side chains. The analogs with highest activity exhibited reduced thermodynamic stability and heightened susceptibility to fibrillation. Perturbed self-assembly was also demonstrated in studies of the charged variants (Orn and Glu); indeed, the Glu(B26) analog exhibited aberrant aggregation in either the presence or absence of zinc ions. Thus, although (B26) is part of insulin's receptor-binding surface, our results suggest that its conservation has been enjoined by the aromatic ring's contributions to native stability and self-assembly. We envisage that such classical structural relationships reflect the implicit threat of toxic misfolding (rather than hormonal function at the receptor level) as a general evolutionary determinant of extant protein sequences.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26921428>Isolation and Structural Elucidation of Brevibacillin, an Antimicrobial Lipopeptide from Brevibacillus laterosporus That Combats Drug-Resistant Gram-Positive Bacteria.</a></h2><p>A new environmental bacterial strain exhibited strong antimicrobial characteristics against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus plantarum, and other Gram-positive bacteria. The producer strain, designated OSY-I1, was determined to be Brevibacillus laterosporusvia morphological, biochemical, and genetic analyses. The antimicrobial agent was extracted from cells of OSY-I1 with isopropanol, purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and structurally analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The MS and NMR results, taken together, uncovered a linear lipopeptide consisting of 13 amino acids and an N-terminal C6 fatty acid (FA) chain, 2-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid. The lipopeptide (FA-Dhb-Leu-Orn---Val-Lys-Val-Val-Lys--Leu-valinol, where Dhb is α,β-didehydrobutyric acid and valinol is 2-amino-3-methyl-1-butanol) has a molecular mass of 1,583.0794 Da and contains three modified amino acid residues: α,β-didehydrobutyric acid, ornithine, and valinol. The compound, designated brevibacillin, was determined to be a member of a cationic lipopeptide antibiotic family. In addition to its potency against drug-resistant bacteria, brevibacillin also exhibited low MICs (1 to 8 μg/ml) against selected foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes,Bacillus cereus, and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris Purified brevibacillin showed no sign of degradation when it was held at 80 °C for 60 min, and it retained at least 50% of its antimicrobial activity when it was held for 22 h under acidic or alkaline conditions. On the basis of these findings, brevibacillin is a potent antimicrobial lipopeptide which is potentially useful to combat drug-resistant bacterial pathogens and foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Adding extra protein-bound or free AA to the diet may correct the reduced AA intake of HS pigs. However, extra protein-bound AA may further increase the body heat load, whereas extra free AA does not affect the heat load of HS pigs. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, the performance depression because of HS, compared with thermal neutrality, was determined with 30 pigs (31.1 ± 1.2 kg BW) fed diets with AA only as protein or as a mix of protein and free AA. Heat stress pigs consumed 18 to 25% less Lys and Thr than thermal neutral. In Exp. 2, the effect of extra dietary protein-bound or free AA on performance and serum concentration of AA in 25 HS pigs (33.6 ± 0.65 kg BW) was evaluated. Treatments were as follows: CON, wheat-soybean meal-free Lys-Thr-Met diet; xP diet, 26% more protein than the CON diet; xAA diet, 24% or more of each AA than the recommended level. Pigs were fed ad libitum. Blood samples were collected between 1600 and 1700 h, when pigs were exposed to the highest ambient temperature (around 41.3 °C). Body temperature ranged daily from 39.9 to 41.1 °C. The performance data were reported already. Pigs fed the xP diet consumed more of all indispensable AA and dispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05), and more Arg, , Asp, Glu, Gly, and Ser (P < 0.05) than the xAA pigs. Except for Arg, xAA pigs consumed more indispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Arg, His, Lys, Phe, Thr, Trp, and Val, was higher (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Except for  serum, indispensable AA were higher in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum , Leu, Thr, and Val were higher (P < 0.05), and Met tended to be higher (P < 0.10) in xAA than in xP pigs. The difference of , Leu, Met, Thr, and Val between the CON and the xAA pigs was larger than that between the CON and the xP pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Asn and  were higher, and Cys and Glu were lower (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Serum Cys tended to be lower in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.10). Asp and Glu were higher (P < 0.05) in xAA pigs than in xP pigs. In conclusion, these serum AA results combined with the reported performance data indicate that extra free AA in diets for HS pigs may help to correct the reduced AA availability and performance of HS pigs, although higher levels of specific AA such as  and Met might be needed.© The Author(s) 2019.

Plants and/or fungi can catabolize JA into the bioactive jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-) that in turn activates the JA--pathway in planta. To extend our knowledge on JA-derivates related to natural occurring JA conjugates, N-[(-)-jasmonyl]-S-tyrosin (JA-) and the ester JA-Sei between JA and seiridin, a fungal disubstituted furanone, were synthesized. The classical procedures for ester synthesis were applied for compound JA-Sei, while N-[(-)-jasmonyl]-S-tyrosin was synthesized with an optimized procedure. JA- and JA-Sei were characterized by spectroscopic method (essentially 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS) and their stereochemical composition was determined by means of HPLC and circular dichroism analysis. Finally, the activity of these JA-derivates was analyzed in planta. JA- and JA-Sei trigger JA-regulated plant responses, such as protein degradation and growth inhibition. These effects require the conversion of JA into JA- and its recognition by the plant JA- perception complex COI1-JAZ. Overall, these data suggest a mode-of-action of JA- and JA-Sei as inactive pool of JA that can be transformed into the bioactive JA- to induce the canonical JA--pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that compared with high wort gravity (24°P), high ethanol concentration (10%, v/v) decreased yeast growth, cell viability, and wort fermentability significantly. The assimilation of FAAs was changed dramatically by high ethanol toxicity, and positive correlations between the assimilation amounts of 10 FAAs (Asp, Ser, Gly, Arg, , Val, Met, Lys, , and Leu) and fermentation performance (cell viability, fermentability, and ethanol production) were identified, especially for Arg and Lys exhibiting extremely significant positive correlations. Furthermore, confirmatory testing was carried out by supplementing 24°P worts with 10 FAAs of 0.5, 1, and 2 times of their standard concentrations, respectively. Results exhibited that 10 FAA supplementations improved physiological characteristics and fermentation performance of lager yeast significantly, especially for 1 times FAA supplementation increasing wort fermentability and ethanol yield by 6 and 17%, respectively, and upregulated the expression level of HSP12 and increased more intracellular trehalose accumulation in yeast cells, indicating that stronger protective function was stimulated in yeast cells.

By this MALDI-TOF-MS/MS coupled with amino acid analysis, it was revealed that iturin at m/z 1,043 consists of a circular Asn--Asn-Gln-Pro-Asn-Ser peptide and C14 β-OH fatty acid. Surfactin homologs from Bacillus subtilis THY-7 at m/z 1,030, 1,044, 1,058, and 1,072 possess a circular Glu-Leu-Leu-Val-Asp-Leu-Leu peptide and the β-OH fatty acid with a different length (C13-C16). Fengycin species at m/z 1,463 and 1,477 are homologs possessing the circular peptide Glu-Orn--Thr-Glu-Ala-Pro-Gln-- linked to a C16 or C17 γ-OH fatty acid, whereas fengycin at m/z 1,505 contains a Glu-Orn--Thr-Glu-Val-Pro-Gln-- sequence with a Val instead of Ala at position 6. The method developed in this work provided an efficient approach for characterization of diverse lipopeptide isoforms from the iturin, fengycin, and surfactin families.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26733187>Molecular dynamics of sialic acid analogues complex with cholera toxin and DFT optimization of ethylene glycol-mediated zinc nanocluster conjugation.</a></h2><p>Cholera is an infectious disease caused by cholera toxin (CT) protein of bacterium Vibrio cholerae. A sequence of sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, NeuNAc or Neu5Ac) analogues modified in its C-5 position is modelled using molecular modelling techniques and docked against the CT followed by molecular dynamics simulations. Docking results suggest better binding affinity of NeuNAc analogue towards the binding site of CT. The NeuNAc analogues interact with the active site residues GLU:11, :12, HIS:13, GLY:33, LYS:34, GLU:51, GLN:56, HIE:57, :58, GLN:61, TRP:88, ASN:90 and LYS:91 through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Analogues N-glycolyl-NeuNAc, N-Pentanoyl-NeuNAc and N-Propanoyl-NeuNAc show the least XPGscore (docking score) of -9.90, -9.16, and -8.91, respectively, and glide energy of -45.99, -42.14 and -41.66 kcal/mol, respectively. Stable nature of CT-N-glycolyl-NeuNAc, CT-N-Pentanoyl-NeuNAc and CT-N-Propanoyl-NeuNAc complexes was verified through molecular dynamics simulations, each for 40 ns using the software Desmond. All the nine NeuNAc analogues show better score for drug-like properties, so could be considered as suitable candidates for drug development for cholera infection. To improve the enhanced binding mode of NeuNAc analogues towards CT, the nine NeuNAc analogues are conjugated with Zn nanoclusters through ethylene glycol (EG) as carriers. The NeuNAc analogues conjugated with EG-Zn nanoclusters show better binding energy towards CT than the unconjugated nine NeuNAc analogues. The electronic structural optimization of EG-Zn nanoclusters was carried out for optimizing their performance as better delivery vehicles for NeuNAc analogues through density functional theory calculations. These sialic acid analogues may be considered as novel leads for the design of drug against cholera and the EG-Zn nanocluster may be a suitable carrier for sialic acid analogues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25963389>Identification of a novel amino acid racemase from a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT-3 induced by D-amino acids.</a></h2><p>To date, there have been few reports analyzing the amino acid requirement for growth of hyperthermophilic archaea. We here found that the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT-3 requires Thr, Leu, Val, Phe, , Trp, His and Arg in the medium for growth, and shows slow growth in medium lacking Met or . This largely corresponds to the presence, or absence, of genes related to amino acid biosynthesis in its genome, though there are exceptions. The amino acid requirements were dramatically lost by addition of D-isomers of Met, Leu, Val, allo-, Phe, , Trp and Arg. Tracer analysis using (14)C-labeled D-Trp showed that D-Trp in the medium was used as a protein component in the cells, suggesting the presence of D-amino acid  enzymes. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent racemase activity toward Met, Leu and Phe was detected in crude extract of P. horikoshii and was enhanced in cells grown in the medium supplemented with D-amino acids, especially D-allo-. The gene encoding the racemase was narrowed down to one open reading frame on the basis of enzyme purification from P. horikoshii cells, and the recombinant enzyme exhibited PLP-dependent racemase activity toward several amino acids, including Met, Leu and Phe, but not Pro, Asp or Glu. This is the first report showing the presence in a hyperthermophilic archaeon of a PLP-dependent amino acid racemase with broad substrate specificity that is likely responsible for utilization of D-amino acids for growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28380619>Effects of ileal digesta collection time on standardized ileal digestibility of amino acids in corn, soybean meal, and distiller's dried grains with solubles fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>The objective of this experiment was to determine the minimum collection time needed to obtain representative samples of ileal digesta from pigs fed different types of diets. Eight barrows with an initial BW of 34.6 kg (SD 2.1) were individually fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and randomly allotted to a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 diets and 4 periods per square. Three diets contained corn, soybean meal (SBM), or distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS) as the sole source of CP. An N-free diet was also prepared. All diets contained 0.5% chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. Equal meals were provided at 0800 and 2000 h. Ileal digesta samples were collected in 2-h intervals from 0800 to 2000 h during the last 3 d of each 7-d period. When pigs were fed the corn diet, the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of most indispensable AA and dispensable AA increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) during each of the six 2-h periods. The SID of most AA were less ( < 0.05) if the ileal digesta samples were collected from 1800 to 2000 h or from 1600 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. When pigs were fed the SBM diet, the SID of , Leu, Thr, Trp, Val, Ala, and Cys increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) but the SID of all other AA linearly decreased ( < 0.05) during the six 2-h periods. The SID of almost all AA were greater ( < 0.05) if the ileal samples were collected from 0800 to 1000 h, from 0800 to 1200 h, from 1000 to 1400 h, or from 0800 to 1400 h but less ( < 0.05) if collected from 1600 to 1800 h, from 1800 to 2000 h, from 1600 to 2000 h, or from 1400 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. When pigs were fed the DDGS-based diet, the SID of , Leu, Lys, Phe, Trp, Val, and  increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) during the six 2-h periods. The SID of most AA were less ( < 0.05) if the ileal samples were collected from 1800 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. In conclusion, diurnal variations in SID of AA in pigs indicate that 6 h of ileal sample collection starting 4 or 6 h after feeding may provide representative samples of ileal digesta from pigs fed different types of diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26981137>The Dipeptides - and Ser- Exert Distinct Effects on Catecholamine  in the Mouse Brainstem.</a></h2><p>Catecholamine synthesis and transmission in the brain are influenced by the availability of  in the body. In this study, we compared the effects of oral administration of -containing dipeptides -, Ser-, and -Pro with  alone on catecholamine  in the mouse brainstem. Among these dipeptides, - administration led to increases in dopamine, the dopamine metabolites homovanillic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, compared to administration of Ser-, -Pro, or  alone. In comparison, administration of Ser- induced significantly increasing noradrenaline turnover, while -Pro administration suppressed dopamine turnover. Therefore, oral administration of -, Ser-, and -Pro differentially affected  of dopamine and noradrenaline.

Herein, the generation of well-defined scaffolds of Gly---Gly-Ser-Arg (GYIGSR) peptide-functionalized poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) aligned nanofibers are used to accelerate the neural lineage commitment and differentiation of D3 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Gene expression trends and immunocytochemistry analysis were similar to laminin-coated glass, and indicated an earlier differentiation progression than D3 mESCs on laminin. Further, GYIGSR-functionalized nanofiber substrates yielded an increased gene expression of Sox1, a neural progenitor cell marker, and Tubb3, Cdh2, Syp, neuronal cell markers, at early time points. In addition, guidance of neurites was found to parallel the fiber direction. We demonstrate the fabrication of a well-defined, xeno-free functional nanofiber scaffold and demonstrates its use as a surrogate for xenogenic and complex matrixes currently used for the neural differentiation of stem cells ex vivo.In this paper, we report the use of GYIGSR-functionalized poly(ε-caprolactone) aligned nanofibers as a tool to accelerate the neural lineage commitment and differentiation of D3 mouse embryonic stem cells. The results indicate that functional nanofiber substrates promote faster differentiation than laminin coated substrates. The data suggest that aligned nanofibers and post-electrospinning surface modification with bioactive species can be combined to produce translationally relevant xeno-free substrates for stem cell therapy. Future development efforts are focused on additional bioactive species that are able to function as surrogates for other xenogenic factors found in differentiation media.Copyright © 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

CDI(+) bacteria deliver the toxic C-terminal region of contact-dependent inhibition A proteins (CdiA-CT) into neighboring target bacteria and produce CDI immunity proteins (CdiI) to protect against self-inhibition. The CdiA-CT(EC536) deployed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli 536 (EC536) is a bacterial toxin 28 (Ntox28) domain that only exhibits ribonuclease activity when bound to the cysteine biosynthetic enzyme O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A (CysK). Here, we present crystal structures of the CysK/CdiA-CT(EC536) binary complex and the neutralized ternary complex of CysK/CdiA-CT/CdiI(EC536) CdiA-CT(EC536) inserts its C-terminal Gly--Gly- peptide tail into the active-site cleft of CysK to anchor the interaction. Remarkably, E. coli serine O-acetyltransferase uses a similar Gly-Asp-Gly- motif to form the "cysteine synthase" complex with CysK. The cysteine synthase complex is found throughout bacteria, protozoa, and plants, indicating that CdiA-CT(EC536) exploits a highly conserved protein-protein interaction to promote its toxicity. CysK significantly increases CdiA-CT(EC536) thermostability and is required for toxin interaction with tRNA substrates. These observations suggest that CysK stabilizes the toxin fold, thereby organizing the nuclease active site for substrate recognition and catalysis. By contrast, Ntox28 domains from Gram-positive bacteria lack C-terminal Gly--Gly- motifs, suggesting that they do not interact with CysK. We show that the Ntox28 domain from Ruminococcus lactaris is significantly more thermostable than CdiA-CT(EC536), and its intrinsic tRNA-binding properties support CysK-independent nuclease activity. The striking differences between related Ntox28 domains suggest that CDI toxins may be under evolutionary pressure to maintain low global stability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26706905>Interaction of Quercetin of Onion with Axon Guidance Protein Receptor, NRP-1 Plays Important Role in Cancer Treatment: An In Silico Approach.</a></h2><p>Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor whose distinct sites bind semaphorins and vascular endothelial growth factor family members to mediate the role of these ligands in neuronal axon guidance and angiogenesis, respectively. Similarly, Eph receptors and ephrin ligands play critical roles in various biological functions, and deregulated activation of Eph/ephrin signaling in humans is thought to lead to tumorigenesis. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt was made to elucidate the inhibition potential of nine bioactive compounds from four different native spices of Bangladesh against this couple of receptors via molecular docking study. The molecular docking study was carried out using Vina docking protocol. Finally, the receptor-ligand interaction analysis was carried out using the Discovery Studio Client package. Quercetin and diosgenin of onion showed favorable binding with NRP-1 with low binding energy of -7.8 and -7.2 kcal/mol, respectively, in comparison with the control inhibitor (-6.1 kcal/mol). The study suggests that ligand interaction with the residues Asp 48, Thr 44, Thr 77,  81, Trp29,  143 of NRP-1 and Lys 653, Phe 765, Ser 763, Thr 699,  683 of Eph might be critical for the inhibitory activity of these receptors. The study provides evidence for consideration of quercetin and diosgenin of onion as valuable small ligand molecules for targeting NRP-1 receptor in treatment and prevention of neurological disorders as well as cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27173542>Interaction between dietary bioactive peptides of short length and bile salts in submicellar or micellar state.</a></h2><p>Bile salts act as steroidal detergents in the gut, and could also interact with peptides and improve their bioavailability, although the mechanism is unclear. The occurrence of direct interaction between milk bioactive peptides, -Asn--Trp, Leu-Asp-Gln-Trp, and Leu-Gln-Lys-Trp, and different bile salts in the submicellar or micellar state was investigated by intrinsic fluorescence measurement and dynamic light scattering, above the critical micellar concentration, the latter being determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. The peptides form aggregates, spontaneously. In the presence of bile salts, some released peptide monomers were bound to the micellar surface. The lack of hydrogen bonding involving the C12OH group of the steroid skeleton, and the acidic function of some bile salts, might promote the interaction with the peptides, as could the lack of the C12OH group, rather than that of the C7OH group. At submicellar concentrations, sodium taurochenodeoxycholate and taurodeoxycholate readily interacted with the most hydrophobic peptide -Asn--Trp.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, peptide Lys-Leu and a free amino acid (FAA) mixture of Lys and Leu (Lys + Leu) were supplemented in 24 °P wort to examine their effects on physiological activity and fermentation performance of brewer's yeast during very high-gravity (VHG) wort fermentation. Results showed that although both peptide Lys-Leu and their FAA mixture supplementations could increase the growth and viability, intracellular trehalose and glycerol content, wort fermentability, and ethanol content for brewer's yeast during VHG wort fermentation, and peptide was better than their FAA mixture at promoting growth and fermentation for brewer's yeast when the same dose was kept. Moreover, peptide Lys-Leu supplementation significantly increased the assimilation of Asp, but decreased the assimilation of Gly, Ala, Val, (Cys)2, , Leu, , Phe, Lys, Arg, and Pro. However, the FAA mixture supplementation only promoted the assimilation of Lys and Leu, while reduced the absorption of total amino acids to a greater extent. Thus, the peptide Lys-Leu was more effective than their FAA mixture on the improvement of physiological activity, fermentation performance, and nitrogen  of brewer's yeast during VHG wort fermentation.© 2017 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27655443>Therapeutic brain modulation with targeted large neutral amino acid supplements in the Pah-enu2 phenylketonuria mouse model.</a></h2><p>Phenylketonuria treatment consists mainly of a Phe-restricted diet, which leads to suboptimal neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes. Supplementation of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) has been suggested as an alternative dietary treatment strategy to optimize neurocognitive outcome in phenylketonuria and has been shown to influence 3 brain pathobiochemical mechanisms in phenylketonuria, but its optimal composition has not been established.In order to provide additional pathobiochemical insight and develop optimal LNAA treatment, several targeted LNAA supplements were investigated with respect to all 3 biochemical disturbances underlying brain dysfunction in phenylketonuria.Pah-enu2 (PKU) mice received 1 of 5 different LNAA-supplemented diets beginning at postnatal day 45. Control groups included phenylketonuria mice receiving an isonitrogenic and isocaloric high-protein diet or the AIN-93M diet, and wild-type mice receiving the AIN-93M diet. After 6 wk, brain and plasma amino acid profiles and brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations were measured.Brain Phe concentrations were most effectively reduced by supplementation of LNAAs, such as Leu and , with a strong affinity for the LNAA transporter type 1. Brain non-Phe LNAAs could be restored on supplementation, but unbalanced LNAA supplementation further reduced brain concentrations of those LNAAs that were not (sufficiently) included in the LNAA supplement. To optimally ameliorate brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations, LNAA supplementation should include  and Trp together with LNAAs that effectively reduce brain Phe concentrations. The requirement for  supplementation is higher than it is for Trp, and the relative effect of brain Phe reduction is higher for serotonin than it is for dopamine and norepinephrine.The study shows that all 3 biochemical disturbances underlying brain dysfunction in phenylketonuria can be targeted by specific LNAA supplements. The study thus provides essential information for the development of optimal LNAA supplementation as an alternative dietary treatment strategy to optimize neurocognitive outcome in patients with phenylketonuria.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25498386>Experimental validation of plant peroxisomal targeting prediction algorithms by systematic comparison of in vivo import efficiency and in vitro PTS1 binding affinity.</a></h2><p>Most peroxisomal matrix proteins possess a C-terminal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1). Accurate prediction of functional PTS1 sequences and their relative strength by computational methods is essential for determination of peroxisomal proteomes in silico but has proved challenging due to high levels of sequence variability of non-canonical targeting signals, particularly in higher plants, and low levels of availability of experimentally validated non-canonical examples. In this study, in silico predictions were compared with in vivo targeting analyses and in vitro thermodynamic binding of mutated variants within the context of one model targeting sequence. There was broad agreement between the methods for entire PTS1 domains and position-specific single amino acid residues, including residues upstream of the PTS1 tripeptide. The hierarchy Leu>Met>>Val at the C-terminal position was determined for all methods but both experimental approaches suggest that  is underweighted in the prediction algorithm due to the absence of this residue in the positive training dataset. A combination of methods better defines the score range that discriminates a functional PTS1. In vitro binding to the PEX5 receptor could discriminate among strong targeting signals while in vivo targeting assays were more sensitive, allowing detection of weak functional import signals that were below the limit of detection in the binding assay. Together, the data provide a comprehensive assessment of the factors driving PTS1 efficacy and provide a framework for the more quantitative assessment of the protein import pathway in higher plants.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, in this study different diets were tested for the determination of endogenous losses (EL) of amino acids (AA) and nitrogen (N) assuming a complete absorption in the small intestine. Seven cannulated gilts received a protein-free diet (Diet PF) or diets with 3%, 6% or 10% crude protein (CP) from crystalline AA (Diets CA) or casein (Diets CAS) according to a 7 × 7 Latin square design. After 6 d adaptation to the diet, ileal digesta was collected for 24 h and thereafter analysed for AA, N and the digestibility markers CrO and acid insoluble ash (AIA). Generally, among all AA, the highest amounts of EL were found for Pro, Glu and Gly, and the smallest for Met. Different levels of CP in Diets CA and CAS had no effect on EL.

Ross 308 male broilers (400 total) were housed in battery cages from 1 to 21 d post-hatch and received common corn-soybean meal-based diets throughout the experiment. At 9 d post-hatch, birds were individually weighed and allotted to 4 treatment groups with 10 replicate cages of 10 birds per cage. At 15 d post-hatch, all birds were inoculated with 1 mL of distilled water that contained 0, 2.5 × 10(5), 5.0 × 10(5), or 1.0 × 10(6) sporulated E. acervulina oocysts. At 21 d, birds were euthanized for collection of blood and ileal digesta. Body weight gain and feed efficiency decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing E. acervulina dose. With the exception of Trp and Gly, AID values decreased (P < 0.05) linearly or quadratically for all amino acids by an average of 2.6 percentage units for birds inoculated with 1.0 × 10(6) oocysts compared with uninfected birds. Infection with E. acervulina caused a quadratic decrease (P < 0.05) in plasma carotenoid concentrations. Plasma concentrations of Arg and  decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing E. acervulina inoculation dose and plasma Gln and Asn decreased quadratically (P < 0.01). Linear increases (P < 0.05) were observed for plasma Lys, Leu, , Val, Pro, and Orn as E. acervulina inoculation dose increased. Plasma α1-acid glycoprotein of broilers was not influenced (P > 0.05) by E. acervulina infection. In conclusion, E. acervulina challenge adversely impacted growth performance, plasma carotenoids, and AID of amino acids in a dose-dependent manner. However, plasma amino acid responses to graded E. acervulina inoculation doses varied considerably among amino acids. Thus, these results indicated that alterations in amino acid  caused by E. acervulina infection extended beyond reduced amino acid digestibility.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29471545>High-protein distillers dried grains with solubles produced using a novel front-end-back-end fractionation technology has greater nutritional value than conventional distillers dried grains with solubles when fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Two experiments were conducted to determine the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of GE, and DE and ME in conventional distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS-CV) and in a novel source of high-protein distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS-HP) produced by Lincolnway Energy (Nevada, IA).

Therefore, we hypothesized that β-amino-acid-substituted Ang III peptide analogues would yield highly selective AT2R ligands, which we have tested in binding and functional vascular assays. In competition binding experiments using either AT1R- or AT2R-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, novel β-substituted Ang III analogues lacked appreciable AT1R affinity, whereas most compounds could fully displace (125)I-Sar(1)(8) Ang II from AT2R.

The novel analogue β-Pro(7) Ang III was the most selective AT2R ligand tested, which was >20,000-fold more selective for AT2R than AT1R. IC50 values at AT2R from binding studies correlated with maximum vasorelaxation in mouse aortic rings. Given that β-Pro(7) Ang III was an AT2R agonist, we compared β-Pro(7) Ang III and native Ang III for their ability to reduce blood pressure in separate groups of conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. Whereas Ang III alone increased mean arterial pressure (MAP), β-Pro(7) Ang III had no effect. During low-level AT1R blockade, both Ang III and β-Pro(7) Ang III, but not Ang II, lowered MAP (by ∼30 mmHg) at equimolar infusions (150 pmol/kg/min for 4 h) and these depressor effects were abolished by the co-administration of the AT2R antagonist PD123319. Thus, β-Pro(7) Ang III has remarkable AT2R selectivity determined in binding and functional studies and will be a valuable research tool for insight into AT2R function and for future drug development.© 2015 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959521>Meta-regression analysis to predict the influence of branched-chain and large neutral amino acids on growth performance of pigs1.</a></h2><p>A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), their interactions, and interactions with large neutral amino acids (LNAA) to develop prediction equations for growth performance of pigs.

The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:Lys) + (20.2659 × :Lys) - (0.1479 × :Lys × :Lys) + (9.2243 × (+Val):Leu) - (0.03321 × (+Val):Leu × (+Val):Leu) - (0.4413 × :Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × :Lys) + (1.7284 × Val:Lys) - (0.00795 × Val:Lys × Val:Lys) - (1.7594 × Met:Lys); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu:Lys negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of Val, , and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.

In May 2016, a suspected A. aequalis resistant population AHTC-06 that survived fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl applied at their field-recommended rates was collected from a wheat field in Jinji County, Anhui Province, China. This study aimed to determine the resistance profile of this AHTC-06 population to ACCase- and ALS-inhibitors, and to investigate its mechanisms of resistance to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl.Two mutations, a common -2041-Asn (ACCase gene) and a very rare Pro-197- (ALS1 gene), were both identified in resistant individual plants. The homozygous subpopulation AHTC-06F1 for the two mutations was generated, and it showed broad-spectrum resistance to APPs, DENs, and ALS-inhibiting herbicides of all five chemical families tested, with resistance index (RI) values that ranged from 2.2 to 36.5. In vitro ALS activity assays showed the ALS from the resistant population was insensitive to all the tested ALS inhibitors, with RI values ranging from 3.10 to 22.51. Pre-treatment with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and malathion significantly (P < 0.05) reversed the weed's resistance to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl, respectively. Two P450 genes, c21190_g1 and c43350_g3, were constitutively overexpressed and mesosulfuron-methyl-induced upregulated in resistant plants, for which c43350_g3 was also fenoxaprop-P-ethyl-induced upregulated.This study confirms the first case of a grass weed featuring broad-spectrum resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides due to a Pro-197- mutation in the ALS gene.

In general, long variable-arm (V-arm) structures form in tRNA(Leu), tRNA(Ser), and bacterial and organellar tRNA(). However, as we have previously reported, noncanonical V-arms occur in nematode tRNA(Gly) and tRNA(), and potentially affect translational fidelity. Here, we comprehensively analyzed 69 eukaryotic genome sequences and examined the evolutionary divergence of the V-arm-containing tRNAs. In total, 253 V-arm-containing tRNAs, with neither leucine nor serine anticodons, were identified in organisms ranging from nematodes to fungi, plants, and vertebrates. We defined them as "noncanonical V-arm-containing tRNAs" (nov-tRNAs). Moreover, 2,415 nov-tRNA-like sequences lacking some of the conserved features of tRNAs were also identified, largely in vertebrate genomes. These nov-tRNA/nov-tRNA-like sequences can be categorized into three types, based on differences in their possible evolutionary origins. The type A nov-tRNAs in nematodes probably evolved not only from tRNA(Leu) but also from tRNA(Ser) and other isotypes on several independent occasions. The type B nov-tRNAs are dispersed abundantly throughout vertebrate genomes, and seem to have originated from retrotransposable elements. The type C nov-tRNAs may have been acquired from plant chloroplasts or from bacteria through horizontal transfer. Our findings provide unexpected insight into the evolution of the tRNA molecule, which was diverse and occurred independently in nematodes, vertebrates, and plants.© The Author 2015.

The yeast proteome responds to stress and tRNA biosynthesis contributes in this response by repression of tRNA transcription and alterations of tRNA modification. Here we report that the stress response also involves processing of pre-tRNA 3' termini. By a combination of Northern analyses and RNA sequencing, we show that upon shift to elevated temperatures and/or to glycerol-containing medium, aberrant pre-tRNAs accumulate in yeast cells. For pre-tRNAUAU() and pre-tRNAUUU Lys) these aberrant forms are unprocessed at the 5' ends, but they possess extended 3' termini. Sequencing analyses showed that partial 3' processing precedes 5' processing for pre-tRNAUAU(). An aberrant pre-tRNA() that accumulates also possesses extended 3' termini, but it is processed at the 5' terminus. Similar forms of these aberrant pre-tRNAs are detected in the rex1Δ strain that is defective in 3' exonucleolytic trimming of pre-tRNAs but are absent in the lhp1Δ mutant lacking 3' end protection. We further show direct correlation between the inhibition of 3' end processing rate and the stringency of growth conditions. Moreover, under stress conditions Rex1 nuclease seems to be limiting for 3' end processing, by decreased availability linked to increased protection by Lhp1. Thus, our data document complex 3' processing that is inhibited by stress in a tRNA-type and condition-specific manner. This stress-responsive tRNA 3' end maturation process presumably contributes to fine-tune the levels of functional tRNA in budding yeast in response to environmental conditions.© 2016 Foretek et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25354707>Permethrin and its metabolites affect Cu/Zn superoxide conformation: fluorescence and in silico evidences.</a></h2><p>The proclivity of permethrin and its metabolites to affect the structure and activity of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) has been investigated by using intrinsic fluorescence and 8-ANS fluorescence techniques. In silico molecular docking investigations were carried out in order to assess the means of interaction at a molecular level between SOD and the considered ligands. Results show that both, permethrin and its metabolites are able to induce conformational variation on SOD. Permethrin and 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol metabolite induce a blue shift toward the hydrophobic amino acids Leu-101, -102, Leu-104, -110 and -111, with a significant peak increase. An opposite effect was shown by 3-phenoxy benzaldehyde and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid with a progressive reduction of tyrosine fluorescence emission, without any shift. Computational findings confirm that all the molecules considered have more than one allosteric binding site but none of them interact with SOD at its catalytic Cu/Zn cleft. Moreover, all the binding poses found are very close in binding energy thus demonstrating that there is not only a preferred interaction site but most of them are important due to their relative energy in equilibrium with a population strictly connected to the ligand concentration. In the obtained complexes, all the ligands are involved in many hydrogen bonds through their polar oxygen moieties but due to the presence of a common aromatic hydrophobic core, many hydrophobic interactions are due to the SOD nature rich in apolar amino acids. Furthermore, for each ligand it can be pointed out the presence of a highly populated docked structure with a specific interaction of permethrin and its metabolites with -108, responsible for changes in fluorescence emission.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30609694>Preparation, Identification, and Activity Evaluation of Eight Antioxidant Peptides from Protein Hydrolysate of Hairtail () Muscle.</a></h2><p>In this report, protein of hairtail () muscle was separately hydrolyzed using five kinds of proteases (alcalase, trypsin, neutrase, pepsin, and papain), and the papain- and alcalase-hydrolysates showed higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals (DPPH•) and hydroxyl radical (HO•) scavenging activity than other three protease hydrolysates. Therefore, the protein hydrolysate of hairtail muscle (HTP) was prepared using binary-enzymes hydrolysis process (papain + alcalase). Subsequently, eight antioxidant peptides were purified from HTP using membrane ultrafiltration and chromatography technology, and their amino acid sequences were identified as Gln-Asn-Asp-Glu-Arg (TJP1), Lys-Ser (TJP2), Lys-Ala (TJP3), Ala-Lys-Gly (TJP4), Thr-Lys-Ala (TJP5), Val-Lys (TJP6), Met-Lys (TJP7), and --Gly (TJP8) with molecular weights of 660.3, 233.0, 217.1, 274.1, 318.0, 245.1, 277.0, and 351.0 Da, respectively. TJP3, TJP4, and TJP8 exhibited strong scavenging activities on DPPH• (EC 0.902, 0.626, and 0.663 mg/mL, respectively), HO• (EC 1.740, 2.378, and 2.498 mg/mL, respectively), superoxide anion radical (EC 2.082, 2.538, and 1.355 mg/mL, respectively), and 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical (EC 1.652, 0.831, and 0.586 mg/mL, respectively). Moreover, TJP3, TJP4, and TJP8 showed higher reducing power and inhibiting ability on lipid peroxidation in a linoleic acid model system.

In many cases, simplification of structural studies of large protein complexes is achieved by investigation of the interaction between the protein and a weakly binding segment of its protein ligand. Detection of pairwise interactions in such complexes is a major challenge for both X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. We demonstrate that transferred nuclear Overhauser effect (TRNOE), in combination with asymmetric deuteration of a protein and a peptide ligand can be used to detect intermolecular interactions in large protein complexes with molecular weights up to ~ 100 kDa. Using this approach, we revealed interactions between tyrosine residues of a 27-residue peptide (deuterated at  and Val residues) corresponding to the N-terminal segment of the human C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) chemokine receptor, and a 43 kDa construct of gp120 envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (deuterated on all aromatics) complexed with a cluster of differentiation 4-mimic miniprotein. The complex was present mostly as a dimer as determined by T2 relaxation measurements. The TRNOE crosspeaks in the ternary complex were assigned to the specific  protons in the CCR5 peptide and to methyl protons, predominantly of isoleucine residues, and also of leucine and/or valine residues of gp120. The TRNOE/asymmetric deuteration method benefits from the sensitivity of the homonuclear NOESY experiment and does not suffer the sensitivity losses associated with isotope-edited/isotope-filtered approaches that rely on magnetization transfer between protons and heteronuclei that are bonded to them. The technique can be widely applied for studying large protein complexes that exhibit fast off-rates.© 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28155663>SCMBYK: prediction and characterization of bacterial tyrosine-kinases based on propensity scores of dipeptides.</a></h2><p>Bacterial tyrosine-kinases (BY-kinases), which play an important role in numerous cellular processes, are characterized as a separate class of enzymes and share no structural similarity with their eukaryotic counterparts. However, in silico methods for predicting BY-kinases have not been developed yet. Since these enzymes are involved in key regulatory processes, and are promising targets for anti-bacterial drug design, it is desirable to develop a simple and easily interpretable predictor to gain new insights into bacterial tyrosine phosphorylation. This study proposes a novel SCMBYK method for predicting and characterizing BY-kinases.A dataset consisting of 797 BY-kinases and 783 non-BY-kinases was established to design the SCMBYK predictor, which achieved training and test accuracies of 97.55 and 96.73%, respectively. Furthermore, the leave-one-phylum-out method was used to predict specific bacterial phyla hosts of target sequences, gaining 97.39% average test accuracy. After analyzing SCMBYK-derived propensity scores, four characteristics of BY-kinases were determined: 1) BY-kinases tend to be composed of α-helices; 2) the amino-acid content of extracellular regions of BY-kinases is expected to be dominated by residues such as Val, , Phe and ; 3) BY-kinases structurally resemble nuclear proteins; 4) different domains play different roles in triggering BY-kinase activity.The SCMBYK predictor is an effective method for identification of possible BY-kinases. Furthermore, it can be used as a part of a novel drug repurposing method, which recognizes putative BY-kinases and matches them to approved drugs. Among other results, our analysis revealed that azathioprine could suppress the virulence of M. tuberculosis, and thus be considered as a potential antibiotic for tuberculosis treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25477187>Utilisation of the isobole methodology to study dietary peptide-drug and peptide-peptide interactive effects on dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibition.</a></h2><p>Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is used as a means to regulate post-prandial serum glucose in type 2 diabetics. The effect of drug (Sitagliptin®)/peptide and binary peptide mixtures on DPP-IV inhibition was studied using an isobole approach. Five peptides (-Pro--Gln-, Trp-Lys, Trp-Pro, Trp-Arg and Trp-Leu), having DPP-IV half maximum inhibitory concentration values (IC₅₀)<60 μM and reported to act through different inhibition mechanisms, were investigated. The dose response relationship of Sitagliptin : peptide (1:0, 0:1, 1:852, 1:426 and 1:1704 on a molar basis) and binary -Pro--Gln- : peptide (1:0, 0:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1 on a molar basis) mixtures for DPP-IV inhibition was characterised. Isobolographic analysis showed, in most instances, an additive effect on DPP-IV inhibition. However, a synergistic effect was observed with two Sitagliptin:-Pro--Gln- (1:426 and 1:852) mixtures and an antagonistic effect was seen with one Sitagliptin : Trp-Pro (1:852) mixture, and three binary peptide mixtures (-Pro--Gln- : Trp-Lys (1:1 and 2:1) and -Pro--Gln-:Trp-Leu (1:2)). The results show that Sitagliptin and food protein-derived peptides can interact, thereby enhancing overall DPP-IV inhibition.

The structure of the NpTrpDH monomer, which exhibited high similarity to that of l-Glu/l-Leu/l-Phe dehydrogenases, consisted of a substrate-binding domain (domain I, residues 3 to 133 and 328 to 343) and an NAD/NADH-binding domain (domain II, residues 142 to 327) separated by a deep cleft. The apo-NpTrpDH existed in an open conformation, where domains I and II were apart from each other. The subunits dimerized themselves mainly through interactions between amino acid residues around the β-1 strand of each subunit, as was observed in the case of l-Phe dehydrogenase. The binding site for the substrate l-Trp was predicted by a molecular docking simulation and validated by site-directed mutagenesis. Several hydrophobic residues, which were located in the active site of NpTrpDH and possibly interacted with the side chain of the substrate l-Trp, were arranged similarly to that found in l-Leu/l-Phe dehydrogenases but fairly different from that of an l-Glu dehydrogenase. Our crystal structure revealed that Met-40, Ala-69, -74, -110, Leu-288, -289, and -292 formed a hydrophobic cluster around the active site. The results of the site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggested that the hydrophobic cluster plays critical roles in protein folding, l-Trp recognition, and catalysis. Our results provide critical information for further characterization and engineering of this enzyme.In this study, we determined the three-dimensional structure of l-Trp dehydrogenase, analyzed its various site-directed substitution mutants at residues located in the active site, and obtained the following informative results. Several residues in the active site form a hydrophobic cluster, which may be a part of the hydrophobic core essential for protein folding. To our knowledge, there is no previous report demonstrating that a hydrophobic cluster in the active site of any l-amino acid dehydrogenase may have a critical impact on protein folding. Furthermore, our results suggest that this hydrophobic cluster could strictly accommodate l-Trp. These studies show the structural characteristics of l-Trp dehydrogenase and hence would facilitate novel applications of l-Trp dehydrogenase.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25595103>Computational identification and binding analysis of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 enzyme with substrates.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are important heme-containing proteins, well known for their monooxygenase reaction. The human cytochrome P450 4X1 (CYP4X1) is categorized as "orphan" CYP because of its unknown function. In recent studies it is found that this enzyme is expressed in neurovascular functions of the brain. Also, various studies have found the expression and activity of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 in cancer. It is found to be a potential drug target for cancer therapy. However, three-dimensional structure, the active site topology and substrate specificity of CYP4X1 remain unclear.In the present study, the three-dimensional structure of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated by homology modeling using Modeller 9v8. The generated structure was accessed for geometrical errors and energy stability using PROCHECK, VERFIY 3D and PROSA. A molecular docking analysis was carried out against substrates arachidonic acid and anandamide and the docked substrates were predicted for drug-likeness, ADME-Tox parameters and biological spectrum activity.The three-dimensional model of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated and assessed with various structural validation programmes. Docking of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 with arachidonic acid revealed that  112, ALA 126,  222,  223, THR 312, LEU 315, ALA 316, ASP 319, THR 320, PHE 491 and  492 residues were actively participating in the interaction, while docking of CYP4X1 with anandamide showed that  112, GLN 114, PRO 118, ALA 126,  222,  223, SER 251, LEU 315, ALA 316 and PHE 491 key residues were involved in strong interaction.From this study, several key residues were identified to be responsible for the binding of arachidonic acid and anandamide with orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1. Both substrates obeyed Lipinski rule of five in drug-likeness test and biological spectrum prediction showed anticarcinogenic activity. Compared to anandamide, arachidonic acid showed strong interaction with cytochrome P450 4X1 and also less health effect in certain human system in ADME-Tox prediction.

Ala-based tetra- and pentapeptides were designed, and the N- or C-terminal amino acid residues were replaced by different amino acids. The results showed that the oligopeptides had a wide range of transport permeability across the Caco-2 cell monolayer and could be divided into four categories: non-/poor permeability, low permeability, intermediate permeability, and good permeability. Tetrapeptides with N-terminal Leu, Pro, , Cys, Met, and Val or C-terminal Val showed the highest permeability, with apparent permeability coefficient (P) values over 10 × 10 cm/s (p < 0.05), suggesting that nonpolar hydrophobic aliphatic amino acids or polar sulfur-containing amino acids were the best for the transport of tetrapeptides. Pentapeptides with N- or C-terminal  also showed high permeability levels, with P values of about 10 × 10 cm/s. The amino acids Glu, Asn, and Thr at the N terminus or Lys, Asp, and Arg at the C terminus were also beneficial for the transport of tetra- and pentapeptides, with P values ranging from 1 × 10 to 10 × 10 cm/s. In addition, peptides with amino acids replaced at the N terminus generally showed higher permeability than those with amino acids replaced at the C terminus (p < 0.05), suggesting that N-terminal amino acids were more important for the transport of oligopeptides across the Caco-2 cell monolayer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28342601>Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry MS-based untargeted milk metabolomics in dairy cows with subclinical or clinical mastitis.</a></h2><p>In this study, a novel metabolomics technique based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry in the MS mode was used to investigate the milk metabolomics of healthy, subclinical, and clinical mastitis cows, which were classified based on somatic cell count and presentation of clinical symptoms. Meanwhile, univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to identify the significant differences across the 3 groups. Compared with healthy milk samples, less glucose, d-glycerol-1-phosphate, 4-hydroxyphenyllactate, l-carnitine, sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, citrate, and hippurate were detected in the clinical mastitic milk samples, whereas less d-glycerol-1-phosphate, benzoic acid, l-carnitine, and cis-aconitate were found in the subclinical mastitic milk samples. Meanwhile, the milk concentration of arginine and Leu-Leu increased in both the clinical and subclinical mastitis groups. Besides, less 4-hydroxyphenyllactate, cis-aconitate, lactose, and oxoglutarate were detected in the clinical than the subclinical mastitic milk samples, whereas the abundance of some oligopeptides (Leu-Ala, Phe-Pro-, Asn-Arg-Ala-, and Val-Phe-Val-) increased by over 7.95-fold. Our results suggest that significant variations exist across healthy and mastitis cows.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of nerve damage and sensory loss remain largely unclear. Recently, alteration in  flux has gained attention as a basis for organ damage in diabetes; however, peripheral sensory neurons have not been adequately analyzed with respect to  dysfunction. In the present study, we attempted to delineate the sequence of event occurring in alteration of   in relation to nerve damage and sensory loss. C57Bl6/j wild-type mice were analyzed longitudinally up to 22 weeks in the streptozotocin (STZ) model of type 1 diabetes. The progression of DPN was investigated by behavioral measurements of sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli and quantitative morphological assessment of intraepidermal nerve fiber density. We employed a mass spectrometry-based screen to address alterations in levels of metabolites in peripheral sciatic nerve and amino acids in serum over several months post-STZ administration to elucidate  dysfunction longitudinally in relation to sensory dysfunction. Although hyperglycemia and body weight changes occurred early, sensory loss and reduced intraepithelial branching of nociceptive nerves were only evident at 22 weeks post-STZ. The longitudinal metabolites screen in peripheral nerves demonstrated that compared with buffer-injected age-matched control mice, mice at 12 and 22 weeks post-STZ showed an early impairment the tricaoboxylic acid (TCA cycle), which is the main pathway of carbohydrate  leading to energy generation. We found that levels of citric acid, ketoglutaric acid (2 KG), succinic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid were observed to be significantly reduced in sciatic nerve at 22 weeks post-STZ. In addition, we also found the increase in levels of sorbitol and L-lactate in peripheral nerve from 12 weeks post-STZ injection. Amino acid screen in serum showed that the amino acids valine (Val), isoleucine (), and leucine (Leu), grouped together as BCAA, increased more than twofold from 12 weeks post-STZ. Similarly, the levels of tyrosine (), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), histidine (His), alanine (Ala), and proline (Pro) showed progressive increase with progression of diabetes. Our results indicate that the impaired TCA cycle metabolites in peripheral nerve are the primary cause of shunting  substrate to compensatory , which leads to sensory nerve fiber loss in skin and contribute to onset and progression of peripheral neuropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29428186>Laminin peptide YIGSR enhances epidermal development of skin equivalents.</a></h2><p>Since the use of animal experimentation is restricted with regard to cosmetic materials, alternative in vitro models such as skin equivalents (SEs) are needed. Laminin is one of the major non-collagenous glycoproteins. The pentapeptide YIGSR (--Gly-Ser-Arg) is a functional motif of laminin that binds to the laminin receptor. In the present study, we examined whether YIGSR could improve the reconstruction of SEs. YIGSR has no effects on monolayer cell proliferation of CCD25-Sk fibroblasts or HaCaT keratinocytes. Interestingly, YIGSR decreased TGF-β1 levels, although it promoted type Ι collagen synthesis in CCD25-Sk cells. In HaCaT cells, YIGSR decreased the expression of involucrin and loricrin, which are differentiation markers. Furthermore, YIGSR increased levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), p63, and integrin α6, and decreased involucrin in SE models. In addition, two models containing YIGSR (mixed with dermal equivalents or added into media) did not show any differences in expression levels of PCNA, p63, integrin α6, and involucrin. Therefore, YIGSR is a useful agent for reconstruction of SEs, independent of its method of application. These results indicate that YIGSR stimulates epidermal proliferation and basement membrane formation while inhibiting keratinocyte differentiation of SEs. Taken together, these results indicate that YIGSR promotes the reconstruction of SEs, potentially via decreased TGF-β1 levels and consequent inhibition of epidermal differentiation.Copyright © 2018 Tissue Viability Society.

However, due to the acute thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia, long-term failure of synthetic grafts after implanted in small diameter blood vessel decelerates its commercial use. The continued acute inflammation and delayed endothelialization have been considered as fundamental reasons. To enhance the adhesion and organization of endothelial cells (ECs) and improve the vascular remodeling process, we have constructed a vascular graft based on electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) matrix, on which organoselenium-immobilized polyethyleneimine (SePEI) for in situ nitric oxide (NO) generation and hyaluronic acid (HA) grafted with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) modified --Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR) for antifouling and EC adhesion were deposited through electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly. The in vitro results showed that SePEI deposited on the grafts could catalyze stable generation of NO. After in situ implantation in rats for 4 and 8weeks, the graft promoted the transformation of macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2), which helped endothelium remodeling. YIGSR on the outmost layer facilitated more rapid and organized EC adhesion compared to PCL and non-modified grafts. PEG polymer chain on the outmost layer mitigated nonspecific adsorption of undesirable blood components. In our study, we first demonstrated the regulation of macrophage polarization by an NO-generating vascular graft. The results indicated that the approach of anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization and enhanced endothelialization through NO generation and PEG-modified YIGSR in our study may provide a new perspective for the clinic application of cell-free small-diameter vascular grafts.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The study used a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement with 2 grains (sorghum or wheat) and 4 diets: positive control (no enzyme and ME, digestible Lys, Ca, and P sufficient, negative control (NC; no enzyme and reduced ME [-100 kcal/kg], digestible AA [-2%], Ca [-0.12 percentage points], and available P [-0.18 percentage points in the starter phase and -0.22 percentage points in the grower phase]), NC + nonstarch polysaccharide-degrading enzymes + phytase (500 phytase units [FTU]; NCCP), and NC + phytase (1,000 FTU; NCP). From 0 to 35 d, birds fed wheat-based diets had greater G:F (4.5%), BW gain (9.2%), breast meat yield (6.8%), and tibia ash (2.0%) compared with birds fed sorghum-based diets. Across grain types, the NCCP treatment improved BW gain ( < 0.001), feed intake ( < 0.001), G:F ( < 0.05), and livability ( < 0.001) compared with the NC treatment. Birds fed NCP had greater BW gain ( < 0.001), feed intake ( < 0.001), G:F ( < 0.001), and livability ( < 0.001) compared with birds fed NC. Birds fed the NCP diet had greater BW gain ( < 0.001), toe ash ( < 0.01), and tibia ash ( < 0.001) compared with birds fed the NCCP diet. There was a grain × diet interaction for feed intake ( < 0.01), BW gain ( < 0.001), tibia ash ( < 0.01), and tibia breaking strength ( < 0.05). The influence of enzymes was more pronounced in sorghum-based diets than in wheat-based diets. Birds fed wheat-based diets had greater ileal digestibility of His, Met, Val, Phe, , Leu, Trp, Glu, Pro, Ala, , and Cys compared with those fed sorghum-based diets ( < 0.05). Across grain types, NCP had greater apparent ileal digestibility of Met, Lys, Ser, Pro, Gly, and Cys than NC ( < 0.05). The results suggest that wheat is superior to sorghum for broilers, as expected, but that enzyme supplementation has the capability to restore the compromised bird performance due to feeding sorghum. In addition, compared with nonstarch polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and phytase (500 FTU/kg feed) added in concert, phytase supplemented at 1,000 FTU/kg resulted in a further improvement of some of the performance and bone mineralization parameters in male broilers fed sorghum-based diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26920059>Chameleon sequences in neurodegenerative diseases.</a></h2><p>Chameleon sequences can adopt either alpha helix sheet or a coil conformation. Defining chameleon sequences in PDB (Protein Data Bank) may yield to an insight on defining peptides and proteins responsible in neurodegeneration. In this research, we benefitted from the large PDB and performed a sequence analysis on Chameleons, where we developed an algorithm to extract peptide segments with identical sequences, but different structures. In order to find new chameleon sequences, we extracted a set of 8315 non-redundant protein sequences from the PDB with an identity less than 25%. Our data was classified to "helix to strand (HE)", "helix to coil (HC)" and "strand to coil (CE)" alterations. We also analyzed the occurrence of singlet and doublet amino acids and the solvent accessibility in the chameleon sequences; we then sorted out the proteins with the most number of chameleon sequences and named them Chameleon Flexible Proteins (CFPs) in our dataset. Our data revealed that Gly, Val, ,  and Phe, are the major amino acids in Chameleons. We also found that there are proteins such as Insulin Degrading Enzyme IDE and GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran (RAN) with the most number of chameleons (640 and 405 respectively). These proteins have known roles in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore it can be inferred that other CFP's can serve as key proteins in neurodegeneration, and a study on them can shed light on curing and preventing neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It is also up-regulated in cancer cells, as part of a tumor's increased  demands. Previously, amino acid prodrugs have been shown to be transported by LAT1. Carboxylic acid bioisosteres may afford prodrugs with an altered physicochemical and pharmacokinetic profile than those derived from natural amino acids, allowing for higher brain or tumor levels of drug and/or lower toxicity. The effect of replacing phenylalanine's carboxylic acid with a tetrazole, acylsulfonamide and hydroxamic acid (HA) bioisostere was examined. Compounds were tested for their ability to be LAT1 substrates using both cis-inhibition and trans-stimulation cell assays. As HA-Phe demonstrated weak substrate activity, its structure-activity relationship (SAR) was further explored by synthesis and testing of HA derivatives of other LAT1 amino acid substrates (i.e., , Leu, , and Met). The potential for a false positive in the trans-stimulation assay caused by parent amino acid was evaluated by conducting compound stability experiments for both HA-Leu and the corresponding methyl ester derivative. We concluded that HA's are transported by LAT1. In addition, our results lend support to a recent account that amino acid esters are LAT1 substrates, and that hydrogen bonding may be as important as charge for interaction with the transporter binding site.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Eutherian mammals possess a highly conserved sequence of OXT (Cys---Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Leu-Gly). However, in this study, we sequenced the coding region for OXT in 22 species covering all New World monkeys (NWM) genera and clades, and characterize five OXT variants, including consensus mammalian Leu(8)-OXT, major variant Pro(8)-OXT, and three previously unreported variants: Ala(8)-OXT, Thr(8)-OXT, and Phe(2)-OXT. Pro(8)-OXT shows clear structural and physicochemical differences from Leu(8)-OXT. We report multiple predicted amino acid substitutions in the G protein-coupled OXT receptor (OXTR), especially in the critical N-terminus, which is crucial for OXT recognition and binding. Genera with same Pro(8)-OXT tend to cluster together on a phylogenetic tree based on OXTR sequence, and we demonstrate significant coevolution between OXT and OXTR. NWM species are characterized by high incidence of social monogamy, and we document an association between OXTR phylogeny and social monogamy. Our results demonstrate remarkable genetic diversity in the NWM OXT/OXTR system, which can provide a foundation for molecular, pharmacological, and behavioral studies of the role of OXT signaling in regulating complex social phenotypes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28046184>Nutritive value of extruded or multi-enzyme supplemented cold-pressed soybean cake for pigs.</a></h2><p>The objectives were to determine the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of AA and NE value of cold-pressed soybean cake (CP-SBC), and the effect of extrusion or adding multi-enzyme to CP-SBC diet for growing pigs. Eight ileal-cannulated pigs (initial BW = 79.7 ± 3.97 kg) were fed 4 diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design to give 8 replicates per diet. Diets included a cornstarch-based diet with CP-SBC, extruded CP-SBC, and SBC plus multi-enzyme (1,200 U of xylanase, 150 U of glucanase, 500 U of cellulase, 60 U of mannanase, 700 U of invertase, 5,000 U of protease, and 12,000 U of amylase/kilogram of diet; Superzyme-CS, 0.5 g/kg); and a N-free diet. The CP-SBC was the sole source of protein in the CP-SBC-containing diets. The ratio of cornstarch to sugar and soybean oil in CP-SBC-containing diets was identical to the N-free diet to allow calculation of energy digestibility of CP-SBC by the difference method. The evaluated CP-SBC had been produced by heating the soybean seed at 105°C for 60 min followed by pressing of the heated soybean seeds at less than 42°C (barrel temperature). On a DM basis, CP-SBC and extruded CP-SBC contained 47.8 and 47.1% CP, 15.6 and 10.5% ADF, 7.23 and 8.85% ether extract, 3.11 and 3.08% Lys, and 2.25 and 3.70 trypsin inhibitor units per mg, respectively. Extrusion increased ( < 0.001) the SID of AA for the CP-SBC by an average of 12%. Also, extrusion increased ( < 0.001) the NE value of the CP-SBC from 2,743 to 2,853 kcal/kg of DM. Supplementation of CP-SBC diet with the multi-enzyme increased ( < 0.05) the SID of Arg and Pro, and tended to increase ( < 0.1) the SID of  and . However, the multi-enzyme supplementation did not affect the NE value of CP-SBC. In conclusion, the CP-SBC evaluated in the present study could be an alternative source of AA and energy in swine diets, and its nutritive value can be increased by extrusion following cold-pressing. The multi-enzyme used in this study improved the digestibility of some AA, but had limited effect on energy digestibility and hence NE value of the CP-SBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27572445>Host SHP1 phosphatase antagonizes Helicobacter pylori CagA and can be downregulated by Epstein-Barr virus.</a></h2><p>Most if not all gastric cancers are associated with chronic infection of the stomach mucosa with Helicobacter pylori cagA-positive strains(1-4). Approximately 10% of gastric cancers also harbour Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the cancer cells(5,6). Following delivery into gastric epithelial cells via type IV secretion(7,8), the cagA-encoded CagA protein undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation on the Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA) motifs initially by Src family kinases (SFKs) and then by c-Abl(9,10). Tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA binds to the pro-oncogenic protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and thereby deregulates the phosphatase activity(11,12), which has been considered to play an important role in gastric carcinogenesis(13). Here we show that the SHP2 homologue SHP1 interacts with CagA independently of the EPIYA motif. The interaction potentiates the phosphatase activity of SHP1 that dampens the oncogenic action of CagA by dephosphorylating the CagA EPIYA motifs. In vitro infection of gastric epithelial cells with EBV induces SHP1 promoter hypermethylation, which strengthens phosphorylation-dependent CagA action via epigenetic downregulation of SHP1 expression. Clinical specimens of EBV-positive gastric cancers also exhibit SHP1 hypermethylation with reduced SHP1 expression. The results reveal that SHP1 is the long-sought phosphatase that can antagonize CagA. Augmented H. pylori CagA activity, via SHP1 inhibition, might also contribute to the development of EBV-positive gastric cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29989088>Identification of Inhibitors of MMPS Enzymes via a Novel Computational Approach.</a></h2><p>Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent proteinases that play complex and diverse roles in , which are vital for physiological development. In this paper, we present a novel method to identify peptide binding to seven matrix metalloproteases. First, we propose a novel sampling criteria for constructing a training set for each new peptide motif. Then, we select nine physicochemical properties of amino acids and compute their auto-cross covariance to effectively extract features for both natural and non-natural amino acids. Finally, we adopt random forest to predict binding values of each peptide motif respectively with seven MMPs. Our method verifies on 1300 known peptide motifs binding to seven MMPs and achieved preeminent Pearson-product-moment correlation coefficient (PCC) and root mean squared error (RMSE) on all seven MMPs, especially of 0.9181 and 9.3827 on MMP-7. We predict binding values of 4000 peptide motifs and identify peptides preferentially bind to MMP-2 and MMP-7. We herein report 4 novel inhibitor candidates of Asp--Phe, Asp--, Asp--Lys and Hser-Gly-Phe with high potency and selectivity binding to MMP-2, as well as 6 novel inhibitor candidates of Chg--, Chg--Leu, Chg--Glu, Chg--Met, Chg-Val- and Chg-Val-Leu selectively binding to MMP-7. Our findings facilitate the identification of inhibitors with good potency as well as desirable selectivity, providing significant insights of candidate inhibitor drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25844930>Synthesis and pharmacology of halogenated δ-opioid-selective [d-Ala(2)]deltorphin II peptide analogues.</a></h2><p>Deltorphins are naturally occurring peptides produced by the skin of the giant monkey frog (Phyllomedusa bicolor). They are δ-opioid receptor-selective agonists. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a peptide, -d-Ala-(pI)Phe-Glu---Gly-NH2 3 (GATE3-8), based on the [d-Ala(2)]deltorphin II template, which is δ-selective in in vitro radioligand binding assays over the μ- and κ-opioid receptors. It is a full agonist in [(35)S]GTPγS functional assays and analgesic when administered supraspinally to mice. Analgesia of 3 (GATE3-8) is blocked by the selective δ receptor antagonist naltrindole, indicating that the analgesic action of 3 is mediated by the δ-opioid receptor. We have established a radioligand in which (125)I is incorporated into 3 (GATE3-8). The radioligand has a KD of 0.1 nM in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the δ receptor. Additionally, a series of peptides based on 3 (GATE3-8) was synthesized by incorporating various halogens in the para position on the aromatic ring of Phe(3). The peptides were characterized for binding affinity at the μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors, which showed a linear correlation between binding affinity and the size of the halogen substituent. These peptides may be interesting tools for probing δ-opioid receptor pharmacology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27591418>Quantification of peptides using N-terminal isotope coding and C-terminal derivatization for sensitive analysis by micro liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Stable isotope-coding coupled with mass spectrometry is a popular method for quantitative proteomics and peptide quantification. However, the efficiency of the derivatization reaction at a particular functional group, especially in complex structures, can affect accuracy. Here, we present a dual functional-group derivatization of bioactive peptides followed by micro liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). By separating the sensitivity-enhancement and isotope-coding derivatization reactions, suitable chemistries can be chosen. The peptide amino groups were reductively alkylated with acetaldehyde or acetaldehyde-d to afford N-alkylated products with different masses. This process is simple, quick and high-yield, and accurate comparative analysis can be achieved for the mass-differentiated peptides. Then, the carboxyl groups were derivatized with 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine to increase MS/MS sensitivity. Angiotensins I-IV, bradykinin and neurotensin were analyzed after online solid phase extraction by micro LC-MS/MS. In all instances, a greater than 17-fold increase in sensitivity was achieved, compared with the analyses of the underivatized peptides. Furthermore, the values obtained from the present method were in agreement with the result from isotope dilution quantification using isotopically labeled angiotensin I [Asp-Arg-(Val-d )---His-Pro-(Phe-d )-His-Leu].Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29941456>Mechanism of premature translation termination on a sense codon.</a></h2><p>Accurate translation termination by release factors (RFs) is critical for the integrity of cellular proteomes. Premature termination on sense codons, for example, results in truncated proteins, whose accumulation could be detrimental to the cell. Nevertheless, some sense codons are prone to triggering premature termination, but the structural basis for this is unclear. To investigate premature termination, we determined a cryo-EM structure of the  70S ribosome bound with RF1 in response to a UAU () sense codon. The structure reveals that RF1 recognizes a UAU codon similarly to a UAG stop codon, suggesting that sense codons induce premature termination because they structurally mimic a stop codon. Hydrophobic interaction between the nucleobase of U3 (the third position of the UAU codon) and conserved -196 in RF1 is important for misreading the UAU codon. Analyses of RNA binding in ribonucleoprotein complexes or by amino acids reveal that -U packing is a frequent protein-RNA-binding motif with key functional implications. We discuss parallels with eukaryotic translation termination by the release factor eRF1.© 2018 Svidritskiy et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27064538>Hyperactive Editing Domain Variants Switch the Stereospecificity of Tyrosyl-tRNA Synthetase.</a></h2><p>d-Amino acids are excluded at three different steps during protein synthesis: the aminoacylation of tRNA, binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs to EF-Tu, and selection of the aminoacyl-tRNA by the ribosome. We previously altered the enantioselectivity of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) by inserting the editing domain from phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (FRSed) between Gly 161 and  162 in tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (the editing domain hydrolyzes l--tRNA but not d--tRNA). In this paper, we test the hypothesis that the enantioselectivity of this TyrRS-FRSed chimera can be shifted further toward the formation of d--tRNA by introducing activating mutations into the editing site. Yokoyama and colleagues previously identified six alanine substitutions in phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase that increase its editing activity.1 We have introduced these alanine substitutions into TyrRS-FRSed in various combinations, generating 14 different variants. To analyze their editing activity, we developed a continuous, spectrophotometric, steady-state post-transfer editing assay in which l--tRNA is generated in situ, resulting in the release of one molecule of AMP during each editing cycle. Post-transfer editing is monitored by coupling the release of AMP to the reduction of NAD(+) (via the actions of AMP deaminase and IMP dehydrogenase), resulting in an increase in absorbance at 340 nm. In general, TyrRS-FRSed variants containing two activating mutations are the most active, with additional alanine substitutions decreasing the activity of the editing domain. Linear free energy relationships indicate that high kcat values are correlated with high binding affinities for l--tRNA. Lastly, competition assays indicate that at least one TyrRS-FRSed variant (F145A/S211A) preferentially aminoacylates tRNA with d-tyrosine, demonstrating that the enantioselectivity of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase can be inverted using hyperactive editing domains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29606463>Know your fish: A novel compound-specific isotope approach for tracing wild and farmed salmon.</a></h2><p>The rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry with carnivorous fish such as salmon has been accompanied by an equally rapid development in alternative feed ingredients. This has outpaced the ability of prevailing authentication method to trace the diet and origins of salmon products at the retail end. To close this gap, we developed a new profiling tool based on amino acid δC fingerprints. With this tool, we discriminated with high-accuracy among wild-caught, organically, and conventionally farmed salmon groups, as well as salmon fed alternative diets such as insects and macroalgae. Substitution of fishmeal with macroalgae was detected at 5% difference level. The δC fingerprints of essential amino acids appear particularly well suited for tracing protein sources, and the non-essentials for tracing lipid origins (terrestrial vs. aquatic). In an industry constantly developing new feed proteins and functional additives, our method is a promising tool for tracing salmon and other seafood products.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

One-day-old broiler chickens (n = 480) were randomly allocated to 4 treatments with 6 replicates of 20 chicks each for diets containing YCW at 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g/kg. The results showed that YCW supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ADFI and ADG by 15.3% and 16.0%, respectively, and the 2 higher doses of YCW had greater effects (P < 0.05) than the lower dose. For the glutathione pathway in the duodenal mucosa, the levels of reduced glutathione and glutathione reductase in the YCW treatments were increased (P < 0.05) by 15.6% and 17.4%, respectively, but glutathione S-transferases was not affected. Similarly, the YCW increased (P < 0.05) the mucosal activities of trypsin, dipeptidyl, and leucine aminopeptidase by 12.4%, 5.5%, and 17.3%, respectively, and the mRNA profiles of neutral, cationic, and oligopeptide transporters by 62.5%, 69.1%, and 11.5%, respectively. The YCW also increased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of Thr, Met, , Leu, Lys, Arg, and  in the blood by 8.8% to 39.2%. Additionally, the ADFI, ADG, reduced glutathione, trypsin, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, leucine aminopeptidase, and cationic amino acid transporter increased linearly and quadratically (P < 0.05) with YCW supplementation. The results suggest that YCW supplementation can beneficially modulate intestinal glutathione pathway, proteolytic enzyme activity, and nutrient transport in growing animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25937370>Small-molecule-driven hepatocyte differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells.</a></h2><p>The differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to hepatocytes is well established, yet current methods suffer from several drawbacks. These include a lack of definition and reproducibility, which in part stems from continued reliance on recombinant growth factors. This has remained a stumbling block for the translation of the technology into industry and the clinic for reasons associated with cost and quality. We have devised a growth-factor-free protocol that relies on small molecules to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells toward a hepatic phenotype. The procedure can efficiently direct both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells to hepatocyte-like cells. The final population of cells demonstrates marker expression at the transcriptional and protein levels, as well as key hepatic functions such as serum protein production, glycogen storage, and cytochrome P450 activity.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells via bacterial type IV secretion, CagA interacts with a number of host proteins through the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail, which contains two repeatable protein-binding motifs, the Glu-Pro---Ala (EPIYA) motif and the CagA multimerization (CM) motif. The EPIYA motif, upon phosphorylation by host kinases, binds and deregulates Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), a  oncoprotein, inducing pro-oncogenic mitogenic signaling and abnormal cell morphology. Through the CM motif, CagA inhibits the kinase activity of polarity regulator partitioning-defective 1b (PAR1b), causing junctional and polarity defects while inducing actin cytoskeletal rearrangements. The magnitude of the pathobiological action of individual CagA has been linked to the tandem repeat polymorphisms of these two binding motifs, yet the molecular mechanisms by which they affect disease outcome remain unclear. Recent studies using quantitative techniques have provided new insights into how the sequence polymorphisms in the structurally disordered C-terminal region determine the degree of pro-oncogenic action of CagA in the gastric epithelium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27704848>Nontargeted LC-MS Metabolomics Approach for  Profiling of Plasma and Urine from Pigs Fed Branched Chain Amino Acids for Maximum Growth Performance.</a></h2><p>The  response in plasma and urine of pigs when feeding an optimum level of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) for best growth performance is unknown. The objective of the current study was to identify the  phenotype associated with the BCAAs intake level that could be linked to the animal growth performance. Three dose-response studies were carried out to collect blood and urine samples from pigs fed increasing levels of , Val, or Leu followed by a nontargeted LC-MS approach to characterize the  profile of biofluids when dietary BCAAs are optimum for animal growth. Results showed that concentrations of plasma hypoxanthine and tyrosine () were higher while concentrations of glycocholic acid, tauroursodeoxycholic acid, and taurocholic acid were lower when the dietary  was optimum. Plasma 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid and creatine were lower when dietary Leu was optimum. The optimum dietary Leu resulted in increased urinary excretion of ascorbic acid and choline and relatively decreased excretion of 2-aminoadipic acid, acetyl-dl-valine, , 2-methylbutyrylglycine, and . In conclusion, plasma glycocholic acid and taurocholic acid were discriminating metabolites to the optimum dietary . The optimum dietary Leu was associated with reduced plasma creatine and urinary 2-aminoadipic acid and elevated urinary excretion of ascorbic acid and choline.

There are an estimated 5 million diagnosed AD patients in the U.S. and 16 million worldwide with no adequate treatment presently available. New therapeutic approaches are needed to slow, and hopefully reverse, disease progression. This review summarizes available information regarding an overlooked therapeutic target that may offer a treatment to slow and hopefully halt AD, namely the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met receptor system. Activation of the c-Met receptor stimulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, morphogenesis, the ability to mediate stem cell differentiation and neurogenesis, and protects against tissue insults in a wide range of cells including neurons. This growth factor system has recently been shown to induce dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis when stimulated by a newly developed angiotensin-based analogue, N-hexanoic---(6) amino hexanoic amide (Dihexa). This small molecule was derived from the pre-prototype molecule Nle1-angiotensin IV and has shown promise in facilitating the formation of new functional synaptic connections and augmenting memory consolidation in animal models of AD. Dihexa is a first-in-class compound that is orally active, penetrates the blood-brain barrier, and facilitates memory consolidation and retrieval. This angiotensin-based small molecule may be efficacious as a treatment for AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849491>Synthesis of N-Chloroamino Acids and Their Biological Activities in LPS Stimulated RAW 264.7 Cells.</a></h2><p>Amino acids (AAs) are essential for protein synthesis, neurotransmission and macro molecule biosynthesis. Ala, Gln, Gly, Lys, Val and taurine (Tau) are the most abundant free AAs in mammals, and some of these react with hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl) produced by myeloperoxidase in activated phagocytes to form N-chloroamino acids (NCAA). In this study, we reacted 20 AAs and Tau with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then classified the products into five types (I-V) based on the change in their absorbance. Type I AAs (Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, , Lys, Phe, Ser, Tau, Thr and Val) generated a typical monochloramine peak at 252 nm, while Type II AAs (Asn and ) and Type III AAs (Glu and Leu) produced peaks at 275 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The Type IV AAs (His, Met and Trp) did not show any distinct absorption peak, and Type V AAs (Asp, Cys and Pro) did not appear to react with NaOCl. The ArgCl and TauCl were stable, while GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, PheCl and ValCl were less stable and AlaCl, SerCl and ThrCl were the least stable. Tau is the most abundant non-proteinogenic free AA in cellular fluid and has many physiological functions in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal and immune systems. Tau reacts with HOCl to form TauCl, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators such as superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukins, while increasing the antioxidant proteins in macrophages. We determined the effects of Type I NCAA on cell viability, NO and TNF-α production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. All Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited LPS-induced NO production. However, only GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, SerCl and TauCl inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production. In summary, Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited NO production, while their effects on TNF-α varied. Our results suggest that Type I NCAA may serve as biological regulators similar to TauCl during inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26100395>Characterization of Novel Fusaricidins Produced by Paenibacillus polymyxa-M1 Using MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Paenibacillus polymyxa-M1 is a potent producer of bioactive compounds, such as lipopeptides, polyketides, and lantibiotics of biotechnological and medical interest. Genome sequencing revealed nine gene clusters for nonribosomal biosynthesis of such agents. Here we report on the investigation of the fusaricidins, a complex of cyclic lipopeptides containing 15-guanidino-3-hydroxypentadecanoic acid (GHPD) as fatty acid component by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). More than 20 variants of these compounds were detected and characterized in detail. Mass spectrometric sequence analysis was performed by MALDI-LIFT-TOF/TOF fragment analysis. The obtained product ion spectra show a specific processing in the fatty acid part. GHPD is cleaved between the α- and ß-position yielding two fragments a and b, one bearing the end-standing guanidine group and another one comprising the residual two C-atoms of GHPD with the attached peptide moiety. The complete sequence of all fusaricidins was derived from sets of bn- and yn-ions. The fusaricidin complex can be divided into four lipopeptide families, three of them showing variations of the amino acid in position 3, Val or  for the first and  or Phe for families 2 and 3, respectively. A collection of novel fusaricidins was detected differing from those of families 1-3 by an additional residue of 71 Da (family 4). LIFT-TOF/TOF fragment spectra of these species imply that in their peptide moiety, an Ala-residue is attached by an ester bond to the free hydroxyl group of Thr4.

In this study, two multi-functional peptides, YSQLENEFDR (-Ser-Gln-Leu-Glu-Asn-Glu-Phe-Asp-Arg) and YIAEDAER (--Ala-Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Arg), were isolated and purified from meat and visceral mass extracts of  using a multi-bioassay-guided method and were characterized by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Both peptides showed high antioxidant, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory, and anti-diabetic activities, with half-maximal effective concentrations values less than 1 mM. Antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities were significantly higher for YSQLENEFDR than for YIAEDAER. In a zebrafish model, the two peptides exhibited strong scavenging ability for reactive oxygen species and effectively protected skin cells against oxidative damage without toxicity. Molecular docking simulation further predicted the interactions of the two peptides and ACE. Stability analysis study indicated that the two synthetic peptides maintained their activities under thermal stress and simulated gastrointestinal digestion conditions. The low molecular weight, high proportion of hydrophobic and negatively-charged amino acids, and specific C-terminal and N-terminal amino acids may contribute to the observed bio-activities of these two peptides with potential application for the prevention of chronic noncommunicable diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755932>Relationships between postruminal casein infusion and milk production, and concentrations of plasma amino acids and blood urea in dairy cows: A multilevel mixed-effects meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>The relationships between postruminal casein infusion and production variables and concentrations of plasma AA and blood urea were evaluated using multilevel mixed-effects models derived from literature data collected in dairy cows. The data set contained 147 treatment means [i.e., 66 controls (CTL) and 81 casein-infused (CAS) means]. Each CAS mean was paired with its corresponding CTL mean to create 81 mean differences (CAS minus CTL), which were analyzed as absolute and percentage-based units (i.e., percentage increase or decrease in CAS relative to CTL). The primary variable of interest was the difference in estimated metabolizable protein (MP) supply (ΔMP) between CAS and CTL. The other explanatory variables were based on levels in CTL: MP supply, MP balance, the ratio of duodenal microbial protein (MCP) to MP supply (MCPMP), the stage of lactation (early or mid/late) and the type of forage (grass/legume- or corn silage-based). The MP supply and MP balance influenced negatively the relationship between ΔMP and the response of true protein yield. Responses of milk urea, blood urea, and plasma urea cycle AA concentrations were associated positively with ΔMP, indicating that a large amount of infused AA was catabolized to urea. Responses of plasma essential AA concentrations were related positively to ΔMP. The relative effect of ΔMP was highest for responses of plasma His concentration in cows fed grass/legume-based diets and at high MCPMP ratios. This relationship suggests that positive responses of plasma His concentrations are associated with diets relying heavily on microbial protein synthesis (high MCP), low in crude protein (low estimated MP supply), or both. The relationship between ΔMP and responses of plasma group 2 AA (, Leu, Lys, and Val) concentrations was approximately 2 times greater than that for group 1 AA (His, Met, and Phe+) at mean MCPMP and MP supply. This could reflect the low hepatic removal group 2 AA compared with group 1 AA in dairy cows. Collectively, these results provide novel information on how dietary and cow conditions may alter responses to protein supplementation.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

It is an interesting protein not only for drug designing but also to understand the molecular determinants of its substrate specificity. Analysis of the 3D model of L. donovani XPRT (Ld-XPRT) revealed that  209, Glu 215 and  208 may be responsible for the altered substrate specificity of Ld-XPRT. Comparisons with it's nearest homologue in humans, revealed significant differences between the two. A 28 residue long unique motif was identified in Ld-XPRT, which showed highest fluctuation upon substrate binding during MD simulations. In kinetic analysis, Ld-XPRT could phosphoribosylate xanthine, hypoxanthine and guanine with K values of 7.27, 8.13, 8.48μM and k values of 2.24, 1.82, 1.19min respectively. Out of 159 compounds from docking studies, six compounds were characterized further by fluorescence spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy and enzyme inhibition studies. Fluorescence quenching experiment was performed to study the binding of inhibitors with Ld-XPRT and dissociation constants were calculated. Four compounds are bi-substrate analogues and show competitive inhibition with both the substrates (Xanthine and PRPP) of Ld-XPRT. The CD spectral analysis revealed that the binding of inhibitors to Ld-XPRT induce change in its tertiary structure, where as its secondary structure pattern remains unchanged. Two Ld-XPRT inhibitors (dGDP and cGMP), which also have ability to inhibit Leishmanial HGPRT, are predicted as potential drug candidates as it can inhibit both the important enzymes of the purine salvage pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The Gly and Ala variants with a smaller bulk size at position 483 predominantly afforded monocyclic camelliol C, which suggested that the orientation of the (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene substrate was not appropriately arranged in the reaction cavity as a result of the decreased bulk size, leading to failure of its normal folding into the chair-chair-chair-boat-boat conformation. The  variant, with a somewhat larger bulk, afforded β-amyrin as the dominant product. Intriguingly, various variants of Trp534 exhibited significantly decreased enzymatic activities and provided no aberrantly cyclized products, although the aromatic Phe and  residues were incorporated and the steric sizes of the aliphatic residues were altered. Therefore, the Trp534 residue does not stabilize the transient cation through a cation-π interaction. Furthermore, the Trp residue, with the largest steric bulk among all natural amino acids, is essential for high enzymatic activity. Robust CH-π complexation between the Val483 and Trp534 residues is proposed herein. Altering the steric bulk at the Met729 position afforded the pentacyclic skeletons. Thus, Met729 is positioned at the E-ring formation site.

However, the PFAA profiles within non-obese, but more insulin-resistant Asians are not well researched. Compared with Caucasians, Asian populations have more central adiposity, which is generally regarded as metabolically more adverse, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we examined whether PFAA profiling was at least one important factor mediating central adiposity and insulin resistance, and aid in cardiovascular risk assessment in healthy Asians with normal body weight.This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 190 healthy men (n=87 with a mean±s.d. body mass index (BMI) of 23.5±3.5 kg/m) and women (n=103 with a mean±s.d. BMI of 21.4±3.7 kg/m) residing in Singapore took part in this study. PFAA levels were measured by using an amino acid analyzer. Basic anthropometric measurements, fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin and lipid profiles were obtained using standard protocols.Seven out of 18 amino acids were significantly correlated with measures of obesity (for example, waist circumference; waist-to-hip ratio and BMI) in current participants. Among them, the plasma concentrations of five amino acids, including Phe, , Met, Ala and His were positively associated with waist-to-hip ratio. With the exception of His, which had no association with insulin resistance, Phe, , Met and Ala were significantly associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (P<0.05). In contrast, no associations were observed between circulating BCAAs (that is, Val, Leu, ), measures of obesity and insulin resistance. However, significant inverse associations were observed between BCAAs and total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein.We found that central adiposity was associated with alterations of specific amino acids. As a result, PFAAs may serve as metabolite predictors of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia in healthy participants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25568365>The efficacy of a new 6-phytase obtained from Buttiauxella spp. expressed in Trichoderma reesei on digestibility of amino acids, energy, and nutrients in pigs fed a diet based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers' dried grains with solubles.</a></h2><p>Sixteen cannulated pigs were used to evaluate the effect of a new 6-phytase derived from Buttiauxella spp. and expressed in Trichoderma reesei on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of AA and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, N, Ca, P, Na, Mg, K, Cl, and energy. Pigs were fed 4 diets for 2 periods in a crossover design. Within each period, there were 4 blocks of 4 pigs per block with each diet represented within each block. The average initial BW in periods 1 and 2 were 22 and 30 kg, respectively. Each period lasted 9 d with fecal collection on d 5 and 6 and a 12-h ileal digesta collection on d 7, 8, and 9. Pigs received a daily feed allowance of approximately 4.5% of their BW. The experimental diets were based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers dried grain with solubles. Phytase was added at 0; 500; 1,000; or 2,000 phytase units/kg of diet to a basal diet that contained 205, 15, 5.4, and 10 g of CP, Lys, total P (1.6 g of nonphytate P), and Ca/kg diet, respectively. The addition of phytase improved (P < 0.05) AID of DM, N, Ca, and P. Increasing phytase supplementation linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05) AID of P and Ca, respectively, with AID of Ca showing a tendency for a linear increase (P = 0.053). Phytase supplementation of the basal diet improved (P < 0.05) AID of P from 46 to 62%. Phytase supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ATTD of DM, N, Ca, P, Mg, K, and energy. Contrasts showed that phytase supplementation of the basal diet increased (P < 0.05) AID for 8 indispensable AA (Arg, His, , Leu, Lys, Phe, Thr, and Val), 6 dispensable AA (Ala, Asp, Cys, Glu, Ser, and ), as well as for total AA. Furthermore, phytase supplementation to the basal diet showed a tendency (P < 0.10) to increase ileal digestibility of Gly. Ileal digestibility of Met, Trp, and Pro were not affected by phytase supplementation. Increasing the level of phytase supplementation resulted in linear increases (P < 0.05) in AID of 6 indispensable AA (Arg, , Leu, Lys, Phe, and Val) and 1 dispensable AA (Asp) with 4 AA (His, Cys, Glu, and ) showing a tendency for linear increase (P < 0.10) in AID of AA.

In the present study, an ortholog of goose-type lysozyme (ShLysG) from the big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis) was identified and characterized structurally and functionally. The full-length cDNA sequence (1213 bp) of ShLysG is comprised of an open reading frame made up of 552 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 184 amino acid (aa) with a predicted molecular mass of 20 kDa. In silico analysis of ShLysG revealed the absence of signal peptide and the presence of a characteristic bacterial soluble lytic transglycosylase (SLT) domain bearing three catalytic residues (Glu, Asp, and Asp) and seven N-acetyl-d-glucosamine binding sites (Glu, Asp, , His, , , and Asn). Homology analysis demonstrated that the aa sequence of ShLysG shared 60.7-67.4% identity and 72.6-79.3% similarity with the orthologs of other teleosts. Phylogenetic analysis of ShLysG indicated a closest relationship with the ortholog from Gadus morhua. In healthy seahorse, ShLysG mRNA showed a constitutive expression in all the tissues examined, with the highest expression in kidney and the least expression in liver. The ShLysG mRNA levels were also shown significant elevation upon the bacterial and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) challenges. Furthermore, lytic activities of ShLysG recombinant protein were detected against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species. Taken together, these results suggest that ShLysG might possess a potential immune defensive role against invading microbial pathogens in seahorse.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence in obesity and type-2 diabetes suggests a role for a  inflammasome ("metaflammasome") in mediating chronic inflammation in peripheral organs implicating IKKβ (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta), IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), JNK (c-jun N-terminal kinase), and PKR (double-stranded RNA protein kinase). We hypothesized that these proteins are expressed in the brain in response to  risk factors in AD. Neocortex from 299 participants from the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies was analysed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of the phosphorylated (active) form of IKKβ [pSer ], IRS1 [pS ], JNK [pThr / ] and PKR [pT ]. The data were analyzed to investigate whether the proteins were expressed together and in relation with  disorders, dementia, Alzheimer's pathology and APOE genotype. We observed a change from a positive to a negative association between the proteins and hypertension according to the dementia status. Type-2 diabetes was negatively related with the proteins among participants without dementia; whereas participants with dementia and AD pathology showed a positive association with JNK. A significant association between IKKβ and JNK in participants with dementia and AD pathology was observed, but not in those without dementia. Otherwise, weak to moderate associations were observed among the protein loads. The presence of dementia was significantly associated with JNK and negatively associated with IKKβ and IRS1. Cognitive scores showed a significant positive relationship with IKKβ and a negative with IRS1, JNK and PKR. The proteins were significantly associated with pathology in Alzheimer's participants with the relationship being inverse or not significant in participants without dementia. Expression of the proteins was not related to APOE genotype. These findings highlight a role for these proteins in AD pathophysiology but not necessarily as a complex.© 2016 The Authors.

The present study focused on the relationship between the gut microbiota and the brain amino acids. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) mice were used as experimental models. Plasma and brain regions were sampled from mice at 7 and 16 weeks of age, and analysed for free d- and l-amino acids, which are believed to affect many physiological functions. At 7 weeks of age, plasma concentrations of d-aspartic acid (d-Asp), l-alanine (l-Ala), l-glutamine (l-Gln) and taurine were higher in SPF mice than in GF mice, but no differences were found at 16 weeks of age. Similar patterns were observed for the concentrations of l-Asp in striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and l-arginine (l-Arg), l-Ala and l-valine (l-Val) in striatum. In addition, the concentrations of l-Asp, d-Ala, l-histidine, l-isoleucine (l-), l-leucine (l-Leu), l-phenylalanine and l-Val were significantly higher in plasma of SPF mice when compared with those of GF mice. The concentrations of l-Arg, l-Gln, l- and l-Leu were significantly higher in SPF than in GF mice, but those of d-Asp, d-serine and l-serine were higher in some brain regions of GF mice than in those of SPF mice. In conclusion, the concentration of amino acids in the host brain seems to be dependent on presence of the gut microbiota. Amino acid  in the host brain may be modified by manipulating microbiota communities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30785183>Morelloflavone as a novel inhibitor of mitotic kinesin Eg5.</a></h2><p>Among 40 plant-derived biflavonoids with inhibitory potential against Eg5, morelloflavone from Garcinia dulcis leaves was selected for further testing based on in silico analysis of binding modes, molecular interactions, binding energies and functional groups that interact with Eg5. Computational models predicted that morelloflavone binds the putative allosteric pocket of Eg5, within the cavity surrounded by amino acid residues of -136, Glu-116, Glu-118, Trp-127, Gly-117, Ala-133, Glu-215, Leu-214 and -211. Binding energy was -8.4 kcal/mol, with a single hydrogen bond formed between morelloflavone and -211. The binding configuration was comparable to that of a reference inhibitor, S-trityl-L-cysteine. Subsequent biochemical analysis in vitro confirmed that morelloflavone inhibited both the basal and microtubule-activated ATPase activity of Eg5 in a manner that does not compete with ATP binding. Morelloflavone also suppressed Eg5 gliding along microtubules. These results suggest that morelloflavone binds the allosteric binding site in Eg5 and thereby inhibits ATPase activity and motor function of Eg5.© The Author(s) 2019.

Male Ross 308 broiler chickens received a standard starter diet from d 0 to 16 post hatching, thereafter grouped into 8 blocks, based on body weight (BW), of 10 birds/cage, and randomly allotted to 6 diets in a randomized complete block design. The 6 diets consisted of a nitrogen-free diet, 3 semi-purified diets, and 2 mixed diets to test the additivity of AID and SID in mixed diets. On d 21 post hatching, digesta from two-thirds of the distal ileum was collected. Using the determined AID or SID for CP and AA in wheat, canola meal (CM), or sorghum distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), the AID or SID for 2 mixed diets based on wheat-CM or wheat-CM-DDGS were predicted and compared with determined AID or SID, respectively. The results revealed that the predicted SID of CP and AA in the wheat-CM mixed diet were consistent with determined values except for Asp and Ser, and all the predicted SID of CP and AA were consistent with the determined values in the wheat-CM-DDGS mixed diet. The determined AID of , Met, Thr, Val, Ala, Cys, Ser, and  in the wheat-CM mixed diet were greater (P < 0.05) than predicted AID values. For the wheat-CM-DDGS mixed diet, the determined AID of Trp, Cys, and Glu were greater (P < 0.05) than the predicted AID values. However, there were more inconsistencies between the determined and predicted values in AID values for wheat-CM than the wheat-CM-DDGS mixed diet than SID values for both diets. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that the SID of CP and AA was more additive than the AID of CP and AA when a mixed diet contained wheat, CM, and DDGS as protein sources in broiler chickens.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29855381>Module and individual domain deletions of NRPS to produce plipastatin derivatives in Bacillus subtilis.</a></h2><p>Plipastatin, an antifungal lipopeptide, is synthesized by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) in Bacillus subtilis. However, little information is available on the combinatorial biosynthesis strategies applied in plipastatin biosynthetic pathway. In this study, we applied module or individual domain deletion strategies to engineer the plipastatin biosynthetic pathway, and investigated the effect of deletions on the plipastatin assembly line, as well as revealed the synthetic patterns of novel lipopeptides.Module deletion inactivated the entire enzyme complex, whereas individual domain (A/T domain) deletion within module 7 truncated the assembly line, resulting in truncated linear hexapeptides (Cβ-OHFA-Glu-Orn--Thr-Glu-Ala/Val). Interestingly, within the module 6 catalytic unit, the effect of thiolation domain deletion differed from that of adenylation deletion. Absence of the T-domain resulted in a nonproductive strain, whereas deletion of the A-domain resulted in multiple assembly lines via module-skipping mechanism, generating three novel types of plipastatin derivatives, pentapeptides (Cβ-OHFA-Glu-Orn--Thr-Glu), hexapeptides (Cβ-OHFA-Glu-Orn--Thr-Glu-), and octapeptides (Cβ-OHFA-Glu-Orn--Thr-Glu-Gln--).Notably, a unique module-skipping process occurred following deletion of the A-domain, which has not been previously reported for engineered NRPS systems. This finding provides new insight into the lipopeptides engineering.

The aliphatic variants (Ala, Val, Met) of Trp612 showed almost no activity, but the aromatic variants exhibited high activities: 12.5 % of the wild-type activity for the W612H variant, 43 % for W612F, and 63 % for W612Y. That is, the enzymatic activities of the variants increased in proportion to the increase in π-electron density. Thus, the major function of Trp612 is to stabilize transient cations through a cation-π interaction. The Phe and  variants caused a distorted folding conformation, especially at the E-ring site, which generated the aberrantly cyclized products germanicol and lupeol. The L734G and L734A variants exhibited significantly decreased activities but yielded taraxerol in a high production ratio. The Val, , and Met variants showed markedly high activities (56-78 % of wild-type activity); therefore, appropriate steric bulk is required at this position. The aliphatic variants of Tyr736 showed markedly decreased activities, but the Phe mutant exhibited high activity (67 %), which indicates that the π electrons are critical for catalysis. Homology modeling indicated that Tyr736 and Leu734 are perpendicular to the substrate and are situated face to face, which suggests that a CH-π interaction occurs between Tyr736 and Leu734, reinforcing the protein architecture, and that Tyr736 cannot stabilize cationic intermediates through a cation-π interaction.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The seed hull, which greatly contributes to the fiber content of CM, is denser than the oil-free cotyledon. By utilizing streams of air, air classification partially separates these seed components on the basis of their different sizes and densities to produce a low-fiber, light-particle fraction and a high-fiber, heavy-particle fraction. Compared with parent CM, ADF and NDF were reduced by 31.9% and 29.5% in the light-particle fraction and were enriched by 16.5% and 9.0% in the heavy-particle fraction (DM basis), respectively. Particle size was 638, 18.9, and 76.1 µm for the parent CM and light- and heavy-particle fractions, respectively. To determine the nutrient digestibility of CM and their air-classified fractions, Brassica napus and B. juncea CM and their 2 air-classified fractions were evaluated in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement together with a basal diet and an N-free diet. The experiment was conducted as an 8 × 8 Latin square in which diets contained 40% B. napus or B. juncea CM or their air-classified fractions and 60% basal diet. Digesta data from pigs fed the N-free diet served to subtract basal endogenous AA losses. Eight ileal-cannulated barrows (32 kg initial BW) were fed the 8 diets at 2.7 times maintenance DE for eight 11-d periods. At the end of each period, feces were collected for 48 h, and ileal digesta were collected for two 12-h periods. The DE and calculated NE values and the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of GE were 6.3%, 10.0%, and 7.8% greater (P < 0.001) for B. juncea CM than for B. napus CM; 6.1%, 10.8%, and 5.3% greater (P < 0.001) for the light-particle fraction than for parent CM; and 5.4%, 7.2%, and 3.8% lower (P < 0.001) for the heavy-particle fraction than for parent CM, respectively. The standardized ileal digestibilities (SID) of His, , Val, Asp, and  were greater (P < 0.05) for B. juncea CM than for B. napus CM. The SID of CP and AA were greater (P < 0.01) in the light-particle fraction than in the heavy-particle fraction. The SID of Trp, Glu, Pro, and  were greater (P < 0.05) in the light-particle fraction than in parent CM. In conclusion, B. juncea CM had greater energy and AA digestibility than B. napus CM because of reduced fiber content. Air classification of CM increased its energy and AA digestibility in the light-particle fraction for pigs because of the reduced dietary fiber content and decreased particle size.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28351018>Profiles of amino acids and biogenic amines in the plasma of Cri-du-Chat patients.</a></h2><p>Cri-du-chat syndrome (CDCS) is a rare innate disease attributed to chromosome 5p deletion characterized by a cat-like cry, craniofacial malformation, and altered behavior of affected children.

In mammalian mitochondria, the initial step of the Fe-S cluster assembly process is assisted by the NFS1-ISD11 complex, which delivers sulfur to scaffold protein ISCU during Fe-S cluster synthesis. Although ISD11 is an essential protein, its cellular role in Fe-S cluster biogenesis is still not defined. Our study maps the important ISD11 amino acid residues belonging to putative helix 1 (Phe-40), helix 3 (Leu-63, Arg-68, Gln-69, -72, -76), and C-terminal segment (Leu-81, Glu-84) are critical for in vivo Fe-S cluster biogenesis. Importantly, mutation of these conserved ISD11 residues into alanine leads to its compromised interaction with NFS1, resulting in reduced stability and enhanced aggregation of NFS1 in the mitochondria. Due to altered interaction with ISD11 mutants, the levels of NFS1 and Isu1 were significantly depleted, which affects Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, leading to reduced electron transport chain complex (ETC) activity and mitochondrial respiration. In humans, a clinically relevant ISD11 mutation (R68L) has been associated in the development of a mitochondrial genetic disorder, COXPD19. Our findings highlight that the ISD11 R68A/R68L mutation display reduced affinity to form a stable subcomplex with NFS1, and thereby fails to prevent NFS1 aggregation resulting in impairment of the Fe-S cluster biogenesis. The prime affected machinery is the ETC complex, which showed compromised redox properties, causing diminished mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, the R68L ISD11 mutant displayed accumulation of mitochondrial iron and reactive oxygen species, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, which correlates with the phenotype observed in COXPD19 patients.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28152597>GC-MS Metabolomics Identifies Metabolite Alterations That Precede Subclinical Mastitis in the Blood of Transition Dairy Cows.</a></h2><p>The objectives of this study were to determine alterations in the serum metabolites related to amino acid (AA), carbohydrate, and lipid  in transition dairy cows before diagnosis of subclinical mastitis (SCM), during, and after diagnosis of disease. A subclinical mastitis case was determined as a cow having somatic cell count (SCC) > 200 000/mL of milk for two or more consecutive reports. Blood samples were collected from 100 Holstein dairy cows at five time points at -8 and -4 weeks before parturition, at the week of SCM diagnosis, and +4 and +8 weeks after parturition. Twenty healthy control cows (CON) and six cows that were diagnosed with SCM were selected for serum analysis with GC-MS. At -8 weeks a total of 13 metabolites were significantly altered in SCM cows. In addition, at the week of SCM diagnosis 17 metabolites were altered in these cows. Four weeks after parturition 10 metabolites were altered in SCM cows and at +8 weeks 11 metabolites were found to be different between the two groups. Valine (Val), serine (Ser), tyrosine (), and phenylalanine (Phe) had very good predictive abilities for SCM and could be used at -8 weeks and -4 weeks before calving. Combination of Val, isoleucine (), Ser, and proline (Pro) can be used as diagnostic biomarkers of SCM during early stages of lactation at +4 to +8 weeks after parturition. In conclusion, SCM is preceded and followed by alteration in AA .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26160710>A Novel, Stable, Estradiol-Stimulating, Osteogenic Yam Protein with Potential for the Treatment of Menopausal Syndrome.</a></h2><p>A novel protein, designated as DOI, isolated from the Chinese yam (Dioscorea opposita Thunb.) could be the first protein drug for the treatment of menopausal syndrome and an alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which is known to have undesirable side effects. DOI is an acid- and thermo-stable protein with a distinctive N-terminal sequence Gly--Gly-Lys--Thr-Thr--Trp-Gly-Gln--Ser-Asp-Glu-Pro-Ser-Leu-Thr-Glu. DOI was found to stimulate estradiol biosynthesis in rat ovarian granulosa cells; induce estradiol and progesterone secretion in 16- to 18-month-old female Sprague Dawley rats by upregulating expressions of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor and ovarian aromatase; counteract the progression of osteoporosis and augment bone mineral density; and improve cognitive functioning by upregulating protein expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and TrkB receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, DOI did not stimulate the proliferation of breast cancer and ovarian cancer cells, which suggest it could be a more efficacious and safer alternative to HRT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250878>Postprandial insulin and nutrient concentrations in lipopolysaccharide-challenged growing pigs reared in thermoneutral and high ambient temperatures1.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the associated effects of ambient temperature and inflammation caused by repeated administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on insulin, energy, and AA . Twenty-eight pigs were assigned to one of the two thermal conditions: thermoneutral (24 °C) or high ambient temperature (30 °C). The experimental period lasted 17 d, which was divided into a 7-d period without LPS (days -7 to -1), and a subsequent 10-d LPS period (days 1 to 10) in which pigs were administered 5 repeated injections of LPS at 2-d intervals. Postprandial profiles of plasma insulin and nutrients were evaluated through serial blood samples taken on days -4 (P0), 4 (P1), and 8 (P2). Before the LPS-challenge (P0), postprandial concentrations of glucose, lactate, Gln, , Leu, Phe, , and Val were greater in pigs kept at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). In contrast, Arg, Asp, Gly, His, and Met postprandial concentrations at P0 were lower at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). At both 24 and 30 °C conditions, pigs had greater postprandial concentrations of insulin (P < 0.01) and lower concentrations of NEFA (P < 0.01) and α-amino nitrogen (P < 0.05) at P1 and P2 than at P0. Compared with P0, postprandial concentrations of glucose were greater (P < 0.05) at P1 in pigs kept at 24 °C, and at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 30 °C. At both ambient temperatures, pigs had lower (P < 0.05) postprandial concentrations of Ala, Gly, His, , Leu, Pro, Ser, Thr, Trp, and Val at P1 and P2 than at P0. Arginine postprandial concentration at P1 was lower than at P0 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was observed in pigs at 30 °C. Relative to P0, Gln and  concentrations were lower at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.01), whereas lower Gln concentration was observed only at P2 (P < 0.01) and lower  only at P1 (P < 0.01) in pigs kept at 30 °C. Our study shows a hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic state in LPS-challenged pigs and a greater magnitude of this response in pigs kept at 30 °C. Furthermore, LPS caused important changes in BCAA, His, Thr, and Trp profiles, suggesting the role these AA in supporting the inflammatory response. Finally, our results suggest that LPS-induced effects on postprandial profiles of specific AA (Arg, Gln, Phe, and ) may be modulated by ambient temperature.© The Author(s) 2019.

The ENaC/DEG superfamily differs markedly in its means of activation, such as spontaneously opening or gating by mechanical stimuli or tissue acidosis. Recently, it has been observed that a number of ENaC/DEG channels can be activated by small molecules or peptides, indicating that the ligand-gating may be an important feature of this superfamily. The peptide ligand control of the channel gating might be an ancient ligand-gating feature in this superfamily. Therefore, studying the peptide recognition of FaNaC channels would advance our understanding of the ligand-gating properties of this superfamily of ion channels. Here we demonstrate that -131, Asn-134, Asp-154, and -160, located in the putative upper finger domain ofHelix aspersaFaNaC (HaFaNaC) channels, are key residues for peptide recognition of this ion channel. Two HaFaNaC specific-insertion motifs among the ENaC/DEG superfamily, residing at the putative α4-α5 linker of the upper thumb domain and the α6-α7 linker of the upper knuckle domain, are also essential for the peptide recognition of HaFaNaC channels. Chemical modifications and double mutant cycle analysis further indicated that those two specific inserts and key residues in the upper finger domain together participate in peptide recognition of HaFaNaC channels. This ligand recognition site is distinct from that of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) by a longer distance between the recognition site and the channel gate, carrying useful information about the ligand gating and the evolution of the trimeric ENaC/DEG superfamily of ion channels.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25726107>Short communication: Evaluation of amino acid consumption and necessary profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus T1C2 in controlled pH batch fermentations.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between amino acid consumption and necessary profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus T1C2 to guide the design of media for high-cell-density culture. The amino acid consumption and necessary patterns of S. thermophilus T1C2 were investigated in the complete chemically defined medium. For amino acid consumption profiles throughout the growth of S. thermophilus T1C2, the most abundantly consumed amino acids were Gln and Arg, which accounted for 19 and 20% of total amino acids consumed, respectively. Asparagine, Thr, Ser, Ala, Val, Met, Leu, and Lys, consumptions of which ranged from 3 to 10% of total amino acids consumed, were the second most intensively consumed amino acids. For necessary amino acid patterns, the amount of Cys, which counted for 11% of total amino acids needed, was significantly higher than the amounts required for other amino acids in growth of S. thermophilus T1C2. The necessary amounts of Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Arg, Ala, Met, and  ranked second, ranging from 5 to 8% of total amino acids needed. Compared with necessary amounts, the consumption of Asn, Thr, Ser, Gln, Arg, Ala, Val, Leu, Lys, His, and Phe exceeded the necessary amounts for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 remarkably. Consumption of Gly, Met, , Trp, and Pro was slightly higher than the necessary amounts. Consumption of Asp, Glu, , and Cys was lower than the necessary amounts. The overall consumption of amino acids exceeded the required amount for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 almost 2.43 times, which implied a significant nitrogen wasting.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

RasGRP2 is exceptional in that its C1 domain has very weak binding affinity (Kd = 2890 ± 240 nm for [(3)H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. We have identified four amino acid residues responsible for this lack of sensitivity. Replacing Asn(7), Ser(8), Ala(19), and (21) with the corresponding residues from RasGRP1/3 (Thr(7), (8), Gly(19), and Leu(21), respectively) conferred potent binding affinity (Kd = 1.47 ± 0.03 nm) in vitro and membrane translocation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in LNCaP cells. Mutant C1 domains incorporating one to three of the four residues showed intermediate behavior with S8Y making the greatest contribution. Binding activity for diacylglycerol was restored in parallel. The requirement for anionic phospholipid for [(3)H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding was determined; it decreased in going from the single S8Y mutant to the quadruple mutant. The full-length RasGRP2 protein with the mutated C1 domains also showed strong phorbol ester binding, albeit modestly weaker than that of the C1 domain alone (Kd = 8.2 ± 1.1 nm for the full-length protein containing all four mutations), and displayed translocation in response to phorbol ester. RasGRP2 is a guanyl exchange factor for Rap1. Consistent with the ability of phorbol ester to induce translocation of the full-length RasGRP2 with the mutated C1 domain, phorbol ester enhanced the ability of the mutated RasGRP2 to activate Rap1. Modeling confirmed that the four mutations helped the binding cleft maintain a stable conformation.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28185437>Crosslinked Network with Rotatable Binding Sites Based on Monocarboxylated α-Cyclodextrin [2]Rotaxane Capable of Angiotensin III Recognition.</a></h2><p>Synthetic receptors selective for target peptides or proteins have received attention because of their potential applications in the separation of biomolecules and biomedical diagnostics. Herein, a [2]rotaxane-based functional monomer containing monocarboxylated α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) was synthesized, and its crosslinked polymers were evaluated to determine their binding ability to a model peptide, angiotensin III (Arg-Val---His-Pro-Phe), containing an arginine (Arg) residue. The binding ability of the resulting polymers toward angiotensin III, angiotensin IV (Val---His-Pro-Phe), and FMRF-amide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe) was examined by the batch-binding assay and compared with that of control polymers, in which maleic acid-introduced α-CD was chemically crosslinked. The results suggest that the [2]rotaxane-based functional monomer in the crosslinked polymer contributes to the high affinity toward angiotensin III. The α-CD motion and rotation within the [2]rotaxane-based crosslinked polymer may be applicable for designing molecular recognition materials.© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We have recently demonstrated that the mechanism of action involves the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This fact suggested a potential activity of the same peptides on glucose  that prompted us to also investigate this aspect in the same cells. After treatment with IAVPGEVA, IAVPTGVA and LPYP, HepG2 cells were analyzed using a combination of molecular techniques, including western blot analysis, glucose uptake experiments and fluorescence microscopy evaluation. The results showed that these peptides are indeed able to enhance the capacity of HepG2 cells to uptake glucose, via glucose transporter 1 GLUT1 and glucose transporter 4 GLUT4 activation, through the stimulation of protein kinase B Akt and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase AMPK , both involved in glucose .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25561169>Structural insights into stereospecific reduction of α, β-unsaturated carbonyl substrates by old yellow enzyme from Gluconobacter oxydans.</a></h2><p>We report the crystal structure of old yellow enzyme (OYE) family protein Gox0502 (a.a 1-315) in free form at 3.3 Å. Detailed structural analysis revealed the key residues involved in stereospecific determination of Gox0502, such as Trp66 and Trp100. Structure-based computational analysis suggested the bulky side chains of these tryptophan residues may play important roles in product stereoselectivity. The introduction of  or Phe or  mutation significantly reduced the product diastereoselectivity. We hypothesized that less bulky side chains at these critical residues could create additional free space to accommodate intermediates with different conformations. Notably, the introduction of Phe mutation at residue Trp100 increased catalytic activity compared to wild-type Gox0502 toward a set of substrates tested, which suggests that a less bulky Phe side chain at residue W100F may facilitate product release. Therefore, Gox0502 structure could provide useful information to generate desirable OYEs suitable for biotechnological applications in industry.</p></html>
