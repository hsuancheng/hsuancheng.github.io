Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) adversely affects posttransplant outcomes, but its risk factors in relation to cholesterol metabolism have not been fully delineated. The apolipoprotein /A1 (Apo /A1) ratio, which is associated with , has not been evaluated in kidney transplant recipients as a risk factor for PTDM.The objective of this study was to determine whether serum apolipoprotein profiles predict late PTDM, defined as a new onset diabetes occurring greater than 3 months posttransplant.Retrospective chart review of a prevalent population of kidney transplant recipients.Large transplant center in Ontario, Canada.We identified 1104 previously nondiabetic adults who received a kidney transplant between January 1, 1998, and December 1, 2015, and were followed at 1 transplant center.Recipients provided testing for serum apolipoprotein  (Apo ) and apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1) concentrations from 2010, either at 3 months posttransplant for new transplant recipients or the next clinic visit for prevalent recipients. Late PTDM defined using Canadian Diabetes Association criteria as occurring ≥3 months posttransplant was recorded until May 1, 2016.All analyses were conducted with R, version 3.4.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Comparisons were made using Student  test, Fisher exact test or chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier methodology with the logrank test, or Cox proportional hazards analysis as appropriate. Covariates for the multivariate Cox proportional hazards models of PTDM as the outcome variable were selected based on significance of the univariate associations and biological plausibility.There were 53 incident late PTDM cases, or 1.71 cases per 100 patient-years. Incident late PTDM differed between the highest and lowest quartiles for Apo /A1 ratio, 2.47 per 100 patient-years vs 0.88 per 100 patient-years ( = .005 for difference). In multiple Cox regression analysis, first measured serum Apo /A1 concentration better predicted subsequent PTDM than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; hazard ratio [HR] = 7.80 per unit increase,  = .039 vs HR = 1.05 per unit increase,  = .774). Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations also did not predict PTDM ( = .136). By contrast to Apo , Apo A1 was protective against PTDM in statin users (HR = 0.17 per unit increase,  = .016).Posttransplant diabetes mellitus cases occurring before apolipoprotein testing was implemented were not included in the analysis.Apolipoproteins  and A1 better predict late PTDM than conventional markers of cholesterol metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558861>Allyl isothiocyanate ameliorates lipid accumulation and inflammation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease  the Sirt1/AMPK and NF-κ signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a classic anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic agent, was recently identified as a potential treatment for obesity and . However, little is known about its direct impact on the liver.To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of AITC in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (commonly referred to as NAFLD).To establish a mouse and cellular model of NAFLD, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk, and AML-12 cells were treated with 200 μM palmitate acid for 24 h. For AITC treatment, mice were administered AITC (100 mg/kg/d) orally and AML-12 cells were treated with AITC (20 μmol/L).AITC significantly ameliorated HFD-induced weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation . Furthermore, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were markedly reduced in AITC-treated mice. Mechanistically, AITC significantly downregulated the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its lipogenesis target genes and upregulated the levels of proteins involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, as well as the upstream mediators Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), in the livers of HFD-fed mice. AITC also attenuated the nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) signaling pathway. Consistently, AITC relieved palmitate acid-induced lipid accumulation and inflammation in AML-12 cells  through the Sirt1/AMPK and NF-κ signaling pathways. Importantly, further studies showed that the curative effect of AITC on lipid accumulation was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of either Sirt1 or AMPKα in AML-12 cells.AITC significantly ameliorates hepatic steatosis and inflammation by activating the Sirt1/AMPK pathway and inhibiting the NF-κ pathway. Therefore, AITC is a potential therapeutic agent for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31183921>Effectiveness of Eriomin® in managing hyperglycemia and reversal of prediabetes condition: A double-blind, randomized, controlled study.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the potential effectiveness of different doses of Eriomin® on hyperglycemia and  associated with other metabolic biomarkers in prediabetic individuals.

Attempts to identify risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are still underway.To examine a possible association between NAFLD and rUTIs among premenopausal women.In a case-control study, 1009 hospitalized premenopausal women with a UTI during a period of 3 years were retrospectively studied. A total of 186 subjects with rUTIs and 186 controls without a history of rUTIs were included in this study. Each participant had an abdominal ultrasonogram as part of the inclusion criteria. The two groups were compared in terms of risk factors for rUTIs, such as maternal history of rUTIs, use of contraceptives, frequency of sexual intercourse, metabolic syndrome, obesity, use of probiotics, serum levels of vitamin D, and NAFLD. An rUTI was defined as three or more episodes of UTI over a period of 1 year. NAFLD was diagnosed based on abdominal ultrasonography examination.Mean age of the 372 participants was 39.7 ± 5 years. NAFLD was diagnosed in 81/186 subjects (43.5%) with rUTIs vs. 40/186 controls (21.5%), P = 0.05. Women with rUTIs were more often obese and presented with lower serum levels of vitamin D than controls. Multivariate analysis showed that NAFLD (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-2.0, P = 0.04) were associated with rUTIs in premenopausal women.NAFLD was associated with rUTI in premenopausal women, independent of metabolic syndrome.

Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are more common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients than in their nondiabetic counterparts. Current guidelines are neither clear nor specific about the frequency of thyroid function monitoring in T2DM patients. Circulating thyroid hormones affect several different organs and cells, have a major impact on glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism, and can worsen glycaemic control in T2DM. Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis can worsen subclinical DM and cause hyperglycaemia in T2DM patients, increasing the risk of diabetic complications. T2DM reduces thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and impairs the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) in the peripheral tissues. Poorly managed T2DM can lead to  and hyperinsulinaemia, which causes thyroid tissue proliferation and increases nodule formation and goitre size. In addition, while metformin can be beneficial in both T2DM and TD patients, other antidiabetics such as sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, and thiazolidinediones can negatively impact TD. Antithyroid drugs such as methimazole can impair glycaemic control in T2DM patients. Thyrovigilance in T2DM patients and diabetovigilance in TD patients may therefore be necessary to facilitate individualized care and management.Funding: Abbott India Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339394>Efficacy of combination therapy of inositols, antioxidants and vitamins in obese and non-obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome: an observational study.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in women of both developed and developing countries.

Global MS-based metabolomics and targeted metabolite profiling of catechins/catechin metabolites are evaluated. GTE in HF mice restores hepatic metabolites implicated in dyslipidemia , and inflammation. These include 122 metabolites: amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, vitamins, bile acids, flavonoids, xenobiotics, and carbohydrates. Hepatic amino acids, -vitamins, and bile acids are inversely correlated with biomarkers of , liver injury, steatosis, and inflammation. Further, phosphatidylcholine metabolites are positively correlated with biomarkers of liver injury and NFκ inflammation.

The levels of glucose uptake, GLUT4, protein kinase A (PKA), and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were determined in human skeletal muscle myotubes (HSMMs) exposed to palmitate and GLP‑1. Then, to determine whether PKA/cAMP were downstream signals of GLP‑1, a PKA inhibitor was used. To determine whether SIRT‑1 contributes to GLP‑1 action in HSMMs with palmitate‑induced , the levels of peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α) deacetylation and SIRT‑1 activity were assessed using a SIRT1 inhibitor and small interfering RNA (siRNA). The phosphorylation levels of protein kinase  (Akt) and  receptor substrate 1 (IRS‑1) as  signaling pathways, were assessed in GLP‑1‑treated HSMMs exposed to palmitate. The influence of SIRT1 on the GLP‑1‑induced activation of  signaling pathway was determined using a SIRT1 inhibitor. GLP‑1 restored the palmitate‑induced reductions in the levels of glucose uptake, GLUT4 mRNA, GLUT4 promoter activity, and GLUT4 protein in HSMMs. PKA and cAMP, as GLP‑1 downstream signals, played a role in this process. GLP‑1 increased the deacetylation levels of PGC1α, and stimulated SIRT1 in HSMMs. Moreover, the SIRT1 inhibitor and siRNA of SIRT1 suppressed the effect of GLP‑1 on GLUT4 expression in HSMMs exposed to palmitate. The SIRT1 inhibitor also prevented the GLP‑1‑induced phosphorylation of IRS‑1 and Akt in palmitate‑treated HSMMs. The present findings suggest that in palmitate‑induced ‑resistant HSMM, GLP‑1 activates SIRT1 through the PKA/cAMP pathway, which in turn enhances glucose uptake through GLUT4 and the  signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31210062>Analytical evaluation and clinical application of  and C-peptide by a whole blood, lateral flow, point of care (POC) assay system.</a></h2><p>The analytical performance and clinical application of measuring  and connecting peptide (C-peptide) by point of care (POC) assay were evaluated.

Previous studies identified miRNAs that regulate transcription factors, including Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARG), in adipocytes, but whether they influence adipogenesis via such regulatory loops remain elusive. Here we predicted and validated a novel feed-forward loop regulating adipogenesis and involved miR-27a/-3p, PPARG and Secretory Carrier Membrane Protein 3 (SCAMP3). In this loop, expression of both PPARG and SCAMP3 was independently suppressed by miR-27a/-3p overexpression. Knockdown of PPARG downregulated SCAMP3 expression at the late phase of adipogenesis, whereas reduction of SCAMP3 mRNA levels increased PPARG expression at early phase in differentiation. The latter was accompanied with upregulation of adipocyte-enriched genes, including ADIPOQ and FABP4, suggesting an anti-adipogenic role for SCAMP3. PPARG and SCAMP3 exhibited opposite behaviors regarding correlations with clinical phenotypes, including body mass index, body fat mass, adipocyte size, lipolytic and lipogenic capacity, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

In addition, it controlled oxidative stress markers, lipoapoptosis, liver injury panels, and inflammatory and fibrotic mediators, eventually influencing steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. Moreover, it exhibited pharmacological activities against hyperlipidemia, obesity, and hyperglycemia as well as appetite. These biological actions of  might contribute to adiponectin activation or a role as a farnesoid X receptor agonist. In particular, Alisol A 24-acetate and Alisol  23-acetate could be expected as main compounds.

This study is the first to describe a role for the medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) receptor G-protein-coupled receptor (Gpr) 84 in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and  secretion. We are able to show that Gpr84 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Mice with global deletion of  [ knockout (KO)] exhibit a mild impairment in glucose tolerance when fed a MCFA-enriched diet. Studies in mice and pancreatic islets suggest that glucose intolerance is accompanied by a defect in  secretion. MCFA-fed KO mice also exhibit a significant impairment in the intrinsic respiratory capacity of their skeletal muscle mitochondria, but at the same time also exhibit a substantial increase in mitochondrial content. Changes in canonical pathways of mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover are unable to explain these mitochondrial differences.

Dose levels were 0.25, 0.75, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/d in an oral suspension formulation (12 boys per dose level; one-third to 10 times the glucocorticoid dose in DMD). The primary goal was to define optimal doses of vamorolone. The primary outcome for clinical efficacy was time to stand from supine velocity.Oral administration of vamorolone at all doses tested was safe and well tolerated over the 24-week treatment period. The 2.0-mg/kg/d dose group met the primary efficacy outcome of improved muscle function (time to stand; 24 weeks of vamorolone treatment vs natural history controls), without evidence of most adverse effects of glucocorticoids. A biomarker of bone formation, osteocalcin, increased in vamorolone-treated boys, suggesting possible loss of bone morbidities seen with glucocorticoids.

We aimed to evaluate the associations of race, genotype, prenatal factors, and postnatal factors with IMCL in early childhood.This study was a secondary analysis performed on the GUSTO birth cohort. Soleus muscle IMCL of 392 children at 4.5 years of age was measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, of which usable imaging data were obtained from 277 children (137 Chinese, 87 Malays, and 53 Indians). Metabolic assessments (fasting glucose, , and HOMA-IR) were performed at age 6.The mean IMCL level at 4.5 years was 0.481 ± 0.279% of water resonance (mean ± sd). Corroborating with results from adults, Indian children had the highest IMCL levels compared with Malay and Chinese children. Among the prenatal factors, the rate of gestational weight gain (GWG rate) was associated with offspring IMCL ( = 0.396 (0.069, 0.724); p = 0.018). Both race and GWG rate continued to be associated with offspring IMCL even after accounting for current offspring BMI. Postnatally, IMCL was associated with shorter breastfeeding duration ( = 0.065 (0.001, 0.128); p = 0.045) and conditional relative weight gain between ages 2 and 3 ( = 0.052 (0.012, 0.093); p = 0.012).

Here, we show that nuclear Sirt, Sirt6, and mitochondrial Sirt, Sirt3, regulate each other's activity and protect the heart from developing diabetic cardiomyopathy. We found that expression of both Sirt6 and Sirt3 was reduced in cardiomyocytes treated with palmitate and in hearts of mice fed with a high-fat, high-sucrose (HF-HS) diet to develop obesity and diabetes. Conversely, whole-body overexpressing Sirt6 transgenic (Tg.Sirt6) mice were protected from developing obesity and  when fed with the same HF-HS diet. The hearts of Tg.Sirt6 mice were also protected from mitochondrial fragmentation and decline of Sirt3, resulting otherwise from HF-HS diet feeding. Mechanistic studies showed that Sirt3 preserves Sirt6 levels by reducing oxidative stress, whereas Sirt6 maintains Sirt3 levels by up-regulating nuclear respiratory factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent Sirt3 gene transcription. We found that Sirt6 regulates Nrf2-mediated cardiac gene expression in 2 ways; first, Sirt6 suppresses expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), a negative regulator of Nrf2, and second, Sirt6 binds to Nrf2 and antagonizes its interaction with Keap1, thereby stabilizing Nrf2 levels in cardiomyocytes.

A total of 896 men and 910 women completed a validated quantitative food frequency questionnaire and anthropometric measurements and donated a fasting blood sample. Using general linear models, covariate-adjusted mean levels of lipid-soluble micronutrients (total carotenes, lycopene, total tocopherols, total lutein, cryptoxanthins), biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], tumor necrosis factor-  ), adipokines (adiponectin, leptin), lipids (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], triglycerides), and glucose metabolism (glucose, , homeostatic model assessment of  [HOMA-IR]) were computed across tertiles of 4  dietary indices Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010, Alternative HEI (AHEI)-2010, alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH); trends were evaluated in models with diet quality scores as continuous variables.

Next, we used multivariable linear regression to examine associations of sex, baseline overweight/obesity, baseline pubertal status and race/ethnicity with change in the biomarkers during follow-up.  Boys exhibited a larger decrement in adiponectin (-0.66 [95% CI = -1.14, -0.18)] ng/mL) and a greater increase in SBP (3.20 [2.10, 4.30] mmHg) than girls. Overweight/obese participants experienced larger increases in HOMA-IR, leptin, and triglycerides; and a steeper decrement in HDL. Pubertal youth showed larger decrements in total and LDL cholesterol than their pre-pubertal counterparts. In comparison to White participants, Black youth experienced a larger magnitude of increase in HOMA-IR, and Hispanic youth exhibited larger decrements in adiponectin and HDL.

In New Zealand, type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes disproportionally affect Māori, Pacific, and South Asian peoples. This research evaluates the efficacy, acceptability, and economic impact of a probiotic capsule and a prebiotic cereal intervention in adults with pre-diabetes on metabolic and mental health and well-being outcomes.Eligible adults (n = 152) aged 18-80 years with pre-diabetes (glycated haemoglobin 41-49 mmol/mol) will be enrolled in a 2 × 2 factorial design, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. Computer-generated block randomization will be performed independently. Interventions are capsulated Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (6 × 10 colony-forming units/day) (A) and cereal containing 4 g β-glucan (), placebo capsules (O), and calorie-matched control cereal (O). Eligible participants will receive 6 months intervention in the following groups: AB, AO, BO, and OO. The primary outcome is glycated haemoglobin after 6 months. Follow-up at 9 months will assess the durability of response. Secondary outcomes are glycated haemoglobin after 3 and 9 months, fasting glucose, , blood pressure, body weight, body mass index, and blood lipid levels. General well-being and quality of life will be measured by the Short-Form Health Survey 36 and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 at 6 and 9 months.

The basal circulating levels of total GLP-1 and resistin along with serum , glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured. : Plasma GLP-1 and serum resistin levels were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients than controls ( < . 001). Moreover, circulating GLP-1 and resistin levels increased in a stepwise fashion in line with increasing grade of liver damage. According to Spearman's rank correlation, both GLP-1 and resisitin correlated positively with each other, , homeostatic model assessment of , alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, and international normalized ratio while they correlated negatively with albumin ( < .001).

Recent data suggest that alterations in DNA methylation may be related to NAFLD pathogenesis and progression and we have previously shown that dynamic changes in the cell lineage identifier 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) may be important in the pathogenesis of liver disease. We used a model of diet-induced obesity, maintaining male mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) to generate hepatic steatosis. We profiled hepatic gene expression, global and locus-specific 5hmC and additionally investigated the effects of weight loss on the phenotype. HFD led to increased weight gain, fasting hyperglycaemia, glucose intolerance,  and hepatic periportal macrovesicular steatosis. Diet-induced hepatic steatosis associated with reversible 5hmC changes at a discrete number of functionally important genes. We propose that 5hmC profiles are a useful signature of gene transcription and a marker of cell state in NAFLD and suggest that 5hmC profiles hold potential as a biomarker of abnormal liver physiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474632>[Role of Angiogenesis and Chronic Inflammation in Fat Hypertrophy in NASH Pathology].</a></h2><p>Tissue expansion and chronic inflammation in adipose tissue (AT) are closely related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathology. Angiogenesis is initiated by the detachment of pericytes (PCs) from vessels in AT. This process is necessary for the development of AT in obesity. The detachment is caused by excessive platelet-derived growth factor  (PDGF-) derived from M1-macrophages (Mφ) infiltrating obese AT. On the other hand, AT of tamoxifen-induced systemic PDGF receptor-β knockout mice showed decreased detachment of PCs from vessels in obesity, thereby attenuating hypertrophy of AT mediated by neoangiogenesis, resulting in protection from the development of chronic AT inflammation and systemic . The selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibitor eplerenone (Ep) suppresses chronic inflammation in fat and the liver, improves glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibits body weight and fat mass gain in mice fed a high-fat diet. As a novel mechanism, Ep increases energy expenditure and suppresses fat accumulation, thereby controlling the polarity of visceral AT Mφ from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 dominant. In addition, Ep directly inhibits the activation of signals 1 and 2 of NLRP3-inflammasomes in Mφ, which is an inflammatory mechanism closely involved in the development of NASH. Thus, we propose novel therapeutic approaches to NASH. Inhibition of PDGF receptor-β signaling prevents AT hypertrophy by regulating AT angiogenesis, and MR inhibitors directly suppress chronic inflammation in the AT and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620350>Metabolic profile and prolactin serum levels in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus: Old-new rubric.</a></h2><p>Prolactin (PRL) is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism since high PRL serum levels are associated with low incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the metabolic effects of PRL on glucose homeostasis in men with T2DM.Eighty male patients with T2DM compared with 25 male healthy controls matched with patients for age and weight were divided into four groups: Group (A): patients with T2DM on metformin ( = 29), Group (): patients with T2DM on glyburide ( = 30), Group (C): patients with T2DM on glyburide plus metformin ( = 21), and Group (D): healthy male subjects as control ( = 25).

Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, atherogenic index, fasting serum ,  (IR), and β-cell function of the pancreas were determined by homeostatic model assessment-2 (HOMA-IR). Furthermore, C-reactive protein and PRL serum level were determined in patients with T2DM and healthy control men.BMI of T2DM patients was higher as compared with control ( = 0.003). Combination therapy (glyburide plus metformin) in patients with T2DM showed better effect on most of glycemic indices and lipid profile than glyburide or metformin monotherapy ( < 0.05). PRL serum level was higher in patients with T2DM as compared with control ( = 0.001). PRL serum level was high in glyburide-treated patients as compared with metformin-treated patients ( = 0.002).This study concludes that elevated PRL serum level in patients with T2DM is associated with diabetic complications.

We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, 1H-indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indole acrylic acid and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic acid, l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved  mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and  was observed.

Protein kinase /Akt plays a prominent role in mediating many of the metabolic effects of . Mice and humans harboring systemic loss-of-function mutations in Akt2, the most abundant Akt isoform in metabolic tissues, are glucose intolerant and  resistant. Since the skeletal muscle accounts for a significant amount of postprandial glucose disposal, a popular hypothesis in the diabetes field suggests that a reduction in Akt, specifically in skeletal muscle, leads to systemic glucose intolerance and . Despite this common belief, the specific role of skeletal muscle Akt in muscle growth and  sensitivity remains undefined.We generated multiple mouse models of skeletal muscle Akt deficiency to evaluate the role of muscle Akt signaling in vivo. The effects of these genetic perturbations on muscle mass, glucose homeostasis and  sensitivity were assessed using both in vivo and ex vivo assays.Surprisingly, mice lacking Akt2 alone in skeletal muscle displayed normal skeletal muscle  signaling, glucose tolerance, and  sensitivity despite a dramatic reduction in phosphorylated Akt. In contrast, deletion of both Akt isoforms (M-AktDKO) prevented downstream signaling and resulted in muscle atrophy. Despite the absence of Akt signaling, in vivo and ex vivo -stimulated glucose uptake were normal in M-AktDKO mice. Similar effects on  sensitivity were observed in mice with prolonged deletion (4 weeks) of both skeletal muscle Akt isoforms selectively in adulthood. Conversely, short term deletion (2 weeks) of skeletal muscle specific Akt in adult muscles impaired  tolerance paralleling the effect observed by acute pharmacological inhibition of Akt in vitro. Mechanistically, chronic ablation of Akt induced mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of AMPK, which was required for -stimulated glucose uptake in the absence of Akt.Together, these data indicate that chronic reduction in Akt activity alone in skeletal muscle is not sufficient to induce  or prevent glucose uptake in all conditions. Therefore, since -stimulated glucose disposal in skeletal muscle is markedly impaired in -resistant states, we hypothesize that alterations in signaling molecules in addition to skeletal muscle Akt are necessary to perturb glucose tolerance and  sensitivity in vivo.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

To date, limited studies have investigated the effect of extruded products of whole grains on the  signaling pathway in vivo. This study investigated the effects of oral consumption of whole grain extrudate, including 97% brown rice and 3% defatted rice bran (w/w, BRD), on glucose metabolism and the hepatic  signaling pathway in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. BRD treatment induced a remarkable reduction in blood glucose. Moreover, glucose intolerance and  were ameliorated in the BRD-treated group compared with those in the db/db control group. BRD also increased the hepatic glycogen content by reducing the expression and increasing the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). The activities of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and their respective mRNA expression levels in the liver were simultaneously decreased in the BRD-treated group. BRD also significantly upregulated the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and increased the phosphorylation of  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and protein kinase  (AKT). These results indicate that BRD exhibits antidiabetic potential by activating the IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, further regulating the expression of the  gene and p-GSK3β protein, thus inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis, increasing hepatic glycogen storage, and improving .

Our aim was to assess the shift in the prevalence of different liver disease aetiologies in the USA over the past three decades.National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES; cross-sectional 1988-1994 and 1999-2016) were used.A total of 58 731 adults from NHANES (1988-2016) were included. Over the study period, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis  and alcoholic liver disease remained stable: 0.3%-0.4% and 0.8%-1.0%, respectively (p>0.05). The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C decreased nearly twofold: 1.6% in 1988-1994 to 0.9% in 2013-2016 (p=0.03). In contrast, the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; by US-Fatty Liver Index) increased from 20.0% (1988-1994) to 28.3% (1999-2004) to 33.2% (2009-2012) and 31.9% (2013-2016) (p<0.0001). Furthermore, steady increases were observed in the rates of obesity (22.2% in 1988-1994 to 31.0% in 1999-2004 to 38.9% in 2013-2016), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (from 7.2% to 8.2% to 13.5% same years),  and hypertension (all p<0.0001). Yearly trend analyses showed that the only LD with consistently increasing prevalence was NAFLD (trend p=0.01).

Our previous study shows that dietary β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) improves lipid metabolism in a pig model. However, it remains unclear whether HMB blocks obesity through gut microbiota. In this study, we found that HMB reduced body weight, alleviated the whitening of brown adipose tissue, and improved  in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD).

Moreover, microbiota transplantation from HMB-treated mice attenuated HFD-induced lipid metabolic disorders. Furthermore, HFD-fed mice showed lower short-chain fatty acids, whereas administration of HMB increased the propionic acid production. Correlation analysis identified a significant correlation between propionic acid production and the relative  abundance. Sodium propionate treatment also attenuated HFD-induced lipid metabolic disorders. Collectively, our results indicated that HMB might be used as a probiotic agent to reverse HFD-induced obesity, and the potential mechanism was associated with reprogramming gut microbiota and metabolism, especially -mediated propionic acid production.

This study assessed the expression of complement components in the kidneys of rats with type 2 DN to investigate their role in DN.  A rat model of type 2 DN was induced by a high-fat diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin. Blood glucose, fasting  levels,  index, and 24-h urinary albumin excretion (UAE) were measured. Renal tissue morphological features were observed. The mesangial index and arteriosclerosis index were calculated. Immunohistochemistry and western blot were used to measure the expression of complement components in the kidneys.  The kidney weight: body weight (mg/g) ratio in the DN group was significantly greater than those in the control and diabetes mellitus (DM) groups. The arteriosclerosis index, mesangial index, and tube area percentage in the DN group were significantly higher than those in the control and DM groups, but these parameters did not significantly differ between the control and DM groups. The expression of the complement components C1q, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease (MASP)-2,  factor, C3, and C5b-9 in the DN group was significantly higher than that in the control and DM groups but did not significantly differ between the control and DM groups. Most of the complement components were mainly expressed at the renal tubular site. Correlation analysis showed that 24-h UAE were positively correlated with C1q, MBL, MASP-2,  factor, and C5b-9 expression. MI was positively correlated with MBL,  factor, C3, and C5b-9 expression. AI was positively correlated with C1q, MBL, MASP-2, and  factor expression.  Complement components including C1q, MBL, MASP-2,  factor, C3, and C5b-9, were highly expressed in the kidneys of type 2 diabetic rats with DN. Most of the complement components were mainly expressed in the renal tubules. High expression of complement components was found to be associated with the progress of DN.

In this study, we evaluated ability of pterostilbene (PTS), a methoxylated analogue of resveratrol and a known antioxidant, to reverse palmitic acid (PA)-mediated IR in HepG2 cells. PTS prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and subsequent oxidative lipid damage by reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3) in PA treated HepG2 cells. Hepatic glucose production was used as a measure of IR and PTS reversed PA-mediated increase in hepatic glucose production by reducing expression of genes coding for gluconeogenic enzymes namely glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC); and their transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and fork head class Box O (FOXO1) along with its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 α (PGC1α). PTS reversed PA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which in turn altered  signalling pathway by phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser 307, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β. PTS also reduced PA-mediated lipid accumulation by reducing expression of transcription factors SREBP1c and PPARα. SREBP1c activates genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis while PPARα activates CPT1, a rate limiting enzyme for controlling entry and oxidation of fatty acids into mitochondria. PTS, however, did not influence PA uptake confirmed by using BODIPY-labelled fluorescent C16 fatty acid analogue. Thus, our data provides a possible mechanistic explanation for reversal of PA-mediated IR in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31232102>Effects of acute sprint interval exercise on follistatin-like 1 and apelin secretions.</a></h2><p>  is the main triggering factor for type 2 diabetes. Recently, it has been reported that high-intensity sprint interval training (SIT) was effective for improving glucose metabolism and  sensitivity despite lower training volume. However, the mechanisms underlying the SIT-induced increases in glucose metabolism and  sensitivity have not been well-understood. Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) and apelin, which are novel myokines, have a favourable effect on glucose metabolism.  We examined the impact of acute SIT on FSTL1 and apelin secretions.  Eight healthy men were enrolled in this study. The subjects performed acute SIT consisting of four 30-s all-out cycling efforts with 4-min rest periods. Blood samples were obtained before and after the acute SIT to measure FSTL1 and apelin concentrations.  FSTL1 and apelin both significantly increased following acute SIT.  Acute SIT may be an effective stimulus for increasing of FSTL1 and apelin secretions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208077>Genome-Wide Profiling of Laron Syndrome Patients Identifies Novel Cancer Protection Pathways.</a></h2><p>Laron syndrome (LS), or primary growth hormone , is a prototypical congenital -like growth factor 1 (IGF1) deficiency.

Our aim was to investigate whether liraglutide treatment can inhibit HCV replication. A cell culture-produced HCV infectious system was generated by transfection of in vitro-transcribed genomic JFH-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) into Huh-7.5 cells. Total RNA samples were extracted to determine the efficiency of HCV replication. The Ava5 cells were treated with liraglutide and cell viability was calculated. A Western blot analysis of the protein expression was performed. The immunoreactive blot signals were also detected. Liraglutide activated GLP-1 receptors in the HCV infectious system, and inhibited subgenomic HCV RNA replication in the HuH-7.5 cells. The Western blot analysis revealed both HCV protein and replicon RNA were reduced after treatment with liraglutide in a dose-dependent manner. Liraglutide decreased the cell viability of HCV RNA at an optimum concentration of 120 μg/mL, activated the 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the phosphorylated- transducer of regulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) response element-binding protein 2 (TORC2), thereby decreasing the cell viability of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and G6pase RNA Therefore, we conclude that liraglutide can inhibit HCV replication via an AMPK/TORC2-dependent pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271198>Lifestyle intervention modifies the effect of the MC4R genotype on changes in  among women with prior gestational diabetes: Tianjin Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Prevention Program.</a></h2><p>A history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has been related to an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes.

It is believed that long-term high  stimulation might facilitate  in the liver, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Herein, we report that hyperinsulinemia could induce persistent early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) activation in hepatocytes, which provides negative feedback inhibition of  sensitivity by inducing the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B). Deletion of Egr-1 in the liver remarkably decreases glucose production, thus improving systemic glucose tolerance and  sensitivity.

Given that approximately 50% of pregnancies are unplanned, alcohol has the potential to affect fetal development and program chronic disease in offspring. We examined the effect of an acute but moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on glucose metabolism, lipid levels and dietary preference in adolescent and/or adult rat offspring. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received an oral gavage of ethanol (1 g kg maternal body weight, n = 9 dams) or an equivalent volume of saline (control, n = 8 dams) at embryonic days 13.5 and 14.5. PAE resulted in a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05-0.06% 1 h post-gavage in dams. Fasting blood glucose concentration was not affected by PAE in offspring at any age, nor were blood glucose levels during a glucose tolerance test (GTT) in 6-month old offspring (P > 0.5). However, there was evidence of  in PAE male offspring at 6 months of age, with significantly elevated fasting plasma  (P = 0.001), a tendency for increased first phase  secretion during the GTT and impaired glucose clearance following an  challenge (P = 0.007). This was accompanied by modest alterations in protein kinase  (AKT) signalling in adipose tissue. PAE also resulted in reduced calorie consumption by offspring compared to controls (P = 0.04). These data suggest that a relatively low-level, acute PAE programs metabolic dysfunction in offspring in a sex-specific manner.

A series of reactions are involved in this process, including increased release of proinflammatory cytokines, and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) receptors. Among the therapeutic tools available nowadays, physical exercise (PE) has a known hypoglycemic effect explained by complex molecular mechanisms, including an increase in  receptor phosphorylation, in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, in the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) pathway, with subsequent activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), Rac1, TBC1 domain family member 1 and 4 (TBC1D1 and TBC1D4), in addition to a variety of signaling molecules, such as GTPases, Rab and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attached protein receptor (SNARE) proteins. These pathways promote greater translocation of GLUT4 and consequent glucose uptake by the skeletal muscle. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK), atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and some of its isoforms, such as PKC-iota/lambda also seem to play a fundamental role in the transport of glucose. In this sense, the association between autophagy and exercise has also demonstrated a relevant role in the uptake of muscle glucose. , in turn, uses a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism, while exercise signal may be triggered by the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

However, both biomarkers need further validation, and the interactions between them for optimal weight management are largely unknown. To investigate differences in weight loss maintenance between subjects with low and high P/ ratio and the potential interactions with markers of glucose metabolism and dietary fiber intake.Following an 8-week weight loss period using meal replacement products, subjects losing ≥ 8% of their initial body weight were randomized to one of three protein supplements or maltodextrin for a 24-week weight maintenance period. Habitual diet was consumed along with the supplements expected to constitute 10-15% of total energy. For this analysis we stratified the participants into low and high strata based on median values of pre-intervention P/ ratio, pre-weight loss Homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) (<2.33 or > 2.33), and dietary fiber intake during the intervention (< 28.5 or > 28.5 g/10 MJ).Regardless of weight maintenance regimen, subjects with high P/ ratio (n = 63) regained 1.5 (95% CI 0.4, 2.7) kg body weight (P = 0.007) more than subjects with low P/ ratio (n = 63). The regain among subjects with high P/ ratio was particular evident if HOMA-IR was high and dietary fiber intake was low. Consequently, in the high P/ strata, subjects with high HOMA-IR and low fiber intake (n = 17) regained 5.3 (95% CI 3.3, 7.3) kg (P < 0.001) more body weight compared with participants with low HOMA-IR and high fiber intake (n = 16).Subjects with high P/ ratio were more susceptible to regain body weight compared with subjects with low P/ ratio, especially when dietary fiber intake was low and glucose metabolism was impaired.

PCA significantly and dose-dependently attenuated DEX-induced a) glucose intolerance (↓ AUC), ) hyperglycemia (↓ fasting blood glucose), c) impaired  sensitivity [↓fasting plasma  and homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) index)] and d) dyslipidemia (↓total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol). PCA mitigated DEX-induced liver steatosis with associated reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity. Moreover, PCA ameliorated DEX-induced vascular dysfunction and enhanced ACh-induced relaxation in aortic rings. The metabolic ameliorating effects of PCA might be attributed to the enhanced  signaling in soleus muscles (↑AKT phosphorylation) and mitigating gluconeogenesis (↓ hepatic mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). The vasculoprotective effect of PCA might be related to its ability to restore normal mRNA expression of [endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4)]. PCA restored normal oxidative balance [↓ oxidant species, malondialdehyde (MDA) and (↑ antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD)]. The findings herein reveal for the first time that PCA may be taken as a supplement with GCs to limit their metabolic and vascular side effects through its hypoglycemic, -sensitizing, hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Although several studies have been reported for potential molecular mechanisms, relevant genes or mutated sites have not been intensively investigated in China.  In the present study, 218 pregnant mothers (GDM group: 103 individuals and control group: 115 individuals) in China were enrolled to conduct genome-wide association study (GWAS) and pathway analyses for the purpose of related genes associated with GDM in China.  Our results identified 23 SNPs exhibiting closely association with GDM using multiple tests. Annotation of these 23 SNPs identified four genes (, , , and ), which suggests that the four genes may associate with GDM. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis showed that gene , , and  were enriched or located into the pathways or process associated with glycometabolism (e.g.  and glucose tolerance), which further indicates that the three genes may associate with the GDM.  The identification of these potential genes associating with GDM enriched the potential molecular mechanisms of GDM in Asia and will provide abundant stocks for subsequent clinical verifications for better understanding the molecular mechanisms, diagnosis, drug development and clinical treatment of GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284258>[Early neuropathy. Importance of neurophysiological assessment in cases of metabolic syndrome with or without hyperglycemia].</a></h2><p>Peripheral and autonomic neuropathies are one of the major complications in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Nerve lesion starts in an early stage. In patients with DM II the above-mentioned lesion starts even before glycemic dysregulation and during the metabolic syndrome stage. In the beginning, the neuropathy may be asymptomatic; therefore, neurophysiologic examination should be conducted for its early detection so that therapeutic measures can be taken on time. Nine patients with early neuropathy were here assessed: three of them with metabolic syndrome and fasting hyperglycemia, one with metabolic syndrome without hyperglycemia and five with glycemic dysregulation without metabolic syndrome. All were asymptomatic and neurologic examination was unremarkable. Techniques for the detection of early neuropathy were carried out (sural/radial ratio, F-waves, H-reflex, sympathetic skin responses, cutaneous silent period and heart rate variability reflexes). Eight patients had an early cardiac autonomic neuropathy, one had a definite autonomic neuropathy. Eight patients had an early somatic neuropathy (seven with a sural/radial ratio < 0.5 and one with abnormal F-waves), and one had an asymptomatic small-fiber neuropathy (abnormal sympathetic skin responses and cutaneous silent period). Detection of early neuropathy through neurophysiology is mandatory before clinical signs and symptoms appear, during this stage, effective therapeutic measures can be warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179345>Distinct Effects of Carrageenan and High-Fat Consumption on the Mechanisms of  in Nonobese and Obese Models of Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Exposure to low concentration of the common food additive carrageenan (10 mg/L) for only six days led to glucose intolerance and  in the C57BL/6J mouse. Longer exposure produced fasting hyperglycemia but with no increase in weight, in contrast to the HFD. Glucose intolerance was attributable to carrageenan-induced inflammation and to increased expression of GRB10. Both HFD and carrageenan increased p(Ser32)-I and p(Ser307)-IRS1, and the increases were greater following the combined exposure. The effects of carrageenan were inhibited by the combination of the free radical inhibitor Tempol and BCL10 siRNA, which had no impact on the HFD-mediated increase. In contrast, the PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin blocked the HFD-induced increases, without an effect on the carrageenan-mediated effects. HFD had no impact on the expression of GRB10. Both carrageenan and high fat increased hepatic infiltration by F4/80-positive macrophages. Serum galectin-3 and galectin-3 binding to the  receptor increased by carrageenan and by HFD. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the  receptor declined following either exposure and was further reduced by their combination. Carrageenan reduced the activity of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (ARSB; arylsulfatase ), which was unchanged following HFD. Dietary exposure to both high fat and carrageenan can impair  signaling through both similar and distinct mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31173318>Correlations of acute myocardial infarction complicated by cerebral infarction with , adiponectin and HMGB1.</a></h2><p>To investigate the correlations of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cerebral infarction with , adiponectin and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1).A total of 326 AMI patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were selected as the research objects. They were divided into cerebral infarction group (n=24) and non-cerebral infarction group (n=302) based on their complication of cerebral infarction. In addition, 165 healthy people were enrolled as control group. Changes in the levels of HMGB1, adiponectin, fasting  (FINS),  sensitive index (ISI), , N-terminal pro--type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), myocardial infarction markers and coagulation function indexes were compared among the three groups.

Conversely, levels of adiponectin, myoglobin (Mb), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), antithrombin III (AT-III), activated coagulation time (ACT) and NT-proBNP were the lowest in cerebral infarction group, and highest in control group (p<0.05). AMI complicated with cerebral infarction was negatively correlated with the levels of AT-III and adiponectin, but positively associated with the levels of NT-proBNP, HOMA-IR and HMGB1 (p<0.05).AMI complicated with cerebral infarction has negative correlations with the levels of AT-III and adiponectin, but positively associated with the levels of NT-proBNP, HOMA-IR and HMGB1, possessing certain clinical significance in AMI treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181824>Impact of Percent Body Fat on All-Cause Mortality among Adequate Dialysis Patients with and without : A Multi-Center Prospective Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>The association between body fat and mortality in hemodialysis patients remains controversial. We examined the effect of percent body fat (PBF) on all-cause mortality among adequate hemodialysis patients with and without  (IR). A prospective cohort study was conducted on 365 adequate hemodialysis patients (equilibrated Kt/V ≥ 1.2) from seven hospitals. Patients' characteristics and clinical and biochemical parameters were assessed at baseline between September 2013 and April 2017. Patients were followed up for all-cause mortality until April 2018. The median value of homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) was used to classify IR. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to examine predictors of all-cause mortality. During 1.4 (1.0-3.2) years of follow-up, 46 patients died. In patients with IR (HOMA-IR ≥ 5.18), PBF was significantly higher in the survival group than in the death group (31.3 ± 9.0 vs. 25.4 ± 8.2,  = 0.005). After controlling for confounding factors, PBF was significantly associated with lower risk for all-cause mortality in patients with IR (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-1.00;  = 0.033). The association was not observed in patients without IR.

However, the small sample size of the available studies, presence of comorbidities, heterogeneity of the subjects examined represented major weaknesses not allowing to draw definite conclusions. This is the case for the overweight state. The present meta-analysis evaluated 1438 obese or overweight subjects recruited in 45 microneurographic studies. The analysis was primarily based on MSNA quantification in obesity and overweight, excluding as concomitant conditions hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and other comorbidities. Assessment was extended to the relationships of MSNA with other neuroadrenergic markers, such as plasma norepinephrine and heart rate, anthropometric variables, as body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, presence/absence of obstructive sleep apnea, and metabolic profile. Compared with normoweights MSNA was significantly greater in overweight and more in obese individuals (37.0±4.1 versus 43.2±3.5 and 50.4±5.0 burts/100 heartbeats, P<0.01). This was the case even in the absence of obstructive sleep apnea. MSNA was significantly directly related to body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio ( r=0.41 and r=0.64, P<0.04 and <0.01, respectively), clinic blood pressure ( r=0.68, P<0.01), total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, and triglycerides ( r=0.91, r=0.94, and r=0.80, respectively, P<0.01) but unrelated to plasma , glucose, and homeostatic model assessment for . No significant correlation was found between MSNA, heart rate, and norepinephrine. Thus, obesity and overweight are characterized by sympathetic overactivity which mirrors the severity of the clinical condition and reflects metabolic alterations, with the exclusion of glucose/ profile. Neither heart rate nor norepinephrine appear to represent faithful markers of the muscle sympathetic overdrive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672472>Isoflurane aggravates peripheral and central  in high-fat diet/streptozocin-induced type 2 diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>Isoflurane anesthesia is reported to induce  (IR) in the peripheral tissues. However, researches on the impact of isoflurane on -related metabolism in the central nervous system, especially in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are scarce. This study sought to explore whether isoflurane anesthesia had a negative effect on  sensitivity both in peripheral and central tissues. Moreover, the possible role of isoflurane anesthesia in T2DM mice with pre-existing IR was analyzed. T2DM model in C57BL/6J mice was established by high fat diet (HFD) and single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Both HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice and normal mice received 6 h isoflurane exposure. Blood glucose level and serum  concentration were detected and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated to estimate peripheral IR. Relative levels of genes and proteins in the -dependent signaling pathway in mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined to measure central IR. Results indicated that 6 h isoflurane exposure induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and raised HOMA-IR index. Meanwhile, phosphorylated  receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) (Ser639) and phosphorylated  receptor substrate-2 (pIRS2) (Ser731) were upregulated, while phosphorylated protein kinase  (pAKT) (Ser473) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (pGSK3β) (Ser9) were downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of anesthetized mice. Notably, isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravated the degree of central IR in the aspects of gene transcriptions and protein expressions in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice with pre-existing IR. This study suggested that isoflurane anesthesia induced peripheral and central IR and aggravated pre-existing  in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019.

A previous study reported that atherosclerotic plaques were found in 45.2% of young adults FDR of T2DM, but the study did not include non-FDR as control group. The aim of this study was to compare subclinical atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness, CIMT) between FDR of T2DM and non-FDR.  This was a cross-sectional study involving 16 FDR subjects and 16 age-sex matched non-FDR subjects, aged 19-40 years, with normal glucose tolerance and no hypertension. Collected data included demographic characteristic, anthropometric measurement (BMI and waist circumference), laboratory analysis (fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile), and CIMT examination (using -mode ultrasound).  The mean of CIMT in the FDR group was higher than that in the non-FDR group (0.44 mm vs 0.38 mm, =0.005). After adjusting for waist circumference, BMI, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride, CIMT maintained significant difference between FDR and non-FDR subjects.

Interleukin-29 (IL-29), a member of type 3 interferon family, plays a role in host defenses against microbes, however, little is known about its role in metabolic disorders. We explored the function of IL-29 in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced inflammation and . We found that serum IL-29 level was significantly higher in obese patients. IL-29 upregulated IL-1β, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and decreased glucose uptake and  sensitivity in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes through reducing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and AKT signals. In addition, IL-29 promoted monocyte/macrophage migration. Inhibition of IL-29 could reduce inflammatory cytokine production in macrophage-adipocyte coculture system, which mimic an obese microenvironment. In vivo, IL-29 reduced  sensitivity and increased the number of peritoneal macrophages in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. IL-29 increased M1/M2 macrophage ratio and enhanced MCP-1 expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. Therefore, we have identified a critical role of IL-29 in obesity-induced inflammation and , and we conclude that IL-29 may be a novel candidate target for treating obesity and  in patients with metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31367840>Changes of Blood-Brain Barrier and Brain Parenchymal Protein Expression Levels of Mice under Different  Conditions Induced by High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate changes of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain parenchymal protein expression due to type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) by using SWATH-based quantitative proteomics.Mice were fed a HFD for 2 or 10 weeks, and then SWATH-based quantitative proteomic analysis, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and functional transport studies were performed.In brain capillaries, expression levels of BBB transporters (Glut1, P-glycoprotein) and tight-junction proteins (claudin-5, occludin) were significantly reduced in HFD mice at 2 weeks, but recovered to the levels in the normal diet (ND) group at 10 weeks.

The aims of this study were to investigate the association between IR and level of fatty liver, and to identify the group at a greater risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis using transient elastography and other noninvasive fibrosis markers.

MicroRNAs (miRs) may be a potential candidate for treatment of GDM. Herein, we suggested that miR-351 could be an inhibitor in the progression of GDM via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase  (PI3K/AKT) pathway. Microarray analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes and predict miRs regulating flotillin 2 (FLOT2). Target relationship between miR-351 and FLOT2 was verified. Gestational diabetes mellitus mice were treated with a series of mimic, inhibitor and small interfering RNA to explore the effect of miR-351 on  (IR), cell apoptosis in pancreatic tissues and liver gluconeogenesis through evaluating GDM-related biochemical indexes, as well as expression of miR-351, FLOT2, PI3K/AKT pathway-, IR- and liver gluconeogenesis-related genes. MiR-351 and FLOT2 were reported to be involved in GDM. FLOT2 was the target gene of miR-351. Gestational diabetes mellitus mice exhibited IR and liver gluconeogenesis, up-regulated FLOT2, activated PI3K/AKT pathway and down-regulated miR-351 in liver tissues. Additionally, miR-351 overexpression and FLOT2 silencing decreased the levels of FLOT2, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fasting blood glucose, fasting , total cholesterol, triglyceride, glyeosylated haemoglobin and homeostasis model of assessment for IR index (HOMA-IR), extent of PI3K and AKT phosphorylation, yet increased the levels of HOMA for islet β-cell function, HOMA for  sensitivity index and glucose transporter 2 expression, indicating reduced cell apoptosis in pancreatic tissues and alleviated IR and liver gluconeogenesis. Our results reveal that up-regulation of miR-351 protects against IR and liver gluconeogenesis by repressing the PI3K/AKT pathway through regulating FLOT2 in GDM mice, which identifies miR-351 as a potential therapeutic target for the clinical management of GDM.© 2018 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164926>Liraglutide improves the beta-cell function without increasing  secretion during a mixed meal in patients, who exhibit well-controlled type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease.</a></h2><p>Hyperinsulinemia aggravates  and cardio-vascular disease.

Despite recent developments in congenital adrenal hyperplasia -21OH D (CAH), several issues related to patient growth and final height remain unsolved. Debate still exist about the safety of long-term use of PD versus HC for treating children with CAH. The mechanism by which glucocorticoid therapy interferes with growth is complex and multifactorial. Relatively slight supra-physiologic levels may be enough to blunt growth velocity. An increased risk of developing obesity is another possible consequence of hyper-cortisolism in children with CAH.To evaluate the anthropometric and biochemical effects of long-term PD versus HC treatment in children with CAH-21OHD. A brief review of the literature is also reported.This retrospective study evaluated linear growth and biochemical data of thirty children with classic CAH (19 females and 11 males), who were on PD (n=22) or HC (n=8) treatment, since their first diagnosis. Clinical data included age, gender, duration of therapy, dose of HC and or equivalent dose of HC in the PD group, blood pressure, height (Ht) and weight. Ht-SDS and BMI were also calculated. Biochemical data included measurement of 17- OH progesterone, cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), HDL, LDL, fasting glucose, and  concentrations. HOMA-IR was calculated. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured using high-resolution -mode ultrasonography. Thirty normal age matched children were used as controls for the anthropometric and CIMT data.The age of children and duration of treatment did not differ among the two treatment groups. After a mean of 6 years of treatment, the Ht-SDS and BMI did not differ between the three groups of children. The equivalent hydrocortisone dose of children on prednisone was significantly higher than the dose for the hydrocortisone group. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) of children on PD was slightly higher compared to those on hydrocortisone group. However, the BP of the 2 treatment groups was not different compared to control children. Fasting blood glucose, homeostatic model assessment  (HOMA-IR), plasma TG, HDL, and cholesterol did not differ among the two treatment groups. LDL levels were significantly higher in the PD group versus the HC group. The mean CIMT did not differ among the two treatment groups but was significantly higher in the treated groups versus controls. There was a significant linear correlation between BMI-SDS and CIMT (r=0.37, p=0.047).Children with CAH-21OHD who were kept on PD therapy for 6.4±2.7 years, since the beginning of diagnosis, have maintained normal linear growth. No difference in BMI, HOMA-IR, or CIMT was detected among the two treated groups. The efficiency, safety and convenience of a single daily dose of PD could be a good and relatively safe alternative to HC for the continuing medical treatment of patients with CAH-21OHD.

The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis  or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, , glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603885>Berberine attenuates olanzapine induced-metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>To elucidate the protective effect of berberine on olanzapine induced-metabolic syndrome.This prospective experimental study involved thirty Sprague-Dawley male rats which were divided into three groups.

Activation of  and its binding to the receptor for signaling process initiates via -chain C-terminal hinge conformational change through an open structure to "wide-open" conformation. Observational studies and basic scientific evidence suggest that vitamin D and E directly and/or indirectly prevent diabetes through improving glucose secretion and tolerance, activating calcium dependent endopeptidases and thus improving  exocytosis, antioxidant effect and reducing . On the contrary, clinical trials have yielded inconsistent results about the efficacy of vitamin D supplementations for the control of glucose hemostasis. In this work, best binding modes of vitamin D and E on  obtained from AutoDock Vina were selected for Molecular Dynamic, MD, study. The binding energy obtained from Molecular Mechanics- Poisson Boltzman Surface Area, MM-PBSA method, revealed that Vitamins D and E have good affinity to bind to the  and vitamin E has higher binding energy (-46 kj/mol) by engaging more residues in binding site. Distance and angle calculation results illustrated that vitamin E changes the -chain conformation and it causes the formation of wide-open/active form of . Vitamin E increases the Val-Tyr distance to ∼15 Å and changes the hinge angle to ∼65°. Consequently, essential hydrophobic residues for binding to  receptor exposed to surface in the presence of vitamin E. However, our data illustrated that vitamin D cannot change -chain conformation. Thus our MD simulations propose a model for  activation through vitamin E interaction for therapeutic approaches.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The possible association between cancer and cognitive impairment is important to elucidate, because it can have a serious impact on quality of life. Here, we focused on glucose metabolism as a factor that links cancer and cognitive impairment.Thirteen subjects with solid cancers and cognitive impairment were recruited. As a control group, 14 subjects with cognitive impairment alone and 8 subjects with cancer alone were recruited. A Homeostatic Model Assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and that of β-cell function (HOMA-) were used. In comparison with patients with solid cancer alone, those with cognitive impairment alone and those with both cancer and cognitive impairment had increased HOMA-IR values.  was increased in patients with cognitive impairment alone and those with both cognitive impairment and solid cancer than in patients without cognitive impairment; however, β-cell function was not affected.

DM is characterized by the elevation of blood glucose due either to a defect in  synthesis, secretion, binding to receptor, or an increase of . The internal and external factors such as obesity, urbanizations, and genetic mutations could increase the risk of developing DM. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds existing as secondary metabolites in fruits and vegetables as well as fungi. Their structure consists of 15 carbon skeletons and two aromatic rings (A and ) connected by three carbon chains. Flavonoids are furtherly classified into 6 subclasses: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, flavanols, and anthocyanidins. Naturally occurring flavonoids possess anti-diabetic effects. As in vitro and animal model's studies demonstrate, they have the ability to prevent diabetes and its complications. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge addressing the antidiabetic effects of dietary flavonoids and their underlying molecular mechanisms on selected pathways: Glucose transporter, hepatic enzymes, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AMPK, PPAR, and NF-κ. Flavonoids improve the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications through the regulation of glucose metabolism, hepatic enzymes activities, and a lipid profile. Most studies illustrate a positive role of specific dietary flavonoids on diabetes, but the mechanisms of action and the side effects need more clarification. Overall, more research is needed to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of diabetes treatment using flavonoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404407>Myokine-adipokine cross-talk: potential mechanisms for the association between plasma irisin and adipokines and cardiometabolic risk factors in Mexican children with obesity and the metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Adipokines and the myokine irisin, involved in mechanisms associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS), are understudied in the pediatric population.To investigate the relationship between irisin, and leptin, resistin, adiponectin, adipsin, anthropometric and cardiovascular risk factors in Mexican children.A cross-sample of 126 Mexican children aged 6-12 years old were classified as normal weight (n = 46), obese (n = 40), and MS (n = 40) according to CDC's and Cook's age-modified criteria for obesity and MS. Anthropometric parameters and blood pressure were determined and percentiles calculated for age and gender. Irisin, leptin, adiponectin, adipsin, resistin, triglycerides, glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels, and physical activity were determined. Statistical tests for differences between groups, correlation, and multiple regression analyses were performed.Irisin plasma levels were significantly lower in the obese (6.08 [4.68-6.65]) and MS groups (6.46 [5.74-7.02]) compared with the normal-weight group (8.05 [7.24-8.94]) (p < 0.001). Irisin levels were not influenced by age or gender, but significant dispersion was observed in obese girls (95% CI median [2.29-6.30]). Leptin, resistin, and adipsin levels were significantly increased in the obese and MS groups. Lean-fat ratio was significantly higher in the NW group. Irisin correlated negatively with leptin (- 0.310), resistin (- 0.389), adipsin (- 0.362), BMI% (-0.472), WC% (- 0.453), BMI z-score (- 0.496), fat free mass (- 0.257), fat percentage (- 0.532), fat mass (- 0.515), triglycerides (- 0.291), the number of cardiometabolic risk factors (- 0.443) (p < 0.001); positively with lean-fat ratio (0.489) and HDL-c (0.328) (p < 0.001) and none with physical activity (< 0.001). Following stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, the lean-fat ratio was the only determinant of irisin levels ( = 1.168, p < 0.001).Lean-fat ratio, more than the absolute amount of muscle or fat mass, as well as potential myokine-adipokine cross-talk mechanisms may explain the lower irisin levels in children with obesity and MS, through blunted compensatory responses interfering with tissue-dependent irisin secretion, contributing to a continuous deleterious effect cycle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536476>Exenatide regulates pancreatic islet integrity and  sensitivity in the nonhuman primate baboon Papio hamadryas.</a></h2><p>The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exenatide improves glycemic control by several and not completely understood mechanisms. Herein, we examined the effects of chronic intravenous exenatide infusion on  sensitivity, β cell and α cell function and relative volumes, and islet cell apoptosis and replication in nondiabetic nonhuman primates (baboons). At baseline, baboons received a 2-step hyperglycemic clamp followed by an l-arginine bolus (HC/A). After HC/A, baboons underwent a partial pancreatectomy (tail removal) and received a continuous exenatide (n = 12) or saline (n = 12) infusion for 13 weeks. At the end of treatment, HC/A was repeated, and the remnant pancreas (head-body) was harvested.  sensitivity increased dramatically after exenatide treatment and was accompanied by a decrease in  and C-peptide secretion, while the  secretion/ (disposition) index increased by about 2-fold. β, α, and δ cell relative volumes in exenatide-treated baboons were significantly increased compared with saline-treated controls, primarily as the result of increased islet cell replication. Features of cellular stress and secretory dysfunction were present in islets of saline-treated baboons and absent in islets of exenatide-treated baboons. In conclusion, chronic administration of exenatide exerts proliferative and cytoprotective effects on β, α, and δ cells and produces a robust increase in  sensitivity in nonhuman primates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496777>Linking the metabolic syndrome and obesity with vitamin D status: risks and opportunities for improving cardiometabolic health and well-being.</a></h2><p>The global death toll from noncommunicable diseases is exceptionally high, reported to cause 71% of global deaths worldwide. Metabolic syndrome risk factors, especially excessive adiposity and obesity, are at the heart of the problem resulting in increased co-morbidities such as cardiometabolic diseases and cancer, increased health costs, poorer quality of life, and shortened survival. Vitamin D can positively reverse many of these adverse effects and outcomes through blocking signaling mechanisms that predispose to cardiometabolic and metastatic disease. As an affordable natural agent, vitamin D can be used to counteract obesity-induced inflammation, block early adipogenesis, enhance glucose uptake, counteract hyperleptinemia, ameliorate , and reduce hypertension. This is supported by data from in vitro, in vivo and epidemiological studies and clinical trials. We propose that everyone in general and obese patients in particular consider raising 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels through UVB exposure and/or supplemental vitamin D intake to reduce cardiometabolic and metastatic disease and increase longevity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31264208>High-fat diet reduces novelty-induced expression of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein.</a></h2><p>Chronic high-fat-diet (HFD) consumption can lead to the development of brain , which then exerts deleterious effects on learning and memory. Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) is a memory-related protein, and its expression can be induced by  stimulation. In HFD-fed animals, their basal Arc protein levels in cerebral cortex and hippocampus are reduced. However, the effects of HFD on novelty-induced Arc protein expression that is important for cognitive function is still unknown. In the present study, after feeding HFD (60% kcal from fat) for 5 weeks, mice developed brain  and had a significant reduction in the novelty-induced but not the basal Arc protein levels in their hippocampi. Further experiments were performed in primary rat hippocampal neurons. The results show that, under the condition of neuronal , acute  stimulation induced less activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase /p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (PI3K/Akt/p70S6K) pathway, resulting in reduced induction of Arc protein expression. Accordingly, it is suggested that following HFD feeding, the reduction in novelty-induced Arc protein expression in animal's hippocampus is probably related to a suppressed activation of the PI3K/Akt/p70S6K pathway due to the existence of brain .© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514563>Racial Differences in Cardiovascular Biomarkers in the General Population.</a></h2><p>Background The incidence and clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD) differ between blacks and whites. Biomarkers that reflect important pathophysiological pathways may provide a window to allow deeper understanding of racial differences in CVD. Methods and Results The study included 2635 white and black participants from the Dallas Heart Study who were free from existing CVD. Cross-sectional associations between race and 32 biomarkers were evaluated using multivariable linear regression adjusting for age, traditional CVD risk factors, imaging measures of body composition, renal function, , left ventricular mass, and socioeconomic factors. In fully adjusted models, black women had higher lipoprotein(a), leptin, d-dimer, osteoprotegerin, antinuclear antibody, homoarginine, suppression of tumorigenicity-2, and urinary microalbumin, and lower adiponectin, soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products and N-terminal pro--type natriuretic peptide versus white women. Black men had higher lipoprotein(a), leptin, d-dimer, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibody, symmetrical dimethylarginine, homoarginine, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, suppression of tumorigenicity-2, and lower adiponectin, soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products, and N-terminal pro--type natriuretic peptide versus white men. Adjustment for biomarkers that were associated with higher CVD risk, and that differed between blacks and whites, attenuated the risk for CVD events in black women (unadjusted hazard ratio 2.05, 95% CI 1.32, 3.17 and adjusted hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.69, 1.92) and black men (unadjusted hazard ratio 2.39, 95% CI 1.64, 3.46, and adjusted hazard ratio 1.21, 95% CI 0.76, 1.95). Conclusions Significant racial differences were seen in biomarkers reflecting lipids, adipokines, and biomarkers of endothelial function, inflammation, myocyte injury, and neurohormonal stress, which may contribute to racial differences in the development and complications of CVD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519735> and β-adrenergic receptors mediate lipolytic and anti-lipolytic signalling that is not altered by type 2 diabetes in human adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Control of fatty acid storage and release in adipose tissue is fundamental in energy homeostasis and the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. We here take the whole signalling network into account to identify how  and β-adrenergic stimulation in concert controls lipolysis in mature subcutaneous adipocytes obtained from non-diabetic and, in parallel, type 2 diabetic women. We report that, and show how, the anti-lipolytic effect of  can be fully explained by protein kinase  (PKB/Akt)-dependent activation of the phosphodiesterase PDE3B. Through the same PKB-dependent pathway β-adrenergic receptor signalling, via cAMP and PI3Kα, is anti-lipolytic and inhibits its own stimulation of lipolysis by 50%. Through this pathway both  and β-adrenergic signalling control phosphorylation of FOXO1. The dose-response of lipolysis is bell-shaped, such that  is anti-lipolytic at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations of  lipolysis was increasingly restored due to inhibition of PDE3B. The control of lipolysis was not altered in adipocytes from diabetic individuals. However, the release of fatty acids was increased by 50% in diabetes due to reduced reesterification of lipolytically liberated fatty acids. In conclusion, our results reveal mechanisms of control by  and β-adrenergic stimulation - in human adipocytes - that define a network of checks and balances ensuring robust control to secure uninterrupted supply of fatty acids without reaching concentrations that put cellular integrity at risk. Moreover, our results define how selective  leave lipolytic control by  unaltered in diabetes, while the fatty acid release is substantially increased.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161109>Visceral Adiposity Index: Simple Tool for Assessing Cardiometabolic Risk in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.</a></h2><p>To study visceral adiposity index (VAI) and its association with cardiometabolic risk in different phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).It is a case-control cross-sectional study where 100 reproductive age (18-35 years) women with PCOS were classified in different phenotypes as per Rotterdam criteria and compared with age and Body mass index (BMI) matched 50 eumenorrheic and nonhirsute women. Various anthropometric, clinical, biochemical, and hormonal parameters were measured in both women with PCOS and controls. VAI was calculated using waist circumference (WC), BMI, serum triglyceride, and High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in all the subjects and compared between cases and controls. Subsequently, women with PCOS were assessed for cardiometabolic risk according to androgen excess society statement 2010 as "at risk" and "at high risk." Finally, risk was correlated with VAI for all the phenotypes of PCOS.Mean VAI was significantly higher ( < 0.001) in cases than controls (2.07 vs. 1.27). Mean VAI in phenotype A (O+P+HA),  (O+HA), C (P+HA), and D (O+P) was 2.46, 2.48, 1.47, and 1.70, respectively. A total of 56% of women with PCOS were at risk and 12% at high risk for cardiometabolic disease. Metabolic syndrome was prevalent in 11% of cases and 1% had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Phenotypically, 88% of women with PCOS with phenotype A (O+P+HA), 67% of  (O+HA), 67% of C (P+HA), and 55% of D (O+P) were at increased risk. VAI was found to be positively correlated with WC (r, 0.550), waist to hip ratio (r, 0.295), Homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA IR) (r, 0.455), and cardiometabolic risk (r, 0.399). Also, it was the best factor associated with cardiometabolic risk (area under curve, 0.793).This study concluded that visceral adiposity index can be used as simple and effective tool for assessing the cardiometabolic risk in women with PCOS as higher VAI values were observed in those cases who were at high risk for developing cardiometabolic disorder in future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547311>Anti-Metabolic Syndrome Effects of Fucoidan from  via Reactive Oxygen Species-Mediated Regulation of JNK, Akt, and AMPK Signaling.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have reported that dietary fiber improved metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the effects of fucoidans on MetS were still not clear. In this study, we evaluated the activity of fucoidan from  (FvF) on attenuating MetS and first elucidated the underlying mechanism. In vitro, FvF treatment remarkably lowered the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with the sodium palmitate (PA)-induced  (IR) group. The phosphorylation level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was significantly decreased, while phosphorylation of protein kinase  (pAkt) level increased, compared with that of the HepG2 cells treated with PA. Thus, FvF increased glucose consumption and relieved IR via ROS-mediated JNK and Akt signaling pathways. In addition, these changes were accompanied by the activation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate-ativated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream targets (e.g., HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1C)), which improved lipid metabolism in IR HepG2 cells. In vivo, FvF improved hyperglycemia and decreased serum  level in mice with MetS. Furthermore, we evaluated the inhibition of glucose transport by in vitro (Caco-2 monolayer model), semi-in vivo (everted gut sac model) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which indicated that FvF could significantly reduce the absorption of glucose into the blood stream, thus it could improve blood-glucose levels and IR in mice with MetS. Moreover, FvF decreased serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and liver lipid accumulation, while increased the serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level in mice with MetS. Therefore, FvF could be considered as a potential candidate for the treatment of MetS by alleviating IR, inhibiting glucose transportation, and regulating lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522416>Immunophenotyping of Human  Lymphocytes in Blood and in Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>The human obese subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) contributes to systemic and  cell intrinsic inflammation, reduced  cell responses, and increased secretion of autoimmune antibodies.

However, the metabolomic signature of T2DM in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has not been investigated thus far. In this prospective metabolomic study, fasting CSF and plasma samples from 40 T2DM patients to 36 control subjects undergoing elective surgery with spinal anesthesia were analyzed by H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR spectra of CSF and plasma metabolites were analyzed and correlated with the presence of T2DM and diabetic microangiopathy (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) using an area under the curve (AUC) estimation. CSF metabolomic profiles in T2DM patients vs. controls revealed significantly increased levels of alanine, leucine, valine, tyrosine, lactate, pyruvate, and decreased levels of histidine. In addition, a combination of alanine, histidine, leucine, pyruvate, tyrosine, and valine in CSF showed a superior correlation with the presence of T2DM (AUC:0.951), diabetic retinopathy (AUC:0.858), nephropathy (AUC:0.811), and neuropathy (AUC:0.691). Similar correlations also appeared in plasma profiling. These metabolic alterations in CSF suggest decreasing aerobic metabolism and increasing anaerobic glycolysis in cerebral circulation of patients with T2DM. In conclusion, our results provide clues for the metabolic derangements in diabetic central neuropathy among T2DM patients; however, their clinical significance requires further exploration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607389>Modulating  Fibrillation Using Engineered -Chains with Mutated C-Termini.</a></h2><p>Stress-induced unfolding and fibrillation of  represent serious medical and biotechnological problems. Despite many attempts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of  fibrillation, there is no general agreement on how this process takes place. Several previous studies suggested the importance of the C-terminal region of -chain in this pathway. Therefore, we generated the T30R and K29R/T30R mutants of  -chain. Recombinantly produced wild-type A-chain and mutant -chains were combined efficiently in the presence of chaperone α-crystallin. The mutant -chains along with the control wild-type  were used in a wide range of parallel experiments to compare their fibrillation kinetics, morphology of fibrils, and forces driving the fibril formation. The mutant insulins and their -chains displayed significant  against stress-induced fibrillation, particularly at the nucleation stage, suggesting that the -chain might be influencing the  fibrillation. The fact that the different mature insulins formed larger fibrillar bundles compared to those formed by their -chains alone suggested the role of A-chain in the lateral association of the  fibrils. Overall, in addition to the N-terminal region of the -chain, which was shown to serve as an important regulator of  fibrillation, the C-terminal region of this peptide is also crucial for the control of fibrillation, likely serving as an attachment site engaged in the formation of the nucleus and protofibril. Finally, two mutated  variants examined in this study might be of interest to the pharmaceutical sector as, to our knowledge, novel intermediate-acting  analogs because of their suitable biological activity and improved stability against stress-induced fibrillation.Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society.

There are no reliable and inexpensive methods to evaluate obesity. All of the anthropometric measurements used have some limitations. In 2012, Krakauer et al developed a new method, called A Body Shape Index (ABSI), to identify abdominal obesity that is derived from weight, height, and waist circumference. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical usefulness of the ABSI to predict the presence of  (IR) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in renal transplant recipients. A total of 155 patients were included in the study. Prevalence of IR was 17.4%, and MetS was 62.6%. ROC results demonstrated the power of all anthropometric indices to discriminate patients with and without MetS and IR in the renal transplant populations. ROC curves showed that waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) had the optimal power to discriminate MetS and IR in women. WC had higher area under curve than all other anthropometric indices to predict MetS and IR in men. WC in men and WHtR in women has higher discriminatory capacity to predict MetS and IR in renal transplant recipients. An obvious difference was observed in the optimal anthropometric measures between the 2 sexes, suggesting that sex-specific measures should be used in practice. In order to evaluate the value of ABSI in determining metabolic risk factors, studies with larger, randomized, controlled body fat ratios are needed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We show that fat mass increases with age and represents a major contributor to  and the metabolic syndrome. We summarize the effects of age on the adipose tissue (AT), related to the abundance, distribution, cellular composition, endocrine signaling and function of the tissue. The AT is an immunological tissue, with several hallmarks of innate and adaptive immune responses. We show that in both mice and humans, the AT is heavily infiltrated by immune cells that have receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines secreted by the adipocytes and also by the immune cells that have infiltrated the AT. We also show that the AT provides an environment for the secretion of IgG antibodies with anti-self (autoimmune) reactivity. As we have previously shown, this is due to the release of self antigens following cell death due to hypoxia, as well as to the expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, the enzyme of class switch recombination, and the transcription factor T-bet by the resident  cells, which also express the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. We show data in support of the AT as a tertiary lymphoid organ (TLO), showing the examples of TLOs that develop within the AT, such as fat-associated lymphoid clusters and milky spots, as well as artery TLOs that develop in the adventitia areas of the aorta.© 2019 S.

Our present results showed that inhibition of miR-27a/ expression led to increased hepatic protein levels of G6pase and PEPCK and enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of miR-27a/ suppressed hepatic glucose production and alleviated hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. Further study revealed that FOXO1 was a downstream target of miR-27a/.

Briefly, the adipose tissue through the production of many factors, such as leptin, free fatty acids (FFA), and cytokines may affect both ovarian and endometrium functions, with a final alteration in oocyte maturation and endometrial epithelium receptivity. In addition, through the development of peripheral  obesity produces a condition of functional hyperandrogenism and hyperestrogenism that contribute to produce anovulation and to reduce endometrial receptivity and, therefore participate to cause infertility.

The objectives of the present study were to establish an economical and efficient animal model, mimicking pathophysiology of human T2DM to understand probable molecular mechanisms in context with lipid metabolism. In the present study, male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups. Animals were fed with high fat diet (HFD) except healthy control (HC) for 12 weeks. After eight weeks, intra peritoneal glucose tolerance test was performed. After confirmation of glucose intolerance, diabetic control (DC) group was injected with streptozotocin (STZ) (35 mg/kg .w., i.p.). HFD fed rats showed increase ( ≤ 0.001) in glucose tolerance and HOMA-IR as compared to HC. Diabetes rats showed abnormal ( ≤ 0.001) lipid profile as compared to HC. The hepatocyte expression of transcription factors  and  and their target genes were found to be upregulated, while  and  expressions were downregulated as compared to the HC.

The addition of PBM in neurodegenerative diseases is a dual modality that is at present gaining traction as it is safe, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory for treating neurodegeneration with photons that stimulate mitochondria increasing adenosine triphosphate and proteasomes increasing misfolded protein removal. Neurofeedback provides neural plasticity with an increase in brain-derived nerve factor mRNA and an increase in dendrite production and density in the hippocampus coupled with overall growth in dendrites, density, and neuronal survival.  Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein neurofibrillary tangles and subsequently amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. PBM and neurobiofeedback (NBF)address the multiple gene expression and upregulation of multiple pathogenic pathway inflammation, reactive oxidative stress, mitochondrial disorders, , methylation defects, regulation of neuroprotective factors, and regional hypoperfusion of the brain. There is no human evidence to suggest a clinical therapeutic benefit from using consistent light sources while significantly increasing safety concerns.  A PBM test with early- to mid-Alzheimer's was reported in 2017, consisting of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a small pilot group of early- to mid-dementia subjects under Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Clinical Trial.

Although excessive sugar consumption is now robustly associated with an array of adverse health consequences, comparatively little research has thus far addressed its impact on the risk of mental illness. But ample evidence suggests that high-dose sugar intake can perturb numerous metabolic, inflammatory, and neurobiological processes. Many such effects are of particular relevance to the onset and maintenance of depressive illness, among them: systemic inflammation, gut microbiota disruption, perturbed dopaminergic reward signaling, , oxidative stress, and the generation of toxic advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Accordingly, we hypothesize that added dietary sugars carry the potential to increase vulnerability to major depressive disorder, particularly at high levels of consumption. The present paper: (a) summarizes the existing experimental and epidemiological research regarding sugar consumption and depression vulnerability; () examines the impact of sugar ingestion on known depressogenic physiological processes; and (c) outlines the clinical and theoretical implications of the apparent sugar-depression link. We conclude that the extant literature supports the hypothesized depressogenic impact of added dietary sugars, and propose that an improved understanding of the effects of sugar on body and mind may aid in the development of novel therapeutic and preventative measures for depression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The presence of electron-donating and hydrogen bond acceptor groups at position 4' of ring  could improve α-glucosidase activity. Position 3 of ring C favored minor, electron-donating, and hydrogen bond donor groups, whereas position 7 of ring A favored bulky and hydrogen bond acceptor groups. Molecular docking screened five flavonoids (baicalein, isorhamnetin-3--rutinoside, apigenin-7--glucoside, kaempferol-7--β-glucoside, and cyanidin-3--glucoside) that can act as  sensitizers and form strong combinations with four key protein targets involved in the  signaling pathway. Apigenin-7--glucoside (60 μM) can effectively improve , and glucose uptake increased by approximately 73.06% relative to the model group of -resistant HepG2 cells. Therefore, apigenin-7--glucoside might serve as the most effective α-glucosidase inhibitor and  sensitizer.

It is worthwhile to assess these associations in a combination model rather than in an isolated form. In the current study, we aimed to use structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess the association of adherence to a healthy eating index (HEI)-2015 with socio-demographic factors, psychological characteristics, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and other cardio-metabolic risk factors among obese individuals.This cross-sectional study was conducted among 188 healthy obese adults (96 males and 92 females) aged 20-50 years in Tabriz. A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to record dietary intake and to estimate HEI-2015. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure and biochemical measurements were evaluated according to standard protocols. Interrelationships among socio-demographic parameters and HEI with cardio-metabolic risk factors were analyzed using SEM.The results of SEM analysis revealed that HEI mediated the association between age and several cardio-metabolic risk factors including fat mass (FM), fat free mass (FFM), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (p < 0.05). Moreover, adherence to Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) appears to mediate association between gender and waist circumference ( = -9.78), SBP ( = -4.83), triglyceride ( = -13.01) and HDL ( = 4.31). HEI also mediated indirect negative effects of socioeconomic status on FM ( = -0.56), FFM ( = -0.25), SBP ( = -0.55) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ( = -0.3). Additionally, depression and age had indirect unfavorable effects on some  indices such as homeostasis model assessment of  ( = 0.07; p<0.05, for age) and quantitative  sensitivity check index (p<0.05, for age and depression) via HEI. High adherence to HEI was found to be inversely associated with MetS risk (p<0.05).Adherence to HEI-2015 seems to mediate the effect of socio-demographic parameters and mental health on cardio-metabolic risk factors as well as MetS risk.

This degenerative loss of muscle mass is associated with poor quality of life and early mortality humans. The loss of muscle mass occurs due to acute changes in daily muscle net protein balance (NPB). It is generally believed a poor NPB occurs due to reduced muscle protein synthetic responses to exercise, dietary amino acid availability, or an insensitivity of  to suppress breakdown. Hence, aging muscles appear to be resistant to the anabolic action of exercise and protein (amino acids or hormonal) when compared to their younger counterparts. The mechanisms that underpin anabolic  to anabolic stimuli (protein and  exercise) are multifactorial and may be partly driven by poor lifestyle choices (increased sedentary time and reduced dietary protein intake) as well as an inherent dysregulated mechanism in old muscles irrespective of the environmental stimuli. The  like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), Akt /Protein Kinase  and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is the primary driver between mechanical contraction and protein synthesis and may be a site of dysregulation between old and younger people. Therefore, our review aims to describe and summarize the differences seen in older muscle in this pathway in response to  exercise (RE) and describe approaches that researchers have sought out to maximize the response in muscle. Furthermore, this review will present the hypothesis that inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) may be implicated in IGF-1 signaling and thus sarcopenia, based on recent evidence that IGF-1 and  share some intracellular bound signaling events and that IP6K1 has been implicated in skeletal muscle .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322509>CORRELATION BETWEEN LEVELS OF HOMOCYSTEINE, ANTI-MÜLLERIAN HORMONE AND  IN PCOS PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT MISCARRIAGE.</a></h2><p>There are controversial opinions regarding the impact of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and  in PCOS patients who experience Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL).

Objective - investigate the relationship between level of homocysteine, anti-müllerian hormone and  in PCOS patients with Recurrent Pregnancy Loss. 80 Georgian young women (<30 years) with PCOS were involved in the prospective study. The diagnosis of PCOS was based on the criteria of Rotterdam Consensus 2003. Patients were divided into two groups: group I-50 patients, who experienced RPL, and group II-30 patients with live births in anamnesis (control group). Patients with RPL were divided into two subgroups: subgroup A-with  (n=28), and subgroup -without  (n=22). All patients underwent hormonal investigation from day 2 to 3 of menstrual cycle. Plasma levels of anti-müllerian hormone, homocysteine, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), total testosterone (T), free testosterone (FT), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were determined. Between 2-3 days of the menstrual cycle all participants underwent an ultrasound examination using Voluson E10. This was done to determine ovarian volume and antral follicle count. Average homocysteine (Hcy) level in PCOS patients with RPL (11.5±2.24μmol/l) was significantly higher than in controls (7.55±2.45 μmol/l, p<0.001). Incidence of (HHcy) and IR in patients with RPL was 70% and 56% respectively, which was significantly higher than in controls (HHcy-54.3%; IR- 9.4%; p<0.0001). HOMA-IR in patients with RPL was significantly higher compared with controls (p<0.001). Average AMH level in patients with RPL and live births did not differ significantly. In the group of PCOS with RPL significant positive correlation between Hcy and HOMA-IR, BMI, AMH and FT levels was found (p<0.001). Serum homocysteine level is elevated in PCOS patients with RPL. This elevation is correlated with the degree of obesity, BMI,  status, AMH and androgen levels.

Over the last decade, evidence has accumulated that demonstrates the anti-cancer effects of an anti-diabetic drug - metformin - in endocrine malignancies. We performed a literature review utilizing the Pubmed, Medline and clinicaltrials.gov databases using the keyword "metformin" plus the following terms: "thyroid cancer," "thyroid nodules," "parathyroid," "hyperparathyroidism," "adrenal adenoma," "Cushing syndrome," "hyperaldosteronism," "adrenocortical cancer," "neuroendocrine tumor (NET)," "pancreatic NET (pNET)," "carcinoid," "pituitary adenoma," "pituitary neuroendocrine tumor (PitNET)", "prolactinoma," "pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma." We found 37 studies describing the preclinical and clinical role of metformin in endocrine tumors. The available epidemiological data shows an association between exposure of metformin and lower incidence of thyroid cancer and pNETs in diabetic patients. Metformin treatment has been associated with better response to cancer therapy in thyroid cancer and pNETs. Preclinical evidence suggests that the primary direct mechanisms of metformin action include inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation via inhibition of both mitochondrial complex I and mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, leading to metabolic stress. Decreased ATP production leads to an activation of a cellular energy sensor, AMPK, and subsequent downregulation of mTOR signaling pathway, which is associated with decreased cellular proliferation.

Certain lifestyle factors, physical inactivity and typical Western diet (TWD) containing high fat and high sugar are strongly associated with  and T2D. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is a major mediator of effects of  and plays a crucial role in T2D pathogenesis. Decreased levels of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) subunits as well as blunted Akt kinase phosphorylation have been observed in the AD brain, characterized by amyloid-β and tau pathologies. Furthermore, AD mouse models fed with TWD have shown to display altered levels of PI3K subunits. How impaired -PI3K-Akt signaling in peripheral tissues or in the central nervous system (CNS) affects the development or progression of AD is currently poorly understood.

Abnormalities related to these lipids lead to metabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Despite extensive research, it is still unclear why a subset of obese subjects develop metabolic syndrome, while others do not. The aim of our work was to assess total and plasma membrane expressions of cholesterol transport proteins: adipocyte ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), adipocyte ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1), class  scavenger receptor (SR-BI) in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese subjects with and without metabolic syndrome. To keep our preliminary study group uniform, we focused on women, who constitute the majority of bariatric patients. The study was performed on 34 patients: 24 morbidly obese women subjected to bariatric surgery, half of whom had metabolic syndrome; and 10 lean subjects undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Total and plasma membrane expressions of cholesterol transport proteins (SR-BI, ABCA1 and ABCG1) were assessed in samples of both visceral and subcutaneous adipose and analysed in relation to other clinical and laboratory parameters. We demonstrated lower plasma membrane expressions of ABCG1 in visceral adipose tissue of obese patients with metabolic syndrome as compared to lean ones. In addition, total ABCG1 expressions in both types of adipose tissue were lower in morbidly obese patients with metabolic syndrome compared to those without metabolic syndrome. Plasma membrane ABCA1 expressions in visceral adipose tissue were lower in the group of morbidly obese patients without metabolic syndrome, compared to lean patients. We did not find any significant differences in SR-BI expressions. Because of ABCG1 is responsible for cholesterol efflux to HDL, reduced plasma membrane expression of ABCG1 in VAT of morbidly obese women with metabolic syndrome may leads to a significantly decreased concentration of HDL in serum. This may be also confirmed by high positive correlation between both parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321377>Diabetes, , Fetuin- and Exercise Training.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384536>Regulation of microbiota-GLP1 axis by sennoside A in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Sennoside A (SA) is a bioactive component of Chinese herbal medicines with an activity of irritant laxative, which is often used in the treatment of constipation and obesity. However, its activity remains unknown in the regulation of  sensitivity. In this study, the impact of SA on  sensitivity was tested in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice through dietary supplementation. At a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day, SA improved  sensitivity in the mice after 8-week treatment as indicated by HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for ) and glucose tolerance test (GTT). SA restored plasma level of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) by 90% and mRNA expression of  by 80% in the large intestine of HFD mice. In the mechanism, SA restored the gut microbiota profile, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and mucosal structure in the colon. A mitochondrial stress was observed in the enterocytes of HFD mice with ATP elevation, structural damage, and complex dysfunction. The mitochondrial response was induced in enterocytes by the dietary fat as the same responses were induced by palmitic acid in the cell culture. The mitochondrial response was inhibited in HFD mice by SA treatment.

Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to  and type 2 diabetes. At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced mitochondria release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new  vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ improved this process by downregulating ROS and provided a degree of protection. Our study provides a new perspective for MEHP on the cytotoxic mechanism and PQQ protection in INS-1 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31345420>Neonates from women with pregestational maternal obesity show reduced umbilical vein endothelial response to .</a></h2><p>Pregestational maternal obesity (PGMO) associates with foetoplacental vascular endothelial dysfunction and higher risk for  in the neonate.

AF was evaluated and induced by burst atrial pacing. Isolated atrial myocytes were used for whole-cell patch clamp and calcium assessment. Ex vivo whole heart was used for optical mapping. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used for quantitative protein evaluation.Both HFa and HFr rat atria were vulnerable to AF evaluated by burst atrial pacing. Isolated atrial myocytes from HFa and HFr rats revealed significantly increased sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium content and diastolic calcium sparks. Whole-heart mapping showed prolonged calcium transient duration, conduction velocity reduction, and repetitive ectopic focal discharge in HFa and HFr atria. Protein analysis revealed increased TGF-β1 and collagen expression; increased superoxide production; abnormal upregulation of calcium-homeostasis-related proteins, including oxidized CaMKIIδ, phosphorylated-phospholamban, phosphorylated-RyR-2, and sodium-calcium exchanger; and increased Rac1 activity in both HFa and HFr atria. We observed that inhibition of CaMKII suppressed AF in both HF and HFr diet-fed rats. In vitro palmitate-induced IR neonatal cardiomyocytes and atrial fibroblasts expressed significantly more TGF-β1 than did controls, suggesting paracrine and autocrine effects on both myocytes and fibroblasts.IR engenders both atrial structural remodeling and abnormal intracellular calcium homeostasis, contributing to increased AF susceptibility.

However, SGA treatment is associated with severe metabolic alterations and body weight gain, which can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that metabolic changes in -sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the metabolic disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole-body glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG, lipid dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on  signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and  secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31192707>New insights into the function of melatonin and its role in metabolic disturbances.</a></h2><p>Melatonin is a pineal hormone that has acquired several unique modes of regulating the physiological effects in mammals due to its characteristic phylogenetic history. While melatonin exhibits immediate nocturnal effects, it also has next-day prospective effects that take place in the absence of this hormone.

To elucidate the underlying mechanism by which DEHP or MEHP perturbs hepatic glucose homeostasis, we compared the effect of DEHP (0-200 μM) and MEHP (0-200 μM) on glucose metabolism in HepG2 cells. In this study, we found that MEHP can induce more severe impairments in glucose homeostasis than DEHP can; these include increased hepatic gluconeogenesis via receptor substrate-1/protein kinase /fork-head box protein O1 (IRS-1/AKT/FOXO1)-mediated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) up-regulation, as well as decreased hepatic glycogen synthesis via glucokinase (GCK) inhibition and IRS-1/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)-mediated glycogen synthase (GYS) inactivation. Additionally, our results demonstrated that retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), an -inducing factor, plays a critical role in the MEHP-induced disorder of glucose homeostasis and the dysfunction of  signaling transduction, whereas the deletion of RBP4 by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) significantly reversed these toxic effects. Although these should be interpreted with caution in view of limited in vivo evidence, the present study provides the first in vitro evidence for potential involvements of RBP4 in disturbance of glucose homeostasis in the MEHP-treated HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Our previous study reveals that interleukin-4 (IL-4) inhibits adipogenesis and promotes lipolysis to decrease lipid deposits by enhancing the activity of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). The present study further dissects and characterizes the molecular mechanism of IL-4 in regulating HSL expression and lipolytic activity in the terminal differentiated 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes. Our results showed that IL-4 increased cAMP which then enhanced PKA activity and subsequent phosphorylation of HSL and perilipin. The phosphorylated HSL (p-HSL) translocated from cytoplasm to the surface of lipid droplets and exhibited lipolytic function. After being phosphorylated, p-perilipin also facilitated lipolysis through interacting with p-HSL. The in vitro findings were further verified by in vivo study in which IL-4 exhibited pro-lipolytic activity and enhanced HSL activity. In summary, the net outcome of IL-4 treatment is to reduce lipid storage by promoting lipolysis through enhancing HSL activity via cAMP/PKA pathway, the major route leading to lipolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178136>Targeting Trim69 alleviates high fat diet (HFD)-induced hippocampal injury in mice by inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation through ASK1 inactivation.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of obesity is growing, and high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity can alter the brain and cognition. However, the link between HFD, hippocampal function, and inflammation is still not fully understood. Tripartite motif (TRIM) family has been implicated in various cellular processes, such as apoptosis, neurogenesis, and innate immune responses. Trim69, a member of TRIM family, was investigated in the present study to determine its role in HFD-induced hippocampal damage. Here, we first found that hippocampal Trim69 expression was markedly down-regulated in wild-type (WT) mice challenged with HFD. Trim69 knockout (KO) mice exhibited an exaggerated version of the metabolic disorder after HFD challenge, as evidenced by their increased body weight and elevated . HFD-induced hippocampal injury was further aggravated by Trim69 deletion, as confirmed by the reduced survival of neurons and increased level of apoptotic cell death. In addition, the inflammatory response triggered by HFD was more pronounced in the hippocampi of Trim69-KO mice after blockage of the activation of the nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 4 (MKK4), MKK7, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the hippocampi of HFD-challenged mice was intensified by the loss of Trim69. Hippocampal-apoptosis-signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) phosphorylation was also found to be up-regulated by HFD, especially in mice with Trim69 deletion. Of note, we found that Trim69 directly interacted with and deubiquitinated ASK1 in microglial cells. Microglial cell-specific suppression of Trim69 exacerbated inflammation and apoptosis in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Trim69 over-expression markedly alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory response and apoptotic cell death in microglial cells. Together, these results indicated that Trim69 might be a functionally essential inhibitor of ASK1 activation during the pathogenesis of hippocampal inflammation and apoptosis, and it could serve as a novel molecular target for obesity-associated brain damage.Copyright © 2019.

NAFLD is defined by hepatic steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning and stage of fibrosis, but it is unclear if and which components could contribute to IR.To assess which histological components of NAFLD associate with IR in subjects with obesity, and if so, to what extent.This cross-sectional study included 78 obese subjects (mean age 46±11 years; BMI 42.2±4.7 kg/m²). Glucose levels were analysed by hexokinase method and  levels with electrochemiluminescence. Homeostasis model assessment-estimated  (HOMA-IR) was calculated. Liver biopsies were evaluated for histological components of NAFLD.A positive association between overall NAFLD activity score and HOMA-IR was found (rs=0.259, p=0.022). As per individual components, lobular inflammation and fibrosis stage were positively associated with HOMA-IR, glucose and  levels (p<0.05), and HOMA-IR was higher in patients with more inflammatory foci or higher stage of fibrosis. These findings were independent of age, BMI, triglyceride levels, diabetes status and sex (all, p<0.043).

According to reactivity hypothesis, sympathetic response to stressors may be more sensitive at predicting IR than baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), a baseline measure of baroreflex functioning. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of negative affect coupled with minute-to-minute HR and heart-rate variability (HRV) monitoring, we examined whether negative affect (NA)-related autonomic arousal mediates the association of BRS with IR. At baseline, BRS was measured, and fasting serum glucose and  levels were collected from 178 young adults (18-39 years old), from which homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell functioning (HOMA %) were derived. Participants subsequently underwent one day of Holter HR and HRV monitoring while reporting negative affect levels  EMA. Multilevel modeling was used to assess the associations of momentary negative affect with HR and low- (LF) and high-frequency (HF) HRV during the 5-minute intervals following each EMA reading. Structural equation modeling was then used to determine whether individual differences in these associations mediated the association of BRS with IR, measured by HOMA-IR, HOMA %, and  levels. As predicted, BRS was negatively associated with the IR ( = -.17,  = .024). However, NA-related autonomic arousal mediated their association, accounting for 56% of the covariance between BRS and IR.

All HCV patients with EMs should be considered for antiviral therapy, although not all will resolve with sustained virological response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396860>Knock-in of Mutated hTAU Causes , Inflammation and Proteostasis Disturbance in a Mouse Model of Frontotemporal Dementia.</a></h2><p>Diabetes and obesity have been implicated as risk factors for dementia. However, metabolic mechanisms and associated signalling pathways have not been investigated in detail in frontotemporal dementia. We therefore here characterised physiological, behavioural and molecular phenotypes of 3- and 8-month-old male tau knock-in (PLB2) vs wild-type (PLB) mice. Homecage analysis suggested intact habituation but a dramatic reduction in exploratory activity in PLB2 mice. Deficits in motor strength were also observed. At 3 months, PLB2 mice displayed normal glucose handling but developed hyperglycaemia at 8 months, suggesting a progressive diabetic phenotype. Brain, liver and muscle tissue analyses confirmed tissue-specific deregulation of metabolic and homeostatic pathways. In brain, increased levels of phosphorylated tau and inflammation were detected alongside reduced ER regulatory markers, overall suggesting a downregulation in essential cellular defence pathways. We suggest that subtle neuronal expression of mutated human tau is sufficient to disturb systems metabolism and protein handling. Whether respective dysfunctions in tauopathy patients are also a consequence of tau pathology remains to be confirmed, but could offer new avenues for therapeutic interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31349033>The effects of  and -like growth factor I on amyloid precursor protein phosphorylation in in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing problem worldwide, and there are currently no effective treatments for this devastating disease. The neurotrophic growth factors  and -like growth factor-I (IGF-I) are currently being investigated as potential therapeutic approaches for AD in preclinical and clinical studies. However, given that the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and diabetes are risk factors for AD, it is unknown how associated  (IR) in the brain may impact the effectiveness of these therapies for AD. In this report, we therefore investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of  and IGF-I on AD-associated pathology in the context of IR, with particular emphasis on phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key step in promoting amyloid plaque formation in AD. Both  and IGF-I decreased APP phosphorylation in cultured primary cortical neurons, supporting their therapeutic use in AD. Induction of IR blocked the beneficial effect of  and reduced the effect of IGF-I on APP dephosphorylation. These effects were mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/protein kinase  (Akt) pathway, as inhibition of this pathway during IR restored the effect of IGF-I on APP dephosphorylation. Finally, we explored the translational relevance of these results in vivo by demonstrating that high fat diet fed mice, a robust model of IR and MetS, exhibited the expected increased brain APP phosphorylation. Overall, these data suggest that the beneficial therapeutic effect of  and IGF-I on APP phosphorylation is negatively impacted by IR, and suggest that  and IGF-I alone may not be appropriate therapies for AD patients with IR, MetS, or diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Over the last decade, growing evidence has identified the gut microbiota as a potential factor in the pathophysiology of both obesity and the related metabolic disorders. The gut microbiota is known to protect gastrointestinal mucosa permeability and to regulate the fermentation and absorption of dietary polysaccharides, perhaps explaining its importance in the regulation of fat accumulation and the resultant obesity. The proposed mechanisms by which the gut microbiota could contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and the related metabolic diseases include: (a) a high abundance of bacteria that ferment carbohydrates, leading to increased rates of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) biosynthesis, providing an extra source of energy for the host, that is eventually stored as lipids or glucose; () increased intestinal permeability to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), resulting in elevated systemic LPS levels that aggravate low-grade inflammation and ; (c) increased activity of the gut endocannabinoid system. Fecal transplantation studies in germ-free mice have provided crucial insights into the potential causative role of the gut microbiota in the development of obesity and obesity-related disorders. Diet +/- bariatric surgery have been reported to modulate the gut microbiota, leading to lean host phenotype body composition. This review aims to report clinical evidence for a link of the gut microbiota with human obesity and obesity-related diseases, to provide molecular insights into these associations, and to address the effect of diet and bariatric surgery on the gut microbiota, including colonic microbiota, as a potential mechanism for promoting weight loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506152>[Correlation between serum microRNA-122 and  in obese children].</a></h2><p>To study the relationship between serum microRNA-122 (miR-122) and  in obese children.Forty-seven children with severely obesity aged 7-14 years and 45 age- and gender matched healthy children with normal weight (control group) were enrolled.

This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary inulin supplementation on growth performance and meat quality in growing-finishing pigs. Thirty-six Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire White growing barrows (22.0 ± 1.0 kg) were randomly allocated to two dietary treatments consisting of a basal control diet (CON) or basal diet supplemented with 0.5% inulin (INU). Results showed that inulin supplementation tended to increase the average daily gain (ADG) at the fattening stage (0.05 <  < 0.10). Inulin significantly increased the dressing percentage ( < 0.05) and tended to increase the loin-eye area. The serum concentrations of  and IGF-I were significantly higher ( < 0.05) in the INU group than in the CON group. Moreover, inulin supplementation significantly elevated the expression level of myosin heavy chain II  () in the longissimus dorsi ( < 0.05). Inulin significantly upregulated the expression of mammalian rapamycin target protein () but decreased ( < 0.05) the expression level of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase .

Coffee by-products extracts (31-500 μg mL) and pure phenolics (100 μmol L) reduced lipid accumulation and increased mitochondrial activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Also reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 and diminished secretion of pro-inflammatory factors in LPS-stimulated RAW2643.7 macrophages. Cytokine release diminished (tumor necrosis factor α: 23-57%; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1: 42-60%; interleukin-6: 30-39%) and adiponectin increased (7-13- fold) in adipocytes treated with macrophage-conditioned media. ROS scavenging and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α pathway counteracted mitochondrial dysfunction. Increases in  receptor (1.4 to 4-fold), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (2 to 3-fold) and protein kinase  (1.3 to 3-fold) phosphorylation, in conjunction with a decrease in serine phosphorylation of  receptor substrate 1, evoked glucose transporter 4 translocation (8-15-fold) and glucose uptake (44-85%).

Recent work has exhibited that FAM134B plays a pivotal role in autophagy-mediated turnover of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, tumor inhibition and lipid homeostasis. In this study, we provide mechanistic links between FAM134B and adipocyte differentiation. Here, we found that adipocyte-specific FAM134B overexpression mice are obese and have increased white adipose tissue (WAT) mass. Serum tests showed that they developed high glucose level and severe . In addition, they also exhibited enhanced autophagy and reduced mitochondria amount, suggesting the function of FAM134B to promote autophagy in adipocytes. Overexpression of FAM134B in 3 T3-L1 preadipocytes promoted autophagy and differentiation, while the effect could be inhibited after treatment with autophagyinhibitors, 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Overexpressioncells also showed an early reduction of mitochondria number, while its autophagy flux level increased fast from differentiation day 2.

A pooled analysis which assessed these parameters has not been performed. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to sum up existing evidence about the issue.We searched in MEDLINE and PUBMED for studies that were published before November 2018. Meta-analysis of diabetics and nondiabetics trials were performed by use of a random-effects model.A total of 13 case-control studies that included 428 subjects with body mass index ≥25 were identified. RS supplementation reduced fasting  in overall and stratified (diabetics and nondiabetics trials) analysis (SMD = -0.72; 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.31; SMD = -1.26; 95% CI: -1.66 to -0.86 and SMD = -0.64; 95% CI: -1.10 to -0.18, respectively), and reduced fasting glucose in overall and stratified analysis for diabetic trials (SMD = -0.26; 95% CI: -0.5 to -0.02 and SMD = -0.28; 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.01, respectively).

In this study, we sought to determine the relationship of physical fitness with two developmental phenomena of adolescence,  and depression/anxiety symptoms among at-risk youth. We conducted secondary data analyses of 241 overweight or obese adolescents (12-17 years), drawn from two study cohorts.  sensitivity index was derived from oral glucose tolerance tests. Adolescents self-reported depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms on validated surveys. A walk/run test was administered to determine perceived exertion and physical fitness (distance traveled).  sensitivity was positively associated with walk/run distance (  =0.16,  0.01), even after accounting for all covariates. Anxiety symptoms were inversely related to perceived exertion (  =-0.11,  0.05), adjusting for covariates.

We examined the effects of an HMB-enriched diet in healthy rats and rats with liver cirrhosis induced by multiple doses of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). HMB increased branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; valine, leucine and isoleucine) in blood and BCAA and ATP in muscles of healthy animals. The effect on muscle mass and protein content was insignificant. In CCl4-treated animals alterations characteristic of liver cirrhosis were found with decreased ratio of the BCAA to aromatic amino acids in blood and lower muscle mass and ATP content when compared with controls. In CCl4-treated animals consuming HMB, we observed higher mortality, lower body weight, higher BCAA levels in blood plasma, higher ATP content in muscles, and lower ATP content and higher cathepsin  and L activities in the liver when compared with CCl4-treated animals without HMB. We conclude that (1) HMB supplementation has a positive effect on muscle mitochondrial function and enhances BCAA concentrations in healthy animals and (2) the effects of HMB on the course of liver cirrhosis in CCl4-treated rats are detrimental. Further studies examining the effects of HMB in other models of hepatic injury are needed to determine pros and cons of HMB in the treatment of subjects with liver cirrhosis.© 2019 The Authors.

The phenomenon of chronic low-grade inflammation could be attributed to non-classical forms of inflammation, which include many neurodegenerative processes, pathological variants of , atherosclerosis, and other manifestations of the endothelial dysfunction. Individual and universal manifestations of cellular stress could be considered as a basic element of all these pathologies, which has both physiological and pathophysiological significance. The review examines the causes, main phenomena, developmental directions and outcomes of cellular stress using a phylogenetically conservative set of genes and their activation pathways, as well as tissue stress and its role in inflammatory and para-inflammatory processes. The main ways towards the realization of cellular stress and its functional blocks were outlined. The main stages of tissue stress and the classification of its typical manifestations, as well as its participation in the development of the classical and non-classical variants of the inflammatory process, were also described. The mechanisms of cellular and tissue stress are structured into the complex systems, which include networks that enable the exchange of information with multidirectional signaling pathways which together make these systems internally contradictory, and the result of their effects is often unpredictable. However, the possible solutions require new theoretical and methodological approaches, one of which includes the transition to integral criteria, which plausibly reflect the holistic image of these processes.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31173239>MicroRNA‑802 increases hepatic oxidative stress and induces  in high‑fat fed mice.</a></h2><p>The expression of microRNA‑802 (miR‑802) is known to be associated with  (IR); however, the mechanism remains unclear. The present study investigated how miR‑802 contributes to the development of IR using C57BL/6J mice fed a high‑fat diet (HFD) to establish a model of IR. Adeno‑associated virus overexpressing miR‑802 was administered to the mice via tail vein injection. The effects of miR‑802 on reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the activities of multiple ROS‑related enzymes were investigated. Western blot analysis was used to estimate the protein levels of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), p38mitogen‑activated protein kinases (p38MAPK), c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK),  receptor substrate 1 (IRS‑1) and protein kinase  (AKT1). The results demonstrated that the levels of ROS and LPO production were increased in the livers of the miR‑802‑treated group compared with the control group. The activities of the ROS‑related enzymes were reduced. Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylated (phosphor)‑p38MAPK and phosphor‑JNK were upregulated in the miR‑802 overexpression group, whereas there was no difference in the expression levels of phosphor‑ERK. The expression levels of phosphor‑AKT1 were reduced in the miR‑802‑treated group and these effects were reversed by miR‑802 knockdown. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that miR‑802 may cause IR by activating the JNK and p38MAPK pathways to increase hepatic oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409776>Gut-associated IgA immune cells regulate obesity-related .</a></h2><p>The intestinal immune system is emerging as an important contributor to obesity-related , but the role of intestinal  cells in this context is unclear. Here, we show that high fat diet (HFD) feeding alters intestinal IgA immune cells and that IgA is a critical immune regulator of glucose homeostasis. Obese mice have fewer IgA immune cells and less secretory IgA and IgA-promoting immune mediators. HFD-fed IgA-deficient mice have dysfunctional glucose metabolism, a phenotype that can be recapitulated by adoptive transfer of intestinal-associated pan- cells. Mechanistically, IgA is a crucial link that controls intestinal and adipose tissue inflammation, intestinal permeability, microbial encroachment and the composition of the intestinal microbiome during HFD. Current glucose-lowering therapies, including metformin, affect intestinal-related IgA  cell populations in mice, while bariatric surgery regimen alters the level of fecal secretory IgA in humans.

Different parameters were then assessed using flow cytometry, confocal as well as SE microscopy, and RT-qPCR.Our results clearly demonstrated that calystegines could improve EqASC viability and proliferation and significantly reduce apoptosis, via improvement of mitochondrial potentiation and functionality, regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways, and suppression of ER stress. Furthermore, nortropanes positively upregulated GLUT4 and IRS transcripts, indicating a possible sensitizing or mimetic effect to .

The PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases were searched, using the terms "advanced glycation end products," "overweight," and "obesity." The last search was performed in October 2018.Six studies that evaluated the effects of low-AGE and high-AGE diets were included in the review. The duration of the studies ranged from 1 day to 12 weeks. A comparison of all the compiled data was conducted by the authors.Circulating and urinary AGE markers, besides soluble receptor for AGEs, were considered as the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were cardiometabolic, inflammatory, glycemic, anthropometric, and renal markers.AGE-RAGE interactions can activate the NF-κ (nuclear factor kappa ) signaling pathway and inhibit the PI3K-AKT pathway in adipocytes, which may explain their association with chronic diseases. This interaction can be considered as a novel explanation for the pathogenesis of obesity. AGEs can also be used as a biomarker for monitoring responses to dietary interventions in overweight and obese people.PROSPERO registration no. CRD42018082745.© The Author(s) 2019.

Based on data obtained at the whole cell level using poorly specific chemical probes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) like superoxide and hydrogen peroxide have been proposed to contribute to the stimulation of  secretion by nutrients (positive role) and to the alterations of cell survival and secretory function in T2D (negative role). This raised the controversial hypothesis that any attempt to decrease β-cell oxidative stress and apoptosis in T2D would further impair  secretion. Over the last decade, the development of genetically-encoded redox probes that can be targeted to cellular compartments of interest and are specific of redox couples allowed the evaluation of short- and long-term effects of nutrients on β-cell redox changes at the subcellular level. The data indicated that the nutrient regulation of β-cell redox signaling and ROS toxicity is far more complex than previously thought, and that the subcellular compartmentation of these processes cannot be neglected when evaluating the mechanisms of ROS production or the efficacy of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant drugs under glucolipotoxic conditions and in T2D. In this review, we present what is currently known about the compartmentation of redox homeostatic systems and tools to investigate it.

The close relationship between genetic and environmental factors suggests that eating habits and unhealthy lifestyles may significantly affect metabolic pathways, resulting in dynamic modifications of chromatin-associated proteins and homeostatic transcriptional responses involved in the progression of T2DM. Epigenetic mechanisms may be implicated in the complex processes linking environmental factors to genetic predisposition to metabolic disturbances, leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Endothelial dysfunction represents an earlier marker and an important player in the development of this disease. Dysregulation of the endothelial ability to produce and release vasoactive mediators is recognized as the initial feature of impaired vascular activity under obesity and other  conditions and undoubtedly concurs to the accelerated progression of atherosclerotic lesions and overall cardiovascular risk in T2DM patients. This review aims to summarize the most current knowledge regarding the involvement of epigenetic changes associated with endothelial dysfunction in T2DM, in order to identify potential targets that might contribute to pursuing "precision medicine" in the context of diabetic illness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528183>Alcohol consumption and its interaction with genetic variants are strongly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes: a prospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>Both genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to the incidence of type 2 diabetes. It yet remains controversial whether and how alcohol consumption, one of the most prevalent lifestyle habits, influences type 2 diabetes. Moreover, whether alcohol consumption interacts with genetic risk is inconclusive. Thus, we aimed to explore the effects of alcohol, genetic risk and their potential interactions on type 2 diabetes risk.The Shanghai Diabetes study (SHDS) had a total of 2546 participants with 611 incident cases of combined type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose regulation (IGR). We constructed weighted genetic risk score (GRS) for type 2 diabetes and categorized the GRS into three strata. And the homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-) and  (HOMA-IR) were calculated. Then we used logistic regression models and multiple linear regression models to examine the influence of both baseline alcohol consumption and genetic risk on blood glucose deterioration,  (IR) and beta cell function (BC), respectively. Moreover, we investigated the interactions of alcohol intake with: (1) GRSs for type 2 diabetes, IR, BC, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR); and (2) each of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) used to establish the GRSs mentioned above.Alcohol consumption and higher T2D-GRS both contributed to a higher incidence rate of blood glucose deterioration [odds ratio (OR), 2.24, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.76-2.87; OR, 1.25, 95% CI, 1.11-1.42; respectively]. Alcohol reduced  sensitivity and compensated by enhancing beta cell function (β = 1.98,  < .0001 and β = - 1.97, P < .0001 for HOMA-IR and inverse HOMA-β, respectively). T2D-GRS deteriorated  secretion (β = 0.10,  = 0.0069 for inverse HOMA-) but not  sensitivity ( = 0.0856). Moreover, there was a significant interaction between alcohol and T2D-GRS (P = 0.0318), suggesting the association between alcohol and type 2 diabetes was much stronger in the lower T2D-GRS group than in the higher T2D-GRS group. And this interaction was more pronounced in men (P = 0.0176) than in women (P = 0.3285). No single SNP interacted strongly with alcohol intake.Alcohol consumption strongly increased the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing IR, especially in men with low T2D-GRS, highlighting the importance of refraining from drinking alcohol when making recommendations for healthy lifestyle habits to prevent diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517617>The effect of peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY3-36), a selective Y2 receptor agonist on streptozotocin-induced diabetes in albino rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of the PYY3-36, as a potential therapy for the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), induced by high fat diet (HFD) and an intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of streptozotocin (STZ) in albino rats.Forty adult male albino Wistar rats were divided into: 1) control group (C, in which the rats were fed with a standard diet and received vehicle; 2) diabetic group (D, in which T2DM was induced by feeding the rats with HFD for four weeks followed by a single i.p. injection of 35 mg/kg STZ, this group was also allowed to have HFD till the end of the study; and 3) D+PYY3-36 group (in which the diabetic rats were treated with 50 µg/kg i.p.

It also decreased the expression of both the hypothalamic NPY and the visceral fat NF-κ.With respect to the fact of improved  release and enhanced  sensitivity (an effect that may be mediated via suppressing accumulation of visceral fat and inflammatory markers), in the rats treated with PYY3-36, the PYY3-36 might be considered for the future as a promising therapeutic tool in T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514320>Serum Secretogranin III Concentrations Were Increased in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome and Independently Associated with Fasting Plasma Glucose Levels.</a></h2><p>Secretogranin III (SCG3) plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of secretory granules in endocrine cells, and thus affects glucose homeostasis by regulating  secretion by pancreatic beta cells.  and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are hallmarks of metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the role of SCG3 in MetS remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between serum SCG3 levels and metabolic parameters in subjects with and without MetS. This was a case control study, and 295 subjects were recruited. Serum SCG3 concentrations were compared between groups. Associations between SCG3 levels and clinico-metabolic parameters were also examined. We found serum SCG3 levels were higher in the MetS group than non-MetS group (122.6 ± 79.2 vs. 90.6 ± 58.5 nmol/L,  = 0.009). Specifically, elevated SCG3 levels were found in subjects with high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, central obesity, or hypertriglyceridemia. Additionally, MetS was an independent factor of serum SCG3 levels in multivariate linear regression analyses. Moreover, FPG, free fatty acids, and waist circumference were positively associated with serum SCG3 concentrations after adjusting for  levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and cardiovascular risk factors. In conclusion, serum SCG3 concentrations were higher in subjects with MetS and were independently associated with FPG levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500396>The Redox Role of G6PD in Cell Growth, Cell Death, and Cancer.</a></h2><p>The generation of reducing equivalent NADPH via glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is critical for the maintenance of redox homeostasis and reductive biosynthesis in cells. NADPH also plays key roles in cellular processes mediated by redox signaling. Insufficient G6PD activity predisposes cells to growth retardation and demise. Severely lacking G6PD impairs embryonic development and delays organismal growth. Altered G6PD activity is associated with pathophysiology, such as autophagy, , infection, inflammation, as well as diabetes and hypertension. Aberrant activation of G6PD leads to enhanced cell proliferation and adaptation in many types of cancers. The present review aims to update the existing knowledge concerning G6PD and emphasizes how G6PD modulates redox signaling and affects cell survival and demise, particularly in diseases such as cancer. Exploiting G6PD as a potential drug target against cancer is also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434580>The Association of Red Meat Intake with Inflammation and Circulating Intermediate Biomarkers of Type 2 Diabetes Is Mediated by Central Adiposity.</a></h2><p>We explored the role of lipid accumulation products and visceral adiposity on the association between red meat consumption and markers of  (IR) and inflammation in US adults. Data on red meat consumption, and health outcome measurements were extracted from the 2005-2010 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Overall 16,621 participants were included in the analysis (mean age = 47.1 years, 48.3% men). Analysis of co-variance and "conceptus causal mediation" models were applied, while accounting for survey design. In adjusted models, a lower red meat consumption was significantly associated with a cardio-protective profile of IR and inflammation. Body mass index (BMI) had significant mediation effects on the associations between red meat consumption and C-reactive protein (CRP), Apolipoprotein-, fasting glucose (FBG), , homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) IR and β-cell function, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), triglyceride to high density lipoprotein (TG:HDL) ratio and triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index (all p < 0.05). Both waist circumference and anthropometrically predicted visceral adipose tissue (apVAT) mediated the association between red meat consumption with CRP, FBG, HbA1c, TG: HDL ratio and TyG index (all p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that adiposity, particularly the accumulation of abdominal fat, accounts for a significant proportion of the associations between red meat consumption IR and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669171>Hormonal regulation of visfatin gene in avian Leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells.</a></h2><p>Visfain has been extensively studied in mammals and has been shown to play an important role in obesity and . However, there is a paucity of information on visfatin regulation in non-mammalian species. After characterization of chicken visfatin gene, we undertook this study to determine its hormonal regulation in avian (non-mammalian) liver cells. Addition of 5 ng/mL TNFα, 100 ng/mL leptin, 1, 3, 10 or 100 ng/mL T3 for 24 h upregulated visfatin gene expression by 1.2, 1.8, 1.95, 1.75, 1.80, and 2.45 folds (P < .05), respectively, compared to untreated LMH cells. Administration of 10 ng/mL of orexin A significantly down regulated visfatin gene expression by 1.35 folds compared to control cells. In contrast, treatment with IL-6 or orexin  for 24 h did not influence visfatin mRNA abundance. These pro-inflammatory cytokines and obesity-related hormones modulate the expression of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptors. Hepatic CRP gene expression was significantly upregulated by IL-6, TNFα, orexin , and T3 and down regulated by leptin and orexin A. LXR mRNA abundances were increased by orexin A, decreased by orexin , and T3, and did not affected by IL6, TNFα, or leptin. The expression of FXR gene was induced by IL-6, leptin, and T3, but it was not influenced by TNFα, orexin A or . CXR gene expression was up regulated by TNFα, leptin, orexin , and T3, down regulated by 5 ng/mL orexin A, and did not affected by IL-6. INSIG2 mRNA levels were increased by TNFα (5 ng/mL), leptin (100 ng/mL), and T3 (1, 3, 10, and 100 ng/mL), decreased by orexin A, and remained unchanged with IL-6 or orexin  treatment. Together, this is the first report showing hormonal regulation of visfatin in avian hepatocyte cells and suggesting a potential role of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptor LXR, FXR, and CXR in mediating these hormonal effects.Copyright © 2019.

Animal models have been very useful for the study of this disease and to search for new therapeutic targets that delay, attenuate, or avoid diabetic complications. The purpose of this work was to establish a model of type 2 diabetes and exhibit the majority of the characteristics of the disease. Two-day-old male and female Wistar rats were treated once with streptozotocin (70 or 90 mg/kg body weight). After weaning, they were given a sucrose-sweetened beverage (SSB; sucrose at 10 or 30%) during 7 or 11 weeks; their body weight and food intake were measured daily. With the rats at 14 weeks of age, we determined the following: (a) fasting blood glucose, () oral glucose tolerance, and (c)  tolerance.

It plays an important role in regulating skeletal muscle metabolism. Lack of the SCD1 gene increases the rate of fatty acid β-oxidation through activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and the upregulation of genes that are related to fatty acid oxidation. The mechanism of AMPK activation under conditions of SCD1 deficiency has been unclear. In the present study, we found that the ablation/inhibition of SCD1 led to AMPK activation in skeletal muscle through an increase in AMP levels whereas muscle-specific SCD1 overexpression decreased both AMPK phosphorylation and the adenosine monophosphate/adenosine triphosphate (AMP/ATP) ratio. Changes in AMPK phosphorylation that were caused by SCD1 down- and upregulation affected NAD levels following changes in NAD -dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) activity and histone 3 (H3K9) acetylation and methylation status. Moreover, mice with muscle-targeted overexpression of SCD1 were more susceptible to high-fat diet-induced lipid accumulation and the development of  compared with wild-type mice. These data show that SCD1 is involved in nucleotide (ATP and NAD ) metabolism and suggest that the SCD1-dependent regulation of muscle steatosis and  sensitivity are mediated by cooperation between AMPK- and SIRT1-regulated pathways. Altogether, the present study reveals a novel mechanism that links SCD1 with the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis and  sensitivity in skeletal muscle.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234308>Association of Low Serum Adiponectin Levels with Aortic Arterial Stiffness in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic protein, affects glucose metabolism. High serum adiponectin levels are associated with decreased diabetes mellitus (DM) risks. Aortic arterial stiffness (AS) is associated with cardiovascular disease and mortality in type 2 DM patients. We assessed the association between adiponectin levels and aortic AS in type 2 DM patients. We measured serum adiponectin levels in 140 volunteers with type 2 DM and assigned patients with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) >10 m/s to the aortic AS group ( = 54, 38.6%). These patients had higher systolic ( = 0.001) and diastolic ( = 0.010) blood pressures; body fat masses ( = 0.041); serum triglyceride ( = 0.026), phosphorus ( = 0.037), and  ( = 0.040) levels; and homeostasis model assessment of  values ( = 0.029) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rates ( = 0.009) and serum adiponectin levels ( = 0.001) than controls. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for confounders showed serum adiponectin levels (OR 0.922; 95% CI, 0.876-0.970;  = 0.002) as an independent predictor of aortic AS. Multivariable forward stepwise linear regression analyses showed that serum adiponectin levels (β = -0.283, adjusted R change: 0.054,  < 0.001) were negatively associated with cfPWV.

Fetuin-A is associated with , and the concentration of circulating fetuin-A increases in women with GDM, however, the role of fetuin-A in the placenta remains unclear. In this study, we enrolled placental samples from twenty pregnant women with GDM and twenty non-GDM pregnant women and found that the abundance of fetuin-A was upregulated in terms of mRNA and protein levels. Fetuin-A inhibited placental cell growth by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting S phase entry. Irregular alignment of mitotic chromosomes and aberrant mitotic spindle poles were observed. In addition, centrosome amplification was induced by fetuin-A treatment, and these amplified centrosomes nucleated microtubules with disorganized microtubule arrays in placental cells. Furthermore, fetuin-A inhibited autophagy, and thus blocked the growth of the primary cilium, a cellular antenna that regulates placenta development and differentiation. Thus, our study uncovered the novel function of fetuin-A in regulating placental cell growth and ciliogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604029>Intermittent restraint-induced sympathetic activation attenuates hepatic steatosis and inflammation in a high fat-diet fed-mouse model.</a></h2><p>NAFLD is very prevalent worldwide, and is associated with  and metabolic syndrome. Stress is physiological and biological response to maintain homeostasis of body against stressors while severe stress response is an important contributor to various illnesses including metabolic syndrome and brain disorders. We have evaluated the effects of intermittent restraint stress on NAFLD in a HFD-fed mouse model. C57/BL6 mice had free access to a 60% HFD for 8 weeks, with or without intermittent restraint stress (3 h) conducted 3 times a week. HFD administration increased fat accumulation in liver tissues. Unlike the stressed standard diet group, the levels of hepatic total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly ameliorated in the HFD with stress group compared to the HFD alone group. These beneficial results were in accordance with serum levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and hepatic levels of TNF-α and oxidative stress parameters (ROS, NO, and malondialdehyde). The intermittent restraint stress significantly attenuated the HFD-derived alterations in serum  levels, hepatic protein kinase  (AKT) activity and gene expression especially related to lipogenesis. This intermittent restraint stress also elevated the serum epinephrine concentration and activated the adrenergic receptor β2 or β 3 in livers or WAT. The activations of energy expenditure markers (UCP1, PGC1α) in brown adipose tissue and the browning of WAT were also observed in the HFD with stress group.

This study demonstrated the capacity of elderberry fruit (EDB) extract to decrease the elevated production of reactive oxygen species in hypertrophied 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatment with the EDB extract resulted in modulation of mRNA expression and protein secretion of key adipokines in hypertrophied adipocytes. Expression of leptin and adiponectin was, respectively, down- and up-regulated. Moreover, glucose uptake stimulation was noticed in mature adipocytes, both sensitive to  and  resistant. This may suggest a positive effect of EDB extract on  status. The extract was also found to alleviate the inflammatory response in activated RAW 264.7 macrophages by down-regulating the expression of proinflammatory genes (, , , ) and suppressing the enhanced production of inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, PGE, NO).  experiments showed that the EDB extract could inhibit digestive enzymes, including -amylase, -glucosidase, and pancreatic lipase, leading to reduced intestinal absorption of dietary lipids and carbohydrates.

A key diagnostic of the metabolic syndrome is  in both peripheral tissues and brain, especially in the hypothalamus. Since the anorexigenic hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) regulates food intake in part by inhibiting the excitability of the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons, we hypothesized that E2 would protect against  in NPY/AgRP neurons with diet-induced obesity (DIO). Therefore, we did whole-cell recordings and single cell qPCR in arcuate NPYGFP neurons from both female and male mice to test the efficacy of  with DIO. The resting membrane potential and input  of NPY/AgRP neurons was significantly increased in DIO versus control-diet fed males. Most notably, the efficacy of  to activate KATP channels in NPY/AgRP neurons was significantly attenuated, although the KATP channel opener diazoxide was fully effective in NPY/AgRP neurons from DIO males, indicating that the KATP channels were expressed and functional. In contrast,  was fully efficacious to activate KATP channels in DIO females, and the response was reversed by the KATP channel blocker tolbutamide. However, the ability of  to activate KATP channels was abrogated with ovariectomy but fully restored with E2 replacement. The  in obese males was likely mediated by an increase in suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), protein tyrosine phosphatase  (PTP1B) and T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) activity since the expression of all three mRNAs were upregulated in the obese males but not in females. As proof of principle, pre-incubation of hypothalamic slices from DIO males with the PTP1B/TCPTP inhibitor CX08005 completely rescued the effects of . Therefore, E2 protects NPY/AgRP neurons in females against  through, at least in part, attenuating phosphatase activity.

The relationship between periodontitis and diabetes is bidirectional. Type 2 diabetic patients are more prone to chronic periodontitis (CP) and severe periodontitis affects the glycemic control in such patients. Recently, dental diode laser has become an effective tool in controlling CP. To date, very few studies have been conducted to check the efficacy of diode laser in control of periodontal destruction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) patients. Hence, the need of the study was to evaluate whether diode laser helps improvement of periodontal outcome and reduction in anaerobic bacteria in elderly diabetic patients with CP.  Forty DM2 patients with CP were randomized into group A (control): scaling and root planing (SRP) only and group  (test): SRP followed by soft tissue dental diode laser (808 nm) application. Four patients (2 in each group) were lost during follow up. Clinical parameters, plaque samples and glycated hemoglobin levels were evaluated at both baseline and 90 days post-treatment.  Improvement in clinical, microbiological and glycemic parameters were noted in the group that received SRP as well as SRP + LANAP (laser-assisted new attachment procedure). The reductions in clinical parameters were statistically significant after 3 months (<0.001). The microbial analysis of plaque samples for  () and  () decreased significantly after 3 months in group  than in group A. Glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1c) decreased significantly after 90 days in both the groups (<0.001) with more reduction in the SRP+LANAP group (6.49%) in comparison to SRP alone (16.25% vs. 9.76%). However, on the intergroup comparison, the difference in HbA1c reduction was nonsignificant.  Laser as an adjunct to SRP is an effective procedure for improving clinical and microbiological parameters in maturity onset diabetes mellitus patients with CP. Also, there was a better improvement in glycemic control in the test group compared to control group after 3 months. Hence, medically compromised patients like DM2 with CP with delayed wound healing can effectively be treated by laser as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal therapy for better results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31236888> in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Improved by Chinese Medicine Dingkun Pill (): A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>To assess the efficacy and safety of the Chinese medicine Dingkun Pill (, DKP) on  in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).A total of 117 women with PCOS were randomly assigned to Group A (38 women), Group  (40 women), or Group C (39 women) in a randomization sequence with SAS software and a 1:1:1 allocation ratio using random block sizes of 6, and were given 7 g of oral DKP daily (Group A), 1 tablet of Diane-35 orally daily (Group ), or 7 g of oral DKP daily plus 1 tablet of Diane-35 orally daily (Group C).

The association between waist circumference categories and the development of erosive esophagitis was also evident.In a large cohort of strictly defined metabolically healthy men and women, the MHO phenotype was associated with an increased incidence of erosive esophagitis, providing evidence that the MHO phenotype is not protective from gastroesophageal reflux disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620616>Pharmacologic therapy for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis focusing on pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>The paradigm of chronic liver diseases has been shifting. Although hepatitis  and C viral infections are still the main causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the introduction of effective antiviral drugs may control or cure them in the near future. In contrast, the burden of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing for decades, and 25 to 30% of the general population in Korea is estimated to have NAFLD. Over 10% of NAFLD patients may have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of NAFLD. NASH can progress to cirrhosis and HCC. NASH is currently the second leading cause to be placed on the liver transplantation list in the United States. NAFLD is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. The pathophysiology is complex and associated with lipotoxicity, inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, and . The only proven effective treatment is weight reduction by diet and exercise. However, this may not be effective for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, effective drugs are urgently needed for treating these conditions. Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved for the treatment of NASH. Many pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop new drugs for the treatment of NASH. Some of them are in phase 2 or 3 clinical trials. Here, pharmacologic therapies in clinical trials, as well as the basic principles of drug therapy, will be reviewed, focusing on pathophysiology.Copyright © 2019 Yeungnam University College of Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587376>Discovery of a role of the novel hepatokine, hepassocin, in obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a public health problem that has raised concerns worldwide and is often associated with hepatic steatosis. Hepassocin is a novel hepatokine that causes hepatic steatosis and induces  (IR). However, the role of hepassocin in obesity remains obscure. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between hepassocin levels and obesity. In total, 371 subjects who had a normal weight (NW), were overweight, or were obese were enrolled. We found that hepassocin levels in subjects who were overweight (6,705 ± 1,707 pg/ml) or obese (7,335 ± 2,077 pg/ml) were significantly higher than those of subjects with a NW (5,767 ± 1,500 pg/ml) (p < .001, test for trend). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the body-mass index, waist circumference, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and homeostatic model assessment of IR were independently associated with hepassocin after adjusting for age, sex, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, log triglycerides, alanine transaminase, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate. This study provides evidence that subjects who were overweight or obese had significantly higher hepassocin levels than those with a NW. Hepassocin may be a useful biomarker in managing obesity and its related metabolic dysregulation.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480627>Lyophilized Maqui () Berry Induces Browning in the Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue and Ameliorates the  in High Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Maqui () berry features a unique profile of anthocyanidins that includes high amounts of delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside-5-O-glucoside and delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside and has shown positive effects on fasting glucose and  levels in humans and murine models of type 2 diabetes and obesity. The molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of maqui on the onset and development of the obese phenotype and  was investigated in high fat diet-induced obese mice supplemented with a lyophilized maqui berry. Maqui-dietary supplemented animals showed better  response and decreased weight gain but also a differential expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, multilocular lipid droplet formation and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). These changes correlated with an increased expression of the carbohydrate response element binding protein  (), the sterol regulatory binding protein 1c () and Cellular repressor of adenovirus early region 1A-stimulated genes 1 () and an improvement in the fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) signaling. Our evidence suggests that maqui dietary supplementation activates the induction of fuel storage and thermogenesis characteristic of a brown-like phenotype in scWAT and counteracts the unhealthy metabolic impact of an HFD. This induction constitutes a putative strategy to prevent/treat diet-induced obesity and its associated comorbidities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233715>Glutamine confers renoprotection by normalizing lipid and glutathione content in -resistant pregnant rats.</a></h2><p>Increasing consumption of fructose is a major contributor to epidemic metabolic syndrome (MS), and the risk of renal disorders and/or injuries remains high among individuals with MS particularly during pregnancy. Glutamine (GLT) has been demonstrated to have a modulatory effect in MS and/or  (IR). This study investigated the effect of GLT on renal lipid accumulation and glutathione depletion induced by high fructose-enriched drink (FED) in pregnant rats and also tested the hypothesis that the renoprotective role of GLT is by suppression of adenosine deaminase (ADA)/xanthine oxidase (XO)/uric acid (UA) pathway.Pregnant Wistar rats weighing between 160 and 180 g were allotted into Control, GLT, FED and FED + GLT groups (6 rats/group). The groups received distilled water (vehicle, p. o.), 1 g/kg bw GLT (p.o.), 10% Fructose (w/v) and 10% Fructose (w/v) plus 1 g/kg bw GLT (p.o.) respectively, daily for 19 days.Data showed that FED caused IR, increased body weight gain, blood glucose, plasma , creatinine, urea, lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, lactate production, aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase, depressed Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, sodium-potassium-ATPase activities and glutathione. These alterations were accompanied by increased activity of ADA/XO/UA pathway. However, the FED-induced renal injury and its correlates were normalized by GLT supplementation.The present results demonstrate that renal lipid accumulation and glutathione depletion-driven renal injury in pregnant rats is accompanied by increased activity of ADA/XO/UA pathway. The findings also suggest that GLT would confer protection against renal injury by protecting against lipid accumulation and glutathionedepletion, at least in part, through suppression of ADA/XO/UA pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Rats with a normal birth weight (NBW) or IUGR were fed basic diets (NBW and IUGR groups) or basic diets supplemented with curcumin (NBW-C and IUGR-C groups) from 6 to 12 weeks. Rats in the IUGR group showed higher levels of glucose and homeostasis model assessment for  index (HOMA-IR) (P < 0·05) than in the NBW group. The livers of IUGR rats exhibited higher (P < 0·05) concentration of TAG and lower (P < 0·05) activities of lipolysis enzymes compared with the normal rats. In response to dietary curcumin supplementation, concentrations of serum , glucose and HOMA-IR, pyruvate, TAG, total cholesterol and NEFA in the liver were decreased (P < 0·05). The concentrations of glycogen and activities of lipolysis enzymes in the liver were increased (P < 0·05) in the IUGR-C group compared with the IUGR group. These results were associated with lower (P < 0·05) phosphorylated  receptor substrate 1, protein kinase  or Akt, glycogen synthase kinase 3β and expressions of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and fatty acid synthase (FASN); decreased expressions for Cd36, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (Srebf1) and Fasn; increased (P < 0·05) expression of PPARα; and expressions for Ppara and hormone-sensitive lipase in the liver of IUGR-C rats than the IUGR rats.

Here, we report that Bacteroides vulgatus was markedly elevated in the gut microbiota of individuals with PCOS, accompanied by reduced glycodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid levels. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from women with PCOS or . vulgatus-colonized recipient mice resulted in increased disruption of ovarian functions, , altered bile acid metabolism, reduced interleukin-22 secretion and infertility. Mechanistically, glycodeoxycholic acid induced intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cell IL-22 secretion through GATA binding protein 3, and IL-22 in turn improved the PCOS phenotype. This finding is consistent with the reduced levels of IL-22 in individuals with PCOS.

Here, we aimed to investigate whether different doses of atorvastatin (ATV) affect rats with T2DM. A total of 110 Sprague-Dawley rats were successfully established as T2DM models.  First, the total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high-/low-/very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c/LDL-c/VLDL-c), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), apolipoprotein Al (ApoA1) and apolipoprotein  (ApoB) levels in rat serum were analyzed. In addition, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) were also measured. Then, the incidence of adverse reactions was noted. Finally, the pathological study of liver and pancreatic tissues was performed.  Rats administered ATV at the doses of 40 and 80 mg/(kg·day) showed down-regulated TG, LDL-c, ApoB, CETP and RBP4 levels yet up-regulated HDL-c and ApoAl levels. Rats administered ATV at a dose of 80 mg/(kg·day) exhibited a higher incidence of adverse reactions and higher ALT and AST levels but lower BUN and Cr levels, which might affect liver and kidney function. Rats administered ATV at the doses of 40 and 80 mg/(kg·day) demonstrated significantly improved liver injury and pancreatic injury induced by T2DM.  These data revealed that ATV could improve the lipid metabolism in T2DM rats and 40 mg/(kg·day) may serve as the optimal dose for the reduction of lipid levels and the incidence of adverse effects.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589549>Relationship Between Metabolic Syndrome and Beta-Cell Function in Nondiabetic Korean Premenopausal and Postmenopausal Women: 2015 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.</a></h2><p> This study was conducted to assess the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and beta-cell function in nondiabetic Korean women.

The effects of DZ-50 and the antiandrogen, enzalutamide (as single agents or in combination) on cell death, EMT-MET interconversion, and expression of IGFBP3 and the androgen receptor (AR), were examined. The TRAMP mouse model of prostate cancer progression was used as a pre-clinical model. Transgenic mice (20-wks of age) were treated with DZ-50 (100 mg/kg for 2 wks, oral gavage daily) and prostate tumors were subjected to immunohistochemical assessment of apoptosis, cell proliferation, markers of EMT and differentiation and IGFBP-3 and AR expression. A tissue microarray (TMA) was analyzed for expression of IGBP-3, the target of DZ-50 and its association with tumor progression and biochemical recurrence.We found that treatment with DZ-50 enhanced the anti-tumor response to the antiandrogen via promoting EMT to MET interconversion, . This DZ-50-mediated phenotypic reversal to MET leads to prostate tumor re-differentiation , by targeting nuclear IGFBP-3 expression (without affecting AR).

However, emerging data suggest that the development of diabetes in islet autoantibody-positive individuals may also involve factors such as obesity and genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes, and the influence of these factors increases with age at diagnosis. Although these factors have been linked with metabolic outcomes, particularly through their impact on β-cell function and  sensitivity, growing evidence suggests that they might also interact with the immune system to amplify the autoimmune response. The presence of factors shared by both forms of diabetes contributes to disease heterogeneity and thus has important implications. Characteristics that are typically considered to be nonimmune should be incorporated into predictive algorithms that seek to identify at-risk individuals and into the designs of trials for disease prevention. The heterogeneity of diabetes also poses a challenge in diagnostic classification. Finally, after clinically diagnosing type 1 diabetes, addressing nonimmune elements may help to prevent further deterioration of β-cell function and thus improve clinical outcomes. This Perspectives in Care article highlights the role of type 2 diabetes-associated genetic factors (e.g., gene variants at transcription factor 7-like 2 []) and obesity (via , inflammation, β-cell stress, or all three) in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and their impacts on age at diagnosis.
