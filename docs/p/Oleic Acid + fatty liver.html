The effect of cooking oils depends on their   composition. Therefore, it is important to blend different types of oils to improve functional properties. In this study we evaluated the effects of a functional blended oil (BO) composed of a high level of  (OA) (50.93%) and α-linolenic  (ALA) (5.41%) on cardiovascular health, blood pressure (BP) and body weight (BW) in comparison with lard oil (LO) and peanut oil (PO). Ninety male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and fed for 12 weeks with BO, LO and PO. Each group was divided into low, middle and high fat groups and fed with oil supply ratios of 6.7%, 10.9% and 48.1%, respectively. After the feeding period, the rats were sacrificed, and data were collected and analyzed. Rats treated with BO especially at a high dose (HBO) showed a significantly lower body weight, fat weight,  weight, fat ratio, food intake and energy intake. BO significantly reduced n-6/n-3 levels in plasma,  and adipose tissues as well as serum triglycerides (TGs) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but contrarily increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, HBO treatments decreased mRNA expression of lipid anabolism-related genes, lipid inflammatory-related genes, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and increased lipid catabolism-related genes as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma mRNA (PPARγ mRNA). In terms of antioxidant enzymes, BO treatment has increased the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by lowering malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tissues. Moreover, BO supplementation showed a significant lowering effect on the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), blood pressure (BP), atherosclerosis index (AI) and heart rate (HR). These findings highlight that the new blend of canola oil, corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil and sunflower oil with a low n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of 6 : 1 could prevent and control cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813326>The Antagonist Effect of Arachidonic  on  Gene Expression by Nuclear Receptor Type II Regulation.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a complex disease that has a strong association with diet and lifestyle. Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and   (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of  X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and arachidonic  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29797206>Trivalent Chromium Supplementation Ameliorates -Induced Hepatic Steatosis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Trivalent chromium [Cr(III)] is recognized as an essential trace element for human health, whereas its effect on hepatic lipid metabolism has not yet been fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects and potential mechanisms of Cr(III) on hepatic steatosis in an  (OA) induced mice model. Mice were fed with high OA for 12 weeks to induce lipid accumulation, and co-administrated with Cr(III) supplementation. Indexes of  lipid accumulation, associated lipid genes expression,  acids (FAs) profile and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed. The data showed that Cr(III) supplementation could attenuate disease progress of hepatic steatosis and protect  from high OA. After Cr(III) supplementation, elevated body weight and  injury in steatosis mice were reversed, excessive lipid accumulation and FAs were also reduced. The up-regulation of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) following steatosis induction were inhibited by Cr(III). Cr(III) reduced the content of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α, IL-12) and restored the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) to the control values. Our results suggest that Cr(III) supplementation is a novel strategy for alleviating OA-induced hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30835849>Extraction Technology Can Impose Influences on Peanut Oil Functional Quality: A Study to Investigate the Lipid Metabolism by Sprague-Dawley Rat Model.</a></h2><p>In this study, peanut oil was prepared by cold pressing (temperature under 60 °C), hot pressing (temperature above 105 °C), and enzyme-assisted aqueous extraction technology. Influences of an extraction technology on the oil   composition and the content of minor bioactive compounds, including tocopherols, polyphenols, and squalene, were investigated in detail. High-fat-diet Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model was then established to probe the impact of cold-pressed peanut oil (CPO), hot-pressed peanut oil (HPO), and enzyme-assisted aqueous-extracted peanut oil (EAO) on lipid metabolism outcomes, to explore influences of different extraction technologies on lipid functional quality. Results showed that  was the predominate   in the EAO (52.57 ± 0.11%), which was also significantly higher (P < 0.05) than CPO and HPO. The HPO showed higher total tocopherol and polyphenol contents (206.84 ± 6.93 mg/kg and 47.87 ± 6.50 mg GA/kg, respectively) than CPO and EAO (P < 0.05). However, the squalene content in CPO was 475.47 ± 12.75 mg/kg, which was the highest among the three oils (P < 0.05). The animal experiment results revealed that EAO could be more prone to induce lipid accumulation in the , which may likely to cause nonalcoholic  disease. However, the serum lipid profiles indicated that the CPO was more beneficial than the EAO and HPO in lowering the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase contents, and increasing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol content. All of our efforts indicated that an extraction technology can affect the peanut oil lipid   composition, the bioactive compounds content, and, correspondingly, the lipid metabolism in SD rats.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30201523>Development of an in vitro model to study hepatitis C virus effects on hepatocellular lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Hepatic steatosis is common in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Particularly in patients infected with non-genotype 3 HCV, hepatic steatosis is closely related to factors of the metabolic syndrome such as hyperlipidemia. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this "metabolic" steatosis in non-3 genotype HCV infections are not well understood. Here, we aimed to develop an in vitro model to study the effect of genotype 1 HCV infection on hepatic lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism. Cellular lipid accumulation was induced in Huh-7 hepatoma cells transfected with HCV genotype 1b replicon (HCV) by incubation with increasing doses of palmitic  (C16:0) or  (C18:1 n-9) complexed to albumin mimicking hyperlipidemic conditions. Mock transfected hepatoma cells (HCV) were used as controls. Incubation with  concentrations as high as 0.5 mM did not induce toxic effects in HCV or HCV cells. In contrast, incubation with palmitic  caused dose-dependently cytotoxic effects which were more pronounced in HCV compared to HCV cells. Further analysis with subtoxic palmitic and  concentrations revealed a higher uptake of  acids and intracellular triglyceride accumulation in HCV compared to HCV cells. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) expression, indicative of mitochondrial beta-oxidation, was markedly stimulated by lipid exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. Furthermore, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) expression levels increased in FA stimulated cells, and this increase was significantly higher in HCV compared to HCV cells. In contrast, expression of the key enzymes of hepatic de novo lipogenesis   synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) was significantly reduced upon oleate exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. In summary, our newly developed cell culture model revealed effects of HCV genotype 1b infection on metabolic susceptibility to lipid accumulation and toxicity particularly to saturated lipids. These results may indicate that HCV (genotype 1b) infected individuals with hyperlipidemia may benefit from dietary or pharmacological intervention.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

The saturated   palmitate and the unsaturated   oleate are the main free  acids in adipose tissue and human diet. We asked how these  acids affect cell survival, NAMPT and NAD levels in HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes.HepG2 cells were stimulated with palmitate (0.5mM), oleate (1mM) or a combination of both (0.5mM/1mM) as well as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (0.5 mM) or the specific NAMPT inhibitor FK866 (10nM). Cell survival was measured by WST-1 assay and Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. NAD levels were determined by NAD/NADH Assay or HPLC. Protein and mRNA levels were analysed by Western blot analyses and qPCR, respectively. NAMPT enzyme activity was measured using radiolabelled C-nicotinamide. Lipids were stained by Oil red O staining.Palmitate significantly reduced cell survival and induced apoptosis at physiological doses. NAMPT activity and NAD levels significantly declined after 48h of palmitate. In addition, NAMPT mRNA expression was enhanced which was associated with increased NAMPT release into the supernatant, while intracellular NAMPT protein levels remained stable. Oleate alone did not influence cell viability and NAMPT activity but ameliorated the negative impact of palmitate on cell survival, NAMPT activity and NAD levels, as well as the increased NAMPT mRNA expression and secretion. NMN was able to normalize intracellular NAD levels but did not ameliorate cell viability after co-stimulation with palmitate. FK866, a specific NAMPT inhibitor did not influence lipid accumulation after oleate-treatment.Palmitate targets NAMPT activity with a consequent cellular depletion of NAD. Oleate protects from palmitate-induced apoptosis and variation of NAMPT and NAD levels. Palmitate-induced cell stress leads to an increase of NAMPT mRNA and accumulation in the supernatant. However, the proapoptotic action of palmitate seems not to be mediated by decreased NAD levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30368556>Differential capability of metabolic substrates to promote hepatocellular lipid accumulation.</a></h2><p>Excessive storage of triacylglycerides (TAGs) in lipid droplets within hepatocytes is a hallmark of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), one of the most widespread metabolic disorders in Western societies. For the purpose of exploring molecular pathways in NAFLD development and testing potential drug candidates, well-characterised experimental models of ectopic TAG storage in hepatocytes are needed.Using an optimised Oil Red O assay, immunoblotting and real-time qRT-PCR, we compared the capability of dietary monosaccharides and  acids to promote lipid accumulation in HepG2 human hepatoma cells.Both high glucose and high fructose resulted in intracellular lipid accumulation after 48 h, and this was further augmented (up to twofold, as compared to basal levels) by co-treatment with the lipogenesis-stimulating hormone insulin and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), respectively. The  acids palmitic and  were even more effective than these carbohydrates, inducing significantly elevated TAG storage already after 24 h of treatment. Highest (about threefold) increases in lipid accumulation were observed upon treatment with , alone as well as in combinations with palmitic  or with high glucose and insulin. Increases in protein levels of a major lipid droplet coat protein, perilipin-2 (PLIN2), mirrored intracellular lipid accumulation following different treatment regimens.Several treatment regimens of excessive fat and sugar supply promoted lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, albeit with differences in the extent and rapidity of steatogenesis. PLIN2 is a candidate molecular marker of sustained lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30054773>Fresh and stored copra meal in meat quail diets.</a></h2><p>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the addition of fresh and stored copra meal to the diet of meat quails. Two hundred eighty-seven-day-old male and female quails were distributed in a completely randomized design, with five treatments, in a 2 × 2 + 1factorial arrangement. Two copra meal types (fresh and stored) at inclusion levels of 12.5% and 25%, respectively, were added to a corn-soybean meal-based diet, with seven replicates, of eight quails each. Copra meal acidity index recorded  percentage increase from 0.47 to 3.03% after six storage months. However, regardless of storage type, its addition to quails' diet resulted in higher values of metabolizable energy, in lower feed intake and better feed conversion than corn-soybean meal diet. Copra meal addition to quails' diet did not affect carcass traits,  and pancreas relative weight, and bone growth and quality. Although copra meal storage for 180 days resulted in higher free   content in the provided feed, it can be used fresh or after storage, in diet of meat quails from 7 to 42 days of age up to 25%.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30235452>Fisetin Protects Against Hepatic Steatosis Through Regulation of the Sirt1/AMPK and   β-Oxidation Signaling Pathway in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Fisetin is a naturally abundant flavonoid isolated from various fruits and vegetables that was recently identified to have potential biological functions in improving allergic airway inflammation, as well as anti-oxidative and anti-tumor properties. Fisetin has also been demonstrated to have anti-obesity properties in mice. However, the effect of fisetin on nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is still elusive. Thus, the present study evaluated whether fisetin improves hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice and regulates lipid metabolism of FL83B hepatocytes in vitro.NAFLD was induced by HFD in male C57BL/6 mice. The mice were then injected intraperitoneally with fisetin for 10 weeks. In another experiment, FL83B cells were challenged with  to induce lipid accumulation and treated with various concentrations of fisetin.NAFLD mice treated with fisetin had decreased body weight and epididymal adipose tissue weight compared to NAFLD mice. Fisetin treatment also reduced  lipid droplet and hepatocyte steatosis, alleviated serum free  , and leptin concentrations, significantly decreased   synthase, and significantly increased phosphorylation of AMPKα and the production of sirt-1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I in the  tissue. In vitro, fisetin decreased lipid accumulation and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes.This study suggests that fisetin is a potential novel treatment for alleviating hepatic lipid metabolism and improving NAFLD in mice via activation of the sirt1/AMPK and β-oxidation pathway.© 2018 The Author(s).

However, the biological effects of its consumption are poorly described. Here we have explored the effects of its overconsumption on lipid metabolism in a non-human primate model, the common marmoset. Dietary supplementation of marmoset with hyperlipidic diet containing hybrid palm oil for 3 months did not modify plasma lipids levels, but increased glucose levels as compared to the supplementation with African palm oil.  volume was unexpectedly found to be more increased in marmosets consuming hybrid palm oil than in those consuming African palm oil. Hepatic total lipid content and circulating transaminases were dramatically increased in animals consuming hybrid palm oil, as well as an increased degree of fibrosis. Analysis of  miRNAs showed a selective modulation of certain miRNAs by hybrid palm oil, some of which were predicted to target genes involved in cell adhesion molecules and peroxisomal pathways. Our data suggest that consumption of hybrid palm oil should be monitored carefully, as its overconsumption compared to that of African palm oil could involve important alterations to hepatic metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31264285>Effect of  on induction of steatosis and cytotoxicity in BRL 3A cells.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown that monounsaturated  induces steatosis in cultured hepatocyte steatosis in the form of nonalcoholic  disease models in vitro.

Antisteatotic effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeONPs) have recently been shown in animal models of  disease. However, it is unclear whether the activity of CeONPs is related solely to the decrease in oxidative stress or, in addition, they directly decrease    accumulation. To address this question, in this work, we used an in vitro model of hepatocellular steatosis, exposing HepG2 cells to  and palmitic . Cell uptake of CeONPs and their effect on oxidative stress and viability of hepatic cells cultured with HO were also evaluated. Results show that CeONPs were uptaken by HepG2 cells and reduced oxidative stress and improved cell viability. Treatment with  and palmitic  increased lipogenesis and the content of different  acids. CeONPs reduced palmitic and stearic  and most  acids consisting of more than 18 carbon atoms. These effects were associated with significant changes in elongase and desaturase activity. In conclusion, CeONPs directly protected HepG2 cells from cell injury in oxidative stress conditions and reduced   content in steatotic conditions by inducing specific changes in   metabolism, thus showing potential in the treatment of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29603076>Effects of Rhizoma Alismatis extract on biochemical indices and adipose gene expression in -induced hepatocyte injury in Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var.

In the present study, we aimed to develop an in vitro model of hepatocyte injury using  as hepatotoxicant and evaluate the protective effects of Rhizoma Alismatis extract (RAE) in Jian carp using this model. Primary hepatocytes from Jian carp were isolated and purified and cultured in vitro. The result indicated that 0.4 mmol L  and 48 h could be the optimal conditions to induce hepatocyte injury model in cultured hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were exposed to , followed by the addition of RAE at 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, or 50 μg mL. The hepatocytes and supernatant were then analyzed. RAE suppressed -induced elevations in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, triglycerides, total cholesterol, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, cholinesterase, malondialdehyde, γ-glutamyl transferase, cytochrome P450 1A, cytochrome P450 2E1, -type   binding protein, free  ,   synthetase, and tumor necrosis factor-α (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05); reduced protein levels of cytochrome P450 1A, nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65, and NF-κB c-Rel; and inhibited cytochrome P4503A, NF-κB c-Rel, nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, and cytochrome P4501A mRNA levels.

The FFAs concentration achieving maximum fat accumulation and minimal cytotoxicity (500 μM) was standardized. HepG2 cells were exposed to the standardized FFAs concentration with and without picroside II pretreatment.Picroside II pretreatment inhibited FFAs-induced lipid accumulation by attenuating the expression of   transport protein 5, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and stearoyl CoA desaturase. Preatreatment with picroside II was also found to decrease the expression of forkhead box protein O1 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.These findings suggest that picroside II effectively attenuated   accumulation by decreasing FFAs uptake and lipogenesis.

During the development of obesity and NAFLD, mitochondria adapt to the increased lipid load in hepatocytes by increasing the rate of   oxidation. In concert with this, reactive species (RS) generation is increased, damaging hepatocytes and inducing inflammation. Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of NAFLD via undefined mechanisms. There are no FDA approved treatments for NAFLD other than weight loss and management of glucose tolerance. Electrophilic nitro- (NO-OA) displays anti-inflammatory and antioxidant signaling actions, thus mitochondrial dysfunction, RS production and inflammatory responses to NO-OA and the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone were evaluated in a murine model of insulin resistance and NAFLD. Mice on HFD for 20 wk displayed increased adiposity, insulin resistance and hepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) compared to mice on normal chow (NC). The HFD mice had mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by lower hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity compared to mice on NC. Treatment with NO-OA or rosiglitazone for the last 42 days (out of 20 wk) abrogated HFD-mediated decreases in hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity. Notably, NO-OA treatment normalized hepatic triglyceride levels and significantly reversed hepatic steatosis. Despite the improved glucose tolerance observed upon rosiglitazone treatment,  weight and hepatic triglycerides were significantly increased over vehicle-treated HFD mice. These observations support that the pleiotropic signaling actions of electrophilic  acids limit the complex hepatic and systemic pathogenic responses instigated by obesity, without the adverse effects of thiazolidinedione drugs such as rosiglitazone.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Thus, the present study investigated whether licochalcone A ameliorated weight loss and lipid metabolism in the  of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFD to induce obesity and NAFLD, and then were injected intraperitoneally with licochalcone A. In another experiment, a  cell model was established by incubating HepG2 hepatocytes with  and treating the cells with licochalcone A to evaluate lipid metabolism. Our results demonstrated that HFD-induced obese mice treated with licochalcone A had decreased body weight as well as inguinal and epididymal adipose tissue weights compared with HFD-treated mice. Licochalcone A also ameliorated hepatocyte steatosis and decreased  tissue weight and lipid droplet accumulation in  tissue. We also found that licochalcone A significantly regulated serum triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and free  acids, and decreased the fasting blood glucose value. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro, licochalcone A significantly decreased expression of the transcription factor of lipogenesis and   synthase. Licochalcone A activated the sirt-1/AMPK pathway to reduce   chain synthesis and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes.

Although ER stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, it is indispensable for cellular activity. Therefore, when assessing the pathological significance of ER stress, it is important to monitor and quantify ER stress levels. Here, we have established a novel system to monitor ER stress levels quickly and sensitively, and using this method, we have clarified the effect of differences in glucose concentration and various  acids on the ER of pancreatic β cells. First, we developed a cell system that secretes Gaussia luciferase in culture medium depending on the activation of the GRP78 promoter. This system could sensitively monitor ER stress levels that could not be detected with real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting. This system revealed that hyperglycemia does not induce unfolded protein response (UPR) in a short period of time in MIN6 cells, a mouse pancreatic β cell line. Physiological concentrations of palmitic , a saturated  , induced ER stress quickly, while physiological concentrations of , an unsaturated  , did not. Docosahexaenoic , an n-3 unsaturated  , inhibited palmitic -induced ER stress. In this study, we have established a system that can sensitively detect ER stress levels of living cells in a short period of time.

In the strive for the best kinetic parameters of biological organisms without a possibility of modifying physicochemical and biochemical reactions in the mitochondrial matrix, the mitochondria can be provided with a substrate that increases energy production efficiency and the amount of ATP. Physicochemical parameters of  MFA has become the standard of an oxidation substrate for in vivo energy production; this MFA was synthesized in organisms for millions of years. Environmental influences are the second factor which determines kinetic perfection of biological organisms during phylogenesis. Are these influences always beneficial? Mostly, they are not. However, they largely stimulate adaptive functions of the organism, including the biological function of locomotion, cognitive function and the function of positioning in the environment. Biological, energy and kinetic perfection formed in vivo can be easily destroyed if phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens abuses the diet of carnivorous animals (meat) which was not consumed by him and his ancestors during phylogenesis. This abuse is the major cause of metabolic pandemias in human population. They are: insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, obesity and nonalcoholic  disease. The most effective measures preventing metabolic pandemias, cardiac heart disease and myocardial infarction are extremely simple.

The concurrence of experimental factors as fat content and source or total caloric intake leads to prominent differences in the development of the hepatic steatosis and related disturbances. In this work, we characterized the hepatic lipid accumulation induced by HFD in wild-type (WT) and ob/ ob mice with the purpose of differentiating adaptations to HFD from those specific of increased overfeeding due to leptin deficiency-associated hyperphagia. Given that most published works have been done in male models, we used female mice with the aim of increasing the body of evidence regarding NAFLD in female subjects. HFD promoted  lipid accumulation only in the hyperphagic strain. Nevertheless, a decrease of lipid droplet-associated cholesteryl ester (CE) in both WT and obese animals was observed. These changes were accompanied by an improvement in the profile of lipoproteins that transport cholesterol and  function markers in plasma from ob/ ob mice and a lower hepatic index. Using primary hepatocytes from female mice, overaccumulation of CE induced by 0.4 mM  reversed in the presence of a specific Takeda G protein-coupled bile  receptor agonist. Nevertheless, hepatocytes from male mice were not responsive. This study suggests that enterohepatic circulation of bile acids might be one of the factors that can affect sex dimorphism in NAFLD development, which underlines the importance of including female models in the NAFLD research field. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This work provides new insight into the use of high-fat diet as a model to induce nonalcoholic  disease in wild-type and ob/ ob female mice. We show that high-fat diet induces steatosis only in ob/ ob mice while, surprisingly, several health indicators improve. Noteworthy, experiments with primary hepatocytes from male and female mice show that they express Takeda G protein-coupled bile  receptor and that it and bile  enterohepatic circulation might be accountable for sex dimorphism in nonalcoholic  disease development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30631760>Changes of the   Profile in Erythrocyte Membranes of Patients following 6-Month Dietary Intervention Aimed at the Regression of Nonalcoholic  Disease (NAFLD).</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is closely related to the metabolism disorders of  acids. The pathogenesis of the disease includes an increased concentration of FFA in blood, an increase in the biosynthesis of  acids, and disorders in the process of -oxidation.The aim of the study was to analyze the  acids in erythrocyte membranes among 55 patients with NAFLD who were subjected to a 6-month dietary intervention in order to reduce .Basic anthropometric and biochemical measurements were performed. The profile of  acids was measured in the membranes of erythrocytes and analyzed by gas chromatography. The dietary compliance was evaluated using 72-diary questionnaires, anthropometric measurements.With the reduction of  (p<0.01), the patients' biochemical and anthropometric parameters were significantly improved. A significant decrease in the concentration of alanine aminotransferase (p<0.01) and asparagine aminotransferase (p<0.01) was observed, along with a decrease in the amount of insulin (p<0.05) and insulin resistance (p<0.05). Significant changes in terms of the   profile were observed among patients who followed the dietary intervention. There was a noticeable tendency in terms of the reduction palmitic  (p<0.055) and a significant reduction of stearic  (p<0.05). Significant changes in the profile of  acids were also associated with the reductionof palmitoleic (p<0.05) and  acids (p<0.05). Another statistically significant change observed was the increase in polyunsaturated  acids. In particular (p<0.01) the rise of eicosapentaenoic (p<0.055) and docosahexaenoic acids (p<0.55) was noted.The profile of  acids turned out to be a potential biomarker of the  changes during NAFLD regression. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the usefulness and applicability of our findings in the management of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868595>Resource partitioning between two young-of-year cownose rays Rhinoptera bonasus and R. brasiliensis within a communal nursery inferred by trophic biomarkers.</a></h2><p>Although interspecific trophic interactions plays a principal role within elasmobranch communal nurseries, little is known over variation in foraging strategies adopted by young-of-year of sympatric species. To test the hypothesis of dietary resource partitioning between batoids within a communal nursery, we investigated two cownose ray species, Rhinoptera bonasus and R. brasiliensis, which occur in heterospecific groups, a strategy predicted to increase survival and foraging success. Using two biochemical tracers,  acids (FA) and stable isotopes (δ N and δ C), the combined effects of maternal investment and the formation of heterospecific groups implying competition for, or partitioning of available food resources were investigated. Through univariate and multivariate analyses of biochemical tracers in several tissues (fin clip, muscle, , red blood cells; RBC) and plasma, our results revealed significant interspecific differences in tracers between the two species. Total FAs (∑saturated FA, ∑monounsaturated FA and ∑polyunsaturated FA) and trophic biomarkers (i.e., docosahexaenoic , arachidonic ,  and δ N) were the principle tracers responsible for the differences detected. These data revealed that R. brasiliensis was less enriched in physiologically important essential FAs than R. bonasus. Our findings suggest that these congeneric species differ in maternal investment strategy and moderately partition food resources over relatively fine spatial scales within a single nursery habitat to limit competition. These results provide further knowledge on the foraging strategies adopted by batoids in communal nursery areas, information that is required for improving spatial conservation and management planning.© 2019 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160717>SIRT3 promotes lipophagy and chaperon-mediated autophagy to protect hepatocytes against lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Lipophagy is a lysosomal lipolytic pathway that complements the actions of cytosolic neutral lipases. Chaperon-mediated autophagy (CMA) triggers lipid droplets (LDs) breakdown, to initiate lipolysis via either cytosolic lipases or macroautophagy. SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase, regulates the acetylation status and activity of many substrates involving in energy metabolism. However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating lipophagy is controversial. The current study showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and the macroautophagy flux was blocked in the primary hepatocytes from high-fat diet fed mice and P/O (palmitic  and  mixture) treated AML12 mouse hepatocytes, compared with the corresponding controls. SIRT3 overexpression promoted macroautophagy in LDs from P/O-treated hepatocytes through activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51-like kinase 1, to boost LDs digestion. Gain of SIRT3 expression stimulated the formation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A)-heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70)-perilipin-2 (PLN2) complex, to promote CMA process and reduce the stability of LDs in hepatocytes. Moreover, SIRT3 reduced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, to suppress lipogenesis. In addition, SIRT3 overexpression promoted LDs dispersion on detyrosinated microtubules, and directly deacetylated long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to enhance mitochondrial energetics. Taken together, SIRT3 ameliorates lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, which might be a potential target for the treatment of nonalcoholic  disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29996339>[Effect of lipid-induced macrophage M1/M2 polarization on lipid metabolism in hepatocytes].</a></h2><p> This study aims to explore the effect of lipid-induced macrophage M1/M2 polarization on lipid metabolism in hepatocytes.  RAW264.7 macrophages were incubated with different kinds of  acids including saturated  acids-palmitic  (PA), monounsaturated  acids- (OA) and polyunsaturated  acids-docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and cell culture supernatants were collected to prepare conditioned medium (CM). Hepatocytes were isolated by in situ perfusion of the  with collagenase in mice, and a macrophage-hepatocyte CM co-culture system was established. Macrophage M1/M2 phenotype markers were detected by Real-time PCR. Lipid synthesis and decomposition related mRNA and protein expressions in hepatocytes were detected by Real-time PCR and Western Blot. Lipid depositions in hepatocytes were detected by oil red O staining. An analysis of variance was used for comparison of means between multiple groups.  Compared with control groups, PA polarized macrophages to a M1 phenotype (expression of TNF-α and IL-6 significantly increased, F≥22.68, P < 0.01), OA polarized macrophages to a M1/M2 mixed phenotype (expression of IL-6, Mrc2 and IL-10 increased F≥4.94, P < 0.05) and DHA polarized macrophages to a M2 phenotype (expression of Mrc2 and IL-10 significantly increased, F≥4.94, P < 0.01). CM-PA significantly increased lipid synthesis related genes, including SREBP1C, ACC1 mRNA expression (F≥5.66, P < 0.01) and FASN, ACC1 protein expression (F≥38.34, P < 0.05) in hepatocytes, and decreased lipid decomposition gene ACOX1 protein expression (F=154.48, P < 0.01). CM-OA affected several lipid metabolism genes expression. CM-DHA significantly increased CPT1A mRNA expression (F = 10.30, P < 0.01) and ACOX1, CPT1A protein expression (F≥47.06, P < 0.05), and decreased SREBP1C, ACC1 protein expression (F≥65.84, P < 0.05) in hepatocytes. Massive lipid droplets were deposited in hepatocytes in CM-PA treated hepatocytes, and a few amount of lipid droplets were deposited in CM-DHA treated hepatocytes.  Different  acids affect the balance of lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and  by inducing macrophage M1 / M2 polarization, thus promoting or delaying the progression of non-alcoholic  disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413241>Elaeagnus mollis Oil Attenuates Non-alcoholic  Disease in High-fat Diet Induced Obese Mice via Modifying the Expression of Lipid Metabolismrelated Genes.</a></h2><p>Elaeagnus mollis oil (EMO), which is a type of plant oil, was extracted from the nuts of Elaeagnus mollis Diels that is known as a precious woodyoilcrop in China. The present study investigated the ameliorative effects of EMO on high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and explored relative regulation mechanism. The analysis of EMO  acids showed that EMO rich in unsaturated  acids (92.07%), such as linoleic  (48.24%),  (34.20%) and linolenic  (7.57%). In addition, supplementation of EMO could ameliorate the increase in body weight, fat weight, and abnormal serum lipids induced by high-fat diet. A further important implication is that the levels of serum ALT, serum AST, hepatic TG, TC, SOD, GSH/GSSG ration and MDA were improved after supplementing with EMO. All these changes may be due to the ability of EMO to inhibit   synthesis via reducing the mRNA expression of SREBP-1c, PPARγ and FAS, and elevate   oxidation by increasing the mRNA expression of PPARα and CPT-1. Meanwhile, our results also showed that endogenously synthesized n-3 PUFAs could significantly increase after treating with EMO. In conclusion, the results suggested that EMO could be regarded as a healthy food for preventing NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28975360>Beyond detoxification: a role for mouse mEH in the hepatic metabolism of endogenous lipids.</a></h2><p>Microsomal and soluble epoxide hydrolase (mEH and sEH) fulfill apparently distinct roles: Whereas mEH detoxifies xenobiotics, sEH hydrolyzes   (FA) signaling molecules and is thus implicated in a variety of physiological functions. These epoxy FAs comprise epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and epoxy-octadecenoic acids (EpOMEs), which are formed by CYP epoxygenases from arachidonic  (AA) and linoleic , respectively, and then are hydrolyzed to their respective diols, the so-called DHETs and DiHOMEs. Although EETs and EpOMEs are also substrates for mEH, its role in lipid signaling is considered minor due to lower abundance and activity relative to sEH. Surprisingly, we found that in plasma from mEH KO mice, hydrolysis rates for 8,9-EET and 9,10-EpOME were reduced by 50% compared to WT plasma. This strongly suggests that mEH contributes substantially to the turnover of these FA epoxides-despite kinetic parameters being in favor of sEH. Given the crucial role of  in controlling plasma diol levels, we next studied the capacity of sEH and mEH KO  microsomes to synthesize DHETs with varying concentrations of AA (1-30 μM) and NADPH. mEH-generated DHET levels were similar to the ones generated by sEH, when AA concentrations were low (1 μM) or epoxygenase activity was curbed by modulating NADPH. With increasing AA concentrations sEH became more dominant and with 30 μM AA produced twice the level of DHETs compared to mEH. Immunohistochemistry of C57BL/6  slices further revealed that mEH expression was more widespread than sEH expression. mEH immunoreactivity was detected in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and bile duct epithelial cells, while sEH immunoreactivity was confined to hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells. Finally, transcriptome analysis of WT, mEH KO, and sEH KO  was carried out to discern transcriptional changes associated with the loss of EH genes along the CYP-epoxygenase-EH axis. We found several prominent dysregulations occurring in a parallel manner in both KO livers: (a) gene expression of Ephx1 (encoding for mEH protein) was increased 1.35-fold in sEH KO, while expression of Ephx2 (encoding for sEH protein) was increased 1.4-fold in mEH KO ; (b) Cyp2c genes, encoding for the predominant epoxygenases in mouse , were mostly dysregulated in the same manner in both sEH and mEH KO mice, showing that loss of either EH has a similar impact. Taken together, mEH appears to play a leading role in the hydrolysis of 8,9-EET and 9,10-EpOME and also contributes to the hydrolysis of other FA epoxides. It probably profits from its high affinity for FA epoxides under non-saturating conditions and its close physical proximity to CYP epoxygenases, and compensates its lower abundance by a more widespread expression, being the only EH present in several sEH-lacking cell types.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373507>Alcohol-induced microtubule acetylation leads to the accumulation of large, immobile lipid droplets.</a></h2><p>Although steatosis () is a clinically well-described early stage of alcoholic  disease, surprisingly little is known about how it promotes hepatotoxicity. We have shown that ethanol consumption leads to microtubule hyperacetylation that can explain ethanol-induced defects in protein trafficking. Because almost all steps of the lipid droplet life cycle are microtubule dependent and because microtubule acetylation promotes adipogenesis, we examined droplet dynamics in ethanol-treated cells. In WIF-B cells treated with ethanol and/or  (a   associated with the "Western" diet), we found that ethanol dramatically increased lipid droplet numbers and led to the formation of large, peripherally located droplets. Enhanced droplet formation required alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated ethanol metabolism, and peripheral droplet distributions required intact microtubules. We also determined that ethanol-induced microtubule acetylation led to impaired droplet degradation. Live-cell imaging revealed that droplet motility was microtubule dependent and that droplets were virtually stationary in ethanol-treated cells. To determine more directly whether microtubule hyperacetylation could explain impaired droplet motility, we overexpressed the tubulin-specific acetyltransferase αTAT1 to promote microtubule acetylation in the absence of alcohol. Droplet motility was impaired in αTAT1-expressing cells but to a lesser extent than in ethanol-treated cells. However, in both cases, the large immotile droplets (but not small motile ones) colocalized with dynein and dynactin (but not kinesin), implying that altered droplet-motor microtubule interactions may explain altered dynamics. These studies further suggest that modulating cellular acetylation is a potential strategy for treating alcoholic  disease. Chronic alcohol consumption with the "Western diet" enhances the development of  and leads to impaired droplet motility, which may have serious deletrious effects on hepatocyte function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29367738>Differential effects of reticulophagy and mitophagy on nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Autophagy affects the pathological progression of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD); however, the precise role of autophagy in NAFLD remains unclear. In this study, we want to identify the role of autophagy including reticulophagy and mitophagy in NAFLD pathogenesis. When HepG2 cells were treated with 400 μM  (OA), increased reticulophagy was induced 8 h after treatment, which correlated with an anti-apoptotic response as shown by the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, an increase in BCL-2 expression, and the downregulation of OA-induced lipotoxicity. When treated with OA for 24 h, DRAM expression-dependent mitophagy resulted in increased apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Inhibition of reticulophagy aggravated and increased lipotoxicity-induced apoptosis 8 h after treatment; however, the inhibition of mitophagy decreased hepatocyte apoptosis after 24 h of OA treatment. Results from the analysis of patient  samples showed that autophagic flux increased in patients with mild or severe NAFL. PI3K/AKT phosphorylation was observed only in samples from patients with low-grade steatosis, whereas DRAM expression was increased in samples from patients with high-grade steatosis. Together, our results demonstrate that reticulophagy and mitophagy are independent, sequential events that influence NAFLD progression, which opens new avenues for investigating new therapeutics in NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29113798>Fucoxanthin attenuates  -induced lipid accumulation in FL83B hepatocytes through regulated Sirt1/AMPK signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>The fucoxanthin, isolated from brown algae, was reported to have multiple biological functions to anti-inflammation, anti-tumor, and ameliorated obesity in mice. In this study we investigated whether fucoxanthin could inhibit lipids accumulation in FL83B hepatocytes. FL83B cells were induced as  cell model by 0.5 mM  for 48 h, and treated with various concentration of fucoxanthin for 24 h. The results demonstrated that fucoxanthin significantly suppressed lipid accumulation and decreased lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes. Fucoxanthin could decrease lipogenesis-related transcription factor expression, including sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1c and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. It also reduced   synthase expression and increased adipose triglyceride lipase and the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase production for lipolysis. Furthermore, fucoxanthin significantly increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for regulating   synthesis. The results suggest that fucoxanthin is an effective marine nature compound for increasing lipolysis and inhibiting lipogenesis in  induced  cells through promoted Sirt1/AMPK pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Some nutrients, such as ω-9  acids, have been proposed as anticancer agents. Thus, an olein-enriched diet was assayed in a murine model of lung adenocarcinoma (LAC-1) to evaluate neoplastic and paraneoplastic evolution in BALB/c mice. The organic assimilation of dietary  acids was confirmed in  by gas chromatography. This experimental -containing diet increased animal survival and tumour latency (analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method), improving neoplastic evolution and general status, with weak effects on the paraneoplastic syndrome (thymus atrophy, splenomegaly, splenocyte response to mitogen, blood anaemia, and leucocytosis). Tumour lipid oxidation was not involved. Thus, diet enrichment with olein, a natural source of the ω-9 , significantly delayed progression of LAC-1 and increased tumour latency and mice survival. These results support its use in nutritional management of cancer, with further studies being encouraged.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28602867>Effect of Gangjihwan on hepatic steatosis and inflammation in high fat diet-fed mice.</a></h2><p>Gangjihwan (DF), a polyherbal drug composed of Ephedra intermedia Schrenk et C. A. Mayer (Ephedraceae), Lithospermum erythrorhizon Siebold et Zuccarini (Borraginaceae), and Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae), is used to treat obesity in local Korean clinics. The constituents of DF have traditionally been reported to exert anti-obesity and anti-nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) effects. Thus, we investigated the effects of DF on obesity and NAFLD and the underlying mechanisms.DF was extracted with water (DF-FW), 30% ethyl alcohol (DF-GA30), or 70% ethyl alcohol (DF-GA70). The chemical profile of DF was monitored using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet analysis. The effects of DF on indices of obesity and NAFLD in high fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice and HepG2 cells were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Oil red O staining, hematoxylin-eosin staining, toluidine blue staining, and immunohistochemistry.The presence of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, aloe-emodin, and emodin in DF was determined by 3D chromatography using HPLC. Administration of DF-GA70 to HFD-fed obese mice decreased body weight, epididymal adipose tissue mass, and epididymal adipocyte size. DF-GA70 reduced serum levels of free  acids and triglycerides. All three DF extracts lowered serum alanine transaminase levels, hepatic lipid accumulation, and infiltration of macrophages, with the largest effects observed for DF-GA70. DF-GA70 increased mRNA levels of   oxidation genes and decreased mRNA levels of genes for lipogenesis and inflammation in the  of obese mice. Treatment of HepG2 cells with a mixture of  and palmitoleic  induced significant lipid accumulation, whereas all three DF extracts inhibited lipid accumulation. DF-GA70 also altered the expression of lipolytic and lipogenic genes in HepG2 cells.These results indicate that DF inhibits obesity and obesity-induced severe hepatic steatosis and inflammation without any adverse effects and that these effects may be mediated by regulation of the hepatic expression of lipid metabolism and inflammatory genes. These findings suggest that DF is a safe and efficient anti-obesity and anti-nonalcoholic steatohepatosis drug.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

HepG2 cells treated with  (OA) in the presence of SCE exhibited reduced OA-induced lipid accumulation, which was likely mediated by reductions in SREBP-1c expression. SCE attenuated the acetylation of total lysine and H3K9 that was otherwise increased by OA. Male obese mice fed with either a low-fat diet or Western diet exhibited reduced body and  weights when supplemented with 1% SCE. The SCE-mediated attenuation of hepatic lipid accumulation was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of lipogenic genes. SCE also attenuated the expression of acetylated lysine and non-acetylated forms of H3K9 acetylation in the livers of these mice. Taken together, these results suggest that SCE has potential for further development as a novel therapeutic agent for the prevention of steatosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We previously found a positive association between rat mammary tumor levels of the n-6 PUFA arachidonic  (AA) and tumor weight. We examined the roles of the major n-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3), and the major n-6 PUFA, AA, in FASN expression in, and proliferation of, human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.The cells were treated for 48 h with BSA or 60 μM BSA-bound DHA, AA, or  (OA, 18:1n-9), then were incubated with or without estradiol or insulin. Western blot and H-thymidine incorporation assay were used to determine the role of DHA on FASN regulation and MCF-7 cell proliferation.DHA, but neither AA nor OA, inhibits estradiol-induced and insulin-induced expression of the precursor of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (p-SREBP-1), its mature form (m-SREBP-1), and FASN. Estradiol or insulin stimulation increased the pAkt/Akt and pS6/S6 ratios, expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN, and cell proliferation, and these effects were decreased by DHA. The DHA-induced decrease in FASN expression resulted from reduced pAkt/Akt signaling and not pERK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling. In addition, DHA enhanced the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on pAkt signaling and expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN. However, addition of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR signaling pathways, 1 h before addition of estradiol or insulin increased the pAkt/Akt ratio and FASN expression, and this effect was inhibited by addition of DHA 48 h before rapamycin.We conclude that, in MCF-7 cells, DHA inhibits pAKT signaling and thus expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN and cell proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29506628>The determination of the effect of some 1,3,4 thiadiazole derivatives on biochemical content ( Acids, Sterols, Lipophilic Vitamins) in rat .</a></h2><p>Thiadiazole derivatives and its metal compounds have antibacterial, antifungal, antitumoral, antiproliferative and antioxidant properties.

The experiment was conducted with the use of 80 male Wistar rats with initial body weight 125±5 g. Selected animals (n=50) were divided into 5 groups according to their activity in tests «Open field» (OF) and «Elevated plus-maze» (EPM). The animals of control group 1st were not exposed to physiological tests - this was an intact control group. The animals of control groups 1st and 2nd were treated with standard half-synthetic diets for 30 days [381 kcal/100 g of dry food, 20.1% of casein on calories, 10% of fat (the mixture of lard and sunflower oil in 1:1 ratio)]. In the diet of 3d group animals the sunflower oil (50% of fat in the diet) was substituted with lipid module, enriched with ASTA (4.0±0.3 mg/day/kg b.w.); in the diet of group 4 animals - with lipid module, enriched with PG (79.0±2.0 mg/day/kg b.w.); in the diet of group 5 animals - with lipid module, enriched with ASTA and PG (the same doses). The evaluation of anxiety level and total exploration activity was conducted in «elevated plus maze» test. On the 31st day of experiment, animals were exposed to forced swim test for evaluation of their physical endurance and capacity in the conditions of high stress.The introduction into the animal diet of lipid module, enriched with PG and/or ASTA had pronounced hypolipidemic effect, lowered total serum cholesterol against a background of decrease in low-density lypoproteins (LDL) level. The concentration of ω-3 polyunsaturated   (PUFA) - docosahexaenoic  in  cells of animals treated with lipid module enriched with PG and/or ASTA increased more the 3 times, while ω-6 linoleic  decreased twice. The consumption of enriched with ASTA lipid module inhibited the increase in blood corticosterone level after stress (exhausting physical exercise) and lowered it to the control animals values, thus showing adaptogenic effect. The animals treated with lipid module enriched with ASTA (group 3) spent significantly less time in open arms of the maze in comparison with the first test, what may show the increase in anxiety level. The introduction of PG into lipid module neutralized this effect. The forced swim test with load showed no increase in working ability and endurance of animals of all tested groups.The further study of adaptogenic action of PG in combination with ASTA in the composition of lipid module compared to the similar effect of traditional phospholipids is of special interest.Copyright© GEOTAR-Media Publishing Group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29467759>Magnolol Alleviates Inflammatory Responses and Lipid Accumulation by AMP-Activated Protein Kinase-Dependent Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α Activation.</a></h2><p>Magnolol (MG) is a kind of lignin isolated from , which serves several different biological functions, such as antifungal, anticancer, antioxidant, and hepatoprotective functions. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of MG against  (OA)-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammatory damage in HepG2 cells and in a tyloxapol (Ty)-induced hyperlipidemia mouse model. Our findings indicated that MG can effectively inhibit OA-stimulated tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) secretion, reactive oxygen species generation, and triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Further study manifested that MG significantly suppressed OA-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways and that these inflammatory responses can be negated by pretreatment with inhibitors of extracellular regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (U0126 and SP600125, respectively). In addition, MG dramatically upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) translocation and reduced sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) protein synthesis and excretion, both of which are dependent upon the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and AKT kinase (AKT). However, MG suspended the activation of PPARα expression and was thus blocked by pretreatment with LY294002 and compound c (specific inhibitors of AKT and AMPK). Furthermore, MG clearly alleviated serum TG and total cholesterol release; upregulated AKT, AMPK, and PPARα expression; suppressed SREBP-1c generation; and alleviated hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia in Ty-induced hyperlipidemia mice. Taken together, these results suggest that MG exerts protective effects against steatosis, hyperlipidemia, and the underlying mechanism, which may be closely associated with AKT/AMPK/PPARα activation and MAPK/NF-κB/SREBP-1c inhibition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30324559>Melatonin Modulates lipid Metabolism in HepG2 Cells Cultured in High Concentrations of : AMPK Pathway Activation may Play an Important Role.</a></h2><p>Melatonin exists as an active ingredient in several foods and has been reported to inhibit  disease in animals; however, its molecular mechanisms are not well elucidated. Herein, we explored effects of melatonin on lipid accumulation induced by  in HepG2 cells and characterized the underlying molecular mechanisms. Pretreatment with melatonin (0.1-0.3 mM) significantly inhibited accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol induced by incubating HepG2 cells with high concentrations of  ( overload) (p < 0.05). Melatonin pretreatment induced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), causing their activation and inactivation, respectively. Expression levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα) and its target gene carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase 1 (CPT1), which are associated with lipolysis, were upregulated by melatonin, whereas expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c),   synthase (FAS), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), which are associated with lipogenesis, were downregulated. Melatonin did not change expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR) and SREBP-2. Melatonin inhibits lipid accumulation induced by  overload in HepG2 cells.

Longyan females (1080) with similar BW at 17 wk of age were randomly assigned to 6 treatment groups, each consisting of 6 replicates of 30 birds. The basal diet (I) was a typical corn-soybean ration while the experimental diets (II to VI) substituted corn DDGS for soybean meal and wheat bran and a small reduction of corn. The level of substitution in diets (II to VI) was 6%, 12%, 18%, 24% and 30%. The experiment lasted for 18 wk. Average egg weight decreased linearly as the level of corn DDGS inclusion increased (P < 0.001). Haugh unit, albumen weight, and proportion declined as linear responses to corn DDGS substitution (P < 0.05), but yolk color linearly increased (P < 0.001); the proportions of  (C18:1) and total monounsaturated  acids in egg yolk linearly decreased with increasing corn DDGS and many of the key polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) like linoleic (C18:2n-6), arachidonic (C20:4n-6) and α-linolenic (C18:3n-3) acids linearly increased (P < 0.001), but not those of eicosapentaenoic (C20:5n-3) and docoshexaenoic (C22:6n-3) acids. The PUFAs n-6/n-3 ratio linearly increased with increasing corn DDGS level (P < 0.001). Increasing corn DDGS linearly increased hepatic expression of GPX1, HO-1, and Nrf2 and hepatic activity of GSH-Px and the  content of MDA (P < 0.001). There were no treatment effects on egg production, egg mass, feed conversion ratio, eggshell thickness, strength, and yolk cholesterol content (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the current study indicates that the use of corn DDGS is possible as a replacement, primarily for soybean meal at levels up to 18% in the diets of laying ducks without affecting laying performance, egg quality, and antioxidant status. Increasing amounts of corn DDGS linearly increased egg yolk concentrations of key  acids like like C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 and the antioxidant enzyme activity of GSH-Px through the Nrf2 pathway to avoid oxidative stress.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28712532>Influence of different intravenous lipid emulsions on growth, development and laboratory and clinical outcomes in hospitalised paediatric patients: A systematic review.</a></h2><p>Fats in the form of lipid emulsions (LEs) are an integral part of intravenous nutrition. The   composition of different LEs varies. The exact composition of a LE may influence cell and tissue function and clinical outcome. Currently, it is not clear which LE might be best for paediatric patients. We conducted a systematic review of the effects of different intravenous LEs in hospitalised paediatric patients.Randomised controlled trials published in a peer reviewed journal, written in the English language, and comparing two or more different intravenous LEs in hospitalised paediatric patients were included. Data on outcomes of relevance (growth, development, laboratory and clinical outcomes) were extracted, collated and interpreted.Thirty-one articles involving 1522 infants or children were included. Most outcomes were not affected by the nature of the LE used. LEs containing fish oil, a source of omega-3  acids, improved outcome of retinopathy of prematurity, decreased  cholestasis and increased blood omega-3   levels. LEs containing olive oil increased blood  level and had a cholesterol lowering effect.Blood  acids are influenced by the nature of the intravenous LE used in hospitalised paediatric patients. Most studies suggest limited differences in relevant laboratory or clinical outcomes or in growth in paediatric patients receiving different LEs, although several studies do find benefits from including fish oil or olive oil. There is a need for larger trials to fully evaluate the effects of the available LE types in hospitalised paediatric patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD by regulating the level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1c, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Increased evidence indicates that the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway is a key pathway to regulate hepatic cellular lipid metabolism. UDCA may regulate the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway to ameliorate hepatic lipid metabolism.To investigate the functional mechanism of UDCA in an  (OA)-induced cellular model of NAFLD.The cellular model of NAFLD was established using OA and treated with UDCA. First, the best concentration of UDCA was selected. For the best time-dependent assay, cells were stimulated with OA only or co-treated with OA and 2 mmol/L UDCA for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Oil red O staining was used to observe the accumulation of intracellular lipids, while the intracellular contents of triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were detected by enzymatic methods. Meanwhile, the expression levels of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot.In the NAFLD cell model established with LO2 cells induced using OA, lipid accumulation was obvious. UDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation at different concentrations (especially 2 mmol/L) and decreased cell growth ability at different time points. The biochemical parameters like ALT, AST, and GGT were significant improved by UDCA. UDCA treatment vividly repressed the activation of AKT, mTOR, and CRTC2 and the expression of nSREBP-1 in LO2 cells induced with OA.Our findings demonstrate the effect of UDCA in improving NAFLD. UDCA attenuates OA-induced hepatic steatosis mainly by regulation of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signal transduction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30753863>Acetaminophen aggravates fat accumulation in NAFLD by inhibiting autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR pathway.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic  disease which affects millions of people worldwide. Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute  failure. In this study, APAP (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) were employed on mice fed with a high-fat diet, and APAP (2, 4, 8 mM) were cultured with L02 cells in the presence of alcohol and . APAP treatment significantly aggravated hepatic lipid accumulation, increased the serum levels of triglyceride (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and increased hepatic lipid accumulation in H&E and Oil red O staining results. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) found fewer number of autophagosomes in APAP (100 mg/kg) treated group. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the intensity of hepatic mTOR was increased and AMPK was decreased in 200 mg/kg APAP treated group. Western blot analysis showed APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, while increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, respectively. In vitro study showed APAP treatment obviously increased TG activities in cell supernatant, and Oil red O staining had the same results. Western blot analysis demonstrated APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, but rapamycin treatment significantly reversed these effects of APAP. In conclusion, therapeutic dosages of APAP aggravates fat accumulation in NAFLD, the potential mechanism might be involved in inhibiting autophagy associated with the AMPK/mTOR pathway, and patients with NAFLD should use a lower dose of APAP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Scutellarin is a flavonoid glycoside having antioxidative stress activity. Our current study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism of scutellarin ameliorating NAFLD. Scutellarin treatment was applied to male C57BL/6 mice maintained on a high-fat diet (HFD) and HepG2 cells challenged with . The antioxidation biochemical indicators and lipid levels in the  and cells were detected by kits.  pathology was observed by light microscope, Oil Red O staining, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) and western blot assays were employed to detect the mRNA and protein levels of various antioxidative-related genes in the presence or absence of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ); inhibitor GW9662. Our results showed that scutellarin could significantly reduce blood lipid levels and enhance antioxidative capacities in both the models. In addition, scutellarin treatment conspicuously activated PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α), nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor (Nrf2), haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase one (NQO1), while it significantly inhibited nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) at both the mRNA and protein levels. However, after interfered by GW9662, scutellarin effect was significantly decreased.

However, its potential to cause toxicity remains unclear. To examine the potential toxicity and associated mechanism, elemicin was administered to mice for 3 weeks and serum metabolites were examined. Enlarged livers were observed in elemicin-treated mice, which were accompanied by lower ratios of unsaturated- and saturated-lysophosphatidylcholines in plasma, and inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 () mRNA expression in . Administration of the unsaturated    reduced the toxicity of 1'-hydroxylelemicin, the primary oxidative metabolite of elemicin, while treatment with the SCD1 inhibitor A939572 potentiated its toxicity. Furthermore, the in vitro use of recombinant human CYPs and chemical inhibition of CYPs in human  microsomes revealed that CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 were the primary CYPs responsible for elemicin bioactivation. Notably, the CYP1A2 inhibitor α-naphthoflavone could attenuate the susceptibility of mice to elemicin-induced hepatomegaly. This study revealed that metabolic activation of elemicin leads to SCD1 inhibition in , suggesting that upregulation of SCD1 may serve as potential intervention strategy for elemicin-induced toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772307>Nitro- acids protect against steatosis and fibrosis during development of nonalcoholic  disease in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are reaching global epidemic proportions. Lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools and effective therapies constitute two of the major hurdles for a bona fide treatment and a reversal of NASH progression and/or regression of the disease. Nitro- (OA-NO) has been proven effective in multiple experimental models of inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, the potential benefit of in vivo administration of OA-NO to treat advanced NAFLD was tested herein in a model of long-term NASH diet-induced  damage.Non-invasive imaging (e.g. photoacustic-ultrasound (PA-US)) was pursued to establish advanced experimental model of NASH in mice in which both steatosis and fibrosis were diagnosed prior experimental therapy with OA-NO. Experimental controls included equimolar amounts of the non-nitrated  (OA). CLAMS and NMR-based analysis was used for energy metabolism.CLAMS and NMR-based analysis demonstrates that OA-NO improves body composition and energy metabolism and inhibits hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Photoacoustic-ultrasound imaging revealed a robust inhibition of  steatosis and fibrosis by OA-NO. RNA-sequencing analysis uncovered inflammation and fibrosis as major pathways suppressed by OA-NO administration, as well as regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis pathways, with a robust inhibition of SREBP1 proteolytic activation and subsequent lipogenesis gene expression by OA-NO. These results were further supported by histological analysis and quantification of lipid accumulation, lobular inflammation (F4/80 staining) and fibrosis (collagen deposition, αSMA staining) as well as established parameters of  damage (ALT). In vitro studies indicate that OA-NO inhibits TG biosynthesis and accumulation in hepatocytes and inhibits fibrogenesis in human stellate cells.OA-NO improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis and may constitute an effective therapeutic approach against advanced NAFLD that warrants further clinical evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

One group of substances with a potential use in the treatment of NAFLD are plant polyphenols, represented by resveratrol. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on steatosis and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. The steatosis of cells was carried out using free  acids:  or palmitic  and their mixtures.

HepG2 cells were treated with 0.5 mM  for 48 h to induce a  cell model. Then, the cells were exposed to various concentrations of ginkgolide C for 24 h. Staining with Oil Red O and the fluorescent dye BODIPY 493/503 revealed that ginkgolide C significantly reduced excessive lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Ginkgolide C decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c to block the expression of   synthase. Ginkgolide C treatment also promoted the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase and the phosphorylation level of hormone-sensitive lipase to enhance the decomposition of triglycerides. In addition, ginkgolide C stimulated CPT-1 to activate   β-oxidation, significantly increased sirt1 and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for suppressed   synthesis in hepatocytes.

This study was performed to clone and characterize the full-length cDNA sequences of nine key autolysosome-related genes ( and ) from yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco. The expression of these genes and the transcriptional responses to a high-fat diet and  acids (FAs) (palmitic  (PA) and  (OA)) were investigated. The mRNAs of these genes could be detected in heart, , muscle, spleen, brain, mesenteric adipose tissue, intestine, kidney and ovary, but varied with the tissues. In the , the mRNA levels of the nine autolysosome-related genes were lower in fish fed a high-fat diet than those fed the control, indicating that a high-fat diet inhibited formation of autolysosomes. Palmitic  (a saturated FA) significantly inhibited the formation of autolysosomes at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h incubation. In contrast,  (an unsaturated FA) significantly induced the formation of autolysosomes at 12 h, but inhibited them at 24 h. At 48 h, the effects of OA incubation on autolysosomes were OA concentration-dependent in primary hepatocytes of P. fulvidraco.

In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the impact of gene-nutrient interactions in  and gut diseases, by taking advantage of the role of SCD1 and its product  in the modulation of different hepatic and intestinal metabolic pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024691>Comparison of fish and oil supplements for a better understanding of the role of fat level and other food constituents in determining bioaccessibility.</a></h2><p>In order to investigate the effects of fat level and protein and other components on lipid bioaccessibility, the bioaccessibility of total lipids and particular  acids (FAs) of fish samples with different fat levels (5.4% w/w, 10.2% w/w, and 16.6% w/w) and cod  oil supplement in different quantities (82, 154, 313, 604, and 1,027 mg) was determined by an in vitro digestion model. Digestion of the fish and oil (up to 154 mg) samples as measured by TAG disappearance was complete. Lipolysis was impaired by high amounts of oil (313 mg and higher). Bioaccessible FA profiles had similarities with the initial (before digestion) FA profiles. However, total MUFA and  contents were higher in the bioaccessible fraction. The bioaccessibility of EPA and DHA was generally lower than that of  and total MUFA. Fat level did not affect FAs' bioaccessibility. On the other hand, protein and other components may have interfered in lipid bioaccessibility and it was found that the reduction of bioaccessibility was stronger when the ratio of the lipid fraction to the nonlipid fraction (mainly protein) was smaller.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497874>Delayed intervention with a novel SGLT2 inhibitor NGI001 suppresses diet-induced metabolic dysfunction and nonalcoholic  disease in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is closely related to metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream   synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

HepG2 cells were treated with the sera from rats fed with low-, moderate-or high-dose HGT (HGT sera) or sera of rats fed with fenofibrate (fenofibrate sera), followed by treatment with 1 mmol/L FFAs for 24 h to induce hepatic steatosis. Oil red O staining was used to observe the distribution of lipid droplets in the cells. The biochemical parameters including triglyceride (TG), lactated hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured using a commercial kit. The morphological changes of the ER in the cells were observed using transmission electron microscopy. The protein/mRNA expressions of ER stress-related signal molecules including GRP78, PERK, p-PERK, ATF6, ATF4, CASPASE-12, CHOP, XBP-1, PKC, and p-PKC-δ were detected using Western blotting and/or quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The changes in the protein expressions of GRP78, p-PERK, CASPASE-12 and CHOP were also detected in cells with transient transfection of PKC-δ siRNA for PKC-δ knockdown.Compared with the control cells, the cells treated with FFAs showed significantly increased levels of TG, AST, and ALT ( &lt; 0.05). Compared with FFAs-treated cells, the cells pretreated with HGT sera or fenofibrate sera all showed significantly decreased TG, AST and ALT levels ( &lt; 0.05), reduced accumulation of the lipid droplets ( &lt; 0.05), and lowered protein or mRNA expression levels of GRP78, p-PERK, ATF6, ATF4, CHOP, CASPASE-12, XBP-1 and p-PKC-δ ( &lt; 0.05). PKC-δ knockdown caused significantly reduced protein expressions of GRP78, p-PERK, CASPASE-12 and CHOP in the cells with FFA-induced hepatic steatosis ( &lt; 0.001); treatment with high-dose HGT serum more significantly reduced the expressions of GRP78 ( &lt; 0.001) and P-PERK ( &lt; 0.01) in FFAs-induced cells with PKC-δ knockdown.HGT serum can effectively prevent FFAs-induced steatosis in HepG2 cells by alleviating ER stress, in which PKC-δ may act as an important target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200402>[Insulin resistance is an alimentary deficiency of energy substrates (glucose) in the biological reaction of exotrophy and aphysiology compensation by  acids via the biological reaction of endothrophy.]</a></h2><p>The deficiency of energy substrates in the biological function of trophology and biological reaction of exotrophy is formed by two factors. Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of palmitic   (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of palmitic triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes palmitic TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce  nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with palmitic type of FA metabolism into herbivorous dry land-living species with  type metabolism of FA. The IR syndrome can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species.

One fenugreek TG was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation and administrated to surviving diabetic rats. The free  acids percentage as well as, the peroxide, the saponification and the iodine values were 2%, 12 mequiv. O/kg of oil, 189 (mg KOH/g) and 110 (g/100 g of oil), respectively. Linolenic  (C 26.14%), Linoleic  (C 41.13%) and  (C 17.07%) were the dominant  acids in the FSO. β-sitosterol was the major sterol (85.3%) in the FSO. LnLnO (17.1%), LLL (16.6%), OLL and OOLn (8.4%), were the abundant triglycerides. The hexane extract of fenugreek seed (exhibiting the powerful inhibitory activity against alpha-amylase) was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation affording one fenugreek TG: (11Z)-11- eicosenoic  2, 3- bis[((9Z, 12Z, 15Z)-1-oxo-9, 12, 15-octadecatrien-1-yl)oxy] propyl ester. In diabetic rats, the administration of the fenugreek TG inhibited α-amylase activity in small intestine by 36% as compared to untreated diabetic rats. Moreover, fenugreek TG increased insulin sensibility which leads to decrease in blood glucose level by 43%. In addition, this study demonstrated that administration of pure fenugreek TG to diabetic rats ameliorated the glycogen rate in  and muscle. In addition, the administration of fenugreek TG reverted back the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme respectively in kidney and plasma by 33 and 29%. Interestingly, the fenugreek TG inhibited lipase activity in small intestine by 33% which leads to the regulation of lipid profile. Moreover, the fenugreek TG protected -kidney function evidenced by histological study. In conclusion, our finding demonstrates that the administration of fenugreek TG to diabetic rats can make it a potential candidate for industrial application as a pharmacological agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29409806>Vitamin A deficiency induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis in pancreatic islet cells: Implications of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1-mediated  synthesis.</a></h2><p>Previously, we reported that vitamin A deficiency resulted in the reduction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and monounsaturated   (MUFA) levels, which corroborated with attenuation of high fructose-induced hepatic steatosis. Here, we aimed at assessing the effect of vitamin A deficiency on SCD1, MUFA levels and their impact on pancreas' structure and functions. Male weanling Wistar rats fed one of the four diets, namely control (Con), vitamin A-deficient (VAD), highfructose (HFr) and vitamin A-deficient diet with highfructose (VADHFr) for 16 weeks period. Compared to the control, feeding of VAD diet (alone or with HFr) resulted in pancreatic intra-islet vessel dilation and reduced plasma insulin, glucagon and C-peptide levels, however, glucose levels decreased only in VADHFr group. In line with plasma levels, VAD diet-fed animals displayed lower immunostaining for insulin and glucagon, which corroborated with increased apoptotic staining observed in the islet regions, possibly due to increased cellular stress, as indicated by high immunostaining for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and CCAAT/Enhancer-binding protein homologues protein (CHOP). On the other hand, it significantly decreased the SCD1 protein, which corroborated with reduced MUFA levels, particularly,  (C18:1), when compared to the control and HFr groups. In conclusion, chronic vitamin A deficiency altered the structure and functions of pancreas by diminishing the islet cells, possibly by inducing cellular stress-mediated apoptosis and decreasing SCD1-mediated  (C18:1) synthesis. Thus, the data suggest that unlike , the reduction in SCD1 and MUFA levels in the pancreas exerts deleterious effects on its functions and perturb the overall cellular metabolism.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In a model of steatosis using HepG2 hepatocytes, exposure of the cells to 1.5 mM  (OA) for 24 h caused steatosis and distorted cell morphology, induced the expression of mRNA for enzymes that are involved in lipogenesis and   oxidation ( and ), and impaired indices of aerobic energy metabolism ( mRNA expression, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and galactose-supported ATP production). Co-treatment with 10 µM of selected polyphenols all strongly protected against the steatosis and changes in cell morphology. All polyphenols, except cyanidin, inhibited the effects on  and  and further increased  expression, suggesting a shift toward increased β-oxidation. Resveratrol, quercetin, catechin, and cyanidin, however not kuromanin or berberine, ameliorated the decreases in MMP and galactose-derived ATP. Berberine was unique in worsening the decrease in galactose-derived ATP. In further investigations of the mechanisms involved, resveratrol, catechin, and berberine increased SIRT1 enzyme activity and p-AMPKα protein, which are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. In conclusion, selected polyphenols all protected against steatosis with similar effectiveness, however through different mechanisms that increased aerobic lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29738693>Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) Catalyzes Lipid Peroxidation of -Induced HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a chronic hepatic disease associated with excessive accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes. As the disease progresses, oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the development of hepatic lipid peroxidation. Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), a subtype of the cytochrome P450 family, has been shown to be a vital modulator in production of reactive oxygen species. However, the exact role of CYP1A1 in NAFLD is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CYP1A1 on lipid peroxidation in  (OA)-treated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). We found that the expression of CYP1A1 is elevated in OA-stimulated HepG2 cells. The results of siRNA transfection analysis indicated that CYP1A1-siRNA inhibited the lipid peroxidation in OA-treated HepG2 cells. Additionally, compared with siRNA-transfected and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)-OA-induced HepG2 cells, overexpression of CYP1A1 by BaP further accelerated the lipid peroxidation in OA-treated HepG2 cells. These observations reveal a regulatory role of CYP1A1 in  lipid peroxidation and imply CYP1A1 as a potential therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30768879>[The person in philogenesis is not (omnivores), but the herbivores with the carnivores past and the fuzzy future. Biological function of trophology (nutrition) in ontogenesis.]</a></h2><p>According to the phylogenetic theory of general pathology, seven biological functions have been formed over billions of years. 1. biological function of trophology, nutrition; 2. homeostasis function; 3. biological function of endoecology; 4. function of adaptation; 5. function of the continuation of the species; 6. function of locomotion and 7. cognitive biological function, including intelligence. Millions of years in life consistently in the waters of several oceans, all the ancestors of man were carnivorous (Carnivores), fish-eating mammals. When the ocean retreated and the carnivorous (fish-eating) were on land, each individual privatized a "piece" of the ocean. Animals transformed it ito a pool of intercellular medium in vivo. The biological role of the late in the phylogeny of insulin is the formation of new biological functions in vivo. The action of insulin has transformed the carnivorous (fish-eating) ocean into herbivorous (Herbivores) species on land. There was it by synthesis in vivo from exogenous glucose of  acids (FA). Regulatory action of insulin was the directed conversion of exogenous glucose into ω-6 C18: 1 cis- FA. Insulin late in phylogeny expressed the synthesis of new, conjugated enzymes: it is palmitoyl-CoA-elongase and stearyl-CoAdesaturase. Two enzymes synthesized FAs along the way: synthesized in situ de novo, from exogenous glucose, C16: 0 palmitic  → C18: 0 stearic  → ω-6 C18: 1 cis- without accumulation of stearic FA. Insulin is not converted into an  FA exogenous palmitic  from carnivorous food. On land, the action of insulin transformed the species Homo sapiens, into a herbivore, but with carnivorous, fish-eating, past. The idea of a person as omnivorous (Omnivor) - nonsense; such forms of nature did not form. Violation of the function of nutrition, the biological reaction of exotrophy (external nutrition), is the etiological and pathogenetic basis of the seven metabolic pandemics, the diseases of civilization. 1. Atherosclerosis and atheromatosis; 2. metabolic arterial hypertension; 3. metabolic syndrome; 4. obesity; 5. syndrome of insulin resistance; 6. non-alcoholic  disease and 7. endogenous hyperuricemia. The primary prevention of metabolic pandemics in the biological function of nutrition, in the biological reactions of exo-and endotrophy, will allow us to understand the theoretical bases and implementation of preventive actions that will determine the characteristics of nutrition in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28830448>Significant decrease of saturation index in erythrocytes membrane from subjects with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).</a></h2><p>The lipidomic profiling of erythrocyte membranes is expected to provide a peculiar scenario at molecular level of metabolic and nutritional pathways which may influence the lipid balance and the adaptation and homeostasis of the organism.

Black radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. niger) extract (BRE) can lower the risk of this disease. The hepatoprotective effect of BRE containing 3-(E)-(methylthio)methylene-2-pyrrolidinethione was evaluated in human hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells and in rat livers with carbon tetrachloride (CCl)-induced hepatic injury. BRE was administered at 125, 250, 500, and 1000 μg/mL to the -induced HepG2 cells. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into seven groups: the control group, BRE group, CCl group, and BRE + CCl group. BRE was administered orally at 125, 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day once daily for 7 consecutive days, followed by a single oral treatment of 1.5 mL/kg CCl. Inhibition of lipid accumulation, serum markers of  injury, histological evaluations, levels of oxidative stress related enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants in HepG2 cells and  tissue were investigated. The protein expression of main  P450 isoenzymes such as cytochrome p450(CYP)2E1, the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2(Nrf-2) and heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) were also studied. BRE has an inhibitory effect on lipid accumulation and caused acute hepatotoxicity manifested by increased levels of lipid peroxidation, serum alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase with corresponding histopathological changes and high levels of oxidative stress. BRE treatment significantly increased the level of CYP2E1, Nrf-2, and HO-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, 3-(E)-(methylthio)methylene-2-pyrrolidinethione significantly increased radical-scavenging effects and the expression of Nrf-2 in -treated HepG2 cells. These results suggest that BRE treatment reduces lipid accumulation in -induced steatosis of HepG2 cells, and has a hepatoprotective effect against CCl-induced  injury in rats, possibly through Nrf-2/HO-1-mediated antioxidant effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28659743> inhibition of lipid accumulation induced by  and  pharmacokinetics of chitosan microspheres (CTMS) and chitosan-capsaicin microspheres (CCMS).</a></h2><p>Chitosan and capsaicin are compounds extracted from natural products and have been indicated to lower body weight and prevent .

A pharmacokinetic study indicated that CTMS and CCMS were distributed in almost all of the measured tissues, especially  and kidney, and that their absorption was better than those of chitosan and capsaicin. Simultaneously, the prolonged circulating half-lives, the lower clearance and higher plasma concentration of CTMS and CCMS showed that their bioavailability was effectively enhanced.

Due to the growing economic burden of NAFLD on public health, it has become an emergent target for clinical intervention. DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation in L02 cells after palmitic / treatment. We demonstrate that hepatocyte specific DUSP12-deficient mice exhibit high-fat diet (HFD)-induced and high-fat high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and  steatosis and decreased insulin sensitivity. Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation. At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic metabolism. DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit lipogenesis under high-fat conditions. Conclusion: DUSP12 acts as a positive regulator in hepatic steatosis and offers potential therapeutic opportunities for NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic  is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits lipid storage in the  through the inhibition of free   formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and  (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (2-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased lipid accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was not inhibited by metformin.

The prior studies have shown that ASD alleviates hepatic steatosis targeted at the modulation of autophagy and exerts hepatoprotective effects through mitochondria. However, it is still unclear which signal transduction pathway that ASD increase autophagy and protect the mitochondria. The purpose of this paper was to explore the mechanisms through which ASD alleviates hepatic steatosis. ASD significantly reduced lipid accumulation in BRL cells. Furthermore, ASD significantly increased the mitophagy acting as increase the colocalization between mitochondria and punctate EGFP-LC3. ASD treatment increased the expression of BNip3, phospho-AMPK, prevented  (OA) induced LC3-II and phospho-mTOR expression. These effects were similar to the effects cotreatment with rapamycin. ASD treatment could not attenuate the expression of BNip3 blocked by chloroquine (CQ) or siRNA-mediated knockdown of BNip3.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide peptide (GLPP) has therapeutic effect on NAFLD.Ob/ ob mouse model and ApoC3 transgenic mouse model were used for exploring the effect of GLPP on NAFLD. Key metabolic pathways and enzymes were identified by metabolomics combining with KEGG and PIUmet analyses and key enzymes were detected by Western blot. Hepatosteatosis models of HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes were used to further confirm the therapeutic effect of GLPP on NAFLD.GLPP administrated for a month alleviated hepatosteatosis, dyslipidemia,  dysfunction and  insulin resistance. Pathways of glycerophospholipid metabolism,   metabolism and primary bile  biosynthesis were involved in the therapeutic effect of GLPP on NAFLD. Detection of key enzymes revealed that GLPP reversed low expression of CYP7A1, CYP8B1, FXR, SHP and high expression of FGFR4 in ob/ob mice and ApoC3 mice. Besides, GLPP inhibited   synthesis by reducing the expression of SREBP1c, FAS and ACC via a FXR-SHP dependent mechanism. Additionally, GLPP reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets and the content of TG in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes induced by  and palmitic .GLPP significantly improves NAFLD via regulating bile  synthesis dependent on FXR-SHP/FGF pathway, which finally inhibits   synthesis, indicating that GLPP might be developed as a therapeutic drug for NAFLD.© 2018 The Author(s).

Five isonitrogenous diets (35% protein) with graded lipid levels of 0%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 12% were fed to 225 lemon fin barb hybrid fingerlings (4.3 ? 0.5 g), which were randomly and equally distributed into twelve 60 l aquaria. The diets were randomly assigned to the aquaria in triplicates, and the feeding experiment was conducted for 10 weeks. Fish were fed at 5% body weight and the feeding ration was adjusted fortnightly. The weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of fish fed 4% dietary lipid were significantly superior (P<0.05) than those fed with other diets, except for 6% lipid. Except for whole body moisture content, there were significant differences (P<0.05) between whole body proximate composition and nutrient retentions of fish fed with different test diets. The results showed that palmitic  was the main saturated   (SFA),  was the predominant MUFA while arachidic  and docosahexanoic were the major PUFAs in the muscle and  tissue of fish. The n-3/n-6 ratio ranged from 0.66 to 2.65.

The transient nature of the gene expression of mRNA would be expected to be beneficial for avoiding undesired side effects. Since the mRNA is a vulnerable molecule, a development of a carrier that can deliver the mRNA to the cytoplasm has a high priority. We report herein on the development of a system for delivering mRNA to the inflammatory lesion in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model. We modulated molecular structures of an ionizable lipid, an SS-cleavable and pH-activated lipid-like material (ssPalm). Among the  acids investigated,  scaffolds (ssPalmO) appeared to be more biocompatible than either myristic  or linoleic  scaffolds with the colitis model. The structural modification of the hydrophilic head groups from linear tertiary amines to piperazine rings (ssPalmO-Paz4-C2) resulted in a more than 10-fold higher increasing in the transgene activity in inflammatory colon. The most notable observation is that the transgene activity in the inflammatory colon is significantly higher than that in , the major clearance organ of lipid nanoparticles. Collectively, the ssPalmO-Paz4-C2 represents a promising material for the delivery of an mRNA to inflammatory lesions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261661>Fc Gamma Receptor IIb Expressed in Hepatocytes Promotes Lipid Accumulation and Gluconeogenesis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is characterized by ectopic lipid accumulation in the , usually combined with hepatic insulin resistance. Fc-gamma receptor-IIb (FcγRIIb) and its ligand are reported to be associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

In this study, we identified the expression of FcγRIIb in primary cultured mouse hepatocytes: FcγRIIb was upregulated in response to  (OA) in a dose dependent manner. FcγRIIb knockdown using shRNA suppressed the lipid and triglyceride accumulation, and mRNA expression of , , , , and  in OA-treated HepG2 cells. FcγRIIb deficiency mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) had significantly lower  weight and  to body weight ratio, as well as less triglyceride accumulation in the livers. In glycometabolism, FcγRIIb hindered insulin-induced phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO1, and in turn upregulated  and  mRNA expression, suggesting that FcγRIIb promotes gluconeogenesis by suppressing the AKT/FOXO1// pathway in hepatocytes. This study reveals a novel role for FcγRIIb in regulating lipid metabolism and glycometabolism, and provides a new therapeutic target to improve NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28851448>Dietary arachidonic  increases deleterious effects of amyloid-β oligomers on learning abilities and expression of AMPA receptors: putative role of the ACSL4-cPLA balance.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated  acids play a crucial role in neuronal function, and the modification of these compounds in the brain could have an impact on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Despite the fact that arachidonic  is the second foremost polyunsaturated   besides docosahexaenoic , its role and the regulation of its transfer and mobilization in the brain are poorly known.Two groups of 39 adult male BALB/c mice were fed with an arachidonic -enriched diet or an -enriched diet, respectively, for 12 weeks. After 10 weeks on the diet, mice received intracerebroventricular injections of either NaCl solution or amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) oligomers. Y-maze and Morris water maze tests were used to evaluate short- and long-term memory. At 12 weeks on the diet, mice were killed, and blood, , and brain samples were collected for lipid and protein analyses.We found that the administration of an arachidonic -enriched diet for 12 weeks induced short-term memory impairment and increased deleterious effects of Aβ oligomers on learning abilities. These cognitive alterations were associated with modifications of expression of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic  receptors, postsynaptic density protein 95, and glial fibrillary acidic protein in mouse cortex or hippocampus by the arachidonic -enriched diet and Aβ oligomer administration. This diet also led to an imbalance between the main ω-6  acids and the ω-3  acids in favor of the first one in erythrocytes and the  as well as in the hippocampal and cortical brain structures. In the cortex, the dietary arachidonic  also induced an increase of arachidonic -containing phospholipid species in phosphatidylserine class, whereas intracerebroventricular injections modified several arachidonic - and docosahexaenoic -containing species in the four phospholipid classes. Finally, we observed that dietary arachidonic  decreased the expression of the neuronal form of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase 4 in the hippocampus and increased the cytosolic phospholipase A activation level in the cortices of the mice.Dietary arachidonic  could amplify Aβ oligomer neurotoxicity. Its consumption could constitute a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease in humans and should be taken into account in future preventive strategies. Its deleterious effect on cognitive capacity could be linked to the balance between arachidonic -mobilizing enzymes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28732092>Dietary  regulates hepatic lipogenesis through a  X receptor-dependent signaling.</a></h2><p>Olive oil consumption is beneficial for health as it is associated with a decreased prevalence of cancer and cardiovascular diseases.  is, by far, the most abundant component of olive oil.

Its pathogenesis is multifactorial, but twin and familial studies indicate significant heritability, which is not fully explained by currently known genetic susceptibility loci. Notably, mutations in genes encoding nuclear lamina proteins, including lamins, cause lipodystrophy syndromes that include NAFLD. We hypothesized that variants in lamina-associated proteins predispose to NAFLD and used a candidate gene-sequencing approach to test for variants in 10 nuclear lamina-related genes in a cohort of 37 twin and sibling pairs: 21 individuals with and 53 without NAFLD. Twelve heterozygous sequence variants were identified in four lamina-related genes (ZMPSTE24, TMPO, SREBF1, SREBF2). The majority of NAFLD patients (>90%) had at least one variant compared to <40% of controls (P < 0.0001). When only insertions/deletions and changes in conserved residues were considered, the difference between the groups was similarly striking (>80% versus <25%; P < 0.0001). Presence of a lamina variant segregated with NAFLD independently of the PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism. Several variants were found in TMPO, which encodes the lamina-associated polypeptide-2 (LAP2) that has not been associated with  disease. One of these, a frameshift insertion that generates truncated LAP2, abrogated lamin-LAP2 binding, caused LAP2 mislocalization, altered endogenous lamin distribution, increased lipid droplet accumulation after  treatment in transfected cells, and led to cytoplasmic association with the ubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1.Several variants in nuclear lamina-related genes were identified in a cohort of twins and siblings with NAFLD; one such variant, which results in a truncated LAP2 protein and a dramatic phenotype in cell culture, represents an association of TMPO/LAP2 variants with NAFLD and underscores the potential importance of the nuclear lamina in NAFLD.

Effect of calcium salts with eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  in the maternal and finishing diet on lamb  and adipose tissue during the lamb finishing period1.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) supplementation to ewes during late gestation on finishing lamb  and adipose tissue   (FA) profile and gene expression. Lambs born from ewes supplemented with Ca salts of EPA + DHA, or palm FA distillate (PFAD) high in palmitic and  at 0.39% DM during the last 50 d of gestation were used. Lambs were weaned at 61 d of age and adapted to a high concentrate diet for 1.5 mo. After adaptation, 74 lambs (28 pens) were blocked by sex and BW and used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments using the factors of dam supplementation (DS) and lamb supplementation (LS) of Ca salts of EPA + DHA or PFAD at 1.48% DM. Lambs were slaughtered after 42 d and  and adipose tissue collected for FA and gene expression analysis.  concentrations of EPA and DHA were greater (P < 0.01) with LS of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, a lamb × dam interaction was observed for EPA (P = 0.02) and DHA (P = 0.04); LS of EPA + DHA increased EPA and DHA, but the increase was greatest in lambs born from ewes supplemented with PFAD. No lamb × dam treatment interactions were observed for gene expression in  tissue (P > 0.10). Hepatic mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; P = 0.01) was greater in lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes vs. lambs from PFAD ewes. mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (P < 0.01),   synthase (P = 0.01), Δ5-desaturase (P < 0.01), and Δ6-desaturase (P < 0.01) were decreased in  of EPA + DHA lambs. A significant lamb × dam diet interaction was observed for elongation of very long chain   2 in adipose tissue (P = 0.01); lambs supplemented with the same FA as their dams had lower expression. Expression of HSL tended (P = 0.08) to be decreased in adipose of EPA + DHA lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes. The changes in mRNA expression suggest that lipogenesis decreased, and lipolysis increased in lamb  with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, changes suggest that lipogenesis decreased in lambs born from EPA + DHA supplemented dams and supplemented with EPA + DHA during the finishing period. In addition, these results suggest an interaction between supplementation of FA to dams during late gestation on lamb response of adipose tissue, but not , to FA supplementation during the finishing period.© The Author(s) 2019.

Gallstones can be pigmentary, cholesterol (75%) or mixed. Age, female sex, obesity, rapid weight loss, consumption of refined sugars, saturated fat, iron deficiency, vitamin D and low intake of fiber and vitamin C are factors associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis. On the other hand, the intake of ω-3  acids, , calcium, magnesium, fiber, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, nuts, coffee, moderate consumption of alcohol, vitamin C supplements, physical exercise and a regular diet have a protective paper. The most frequent kidney stones are calcium oxalate followed by mixed ones (oxalate and calcium phosphate), struvite, uric  and cystine. A high water intake is recommended (> 2.5 l / day), varying the type of recommended or unadvisable food depending on the type of calculus. In oxalic lithiasis it is recommended to reduce the consumption of meat, moderate that of spinach, Swiss chard, asparagus, chocolate and avoid excessive sodium intake. The administration of oxalate-degrading probiotics (Lactobacillus) may reduce intestinal absorption, although further studies are necessary to corroborate these results. In calcium phosphate acidifying diet is recommended and limit the consumption of coffee and tea. The prevention of uric calculus is based on hydration with alkalizing drinks and vegetarian diet, decreasing foods rich in purines (, kidney, fish eggs, anchovies, sardines and seafood) and in calculus of cystine diet is recommended alkalizing. Since the formation of struvite calculi is due to urinary infections, pharmacological treatment and the consumption of acidifying diets, moderation of the intake of phosphate-rich foods and limiting the contribution of fats and citrus fruits are necessary. The nutritional intervention is an effective measure in the prevention of biliary and renal lithiasis and prevent its recurrence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29296566>Effects of three different formulae of Gamisoyosan on lipid accumulation induced by  in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Gamisoyosan (GSS) is an herbal formula which has been used to treat women's diseases for several hundred years in Korea.

The present study compared the effects of GSS on  using three different formulae, Dongui-Bogam (KIOM A), Korean Pharmacopeia (KIOM B) and Korean National Health Insurance (KIOM C).In -induced HepG2  cells, cellular lipid accumulation, triglycerides and total cholesterol were measured after treatment with three GSS formulae and simvastatin as a positive control. To investigate the phytoestrogen activity of GSS, MCF-7 cells were treated with GSS, and hormone levels were quantified. Also, qualitative analysis was performed with UPLC.All types of GSS decreased cellular lipid accumulation. KIOM A was slightly less effective than the other two GSS formulae. KIOM B and KIOM C decreased cellular triglycerides more effective than simvastatin, but KIOM A did not affect cellular triglycerides. Cellular total cholesterol was decreased by all GSS and simvastatin. GSS showed phytoestrogen activity in MCF-7 cells. From the UPLC analysis data, geniposide, paeoniflorin and glycyrrhizin were detected form three GSS formulae.These results suggest that all GSS formulae have a beneficial effect on  disease during menopause and that differences of formula have no effect on the efficacy of the prescription.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29049355>Aberrant hepatic lipid storage and metabolism in canine portosystemic shunts.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a poorly understood multifactorial pandemic disorder. One of the hallmarks of NAFLD, hepatic steatosis, is a common feature in canine congenital portosystemic shunts. The aim of this study was to gain detailed insight into the pathogenesis of steatosis in this large animal model. Hepatic lipid accumulation, gene-expression analysis and HPLC-MS of neutral lipids and phospholipids in extrahepatic (EHPSS) and intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (IHPSS) was compared to healthy control dogs.  organoids of diseased dogs and healthy control dogs were incubated with palmitic- and , and lipid accumulation was quantified using LD540. In histological slides of shunt livers, a 12-fold increase of lipid content was detected compared to the control dogs (EHPSS P<0.01; IHPSS P = 0.042). Involvement of lipid-related genes to steatosis in portosystemic shunting was corroborated using gene-expression profiling. Lipid analysis demonstrated different triglyceride composition and a shift towards short chain and omega-3  acids in shunt versus healthy dogs, with no difference in lipid species composition between shunt types. All organoids showed a similar increase in triacylglycerols after free  acids enrichment. This study demonstrates that steatosis is probably secondary to canine portosystemic shunts.

Dihydrocurcumin (DHC) is one of the major metabolites of curcumin. So far, the pharmacological activity of DHC has not been reported. Here, we evaluate the effects of DHC on  (OA)-induced lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance and the underlying mechanism in L02 and HepG2 cells.OA-induced L02 and HepG2 cells were used as the in vitro model of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, glucose uptake and cell inflammation were evaluated by cellular biochemical assay, respectively. Signaling pathways involved in lipid metabolism including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα), the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1C (SREBP-1C) and patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3), glucose uptake including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphorylated serine-threonine protein kinase (pAKT), and oxidative stress including nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A) and 2E1 (CYP2E1) were investigated by western blotting and RT-qPCR, respectively.DHC decreased the levels of cellular triglycerides (TG) by regulating the mRNA and protein expression levels of SREBP-1C, PNPLA3 and PPARα. At the same time, DHC improved the hepatocellular glucose uptake by increasing the protein expression levels of pAKT and PI3K. Furthermore, DHC reduced the levels of cellular NO and ROS via Nrf2 signaling pathways.The present study firstly revealed that DHC ameliorated OA-induced steatosis through regulating the lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and insulin resistance in HepG2 and L02 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The literature suggests that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) may be a key player in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and it can modulate the synthesis of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Previous studies have shown that CYP1A1 is a key enzyme of oxidative stress, TNF-α is involved in the formation of insulin resistance (IR), oxidative stress and insulin resistance are the key factors for the formation of NAFLD. Therefore, it can be said that AHR may participate in contributing to NAFLD by regulating CYP1A1 and TNF-α. Alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF) is an effective AHR inhibitor. The present study was designed to explore the hepatoprotective effect of ANF in high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice and  (OA)-treated HepG2 hepatocytes. Mice were fed HFD to induce NAFLD, HepG2 cells were exposed to OA to induce hepatocyte injury, and ANF significantly reduced mouse and cellular  damage compared to the HFD-induced NAFLD and OA-treated HepG2 hepatocytes. ANF treatment reduces  damage by reducing ROS and IR, the data show that ANF inhibits the expression of AHR, CYP1A1 and TNF-α in NAFLD. Taken together, these findings show that ANF alleviate NAFLD via regulation of AHR/CYP1A1 and AHR/TNF-α pathways, which may have potential for further development as novel therapeutic agents for NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The dynamics of these organelles is controlled by a variety of regulatory surface proteins (RSPs). Assembly and export of VLDLs are mainly regulated by the microsomal transfer protein (MTP) and apoprotein B100. Formation and lipolysis of LDs are regulated by several RSPs. The best studied regulators belong to the PAT (Perilipin/Adipophilin/TIP47) and CIDE families. Knockdown or overexpression of SRPs may significantly affect the total number and size distribution of LDs. Intriguingly, a large cell-to-cell heterogeneity with respect to the number and size of LDs has been found in various cell types including hepatocytes. These findings suggest that the extent of cellular lipid accumulation is determined not only by the imbalance between lipid supply and utilization but also by variations in the expression of RSPs and metabolic enzymes. To better understand the relative regulatory impact of individual processes involved in the cellular TAG turnover, we developed a comprehensive kinetic model encompassing the pathways of the   and triglyceride metabolism and the main molecular processes governing the dynamics of LDs. The model was parametrized such that a large number of experimental in vitro and in vivo findings are correctly recapitulated. A control analysis of the model revealed that variations in the activity of FFA uptake, diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 2, and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) have the strongest influence on the cellular TAG level. We used the model to simulate LD size distributions in human hepatoma cells and hepatocytes exposed to a challenge with FFAs. A random fold change by a factor of about two in the activity of RSPs was sufficient to reproduce the large diversity of droplet size distributions observed in individual cells. Under the premise that the same extent of variability of RSPs holds for the intact organ, our model predicts variations in the TAG content of individual hepatocytes by a factor of about 3-6 depending on the nutritional regime. Taken together, our modeling approach integrates numerous experimental findings on individual processes in the cellular TAG metabolism and LD dynamics metabolism to a consistent state-of-the-art dynamic network model that can be used to study how changes in the external conditions or systemic parameters will affect the TAG content of hepatocytes.© 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29178411>Increased plasma oleoylethanolamide and palmitoleoylethanolamide levels correlate with inflammatory changes in alcohol binge drinkers: the case of HMGB1 in women.</a></h2><p>Alcohol binge drinking is a heavy pattern of alcohol consumption increasingly used by young people. In a previous study, we reported that young drinkers with a 2-year history of binge alcohol consumption had an overactivation of the innate immune system and peripheral inflammation when compared with controls. In the present study, we measured several biolipids that are   derivatives belonging to the acylethanolamide or 2-acylglycerol families in the plasma of the same subjects (n = 42; 20 men and 22 women). We found that during abstinence, alcohol binge drinkers had elevated plasma levels of oleoylethanolamide, palmitoleoylethanolamide, arachidonoylethanolamide, dihomo-γ-linolenoyl ethanolamide and linoleoyl ethanolamide, which positively correlated with changes in the mRNA expression of key inflammatory markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as toll-like receptors (TLR4), pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and cyclooxygenase-2. Additionally, plasma oleoylethanolamide positively correlated with plasma levels of high mobility group box-1, which is a danger-associated molecular pattern and an endogenous TLR4 agonist, specifically in female alcohol binge drinkers. No changes were observed in 2-acylglycerols in alcohol binge drinkers, although sex-related differences in these bioactive lipids as well as in palmitoleoylethanolamide and docosatetraenoylethanolamide levels were detected. These results extend the previous clinical findings observed in patients diagnosed with long-term alcohol use disorder to young users and suggest a prominent role for these lipids in the response to acute alcohol exposure.© 2017 Society for the Study of Addiction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30931080>Cherry Anthocyanins Regulate NAFLD by Promoting Autophagy Pathway.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic disease that threatens human health, and present therapies remain limited due to the lack of effective drugs. Lipid metabolic disturbance and oxidative stress have strong links to the development of NAFLD, while autophagy was generally accepted as a key regulatory mechanism on these steps. Our previous studies indicated that cherry anthocyanins (CACN) protected against high fat diet-induced obesity and NALFD in C57BL/6 mice, while the underlying molecule mechanism is still unclear. Thus, in this study, we show that CACN protect against - (OA-) induced oxidative stress and attenuate lipid droplet accumulation in NAFLD cell models. According to the results of a transmission electron microscope (TEM), western blot, immunofluorescence (IF), and adenovirus transfection (Ad-mCherry-GFP-LC3B), autophagy is in accordance with the lipid-lowering effect induced by CACN. Further studies illustrate that CACN may activate autophagy via mTOR pathways. In addition, an autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), was applied and the result suggested that autophagy indeed participates in the lipid clearance process in OA-induced lipid accumulation. All these results indicate that the positive effects of CACN on OA-induced hepatic lipid accumulation are mediated via activating autophagy, showing a potential target for the therapeutic strategy of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31283861>Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived lipopolysaccharide causes excessive hepatic lipid accumulation via activating NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Porphyromonas gingivalis is the main pathogen of periodontal disease affecting over half of the worldwide adult population. Recent studies have shown that P. gingivalis is related to the development of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), a global major chronic  disease, especially in developed countries. However, how P. gingivalis contributes to the pathogenesis of NAFLD has not been fully clarified. We aimed to conduct a preliminary exploration of the underlying mechanism of P. gingivalis infection in the development of NAFLD.Human hepatocellular cells HepG2 were incubated with/without  (OA) and tested for lipid accumulation upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from P. gingivalis or Escherichia coli. Intracellular lipid droplet formation was analyzed and quantified by Oil Red O staining. The involvement of signaling pathway molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines related to NF-κB and MAPKs were examined with Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses and further evaluated with inhibitor treatment and RNA interference.HepG2 cells accumulated more intracellular lipids when stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS, as compared to cells treated with E. coli LPS or control. Further pathway analysis demonstrated that after stimulation with P. gingivalis LPS, cells displayed significantly upregulated MyD88 expression, increased phosphorylation of p65 and JNK, and more release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-8, and TNF-α. In addition, suppression of phosphorylation of p65 and JNK by inhibitors and RNA interference resulted in a reduction in lipid accumulation upon P. gingivalis LPS treatment.These results suggest that P. gingivalis-derived LPS may contribute to intracellular lipid accumulation and inflammatory reaction of HepG2 cells via the activation of NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways. This study offers a possible explanation to the functional involvement of P. gingivalis infection in the pathological progression of NAFLD. These findings may help design new treatment strategies in NAFLD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Moreover, information regarding the effects of unsaturated  acids on circadian parameters is scarce. We aimed at studying the effects of low doses of saturated as well as unsaturated  acids on circadian metabolism in vivo and at deciphering the mechanism by which  acids convey their effect. Mice were fed non-obesogenic doses of palm or olive oil and hepatocytes were treated with palmitate and oleate. Mice fed non-obesogenic doses of palm oil showed increased signaling towards   synthesis, while olive oil increased signaling towards   oxidation. Low doses of palmitate and oleate were sufficient to alter circadian rhythms, due to changes in the expression and/or activity of key metabolic proteins. Palmitate, but not oleate, counteracted the reduction in lipid accumulation and BMAL1-induced expression of mitochondrial genes involved in   oxidation. Palmitate was also found to interfere with the transcriptional activity of CLOCK:BMAL1 by preventing BMAL1 deacetylation and activation. In addition, palmitate, but not oleate, reduced PER2-mediated transcriptional activation and increased REV-ERBα-mediated transcriptional inhibition of Bmal1. The inhibition of PER2-mediated transcriptional activation by palmitate was achieved by interfering with PER2 nuclear translocation. Indeed, PER2 reduced fat accumulation in hepatocytes and this reduction was prevented by palmitate. Herein, we show that the detrimental metabolic alteration seen with high doses of palmitate manifests itself early on even with non-obesogenic levels. This is achieved by modulating BMAL1 at several levels abrogating its activity and expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29128353>Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mediates lipogenesis and contributes to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive disease and poses a high risk of severe  damage. However, the pathogenesis of NASH is still unclear. Accumulation of lipid droplets and insulin resistance is the hallmark of NASH. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4) plays key role in glucose metabolism via regulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Here, we demonstrated a novel of PDK4 in NASH by regulating hepatic steatosis and insulin signaling pathway in methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NASH model. Hepatic PDK4 levels were highly induced in human patients with NASH and MCD diet fed mice, as well as in hepatocytes treated with . The glucose and lipid metabolism were impaired in Pdk4 mice. Pdk4 deficiency ameliorated the hepatic steatosis significantly in NASH mice. Pdk4-MCD mice had reduced  weights and triglyceride (TG) levels. And Pdk4 deficiency dramatically reduced the expression of genes related to   uptake, synthesis and gluconeogenesis. In addition, elevated phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), p-SAPK/JNK and diminished p-ERK, p-P38, p-Akt and p-mTOR/p-4EBP1 proteins were observed. In conclusion, our data indicated that PDK4 potentially contributes to the hepatic steatosis in NASH via regulating several signaling pathway and PDK4 may be a new therapeutic strategy against NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was to investigate the effect of Asiatic  from Potentilla chinensis (AAPC) on  cell lipid metabolism, exploring the underlying mechanism of AAPC against NAFLD. In vivo, the animal NAFLD model was induced by feeding rats with high fat diet (HFD) for 18 weeks, and meanwhile the rats were treated with AAPC from weeks 8 to 18; In vitro experiment, the effect of AAPC on dyslipidemia induced by  (OA) in hepatic cells (HepG2) was evaluated. The results showed that AAPC significantly decreased lipidosis in rats and in HepG2 cells; it notably alleviated hepatocyte damage and lipid disturbance in rats. Moreover, the cell experiments showed that AAPC strongly inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation. It markedly decreased hepatocyte lipogenesis by regulating the key lipid metabolism-related factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), encoding carboxylase,  X Receptor Rα (LXRα),   synthase (FAS), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The further study elucidated that AAPC treatment significantly alleviated inflammatory response by inhibiting the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway. Moreover, AAPC significantly alleviated hepatocyte apoptosis and lipid metabolism disorder through reducing the extent of ERS. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that AAPC significantly ameliorates NAFLD by inhibiting the ERS pathway and lipid deposition, which may be a potential natural medicine for the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These risk factors include but are not limited to obesity, non-alcoholic  (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Since the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome has multiple metabolic origins, there is no single treatment for it. Pharmacological approaches consist of separate drugs which target at individual risk factors which pose various side effects. Functional foods or nutraceuticals which have potentially important anti-obesity properties have thus attracted great attention. Schisandrae Fructus is a Chinese herb traditionally used as a  tonic. Silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle (Silybum marianum), is a dietary supplement that is widely used in western society for the prevention and treatment of  problems. Crataegus Fructus (hawthorn) is traditionally used to promote digestion and dissipate food stagnation. Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is traditionally used for treatment of diabetes in Ayurvedic Medicine.We aimed to develop a multi-targeted herbal formula to target on the multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome using individual herbs. This proposed herbal formula include sylimarin and Schisandrae Fructus, for NAFLD; Crataegus Fructus for obesity and hyperlipidemia; and Momordica charantia for hyperglycemia.For in vitro study, we carried out insulin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation and fluorescent tagged cholesterol-treated Caco-2 cell assay to study for adipogenesis and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells, respectively. -induced HepG2 cell assay was used to study for -induced , and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) assay was used to study for glucose uptake from the gut. For in vivo study, we performed an 8-week and a 12-week treatment studies, with each study comprising of 4 groups of C57Bl/6 male mice given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii)-(iv) High-fat diet (contains 21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol). After the initial 8 weeks of normal chow or high-fat diet feeding to induce obesity, animals were given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii) High-fat diet; (iii) High-fat diet + 2% herbal formula; or (iv) High-fat diet + 4% herbal formula as treatment for another 8 weeks or 12 weeks.Our in vitro results suggested Crataegus Fructus aqueous extract exerted potent inhibitory effects on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells. Schisandrae Fructus aqueous extract and milk thistle exerted inhibitory effects on -induced  in HepG2 cells. Momordica charantia extract on the other hand, exerted significant inhibitory effect on glucose uptake into BBMV. Our in vivo results showed that our herbal formula exhibited a trend to reduce diet-induced increase in body weight and fat pad mass (epididymal, perirenal and inguinal fat); and significantly reduced diet-induced increase in  weight,  lipid, and plasma lipid dose-dependently. Besides, high-fat diet induced a significant reduction in adiponectin level which was significantly improved by herbal formula supplementation at 4%. There was however no significant effect of the herbal formula on diet-induced increase in plasma glucose or insulin levels at either dose. Herbal formula also significantly reduced diet-induced inflammation in the  at both doses.Taken together, these data suggested the potential of our novel multi-targeted herbal formula to be used as a therapeutic agent for diet-induced metabolic syndrome, with special emphasis on NAFLD.Copyright © 2018.

However, whether celecoxib is effective in alleviating steatosis during hepatocarcinogenesis is unknown. In a rapid hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model established via hydrodynamic transfection of activated forms of AKT and c-Met proto-oncogenes, we investigated the antisteatotic and anticarcinogenic efficacy of celecoxib in vivo. Multiple HCC cell lines were employed for in vitro evaluation. Additionally, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, hematoxylin and eosin staining and Oil Red O staining were applied for mechanistic investigation. The results revealed that if celecoxib was administered in the early stage of AKT/c-Met-induced HCC, it resulted in disease stabilization. Moreover, celecoxib could alleviate lipid accumulation in the HCC mice and in an -induced in vitro hepatic steatosis model. Further evidence at the molecular level indicated that celecoxib down-regulated the expression of phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the HCC mice. In addition, celecoxib efficiently repressed the phosphor-Akt (Thr308)/  synthase (FASN) axis both in vivo and in vitro. Altogether, this study suggests that celecoxib exerts its antilipogenic efficacy by targeting a COX-2/AKT/FASN cascade, which contributes to its ability to delay hepatocarcinogenesis.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905315>Adipocytes as lipid sensors of  transport through a functional Caco-2/HT29-MTX intestinal barrier.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue function in the regulation of lipemia is highly dependent on intestinal absorption of nutrients. Therefore the aim of the present study was the development and validation of an in vitro multiculture model allowing to measure intestinal absorption using adipocytes as lipid sensors. We previously described (1) novel methods to study  induction of adipogenesis and lipogenesis and (2) a functional reconstituted intestinal barrier using human cell lines Caco-2/HT29-MTX (9:1). In the present study we develop a co-culture model with either adipocytes or hepatocytes as sensors for intestinal lipid absorption. This model was validated using  (OA) pre-absorbed onto the intestinal barrier. Optimized experimental conditions were obtained with partially differentiated 3T3L1-MBX adipocytes sensing up to 5 μM OA in solution or 40 μM OA pre-absorbed by Caco2/HT29-MTX intestinal barriers. Metabolism including glycemia and insulinemia greatly influenced the ability to  TG accumulation in adipocytes. By comparison AML12 hepatocytes found less sensitive to OA (up to 1 μM). The present study demonstrates a much better functionality for   uptake and release in Caco2/HT29-MTX versus Caco-2 intestinal barriers. Taken together these results open new opportunities to study in vitro lipid transfer between intestinal barriers and either adipocytes or hepatocytes.

Although its toxicity has been thoroughly studied at high concentrations, there is still insufficient knowledge on possible alterations of cell function at subtoxic concentrations, which are in fact more representative concentrations of intoxication scenarios. In this study, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics approach was used to investigate the metabolic changes in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) exposed to two subtoxic concentrations of MDMA (LC and LC) for 24 h. Metabolomic profiling of both intracellular metabolites and volatile metabolites in the extracellular medium of PMH was performed. Multivariate analysis showed that the metabolic pattern of cells exposed to MDMA discriminates from the controls in a concentration-dependent manner. Exposure to LC MDMA induces a significant increase in some intracellular metabolites, including  and palmitic , and a decrease in glutamate, aspartate, 5-oxoproline, fumarate, malate, phosphoric , α-ketoglutarate and citrate. Extracellular metabolites such as acetophenone, formaldehyde, pivalic , glyoxal and 2-butanone were found significantly increased after exposure to MDMA, compared to controls, whereas 4-methylheptane, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, nonanal, among others, were found significantly decreased. The panel of discriminatory metabolites is mainly involved in tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle,   metabolism, glutamate metabolism, antioxidant defenses and possibly changes in the  enzyme machinery. Overall, these results highlight the potential of the intra- and extracellular metabolome to study alterations triggered by subtoxic concentrations of MDMA in hepatic cell functions, which represents a more realistic appraisal of early toxicity events posed by exposure to this drug.

SD rats were fed with high fat diet (HFD) to induce NASH. From the 16th w, the HFD was full or half replaced by olive oil to observe the protective effects.In vitro, OA substantially alleviated PA induced cellular apoptosis, oxidative stress, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as inflammation in hepatocytes. In vivo, only olive oil supplementation had no detrimental effects, while HFD developed NASH in normal rats. Full replacement of HFD with olive oil had profoundly reversed NASH. Noteworthily, half replacement of HFD with olive oil (a mixed diet) has ameliorated NASH injury as well. It strikingly changed the hepatic histology from macrovesicular-steatosis into entire microvesicular-steatosis, and significantly reduced inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis.Our study has demonstrated in both hepatocytes and NASH rats that  acids had great potential to combat the saturated  acids induced hepatic lipotoxicity. Only half replacement of HFD by monounsaturated  acids rich diet still had significant therapeutic outcome in NASH rats. Redirecting the toxic saturated  acids into triglyceride storage and reduction of cholesterol accumulation might be the possible explanation of OA driven protection in this scenario.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The L-FABP T94A variant, originating from one of the most common polymorphisms in the FABP family, is associated with several lipid-related disorders. However, the molecular factors that determine the observed functional differences are currently unknown. In our work, we performed a high resolution comparative molecular analysis of L-FABP T94T and L-FABP T94A in their unbound states and in the presence of representative ligands of the   and bile  classes. We collected residue-resolved NMR spectral fingerprints of the two variants, and compared secondary structures, backbone dynamics, side chain arrangements, binding site occupation, and intermolecular contacts. We found that threonine to alanine replacement did not result in strongly perturbed structural and dynamic features, although differences in  binding by the two variants were detected. Based on chemical shift perturbations at sites distant from position 94 and on differences in intermolecular contacts, we suggest that long-range communication networks in L-FABP propagate the effect of amino  substitution at sites relevant for ligand binding or biomolecular recognition.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The present study investigated the influence of farm location (three farms containing different vegetation types) and sex on the sensory quality of springbok longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle. The sensory profile (aroma, flavour and texture) was determined by descriptive sensory analysis, in addition to determination of the physical meat quality, proximate and   composition.Farm location had a significant influence on the sensory quality (gamey and -like aroma; beef, -like, lamb-like and herbaceous flavour; sweet taste; tenderness; residue; mealiness; Warner-Bratzler shear force; moisture, protein and intramuscular lipid content) and   content (; α-linolenic ; total saturated and monounsaturated  acids; polyunsaturated to saturated   ratio; total omega-3 polyunsaturated  ; and omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated   ratio) of springbok meat. Sex influenced the chemical composition of springbok meat; however, the influence on the sensory profile was minor (sweet taste; P < 0.001).Farm location could influence the sensory quality and composition of springbok meat and should be considered when harvesting for meat production.

This study aims to identify factors affecting synthesis and secretion of VLDL-TAG using the growth hormone-deficient Ames dwarf mouse model, which has reduced serum TAG. Proteomic analysis coupled with a bioinformatics-driven approach revealed that these mice express greater amounts of hepatic cathepsin B and lower amounts of   -binding protein (LFABP) than their wildtype littermates. siRNA-mediated knockdown of cathepsin B in McA-RH7777 cells resulted in a 39% increase in [H]TAG associated with VLDL secretion. Cathepsin B knockdown was accompanied by a 74% increase in cellular LFABP protein levels, but only when cells were exposed to 0.4 mm  (OA) complexed to BSA. The cathepsin B knockdown and 24-h treatment with OA resulted in increased CD36 expression alone and additively. Co-localization of LFABP and cathepsin B was observed in a distinct Golgi apparatus-like pattern, which required a 1-h OA treatment. Moreover, we observed co-localization of LFABP and apoB, independent of the OA treatment. Overexpression of cathepsin B resulted in decreased OA uptake and VLDL secretion. Co-expression of cathepsin B and cathepsin B-resistant mutant LFABP in McA-RH7777 cells resulted in an increased TAG secretion as compared with cells co-expressing cathepsin B and wildtype LFABP. Together, these data indicate that cathepsin B regulates VLDL secretion and free   uptake via cleavage of LFABP, which occurs in response to  exposure.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29469041>Natural Extracts Abolished Lipid Accumulation in Cells Harbouring non-favourable PNPLA3 genotype.</a></h2><p>Background &amp; aims.

The early phase of sepsis is characterized by a massive formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species such as superoxide and nitric oxide. However, few comprehensive studies on plasma antioxidants have been reported. Increased oxidative stress was confirmed in sepsis patients ( = 18) at the time of hospitalization by a significant decrease in plasma ascorbic  and a significant increase in the percentage of oxidized form of coenzyme Q10 in total coenzyme Q10 compared to age-matched healthy controls ( = 62). Tissue oxidative damage in patients was suggested by a significant decrease in polyunsaturated   contents and a significant increase in  contents in total free  acids. Thus, it is reasonable that plasma uric  (end product of purines) would be significantly elevated. However, uric  levels were continuously decreased during hospitalization for 7 days, indicating a continuous formation of peroxynitrite. A greater decrease in free cholesterol (FC) compared to cholesterol esters (CE) was observed. Thus, the FC/CE ratio significantly increased, suggesting deficiency of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase secreted from the . Plasma levels of prosaposin, a coenzyme Q10 binding protein, significantly decreased as compared to healthy controls.

We developed a novel ASBT inhibitor, an N-(3,4-o-dichlorophenyl)-2-(3-trifluoromethoxy) benzamide derivative referred to as IMB17-15, and investigated its therapeutic effects and the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects. Syrian golden hamsters were challenged with high-fat diet (HFD) to induce NAFLD and were subsequently administered 400 mg/kg IMB17-15 by gavage daily for 21 days. Serum, , and fecal samples were collected for further analysis. Plasma concentration-time profiles of IMB17-15 were also constructed. The human hepatocyte cell line HL-7702 was treated with  (OA) with or without IMB17-15. Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to study the molecular mechanisms of IMB17-15. We found that IMB17-15 inhibited ASBT and subsequently suppressed ileal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and FXR-activated fibroblast growth factor15/19 (FGF15/19) expression, which reduced the hepatic phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) levels and upregulated the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) activity. Additionally, IMB17-15 stimulated adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPKα) phosphorylation and enhanced peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) expression and thus promoted triglyceride (TG) oxidation and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) metabolism through an ASBT-independent mechanism. In conclusion, a novel ASBT inhibitor known as IMB17-15 protected hamsters against HFD-induced NFALD by manipulating BA and lipid homeostasis. IMB17-15 also reduced lipid deposition in human hepatic cell lines, indicating that it may be useful as a therapy for NAFLD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547786>Genomics of lipid-laden human hepatocyte cultures enables drug target screening for the treatment of non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a major health burden in need for new medication. To identify potential drug targets a genomic study was performed in lipid-laden primary human hepatocyte (PHH) and human hepatoma cell cultures.PHH, HuH7 and HepG2 hepatoma cell cultures were treated with lipids and/or TNFα. Intracellular lipid load was quantified with the ORO assay. The Affymetrix HG-U133+ array system was employed to perform transcriptome analysis. The lipid droplet (LD) growth and fusion was determined by fluorescence microscopy. LD associated proteins were imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and confirmed by Western immunoblotting. Bioinformatics defined perturbed metabolic pathways.Whole genome expression profiling identified 227, 1031 and 571 significant regulated genes. Likewise, the combined lipid and TNFα treatment of PHH, HuH7 and HepG2 cell cultures revealed 154, 1238 and 278 differentially expressed genes. Although genomic responses differed among in-vitro systems, commonalities were ascertained by filtering the data for LD associated gene regulations. Among others the LD-growth and fusion associated cell death inducing DFFA like effector C (CIDEC), perilipins (PLIN2, PLIN3), the synaptosome-associated-protein 23 and the vesicle associated membrane protein 3 were strongly up-regulated. Likewise, the PPAR targets pyruvate-dehydrogenase-kinase-4 and angiopoietin-like-4 were up-regulated as was hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (HILPDA), flotilin and FGF21. Their inhibition ameliorates triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation. TNFα treatment elicited strong induction of the chemokine CXCL8, the kinases MAP3K8, MAP4K4 and negative regulators of cytokine signaling, i.e. SOCS2&SOCS3. Live cell imaging of DsRED calreticulin plasmid transfected HuH7 cells permitted an assessment of LD growth and fusion and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy evidenced induced LD-associated PLIN2, CIDEC, HIF1α, HILPDA, JAK1, PDK4 and ROCK2 expression. Notwithstanding, CPT1A protein was repressed to protect mitochondria from lipid overload. Pharmacological inhibition of the GTPase-dynamin and the   transporter-2 reduced lipid uptake by 28.5 and 35%, respectively. Finally, a comparisons of in-vitro/NAFLD patient biopsy findings confirmed common gene regulations thus demonstrating clinical relevance.The genomics of fat-laden hepatocytes revealed LD-associated gene regulations and perturbed metabolic pathways.

There are, however, few ideal medications for NAFLD, which work by targeting acylcarnitine metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of theacrine, a rare purine alkaloid isolated from Camellia assamica var. kucha, against acylcarnitine metabolism disorder in NAFLD.The pharmacological activities of theacrine were studied using high-fat diet (HFD)-fed ApoE-/- and C57BL/6J mice models. Oleate-treated HepG2 and L-02 cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanism of theacrine on acylcarnitine metabolism. The target of theacrine was confirmed in vitro as the blockade of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and protein kinase A.Theacrine inhibits hepatic steatosis and  inflammation and improves energy expenditure in HFD-fed mice. Theacrine ameliorates acylcarnitine metabolism disorder in HFD-fed mice and oleate-treated hepatocytes by improving   oxidation. The underlying mechanism involves theacrine's activation of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 and consequently, the increased activity of long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD) through deacetylation.Theacrine promotes acylcarnitine metabolism in NAFLD through the SIRT3/LCAD signaling pathway.

The object of the study was to examine the changes in the fat contents, the   composition and the iron content in livers of animals, which have died from hepatic lipidosis.The conspicuous livers (n = 85) were collected from 20 flocks where the phenomenon of massive increased animal losses accompanied by marked macroscopically visible pathological  steatosis suddenly occurred. For comparison and as a reference, livers (n = 16) of two healthy flocks were taken. Healthy and diseased flocks were fed identical diets concerning official nutrient recommendations and were operating under standardized, comparable conventional conditions.Compared to livers of healthy animals, in the livers of turkeys died from hepatic lipidosis there were found massively increased fat levels (130 ± 33.2 vs. 324 ± 101 g/kg dry matter-DM).

Rutin is a natural flavonoid with significant roles in combating cellular oxidative stress and regulating lipid metabolism. The current study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying rutin's hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects in nonalcoholic  disease. Rutin treatment was applied to male C57BL/6 mice maintained on a high-fat diet and HepG2 cells challenged with . Hepatic lipid accumulation was evaluated by triglyceride assay and Oil Red O staining. Oxidative hepatic injury was assessed by malondialdehyde assay, superoxide dismutase assay and reactive oxygen species assay. The expression levels of various lipogenic and lipolytic genes were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions. In addition,  autophagy was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In both fat-challenged murine  tissues and HepG2 cells, rutin treatment was shown to significantly lower triglyceride content and the abundance of lipid droplets. Rutin was also found to reduce cellular malondialdehyde level and restore superoxide dismutase activity in hepatocytes. Among the various lipid-related genes, rutin treatment was able to restore the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) and its downstream targets, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and 2 (CPT-1 and CPT-2), while suppressing those of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), diglyceride acyltransfase 1 and 2 (DGAT-1 and 2), as well as acyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In addition, rutin was shown to repress the autophagic function of  tissues by down-regulating key autophagy biomarkers, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β). The experimental data demonstrated that rutin could reduce triglyceride content and mitigate oxidative injuries in fat-enriched hepatocytes. The hypolipidemic properties of rutin could be attributed to its ability to simultaneously facilitate   metabolism and inhibit lipogenesis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Three experimental diets differing basically in DHA:EPA ratio, that is, 0·68 (diet D:E-0·68), 1·09 (D:E-1·09) and 2·05 (D:E-2·05), were randomly assigned to nine tanks of 3-year-old tongue sole (ten females and fifteen males in each tank). The feeding trail lasted for 90 d before and during the spawning season. Fish were reared in a flowing seawater system and fed to apparent satiation twice daily. Compared with diet D:E-0·68, diet D:E-1·09 significantly enhanced the oestradiol production in females, whereas diet D:E-2·05 significantly enhanced the testosterone production in males. In ovaries, diet D:E-1·09 induced highest mRNA expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, 17α-hydroxylase (P450c17) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). In testes, diet 2·05 resulted in highest mRNA expression of FSHR, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450c17 and 3β-HSD.   profiles in fish tissues reflected closely those of diets. Female fish had more gonadal EPA content but less DHA content than male fish, whereas there was a reverse observation in . In conclusion, the dietary DHA:EPA ratio, possibly combined with the dietary EPA:arachidonic  ratio, differentially regulated sex steroid hormone synthesis in mature female and male tongue soles. Females seemed to require more EPA but less DHA for the gonadal steroidogenesis than males. The results are beneficial to sex-specific nutritive strategies in domestic teleost.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30538802>Omega-9 , the Main Compound of Olive Oil, Mitigates Inflammation during Experimental Sepsis.</a></h2><p>The Mediterranean diet, rich in olive oil, is beneficial, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Olive oil is mostly composed of the monounsaturated   omega-9. We showed omega-9 protects septic mice modulating lipid metabolism. Sepsis is initiated by the host response to infection with organ damage, increased plasma free  acids, high levels of cortisol, massive cytokine production, leukocyte activation, and endothelial dysfunction. We aimed to analyze the effect of omega-9 supplementation on corticosteroid unbalance, inflammation, bacterial elimination, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma expression, an omega-9 receptor and inflammatory modulator. We treated mice for 14 days with omega-9 and induced sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We measured systemic corticosterone levels, cytokine production, leukocyte and bacterial counts in the peritoneum, and the expression of PPAR gamma in both  and adipose tissues during experimental sepsis. We further studied omega-9 effects on leukocyte rolling in mouse cremaster muscle-inflamed postcapillary venules and in the cerebral microcirculation of septic mice. Here, we demonstrate that omega-9 treatment is associated with increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and decreased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1 in peritoneal lavage fluid of mice with sepsis. Omega-9 treatment also decreased systemic corticosterone levels. Neutrophil migration from circulation to the peritoneal cavity and leukocyte rolling on the endothelium were decreased by omega-9 treatment. Omega-9 also decreased bacterial load in the peritoneal lavage and restored  and adipose tissue PPAR gamma expression in septic animals. Our data suggest a beneficial anti-inflammatory role of omega-9 in sepsis, mitigating leukocyte rolling and leukocyte influx, balancing cytokine production, and controlling bacterial growth possibly through a PPAR gamma expression-dependent mechanism. The significant reduction of inflammation detected after omega-9 enteral injection can further contribute to the already known beneficial properties facilitated by unsaturated  -enriched diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455870>Specific diacylglycerols generated by hepatic lipogenesis stimulate the oncogenic androgen receptor activity in male hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Obesity-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is more prevalent in males than in females, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The influence of hepatic androgen receptor (AR) pathway on the gender difference of HCC has been well documented. Here we investigated the role of hepatic lipogenesis, which is elevated in the livers of obese and nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) patients, in stimulating the AR pathway for the male preference of obesity induced HCC.Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a fructose-rich high carbohydrate diet (HCD) to induce hepatic lipogenesis. The effect of hepatic lipogenesis on AR was examined by the expression of hydrodynamically injected AR reporter and the endogenous AR target gene; the mechanism was delineated in hepatoma cell lines and validated in male mice.The hepatic lipogenesis induced by a fructose-rich HCD enhanced the transcriptional activity of hepatic AR in male mice, which did not happen when fed a high fat diet. This AR activation was blocked by sh-RNAs or inhibitors targeting key enzymes in lipogenesis, either acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunit alpha (ACCα), or   synthase (FASN), in vivo and in vitro. Further mechanistic study identified that specific unsaturated  , the  (C18:1 n-9), incorporated DAGs produced by hepatic lipogenesis are the key molecules to enhance the AR activity, through activation of Akt kinase, and this novel mechanism is targeted by metformin.Our study elucidates a novel mechanism underlying the higher risk of HCC in obese/NAFLD males, through specific DAGs enriched by hepatic lipogenesis to increase the transcriptional activity of hepatic AR, a confirmed risk factor for male HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30603757>Gene expression profile-based drug screen identifies SAHA as a novel treatment for NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic  disease worldwide. Being part of the metabolic syndrome, NAFLD is characterized by the deposition of triglycerides (TGs) as lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of hepatic cells. Recently, the rapid development of high-throughput genome analysis technologies provided opportunities to screen for new drugs for NAFLD. In this study, we screened for potential drugs based on the gene expression profiles of 73 compounds and identified histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as a novel treatment for the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes. In the subsequent analysis and experiments, we discovered that SAHA inhibited the   and lipid metabolism pathways in hepatic cells and induced a significant deficiency of lipid accumulation in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells. Furthermore, SAHA inhibited lipid synthesis in hepatic cells by directly suppressing the expression of DGAT2. Hence, our study provides a novel method to screen for effective drugs for  diseases and identifies SAHA as a potent treatment for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30380656>Advanced  Fibrosis Is Independently Associated with Palmitic  and Insulin Levels in Patients with Non-Alcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Changes in lipid metabolism occur during the development and progression non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). However, the   (FA) profile in red blood cells (RBC) from patients with  fibrosis remains unexplored. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the   profile in RBC, dietary lipid intake and insulin resistance indicators in patients with NAFLD, according to the degree of hepatic fibrosis. Using elastography, patients were classified with ( = 52) and without ( = 37) advanced  fibrosis. The   profile in RBC was analyzed using gas chromatography and the lipid intake was evaluated through a 24-h dietary recall.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 and its analog exendin-4 can ameliorate certain aspects of this syndrome by inducing weight loss and reducing hepatic triglyceride accumulation, but it is unclear whether these effects result from the effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 on the pancreas, or from direct action on the . This study investigated the direct action and putative cellular mechanism of exendin-4 on steatotic hepatocytes in culture. Steatosis was induced in cultured HepG2 human hepatoma cells by incubation in media supplemented with 2 mM each of linoleic  and . Steatotic hepatocytes were then pre-incubated in the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 for 30 min, then treated with exendin-4 over a period of 24 h. Cell viability and triglyceride content were characterized by a TUNEL assay and AdipoRed staining, respectively. Our results showed that steatotic cells maintained high levels of intracellular triglycerides (80%) compared to lean controls (25%). Exendin-4 treatment caused a significant reduction in intracellular triglyceride content after 12 h that persisted through 24 h, while protein kinase A inhibitors abolished the effects of exendin-4. The results demonstrate the exendin-4 induces a partial reduction in triglycerides in steatotic hepatocytes within 12 h via the GLP-1 receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase A. Thus, the reduction in hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation is likely driven primarily by downregulation of lipogenesis and upregulation of β-oxidation of free  acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30188729>Polyurethane Nanoparticle-Loaded Fenofibrate Exerts Inhibitory Effects on Nonalcoholic  Disease in Mice.</a></h2><p>Polyurethane (PU) nanoparticles are potential drug carriers. We aimed to study the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of biodegradable PU nanoparticles loaded with fenofibrate (FNB-PU) on nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). FNB-PU was prepared by a green process, and its preventive effects on NAFLD were investigated on HepG2 cells and mice. FNB-PU showed sustained in vitro FNB release profile. Compared to FNB crude drug, FNB-PU significantly decreased triglyceride content in HepG2 cells incubated with  and in livers of mice with NAFLD induced by a methionine choline deficient diet, and increased plasma FNB concentration of the mice.

In this study, we investigated the anti-hepatosteatosis effects of fermented  extract (CME) in AML-12 hepatocytes. Although the levels of adenosine and cordycepin were reduced in the extracts of CM grown on germinated soybean (GSCE) and fermented CM grown on germinated soybean (GSC) by  ON188 (ON188E), the expression of   oxidation (FAO) genes were upregulated only by GSC-ON188E treatment in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, a lipogenic gene, stearoyl Coenzyme A desaturase 1, was downregulated by ON188E.

When cells were treated with ON188E, sphingosine kinase 2 mainly responsible for hepatic sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) synthesis was upregulated and S1P was elevated.

This condition is associated with dyslipidemia and predisposition to cardiovascular diseases. Circulating levels of triglycerides (TG) and free  acids (FFA) have not yet been consistently defined in severe arthritis. Similarly, the metabolism of these lipids in the arthritic  has not yet been clarified. Aiming at filling these gaps this study presents a characterization of the circulating lipid profile and of the  acids uptake and metabolism in perfused livers of rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis. The levels of TG and total cholesterol were reduced in both serum (10-20%) and  (20-35%) of arthritic rats. The levels of circulating FFA were 40% higher in arthritic rats, possibly in consequence of cytokine-induced adipose tissue lipolysis. Hepatic uptake and oxidation of palmitic and  acids was higher in arthritic livers. The phenomenon results possibly from a more oxidized state of the arthritic . Indeed, NADPH/NADP and NADH/NAD ratios were 30% lower in arthritic livers, which additionally presented higher activities of the citric  cycle driven by both endogenous and exogenous FFA. The lower levels of circulating and hepatic TG possibly are caused by an increased oxidation associated to a reduced synthesis of  acids in arthritic livers. These results reveal that the lipid hepatic metabolism in arthritic rats presents a strong catabolic tendency, a condition that should contribute to the marked cachexia described for arthritic rats and possibly for the severe rheumatoid arthritis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Saturated Fat in Wistar Rats.</a></h2><p>Dyslipidemia is caused by disturbances in lipid metabolism that lead to chronic elevations of serum lipids, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides, increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, atherogenic processes, and cardiovascular diseases. The oil from the fruits of Euterpe oleracea (OFEO) is rich in unsaturated  acids with potential for treating alterations in lipid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of OFEO on hyperlipidemia induced by Cocos nucifera L. saturated fat (GSC) in Wistar rats. Chromatographic profile showed that unsaturated  acids account for 66.08% in OFEO, predominately  (54.30%), and saturated  acids (palmitic  31.6%) account for 33.92%. GSC-induced dyslipidemia resulted in an increase in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and  and abdominal fat, as well as atherogenic processes in the thoracic aorta. OFEO treatment did not reduce hypertriglyceridemia, but did reduce total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, thus contributing to the antiatherogenic action of OFEO. OFEO treatment inhibited the formation of atheromatous plaques in the vascular endothelium of the treated rats, as well as those who were treated with simvastatin.

We therefore hypothesized that the appetite-regulating effects of FAs are perturbed in obesity. Ten men with severe obesity [median body mass index (BMI) of 51.0 kg/m (range of 47.9-69.0)] and 10 men without obesity [BMI of 24.6 kg/m (range of 21.7-26.8)] were recruited for a double-blind randomized crossover study. On two occasions, participants were given isocaloric (2,660 kJ) and isovolemic (80 ml) loads of either  (long-chain FA) or olive oil (TG) containing radiolabeled lipid and water markers. Postload scintigraphy, blood sampling, and assessment of appetite were performed for 10 h, after which an ad libitum meal was served. Compared with olive oil,  slowed gastric mean emptying time (GMET) for lipids ( P < 0.001), accelerated orocoecal transit time (OCTT; P = 0.005), increased postload cholecystokinin section ( P < 0.001), and suppressed ad libitum energy intake ( P = 0.028) in men with severe obesity, and similar effects were seen in the nonobese group (no group × lipid interactions). However, independent of lipid loads, GMET and OCTT were slower (GMET P = 0.046; GMET P = 0.003; OCTT P = 0.001), and basal and postload secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) was attenuated ( P = 0.045 and P = 0.048, respectively) in men with severe obesity compared with men without obesity. We conclude that the more potent appetite-regulating effects of  versus olive oil are unimpaired in men with severe obesity. However, regardless of lipid formulations, severe obesity is associated with slowed gastrointestinal transit and attenuated GLP-1 secretion. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Orally ingested  acids more efficiently reduce appetite and energy intake than triglycerides also in men with severe obesity. Men with severe obesity have delayed gastrointestinal transit and attenuated early gut hormone responses after an oral lipid load compared with men without obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569635> Wolf Extract Ameliorates Hepatic Steatosis through Regulation of Lipid Metabolism, Inhibition of ER Stress, and Activation of Autophagy via AMPK Activation.</a></h2><p> Wolf (PCW) is an edible, pharmaceutical mushroom with remarkable biological properties including anti-tumor, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-ageing, and anti-diabetic effects. In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free   (FFA)-palmitic and -and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice  were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with lipogenesis,   oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with   oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of lipid metabolism, inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30460699>Unsaturated  Acids Increase the Expression of Hepassocin through a Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3-Dependent Pathway in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Hepassocin (HPS) is a hepatokine that regulates hepatocyte proliferation. It is known that HPS plays an important role in the development of nonalcoholic  diseases (NAFLD).  acids, such as  (OLA), exhibit the ability to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), and the binding site of STAT3 is found in the promoter region of HPS. However, the regulation of HPS by  acids is still obscure. To clarify the regulation of HPS, we detected the expression of HPS by western blots. In addition, a hepatic steatosis cell culture model was established by treatment of different  acids, including linoleic  (LNA), , palmitic , and stearic . The intracellular lipid accumulation was confirmed by oil red O staining. Blocking of STAT3 activity was achieved by the pretreatment of the STAT3 inhibitor, stattic. We found that activation of STAT3 by interleukin-6 (IL-6) was mediated in the regulation of HPS expression. Treatment of unsaturated  acids significantly induced intracellular lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Moreover, the expressions of HPS were increased in unsaturated  -treated HepG2 cells, as compared with saturated  -treated groups. Also, the expression of HPS induced by OLA was blocked by the inhibition of STAT3 activity. Furthermore, we found that deletion of HPS by small interfering ribonucleic  transfection decreased the protective effect of OLA on cell viability. Taken together, we provided evidence that STAT3 plays an important role in the regulation of OLA-induced HPS expression and the increased HPS may further participate in the development of NAFLD. In addition, the increase of HPS might be involved in the protective effect of OLA on cell viability.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29136950>A novel sesquiterpene glycoside from Loquat leaf alleviates -induced steatosis and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) leaf has displayed beneficial effect on metabolic syndrome. In our previously study, total sesquiterpene glycosides (TSG) isolated from Loquat leaf exhibited therapeutic effect on Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in vivo, but the accurate active compound remains unknown. Sesquiterpene glycoside 1 (SG1) is a novel compound, which is exclusively isolated from Loquat leaf, but its biological activity has been rarely reported. The present study was designed to evaluate the pharmacological effect of SG1, the main component of TSG, in  (OA)-induced HepG2 cell model of NAFLD with its related mechanisms of action. In this study, both SG1 and TSG were found to signiﬁcantly reduce the lipid deposition in the cell model. They could also decrease total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and intracellular free   (FFA) contents. Compared with OA-treated cells, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) level increased, and the malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal levels respectively decreased after the administration of SG1 or TSG. The high dose of SG1 (140 μg/mL) displayed a similar therapeutic effect as TSG at 200 μg/mL. Both SG1 and TSG were found to suppress the expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and the phosphorylation of c-jun terminal kinase (JNK) and its downstream target c-Jun in OA-treated cell. These results demonstrate again that TSG are probably the main responsible chemical profiles of Loquat leaf for the treatment of NAFLD, for which it can effectively improve OA-induced steatosis and reduce oxidative stress, probably by downregulating of CYP2E1 expression and JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation, while SG1 may be the principle compound.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We found that the expression of Plin5 was increased during OA-induced lipid droplets formation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. During this process of OA-stimulated lipid droplets formation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) was also upregulated. When PPARα activation was blocked by GW6471, OA-induced Plin5 expression and lipid droplets formation were effectively ablated. We further found that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 was able to downregulate both PPARα and Plin5 expression and lipid droplets formation.

In the studied pâtés, half of pork fat was replaced with a mixture consisting of canola and high- sunflower oil (75:25, v/v), thus improving their   profile in terms of polyunsaturated  acids (PUFA). In order to avoid the oxidation of PUFA in the new samples, seaweed extracts (500 ppm) were added. In addition, some samples were formulated with a synthetic antioxidant (BHT at 50 ppm) (BHT) and a control batch (CON) (without antioxidant) was also prepared, for comparison purposes. Thus, in total, five batches of  pâté were prepared: CON, BHT, AN, FV and BB. Pâté samples were analyzed at 0, 45, 90, 135 and 180 days of refrigerated storage at 4 °C. The addition of seaweed extracts did not modify significantly (P > 0.05) the chemical composition or microbial characteristics of healthy pork  pâté, except for the protein content, which resulted in a significant increase (≈2-3%) in the batches manufactured with addition of seaweed extracts compared to control samples. At the end of storage (180 days), L* values were significantly lower in the FV and BB batches than in the other batches. Moreover, the a* and b* values were also significantly lower in CON batches than in the samples with antioxidants added. Differences in oxidative parameters (conjugated dienes, TBARs and carbonyls) among batches were observed at the end of the storage time, showing samples with seaweed extracts a similar degree of protection against oxidation compared to BHT formulated samples. A decline of the volatile compounds was noted in all the batches during storage. The total volatile compounds at the end of the storage were significantly lower in BTH, AN, or BB batches than in control batches.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, C57BL/6 mice were fed 60 kcal% high-fat (HF) diet for eight weeks to induce  in vivo. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions were increased by FFA and HF-diet, but supplementation with CLW significantly decreased these levels. CLW treatment ameliorated antioxidant activities that were suppressed by exposure to the FFA and HF-diet. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and   transport proteins (FATP2 and FATP5) were increased in HF-diet groups, while CLW suppressed their expression levels. Moreover, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and   synthase (FAS) expression levels were down-regulated in the CLW groups compared to HF-diet groups. On the other hand, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) expressions were up-regulated in the CLW groups. HF-diet fed mice showed high hepatic triglycerides (TG) content compared to the normal diet mice.

Interestingly, -deficient mice show a decrease in the expression and maturation of the principal lipogenic transcription factor sterol receptor element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). The mechanisms mediating this effect on de novo lipogenesis and β-oxidation have not been fully elucidated. We evaluated the role of  on de novo lipogenesis and β-oxidation in HepG2 cells. We also used -deficient mice and two strains of transgenic mice that produce either oleate (GLS5) or palmitoleate (GLS3) in a -specific manner. We demonstrate that the expression of β-oxidation markers increases in -deficient hepatocytes and suggest that this is due to an increase in cellular polyunsaturated   content. We also show that the changes in the level of SREBP-1 expression, for both the precursor and the mature forms, are mainly due to the lack of oleate in -deficient hepatocytes. Indeed, oleate treatment of cultured HepG2 cells or hepatic oleate production in chow-fed GLS5 mice can restore SREBP-1 expression and increase hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Finally, we show that oleate specifically increases SREBP-1 nuclear accumulation, suggesting a central role for oleate in SREBP-1 signaling activity.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728499>Evidence for an alternative   desaturation pathway increasing cancer plasticity.</a></h2><p>Most tumours have an aberrantly activated lipid metabolism that enables them to synthesize, elongate and desaturate  acids to support proliferation. However, only particular subsets of cancer cells are sensitive to approaches that target   metabolism and, in particular,   desaturation.

We identify various cancer cell lines, mouse hepatocellular carcinomas, and primary human  and lung carcinomas that desaturate palmitate to the unusual   sapienate to support membrane biosynthesis during proliferation. Accordingly, we found that sapienate biosynthesis enables cancer cells to bypass the known   desaturation pathway that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase.

RT-qPCR was applied to detect the expression levels of miR-122 and pro-inflammatory cytokines following transfected with miR-122 inhibitor or treated with  (OA). Detection of lipid accumulation was performed by triglyceride content test and oil red o staining assay. Western blotting was applied to detect the protein levels of TLR7, TLR4, MyD88 and NF-κBp65.  We found that the OA promoted lipid accumulation and pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion and activated TLR4/MyD88/NF-κBp65 signalling pathway, which were restored following transfected with miR-122 inhibitor.  These results suggested that miR-122 inhibition alleviates lipid accumulation and inflammation in L02 cell induced by OA may through inhibiting TLR4/MyD88/NF-κBp65 signalling pathway.

The aim of this work was to assess the hypothesis that antioxidant-rich extra virgin olive oil (AR-EVOO) counteracts iron-rich diet (IRD)-induced oxidative stress hindering hepatic steatosis. Male Wistar rats were fed and IRD (200 mg iron/kg diet) versus a control diet (CD; 50 mg iron/kg diet) with alternate AR-EVOO supplementation (100 mg/day) for 21 days. IRD induced  steatosis and oxidative stress (higher levels of protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation with glutathione depletion), mitochondrial dysfunction (decreased citrate synthase and complex I and II activities) and loss of polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs), with a drastic enhancement in the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) ratio upregulating the expression of lipogenic enzymes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase,   (FA) synthase and stearoyl desaturase 2) and downregulating those involved in FA oxidation (carnitine palmitoyl transferase and acyl-CoA oxidase) over values in the CD group. IRD also upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its target genes. AR-EVOO supplementation alone did not modify the studied parameters, however, IRD combined with AR-EVOO administration returned IRD-induced changes to baseline levels of the CD group. It is concluded that IRD-induced non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is prevented by AR-EVOO supplementation, which might be related to the protective effects of its components such as hydroxytyrosol, , tocopherols and/or PUFAs, thus representing a suitable anti-steatotic strategy to avoid progression into more severe stages of the disease, underlying NAFLD associated with iron overloading pathologies or obesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the ethyl acetate fraction of Chinese olive fruit extract (CO-EtOAc) in the modulation of lipid accumulation in vitro and in vivo. In cellular studies, CO-EtOAc attenuated -induced lipid accumulation; we then elucidated the molecular mechanisms of CO-EtOAc in FL83B mouse hepatocytes. CO-EtOAc suppressed the mRNA levels of   transporter genes (CD36 and FABP) and lipogenesis genes (SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC1), but upregulated genes that govern lipolysis (HSL) and lipid oxidation (PPARα, CPT-1, and ACOX). Moreover, CO-EtOAc increased the protein expression of phosphorylated AMPK, ACC1, CPT-1, and PPARα, but downregulated the expression of mature SREBP-1c and FAS. AMPK plays an essential role in CO-EtOAc-mediated amelioration of lipid accumulation. Furthermore, we confirmed that CO-EtOAc significantly inhibited body weight gain, epididymal adipose tissue weight, and hepatic lipid accumulation via regulation of the expression of   transporter, lipogenesis, and   oxidation genes and proteins in C57BL/6 mice fed a 60% high-fat diet.

A Mass Spectrometry And Nuclear Magnetic Resonance - based metabolomics study.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a group of abnormalities that enhances the risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke. The Mediterranean diet seems to be an important dietary pattern, which reduces the incidence of MetS. Hydroxytyrosol (HT) - a simple phenol found in olive oil - has received increased attention for its antioxidant activity. Recently, the European Foods Safety Authority (EFSA) claimed that dietary consumption of HT exhibits a protective role against cardiovascular disease. In this study, an experimental protocol has been setup, including isolated HT administration in a diet induced model of MetS in young Wistar rats, in order to find out whether HT has a protective effect against MetS. Rats were randomly divided into two groups nurtured by high-carbohydrate high-fat (H) (MetS inducing diet) and high-carbohydrate high-fat + HT (HHT). HT (20mg/kg/d oral gavage, water vehicle) was administered for 8 weeks on the basal diet. Previous pharmacological evaluation of HT showed that hepatic steatosis was reduced and the inflammatory cells into the  were infiltrated. These indicate that HT shows bioactivity against metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the metabolomics evaluation of  extracts would indicate the putative biochemical mechanisms of HT activity. Thus, the extracts of  tissues were analyzed using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography - High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS, Orbitrap Discovery) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker Avance III 600MHz). Multivariate analysis was performed in order to gain insight on the metabolic effects of HT administration on the  metabolome. Normalization employing multiple internal standards and Quality Control-based Robust LOESS (LOcally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) Signal Correction algorithm (QC-RLSC) was added in the processing pipeline to enhance the reliability of metabolomic analysis by reducing unwanted information. Experimentally, HHT rats were clearly distinguished from H in PLS-DA, showing differences in the  metabolome between the groups and specific biomarkers were determined supporting the pharmacological findings. More specifically, HT has shown to be effective towards the mobilization of lipids as various lipid classes being differentially regulated between the H and HHT groups. Interestingly branched   esters of hydroxy  acids (OAHSA) lipids have been shown to be up regulated to the HHT group, denoting the alleviation of the MetS to the animals administered with HT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, ellagic  (EA) has drawn attention mainly due to its biological functionalities and a series of molecular targets. However, the molecular mechanism by which EA attenuates hepatic steatosis in individuals with undesirable hepatic genetic alterations remains rarely studied. Here, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of EA in a hepatic steatosis mouse model featuring elevated expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and its downstream modulators of lipogenesis by hydrodynamic injection of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT). Hematoxylin and eosin staining, oil red O staining, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were performed for mechanistic investigations. Human hepatoma cell lines were used for mechanical validation in vitro. The results suggest that EA lightens the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes of AKT-injected mice and an -induced in vitro hepatic steatosis model. Mechanistically, EA administration decreases the expression of phospho-AKT (Thr308) and suppresses two effectors lying downstream of the AKT/mTORC1 pathway, ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) and SREBP-1, in the AKT-injected mice. The consequence of the EA-mediated decrease of SREBP-1 is found to be a transcriptional and translational inhibition of   synthase (FASN), accompanied by the downregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Consistent with in vivo findings, EA efficiently represses the SREBP-1/FASN axis in vitro. Collectively, our study provides a novel mechanism whereby EA alleviates AKT-triggered hepatic de novo lipogenesis, indicating that EA might serve as a potential agent in the therapy of hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD and/or steatosis-associated complications, especially in that characterized by activation of AKT/mTORC1 signaling in the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361524>Maslinic  protects against obesity-induced nonalcoholic  disease in mice through regulation of the Sirt1/AMPK signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Maslinic  is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is distributed in the peel of olives.

However, the effect of procyanidin B2 on free  acids (FFAs)-induced hepatic steatosis remains obscure. The present study is therefore aimed to elucidate the protective effect of procyanidin B2 against hepatic steatosis and its underlying mechanism. Herein, we reported that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced lipid accumulation and its associated oxidative stress by scavenging excessive ROS and superoxide anion radicals, blocking loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, restoring glutathione content, and increasing activity of antioxidant enzymes (GPx, SOD and CAT) in hepatocytes. Procyanidin B2 mechanistically promoted lipid degradation via modulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal pathway. Molecular docking analysis indicated a possible ligand-binding position of procyanidin B2 with TFEB. In addition, administration of procyanidin B2 resulted in a significant reduction of hepatic fat accumulation in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, and also ameliorated HFD-induced metabolic abnormalities, including hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. It was confirmed that procyanidin B2 prevented HFD-induced hepatic fat accumulation through down-regulating lipogenesis-related gene expressions (PPARγ, C/EBPα and SREBP-1c), inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines production (IL-6 and TNF-α) and increasing antioxidant enzymes activity (GPx, SOD and CAT). Moreover, hepatic  acids analysis indicated that procyanidin B2 caused a significant increase in the levels of palmitic ,  and linoleic . Intriguingly, procyanidin B2 restored the decreased nuclear TFEB expression in HFD-induced  steatosis and up-regulated its target genes involved in lysosomal pathway (Lamp1, Mcoln, Uvrag), which suggested a previously unrecognized mechanism of procyanidin B2 on ameliorating HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced hepatic steatosis through regulating TFEB-mediated lysosomal pathway and redox state, which had important implications that modulation of TFEB might be a potential therapeutic strategy for hepatic steatosis and procyanidin B2 could represent a promising novel agent in the prevention and treatment of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

HepG2 cells were treated with palmitic/ for 24 h. The knockdown of Foxo1, Foxo3 was conducted through small interfering RNA (siRNA). Real time PCT (RT-PCR) was used to detect the changes of the SREBP1c and Aco genes in HepG2 cells after Foxo1/3 knockdown.  As expected, palmitic/ increased TG concentration in HepG2 cells [(12.65 ± 1.32) μg/mg vs. (4.32±0.54) μg/mg, 0.05]. Addition of GLP-1 dose (10, 50, 100nmol/L) dependently lowered the TG content and reached plateau at 100 nmol/L of GLP-1 [TG(8.38±1.47) μg/mg]. The GLP-1 effect on TG remained after knocking down either Foxo1 [(9.09±1.34)μg/mg] or Foxo3 [(8.90±1.60) μg/mg] alone, but not when knocking down Foxo1 and Foxo3 (Foxo1/3) together [(14.66±1.77)μg/mg]. Moreover, knocking down Foxo1/3 also abolished GLP-1 effect on SREBP1c and Aco expression.  GLP-1 can inhibit the synthesis of TG in hepatocytes depending on Foxo1 and Foxo3.

FAs have been shown to modulate the secretion of proteins from tumor cells, contributing to tumor survival. However, the secreted factors affected by FA have not been systematically explored. Here, we found that treatment of oleate, a monounsaturated omega-9 FA, promoted the proliferation of HepG2 cells. To examine the secreted factors associated with oleate-induced cell proliferation, we performed a comprehensive secretome profiling of oleate-treated and untreated HepG2 cells. A comparison of the secretomes identified 349 differentially secreted proteins (DSPs; 145 upregulated and 192 downregulated) in oleate-treated samples, compared to untreated samples. The functional enrichment and network analyses of the DSPs revealed that the 145 upregulated secreted proteins by oleate treatment were mainly associated with cell proliferation-related processes, such as lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, and ER stress. Based on the network models of the DSPs, we selected six DSPs (MIF, THBS1, PDIA3, APOA1, FASN, and EEF2) that can represent such processes related to cell proliferation.

Although NAFLD was first described in 1980, a complete understanding of the mechanism and causes of this disease is still lacking. Six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) plays a role in integrating inflammatory and nutritional signals with metabolism. Our previous study suggested that STAMP2 may be a suitable target for treating NAFLD. In the current study, we performed a focused drug-screening and found that cilostazol could be a potential STAMP2 enhancer. Thus, we examined whether cilostazol alleviates NAFLD through STAMP2. The in vivo and in vitro pharmacological efficacies of cilostazol on STAMP2 expression and lipid accumulation were analyzed in NAFLD mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and in HepG2 cell lines treated by  (OA), respectively. Cilostazol increased the expression of STAMP2 through transcriptional regulation in vivo and in vitro. Cilostazol also dampened the STAMP2 downregulation caused by the HFD and by OA in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Cilostazol activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vivo and in vitro, and AMPK functions upstream of STAMP2, and reversed downregulation of STAMP2 expression through AMPK in the NAFLD model. Cilostazol ameliorates hepatic steatosis by enhancing hepatic STAMP2 expression through AMPK. Enhancing STAMP2 expression with cilostazol represents a potential therapeutic avenue for treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29141573> Protective Effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil: Interaction between Its Chemical Composition and the Cell-signaling Pathways Involved in Protection.</a></h2><p>The  is an organ susceptible to a multitude of injuries that causes  damage, like steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ischemia-reperfusion injury.

We observed in patients who underwent weight loss surgery, a decrease in hepatic expression of M3 muscarinic receptors (M3R). We also observed that fat loading of hepatocytes, increased M3R expression. Based on these observations, we tested the hypothesis that M3R regulate hepatocyte lipid accumulation. Incubation of AML12 hepatocytes with 1 mM  resulted in lipid accumulation that was significantly reduced by co-treatment with a muscarinic agonist (pilocarpine or carbachol), an effect blocked by atropine (a muscarinic antagonist). Similar treatment of Hepa 1-6 cells, a mouse hepatoblastoma cell line, showed comparable results. In both, control and fat-loaded AML12 cells, pilocarpine induced time-dependent AMPKα phosphorylation and significantly up-regulated lipolytic genes (ACOX1, CPT1, and PPARα). Compound C, a selective and reversible AMPK inhibitor, significantly blunted pilocarpine-mediated reduction of lipid accumulation and pilocarpine-mediated up-regulation of lipolytic genes.

Importantly, there are currently no approved treatments available for NAFLD. This study aims to investigate the potential applications of sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) on improving the NAFLD condition using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. The results showed that STS markedly inhibited lipid accumulation in  (OA) and palmitic  (PA) treated HepG2 and primary immortalized human hepatic (PIH) cells. STS suppressed lipogenesis by inhibiting expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1),   synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). In addition, STS reduced inflammation in cells treated with OA-PA, shown by decreased transcriptional levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B). Consistently, protective effects on hepatic steatosis in db/db mice were observed after STS administration, demonstrated by decreased lipid accumulation in mouse hepatocytes. This protective effect might be associated with STS induced activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1 (PRKAA1) pathways.

MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs and has been reported to be involved in pathogenesis of NAFLD and related metabolic diseases. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which miR-150 regulate hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in high fat diet (HFD) induced NAFLD model. The expression of miR-150 was up-regulated dramatically in both human NAFLD patients and HFD mice model, as well as in hepatocytes treated with . miR-150 deficiency ameliorated the hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance significantly in NAFLD mice. miR-150 deficiency decreased the expression of genes related to   uptake, synthesis and gluconeogenesis, while increased the expression of genes related to   β-oxidation.

This study was conducted to examine the therapeutic effect of tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), a naturally occurring curcuminoid and a metabolite of curcumin, on  (OA)-induced steatosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. HepG2 cells were incubated with OA to induce steatosis, and then treated with various concentrations of THC. The results showed that THC treatment significantly decreased lipid accumulation in OA-treated HepG2 cells, possibly, by inhibiting the expression of the lipogenic proteins, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ),   synthase (FAS), and  -binding protein 4 (FABP4). Moreover, THC attenuated OA-induced hepatic lipogenesis in an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner, which was reversed by pretreatment with an AMPK inhibitor. THC promoted lipolysis and upregulated the expression of genes involved in β-oxidation. Glucose uptake and insulin signaling impaired in HepG2 cells incubated with OA were abated by THC treatment, including phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and downstream signaling pathways, forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), which are involved in gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis, respectively.

Hyperlipidemic rats treated with APNO showed a reduction in the total serum cholesterol similar to those treated with simvastatin, an increased body temperature by 1 °C, and a reduction in the body weight gain and mesenteric depot of white adipose tissue compared to the hyperlipidemic controls rats. There was an increase in the relative  weight of rats treated with APNO, without, however, any change in the serum markers of hepatic toxicity. In addition, there was an increase in the moisture and lipid content of the feces of the rats treated with APNO compared to the controls. Together, these results suggest that APNO has potential use in health foods and nutritional supplements to control hypercholesterolemia and obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29525610>Arctigenin protects against steatosis in WRL68 hepatocytes through activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B and AMP-activated protein kinase pathways.</a></h2><p>Arctigenin (ATG), a lignin extracted from Arctium lappa (L.), exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. We hypothesized that ATG exerts a protective effect on hepatocytes by preventing nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) progression associated with lipid oxidation-associated lipotoxicity and inflammation. We established an in vitro NAFLD cell model by using normal WRL68 hepatocytes to investigate  (OA) accumulation and the potential bioactive role of ATG. The results revealed that ATG inhibited OA-induced lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and inflammation in WRL68 hepatocytes, as determined using Oil Red O staining, thiobarbituric  reactive substance assay, and inflammation antibody array assays. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that ATG significantly mitigated the expression of acetylcoenzyme A carboxylase 1 and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and significantly increased the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. The 40 targets of the Human Inflammation Antibody Array indicated that ATG significantly inhibited the elevation of the U937 lymphocyte chemoattractant, ICAM-1, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-6sR, IL-7, and IL-8. ATG could activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways and could increase the phosphorylation levels of Akt and AMPK to mediate cell survival, lipid metabolism, oxidation stress, and inflammation. Thus, we demonstrated that ATG could inhibit NAFLD progression associated with lipid oxidation-associated lipotoxicity and inflammation, and we provided insights into the underlying mechanisms and revealed potential targets to enable a thorough understanding of NAFLD progression.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

FADS3 may therefore be the first methyl-end trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturase functionally characterized in mammals, but the proof of this concept is so far lacking in vivo. The present study therefore aimed at investigating further the putative in vivo synthesis of trans11,cis13-CLA from dietary trans-vaccenic  in rodents. During one week of pregnancy and two weeks post-partum, Sprague-Dawley female rats were fed two diets either high (10.0% of  acids and 3.8% of energy intake) or low (0.4% of  acids and 0.2% of energy intake) in trans-vaccenic . The trans11,cis13-CLA was specifically detected, formally identified and reproducibly quantified (0.06% of total  acids) in the mammary gland phospholipids of lactating female rats fed the high trans-vaccenic -enriched diet. This result was consistent with FADS3 mRNA expression being significantly higher in the lactating mammary gland than in the . Although the apparent metabolic conversion is low, this physiological evidence demonstrates the existence of this new pathway described in the lactating mammary gland and establishes the FADS3 enzyme as a reliable mammalian trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturase in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we show miR-27a attenuated hepatic de novo lipogenesis and alleviated obesity-initiated NAFLD through inhibiting Fasn and Scd1 in . Hepatic levels of miR-27a were significantly augmented in HFD-fed and ob/ob mice. Further studies demonstrated that miR-27a directly interacted with 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of hepatic Fasn and Scd1 mRNAs and reduced their expression levels in mice. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of miR-27a robustly blocked sodium oleate-induced triglyceride (TG) accumulation in mouse primary hepatocytes and reduced  TG contents in mice via repressing hepatic lipogenesis. Furthermore, ectopic expression of hepatic miR-27a impaired lipid contents of livers and attenuated NAFLD development through suppressing lipogenesis in HCD-fed and ob/ob mice. Together, our results reveal a critical role of miR-27a in lipid homeostasis of  and pathogenesis of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30208901>Increased serum concentration of ceramides in obese children with nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Hepatic lipid accumulation is closely related to the development of insulin resistance, which is regarded as one of the most significant risk factors of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Although the exact molecular pathway leading to impaired insulin signaling has not been definitively established, ceramides are suspected mediators of lipid induced hepatic insulin resistance. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the serum ceramides concentration in obese children with NAFLD.The prospective study included 80 obese children (aged 7-17 years, median 12 years) admitted to our Department to diagnose initially suspected  disease. Patients with viral hepatitis (HCV, HBV, CMV), autoimmune (AIH), toxic and metabolic (Wilson's disease, alfa-1-antitrypsin deficiency)  diseases and celiac disease were excluded. NAFLD was diagnosed based on pediatric diagnostic criteria in obese children with  steatosis in ultrasound (US) as well as elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) serum activity after exclusion of other major  diseases listed before. Ultrasonography was used as a screening method and for qualitative assessment of the steatosis degree (graded according to Saverymuttu scale). Advanced steatosis was defined as a score > 1. The total intrahepatic lipid content (TILC) was assessed by magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy (HMRS) which is the most accurate technique for assessment of ectopic fat accumulation. Fasting serum concentration of ceramides was measured in 62 children.NAFLD was diagnosed in 31 children. Significant, positive correlation was found between total serum concentration of ceramides and insulin (r = 0.3, p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.28, p = 0.03). Total ceramide concentration as well as specific  -ceramides (FA-ceramides) concentrations, namely: myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, , behenic and lignoceric were significantly higher (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, p = 0.007, p < 0.001, p = 0.035, p = 0.008, p = 0.003, p = 0.006, respectively) in children with NAFLD compared to controls (n = 14). Moreover, children with NAFLD had significantly higher activity of ALT (p < 0.001) and GGT (p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (p = 0.04), BMI (p = 0.046), waist circumference (p = 0.01) steatosis grade in ultrasound (p < 0.001) and TILC in HMRS (p < 0.001) compared to children without NAFLD. We did not find significant differences in total and FA-ceramide species concentrations between children with mild (grade 1) and advanced  steatosis in ultrasonography (grade 2-3).Elevated ceramide concentrations in obese patients together with their significant correlation with insulin resistance parameters suggest their association with molecular pathways involved in insulin signaling impairment known to be strongly linked to pathogenesis of non-alcoholic  disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28747926>Agonist-induced activation of human FFA1 receptor signals to extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 through Gq- and Gi-coupled signaling cascades.</a></h2><p>FFA1 is abundantly expressed in the , skeletal muscle, monocytes and nervous system, but is particularly abundant in pancreatic β cells. It is widely believed that FFA1 exerts its regulatory roles in a variety of physiological and pathological functions. In response to , FFA1 has been shown to induce the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) through a mechanism involving EGFR transactivation in a breast cancer cell line. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for ERK1/2 activation mediated by n-6 free   (LA) in HEK293 cells remains to be further elucidated.A FLAG-FFA1 vector was stably expressed in HEK293 cells. Western blot analysis was applied to investigate the change in LA-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation change in response to kinase inhibitors. Arrestin-2/3-specific siRNA was used to analyze the effect of arrestin-2/3 knockdown on FFA1-mediated ERK1/2 activation.We proved that activation of ERK1/2 by LA was rapid, peaking at 5 min. Further experiments proved that FFA1 couples to a Gq protein and activates PI-PLC, which induces the IP3/Ca and DAG/PKC signal pathways, both of which are involved in ERK1/2 activation. We also showed that there is no EGFR transactivation, arrestin-2/3 or Gβγ pathway participation in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Treating cells with PTX abolished ERK1/2 activation at a late time point (≥20 min), indicating a critical role for Gi subunits in FFA1-mediated ERK1/2 activation.Our study provides a detailed delineation of the LA-mediated activation of ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells that are stably transfected with human FFA1. We also present evidence of Gi/Gq-induced synergism in the regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These observations may provide new insights into the pharmacological effects of FFA1 and the physiological functions modulated by FFA1-mediated activation of ERK1/2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320914>Protein translation associated to PERK arm is a new target for regulation of metainflammation: A connection with hepatocyte cholesterol.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress is a cellular phenomenon that has been associated with metabolic disorders, contributing to the development of obesity,  disease, and dyslipidemias. Under metabolic overload conditions, in cells with a high protein-secretory activity, such as hepatocytes and Langerhans β cells, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is critical in to maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis). UPR integrated by a tripartite signaling system, through activating transcription factor 6, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1, regulates gene transcription and translation to resolve stress and conserve proteostasis. In the current study, we demonstrated in hepatocytes under metabolic overload by saturated palmitic and stearic  acids, through activation of PERK signaling and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) transcription factor, an association with the expression of cyclooxygenase 2. More important, isolated exosomes from supernatants of macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharides can also induce a metainflammation phenomenon, and when treated on hepatocytes, induced a rearrangement in cholesterol metabolism through sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein A-I, and ABCA1. Moreover, we demonstrate the cellular effect of terpene-derived molecules, such as cryptotanshinone, isolated of plant Salvia brandegeei, regulating metainflammatory conditions through PERK pathway in both hepatocytes and β cells. Our data suggest the presence of a modulatory mechanism on specific protein translation process. This effect could be mediated by eukaryotic initiation factor-4A, evaluating salubrinal as a control molecule. Likewise, the protective mechanisms of unsaturated  acids, such as  and palmitoleic  were confirmed. Therefore, modulation of metainflammation suggests a new target through PERK signaling in cells with a high secretory activity, and possibly the regulation of cholesterol in hepatocytes is promoted via exosomes.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727036>Supplementation of glycerol or fructose via drinking water to grazing lambs on tissue glycogen level and lipogenesis.</a></h2><p>Lambs ( = 18; 40.1 ± 7.4 kg BW) were used to assess supplementation of glycerol or fructose via drinking water on growth, tissue glycogen levels, postmortem glycolysis, and lipogenesis. Lambs were blocked by BW and allocated to alfalfa paddocks (2 lambs/paddock and 3 paddocks/treatment). Each paddock within a block was assigned randomly to drinking water treatments for 30 d: 1) control (CON), 2) 120 g fructose/L of drinking water (FRU), or 3) 120 g glycerol/L of drinking water (GLY). Lambs grazed alfalfa with free access to water treatments for 28 d and then were fasted in indoor pens for a final 2 d with access to only water treatments. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with water treatment and time (when appropriate) in the model. During the 28-d grazing period, ADG was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for CON or FRU. During the 2-d fasting period, BW shrink was lower ( < 0.05) for GLY compared with CON or FRU. Hot carcass weight was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for FRU. The interaction for glycogen content × postmortem time was significant ( = 0.003) in LM and semitendinosus (ST) muscles. Glycogen content in the LM was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY at 2 and 3 h and for FRU at 1 h postmortem compared with CON. Glycogen content in ST did not differ between treatments ( > 0.05).  glycogen content was over 14-fold greater ( < 0.05) for GLY compared with FRU or CON.  free glucose was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for CON, whereas  lipid content was higher ( < 0.05) for CON than for GLY. Supplementation with GLY increased ( < 0.05) odd-chain  acids in LM, subcutaneous fat (SQ), and the . Stearic  (C18:0) concentrations were reduced in LM ( = 0.064) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SQ; = 0.018), whereas  (C18:1 -9) concentration tended to be increased ( = 0.066) in SQ with FRU and GLY.

More recently, AnxA6 has also been linked to triglyceride storage in adipocytes. Here we investigated the potential role of AnxA6 in   (FA) - induced lipid droplet (LD) formation in hepatocytes. AnxA6 was associated with LD from rat  and HuH7 hepatocytes. In  (OA) -loaded HuH7 cells, substantial amounts of AnxA6 bound to LD in a Ca-independent manner. Remarkably, stable or transient AnxA6 overexpression in HuH7 cells led to elevated LD numbers/size and neutral lipid staining under control conditions as well as after OA loading compared to controls. In contrast, overexpression of AnxA1, AnxA2 and AnxA8 did not impact on OA-induced lipid accumulation. On the other hand, incubation of AnxA6-depleted HuH7 cells or primary hepatocytes from AnxA6 KO-mice with OA led to reduced FA accumulation and LD numbers. Furthermore, morphological analysis of  sections from A6-KO mice revealed significantly lower LD numbers compared to wildtype animals. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2α (cPLAα)-dependent LD formation was ineffective in AnxA6-depleted HuH7 cells. We conclude that cPLAα-dependent pathways contribute to the novel regulatory role of hepatic AnxA6 in LD formation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not clear yet. Here, we evaluated the relationship among hepatic mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-AKT2-insulin-induced gene 2 (Insig2) signaling, lipogenic transcription factors and lipid synthesis enzymes in obese mice with or without RYGB operation. Hepatic mTOR activity and Insig2a were stimulated, while AKT2, sterol response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and   synthase (FAS) were decreased by Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in both DMSO and rapamycin treated diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Increment of hepatic lipogenesis and decline of mTOR signaling induced by rapamycin were significantly reversed by RYGB in DIO mice. RYGB significantly improved high-fat diet- and rapamycin- induced hepatic steatosis by suppression of de novo lipogenesis. Administration of adenovirus-mediated p70 ribosomal protein subunit 6 kinase 1 (Ad-S6K1) from tail vein improved hepatic steatosis. Infusion of Ad-S6K1 suppressed AKT2, SREBP1c, PPARγ, and lipogenesis-related genes while stimulating Insig2a in DIO mice. Ad-S6K1 decreased -induced lipid deposition in primary mouse hepatocytes. Our results suggest that mTOR-AKT2-Insig2 signaling pathway contributes to the improvement effect of RYGB on hepatic steatosis induced by high-fat diet.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Creatine is a small molecule that plays a large role in energy metabolism, but since the enzyme creatine kinase is not present in the , the classical role in energy metabolism does not hold in this tissue. Fat accumulation in the  can lead to the development of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD), a progressive disease that is prevalent in humans. We have previously reported that creatine can directly influence lipid metabolism in cell culture to promote lipid secretion and oxidation. Our goal in the current study was to determine whether similar mechanisms that occur in cell culture were present in vivo. We also sought to determine whether dietary creatine supplementation could be effective in reversing steatosis. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet or a high-fat diet supplemented with creatine for 5 weeks. We found that rats supplemented with creatine had significantly improved rates of lipoprotein secretion and alterations in mitochondrial function that were consistent with greater oxidative capacity. We also find that introducing creatine into a high-fat diet halted hepatic lipid accumulation in rats with . Our results support our previous report that  cells in culture with creatine secrete and oxidize more , demonstrating that dietary creatine can effectively change hepatic lipid metabolism by increasing lipoprotein secretion and oxidation in vivo.

Sheng-jiang powder (SJP), an empirical Chinese medicine formula to treat NAFLD, showed great efficacy but the specific mechanisms have never been reported. Therefore, we performed this study to explore the effect of SJP on NAFLD and the potential mechanism.NAFLD was induced by high fat diet (HFD) feeding. Rats were treated with SJP/normal saline daily for 10 weeks and all rats were euthanized after 12 weeks' feeding.  tissue samples were obtained for biochemistry test and pathological evaluation. Additionally,  induced LO2 cells were employed to simulate a cell model of NAFLD. Cells were subjected to western blotting for Akt, mTOR, S6, SREBP1-c, and FASN detection after coincubated with SJP, LY294002 (a selective PI3K inhibitor), or the combination for 24h.HFD significantly induced hepatic steatosis. Plenty of lipid droplets were observed under transmission electron microscope. The ultrastructure of  cells showed distinct changes with obvious endoplasmic reticulum expansion, mitochondrial contraction, and cell matrix solidification. Although no difference was detected in serum hepatic enzymes and tissue proinflammatory cytokines, the tissue level of SOD and GSH-px was much lower and the pathologic injuries were much severe in HFD feeding rats. However, SJP treatment significantly attenuated the ultrastructure changes and protected rat  against inflammatory injury. Abundant of lipid droplets and high expression of pAkt, pmTOR, pS6, and FASN were observed in  treated LO2 cells, while these changes were restored by SJP treatment.SJP is efficient in attenuating HFD induced NAFLD in rats and this effect might be partly related to the inhibition of Akt/mTOR/S6 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30212593>Influence of  in different solvent media on BRL 3A cell growth and viability.</a></h2><p> (OA) is widely used in pathology studies of hepatocellular lipid deposition. Identifying the effects of different solvents on OA-induced  lipid deposition would be beneficial for studies on hepatocytes. We treated BRL 3A cells with OA dissolved in different solvents. After 12 h incubation, cell viability was assessed using MTT assays. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) counts, and the expression level of glucose regulated protein (GRP78), sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-1C) and   synthase (FAS) were analyzed. Water, PBS and DMSO were disadvantageous to the dissolution of OA and did not cause an OA-induced response in hepatocytes. In the alcohol+OA-treated cells, the severe ER stress, oxidative stress and cellular fat deposition were significantly increased. BSA promoted cell growth and the cells treated with 1.2% BSA+OA showed a lower grade TG and endoplasmic reticulum stress compared with KOH+OA and alcohol+OA treatments. KOH had no significant influence on BRL 3A cells viability. When treated with OA dissolved in KOH, BRL 3A cells showed a typical hepatocyte damage.

Apolipoprotein O (ApoO) is a new member of the plasma apolipoprotein family that may play a role in lipid metabolism and electron transport activity of the mitochondrium. However, its physiological functions have not been elucidated yet. Based on our previous data in a non-mammalian experimental system [1], we hypothesized that hepatic expression of ApoO is tightly linked not only to diet-induced hepatosteatosis, but also to increased lipoprotein-production induced by, e.g., hormones and oxidative stress. To gain insight into a mammalian experimental system, we compared the effects of lipid loading on ApoO regulation in chicken hepatoma LMH cells with those in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Incubation of the cells with BSA-complexed  (OA-Alb) induced triglyceride accumulation, but did not affect cell viability. qPCR using specific primer pairs and Western blot analysis with in-house produced rabbit anti-ApoO antisera demonstrated significant increase in ApoO transcript and protein levels in both cell lines. ROS formation due to OA-Alb treatment was only slightly altered in LMH cells, indicating an intact antioxidant defense system of the cells. Oxidative stress applied by addition of HO revealed induction of ApoO transcript and protein level in the same or even higher extent as monitored in the presence of OA-Alb. Upon treatment with estrogen for 24 h quantitative analysis of ApoO transcript and protein revealed increases of ApoO expression supporting the assumption that estrogen affects lipoprotein metabolism at various points. Furthermore, both cell lines showed a significant decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential upon incubation with OA-Alb. Therefore, we assume that our findings support a role of ApoO as an effector of compromised mitochondrial function that likely accompanies the onset of non-alcoholic  disease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Dietary fat triggers the synthesis of oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a regulatory   that signals satiety to reduce food intake mainly by enhancing neural PPARα activity, in enterocytes. We explored OEA's roles in the assembly of lipoproteins in WT and   mouse enterocytes and hepatocytes, Caco-2 cells, and human -derived cells. In differentiated Caco-2 cells, OEA increased synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerols, apoB secretion in chylomicrons, and MTP expression in a dose-dependent manner. OEA also increased MTP activity and triacylglycerol secretion in WT and knockout primary enterocytes. In contrast to its intestinal cell effects, OEA reduced synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerols, apoB secretion, and MTP expression and activity in human hepatoma Huh-7 and HepG2 cells. Also, OEA reduced MTP expression and triacylglycerol secretion in WT, but not knockout, primary hepatocytes. These studies indicate differential effects of OEA on lipid synthesis and lipoprotein assembly: in enterocytes, OEA augments glycerolipid synthesis and lipoprotein assembly independent of PPARα. Conversely, in hepatocytes, OEA reduces MTP expression, glycerolipid synthesis, and lipoprotein secretion through PPARα-dependent mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30202233>Anticandidal activity of the extract and compounds isolated from  Rottb.</a></h2><p>The phytochemical screening of  showed that carbohydrates and/or glycosides, flavonoids, tannins, sterols and/or triterpenes, and proteins and/or amino acids are present.

Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic  disease and is becoming an important public health concern worldwide. However, there is little knowledge about the effects of GEM on NAFLD. In the present study, oleate-treated human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells were utilized to investigate the role of GEM in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. The present results demonstrated that GEM attenuated excessive intracellular triglyceride content in the steatosis model. Upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) protein and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) was detected following treatment with GEM. Additionally, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that GEM increased the downstream genes related to PPARα and SREBP1, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, acyl-coA oxidase 1, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, LIPIN1 and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1. These findings demonstrated that GEM alleviated hepatic steatosis via the involvement of the PPARα and SREBP1 signaling pathways, which enhances lipid oxidation and interferes with lipid synthesis and secretion.

The extraction yield of betacyanins was optimized by response surface methodology. The optimal PHWE conditions were attained and the actual yields of betacyanins under optimal conditions were well matched with the predicted yields. In addition, betacyanin pigment compositions as well as superoxide anion scavenging activity of individual betacyanins extract (BE) produced in optimal PHWE conditions were characterized by HPLC-ESI/MS and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of three BEs on -induced steatohepatitis in cellular model was comparatively investigated.

It suggests that PHWE has a strong potentiality in keeping bioactivity of BEs, which is significant for the production of betacyanins functional foods.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430456>Pinolenic  ameliorates -induced lipogenesis and oxidative stress via AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Pinolenic  (PLA), a natural compound isolated from pine nut oil, has been reported to exert bioactivity against lipid anabolism. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms still poorly elucidated. The aim of this study is to comprehensively demonstrate the effects of PLA on  (OA)-induced non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and their relationship with the lipid metabolic regulation. The results demonstrated that treatment with PLA dramatically inhibited lipid accumulation, oxidative stress as well as inflammatory responses induced by  in HepG2 cells. PLA also obviously decreased the levels of cellular triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). As well as PLA stilled promoted the antioxidant enzymes activity including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Furthermore, PLA could increase the expressions of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase1 (HO-1) to alleviate oxidative damage. It also could reduce lipogenesis-related transcription factors expression, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1c),   synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). PLA treatment resulted in increasing phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) expression. However, pretreatment with compound C (inhibitor of AMPK) inhibited the effect of PLA on promoting the expression of p-AMPK, SIRT1 and PPARα for lipolysis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PLA possessed the potential to prevent lipid accumulation in OA-induced HepG2 cells via upregulating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway, which supported the development of new drug candidate against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Studies have indicated that abnormal fat metabolism, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance are positively correlated with peroxidation and abnormal cytokine production. Recent studies have revealed that Solanum nigrum extracts (SNE) possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, antihyperlipidemia, and  protection abilities. Therefore, the present study investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of an SNE on nonalcoholic  (NAFL)-induced hepatitis. In vivo data demonstrated that the SNE reduced blood triglyceride, sugar, and cholesterol levels, as well as fat accumulation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation in high-fat-diet-treated mice. The results indicated that the SNE downregulated the expression of   synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and upregulated the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Furthermore, we prepared a Solanum nigrum polyphenol extract (SNPE) from the SNE; the SNPE reduced hepatic lipid () accumulation. Therefore, SNE have the potential to alleviate NAFL-induced hepatitis, and polyphenolic compounds are the main components of SNE. Moreover, SNE can be used to develop health-food products for preventing NAFL disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30473486>Tannic , a novel histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, prevents non-alcoholic  disease both in vivo and in vitro model.</a></h2><p>We examined the potential of tannic  (TA) as a novel histone acetyltransferase inhibitor (HATi) and demonstrated that TA prevents non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) by inhibiting HAT activity.The anti-HAT activity of TA was examined using HAT activity assays. An in vitro NAFLD model was generated by treating HepG2 cells with  and palmitic acids. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet (CD) or Western diet (WD) with or without supplementation with either 1% or 3% TA (w/w) for 12 weeks. Finally, the possibility of interacting p300 and TA was simulated.TA suppressed HAT activity both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, TA abrogated occupancy of p300 on the sterol regulatory element in the   synthase and ATP-citrate lyase promoters, eventually inducing hypoacetylation of H3K9 and H3K36. Furthermore, TA decreased acetylation at lysine residues 9 and 36 of histone H3 protein and that of total proteins. Consequently, TA decreased the mRNA expression of lipogenesis-related genes and attenuated lipid accumulation in vivo. We observed that NAFLD features, including body weight,  mass, fat mass, and lipid profile in serum, were improved by TA supplementation in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated the possibility that TA directly binds to p300 through docking simulation between ligand and protein.Our findings demonstrate that TA, a novel HATi, has potential application for the prevention of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Daphnetin (DAP) possesses notable antioxidative, anti‑inflammatory and anticoagulant activities; DAP is an active ingredient extracted from Daphne Koreana Nakai. To investigate the effects and the underlying mechanism of DAP on NAFLD, we treated HepG2 cells with  (OA) and DAP simultaneously and non‑simultaneously. In the simultaneous treatment condition, HepG2 cells were co‑treated with 0.5 mM OA and DAP (5, 20, and 50 µM) for 24 h. In the non‑simultaneous treatment conditions, HepG2 cells were pretreated with 0.5 mM OA for 24 h, and then treated with DAP (5, 20 and 50 µM) for 24 h. Following the aforementioned treatments, the biochemical indexes associated with NAFLD were measured as follows: i) The intracellular contents of triglyceride (TG), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fluorescent glucose 2‑[N‑(7‑nitrobenz‑2‑oxa‑1,3‑diazol‑4‑yl) amino]‑2‑deoxyglucose were analyzed with corresponding detection kits; and ii) the cellular expression levels of glycolipid metabolism‑ and oxidative stress‑related genes, including 5'AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK), sterol regulatory element‑binding protein‑1C (SREBP‑1C), patatin‑like phospholipase domain‑containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor α (PPARα), phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), nuclear factor‑like 2 (Nrf2), cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and CYP4A were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results revealed the potential mechanism underlying the effects of DAP on NAFLD in vitro: i) By increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK, DAP inhibited the expression of SREBP‑1C and PNPLA3, and induced that of PPARα. Lipid accumulation within hepatocytes was reduced; ii) by upregulating PI3K expression and pAKT/AKT levels, DAP may alleviate insulin resistance and promote hepatocellular glucose uptake; and iii) by upregulating the expression of Nrf2, DAP downregulated the expression of CYP2E1 and CYP4A, and the levels of reactive oxygen species in hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340670>Diesel Exhaust Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Hyperlipidemia, and  Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized  acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with . As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and  did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse , with DE particles and  also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and  steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668424>Lycopus lucidus Turcz. ex Benth.

C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat) for 14 weeks to induce obesity and were treated with or without LLE (100 or 200  mg/kg daily by oral gavage).HepG2 cells were exposed to 1 mM FFA, with or without LLE (250 - 1000  mg/ml). Intracellular lipid contents were measured by Oil Red O staining and a Nile Red assay. The body weight, relative  weight, hepatic lipids, triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured in the mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TG, TC, glucose, insulin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined by biochemical or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histologic analysis was performed in the . Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic lipid metabolism.LLE significantly decreased the intracellular lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of lipogenesis genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the body weight, relative  weight, serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice. The hepatic TG and TC contents were significantly reduced in the LLE-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related obesity and metabolic disease.Copyright © 2018.

Saturated  acids induce autophagy dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leading to apoptosis in hepatocytes. However, unsaturated  acids, such as , are nontoxic and can even prevent saturated  -induced toxicity in vitro. Although emerging evidence has suggested that ER calcium flux disruption in hepatocytes is involved in NAFLD pathogenesis, the roles of  acids in autophagy and ER calcium flux still remain unclear. We demonstrated that  ameliorated palmitic -induced autophagy arrest and ER stress in parallel with ER calcium depletion in hepatocytes. Moreover, we found that the effect of  against autophagy arrest was reversed by the pharmacological inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA), which influxes calcium to ER. These data suggest that SERCA-mediated ER calcium flux is greatly involved in  -induced lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, and the prevention of ER calcium depletion may restore saturated  -induced autophagy arrest in hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Alterations in triglyceride metabolism, inflammation and oxidative status were monitored. Results show that IF mainly reduced triglyceride accumulation, TNF-α release and ROS activation in metabolic disordered cells. Next, a high-fat diet, which induced a non-alcoholic  disease, was used to evaluate the therapeutic action of IF. Our results show that treatment with IF significantly inhibited the high-fat diet-induced elevation in body weight,  weight, lipid metabolism (TG, TC and HDL-C) and hepatic injury in mice. In biochemical terms, treatment with IF resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of AMPKα and ACC, as well as reduced hepatic expression of FAS and HMGC, suggesting that lipogenesis was compromised. We also found robust evidence that treatment with IF significantly depleted infiltrating inflammatory cells (F4/80 Kupffer cells and CD68 macrophages) and inflammatory cytokine release (TNFα and IL-6). Moreover, the anti-inflammatory activity in IF-treated hepatic tissue correlated with down-regulation of TLR4 expression and NF-κB transcription.

This work was devised to investigate the potential effects of nimbolide on intracellular lipid deposition and its associated redox modulation in primary hepatocytes (Heps). Lipid accumulation was induced in Heps by supplementing 1 mM  for 24 h which was marked by significant accumulation of lipids. The results demonstrated that nimbolide can decrease intracellular cholesterol, free  acids and triglycerides. Nimbolide may also improve hepatocytes function through its antioxidant effects by inhibiting oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation by curtailing the reactive oxygen species levels.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the biological role and the underlying mechanisms of TREM-1 in NAFLD. upregulation of TREM-1 occurred in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice NAFLD model and -treated HepG2 and primary mouse hepatocytes cell model at messenger RNA and protein levels. Functional studies established that overexpression of TREM-1 displayed hyperlipidemia, and increased in inflammatory indicators and lipid accumulation-related genes, which was ameliorated by knockdown of TREM-1. Our results also showed that obvious lipid accumulation and inflammatory injury occurred in the  tissue of HFD-fed mice, while treatment with lentiviral vector short hairpin TREM showed marked improvement in tissue morphology and architecture and less lipid accumulation, thus deciphering the mechanism through which knockdown of TREM-1 ameliorated the inflammatory response and lipid accumulation of NAFLD mice through inactivation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and PI3K/AKT signal pathways, respectively. In conclusion, TREM-1/NF-κB and TREM-1/PI3K/AKT axis could be an important mechanism in ameliorating the inflammatory response and lipid accumulation, respectively, thus shedding light on the development of novel therapeutics to the treatment of NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

The experimental models included mice fed a high-fat diet combined or not with fructose (HFD+F) and HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells treated with the lipogenic agents palmitate, oleate or fructose. CYP4F2 protein, a cytochrome P-450 isoform with proposed α-tocopherol ω-hydroxylase activity, decreased in HFD and even more in HFD+F mice ; this finding was associated with increased hepatic levels of α-tocopherol and decreased formation of the corresponding long-chain metabolites α-13-hydroxy and α-13-carboxy chromanols. A decreased expression was also observed for PPAR-γ and SREBP-1 proteins, two vitamin E-responsive genes with key role in lipid metabolism and CYP4F2 gene regulation. A transient activation of CYP4F2 gene followed by a repression response was observed in HepG2 cells during the exposure to increasing levels of the lipogenic and cytotoxic agent palmitic ; such gene repression effect was further exacerbated by the co-treatment with  and α-tocopherol and was also observed for PPAR-γ and the SREBP isoforms 1 and 2. Such gene response was associated with increased uptake and ω-hydroxylation of α-tocopherol, which suggests a minor role of CYP4F2 in the enzymatic metabolism of vitamin E in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the  metabolism and gene response of α-tocopherol are impaired in experimental NAFLD.Copyright © 2017.

Its overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma impairs cholesterol homeostasis due to the altered activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2, which results in the accumulation of cellular cholesteryl esters (CE). In this work, we explored whether high cholesterol synthesis and esterification originates changes in glycerolipid metabolism that might affect cell growth, given that acetyl-coenzyme A is required for cholesterogenesis and  acids (FA) are the substrates of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). SND1-overexpressing hepatoma cells show low triglyceride (TG) synthesis, but phospholipid biosynthesis or cell growth is not affected. Limited TG synthesis is not due to low acetyl-coenzyme A or NADPH availability. We demonstrate that the main factor limiting TG synthesis is the utilization of FAs for cholesterol esterification. These metabolic adaptations are linked to high Scd1 expression, needed for the de novo production of , the main FA used by ACAT. We conclude that high cholesterogenesis due to SND1 overexpression might determine the channeling of FAs to CEs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, miR-1224-5p was highly expressed in the livers of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and in obese (ob/ob) mice. To examine the potential role of miR-1224-5p, we constructed -specific adenoviral vectors expressing either an miR-1224-5p inhibitor sequence or miR-1224-5p mimic sequences. After tail-vein vector injection, HFD-fed mice were examined for expression of lipogenic genes. We found that miR-1224-5p inhibitors significantly attenuated hepatic lipogenesis and steatosis in HFD-fed mice, whereas miR-1224-5p mimicked promoted lipid accumulation in the  of chow-fed C57BL/6 mice. Additional in vitro studies demonstrated that downregulation of miR-1224-5p in HepG2 and primary hepatocytes led to a reduction of cellular triglycerides after treatment with an  and palmitic  mixture. Importantly, this study also identified adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α1 as a direct target of miR-1224-5p. miR-1224-5p binding to the 3' untranslated region of AMPKα1 suppressed expression of the AMPKα1 protein and its downstream molecules. Metformin, an activator of AMPK, also inhibited hepatic expression of miR-1224-5p. Together, these findings indicate that miR-1224-5p promotes hepatic lipogenesis by suppressing AMPKα1 expression and suggest that miR-1224-5p inhibitors warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic tools in the treatment of nonalcoholic  disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30611723>Farnesol induces   oxidation and decreases triglyceride accumulation in steatotic HepaRG cells.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease is manifested by hepatic accumulation of triglycerides (TG) and is commonly associated with metabolic syndrome. The isoprenoid farnesol (FOH) modulates lipid metabolism and reduces hepatic TG content in rodents. This effect involves activation of at least two nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and farnesoid X receptor. We evaluated the effects of FOH (100 μM) in a cellular model of human hepatic steatosis by loading hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells with  (OA, 0.66 mM). FOH treatment decreased OA-induced TG accumulation by ~25%. Using PCR arrays, we found that FOH treatment modulated the mRNA levels of several lipid-metabolizing enzymes, both alone and when cells were loaded with OA. While FOH activated PPARα and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), most of the FOH-mediated effects on lipid-metabolizing genes could be attributed to activation of PPARα. In OA-loaded HepaRG cells, FOH increased   oxidation, which was accompanied by up-regulation of PPARα target genes involved in mitochondrial   oxidation, including hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase and acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2. These effects on gene expression were lost when the cells were co-treated with the PPARα antagonist, GW6471. OA treatment alone decreased the mRNA levels of the drug-metabolizing enzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, 2B6, and 3A4, and increased CYP2E1 expression, all of which were attenuated by FOH co-treatment. These findings show that FOH treatment increases   oxidation and decreases TG accumulation in steatotic HepaRG cells, which is likely attributable to PPARα-mediated induction of mitochondrial   oxidation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

One such bioactive lipid mediator, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), is a potent agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α), which modulates increased expression of the   translocase CD36 that enables the regulation of feeding behaviour. Consumption of dietary fat rich in  activates taste receptors in the gut activating specific enzymes that lead to the formation of OEA.

Additionally, malfunction of the enterocyte that transforms  produced during fat digestion into OEA might be responsible for reduced satiety and hyperphagia, resulting in overweight and obesity. Thus, OEA anorectic signalling may be an essential element of the physiology and metabolic system regulating dietary fat intake and obesity.

The 25F and 18F ground-beef increased (p < 0.05) the intake of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, palmitic , and stearic , but the 25F ground-beef increased only the intake of  (p < 0.05). The ground-beefs 18F and 25F increased the plasma concentration of palmitic  (p < 0.05) and decreased the plasma concentrations of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenic acids (p < 0.05). The interventions of 18F and 25F ground-beef decreased very low-density lipoprotein C concentrations and increased particle diameters and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations (p < 0.05). The ground-beef 25F decreased PBMC mRNA levels for the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette A, ATP binding cassette G1, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, and LDL receptor (LDLR) (p < 0.05). The ground-beef 18F increased mRNA levels for stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (p < 0.05). We conclude that the increased LDL particle size and LDL-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations following the 25F ground-beef intervention may have been caused by decreased hepatic LDLR gene expression.© 2018 AOCS.</p></html>
