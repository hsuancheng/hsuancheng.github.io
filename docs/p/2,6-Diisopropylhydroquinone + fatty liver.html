A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and %) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by microbiota profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain  acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain  acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and % of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the  in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680281></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622581>Atrial Fibrillation and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Patients With Nonalcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>The most common causes of chronic  disease in the developed world -nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - are the hepatic manifestations of an insulin-resistant state that is linked to visceral adiposity and systemic inflammation. NAFLD and NASH lead to an expansion of epicardial adipose tissue and the release of proinflammatory adipocytokines that cause microcirculatory dysfunction and fibrosis of the adjoining myocardium, resulting in atrial fibrillation as well as heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Inflammatory changes in the left atrium lead to electroanatomical remodeling; thus, NAFLD and NASH markedly increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. Simultaneously, patients with NAFLD or NASH commonly show diastolic dysfunction or latent HFpEF. Interventions include (1) weight loss by caloric restriction, bariatric surgery or intensive exercise; and () drugs that ameliorate fat-mediated inflammation in both the  and heart (e.g., statins, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter  inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and pioglitazone). Patients with NAFLD or NASH commonly have an inflammation-related atrial and ventricular myopathy, which may contribute to symptoms and long-term outcomes.Copyright © 2019.

Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1),  acid synthase (FAS), zinc α  glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured.  tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in , and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid metabolism in the  of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554849>Influence of dietary linseed oil as substitution of fish oil on whole fish  acid composition, lipid metabolism and oxidative status of juvenile Manchurian trout, Brachymystax lenok.</a></h2><p>In this study, juvenile Manchurian trout, Brachymystax lenok (initial weight: 6.43 ± 0.02 g, mean ± SE) were received for nine weeks with five types of diets prepared by gradually replacing the proportion of fish oil (FO) with linseed oil (LO) from 0% (LO0) to 25% (LO25), 50% (LO50), 75% (LO75), and 100% (LO100). The eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) composition decreased with increasing inclusion level of LO (P < 0.05). With increasing LO inclusion level, triglyceride (TAG) content of serum increased significantly, however, there was a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (P < 0.05). LO substitution of FO up-regulated the gene expression level of lipid metabolism-related genes  Acid Desaturases 6 (FAD6), Acetyl-Coa Carboxylase (ACCα), Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1 (SREBP-1), and Sterol O- Acyl Transferase  (SOAT2), and down-regulated the gene expression level of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor a (PPARα) (P < 0.05). The SOD activities of both serum and  in LO100 were significantly lower than in LO25 (P < 0.05). The CAT activity of the  in LO100 was significantly lower than in LO0 and LO25 (P < 0.05).

Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8), a member of the angiopoietin-like protein family, is involved in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and energy homeostasis and believed to be associated with T2DM. Expression levels of ANGPTL8 are often significantly altered in metabolic diseases, such as non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and diabetes mellitus. Studies have shown that ANGPTL8, together with other members of this protein family, such as angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), regulates the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), thereby participating in the regulation of triglyceride related lipoproteins (TRLs). In addition, members of the angiopoietin-like protein family are varyingly expressed among different tissues and respond differently under diverse nutritional and metabolic status. These findings may provide new options for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, metabolic syndromes and other diseases. In this review, the interaction between ANGPTL8 and ANGPTL3 or ANGPTL4, and the differential expression of ANGPTL8 responding to different nutritional and metabolic status during the regulation of LPL activity were reviewed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616396>SCFAs-Induced GLP-1 Secretion Links the Regulation of Gut Microbiome on Hepatic Lipogenesis in Chickens.</a></h2><p>The impact of gut microbiota and its metabolites on fat metabolism have been widely reported in human and animals. However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that  is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain  acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551515>NLRP3 inflammasome blockade reduces adipose tissue inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling.</a></h2><p>The NLRP3-IL-1β pathway plays an important role in adipose tissue (AT)-induced inflammation and the development of obesity-associated comorbidities. We aimed to determine the impact of NLRP3 on obesity and its associated metabolic alterations as well as its role in adipocyte inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Samples obtained from 98 subjects were used in a case-control study. The expression of different components of the inflammasome as well as their main effectors and inflammation- and ECM remodeling-related genes were analyzed. The impact of blocking NLRP3 using siRNA in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammation and ECM remodeling signaling pathways was evaluated. We demonstrated that obesity (P < 0.01), obesity-associated T2D (P < 0.01) and NAFLD (P < 0.05) increased the expression of different components of the inflammasome as well as the expression and release of IL-1β and IL-18 in AT. We also found that obese patients with T2D exhibited increased (P < 0.05) hepatic gene expression levels of NLRP3, IL1B and IL18. We showed that NLRP3, but not NLRP1, is regulated by inflammation and hypoxia in visceral adipocytes. We revealed that the inhibition of NLRP3 in human visceral adipocytes significantly blocked (P < 0.01) LPS-induced inflammation by downregulating the mRNA levels of CCL2, IL1B, IL6, IL8, S100A8, S100A9, TLR4 and TNF as well as inhibiting (P < 0.01) the secretion of IL1-β into the culture medium. Furthermore, blocking NLRP3 attenuated (P < 0.01) the LPS-induced expression of important molecules involved in AT fibrosis (COL1A1, COL4A3, COL6A3 and MMP2). These novel findings provide evidence that blocking the expression of NLRP3 reduces AT inflammation with significant fibrosis attenuation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675427>Effect of Metabolic Traits on the Risk of Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Cancer in Non-alcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is now the most common  condition. Predicting its progression could help clinicians manage and potentially prevent complications. We evaluated the independent and joint effects of metabolic traits on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with NAFLD. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008 with follow-up through 12/31/2015. We performed competing risk, adjusted cause-specific Cox models to evaluate the effects of metabolic traits (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity) as additive or combined indicators on time to develop cirrhosis or HCC or a composite endpoint of both. Of the 271,906 patients, 22,794 developed cirrhosis, and 253 developed HCC during a mean of 9 years follow up. At baseline, the mean BMI was 31.6 (SD, 5.6), 28.7% had diabetes, 70.3% hypertension, and 62.3% had dyslipidemia with substantial overlap among the these traits. The risk of progression was the lowest in patients with only one or no metabolic trait. There was a stepwise increase in risk with each additional metabolic trait. Compared to patients with no metabolic trait, patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia had 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis/HCC (hazard ratio (HR) =1.8, 95% CI=1.59-.06); the risk was .6-fold higher in patients with diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension (HR=.6, 95% CI=.3,.9). These associations were stronger for HCC. Diabetes had the strongest association with HCC in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Each additional metabolic trait increased the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in patients with NAFLD. Diabetes conferred the highest risk of progression to HCC. Diabetic patients with co-existing hypertension and obesity may be important targets for secondary prevention.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619310>Association between edible mushroom intake and the prevalence of newly diagnosed non-alcoholic  disease: results from the TCLSIH Cohort Study in China.</a></h2><p>Animal studies have suggested that mushroom intake can alleviate non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the association between mushroom intake and NAFLD is unknown in humans. We aimed to investigate the association of mushroom intake with NAFLD among Chinese adults. This is a cross-sectional study of 24,236 adults (mean [standard deviation] age: 40.7 [11.9] years; 11,394 men [47.0%]). Mushroom intake was assessed via a validated food frequency questionnaire. Newly diagnosed NAFLD was identified based on the results of annual health examinations, including ultrasound findings and a self-reported history of the disease. Multiple logistic models were used to examine the association between mushroom intake and NAFLD. The prevalence of newly diagnosed NAFLD was 19.0%. Compared to those consuming mushrooms less frequently (≤1 time/week), the fully adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of newly diagnosed NAFLD were 0.95 (0.86, 1.05) for those consuming -3 times/week and 0.76 (0.63, 0.92) for those consuming ≥4 times/week, respectively (P for trend = 0.01). The inverse association was consistent in subgroups defined by age, sex, and body mass index. In conclusion, higher mushroom intake was significantly associated with lower prevalence of NAFLD among Chinese adults.

However, the role of mainstream CS (MSCS) in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains unclear. During the first (early exposure) or last (late exposure) three weeks of methionine-choline deficient with high fat diet feeding (6 weeks), each diet group was exposed to MSCS (300 or 600 μg/L). Hepatic or serum biochemical analysis showed that MSCS differentially modulated hepatic injury in NASH milieu, depending on exposure time points. Consistently, NASH-related hepatocellular apoptosis and fibrosis were increased in the early exposure group, but decreased in the late exposure group, except for steatosis. Ex vivo experiments showed that CS extract differentially regulated inflammatory responses in co-cultured hepatocytes and macrophages isolated from steatohepatitic livers after 10 days or 3 weeks of diet feeding. Furthermore, CS differentially up- and down-regulated the expression levels of M1/M2 polarization markers and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) in livers (29% and 38%, respectively) or co-cultured macrophages ( and .5 fold, respectively). Collectively, our findings indicate that opposite effects of MSCS on NASH progression are mediated by differential modulation of PPARγ and its-associated M1/M2 polarization in hepatic macrophages, depending on exposure time points.Copyright © 2019.

Our research efforts have led to the identification of adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, with the former shown to activate AMP kinase in the  and the latter shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α signaling thereby increasing  acid oxidation. Again, adiponectin upregulates mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle thereby improving glucose/lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. These findings suggested that activation of adiponectin/AdipoR signaling could represent a viable therapeutic approach to lifestyle-linked diseases associated with prevalent obesity thus contributing to healthy longevity in humans. Indeed, they have led to the successful discovery of AdipoRon, a small-molecule AdipoR-activating compound. Thus far, AdipoRon has been found not only to improve insulin resistance in mice but to prolong their lifespan shortened by high-fat diet. Additionally, our structure-based drug discovery research has led to AdipoR being identified as an entirely novel structure having a zinc iron bound within its seven-transmembrane domain as well as an opposite orientation to that of G protein-coupled receptors. It is expected that increasing insight into AdipoR signaling will facilitate the structure-based optimization of candidate small-molecule AdipoR-activating compounds for human use as well as the development of molecularly targeted and calorie-limiting/exercise-mimicking agents for lifestyle-linked diseases.© The Japan Diabetes Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663469>Effects of pterostilbene on diabetes,  steatosis and serum lipids.</a></h2><p>Pterostilbene, a phenolic compound derived from resveratrol, possesses greater bioavailability than its parent compound due to the presence of two methoxyl groups. In this review, the beneficial effects of pterostilbene on diabetes,  steatosis and dyslipidemia are summarized. Pterostilbene is a useful bioactive compound in preventing type 1 diabetes, insulin resistance and type  diabetes in animal models. Concerning type 1 diabetes, the main mechanisms described to justify the positive effects of this phenolic compound are increased  glycogen content and hepatic glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities, the recovery of pancreatic islet architecture, cytoprotection and a decrease in serum and pancreatic pro-inflammatory cytokines. As for type  diabetes, increased  glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase and decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activities are reported. When insulin resistance is induced by diets, a greater activation of insulin signaling cascade has been reported, increased cardiotrophin-1 levels and  glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities, and a decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activity. Data concerning pterostilbene and  steatosis are scarce so far, but the reduction in oxidative stress induced by pterostilbene may be involved since oxidative stress is related to the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis. Finally, pterostilbene effectivelly reduces total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, while increases HDL-cholesterol in animal models of dyslipidemia.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559605>Non-obese histologically confirmed NASH patients with abnormal  biochemistry have more advanced fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) commonly affects subjects with obesity, yet non-obese NAFLD is increasingly being recognized.

Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been recognized as key mechanisms in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. Whether Orai1 facilitates ER stress by oxidative stress remains unknown. The rat model of NAFLD was constructed by feeding high-fat diet (HFD). BRL-3A cells were treated with NEFAs, Orai1inhibtor BTP2, NFκB inhibitor wogonin, or small interfering Orai (siOrai) 1, respectively. The content of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating oxidative stress, was measured by a spectrophotometer. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, CHOP, and GRP78 were quantified using Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. For the intracellular location of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Orai1 were measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence, and cytosolic Ca was measured by flow cytometry. As we expected, the  of rats with NAFLD showed lipid droplets in HE and Oil Red O. The decreased GSH and increased MDA were found in rats fed with HFD. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly increased in the HFD group. In BRL-3A cells, GSH content dramatically decreased from 1 h, MDA content dramatically increased from 3 h, and expression levels of ER stress significantly increased from 3 h by NEFA treatment. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca increased from 0.5 h by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. It indicated that NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca to induce oxidative stress, thus ER stress. The content of oxidative stress and ER stress proteins showed the same trends by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. These effects were reversed by the Orai1 inhibitor BTP2 and the NFκB inhibitor wogonin. Moreover, siOrai1 abrogated NEFAs' influence in BRL-3A cells. Last, ROS was found by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells, and NEFA treatment enhanced the nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and ORAI1. It was considered that high NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca and enhanced NFκB-dependent SOCE and its moiety protein Orai1 to decrease GSH and thus induced oxidative stress at earlier stages and furthermore tempted ER stress in the pathologic progress of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Li, Zou, Guo, Zhang, Xia, Zhang, Yang and Xu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555572>Role of Soluble Adiponectin Receptor  in Non-Alcoholic  Disease in Children.</a></h2><p>The incidence of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in children is gradually increasing. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of serum adiponectin and soluble adiponectin receptor  (soluble Adipo R2) levels for the diagnosis of  disease in obese and overweight children.The study included 51 obese and overweight children between the ages of 6 and 18 years diagnosed with NAFLD using ultrasonography and 20 children without  disease. Patients whose alanine transaminase level was two times higher than normal (≥80 U/L) were included in the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) group.NASH was observed in 11 (21.6%) of the patients with NAFLD. The incidence of obesity was higher in patients with NASH (80% and 45%, =0.021). While the adiponectin levels were similar in patients with NAFLD and those without, they were below the normal level in the whole study group. Adiponectin and soluble Adipo R2 levels of patients with NASH were lower than those in patients without NASH; however, this difference was not statistically significant (=0.064 and =0.463). Soluble Adipo R2 levels in obese patients with NAFLD were higher than those in obese children without NAFLD (<0.001).Soluble adiponectin receptor  level is a noninvasive marker that can be used for the diagnosis of NAFLD in obese children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598919>A Nationwide Study of Inpatient Admissions, Mortality, and Costs for Patients with Cirrhosis from 2005 to 2015 in the USA.</a></h2><p> cirrhosis is a substantial health burden in the USA, but population-based data regarding the trend and medical expenditure are limited and outdated. We investigated the trends of inpatient admissions, costs, and inpatient mortality from 2005 to 2015 among cirrhotic patients.A retrospective analysis was conducted using the National Inpatient Sample database. We adjusted the costs to 2015 US dollars using a 3% inflation rate. National estimates of admissions were determined using discharge weights.We identified 1,627,348 admissions in cirrhotic patients between 2005 and 2015. From 2005 to 2015, the number of weighted admissions in cirrhotic patients almost doubled (from 505,032 to 961,650) and the total annual hospitalization cost in this population increased three times (from 5.8 to 16.3 billion US dollars). Notably, admission rates varied by  disease etiology, decreasing from 2005 to 2015 among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis while increasing (almost tripled) among patients with nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD)-related cirrhosis. The annual inpatient mortality rate per 1000 admissions overall decreased from 63.8 to 58. between 2005 and 2015 except for NAFLD (27. to 35.8) (P < 0.001).Rates and costs of admissions in cirrhotic patients have increased substantially between 2005 and 2015 in the USA, but varied by  disease etiology, with decreasing rate for HCV-associated cirrhosis and for HBV-associated cirrhosis but increasing for NAFLD-associated cirrhosis. Inpatient mortality also increased by one-third for NAFLD, while it decreased for other diseases. Cost also varied by etiology and lower for HCV-associated cirrhosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580165>Variations in laboratory parameters in prechronic disease to determine disease occurrence at the molecular level.</a></h2><p> Change at a molecular level should occur before histopathological impairments.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of miR-1296 as a non-invasive biomarker in nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD).Serum samples were collected from normal people and NAFLD patients for biochemical detection. Serum microRNAs were isolated by the NucleoZOL method, and the stem-loop method was used to reverse transcribe the DNA. The relative quantification of miR-1296 was performed by SYBR Green method. Spearman's method was used to analyze the correlation between miR-1296 and serum biochemical parameters.By using -∆∆CT method, we found that, compared with the normal control group, the expression of serum miR-1296 increased in patients with normal lipid NAFLD and those with hyperlipidemia NAFLD. At the same time, the expression of microRNA-1296 in the NAFLD hyperlipidemia group increased more significantly than that in the NFALD group with normal lipid. Spearman's correlation assay demonstrated that the correlation between the expression of miR-1296 and blood lipids, including TC, TG, HDL-c, and LDL-c, was TC (r = 0.4951, p = 0.0013), TG (r = 0.054, p = 0.6425), HDL-C (r = 0.3435, p = 0.07522), and LDL-C (r = 0.3307, p = 0.0699. The data showed that miR-1296 was positively correlated with serum TC level.In summary, serum microRNA-1296 is a more sensitive marker of NAFLD than blood lipids, which provides a new method for noninvasive early screening of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599742>The Impact of Obesity and Type  Diabetes on Chronic  Disease.</a></h2><p>The growing global epidemic of obesity and type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has led to the increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic  disease.

However, little is known about the relationship between postsurgical robust parathyroid hormone (PTH) reduction and perisurgical renal tubular cell viability. Post-PTX kidney function is still a crucial issue for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and tertiary hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation (THPT).As a clinical study, we examined data from 52 consecutive patients (45 with PHPT, 7 with THPT) who underwent PTX in our center between 2015 and 2017 to identify post-PTX kidney injury. Their clinical data, including urinary -type  acid-binding protein (L-FABP), a tubular biomarker for acute kidney injury (AKI), were obtained from patient charts. An absolute change in serum creatinine level of 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µmol/L) on Day  after PTX defines AKI. Post-PTX calcium supplement dose adjustment was performed to strictly maintain serum calcium at the lower half of the normal range. To mimic post-PTX-related kidney status, a unique parathyroidectomized rat model was produced as follows: 13-week-old rats underwent thyroparathyroidectomy (TPTX) and/or 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy (NX). Indicated TPTX rats were given continuous infusion of a physiological level of 1-34 PTH using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump. Immunofluorescence analyses were performed by polyclonal antibodies against PTH receptor (PTHR) and a possible key modulator of kidney injury, Klotho.Patients' estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not have any clinically relevant change (62.5 ± 22.0 versus 59.4 ± 21.9 mL/min/1.73 m, NS), whereas serum calcium (.7 ± 0.18 versus . ± 0.16 mmol/L, P < 0.0001) and phosphorus levels (0.87 ± 0.19 versus 1.1 ± 0.23 mmol/L, P < 0.0001) were normalized and PTH decreased robustly (181 ± 99.1 versus 23.7 ± 16.8 pg/mL, P < 0.0001) after successful PTX. However, six patients who met postsurgical AKI criteria had lower eGFR and greater L-FABP than those without AKI. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis revealed eGFR <35 mL/min/1.73 m had 83% accuracy. Strikingly, L-FABP >9.8 µg/g creatinine had 100% accuracy in predicting post-PTX-related AKI. Rat kidney PTHR expression was lower in TPTX. PTH infusion (+PTH) restored tubular PTHR expression in rats that underwent TPTX. Rats with TPTX, +PTH and 5/6 NX had decreased PTHR expression compared with those without 5/6 NX. 5/6 NX partially cancelled tubular PTHR upregulation driven by +PTH. Tubular Klotho was modestly expressed in normal rat kidneys, whereas enhanced patchy tubular expression was identified in 5/6 NX rat kidneys. This Klotho and expression and localization pattern was absolutely canceled in TPTX, suggesting that PTH indirectly modulated the Klotho expression pattern. TPTX +PTH recovered tubular Klotho expression and even triggered diffusely abundant Klotho expression. 5/6 NX decreased viable tubular cells and eventually downregulated tubular Klotho expression and localization.Preexisting tubular damage is a potential risk factor for AKI after PTX although, overall patients with hyperparathyroidism are expected to keep favorable kidney function after PTX. Patients with elevated tubular cell biomarker levels may suffer post-PTX kidney impairment even though calcium supplement is meticulously adjusted after PTX. Our unique experimental rat model suggests that blunted tubular PTH/PTHR signaling may damage tubular cell viability and deteriorate kidney function through a Klotho-linked pathway.© The Author(s) 2019.

It is often related to metabolic syndrome, presenting an increased risk of advanced  disease and cardiovascular-related death. In some etiologies of chronic  disease, thrombocytopenia has been associated not only with advanced stages of fibrosis but also with autoimmune disease. In NAFLD, however, its prevalence and related factors are still unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of thrombocytopenia in NAFLD patients without cirrhosis and to investigate its related risk factors.This was a retrospective study carried out in two tertiary hospitals in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. Patients diagnosed with NAFLD by  biopsy were included. Those with other causes of  disease and/or cirrhosis were excluded. For analysis, patients were divided into two groups, with and without thrombocytopenia. Data was analyzed using a significance level of 5%.441 non-cirrhotic patients with NAFLD (evaluated by  biopsy) were included in the study. The prevalence of thrombocytopenia was 3.% (14/441 patients). In the comparative analysis between groups, thrombocytopenia was associated with male sex (p=0.007) and level of hemoglobin (p=0.023).Thrombocytopenia is an infrequent event in NAFLD patients without cirrhosis and is related with male sex and higher hemoglobin levels.Copyright © 2019 Fundación Clínica Médica Sur, A.C.

Dietary fiber and phytochemicals are bioactive grain compounds, which could be involved in mediating these beneficial effects. These compounds are not equally distributed in the wheat grain, but are enriched in the bran and aleurone fractions. As little is known on physiological effects of different wheat fractions, the aim of this study was to investigate this aspect in an obesity model. For twelve weeks, C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat diets (HFD), supplemented with one of four wheat fractions: whole grain flour, refined white flour, bran, or aleurone. The different diets did not affect body weight, however bran and aleurone decreased  triglyceride content, and increased hepatic n-3 polyunsaturated  acid (PUFA) concentrations. Furthermore, lipidomics analysis revealed increased PUFA concentration in the lipid classes of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC-ether, and phosphatidylinositol in the plasma of mice fed whole grain, bran, and aleurone supplemented diets, compared to refined white flour. Furthermore, bran, aleurone, and whole grain supplemented diets increased microbial α-diversity, but only bran and aleurone increased the cecal concentrations of short-chain  acids. The effects on hepatic lipid metabolism might thus at least partially be mediated by microbiota-dependent mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648561>KLF15-activating Twist2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis by inhibiting inflammation and improving mitochondrial dysfunction  NF-κB-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway.</a></h2><p>Twist-related protein  (TWIST2) is identified as a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription repressor by dimerizing with other b-HLH proteins. The significance of TWIST2 has been emphasized in various tumors; however, few studies report its functions in metabolism and metabolic diseases. Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κB negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κB expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by insulin-targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA.

It is mainly produced by recombinant microorganisms (Candida famata, Bacillus subtilis and Ashbya gossypii). The availability of genetically modified organism (GMO)-free riboflavin, obligatory in European organic agriculture, is a major issue. Besides, requirements for organic livestock might differ from conventional production because other genotypes and feed formulations are used. The effects of a fermentation suspension with a high native content of riboflavin produced with unmodified A. gossypii by fermentation were investigated at graded dosages as an alternative to conventional (GMO-based) riboflavin in slow-growing broilers on performance traits and health and welfare indicators. In  runs with 800 animals each, Ranger Gold™ broilers were fed with 4 dietary treatments. For starter diets (day 1 to 18), treatments included a basal diet (1) without any riboflavin supplementation (negative control, N-C), () with conventional riboflavin supplementation (Cuxavit B2 80% riboflavin) at 9.6 mg/kg (positive control, P-C), (3) with riboflavin supplementation from the alternative source at 3.5 mg/kg (A-low) and (4) with riboflavin supplementation from the alternative source at 9.6 mg/kg (A-high). For the finisher diet (day 29 until slaughtering), P-C and A-high were supplemented with 8.0 mg/kg and A-low with 3.5 mg/kg. Diets were formulated according to organic regulations. Animals were kept in floor pens with 20 chickens per pen. Weekly, BW, feed and water consumption were recorded. Every second week, animal-based health and welfare indicators (feather score and footpad dermatitis) were scored. Slaughter traits were assessed for five males and females per pen at 62/63 days of age. Final body weight of A-high differed from N-C and A-low, but not from P-C. From week  until six years of age, A-high had a higher daily weight gain when compared to all other groups. With 74.4%, dressing percentage was higher in A-high compared with all other groups (73.3%). Breast percentage of A-low was lower than that of both control groups but did not differ from A-high. The highest frequency of  scores indicating  syndrome was found in P-C, followed by N-C and A-low. Feather scores did not respond to treatment; the highest frequency of mild footpad dermatitis was observed in A-high, however at a low prevalence. In conclusion, the tested fermentation suspension with a high native content of riboflavin derived from fermentation of A. gossypii can be used at levels of commercial recommendations as alternative to riboflavin produced from GMO in broiler feeding. Further studies must verify whether riboflavin can be reduced without inducing riboflavin deficiency in slow-growing broilers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644993>Association between nonalcoholic  disease with advanced fibrosis and stroke.</a></h2><p>There is an increasing appreciation of the cardiovascular implications of nonalcoholic  disease with advanced fibrosis (NAFLD-fibrosis). However, data regarding stroke risk are limited. We sought to investigate whether NAFLD-fibrosis is associated with stroke in addition to heart disease.We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2014). After excluding participants with competing causes of  disease, the Fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) and NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) were calculated. First, we used a composite measure to classify participants: NAFLD-fibrosis was defined as having at least one score above its validated cut-off. Second, we also used the FIB-4 and NFS scores individually. The key outcome was prevalent stroke, and we also evaluated heart disease; both were self-reported. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the association between NAFLD-fibrosis and these outcomes while adjusting for demographic variables and cardiovascular risk factors.We identified 1653 participants with NAFLD-fibrosis from a sample of 27,040 participants. In total, 753 had prior stroke. An association between NAFLD-fibrosis and stroke was seen when using the FIB-4 score (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.00-3.50) but not the NFS (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.92-1.87). NAFLD-fibrosis was associated with heart disease (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.06-.01) using the composite measure and both scores individually.NAFLD-fibrosis may be associated with stroke in addition to heart disease, with differences depending on the measure used to define NAFLD-fibrosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluated the 10-year risk of CVD, clinical and menopause characteristics in all subjects.Among the 569 diabetic patients, the incidence of smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, overweight or obesity, and nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) was 0.7, 36., 38.1 56.6 and 58.%, respectively. The usage rate of hypoglycemic agents, antihypertensive agents, lipid modulators and antithrombotic drugs was 88.6, 78.3, 50.0 and 27.1%, respectively. However, only 1.% of inpatients achieved the three target goals for the control of blood glucose (HbA < 7%), blood pressure (systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg), and blood lipids (total cholesterol < 174 mg/dL). The 10-year risk of CVD was (1.6 ± 1.5%) and tended to increase along with age (F = 27.726, P <  0.001). For all subjects (n = 569), multiple linear regression analysis showed that menopause (β = 0.275, P <  0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (β = 0.212, P <  0.001), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (β = 0.093, P = 0.018) and waist-to-hip-ratio (β = - 0.078, P = 0.047) were risk factors of 10-year risk of CVD, which may explain the variance of 14.3%. In the postmenopausal group (n = 397), LDL-C (β = 0.227, P <  0.001), FPG (β = 0.139, P = 0.003) and time since menopause (β = 0.230, P <  0.001) were found to be associated with CVD, which may explain the variance of 14.6%.The incidence of dyslipidmia, hypertension, overweight or obesity and NAFLD is high. The level of control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood lipids was found to be extremely low and the treatment status was not ideal. Besides menopause, LDL-C, FPG and time since menopause were found to be independent risk factors for the 10-year risk of CVD.

Leukocyte migration inhibitors are considered as promising and potentially effective therapeutic agents to treat inflammatory and auto-immune disorders. In this study, based on previous trioxotetrahydropyrimidin based integrin inhibitors that suboptimally blocked leukocyte adhesion, twelve molecules with a modified scaffold were designed, synthesized, and tested in vitro for their capacity to block the transendothelial migration of immune cells. One of the molecules, namely, methyl 4-((-(tert-butyl)-6-((,4,6-trioxotetrahydropyrimidin-5(2H)-ylidene) methyl) phenoxy) methyl) benzoate, (compound 12), completely blocked leukocyte transendothelial migration, without any toxic effects on immune or endothelial cells (IC = .4 µM). In vivo, compound 12 exhibited significant therapeutic effects in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)/Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis,  disease, and rheumatoid arthritis models. A detailed acute and chronic toxicity profile of the lead compound in vivo did not reveal any toxic effects. Such a type of molecule might therefore provide a unique starting point for designing a novel class of leukocyte transmigration blocking agents with broad therapeutic applications in inflammatory and auto-immune pathologies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high-fat diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10).  histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with  acid with or without myriocin treatment. Lipid accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults,  biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and  biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated body weight and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated  pathology including steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of  acid metabolism associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced NASH, and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in NASH patients as compared to the controls and non-NASH patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hence, blockade of ceramide signaling by myriocin may be of therapeutically beneficial in NASH.Registration ID: ChiCTR-DDT-13003983 .

Although the mechanisms involved are likely complex, these associations suggest that lowering circulating ceramide levels could be protective against cardiovascular diseases. Conversely, dietary fibers, such as inulin, have been reported to promote cardiovascular and metabolic health. However, the mechanisms involved in these protective processes also are not well understood. We studied the effects of inulin on lipid metabolism with a model of atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient mice using lipidomics and transcriptomics. Plasma and tissues were collected at 10 days and/or 12 weeks after feeding mice an atherogenic diet supplemented with inulin or cellulose (control). Compared with controls, inulin-fed mice displayed a decreased C16:0/C24:0 plasma ceramide ratio and lower levels of circulating ceramides associated with VLDL and LDL.  transcriptomic analysis revealed that Smpd3, a gene that encodes neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase), was downregulated by -fold in inulin-fed mice. Hepatic NSMase activity was 3-fold lower in inulin-fed mice than in controls. Furthermore,  redox status and compositions of phosphatidylserine and free  acid species, the major factors that determine NSMase activity, also were modified by inulin. Taken together, these results showed that, in mice, inulin can decrease plasma ceramide levels through reductions in NSMase expression and activity, suggesting a mechanism by which fiber could reduce cardiometabolic disease risk.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615062>Acetate Affects the Process of Lipid Metabolism in Rabbit , Skeletal Muscle and Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>Short-chain  acids (SCFAs) (a microbial fermentation production in the rabbit gut) have an important role in many physiological processes, which may be related to the reduced body fat of rabbits. In the present experiment, we study the function of acetate (a major SCFA in the rabbit gut) on fat metabolism. Ninety rabbits (40 days of age) were randomly divided into three groups: a sham control group (injection of saline for four days); a group experiencing subcutaneous injection of acetate for four days ( g/kg BM per day, one injection each day, acetate); and a pair-fed sham treatment group. The results show that acetate-inhibited lipid accumulation by promoting lipolysis and  acid oxidation and inhibiting  acid synthesis. Activated G protein-coupled receptor 41/43, adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/ signal pathways were likely to participate in the regulation in lipid accumulation of acetate. Acetate reduced hepatic triglyceride content by inhibiting  acid synthesis, enhancing  acid oxidation and lipid output. Inhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α () and activated AMPK and ERK1/ signal pathways were related to the process in . Acetate reduced intramuscular triglyceride level via increasing  acid uptake and  acid oxidation. PPARα was associated with the acetate-reduced intracellular fat content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675219>Hepatic metabolomic and transcriptomic responses induced by cecal infusion of sodium propionate in a fistula pig model.</a></h2><p>Short-chain  acids (SCFAs) are the major products of the microbial fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates. SCFAs are known to improve host metabolism but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL,  mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and  triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid metabolism related stearic acid and glycerol--phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic acid, fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic acid; and decreased levels of the amino acid metabolism products aspartic acid and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited  acid synthesis and promoted lipid metabolic process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased glycolysis. Taken together, these data support a role of the SCFA propionate on host lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652711>Ubiquinol Supplementation Alters Exercise Induced Fatigue by Increasing Lipid Utilization in Mice.</a></h2><p>Ubiquinol (QH), a reduced form of coenzyme Q10, is a lipid antioxidant that is hydro-soluble and is commonly formulated in commercial supplements. Ubiquinol has been increasingly reported to exert antioxidant functions, in addition to its role in the cell energy-producing system of mitochondria and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of QH on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Forty 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into four groups ( = 10 for each group): Group 1 (vehicle control or oil only); Group  (1X QH dose or 102.5 mg/kg); Group 3 (2X QH dose or 205 mg/kg); Group 4 (6X QH dose or 615 mg/kg). Anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were studied using the forelimb grip strength experiment and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatine kinase (CK), and free  acids (FFA) after an acute exercise challenge. The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the  and muscle glycogen content, an important energy source during exercise. Therefore, the results suggest that QH formulation is a safe dietary supplement for amelioration of fatigue and for promoting exercise performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555950>Risk factors for nonalcoholic  disease after gastrectomy for gastric cancer.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) refers to hepatic steatosis caused by something other than alcoholic  injury, and often occurs after gastrointestinal surgeries such as pancreatoduodenectomy and gastrectomy. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for NAFLD after gastrectomy for gastric cancer.A total of 721 patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer and plane abdominal computed tomography (CT) preoperatively and 1 year after surgery were included in this study. NAFLD was defined as having a mean hepatic CT attenuation value of < 40 Hounsfield units. We retrospectively examined the relationship between the onset of NAFLD and clinicopathological findings to identify the risk factors associated with the development of NAFLD after gastrectomy.The incidence of postoperative NAFLD was 4.85% (35/721). The univariate analysis identified the following factors as being significantly associated with the incidence of NAFLD: age, preoperative BMI ≥ 25 kg/m, tumor depth of pT3 ≤, lymph node metastasis grade of pN2 ≤, cholecystectomy, D2 lymphadenectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy, high preoperative cholinesterase serum level, and low grade of preoperative FIB-4 index. Adjuvant chemotherapy (p < 0.001) and high preoperative cholinesterase serum level (p = 0.021) were identified as independent risk factors for NAFLD 1 year after gastrectomy.Our study showed that adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 and high level of serum cholinesterase were considered as the risk factors for NAFLD occurring after gastrectomy for gastric cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656991>Adiponectin and PPAR: a setup for intricate crosstalk between obesity and non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin, a soluble adipocytokine, plays an important role in the functioning of adipose tissue and in the regulation of inflammation, particularly hepatic inflammation.

However, there is scarce reporting on the onset of UC in patients with NAFLD. A 44-year-old man was diagnosed with UC and referred to us in 2019. His height was 166.0 cm, and body weight was 86.3 kg. The waist circumference was 93.7 cm (normal range <85) and triglyceride was 751 mg/dL. These findings, in addition to hypertension, resulted in a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. HbA1c was normal. Ultrasonography disclosed severe . Nonalcoholic  disease was diagnosed. He underwent 12 days of educational hospitalization for UC. A lacto-ovo-semi-vegetarian diet (1400 kcal/day), a kind of plant-based diet (PBD), was provided. He lost 4 kg, which was 4.6% of his base body weight. Triglyceride and total cholesterol decreased to the normal ranges. Transaminases and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase also decreased. His body weight decreased further after discharge. Follow-up ultrasonography indicated an improvement in hepatic enlargement. The shear wave velocity decreased from 1.11 to 0.88 m/s. His soft stool became normal stool by  months after discharge. Records of his health checkups revealed the presence of metabolic syndrome and abnormal  function tests already in 2015. Thus, it was concluded that UC developed in a patient with NAFLD in this case. Plant-based diet has already been shown to be effective in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the present case, NAFLD parameters were dramatically improved by PBD. Whether the improvement was due to weight loss per se or due to weight loss with PBD is to be clarified.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Considering the important role of dietary intakes in development of NAFLD, we aimed to determine possible association of unhealthy foods (fast foods, soft drinks, sweet and salty snacks) consumption with elevated levels of aminotransferases.This cross-sectional study was conducted within the framework of sixth phase of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (2014-2017), on 187 adult men and 249 adult women (19-70 y). Usual intakes of unhealthy foods (kcal/week) were measured using a validated semi-quantitative 147-items food frequency questionnaire. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of elevated aminotransferases in each tertile of energy-dense unhealthy foods.Mean age of participants was 44.44 ± 15.09 years, 43% of participants were men. Higher consumption of fast foods (> 11.39% kcal/week) was associated with elevated ALT to AST ratio (OR: 3.27; 95% CI: 1.90-5.63) and elevated ALT (OR: .74; 95% CI: 1.57-4.76).

In this study, we use arteriovenous measurement across the subcutaneous adipose tissue during a mixed meal challenge test to evaluate the performance and underlying assumptions of three existing models of adipose tissue metabolism and construct a new, refined model of adipose tissue metabolism. Our model introduces new terms, explicitly accounting for the conversion of glucose to glyceraldehye-3-phosphate, the postprandial influx of glycerol into the adipose tissue, and several physiologically relevant delays in insulin signalling in order to better describe the measured adipose tissues fluxes. We then applied our refined model to human adipose tissue flux data collected before and after a diet intervention as part of the Yoyo study, to quantify the effects of caloric restriction on postprandial adipose tissue metabolism. Significant increases were observed in the model parameters describing the rate of uptake and release of both glycerol and NEFA. Additionally, decreases in the model's delay in insulin signalling parameters indicates there is an improvement in adipose tissue insulin sensitivity following caloric restriction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618976>The Potential of the FSP1cre- Mouse Model for Studying Juvenile NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) can progress from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) characterized by  inflammation, possibly leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mice with impaired macrophage activation, when fed a high-fat diet, develop severe NASH. Evidence is mounting that Kupffer cells are implicated. However, it is unknown whether the resident CD68 or bone marrow-derived CD11b Kupffer cells are involved. Characterization of the FSP1cre-Pparb/d mouse  revealed that FSP1 is expressed in CD11b Kupffer cells. Although these cells only constitute a minute fraction of the  cell population,  deletion in these cells led to remarkable hepatic phenotypic changes. We report that a higher lipid content was present in postnatal day  (P2) FSP1cre- livers, which diminished after weaning. Quantification of total lipids and triglycerides revealed that P2 and week 4 of age FSP1cre- livers have higher levels of both. qPCR analysis also showed upregulation of genes involved in  acid β-oxidation, and  acid and triglyceride synthesis pathways. This result is further supported by western blot analysis of proteins in these pathways.

We hypothesized that a prenatal n-6 enriched diet will have adverse metabolic outcomes on the adult offspring that may be reversed with a postnatal n-3 enriched diet. To test this hypothesis, we examined the adult offspring from three groups: (1) n-6 group: during gestation and lactation, dams consumed an n-6 polyunsaturated  acid enriched diet, () n-3 group: gestational n-6 diet was followed by an n-3 enriched diet during lactation, and (3) a control (CD) group that received standard diet throughout gestation and lactation. Offspring from all groups weaned to a control diet ad libitum. Beginning at postnatal day  (P < .03) and persisting at 360 days in males (P < .04), an increase in hypothalamic AgRP expression occurred in the n-6 and n-3 groups, with an increase in food intake (P = .01), and the n-3 group displaying lower body (P < .03) and brain (P < .05) weights. At 360 days, the n-6 and n-3 groups remained glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive, with increased phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (P < .05). n-6 group developed hepatic steatosis with reduced hepatic reflected as higher plasma microRNA-122 (P < .04) that targets pAMPK. We conclude that early life exposure to n-6 and n-3 led to hypothalamic AgRP-related higher food intake, with n-6 culminating in a  partially mitigated by postnatal n-3.

Anthropometric measurements were obtained, serum  function tests and lipid and hormone profiles were measured, and prosteatogenic gene variants were genotyped using standard assays.In total, 41% of patients were women (mean age 60 ± 14.7 years, mean BMI 31. ± 4.6 kg/m). Hepatic steatosis, as defined by CAP > 248 dB/m, was present in 66% of patients. Five (45%) of the patients with hepatic steatosis also had fibrosis, and one presented with cirrhosis. Nine patients were carriers of the  p.I148M prosteatogenic [M] risk allele, eight of whom were heterozygotes. CAP values were significantly ( = .045) higher in these patients and corresponded to advanced steatosis, as compared to patients with the wild-type genotype, who demonstrated CAP values consistent with mild steatosis (311 ± 33 dB/m. vs 254 ± 62 dB/m). CAP values did not differ significantly in carriers of distinct  and  genotypes; however, carriers of the risk alleles displayed higher CAP as compared to wild-type patients.This study shows that in patients with acromegaly, carriers of the  susceptibility allele are at risk of developing hepatic steatosis, as assessed by CAP.

The present study was conducted to investigate transcriptomic responses in the  and jejunal mucosa of pigs to evaluate the effects of different feeding frequencies on the body's metabolism. Twelve Duroc × Landrance × Yorkshire growing pigs with an average initial weight (IW) of 14.86 ± 0.20 kg were randomly assigned to two groups: feeding one time per day (M1) and feeding two times per day (M2); each group consisted of six replicates (pens), with one pig per pen.

A subset of this population exhibits an aggressive histological phenotype, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with ≥ stage  fibrosis, which may progress to cirrhosis. The definition of NAFLD excludes excessive alcohol intake, which is well known to cause alcoholic  disease and will not be discussed here. Most NAFLD clinical trials use ~14 drinks per week as the cutoff for excessive alcohol intake. Alcohol consumption below this threshold, which we define as moderate alcohol consumption, is common in the US. According to the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 56% of the US adult population consume alcohol, but only 8.% report drinking heavily and 18.3% report binge drinking. The American Association for the Study of  Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidance of 2018 states that there are insufficient data to make a recommendation with regard to moderate alcohol consumption in patients with NAFLD, citing a lack of longitudinal studies that examine the impact of moderate alcohol consumption on disease progression and its extrahepatic harms versus benefits, specifically in individuals with established NAFLD. NAFLD prevalence studies have generally noted a negative correlation between modest alcohol consumption and NAFLD. However, prevalence studies have limited application to patients with established NAFLD who present to the clinic. There can also be many confounding factors, because modest alcohol consumption is also negatively associated with some NAFLD risk factors, and those risk factors may not be adequately adjusted for in analyses. The prevalence of NASH with significant fibrosis (≥ F2) is more important because this is the group that is believed to have progressive disease. Thus, cohort studies of disease progression are more important from the patient's standpoint. Because these patients have already developed NAFLD or NASH, their interest lies in their odds of disease progression if they have moderate alcohol consumption compared to abstinence. It is also noteworthy that cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of death among patients with NAFLD. Moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with a reduction in overall mortality, but mostly in cardiovascular mortality. However, this protective effect has not been demonstrated specifically in patients with NAFLD.2019 Translational Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and non-alcohol  disease.An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1.5 cm × .0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms.

Studies have indicated, however, that the onset of NAFLD occurs during pre-diabetes, a condition that often precedes the onset of T2DM. Oleanolic acid has been reported to improve glucose homeostasis in diet-induced pre-diabetes; however, the effects of this triterpene on  function have not been evaluated.This study was aimed at evaluating the therapeutic effects of oleanolic acid (OA) on selected markers of NAFLD in a pre-diabetes rat model.Pre-diabetes was induced by exposing Sprague Dawley rats to a high-fat high-carbohydrate diet for 20 weeks. The pre-diabetic rats were then treated with OA (80 mg/kg) or metformin (500 mg/kg) in the presence and absence of dietary interventions for a period of 12 weeks. The effects of OA were evaluated on parameters including plasma triglycerides (TGs), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, bilirubin, AST, ALT, SREBP and antioxidant profile while the livers were collected for histological analysis.The findings of this study showed that the administration of OA to pre-diabetic rats ameliorated body/ weights ratio and significantly decreased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and VLDL. Furthermore, OA also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress, lowered the SREBP expression and intrahepatic TGs. In addition, OA administration decreased plasma concentrations of bilirubin and  damage enzyme biomarkers.The findings of the study suggest that OA ameliorates the risk of developing pre-diabetes-related NAFLD through the prevention of intrahepatic fat accumulation while also lowering hepatic inflammation.© 2019 Gamede et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628409>Accuracy of proton magnetic resonance for diagnosing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a meta-analysis.</a></h2><p> biopsy is the reference standard test to differentiate between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and simple steatosis (SS) in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), but noninvasive diagnostics are warranted. The diagnostic accuracy in NASH using MR imaging modality have not yet been clearly identified. This study was assessed the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method for diagnosing NASH. Data were extracted from research articles obtained after a literature search from multiple electronic databases. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain overall effect size of the area under the receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios(LR), diagnostic odds ratio(DOR) of MRI method in detecting histopathologically-proven SS(or non-NASH) and NASH. Seven studies were analyzed 485 patients, which included 207 SS and 278 NASH. The pooled sensitivity was 87.4% (95% CI, 76.4-95.3) and specificity was 74.3% (95% CI, 62.4-84.6). Pooled positive LR was .59 (95% CI, 1.96-3.42) and negative LR was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.07-0.38). DOR was 21.57 (95% CI, 7.27-63.99). The area under the curve of summary ROC was 0.89.

Patients with  damage most often reported to internal medicine specialists (59%) and gastroenterologists (27.5%). The diagnosis was based on abnormal aminotransferases (80.8%) and abdominal ultrasound examination (89.9%). Computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (50.%) and  biopsy (22.4%) were used to assess fibrosis. Almost all respondents recommended reduction of body mass and lifestyle changes, and less than half (46.4%) recommended pharmacological treatment.NAFLD was the most common  disease that was the reason for medical consultations, but its incidence seems to be underestimated due to referral for further diagnostics only in patients with abnormal aminotransferases. The diagnostic methods used to assess the severity of the  fibrosis and the recommended pharmacological treatment varied depending on the physician's specialisation and the centre's reference level.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676775>Characterizing the Role of HMG-CoA Reductase in Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor-Mediated  Injury in C57BL/6 Mice.</a></h2><p>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor. The prototypical ligand of the AHR is an environmental contaminant called ,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD exposure is associated with many adverse health outcomes in humans including non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Previous studies suggest that AHR ligands alter cholesterol homeostasis in mice through repression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, such as Hmgcr, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis called 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). In this study, we sought to characterize the impact of HMGCR repression in TCDD-induced  injury. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to TCDD in the presence or absence of simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMGCR. Simvastatin exposure decreased TCDD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in both sexes, but was most prominent in females. Simvastatin and TCDD (S + T) co-treatment increased hepatic AHR-battery gene expression and  injury in male, but not female, mice. In addition, the S + T co-treatment led to an increase in hepatic glycogen content that coincides with heavier  in female mice. Results from this study suggest that statins, which are amongst the most prescribed pharmaceuticals, may protect from AHR-mediated steatosis, but alter glycogen metabolism and increase the risk of TCDD-elicited  damage in a sex-specific manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568518>Letrozole treatment of pubertal female mice results in activational effects on reproduction, metabolism and the gut microbiome.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in reproductive-aged women that is comprised of two out of the following three features: hyperandrogenism, oligo- or amenorrhea, or polycystic ovaries. In addition to infertility, many women with PCOS have metabolic dysregulation that increases the risk of developing type  diabetes, hypertension, and non-alcoholic  disease. Changes in the gut microbiome are associated with PCOS and gut microbes may be involved in the pathology of this disorder. Since PCOS often manifests in the early reproductive years, puberty is considered to be a critical time period for the development of PCOS. Exposure to sex steroid hormones during development results in permanent, organizational effects, while activational effects are transient and require the continued presence of the hormone. Androgens exert organizational effects during prenatal or early post-natal development, but it is unclear whether androgen excess results in organizational or activational effects during puberty. We recently developed a letrozole-induced PCOS mouse model that recapitulates both reproductive and metabolic phenotypes of PCOS. In this study, we investigated whether letrozole treatment of pubertal female mice exerts organizational or activational effects on host physiology and the gut microbiome. Two months after letrozole removal, we observed recovery of reproductive and metabolic parameters, as well as diversity and composition of the gut microbiome, indicating that letrozole treatment of female mice during puberty resulted in predominantly activational effects. These results suggest that if exposure to excess androgens during puberty leads to the development of PCOS, reduction of androgen levels during this time may improve reproductive and metabolic phenotypes in women with PCOS. These results also imply that continuous letrozole exposure is required to model PCOS in pubertal female mice since letrozole exerts activational rather than organizational effects during puberty.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651309>A predictive model for non-completion of an intensive specialist obesity service in a public hospital: a case-control study.</a></h2><p>Despite the growing evidence base supporting intensive lifestyle and medical treatments for severe obesity, patient engagement in specialist obesity services is difficult to achieve and poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to develop a model for predicting non-completion of a specialist multidisciplinary service for clinically severe obesity, termed the Metabolic Rehabilitation Programme (MRP).Using a case-control study design in a public hospital setting, we extracted data from medical records for all eligible patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥35 kg/m with either type  diabetes or  disease referred to the MRP from 2010 through 2015. Non-completion status (case definition) was coded for patients whom started but dropped-out of the MRP within 12 months. Using multivariable logistic regression, we tested the following baseline predictors hypothesised in previous research: age, gender, BMI, waist circumference, residential distance from the clinic, blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), current continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, current depression/anxiety, diabetes status, and medications. We used receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve to test the performance of models.Out of the 219 eligible patient records, 78 (35.6%) non-completion cases were identified. Significant differences between non-completers versus completers were: age (47.1 versus 54.5 years, p < 0.001); residential distance from the clinic (21.8 versus 17.1 km, p = 0.018); obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) (42.9% versus 56.7%, p = 0.050) and CPAP therapy (11.7% versus 28.4%, p = 0.005). The probability of non-completion could be independently associated with age, residential distance, and either OSA or CPAP. There was no statistically significant difference in performance between the alternate models (69.5% versus 66.4%, p = 0.57).Non-completion of intensive specialist obesity management services is most common among younger patients, with fewer complex care needs, and those living further away from the clinic. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risk factors for dropping out early when managing outpatients with severe obesity, whereas policy makers might consider strategies for increasing access to specialist obesity management services.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665641>Maternal Lipid Metabolism Directs Fetal  Programming following Nutrient Stress.</a></h2><p>The extreme metabolic demands of pregnancy require coordinated metabolic adaptations between mother and fetus to balance fetal growth and maternal health with nutrient availability. To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal  transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid metabolism alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal  transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient metabolism in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

High UA was defined as ≥ 75th percentile by sex in children and adolescents.The population was stratified in four categories: (1) normal eGFR and absence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD) (n = 1,236); () ReGFR and absence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD (n = 155); (3) normal eGFR and presence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD (n = 1019); (4) presence of both conditions (ReGFR/NAFLD) (n = 155). Proportions of youth with high UA across the four categories were 17%, 30%, 33% and 46%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Young people with high levels of UA had odds ratio (95% CI) of .11 (1.43-3.11) for ReGFR; .82 (.26-3.45) for NAFLD; and 5.04 (3.45-7.39) for both conditions (P < 0.0001 for all), independently of major confounders.High levels of UA were independently associated with ReGFR, NAFLD and the combination of both conditions in young people with OW/OB. The strength of this association was the highest in cases presenting both reduced eGFR and NAFLD.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis as the progressive disease entity often leads to fibrosis and end-stage disease. The magnitude of NAFLD patients are not diagnosed and have no access to further clinical assessment. Diagnostic pathways for individual risk evaluation fitting with available resources are of utmost importance in real-world clinical practice. Retrospective analysis of 1346 anonymized outpatient datasets at Würzburg University Hospital, Germany. Transient elastography (TE) with controlled attenuation parameter and laboratory-based risk scores (NFS, FIB-4) were the main diagnostic workup tools for risk stratification. After preselection based on questionnaire information NAFLD still accounts for one-fifth of patients in the  outpatient service. More than 80 % of NAFLD patients receive their first-time diagnosis in our unit. Laboratory-based risk scores and TE are valuable tools for second-step risk assessment as shown in our clinical data analysis. Moreover, 65 % of NAFLD patients use inpatient services for at least 1 day. The policy to perform  biopsy in high-risk patients above the recommended threshold of 9.6 kPa if any clinical doubt exists regarding the diagnosis of cirrhosis leads to a histological down staging in almost 80 %. Questionnaire-based referral from primary care followed by broadly available fast-track TE and eventually  biopsy for selected patients is the standard practice in our unit. This approach represents a feasible model to handle the large gap between availability and clinical need for TE facilities.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621956>Independent and combined effects of Satureja khuzistanica essential oils and acetic acid on prevalence and intensity of  syndrome in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Two hundred fifty two male Ross 308 broiler chicks were raised to examine the effects of Satureja khuzistanica essential oils (SkEO; 0, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 mg/bird/day) administrated via oral gavage and dietary supplementation of acetic acid (AA; 0 or 20 g/kg) in a 6 ×  factorial fashion using a complete randomized block design with seven replicates of three birds each. In Day 34 of age,  fat percentage decreased by increasing SkEO levels in a quadratic trend (p < .05). Oral gavag of 200 and 300 mg of SkEO decreased AST activity by 16.67% and 16.94%, respectively, compared with the control birds (p < .05). In Day 38 of age,  percentage was greater by 0.37% in the birds received 400 mg SkEO than those given 500 mg (p < .05).  fat percentage decreased in the birds fed the acidified diet and received 300 and 500 mg SkEO as well as in the birds offered 200 and 400 mg of SkEO and fed non-acidified diet than those received acidified diet with no SkEO administration (p < .05). Prevalence of score zero for hepatocytic vacuolations and necrosis was 80.00% and 42.42% in the birds receiving 600 mg SkEO respectively. Median for relative frequency of scores for hepatocytic vacuolations and hepatocytic necrosis was lesser in the birds received SkEO by oral gavage compared with that of control birds (p < .05). In conclusion, administration of SkEO via oral gavage reduced  fat in broiler chicken but no consistent dosage could be verified as the effective dosage for all ages concerned. The acidified diet per se showed no evident effect on  fat at all ages considered.

We examined whether  fibrosis, diagnosed by FibroScan , correlates with chronic vascular complications in a cohort of T2DM.We recruited 394 outpatients with T2DM attending five Italian diabetes centres who underwent  ultrasonography (US), FibroScan and extensive evaluation of macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications.Steatosis by US was present in 89%. Almost all patients (96%) were on hypoglycaemic drugs, 58% had at least one chronic vascular complication, 19% a macrovascular complication (prior myocardial infarction and/or ischaemic stroke) and 33% a microvascular one (26% chronic kidney disease [CKD]; 16% retinopathy; 6% neuropathy). In all, 171 (72%) patients had CAP ≥ 248dB/m (ie hepatic steatosis), whereas 83 (21%) patients had LSM ≥ 7.0/6. kPa (M/XL probes) (significant  fibrosis). CAP was not associated with any macro/microvascular complications, whereas LSM ≥ 7.0/6. kPa was independently associated with prior cardiovascular disease (adjusted OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.-8.8; P = .02) and presence of microvascular complications (adjusted OR 4., 95%CI 1.5-11.4; P = .005), mainly CKD (adjusted OR 3.6, 95%CI 1.3-10.1; P = .01) and retinopathy (adjusted OR 3.7, CI 95% 1.-11.9; P = .02). Neither diabetes duration nor haemoglobin A1c differed according to CAP or LSM values.Significant fibrosis, detected by FibroScan , is independently associated with increased prevalence of macrovascular and microvascular complications, thus opening a new scenario in the use of this tool for a comprehensive evaluation of hepatic and vascular complications in patients with T2DM.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Vitamin D may be a good therapeutic option for NAFLD patients due to its insulin sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties. The purpose is to investigate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on various parameters in NAFLD patients. In this double blind randomized placebo controlled trial, 109 patients of NAFLD diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound and  enzymes were divided into two groups for treatment with oral capsule of vitamin D3 50,000 IU and capsule placebo weekly for a period of 12 weeks. Anthropometric, chemical, metabolic and inflammatory parameters were assessed pre and post treatment by using SPSS 16. After 12 weeks oral treatment with vitamin D , its level increased significantly in vitamin D group from 12.5±4. to 24.5±3.8 ng/ml p =0.003 vs placebo group. This rise was further accompanied by decrease in HOMA-IR (4.56±1.6 to 3.26± 1.8 p=0.003)  enzymes (i.e. ALT: 72.±17.6 to 54.5±14.5 IU/L p=0.04; AST: 68±14.5 to 46.± 10.5 p =0.002) serum CRP 3.25±0.68 to .28±0.44 mg/L p =0.06 and increase in serum adiponectin 8.56 ±1.12 to 10.44±.35 mg/L p =0.03 as compared to placebo group. However non significant changes were observed in both groups in terms of body weight, BMI, and serum lipid profiles. Vitamin D supplementation not only improved its own status but also caused a significant amelioration in metabolic, chemical and inflammatory parameters in NAFLD patients.

Consecutive gout patients were recruited between August 2017 and December 2018. Demographic information, clinical characteristics and comorbidities were collected. BC was assessed by bioelectric impedance analysis including body fat percentage (BF%), trunk and limb BF%, appendicular skeletal muscle index. Overfat was defined by BF% ≥25% for male and ≥35% for female. The association between BC and serum uric acid (sUA) was evaluated by multiple linear regression.  A total of 362 gout patients were recruited with median age 38 (30, 52) years, 96.1% (348/362) were male. Mean sUA was (551±133) μmol/L. The mean BF% was (25.8±6.4)% with 53.6%(194/362) patients overfat. Male gout patients with overfat showed more affected joints [4(, 6) vs. (, 5)], higher sUA [(576±126)μmol/L vs. (523±134) μmol/L], higher prevalence of dyslipidemia [70.1%(131/187) vs. 54.0%(87/161)], metabolic syndrome [60.8%(118/187) vs. 28.0%(47/161)],  [58.%(113/187) vs. 35.1%(59/161)] and hypertension [44.4%(83/187) vs. 25.5%(41/161)] than male patients with normal fat (all <0.05). Their BF%, trunk BF% and limb BF% were positively correlated with the numbers of affected joints, sUA, metabolic syndrome, , and hypertension, respectively (=0.154-0.435, all <0.05). Multivariable linear regression suggested that BF% (=4.29, =0.020) and trunk BF% (=9.11, =0.007), but not limb BF%, were positively correlated with sUA.  Overfat is very common in gout patients. The proportion of trunk fat in male patients is positively correlated with sUA.

Iron metabolism is impaired in obese individuals and iron deficiency has been associated with physical inactivity. We investigated whether iron bioavailability is reduced in patients with NAFLD and contributes to reduced cardiorespiratory fitness.We collected information on weight-adjusted, submaximal physical work capacity (PWC), ultrasound-determined hepatic steatosis, iron indices, and hematologic and metabolic parameters from 390 female and 458 male participants of the Raine Study-a longitudinal study of disease development in 2868 children in Western Australia. X and linear regression analyses were used to compare characteristics of study participants according to NAFLD status at age 17 years.Fourteen percent of the cohort had NAFLD. PWC was significantly reduced in adolescents with NAFLD compared to adolescents without NAFLD (reduction of 0.17 W/kg, P=.0003, adjusted for sex and body mass index [BMI]). Iron bioavailability (assessed by mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH], transferrin saturation, and serum levels of iron) was inversely correlated with BMI in adolescents with NAFLD (P≤.01 for all, adjusted for sex) but not in adolescents without NAFLD (P>.30). MCV and MCH correlated with PWC (MCV, P=.002 for female and P=.0003 male participants; MCH, P=.004 for female and P=.01 for male participants), irrespective of NAFLD status. Reduced PWC was associated with lower transferrin saturation in adolescents with NAFLD (reduction of 0.012 W/kg per unit decrease in transferrin saturation, P=.007) but not in adolescents without NAFLD (reduction of 0.001 W/kg, P=.40), adjusted for sex. This association was independent of MCV or MCH.In a well-defined cohort of adolescents, we found NAFLD to be associated with decreased cardiorespiratory fitness, independent of BMI. The relationship between transferrin saturation and PWC in adolescents with NAFLD indicates that functional iron deficiency might contribute to reductions in cardiorespiratory fitness.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic  acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of  acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of  acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic  acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial  acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic  acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634989>Chemical constituents and synergistic anti-gout studies on Eurycoma longifolia and potential mechanisms evaluation based on systemic analysis approach.</a></h2><p>37 compounds mainly including triterpenoids with the quassinoid skeleton and β-carboline alkaloids have been isolated from the roots of Eurycoma longifolia Jack (EL), which has been used as traditional medicine for a long history.

However, the performance of noninvasive clinical models/scores and plasma biomarkers for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and advanced fibrosis has not been carefully assessed in patients with type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM).In this cross-sectional study, patients ( = 213) had a  MRS, and those with a diagnosis of NAFLD underwent a percutaneous  biopsy. Several noninvasive clinical models/scores and plasma biomarkers were measured to identify NASH and advanced fibrosis (NASH: alanine aminotransferase [ALT], cytokeratin-18, NashTest , HAIR, BARD, and OWLiver; advanced fibrosis: AST, fragments of propeptide of type III procollagen [PRO-C3], FIB-4, APRI, NAFLD fibrosis score, and FibroTest).None of the noninvasive tools assessed for the diagnosis of NASH in patients with T2DM had an optimum performance (all areas under the curve [AUCs] <0.80). Of note, none of the panels or biomarkers was able to outperform plasma ALT (AUC 0.78 [95% CI 0.71-0.84]). Performance was better to diagnose advanced fibrosis, in which plasma PRO-C3, AST, and APRI showed better results than the other approaches (AUC 0.90 [0.85-0.95]; 0.85 [0.80-0.91]; and 0.86 [0.80-0.91]; respectively). Again, none of the approaches did significantly better than plasma AST. Sequential use of plasma AST and other noninvasive tests may help in limiting the number of  biopsies required to detect patients with advanced fibrosis.Performance of noninvasive clinical models/scores and plasma biomarkers for the diagnosis of NASH or advanced fibrosis was suboptimal in patients with T2DM. Combination of multiple tests may provide an alternative to minimize the need of  biopsies to detect fibrosis in these patients.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632452>Hepatic PKA inhibition accelerates the lipid accumulation in .</a></h2><p> lipid accumulation induced by high-fat diet (HFD) is an early onset process of non-alcoholic  diseases (NAFLD). Protein kinase A (PKA) is known to be involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. However, the role of PKA in NAFLD has not been well tested in vivo due to the lack of optimal PKA deficient mouse model.A novel PKA-specific inhibitor gene was conditionally overexpressed in mouse (PKAi mouse)  using LoxP/Cre system. PKA activity in the  extract was measured with a commercial assay kit. The PKAi and control mice of 8-week age, were subjected to HFD or chow diet (CD) for  months. Body weight,  index, and triglyceride in the  were measured. RNA sequencing was performed for the  tissues and analyzed with Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment.PKAi-GFP protein was overexpressed in the  and the PKA activation was significantly inhibited in the  of PKAi mouse. When fed with CD, RNA sequencing revealed 56 up-regulated and 51 down-regulated genes in PKAi mice compared with control mice, which were mainly involved in lipid metabolism though no significant differences in the body weight,  index, triglyceride accumulation were observed between PKAi and control mice. However, when fed with HFD for  months, the  was enlarged more, and the accumulation of triglyceride in the  was more severe in PKAi mice. When comparing the transcriptomes of CD-fed and HFD-fed control mice, GO enrichment showed that the genes down-regulated by HFD were mainly enriched in immune-related GO terms, and up-regulated genes were enriched in metabolism. When comparing the transcriptomes of CD-fed and HFD-fed PKAi mice, GO analysis showed that the down-regulated genes were enriched in metabolism, while the up-regulated genes were clustered in ER stress-related pathways. When comparing HFD-fed PKAi and HFD-fed control mice, the genes with lower expression level in PKAi mice were enriched in the lipoprotein synthesis, which might explain that more TG is accumulated in PKAi  after HFD feeding.Reduced PKA activity could be a factor promoting the TG accumulation in the  and the development of NAFLD.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550253>A mitochondria-targeted  acid analogue influences hepatic glucose metabolism and reduces the plasma insulin/glucose ratio in male Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>A  acid analogue, -(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA), was previously shown to have hypolipidemic effects in rats by targeting mitochondrial activity predominantly in . This study aimed to determine if 1-triple TTA could influence carbohydrate metabolism. Male Wistar rats were treated for three weeks with oral supplementation of 100 mg/kg body weight 1-triple TTA. Blood glucose and insulin levels, and  carbohydrate metabolism gene expression and enzyme activities were determined. In addition, human myotubes and Huh7  cells were treated with 1-triple TTA, and glucose and  acid oxidation were determined. The level of plasma insulin was significantly reduced in 1-triple TTA-treated rats, resulting in a 32% reduction in the insulin/glucose ratio. The hepatic glucose and glycogen levels were lowered by 22% and 49%, respectively, compared to control. This was accompanied by lower hepatic gene expression of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, and Hnf4A, a regulator of gluconeogenesis. Gene expression of pyruvate kinase, catalysing the final step of glycolysis, was also reduced by 1-triple TTA. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was reduced, accompanied by 10-15-fold increased gene expression of its regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 compared to control, suggesting reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Indeed, the NADPH-generating enzyme malic enzyme 1 (ME1) catalysing production of pyruvate from malate, was increased 13-fold at the gene expression level. Despite the decreased glycogen level, genes involved in glycogen synthesis were not affected in livers of 1-triple TTA treated rats. In contrast, the pentose phosphate pathway seemed to be increased as the hepatic gene expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was higher in 1-triple TTA treated rats compared to controls. In human Huh7  cells, but not in myotubes, 1-triple-TTA reduced glucose oxidation and induced  acid oxidation, in line with previous observations of increased hepatic mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA oxidation in rats. Importantly, this work recognizes the  as an important organ in glucose homeostasis. The mitochondrially targeted  acid analogue 1-triple TTA seemed to lower hepatic glucose and glycogen levels by inhibition of gluconeogenesis. This was also linked to a reduction in glucose oxidation accompanied by reduced PHD activity and stimulation of ME1 and G6PD, favouring a shift from glucose- to  acid oxidation. The reduced plasma insulin/glucose ratio indicate that 1-triple TTA may improve glucose tolerance in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651873>Association between dietary iron intake and the prevalence of nonalcoholic  disease: A cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>The aim was to test the association between dietary iron intake and the prevalence of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in a large sample of middle-aged and elderly Chinese population.The data included in this analysis were collected from a population-based cross-sectional study, that is, the Xiangya Hospital Health Management Center Study. Dietary iron intake was assessed using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. The relationship between dietary iron intake and the prevalence of NAFLD was examined using logistic and spline regressions.A cross-sectional study including 5445 subjects was conducted. The prevalence of NAFLD was 36.9%. Compared with the lowest quintile, the energy-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of NAFLD were 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.64), 1.80 (95% CI: 1.41-.29) and .11 (95% CI: 1.60-.80) in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th quintile of iron intake, respectively (P-value for trend <.001). In addition, dietary iron intake was positively associated with the OR of NAFLD in a dose-response relationship manner (test for trend P < .001). However, after stratifying the data by gender, such association only remained in the male, but not in the female population. With adjustment of additional potential confounders, the results did not change materially.Subjects with higher dietary iron intake were subject to a higher prevalence of NAFLD in a dose-response relationship manner. However, such association probably only exists in males, but not in females.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661783>A Lipidomic Analysis of Docosahexaenoic Acid (22:6, ω3) Mediated Attenuation of Western Diet Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Male  Mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem worldwide. NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Obesity and type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated  acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated  acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C ω3 PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559105>Overview of studies of the vitamin D/vitamin D receptor system in the development of non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic  disease in the world. NAFLD is known to be associated with obesity, type  diabetes, metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular events: for these reasons, it is becoming a global public health problem and represents an important challenge in terms of prevention and treatment. The mechanisms behind the pathogenesis of NAFLD are multiple and have not yet been completely unraveled; consequently, at moment there are not effective treatments. In the past few years a large body of evidence has been assembled that attributes an important role in hepatic aberrant fat accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis, to the vitamin D/vitamin D receptor (VD/VDR) axis, showing a strong association between hypovitaminosis D and the diagnosis of NAFLD. However, the data currently available, including clinical trials with VD supplementation, still provides a contrasting picture. The purpose of this editorial is to provide an overview of recent advances in the pathogenesis of NAFLD in relation to VD/VDR. Based on recent data from literature, we focused in particular on the hypothesis that VDR itself, independently from its traditional ligand VD, may have a crucial function in promoting hepatic fat accumulation. This might also offer new possibilities for future innovative therapeutic approaches in the management of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637670>What Is the Role of the New Index Relative Fat Mass (RFM) in the Assessment of Nonalcoholic  Disease (NAFLD)?</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the  manifestation of adiposopathy. Recently, a new score was developed to estimate body fat percentage (relative fat mass, RFM). We aimed to evaluate the value of RFM in predicting the presence and severity of NAFLD, compared with other anthropometric measurements.RFM, body mass index (BMI), and other anthropometric measurements were evaluated in two cohorts of subjects: a cohort from a Portuguese prospective epidemiological study (e_Cor) and morbidly obese patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. We evaluated if RFM and BMI were related with the presence and severity of  disease, which was assessed by noninvasive tools in the first cohort and by  histology in the morbidly obese cohort. The independence of relations found in univariate analysis was assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis.In the general population cohort, 744 subjects (48% male) were enrolled. BMI-defined obesity was present in 23% and RFM-defined obesity in 86%. Insulin resistance (IR) related with BMI-defined obesity (OR 4.37 [.16-8.84]) and weight (OR 1.05 [1.02-1.08]) in men, and waist circumference (WC) (OR 1.07 [1.03-1.11]) in women. Dyslipidemia and hypertension related with RFM-defined obesity in men (OR .96 [1.36-6.47] and OR 5.37 [1.31-22.06], respectively). Ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD in 33% related with weight in men (OR 1.03 [1.003-1.06] and WC in women (OR 1.06 [1.02-1.10]). In men, ALT elevation related with weight (OR 1.04 [1.02-1.07]). In women, advanced fibrosis (estimated by NAFLD Fibrosis Score) associated with BMI-defined obesity (OR 42.43 [3.61-498.13]). In the morbidly obese cohort, 152 subjects were enrolled, of whom 84% were female, 37% had steatohepatitis, and 9.4% had advanced fibrosis. Adiponectin associated inversely and leptin positively with RFM in men. The severity of steatosis increased linearly with BMI and WC in women. Higher BMI associated with steatohepatitis in women and advanced fibrosis in men.RFM-defined obesity better predicted dyslipidemia and hypertension (though not IR) and adipokine imbalance; however, it did not add value to BMI-defined obesity in predicting NAFLD or  injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589126>Etiological features of  involvement in rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p> involvement is not considered a typical extra-articular manifestation and has rarely been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).We aimed to identify the prevalence and the aetiologies of  disease in RA patients.A cross-sectional study included 150 patients with RA enrolled over a 5-year period (2010-2015). The clinical and paraclinical features of RA were analysed. The clinical and biological characteristics of  impairment and its aetiologies were collected.One hundred fifty RA patients (124 women) with a mean age of 57.09 years and a mean RA duration of 7.52 years were included.  involvement was diagnosed in 66 patients (44%). The  disease was asymptomatic in 94% of cases, revealed by increased gamma glutamyl transferase levels in 74% of patients. The aetiologies of  involvement were hepatotoxicity of medications in 38 cases (57%), hepatitis B and C in 14 patients (21%),  disease in 10 cases (15%), autoimmune  disease in  patients (3%), hydatid cyst in 1 case (%), and  angiomas in 1 case (%). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and methotrexate were the drugs most often involved in the genesis of hepatotoxicity (21% and 20% of cases, respectively). involvement occurred in 44% of RA patients.

Evidence is accumulating that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) act as a new class of endocrine factor. These miRNAs are released by many types of tissue, including adipose tissues. miRNAs might serve as endocrine and paracrine messengers that facilitate communication between donor cells and tissues with receptor cells or target tissues, thereby potentially having important roles in metabolic organ crosstalk. Moreover, many miRNAs are closely associated with the differentiation of adipocytes and are dysregulated in obesity. As such, circulating miRNAs are attractive potential biomarkers and hold promise for the development of miRNA-based therapeutics (such as miRNA mimetics, anti-miRNA oligonucleotides and exosomes loaded with miRNA) for obesity and related disorders. Here we review the latest research progress on the roles of circulating miRNAs in metabolic organ crosstalk. In addition, we discuss the clinical potential of circulating miRNAs as feasible biomarkers for the assessment of future risk of metabolic disorders and as therapeutic targets in obesity and related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607566>L-carnitine supplementation attenuates NAFLD progression and cardiac dysfunction in a mouse model fed with methionine and choline-deficient diet.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of chronic  disorder. NAFLD, associated lipotoxicity, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and altered mitochondrial metabolism, is responsible for systemic inflammation, which contributes to organ dysfunction in extrahepatic tissues, including the heart. We investigated the ability of L-carnitine (LC) to oppose the pathogenic mechanisms underlying NAFLD progression and associated heart dysfunction, in a mouse model of methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCDD). Mice were divided into three groups: namely, the control group (CONTR) fed with a regular diet and two groups fed with MCDD for 6 weeks. In the last 3 weeks, one of the MCDD groups received LC (200 mg/kg each day) through drinking water (MCDD + LC). The hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative stress decreased after LC supplementation, which also reduced hepatic fibrosis via modulation of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), peroxisome-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and nuclear factor kappa B (NfƙB) expression. LC ameliorated systemic inflammation, mitigated cardiac reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and prevented fibrosis progression by acting on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1- (ERK1-), and αSMA. This study confirms the existence of a relationship between  disease and cardiac abnormalities and highlights the role of LC in controlling  oxidative stress, steatosis, fibrosis, and NAFLD-associated cardiac dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Thus, determining the prevalence and the population risk factors of steatosis may assist in risk stratification. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of steatosis and steatohepatitis among livers from adults who died due to non-burn trauma.Specimens were collected from 224 adults undergoing autopsy at a regional autopsy referral center from September 2011 to April 2013. Histopathological examination was performed on six samples obtained from different lobes of each . The outcomes of interest were the presence of steatosis, steatohepatitis, NASH inflammation and NASH fibrosis. The main predictors were body mass index, abdominal circumference,  weight and volume, presence of cholelithiasis, and siderosis. Our modeling strategy made use of a series of generalized linear models with a binomial family.Our sample had a mean age of 40 years; steatosis was diagnosed in 48.% of cases, and steatohepatitis was diagnosed in .7%. The presence of a high proportion of  changes was more prevalent among males and older individuals, with the most affected age group being 41-60 years. When evaluating the crude odds ratio for steatosis, the factors significantly associated with an increased risk of steatosis were greater abdominal circumference, BMI, and  weight and the presence of siderosis.Our study reinforces the role of older age, obesity and hepatomegaly as predictors of  disease.

Infertile Afrocaribbean (AC) women with PCOS may have metabolic features that could help to better target their management.  To evaluate the characteristics of PCOS in this population and their metabolic profile to target the worst metabolic parameter.  A retrospective study including infertile AC women for 4 years. PCOS was diagnosed using Rotterdam criteria and compared with non-PCOS women referred consecutively for infertility during the same period.  Among 981 AC women evaluated for infertility, PCOS was found in 17%. PCOS women were younger than non-PCOS women. After age and body mass index (BMI) matching, only fasting blood glucose and triglyceride levels were higher in PCOS women compared with non-PCOS women. PCOS was positively correlated with triglyceride levels and negatively with vitamin D levels. PCOS women with obesity had low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and increased triglyceride levels compared with those without obesity. No correlation was found between lipids or glucose levels and androgen levels. Multivariate analysis showed that only triglycerides were independently related to PCOS after adjustment for age and BMI.  In the AC population where the prevalence of obesity and diabetes is increased, the metabolic profile of infertile women with PCOS is mainly characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, with a higher risk of visceral obesity and nonalcoholic  disease. Interventional studies would be useful to evaluate the predictive value of hypertriglyceridemia on diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in this population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616668>Cardiovascular Risk in  Disease: The -Heart Axis-Literature Review.</a></h2><p>According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 18 million deaths per year. Nevertheless, the worldwide prevalence of metabolic diseases, such as type  diabetes mellitus, obesity, and non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), also known to be common risk factors for CVD, have dramatically increased over the last decades. Chronic alcohol consumption is a major cause of chronic  diseases (CLD) as well as being a major health care cost expenditure accounting for the spending of tremendous amounts of money annually. NAFLD has become one of the major diseases plaguing the world while standing as the most common cause of  disease in the Western countries by representing about 75% of all CLD. Currently, the most common cause of death in NAFLD remains to be CVD. Several mechanisms have been suggested to be responsible for associating FLD with CVD through several mechanisms including low-grade systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, adipokines, endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipotoxicity and microbiota dysbiosis which may also be influenced by other factors such as genetic and epigenetic variations. Despite of all this evidence, the exact mechanisms of how FLD can causally contribute to CVD are not fully elucidated and much remains unknown. Moreover, the current literature supports the increasing evidence associating FLD with several cardiovascular (CV) adverse events including coronary artery disease, increased subclinical atherosclerosis risk, structural alterations mainly left ventricular hypertrophy, increased epicardial fat thickness, valvular calcifications including aortic valve sclerosis and mitral annular calcification and functional cardiac modifications mainly diastolic dysfunction in addition to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrythmias and conduction defects including atrioventricular blocks and bundle branch blocks. Patients with FLD should be evaluated and managed accordingly in order to prevent further complications. Possible management methods include non-pharmacological strategies including life style modifications, pharmacological therapies as well as surgical management. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms linking FLD with an increased CV risk, in addition to associated CV adverse events and current management modalities.Copyright © 2019 Ismaiel and Dumitraşcu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600750>Rodent Models of Nonalcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a continuous diseases spectrum associated with obesity, type  diabetes, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. Simple hepatic steatosis may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), even fibrosis and cirrhosis, and finally hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, NAFLD has become a public health concern with increasing prevalence. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis remain incompletely understood, and few effective therapeutic approaches are available. Summary and Key Messages: A myriad of different rodent models has been developed to elucidate pathophysiology of NAFLD/NASH and guide therapeutic strategy. To date, no single rodent model can display the whole disease spectrum and metabolic features associated with human NASH, but can imitate particular characteristics. In this paper, we review the most commonly used dietary, genetic, and chemical rodent models for NAFLD referring to their advantages and disadvantages. Also, we illustrate the status of latest treatment strategy using various NAFLD rodent models. We hope to provide critical guidance for researchers to select appropriate animal models.© 2019 S.

Attachment of ligand to the PPAR-γ receptor activates a series of genes that are involved in glucose and  acid metabolism, the overall effect being an increase in insulin effect. The thiazolidinediones reduce blood glucose levels in patients with type  diabetes and act additively with other antidiabetic medications. Troglitazone was the first thiazolidinedione that received approval for use in the United States (January 1997). However, within a year of its approval, reports of severe  injury and deaths from acute  failure began to appear. Cautionary statements and recommendations for monitoring of ALT levels were made, but after more than two dozen reports of hepatic failure and the introduction of two new thiazolidinediones in 1999, troglitazone was withdrawn from use in 2000. The newer thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have been associated with only rare instances of acute  injury. Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are linked to increased weight gain, heart failure and fracture risk and they are considered second-line agents for type  diabetes and recommended only after failure of metformin and lifestyle modifications.

We compared real-life healthcare costs of patients with NAFLD to matched controls.We performed a retrospective study of 646 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD in Sweden from 1971 through 2009. Each patient was matched for age, sex, and county of residence with 10 persons from the general population (controls). We retrieved all healthcare contacts through Dec 31, 2014 from national registers. Unit costs were assigned to arrive at a total healthcare cost (in USD [$]) per study subject.During a mean follow-up of 19.9 years, we recorded a mean of 0.27 hospitalizations per year for patients with NAFLD vs 0.16 for controls (P<.001). This corresponded to an incremental cost of $635 per year for patients with NAFLD. Patients with NAFLD had a higher mean use of outpatient care visits: 1.46 contacts per year compared with 0.86 per year in controls, corresponding to $255 in additional costs (P<.001). Total costs incurred by patients with stage 3-4 fibrosis were higher than by patients with fibrosis stage 0- (mean annual costs, $4397 vs $629). Cumulative costs were higher for all stages of fibrosis compared to controls.Healthcare costs are nearly twice as high in patients with NAFLD than in matched controls. This is mostly attributable to higher costs for hospitalizations, but also to more outpatient visits. Patients with advanced fibrosis had the highest costs.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose insulin sensitivity index [OGIS]). The  insulin resistance index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including fat mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to fat mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001),  insulin resistance (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance ( h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in insulin sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and insulin sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals. These results support the role of palmitoleate as a beneficial lipokine released by adipose tissue to prevent the negative effects of adiposity and excess NEFA on systemic glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652406>The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid in rats with orotic acid-induced non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Post-transplantation non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is common in  transplant recipients.

NAFLD was induced by feeding a diet containing 1% (w/w) orotic acid for 20 days. The extent of hepatic glucuronidation of MPA to a major metabolite, mycophenolic acid-7-O-glucuronide (MPAG), did not differ between rats with NAFLD and controls. The expression levels of hepatic multidrug resistance-associated protein , responsible for biliary excretion of MPAG, were comparable in rats with NAFLD and controls; the biliary excretion of MPAG was also similar in the two groups. Compared with control rats, rats with NAFLD did not exhibit significant changes in the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves of MPA or MPAG after intravenous (5 mg/kg) or oral (10 mg/kg) administration of MPA.

Diabetes was 0% in no-NAFLD, 13% in SS, 35% in NASH. During OGTT, OGIS decreased from A to C (422 vs 360 vs 338, p < 0.01). Increased insulin concentrations, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and OGIS, not Hep-IR, were strongly associated to hepatic steatosis (p = 0.03, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 respectively). Hepatic fibrosis stage was mild as most of the patients had fibrosis grade-1 (69% vs. 8% no fibrosis) and associated to fasting insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR. dAUC-I/dAUC-G was similar in the 3 groups, while only AUC-I was strongly associated to steatosis (r = 0.35, p = 0.005), but not to fibrosis.In morbid obesity indexes of IR, and not of insulin response, are markers of histological severity of  disease.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

This study quantified  fat improvement by orlistat in a Chinese cohort with NAFLD accompanied by obesity, diagnosed by a lower body mass index threshold than that for White patients.We conducted a parallel-group, open-label, 24-week, randomized clinical trial registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IPR-17012258). Obese participants with NAFLD were randomized 1:1.5 to the intervention group with orlistat or conventional care.  fat quantification was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging-based proton density fat fraction with Dixon sequence.Overall, 170 ( = 68, orlistat 120 mg three times/day and  = 102, conventional therapy) and 130 patients with NAFLD ( = 56, orlistat and  = 74, conventional therapy) were included for intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis, respectively. Orlistat reduced  fat content to a greater degree than conventional care [-5.45%  -1.96%,  < 0.001 (ITT analysis) and -6.66%  -.68%,  < 0.001 (PP analysis)]. The 6-month rate of decrease in steatosis grades was higher in the orlistat group [45.6%  22.5% (ITT analysis), 57.4%  30.3% (PP analysis), both  < 0.001]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified orlistat treatment [odds ratio (OR) = .4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-5.6,  = 0.036] as an independent predictor of steatosis improvement. Among patients with orlistat therapy, weight loss (OR = 1., 95% CI 1.1-1.4,  = 0.040) and severe steatosis (OR = 6.7, 95% CI: 1.1-40.3,  = 0.03) remained predictive of steatosis improvement.Orlistat can effectively promote steatosis improvement and may serve as a treatment option for controlling NAFLD.ChiCTR-IPR-17012258.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614690>Exploration and Development of PPAR Modulators in Health and Disease: An Update of Clinical Evidence.</a></h2><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors that govern the expression of genes responsible for energy metabolism, cellular development, and differentiation. Their crucial biological roles dictate the significance of PPAR-targeting synthetic ligands in medical research and drug discovery. Clinical implications of PPAR agonists span across a wide range of health conditions, including metabolic diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, infections, autoimmune diseases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and malignancies. In this review we aim to consolidate existing clinical evidence of PPAR modulators, highlighting their clinical prospects and challenges. Findings from clinical trials revealed that different agonists of the same PPAR subtype could present different safety profiles and clinical outcomes in a disease-dependent manner. Pemafibrate, due to its high selectivity, is likely to replace other PPARα agonists for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. PPARγ agonist pioglitazone showed tremendous promises in many non-metabolic disorders like chronic kidney disease, depression, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The clinical niche of PPARβ/δ agonists is less well-explored. Interestingly, dual- or pan-PPAR agonists, namely chiglitazar, saroglitazar, elafibranor, and lanifibranor, are gaining momentum with their optimistic outcomes in many diseases including type  diabetes, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic  disease, and primary biliary cholangitis. Notably, the preclinical and clinical development for PPAR antagonists remains unacceptably deficient. We anticipate the future design of better PPAR modulators with minimal off-target effects, high selectivity, superior bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics. This will open new possibilities for PPAR ligands in medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639886>Non-invasive monitoring of hepatic steatosis via acoustic structure quantification of ultrasonography with MR spectroscopy as the reference standard.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate whether monitoring hepatic steatosis by ultrasonography with acoustic structure quantification (ASQ) is feasible, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as the reference standard.Thirty-six patients with suspected  disease underwent both untrasonography with ASQ and MRS on the same day. After a mean follow-up period of 11.4±.5 months, follow-up ultrasonography with ASQ and MRS were performed on 27 patients to evaluate whether hepatic steatosis had improved. The focal disturbance (FD) ratio, as calculated using ASQ, and the hepatic fat fraction (HFF), estimated by MRS, were obtained at both initial and follow-up examinations. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the correlations between ordinal values.The FD ratio showed a strong, negative linear correlation with the HFF after logarithmic transformation of both variables from the initial examinations of 36 patients (ρ=-0.888, P<0.001) and the follow-up examinations of 27 patients (ρ=-0.920, P<0.001). There was also a significant, negative linear correlation between the change in the logarithm of the FD ratio and the change in the logarithm of the HFF by MRS over the follow-up period (ρ=-0.645, P<0.001). In 16 patients with an increased FD ratio on follow-up, the HFF on follow-up MRS significantly decreased, and high-density lipoprotein levels significantly increased, whereas low-density lipoprotein levels tended to decrease.The FD ratio was significantly correlated with the HFF at both the initial and follow-up examinations, and there was also a significant correlation between changes in the FD ratio and changes in the HFF over the follow-up period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665653>Enrichment of brain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is highly dependent upon the molecular carrier of dietary DHA: lysophosphatidylcholine is more efficient than either phosphatidylcholine or triacylglycerol.</a></h2><p>Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is highly concentrated in the brain, and its deficiency is associated with several neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease. However, the currently used supplements do not appreciably enrich brain DHA, although they enrich most other tissues. We tested the hypothesis that the ability of the dietary carrier to augment brain DHA depends upon the generation of DHA-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), the preferred carrier of DHA across the blood brain barrier. We compared the efficacy of DHA-triacylglycerol (TAG), di-DHA phosphatidylcholine (PC) and DHA-LPC to enrich brain DHA following their gavage to normal rats for 30 days, all at a dose of 10 mg DHA/day. The results show that DHA from TAG, which is released as free DHA or monoacylglycerol during digestion and is absorbed as TAG in chylomicrons, was incorporated preferentially into adipose tissue and heart but not into brain. In contrast, LPC-DHA increased brain DHA by up to 100% but had no effect on adipose tissue. Di-DHA PC, which generates both free DHA and LPC-DHA during the digestion, enriched DHA in brain, as well as in heart and . Brain-derived neurotrophic factor was increased by di-DHA PC and DHA-LPC, but not by TAG-DHA, showing that enrichment of brain DHA correlated with its functional effect. We conclude that dietary DHA from TAG or from natural PC (sn- position) is not suitable for brain enrichment, whereas DHA from LPC (at either sn-1 or sn- position) or from sn-1 position of PC efficiently enriches the brain and is functionally effective.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670060>Hepatoprotective potential of 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone against alcohol and high-fat diet induced  toxicity via attenuation of oxido-nitrosative stress and NF-κB activation.</a></h2><p> diseases are the most common and major health concern arises from the modern lifestyle and alcohol (ethanol) abuse. The prevalence of non-alcoholic  diseases (NAFLD) has been observed prominently in obese and diabetic individuals, while alcoholic  disease is common in alcoholic persons.  disease, such as steatohepatitis, leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) against high-fat diet (HFD) and ethanol (EtOH)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Male Wistar rats (150-200 g) were fed HFD (58% calories from fat) and EtOH (3-15% in drinking water) for 12 weeks. 7,8-DHF was administered intraperitoneally at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day for the last four weeks. After 12 weeks, biochemical, ELISA, RT-PCR, and histological studies have been carried out.Biochemical analyses revealed the involvement of oxidative stress and inflammation in the  of HFD and EtOH-fed rats. 7,8-DHF treatment significantly reduced HFD and EtOH-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by the reduction of lipid peroxidation and augmentation of reduced glutathione level. Moreover, IL-1β level was found significantly reduced in 7,8-DHF treated EtOH, HFD and EtOH+HFD groups. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR results indicated down-regulation of Nrf- and HO-1 and up-regulation of NF-κB and iNOS mRNA expression level in the  of HFD and EtOH-fed rats, which was ameliorated by 7,8-DHF treatment.The present study suggested that 7,8-DHF could be an effective pharmacological intervention in combating HFD and EtOH-induced hepatotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Recently, we discovered that DNAs targeting microRNA-22-3p (miR-22-3p) hold the potential for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders (type  diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD)) by turning fat-storing white adipocytes into fat-burning adipocytes. In this work, we explored the effects of chemical modifications, including phosphorothioate (PS), locked nucleic acid (LNA), and peptide nucleic acid (PNA), on the structure and energy of DNA analogs by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To achieve a reliable prediction of the hybridization free energy, the AMOEBA polarizable force field and the free energy perturbation technique were employed. The calculated hybridization free energies are generally compatible with previous experiments. For LNA and PNA, the enhanced duplex stability can be explained by the preorganization mechanism, i.e., the single strands adopt stable helical structures similar to those in the duplex. For PS, the S and R isomers (Sp and Rp) have preferences for C2'-endo and C3'-endo sugar puckering conformations, respectively, and therefore Sp is less stable than Rp in DNA/RNA hybrids. In addition, the solvation penalty of Rp accounts for its destabilization effect. PS-LNA is similar to LNA as the sugar puckering is dominated by the locked sugar ring. This work demonstrated that MD simulations with polarizable force fields are useful for the understanding and design of modified nucleic acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662868>Evaluation and comparison of six noninvasive tests for prediction of significant or advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>In nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD), advanced fibrosis has been identified as an important prognostic factor with increased -related mortality and treatment need. Due to the high prevalence of NAFLD, noninvasive risk stratification is needed to select patients for  biopsy and treatment.To compare the diagnostic accuracy of several widely available noninvasive tests for assessment of fibrosis among patients with NAFLD with or without nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).We enrolled consecutive patients with NAFLD admitted to two Austrian referral centers who underwent  biopsy.  stiffness measurement (LSM) was obtained by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE, FibroScan) and blood samples were collected for determination of enhanced  fibrosis (ELF) test, FibroMeter, FibroMeter, NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4).Our study cohort contained 186 patients with histologically confirmed NAFLD. On  histology, NASH was present in 92 patients (50%), significant fibrosis (F ≥ ) in 71 patients (38%), advanced fibrosis (F ≥ 3) in 49 patients (26%), and F ≥ 3 plus NASH in 35 patients (19%). For diagnosis of F ≥ , F ≥ 3, and F ≥ 3 plus NASH, respectively, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed superior diagnostic accuracy of ELF score (area under ROC curve (AUROC) 0.85, 0.90, 0.90), FibroMeter (AUROC 0.86, 0.88, 0.89), FibroMeter (AUROC 0.84, 0.88, 0.88), and LSM per protocol (AUROC 0.87, 0.95, 0.91) versus FIB-4 (AUROC 0.80, 0.82, 0.81) or NFS (AUROC 0.78, 0.80, 0.79).Proprietary fibrosis panels and VCTE show superior diagnostic accuracy for noninvasive diagnosis of fibrosis stage in NAFLD as compared to FIB-4 and NFS.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614732>Sp1 is Involved in Vertebrate LC-PUFA Biosynthesis by Upregulating the Expression of  Desaturase and Elongase Genes.</a></h2><p>The rabbitfish  was the first marine teleost demonstrated to have the ability for the biosynthesis of long-chain (≥C20) polyunsaturated  acids (LC-PUFA) from C18 PUFA precursors, and all the catalytic enzymes including two  acyl desaturase  (Δ4 Fads2 and Δ6/Δ5 Fads2) and two elongases (Elovl4 and Elovl5) have been identified, providing a good model for studying the regulatory mechanisms of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in fish. Stimulatory protein 1 (Sp1) has been speculated to be a vital transcription factor in determining the promoter activity of Fads-like genes in fish, however its regulatory effects on gene expression and LC-PUFA biosynthesis have not been demonstrated. Bioinformatic analysis predicted potential Sp1 binding sites in the promoters of the rabbitfish Δ6/Δ5  and , but not in Δ4  promoter. Here we cloned full-length cDNA of the rabbitfish  gene, which encoded a putative protein of 701 amino acids, and was expressed in all tissues studied with highest levels in gill and eyes. The dual luciferase reporter assay in HepG2 line cells demonstrated the importance of the Sp1 binding site for the promoter activities of both Δ6/Δ5  and . Moreover, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed the direct interaction of Sp1 with the two promoters. Insertion of the Sp1 binding site of Δ6/Δ5  promoter into the corresponding region of the Δ4  promoter significantly increased activity of the latter. In the  hepatocyte line (SCHL) cells, mRNA levels of Δ6/Δ5  and  were positively correlated with the expression of  when  was overexpressed or knocked-down by RNAi or antagonist (mithramycin) treatment.

These results indicated that Sp1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis by directly targeting Δ6/Δ5  and  in rabbitfish, which is the first report of Sp1 involvement in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in vertebrates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672448>Effects of newer antidiabetic drugs on nonalcoholic  and steatohepatitis: Think out of the box!</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic  disease in Western societies and a major cause of hepatic disease worldwide. Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD, and especially NASH, are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) predisposes to NAFLD development and progression via insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter  inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed. Taking into consideration the global increasing prevalence of NAFLD/NASH, therapeutic options that can prevent or treat this disease will exert considerable benefits on human health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The ratio of circulating conjugated chenodeoxycholic acids to muricholic acids (P = 0.001) was elevated from healthy controls to non-NASH individuals to NASH individuals in a stepwise manner in the training cohort and was positively associated with the histological severity of NASH: steatosis (R  = 0.12), lobular inflammation (R  = 0.12), ballooning (R  = 0.11), and fibrosis stage (R  = 0.18). The ratio was elevated in the validation cohort of NASH patients (P < 0.001), and it was able to predict NASH (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 75%) and significant fibrosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 71%) in these two cohorts.

We examined dietary factors in relation to NAFLD risk in African Americans, Japanese Americans, Latinos, Native Hawaiians, and whites in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC). A nested case-control analysis was conducted within the MEC, a large prospective study with >215,000 older-adult participants in Hawaii and California. NAFLD was identified using Medicare claims data, and controls were selected among participants without  disease and individually matched to cases by birth year, sex, ethnicity, and length of Medicare enrollment. Diet was assessed at baseline via a validated quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Diet-NAFLD associations were quantified by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable conditional logistic regression. The study consisted of ,974 NAFLD cases (518 with cirrhosis; ,456 without cirrhosis) and 29,474 matched controls. Red meat (P trend=0.010), processed red meat (P trend= 0.004), poultry (P trend= 0.005) and cholesterol (P trend= 0.005) intakes were positively associated with NAFLD, while dietary fiber intake (P trend=0.003) was inversely associated with risk. Stronger associations were observed between red meat and cholesterol and NAFLD with cirrhosis than without cirrhosis (P heterogeneity ≤0.014). Conclusion Dietary factors are independently associated with NAFLD and NAFLD-related cirrhosis in a multiethnic population. Decreasing the consumption of cholesterol, red and processed meat and poultry and increasing consumption of fiber may reduce the risk for NAFLD and related advanced  disease.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592078>Development of a Plasma Screening Panel for Pediatric Nonalcoholic  Disease Using Metabolomics.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic  disease in children, but diagnosis is challenging due to limited availability of noninvasive biomarkers. Machine learning applied to high-resolution metabolomics and clinical phenotype data offers a novel framework for developing a NAFLD screening panel in youth. Here, untargeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed on plasma samples from a combined cross-sectional sample of children and adolescents ages -25 years old with NAFLD (n = 222) and without NAFLD (n = 337), confirmed by  biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging. Anthropometrics, blood lipids,  enzymes, and glucose and insulin metabolism were also assessed. A machine learning approach was applied to the metabolomics and clinical phenotype data sets, which were split into training and test sets, and included dimension reduction, feature selection, and classification model development. The selected metabolite features were the amino acids serine, leucine/isoleucine, and tryptophan; three putatively annotated compounds (dihydrothymine and two phospholipids); and two unknowns. The selected clinical phenotype variables were waist circumference, whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI) based on the oral glucose tolerance test, and blood triglycerides. The highest performing classification model was random forest, which had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94, sensitivity of 73%, and specificity of 97% for detecting NAFLD cases. A second classification model was developed using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance substituted for the WBISI. Similarly, the highest performing classification model was random forest, which had an AUROC of 0.92, sensitivity of 73%, and specificity of 94%.  The identified screening panel consisting of both metabolomics and clinical features has promising potential for screening for NAFLD in youth.

In a group with more complete data on risk factors (86 098 NAFLD and 4 664 988 matched controls), the hazard ratio for AMI after adjustment for systolic blood pressure, type  diabetes, total cholesterol level, statin use, and hypertension was 1.01 (0.91 to 1.12; 747 events in participants with NAFLD or NASH, 37 462 in matched controls). After adjustment for age and smoking status the pooled hazard ratio for stroke was 1.18 (1.11 to 1.24; 2187 events in participants with NAFLD or NASH, 134 001 in matched controls). In the group with more complete data on risk factors, the hazard ratio for stroke was 1.04 (0.99 to 1.09; 1666 events in participants with NAFLD, 83 882 in matched controls) after further adjustment for type  diabetes, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol level, statin use, and hypertension.The diagnosis of NAFLD in current routine care of 17.7 million patient appears not to be associated with AMI or stroke risk after adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiovascular risk assessment in adults with a diagnosis of NAFLD is important but should be done in the same way as for the general population.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

It is estimated that 75%-100% of individuals undergoing bariatric surgery have nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD).We aimed to investigate how an LCD affects  histology in the setting of NAFLD.University Hospital, United States.Forty intraoperative  specimens were analyzed histologically as follows: 20 with and 20 without a preoperative -week, 1200 kcal/d LCD. Weight was measured prediet, at surgery, and 6 months after surgery. NAFLD activity score was used to grade  histology at surgery. The NAFLD activity score scores steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis.The non-LCD group (n = 20) had mean weight at surgery of 136.1 ± 24.1 kg. The LCD group (n = 20) had initial mean weight of 128.6 ± 25.4 kg, with presurgical weight loss of 3.43 kg (range, 0-9.3 kg), mean change in body mass index 1.24 kg/m (.66% total weight loss) on an LCD. The LCD group had significantly less steatosis (P = .02), fewer foci of lobular inflammation (P = .01), and less hepatocellular ballooning (P = .04) compared with the non-LCD group; with no difference in degree of fibrosis. Fewer patients in the LCD group had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with ballooning (P = .04). Weight loss on an LCD before bariatric surgery was predictive of weight loss 6 months after surgery (P = .026).A -week LCD before bariatric surgery is associated with significant improvement in steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning in NAFLD.

PCOS is a known risk factor for imaging-confirmed steatosis, and we now aim to evaluate whether PCOS influences histologic severity of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).Retrospective study of women ages 18-45 years with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD between 2008-2019. Metabolic co-morbidities were captured within 6 months of biopsy. Histologic features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were independently evaluated by two pathologists blinded to PCOS status.Among 102 women meeting study criteria, 36% (n=37) had PCOS; median age was 35 years; 27% were white, 6% black, 19% Asian, and 47% reported Hispanic ethnicity. Women with PCOS had higher LDL (123 vs 101 mg/dL, p=0.02) and BMI (38 vs 33 kg/cm , p<0.01). NASH was present in 76% of women with PCOS vs 66% without PCOS (p=0.3), and a higher proportion with PCOS had severe ballooning (32 vs 13%, p=0.02), presence of any fibrosis (84 vs 66%, p=0.06), and advanced fibrosis (16 vs 6%, p=0.10). Adjusted for age and BMI, PCOS remained associated with severe hepatocyte ballooning (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-10.6, p=0.03) and advanced fibrosis (OR 7.1, 95% CI 1.3-39, p=0.02). Among women with advanced fibrosis, median age was 5 years younger in those with as compared to those without PCOS (40 vs 45 years, p=0.02).PCOS is independently associated with more severe NASH, including advanced fibrosis.

Dual-photon microscopy allows automated quantification of fibrosis-related parameters (q-FPs) and may facilitate large-scale histological studies. We aim to validate the performance of q-FPs in a large histological cohort.344 patients with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) underwent 428  biopsies (240 had paired transient elastography examination). Fibrosis stage was scored using the NASH Clinical Research Network system, and q-FPs were measured by dual-photon microscopy using unstained slides. Patients were randomly assigned to the training and validation cohorts to test the performance of individual q-FPs and derive optimal cut-offs.Over 25 q-FPs had area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves >0.90 for different fibrosis stages. Among them, the perimeter of collagen fibres and number of long collagen fibres had the highest accuracy. At the best cut-offs, the two q-FPs had 88.3%-96.% sensitivity and 78.1%-91.1% specificity for different fibrosis stages in the validation cohort. q-FPs and histological scoring had nearly identical correlations with  stiffness measurement, suggesting that the accuracy of q-FPs approached that of histological assessment. Among patients with paired  biopsies, changes in the same q-FPs were associated with changes in fibrosis stage. At a median follow-up of 5.6 years, baseline q-FPs predicted -related events.q-FP is highly accurate in the assessment of fibrosis in NAFLD patients. This automated platform can be used in future studies as objective and reliable evaluation of histological fibrosis.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

A high-fat diet (HFD)-induced T2DM rat model was established. The experimental rats were divided into the control group, HFD group, GM treatment group, DEX treatment group and GM + DEX treatment group. In addition, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C (CC) was used to inhibit AMPKα1 expression. All rats received their respective treatment daily for 21 days. Blood glucose and lipid levels, apoptosis of hepatic cells, and levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress indicators in serum samples were evaluated. Protein expression of AMPKα1 and its downstream targets were also investigated. Results demonstrated that blood glucose concentration, blood lipid indicators (endothelin, total cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol), cell apoptosis in  tissues, total oxidant status, malondialdehyde, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β levels in serum were increased in the high-fat group compared to the control but decreased following GM and/or DEX treatment. By contrast, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and antioxidative stress indicator superoxide dismutase (SOD) were decreased in the high-fat group but increased following GM and/or DEX treatment. Protein expression of AMPKα1 and the catabolic genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and acyl coenzyme A were decreased whilst anabolic genes, including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c,  acid synthase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase-, were increased in the HFD group. These effects were attenuated by GM and/or DEX treatment. AMPKα1 inhibition resulted in decreased SOD and increased cell apoptosis in  tissues as well as increased IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β levels compared with the HFD group. However, these effects were abolished following treatment with CC, GM and DEX together. Taken together these results indicated that GM worked synergistically with DEX to attenuate symptoms of high-fat-induced T2DM, with the effect potentially involving an increase in AMPKα1 expression.Copyright: © Sun et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593012>The Prevalence of Nonalcoholic  Pancreas by Endoscopic Ultrasonography.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic steatosis or  pancreas refers to the fat accumulation in the pancreas, which can lead to inflammation and fibrosis, β-cell dysfunction, fibrosis, and, possibly, pancreatic cancer.

With the current study we aimed to verify the modulatory effect of endocannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1)-signaling on perilipin  (PLIN2)-mediated lipophagy. Here, we demonstrate that a global knockout of the cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CB1) reduced the expression of the lipid droplet binding protein PLIN2 in the livers of CB1 and hepatitis B surface protein (HBs)-transgenic mice, which spontaneously develop hepatic steatosis. In addition, the pharmacologic activation and antagonization of CB1 in cell culture also caused an induction or reduction of PLIN2, respectively. The decreased PLIN2 expression was associated with suppressed lipogenesis and triglyceride (TG) synthesis and enhanced autophagy as shown by increased colocalization of LC3B with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in HBs/CB1 mice. The induction of autophagy was further supported by the increased expression of LAMP1 in CB1 and HBs/CB1 mice. LAMP1 and PLIN2 were co-localized in HBs/CB1 indicating autophagy of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) i.e., lipophagy. Lipolysis of lipid droplets was additionally indicated by elevated expression of lysosomal acid lipase. In conclusion, these results suggest that loss of CB1 signaling leads to reduced PLIN2 abundance, which triggers lipophagy. Our new findings about the association between CB1 signaling and PLIN2 may stimulate translational studies analyzing new diagnostic and therapeutic options for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675274>Relevant Features in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Determined Using Machine Learning for Feature Selection.</a></h2><p> We investigated the prevalence and the most relevant features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a stage of nonalcoholic  disease, (NAFLD) in which the inflammation of hepatocytes can lead to increased cardiovascular risk,  fibrosis, cirrhosis, and the need for  transplant.  We analyzed data from 2239 hypertensive patients using descriptive statistics and supervised machine learning algorithms, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and random forest classifier, to select the most relevant features of NASH.  The prevalence of NASH among our hypertensive patients was 11.3%. In univariate analyses, it was associated with metabolic syndrome, type  diabetes, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Ferritin and serum insulin were the most relevant features in the final model, with a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 79%, and area under the curve of 0.79.  Ferritin and insulin are significant predictors of NASH. Clinicians may use these to better assess cardiovascular risk and provide better management to hypertensive patients with NASH.

Changes in IHTG were assessed in several ways: as a continuous variable (correlations), as categorical groups (IHTG change ≥0%; or IHTG reduction of 1-30%; 31-50%; 51-70%; or >70%), and in a binomial way as steatosis resolution or not (defined as achieving IHTG <5.56%). Changes in IHTG correlated with steatosis on histology (r = 0.54; p <0.01). However, the magnitude of IHTG reduction was not associated with the rate of response of the primary histological outcome (-point improvement in the NAFLD activity score from  different parameters, without worsening of fibrosis) or resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis, neither in patients receiving pioglitazone nor placebo. Changes in lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, or  fibrosis were also independent of changes in IHTG, irrespective of treatment arm. Steatosis resolution was not associated with better histological outcomes either.Changes in IHTG predict changes in steatosis but not of other  histological parameters. This implies that IHTG response to treatment should be interpreted with caution, as it may not be as reliable as previously believed to predict a treatment's overall clinical efficacy in patients with NASH.Quantification of  fat by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used to assess treatment responses in patients with , with the assumption that improvements in  fat translate into less inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis in the .

Ultrasound machine and a structured self-administered questionnaire were used as instruments for recruiting data from the subjects. The subjects who consumed alcohol (>140 g/wk for men and >70 g/wk for females), had hepatitis B or C viruses,  insults, and surgery, and taken lipid-lowering medications were excluded from the study.A total of 628 subjects were analyzed, and 235 (37.4%) subjects were diagnosed with definite NAFLD. They comprised 518 (82.5%) Chinese, 92 (14.6%) Malays, and 18 (.9%) Indians. Peak prevalence of NAFLD was found in 53 to 60 years age group. The higher prevalence of NAFLD was among men (48.3%) than women (27.3%) and among Indians (61.1%) and Malays (51.1%) than among Chinese (34.%). NAFLD has been found to be strongly correlated with male sex, high body mass index (≥23.0 kg/m), hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.NAFLD is quite common among adults in Malaysian urban population. The prevalence of NAFLD was inordinately high among the 53 to 60 years age group, male sex, Indians, and Malays (as compared with Chinese). Age >60 years, male sex, high body mass index (≥23.0 kg/m), hypertriglyceridemia, and diabetes mellitus were proven to be risk predictors for NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor  (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in NAFLD.Human  biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by  fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of  biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and  assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total  cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile acid output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced  acid β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in  glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/ as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in .These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related metabolic conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

High fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced insulin resistance is implicated in multiple metabolic diseases, such as type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD), these metabolic diseases has become epidemic health issue worldwide. In this study, the effect of C. lanceolata polysaccharide (CLPS) on improving insulin sensitivity in chronic HFHS diet-fed mice was investigated. Our data indicates that CLPS significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting serum insulin (FINS) and insulin resistance index, in parallel with improved glucose and insulin tolerance impaired by HFHS diet. Impaired phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 were observed in the mice fed with HFHS diet, and those defects were also rescued by CLPS administration. In addition, CLPS caused a significant decrease in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidised glutathione (GSSG) ratio; concurrent with enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and activated Nrf2 signaling. In summary, these findings suggest that CLPS ameliorates HFHS diet-induced insulin resistance through activating anti-oxidative signaling pathway, providing new insights into the protective effects of C. lanceolata polysaccharide in metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019.

They are associated with severe endocrine-metabolic complications with significant morbidity and mortality. In the pathogenesis of the acquired forms, immunological disorders may be involved.A 13-year-old female was diagnosed with acquired generalized lipodystrophy and observed for suspicion of portal hypertension. She presented with generalized absence of adipose tissue, cervical and axillary acanthosis nigricans, and massive hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests revealed AST 116 IU/L, ALT 238 IU/L, GGT 114 IU/L, HOMA-IR 28., triglycerides 491 mg/L, and leptin < 0.05 ng/mL. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy saw no signs of portal hypertension. Hepatic histology showed macrovesicular  infiltration (60% of hepatocytes) and advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis. Her clinical condition worsened progressively to diabetes requiring treatment with subcutaneous insulin and hepatopulmonary syndrome.A 15-year-old female, diagnosed with acquired partial lipodystrophy, Parkinson syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia was observed for hypertransaminasemia since the age of 8 years. She had absence of subcutaneous adipose tissue in the upper and lower limbs and ataxia. Laboratory tests showed AST 461 IU/L, ALT 921 IU/L, GGT 145 IU/L, HOMA-IR 32.6, triglycerides 298 mg/dL, normal leptin levels, platelets 84,000/μL, IgG 1,894 mg/dL, positive anti-LKM and anti-LC-1. Hepatic histology was suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis, without steatosis. She progressed favorably under metformin and immunosuppressive treatment.Early recognition and adequate characterization of  disease in lipodystrophies is essential for a correct treatment approach. In acquired generalized lipodystrophy, the severe endocrine-metabolic disorder, which leads to steatohepatitis with cirrhotic progression, may benefit from recombinant leptin treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590127>Nr2e1 ablation impairs  glucolipid metabolism and induces inflammation, high-fat diets amplify the damage.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a common and complex metabolic disorder. Despite the widespread concern, there are still few effective treatments except lifestyle interventions. Nuclear receptor subfamily  group E member 1 (Nr2e1) is a transcription factor which regulates many biological processes, including development, growth, and differentiation of nerve cells. However, its specific function in hepatocyte is still unknown. In the present study, we found that the expression of Nr2e1 decreased in the livers of high-fat diet-fed mice. We generated Nr2e1 knockout (KO) mice and studied whether Nr2e1 ablation was related to NAFLD. We found that typical pathological features of NAFLD, including insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation, were present in Nr2e1-KO mice or high-fat diet-induced mice models. In conclusion, Nr2e1 ablation promotes  steatosis and systemic insulin resistance. Nr2e1 may play a protective role in the formation of NAFLD and may serve as a worthy therapeutic target for NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Although neonicotinoids display a high specificity for insects, their use has been recently debated since several studies led to the hypothesis that they may have adverse ecological effects and potential risks to mammals and even humans. Due to their hydrophobic nature, neonicotinoids need specific carriers to allow their distribution in body fluids. Human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant plasma protein, is a key carrier of endogenous and exogenous compounds. The in silico docking and ligand binding properties of acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam to HSA are here reported. Neonicotinoids bind to multiple  acid (FA) binding sites, preferentially to the FA1 pocket, with high affinity. Values of the dissociation equilibrium constant for neonicotinoid binding FA1 of HSA (i.e.,  K ) derived from in silico docking simulations (ranging between 3.9 × 10 and 6.3 × 10 M) agree with those determined experimentally from competitive inhibition of heme-Fe(III) binding (i.e.,  K ; ranging between .1 × 10 and 6.9 × 10 M). Accounting for the HSA concentration in vivo (~7.5 10 M), values of K here determined suggest that the formation of the HSA:neonicotinoid complexes may occur in vivo. Therefore, HSA appears to be an important determinant for neonicotinoid transport and distribution to tissues and organs, particularly to the  where they are metabolized.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646122>Nonalcoholic  disease: implications for cardiovascular risk.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a growing epidemic in the USA affecting ∼30% of the population.

The CBS-containing serum of mice was obtained by serum pharmacology method to evaluate its effect on the proliferation of LO2 hepatocytes. The lipid reducing effects of CBS-containing serum through Nrf2 was evaluated by fructose-induced LO2 hepatocyte steatosis model,nuclear factor erythroid  related factor ( Nrf2) agonist oltipraz combined intervention,cell oil red O staining and intracellular triglyceride( TG) content. The effects of CBS-containing serum on lipid peroxidation and hepatocytes apoptosis were evaluated by reactive oxygen species( ROS) and apoptosis assay,respectively. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction( PCR) was used to detect the relative expression of lipid synthesis-related genes and apoptosis-related genes.RESULTS:: showed that CBS drug-containing serum had no significant effect on LO2 hepatocyte proliferation. As compared with the model group,CBS-containing serum could effectively reduce the formation of lipid droplets in fructose-induced LO2 hepatocytes,significantly reduce intracellular TG and ROS levels,and significantly reduce hepatocyte apoptosis rate( P < 0. 05). As compared with the model group,carbohydrate responsive element binding protein( ChREBP),sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 c( SREBP-1 c), acid synthase( FAS),acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1( ACC1),stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1( SCD1),Bax and caspase-3 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in CBS drug-containing serum treatment group( P<0. 05). All of the above effects could be reversed by oltipraz.In conclusion,CBS-containing serum can significantly inhibit the fructose-induced LO2  fat deposition,and the mechanism may be related to reducing intracellular ROS level through the Nrf2 pathway and improving intracellular peroxidation state to reduce apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574855>Chronic hepatitis C virus infection: Relationships between inflammatory marker levels and compensated  cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>We investigated associations between inflammatory marker levels and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related compensated  cirrhosis risk in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection in China. We used a case-control design and data from the records of 110 Chinese patients with CHC and cirrhosis for the study; 458 CHC patients who did not have a diagnosis of cirrhosis were matched to the case group by age and sex characteristics. We also investigated  disease risk factors. The group of patients with CHC infection and cirrhosis had lower platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) values (60.63 [44.09, 89.31]) compared with the control group patients (80.24 [57.85, 111.08]). The results indicated that the group of patients with cirrhosis had higher 4-factor fibrosis index and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) values compared with the group of patients with CHC-only (1.66 [0.98, .60] vs 0.71 [0.45, 1.17], respectively; P < .001 and .12 [0.97, 4.25] vs 0.99 [0.51, .01], respectively; P < .001). Compared with the control group, the AST/alanine aminotransferase ratio (AAR) values in the group of patients with cirrhosis were significantly higher (P < .001). Logistic regression analysis that included model adjustment for demographic characteristics and other factors that could affect cirrhosis risk revealed that greater 1/PLR values were associated with an increased odds of having cirrhosis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.991 [0.985-0.996]); APRI and AAR values were also independent predictors of the presence of compensated cirrhosis. We found that compared with the patients with CHC-only, the triglyceride, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the patients with both CHC and  disease were significantly higher. The multivariate analysis of the risk of  development in patients with CHC infection found that cholesterol level was a statistically significant risk factor (AOR [95% CI] 1.380 [1.089-1.750], P = .008). Increased 1/PLR, APRI, and AAR values were associated with increased risks for development of cirrhosis in this population of Chinese patients with CHC infection.

Oestrogen injections induced FLHS, but the incidence and severity of the condition was increased with a combination of E & LPS. Hepatic mRNA levels of the genes encoding key regulators of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were evaluated. The expression of IL-6 mRNA in hepatocytes of all treated groups (E, LPS and E & LPS hens) was elevated from 6 to 56 fold (< 0.01), when compared to baseline and control values, with the highest fold change at 3 h post-treatment. The mRNA levels for IL-1β were better expressed at 24 h post-treatments with E, LPS and E & LPS. The expression of IL-18 mRNA in the  tissue was lower than IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA in all treated birds. At 24 h post-treatments, total white blood cell (WBC) counts and fibrinogen levels were elevated (< 0.05) in E, LPS and E & LPS treated hens. Histologically, livers of hens from E and E & LPS treated groups revealed inflammatory alterations with areas showing mononuclear aggregations, vacuolar  degeneration of hepatocytes, and increased sinusoidal congestion and haemorrhages. It was concluded that  lipid accumulation and injury were associated with incidences of local (hepatic) and systemic inflammation, which could have initiated  blood vessel and capsule rupture and subsequently the onset of FLHS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569345>The Association between Adult Weight Gain and Insulin Resistance at Middle Age: Mediation by Visceral Fat and  Fat.</a></h2><p>We aimed to investigate the role of the amount of visceral fat and  fat in the association between adult weight change and insulin resistance at middle age. In the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study, adult weight change was calculated with recalled body weight at age 20 years and measured body weight at middle age. Measures of insulin resistance were calculated using both fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations. Visceral fat was assessed by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and  fat by proton-MR spectroscopy ( = 1758). We examined the association between adult weight change and insulin resistance with linear regression, adjusted for confounding factors. To investigate mediation, we additionally adjusted for total body fat, visceral fat, and  fat. In participants who gained ≥50% of body weight during adulthood, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was 3.22 (95% CI .76; 3.77) times higher than in weight maintainers. In a joint model, total body fat mediated this association for 8.1% (95% CI -9.; 25.4), visceral fat for 32.0% (18.6; 45.4%) and  fat for 22.5% (15.0; 30.1).

A total of 80 C57BL/6J Narl mice were randomly divided into five groups: 3-month-old group, 9-month-old group, 14-month-old group, 20-month-old group, and FTZ treatment group (20 months old). The mice in the treatment group received a therapeutic dose of oral FTZ extract (1.0 g/kg, on raw material weight basis) once daily during the experiment. The other groups received the corresponding volume of oral normal saline solution.  samples of all five groups were collected after 12 weeks, and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was used to analyze metabolic changes. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to analyze the resulting data. Additionally, cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-6, 5-LOX, and COX-, as well as their relative mRNA expression in the  were determined.  The levels of TC, TG, AST, and ALT were increased, and  tissue structure was damaged. The secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-6, 5-LOX, and COX-, as well as their relative mRNA expression in the  also increased with aging. FTZ administration reduced the symptoms of  aging. The OPLS-DA score plot illustrated the effect of FTZ against  aging, with N-acetyl-leukotriene E4, 20-hydroxy-leukotriene E4, leukotriene E4, and arachidonic acid among the key biomarkers. The pivotal pathways revealed by pathway analysis included arachidonic acid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated  acids. The mechanism by which FTZ reduces the symptoms of  aging in mice might be related to disorders of the abovementioned pathways.  A metabolomic approach based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and multivariate statistical analysis was successfully applied to investigate the metabolic trajectory of  aging. FTZ has a protective effect against  aging, which may be mediated  interference with the metabolism of arachidonic acid, biosynthesis of unsaturated  acids, and downregulation of pro-inflammatory factors in the  in mice .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592493>Impact of Hepatic Steatosis on Resting Metabolic Rate and Metabolic Adaptation in Response to Intentional Weight Loss.</a></h2><p>Weight loss is the primary intervention for nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). A decrease in resting metabolic rate (RMR) out of proportion to the degree of weight loss may promote weight regain. We aimed to determine the impact of hepatic steatosis on weight loss-associated changes in RMR and metabolic adaptation, defined as the difference between predicted and measured RMR after weight loss. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from 114 subjects without diabetes (52 with NAFLD), with body mass index (BMI) >35, and who enrolled in a 6-month weight loss intervention. Hepatic steatosis was determined by unenhanced computed tomography scans by :spleen attenuation ratio <1.1. RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry. At baseline, patients with hepatic steatosis had higher BMI, fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and RMR (RMR, 1,933 kcal/day; 95% confidence interval [CI], 841-,025 kcal/day; versus 1,696; 95% CI, 1,641-1,751;  < 0.0001). After 6 months, the NAFLD group experienced larger absolute declines in weight, FM, and FFM, but percentage changes in weight, FFM, and FM were similar between groups. A greater decline in RMR was observed in patients with NAFLD (-179 kcal/day; 95% CI, -233 to -126 kcal/day; versus -100; 95% CI, -51 to -150;  = 0.0154) for the time × group interaction, and patients with NAFLD experienced greater metabolic adaptation to weight loss (-97 kcal/day; 95% CI, -143 to -50 kcal/day; versus -31.7; 95% CI, -74 to 11;  = 0.0218) for the prediction × group interaction. The change (Δ) in RMR was significantly associated with ΔFM, ΔFFM, and baseline RMR, while metabolic adaptation was significantly associated with female sex and ΔFM only.  Hepatic steatosis is associated with a greater reduction in FM, which predicts RMR decline and a higher metabolic adaptation after weight loss, potentially increasing the risk of long-term weight regain.© 2019 The Authors.

First, mice aged five weeks were divided into two groups (vehicle group and canagliflozin group) and were treated for three weeks. Then, mice aged five weeks were divided into three groups of nine animals each: the vehicle group, early canagliflozin group (treated from five to nine weeks), and continuous canagliflozin group (treated from five to 16 weeks). Canagliflozin was administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg in these experiments. In addition, the in vitro effects of canagliflozin were investigated using HepG2 cells, a human HCC cell line. At the age of eight or 16 weeks, the histological non-alcoholic  disease activity score was lower in the canagliflozin-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice. There were significantly fewer hepatic tumors in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly fewer glutamine synthetase-positive nodules in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Expression of α-fetoprotein mRNA, a marker of HCC, was downregulated in the continuous canagliflozin group when compared with the vehicle group. At 16 weeks, there was diffuse SGLT1 expression in the hepatic lobules and strong expression by hepatocytes in the vehicle group, while SGLT2 expression was stronger in  tumors than in the lobules. In the in vitro study, canagliflozin (10 μM) suppressed the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry showed that canagliflozin reduced the percentage of HepG2 cells in the G2/M phase due to arrest in the G1 phase along with decreased expression of cyclin D and Cdk4 proteins, while it increased the percentage of cells in the G0/1 phase. Canagliflozin also induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells via activation of caspase 3. In this mouse model of diabetes and NASH/HCC, canagliflozin showed anti-steatotic and anti-inflammatory effects that attenuated the development of NASH and prevented the progression of NASH to HCC, partly due to the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis as well as the reduction of tumor growth through the direct inhibition of SGLT2 in tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647808>Causal relationships between obesity and the leading causes of death in women and men.</a></h2><p>Obesity traits are causally implicated with risk of cardiometabolic diseases. It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of obesity traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three obesity traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran's Q-test (Phet). A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type  and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic  disease, chronic  disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type  diabetes in women than in men (Phet = 1.4×10-5). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phet = 3.7×10-6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (Phet = 1.0×10-4) in men than women. Obesity traits have an etiological role in the majority of the leading global causes of death. Sex differences exist in the effects of obesity traits on risk of type  diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure, which may have downstream implications for public health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599882>INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR BINDING PROTEIN-1, NON-ALCOHOLIC  DISEASE, AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH FRUCTOSE CONSUMPTION IN CHILDREN WITH OBESITY.</a></h2><p>Over consumption of added sugar is associated with obesity, non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), and insulin resistance (IR).The objective of the study was to study the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and NAFLD and their relationship with fructose consumption in children with obesity.A cross-sectional study was carried out in children 6-11 years old with obesity. Anthropometric measurements, fructose consumption, glucose, lipid profile, insulin, and IGFBP-1 levels were evaluated; the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) was used. NAFLD was evaluated by ultrasound.We studied 83 children with a mean age of 9. ± 1.3 years. About 93% of the girls presented IR and lower levels of IGFBP-1 (p = 0.0001). The group with the lower levels of IGFBP-1 had higher HOMA-IR (p = 0.000002); IGFBP-1 was associated with fructose consumption (r = -0.25; p = 0.03), body mass index (BMI) (r=-0.42; p = 0.02), and HOMA-IR (r=-0.61; p = 0.002). About 81% of the children were classified as having mild or moderate/severe NAFLD, and these groups had higher HOMA-IR (p = 0.036) and fructose consumption (p = 0.0014).The girls had more metabolic alterations. The group with lower levels of IGFBP-1 (hepatic IR) was associated with higher BMI, HOMA-IR, and fructose consumption; the group with higher severity of NAFLD showed higher HOMA-IR and fructose consumption.Copyright: © 2019 Permanyer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626206>[Evaluation of the effect of remaxol on hepatocytes in non-alcoholic  dystrophy modeling in laboratory C57BL/6 mice].</a></h2><p>To provide a morphological evaluation of the effectiveness of incorporating remaxol into a treatment regimen for non-alcoholic  disease.The investigation was conducted using 32 male C57BL/6 mice weighing 35-44 g, which were divided into 4 groups. In Group 1, eight mice were fed with a standard diet for 75 days; the animals from Groups  and 3 received a hypercaloric diet for the same period of time. The mice from Group  were euthanized immediately after the diet was stopped; and Group 3 was switched to the standard diet after 20 days of the recovery period. Group 4 included the mice that were, after a 75-day hypercaloric diet, were injected with remaxol at a dose of 25 ml/kg once daily every other day; the cycle consisted of 10 injections.  tissues were morphologically evaluated using Oil Red O-stained tissue specimens additionally stained with Mayer's hematoxylin on the cryostat sections applying a Zeiss Axio Imager. A2 microscope equipped with an Axiocam 506 color camera. The photographed images were processed using the ZEN .3 program ('Carl Zeiss', Germany).The morphological equivalent of  improvement in mice that were injected and were not injected with remaxol was found to be normalization of the lobular structure, preservation of the structure and intralobular orientation of the hepatic tubules, and restoration of the width of the sinusoidal lumen. The degree of infiltration was much lesser than that in the group of experimental animals that did not additionally receive the drug.These histological signs may suggest that remaxol is effective in treating non-alcoholic  disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640183>Water Extract of  L. Ameliorates Non-Alcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Our aim was to investigate whether hot water extract (CLW) of  L. could prevent non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). HepG2 cells were treated with free  acid (FFA) mixture (oleic acid: palmitic acid, :1) for 24 h to stimulate in vitro . In addition, C57BL/6 mice were fed 60 kcal% high-fat (HF) diet for eight weeks to induce  in vivo. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions were increased by FFA and HF-diet, but supplementation with CLW significantly decreased these levels. CLW treatment ameliorated antioxidant activities that were suppressed by exposure to the FFA and HF-diet. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and  acid transport proteins (FATP2 and FATP5) were increased in HF-diet groups, while CLW suppressed their expression levels. Moreover, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and  acid synthase (FAS) expression levels were down-regulated in the CLW groups compared to HF-diet groups. On the other hand, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) expressions were up-regulated in the CLW groups. HF-diet fed mice showed high hepatic triglycerides (TG) content compared to the normal diet mice. However, the administration of CLW restored the hepatic TG level, indicating an inhibitory effect against lipid accumulation by CLW. These results suggest that CLW could be a potentially useful agent for the prevention of NAFLD through modulating  acid uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656291>The Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on Obesity and Obesity-related Disease : the Results of 10 Initial Cases.</a></h2><p>Introduction : The number of patients who undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been increasing.

As such, we aimed to demonstrate the trend of NAFLD, NAFLD with renal insufficiency (RI), disease awareness, and mortality over time. Patient data were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2016. A total of 14,255 adult study participants without competing  disease or heavy drinking and with complete laboratory data were included. NAFLD was defined using the U.S.  Index (USFLI) and RI was defined using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation and urine albumin:creatinine ratio. Death data were obtained from the National Death Index (up to December 31, 2015). Prevalence of NAFLD in participants was 31.% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.01-32.46); of these participants, 22.05% (95% CI, 20.34-23.85) had RI. From 1999 to 2016, prevalence of both NAFLD without RI ( 0.048) and NAFLD-RI ( 0.006) increased significantly. Among those with NAFLD-RI, awareness of kidney disease was 8.56% (95% CI, 6.69-10.89), while awareness of  disease among all NAFLD was 4.49% (95% CI, 3.17-6.33). Among those with NAFLD, mortality incidence per 1,000 person years was highest among those with severe RI in all-cause mortality (104.4; 95% CI, 83.65-130.39) and other residual causes of mortality (mean, 50.88; 95% CI, 37.02-69.93).  Prevalence of NAFLD and NAFLD-RI has increased over the past  decades in the United States. Low kidney disease and  disease awareness are major public health issues as those with NAFLD-RI have significantly higher mortality than those with only NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

We aimed to characterize risk factors for NAFLD-HCC development.We performed a retrospective case-control study of HCC cases from a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent at least  computed tomography scans. NAFLD-HCC cases confirmed on contrast imaging and/or biopsy were included. Controls were NAFLD patients without HCC matched by sex and age. Clinical variables were assessed. Visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured by computed tomography at  timepoints: before HCC diagnosis and at diagnosis.We identified 102 subjects [34 HCC cases, 68 controls, 65% (n=66) males, mean age: 69 y] from 2002 to 2016. Cirrhosis was present in 91%. In multivariate analysis, statin use was protective against HCC [odds ratio (OR)=0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07-0.60, P=0.004], while hypertension was a risk factor for HCC (OR=5.80, 95% CI: .01-16.75, P=0.001). In multivariate analysis, visceral adipose tissue in males was higher before HCC diagnosis and declined by HCC diagnosis in 86%, which was a significant difference compared with controls (OR=.78, 95% CI: 1.10-7.44, P=0.04).In a cohort of NAFLD-HCC patients, statin use was protective against HCC, while hypertension conferred an increased risk. Visceral adiposity at baseline was not a risk factor, but was higher in male patients before HCC development, declining in the majority by HCC diagnosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626819>Perioperative Omega-3  Acids Fails to Confer Protection in  Surgery. Results of a multicentric, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>To investigate the perioperative use of Omega-3 polyunsaturated  acids (Ω3-FA) to reduce post-operative complications after  surgery.In a variety of animal models, Ω3-FA disclosed strong protective effects in alleviating hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury and steatosis with enhancement of regeneration after major tissue loss. Given these benefits along with its safety profile, we hypothesized that perioperative administration of Ω3-FA in patients undergoing  surgery may ameliorate the post-operative course.A multi-centric, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was designed to test whether two single intravenous infusions of Omegaven (Ω3-FA) vs. placebo may decrease morbidity. The primary endpoints were postoperative complications by severity (Clavien-Dindo classification) integrated in the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI).Between July 2013 and July 2018, 261 patients (132 in the Omegaven and 129 in the placebo groups) were included in the trial from three centers. Most cases (87%, n=227) underwent open  surgery and 56% (n=105) were major resections (≥3 segments). In an intention-to-treat analysis including the drop out cases, the mortality rate was 4% and % in the OmegavenTM and placebo groups (P=0.447; OR: 95%CI: 0.04-.51), respectively. Any complications and major complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥3b) occurred in 46% vs. 43% (P=0.709) and 12% vs. 10% (P=0.69) in the Omegaven and placebo groups, respectively. The mean CCI was 17 (±23) vs.14 (±20) (P=0.417). An analysis excluding the drop-outs provided similar figures.The routine perioperative use of two single doses of intravenous Ω3-FA (100ml Omegaven) cannot be recommended in patients undergoing  surgery (Grade A recommendation).This trial fails to detect an effect on the use of two single Omega-3  acid infusions before and during  surgery to reduce complications. Despite strong evidence of -directed anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative action in various rodent models, this trial fails to confer  protection with single Omega-3  acid infusions and is therefore currently not recommended.Copyright © 2019.

Similar study was done in the normal glucose tolerance and prediabetes groups separately. These parameters were then compared with those of 75 matched diabetic teetotallers with NAFLD. To analyse further the difference between normal glucose tolerance, prediabetic and overt diabetic groups, binary logistic regression of the factors was carried out taking prediabetes and diabetes as outcome variable.All the metabolic parameters were significantly higher in diabetics compared to non diabetics and in prediabetics compared to those with normal glucose tolerance except high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and BMI significantly predicted NFS in the overall (adjusted R2 68.7%, P=0.000) and normal glucose tolerance groups (adjusted R2 73.%, P=0.000) whereas BMI, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and HbA1c did in prediabetics (adjusted R2 89%, P=0.000).

High triglyceride (odds ratio1.08), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (odds ratio1.03) and HbA1c (odds ratio 11.54) were positively associated with prediabetes compared to normal glucose tolerance group.In nondiabetic teetotallers dyslipidemias are the prime contributors to the development of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633718>NONALCOHOLIC  DISEASE (NAFLD), MORE THAN A  DISEASE.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565874>Nonalcoholic  Disease and Diabetes: An Epidemiological Perspective.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is thought to stem from the body's inability to store excess energy in adipocytes; as such, it is commonly viewed as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. The pathogenesis of NAFLD involves ectopic fat accumulation, which also takes place in the , muscle and visceral fat. NAFLD is rapidly becoming more widespread in Korea, with an estimated prevalence of 30% in adults. Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and NAFLD share insulin resistance as a common pathophysiological mechanism, and each of these two diseases affects the development of the other. Recent studies have suggested that NAFLD is often present as a comorbidity in T2DM patients. The mutual interrelationship between these conditions is shown by findings suggesting that T2DM can exacerbate NAFLD by promoting progression to nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis or fibrosis, while NAFLD causes the natural course of diabetic complications to worsen in T2DM patients. It remains unknown whether one disease is the cause of the other or vice versa. In this review, I would like to discuss current epidemiological data on the associations between NAFLD and T2DM, and how each disease affects the course of the other.Copyright © 2019 Korean Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548064>Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) administration to early-lactating dairy cows. II. Pharmacokinetics, whole-animal performance, and lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Dairy cows cope with severe energy insufficiency in early lactation by engaging in intense and sustained mobilization of  acids from adipose tissue. An unwanted side effect of this adaptation is excessive lipid accumulation in the , which in turn impairs hepatic functions. Mice experiencing increased hepatic  acid flux are protected from this condition through coordinated actions of the newly described hormone fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) on  and adipose tissue. The possibility of an analogous role for FGF21 in dairy cows is suggested by its rapid increase in plasma levels around parturition followed by chronically elevated levels in the first few weeks of lactation. To test this hypothesis, dairy cows were randomly assigned on d 12.6 ± . (± standard error) of lactation to receive either an excipient (control; n = 6) or recombinant human FGF21 (n = 7), first as an FGF21 bolus of 3 mg/kg of body weight (BW) followed  d later by a constant i.v. infusion of FGF21 at a rate of 6.3 mg/kg of metabolic BW for 9 consecutive days. After bolus administration, human FGF21 circulated with a half-life of 194 min, and its constant infusion increased total plasma concentration 117-fold over levels in excipient-infused cows. The FGF21 treatment had no effect on voluntary feed intake, milk yield, milk energy output, or net energy balance measured over the 9-d infusion or on final BW. Plasma  acids circulated at lower concentrations in the FGF21 group than in the control group for the 8-h period following bolus administration, but this reduction was not significant during the period of constant i.v. infusion. Treatment with FGF21 caused a 50% reduction in triglyceride content in  biopsies taken at the end of the constant i.v. infusion without altering the mRNA abundance of key genes involved in the transport, acyl coenzyme A activation, or oxidation of  acids. In contrast, FGF21 treatment ablated the recovery of plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 seen in control cows during the 9-d i.v. infusion period despite a tendency for higher plasma growth hormone. This effect was associated with increased hepatic mRNA abundance of the intracellular inhibitor of growth hormone receptor trafficking, LEPROT. Overall, these data confirm the ability of FGF21 to reduce lipid accumulation in bovine  and suggest the possibility that FGF21 does so by attenuating the hepatic influx of adipose tissue-derived  acids.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound -(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal  acid oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic acid, Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial  acid oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and  were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and . Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were obesity [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid obesity [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (5.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = .05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (.23-8.61)].

After median follow-up of 127 months (range 4-175 months), 10-year RFS was 22% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17-27%]. Ten-year cumulative incidence for IHR, EHR, and DWR was 37%, 30%, and 12%, respectively. After controlling for confounders, NAS ≥ 3 was independently associated with higher risk of IHR [hazard ratio (HR) 1.76, 95% CI 1.07-.90, p = 0.027] and lower risk of EHR (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.75, p = 0.019) on multivariable analysis.Severe HPD was associated with increased IHR risk and decreased EHR risk. Future investigation into whether improving HPD from reversible etiologies can reduce the risk for IHR is warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623522>The Triglyceride Paradox Is Related to Lipoprotein Size, Visceral Adiposity and Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase Activity in Black Versus White Women.</a></h2><p> In black women, triglycerides are paradoxically normal in the presence of insulin resistance. This relationship may be explained by race-related differences in central adiposity and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) enzyme activity index.  In a cross-sectional study, to compare fasting and postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle (TRLP) concentrations and size in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women and determine the relationship between TRLP subfractions and whole-body insulin sensitivity, hepatic and visceral fat, and SCD-1 levels.  In 122 federally employed women without diabetes, 73 black (58 African American and 15 African immigrant) and 49 white; age 44{plus minus}10 (mean{plus minus}SD); BMI 30.0{plus minus}5.6 kg/m2 we measured lipoprotein subfractions using nuclear magnetic resonance. Hepatic fat was measured by proton MRS, insulin sensitivity index (SI) calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose test, RBC  acid profiles by gas chromatography were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, S, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with S and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat, and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR= 0.39, P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007).  Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite insulin resistance in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women. Similar concentrations of very small TRLPs are related to insulin resistance and could be important mediators of cardiometabolic disease risk in women.  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668723>Dietary n-6 to n-3  acid ratio is related to  fat content independent of genetic effects: Evidence from the monozygotic co-twin control design.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle changes focusing on diet and exercise remain the cornerstone of the treatment of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). The present co-twin control study of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs was designed to identify nutritional factors potentially involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.Cross-sectional study of 50 MZ twin pairs (age range: 23-36 years), of which ten pairs were discordant for  fat ( fat percentage of one twin ≤5% and his/her co-twin >5% and a difference between co-twins of >5%) as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Nutrient intake was calculated from 3-day food records.Among the ten  fat-discordant twin pairs, the n-6: n-3 ratio was significantly higher in the twins with higher  as compared to their co-twins with lower  fat (6.6:1 vs. 3.:1, p-value = 0.005). In multiple regression analysis of within-pair differences including all 50 twin pairs, a higher n-6: n-3 ratio was significantly associated with a higher  fat percentage within MZ twin pairs after adjustment for body mass index, energy intake and other covariates (standardized beta = 0.43, p-value = 0.001).Our findings suggest that the n-6: n-3 ratio is a promising dietary agent for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

While angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the cleavage of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, the active peptide that causes a pressor response, the ARBs inhibit its peripheral action. The ARBs reduce blood pressure in animal models as well as in humans. Since their introduction in 1995, these agents have been used widely in the therapy of hypertension and to reduce the complications of hypertensive cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs in clinical use in the United States include eight agents of similar chemical structure and activity, but somewhat different pharmacokinetics: losartan (Cozaar: 1995), valsartan (Diovan: 1996), irbesartan (Avapro: 1997), eprosartan (Teveten: 1997), candesartan (Atacand: 1998), telmisartan (Micardis: 1998), olmesartan (Benicar: 2002) and azilsartan (Edarbi: 2011). All of these agents have been associated with a minimal rate of serum enzyme elevations during chronic therapy (0.% to %) which are usually mild-to-moderate in severity, self limited, and rarely require dose modification or discontinuation. As a class, the ARBs have been associated with rare instances of acute  injury that is usually self limited in duration, but varies in clinical expression, being usually hepatocellular but occasional cholestatic in nature. The most common presentation of  injury due to these agents is a cholestatic hepatitis arising within 1 to 8 weeks of starting and resolving as rapidly with stopping. Rare instances of prolonged jaundice have been described but not acute  failure or autoimmune chronic hepatitis. Several Individual case reports of clinically apparent  injury have been published in the literature for losartan, valsartan, irbesartan olmesartan and candesartan, but not specifically for azilsartan, eprosartan, and telmisartan, probably because these three have been in use for a shorter period of time and in fewer subjects. Most ARBs and particularly olmesartan have been linked to rare instances of severe sprue-like enteropathy. The enteropathy typically presents with severe diarrhea and weight loss with variable degrees of fatigue, nausea and abdominal discomfort arising 6 months to many years after starting the ARB. Small intestinal histological findings resemble those of celiac disease with flattening of the duodenal villuous pattern and villous atrophy. However, anti-transglutaminase and endomysial antibodies (the serologic markers of celiac disease) are negative and there is little or no response to a gluten-free diet. Withdrawal of the ARB, however, results in prompt improvement in the diarrhea and gradual resolution of duodenal villous flattening. Some cases of this drug induced enteropathy have had accompanying serum aminotransferase elevations and  by imaging or  biopsy, which, along with the diarrhea, resolve rapidly with stopping the medication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562711>Association between Non- alcoholic  Disease and Left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction in Patients of Type  Diabetes.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the study was to assess if non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in diabetic patients increases the risk and/or severity of diastolic dysfunction.We studied 70 type  diabetic individuals without a history of ischemic heart disease, hepatic diseases, or excessive alcohol consumption, in whom NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonography. All patients had normal left ventricular systolic function and blood pressure values under medication. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was assessed by pulsed wave Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging, studying mitral inflow patterns and E wave, E' wave velocities, E/A and E/E' ratios.Fifty seven patients (81.43%) had NAFLD, and when compared with the other 13(18.57%) patients, age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, hypertension, smoking, diabetes duration, microvascular complication status, and medication use were not significantly different. In addition, the left ventricular (LV) mass and volumes, ejection fraction, systemic vascular resistance, arterial elasticity, and compliance were also not different. NAFLD patients had lower E' (8.42±0.89 vs.9.72±0.54, P <0.0001) tissue velocity, higher E-to-E' ratio (9.64±1.83 vs. 7.78±0.89, p<0.001), higher LV-end diastolic pressure (EDP) (15.52 ± 0.69 vs. 14.40±0.9 p <0.0001), higher LV EDP/end diastolic volume LV EDP/EDV (mmHg/ mL) (0.19 ±0.15 vs. 0.17±.02 p < 0.001) and higher glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C) (8.53±1.02 vs.7.65±0.66 p<0.01) than those without steatosis. All of these differences remained significant after adjustment for hypertension and other cardio metabolic risk factors. Our data show that in patients with type2 diabetes and NAFLD, even if the LV morphology and systolic function are preserved, early features of LV diastolic dysfunction detected.

Thus, here, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis on NAFLD prevalence in the lean or nonobese population to give clarity.PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to identify studies reporting NAFLD prevalence in the lean/nonobese population. Lean or nonobese was defined by body mass index cutoffs reported by authors in original studies. NAFLD prevalence based on community, population, or health checkups was combined with random-effect model after logit transformation. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were further performed to investigate the heterogenicity.A total of 45 studies were enrolled in the final analysis, with 55,936 lean/nonobese subjects included, among whom 7351 NAFLD patients were diagnosed. Overall, the pooled NAFLD prevalence of the lean or nonobese population was 10.% (95% confidence interval: 7.6%-13.6%) and 15.7% (95% confidence interval: 12.5%-19.6%), respectively. Compared with western studies, the NAFLD prevalence in the lean or nonobese population was lower in eastern studies. In addition, the NAFLD prevalence in both the lean and nonobese population showed a general upward trend during recent years. The prevalence was similar in community-based and health checkup-based studies. Lean/nonobese NAFLD patients had significantly lower rates of hypertension, lower uric acid and fasting plasma glucose, and a higher level of high-density lipoprotein than nonlean/obese patients.The prevalence of NAFLD in the lean/nonobese population is not rare in either the western or eastern regions of the world.

In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1. kg/m , glucose 103± mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated  enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C -acetate IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function. These data support the therapeutic potential of FASi, TVB-2640 in particular, in patients with NAFLD and NASH.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625959>Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance closely related to lobular inflammation in nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) has been established as a major risk factor for nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) where it exerts effects on plasma glucose homeostasis, cellular anabolism, and organ glucose uptake. Owing to paucity of studies focused on peripheral IR in relation to pathological outcome, we aim to investigate homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) by histological characteristics of NAFLD. biopsy of 588 patients was screened. After excluding etiologies other than NAFLD and factors contributing to IR, serum HOMA-IR was compared with patients' histologic features. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess their relationship. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was calculated to assess the discriminatory ability of homeostatic model assessment of IR for advanced lobular inflammation (LI).We observed higher serum level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and low-density lipoprotein as HOMA-IR increased. HOMA-IR is significantly associated with severity of LI (odds ratio = 1.222, 95% confidence interval = 1.135-1.315, P < 0.001), similar association remained after adjusting for age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides (odds ratio = 1.205, 95% confidence interval = 1.102-1.317, P < 0.001). HOMA-IR is discriminant of LI with AUROC = 0.832 and cutoff = .995 (sensitivity = 0.938, specificity = 0.569).This study demonstrated a strong and independent association of HOMA-IR with the severity of  inflammation by histological evaluation in NAFLD patients without diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and its possible role in diagnosis of LI could be translated into clinical assessment of NAFLD patients with uncertainty of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564942>The interplay between abdominal aortic aneurysm, metabolic syndrome and  disease: a retrospective case-control study.</a></h2><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and  disease are both associated with the metabolic syndrome (MS); the aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with AAA are also at a higher risk for  disease.A case-control retrospective study.

Many metabolic and immune response pathways or nutrient- and pathogen-sensing systems are evolutionarily conserved throughout species. As a result, the immune response and metabolic regulation are highly integrated and the proper function of each is dependent on the other. This interaction between metabolic disturbances and the immune system has been most extensively studied in disorders related to obesity such as insulin resistance, type  diabetes, and nonalcoholic  disease. Metabolically induced inflammation seems also to play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis including its complications such as myocardial infarction (MI) and post-MI remodeling.

NAFLD is strongly associated with type  diabetes mellitus, obesity and cardiovascular disease and begins with intrahepatic triacylglycerol accumulation. Under healthy conditions, the  regulates lipid metabolism to meet systemic energy needs in the fed and fasted states. The processes of  acid uptake,  acid synthesis and the intracellular partitioning of  acids into storage, oxidation and secretion pathways are tightly regulated. When one or more of these processes becomes dysregulated, excess lipid accumulation can occur. Although genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the development of NAFLD, it remains unclear why an imbalance in these pathways begins. The regulation of  acid partitioning occurs at several points, including during triacylglycerol synthesis, lipid droplet formation and lipolysis. These processes are influenced by enzyme function, intake of dietary fats and sugars and whole-body metabolism, and are further affected by the presence of obesity or insulin resistance.

However, the association between VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) with premature atherosclerosis and (i.e. arterial) inflammation is not completely understood. To provide more insight into this association, we investigated the association between arterial F-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) uptake, as a measure of arterial inflammation, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) markers in early T2DM patients.Forty-four patients with early T2DM, without glucose lowering medication, were studied (median age 63 [IQR 54-66] years, median BMI 30.4 [IQR 27.5-35.8]). Arterial inflammation was quantified using glucose corrected maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) FDG of the aorta, carotid, iliac, and femoral arteries, and corrected for background activity (blood pool) as target-to-background ratio (TBR).

Interaction term VAT volume * sex and additional components including HbA1c, insulin resistance, NAFLD, adiponectin, leptin, and C- reactive protein (CRP) did not change the independent association between VAT volume and TBR.CT-assessed VAT volume is positively associated with FDG-PET assessed arterial inflammation, independently of factors thought to potentially mediate these effects. These findings suggest that VAT in contrast to SAT is linked to early atherosclerotic changes in T2DM patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this research was to analyze and summarize randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of probiotics on NAFLD.Seven databases (PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang Data, and VIP Database) were searched. Then, eligible studies were identified. Finally, proper data extraction, synthesis and analysis were performed by trained researchers.Anthropometric parameters: with use of probiotics weight was reduced by .31 kg, and body mass index (BMI) was reduced by 1.08 kg/m.  function: probiotic treatment reduced the alanine aminotransferase level by 7.22 U/l, the aspartate aminotransferase level by 7.22 U/l, the alkaline phosphatase level by 25.87 U/l, and the glutamyl transpeptidase level by -5.76 U/l. Lipid profiles: total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were significantly decreased after probiotic treatment. Their overall effects (shown as standard mean difference) were -0.73, -0.54, and -0.36, respectively. Plasma glucose: probiotics reduced the plasma glucose level by 4.45 mg/dl and the insulin level by 0.63. Cytokines: probiotic treatment decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha by 0.62 and leptin by 1.14. Degree of  fat infiltration (DFI): the related risk of probiotics for restoring DFI was .47 (95% confidence interval, 1.61-3.81,  < 0.001).Probiotic treatment or supplementation is a promising therapeutic method for NAFLD.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597206>The characteristics and risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma in non-alcoholic  disease without cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who had non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) without cirrhosis.We prospectively followed NAFLD patients at our University hospital. NAFLD was diagnosed from detection of steatosis by histology or imaging, no alcohol intake, and exclusion of other  diseases. Cirrhosis was defined by histological features, imaging data, and symptoms. We compared NAFLD-related HCC with or without cirrhosis and non-cirrhotic NAFLD with or without HCC.There were 48 non-cirrhotic HCC patients and 71 cirrhotic HCC patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that other than  function factors male gender (OR: 5.603, 95%CI: 1.577-19.900), light drinker (OR: .797, 95%CI: 1.031-7.589), and tumor size (OR: 1.031, 95%CI 1.009-1.055) differ significantly between these two groups. The recurrence rate was significantly lower in the non-cirrhotic HCC group than the cirrhotic HCC group, with risk factors being des-γ-carboxy prothrombin and the number of HCCs. The non-cirrhotic HCC group showed significantly better survival due to absence of non-cancerous  failure. Comparison between non-cirrhotic NAFLD patients with or without HCC (n=612) revealed the following risk factors for HCC: male gender (OR: 7.774, 95%CI: .176-27.775), light drinker (OR: 4.893, 95%CI: 1.923-12.449), and high FIB4-index (OR .634, 95%CI: 1.787-3.884).In patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD, important risk factors for HCC were male gender, alcohol consumption, and the FIB4-index. HCC recurrence and survival were only influenced by the tumor stage. We should be aware of alcohol consumption as a modifiable risk factor for HCC.This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we quantified the expression levels of major drug transporters in healthy, steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)  samples, via liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and used the data to predict the PK of substrate drugs in the disease state. Expression of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) is significantly lower in NASH livers; whereas, MRP3 is induced while no change was observed for organic cation transporter (OCT)1. PBPK models verified with PK data from healthy subjects well recovered the PK in NASH subjects for morphine (involving OCT1) and its glucuronide metabolites (MRP2/MRP3/OATP1B),  TC-mebrofenen (OATP1B/MRP2/MRP3), and rosuvastatin (OATP1B/breast cancer resistance protein).

Although hepatitis B and C viral infections are still the main causes of  cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the introduction of effective antiviral drugs may control or cure them in the near future. In contrast, the burden of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) has been increasing for decades, and 25 to 30% of the general population in Korea is estimated to have NAFLD. Over 10% of NAFLD patients may have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of NAFLD. NASH can progress to cirrhosis and HCC. NASH is currently the second leading cause to be placed on the  transplantation list in the United States. NAFLD is associated with obesity, type  diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. The pathophysiology is complex and associated with lipotoxicity, inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, and insulin resistance. The only proven effective treatment is weight reduction by diet and exercise. However, this may not be effective for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, effective drugs are urgently needed for treating these conditions. Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved for the treatment of NASH. Many pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop new drugs for the treatment of NASH. Some of them are in phase  or 3 clinical trials. Here, pharmacologic therapies in clinical trials, as well as the basic principles of drug therapy, will be reviewed, focusing on pathophysiology.Copyright © 2019 Yeungnam University College of Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584681>Association of Histologic Disease Activity With Progression of Nonalcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>The histologic evolution of the full spectrum of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and factors associated with progression or regression remain to be definitively established.To evaluate the histologic evolution of NAFLD and the factors associated with changes in disease severity over time.A prospective cohort substudy from the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) NAFLD Database study, a noninterventional registry, was performed at 8 university medical research centers. Masked assessment of  histologic specimens was performed, using a prespecified protocol to score individual biopsies. Participants included 446 adults with NAFLD enrolled in the NASH CRN Database studies between October 27, 2004, and September 13, 2013, who underwent   biopsies 1 or more year apart. Data analysis was performed from October 2016 to October 2018.Progression and regression of fibrosis stage, using clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings, including the NAFLD activity score (NAS) (sum of scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning; range, 0-8, with 8 indicating more severe disease).A total of 446 adults (mean [SD] age, 47 [11] years; 294 [65.9%] women) with NAFLD (NAFL, 86 [19.3%]), borderline NASH (84 [18.8%]), and definite NASH (276 [61.9%]) were studied. Over a mean (SD) interval of 4.9 (.8) years between biopsies, NAFL resolved in 11 patients (12.8%) and progressed to steatohepatitis in 36 patients (41.9%). Steatohepatitis resolved in 24 (28.6%) of the patients with borderline NASH and 61 (22.1%) of those with definite NASH. Fibrosis progression or regression by at least 1 stage occurred in 132 (30%) and 151 [34%] participants, respectively. Metabolic syndrome (20 [95%] vs 108 [72%]; P = .03), baseline NAS (mean [SD], 5.0 [1.4] vs 4.3 [1.6]; P = .005), and smaller reduction in NAS (-0. [] vs -0.9 []; P < .001) were associated with progression to advanced (stage 3-4) fibrosis vs those without progression to stage 3 to 4 fibrosis. Fibrosis regression was associated with lower baseline insulin level (20 vs 33 μU/mL; P = .02) and decrease in all NAS components (steatosis grade -0.8 [0.1] vs -0.3 [0.9]; P < .001; lobular inflammation -0.5 [0.8] vs -0. [0.9]; P < .001; ballooning -0.7 [1.1] vs -0.1 [0.9]; P < .001). Only baseline aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were associated with fibrosis regression vs no change and progression vs no change on multivariable regression: baseline AST (regression: conditional odds ratio [cOR], 0.6 per 10 U/L AST; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7; P < .001; progression: cOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5; P = .002). Changes in the AST level, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and NAS were also associated with fibrosis regression and progression (ΔAST level: regression, cOR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6-1.; P = .47; progression, cOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6; P = .02; ΔALT level: regression, cOR, 0.7 per 10 U/L AST; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9; P = .002; progression, cOR, 1.0 per 10 U/L AST; 95% CI, 0.9-1.; P = .93; ΔNAS: regression, cOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9; P = .001; progression, cOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5; P = .01).Improvement or worsening of disease activity may be associated with fibrosis regression or progression, respectively, in NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656024>Potential clinical variants detected in mitochondrial DNA D-loop hypervariable region I of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a mitochondrial disease. However, the underlying role of mitochondrial genetics has not yet been completely elucidated. Evaluation of D-loop nucleotide variations with respect to statistical significance and clinical data distribution.Genomic DNAs were extracted from the peripheral blood samples of patients with biopsy-proven 150 NASH as well as from 150 healthy individuals to explore the functional D-loop region responsible for the replication and transcription of the mitochondrial genome. DNA sequencing by capillary electrophoresis analysis was performed for the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA containing the hypervariable region I, and restriction fragment length polymorphism with MnlI analysis was performed for the m.16189 T/C D-loop variant.The m.A16318C variant was detected only in patients with NASH and approached significance level. Based on clinical data, six variants associated with histological subgroups of NASH and NASH-complicated diseases were identified. In patients with NASH, the m.16129 AA genotype was associated with advanced-stage fibrosis; the m.16249 CC genotype was associated with advanced lobular inflammation and advanced-stage histological steatosis; the m.16296 TT genotype was associated with hypothyroidism; the m.16163 GG and m.16294 TT genotypes were associated with metabolic syndrome; and the m.16256 TT+CT genotypes were associated with type II diabetes. In patients with NASH, microRNAs were estimated by targeting the significant variants identified in this study.These findings suggest that NASH may be associated with D-loop nucleotide variations and that microRNA-based in vitro and/or in vivo studies may be developed by targeting the D-loop variants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587376>Discovery of a role of the novel hepatokine, hepassocin, in obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a public health problem that has raised concerns worldwide and is often associated with hepatic steatosis. Hepassocin is a novel hepatokine that causes hepatic steatosis and induces insulin resistance (IR). However, the role of hepassocin in obesity remains obscure. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between hepassocin levels and obesity. In total, 371 subjects who had a normal weight (NW), were overweight, or were obese were enrolled. We found that hepassocin levels in subjects who were overweight (6,705 ± 1,707 pg/ml) or obese (7,335 ± ,077 pg/ml) were significantly higher than those of subjects with a NW (5,767 ± 1,500 pg/ml) (p < .001, test for trend). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the body-mass index, waist circumference, nonalcoholic  disease, and homeostatic model assessment of IR were independently associated with hepassocin after adjusting for age, sex, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, log triglycerides, alanine transaminase, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate. This study provides evidence that subjects who were overweight or obese had significantly higher hepassocin levels than those with a NW. Hepassocin may be a useful biomarker in managing obesity and its related metabolic dysregulation.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658974>Economic and Clinical Burden of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Patients With Type  Diabetes in the United States.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and is strongly associated with type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients with both T2DM and NASH have increased risk for adverse clinical outcomes, leading to higher risk for mortality and morbidity. We built a Markov model with 1-year cycles and 20-year horizon to estimate the economic burden of NASH with T2DM in the U.S.Cohort size was determined by population size, prevalence of T2DM, and prevalence and incidence of NASH in 2017. The model includes 10 health states: NAFL, NASH-fibrosis stages 0-3, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 year post- transplant, post- transplant, and -related, cardiovascular, and background mortality. Transition probabilities were calculated from meta-analyses and literature. Annual costs for NASH and T2DM were taken from literature and billing codes.We estimated that there were 18. million people in the U.S. living with T2DM and NAFLD, of which 6.4 million had NASH. Twenty-year costs for NAFLD in these patients were $55.8 billion. Over the next 20 years, NASH with T2DM will account for 65,000 transplants, 1.37 million cardiovascular-related deaths, and 812,000 -related deaths.This model predicts significant clinical and economic burden due to NASH with T2DM over the next 20 years. In fact, this burden may be greater since we assumed conservative inputs for our model and did not increase costs or the incidence of T2DM over time. It is highly likely that interventions reducing morbidity and mortality in NASH patients with T2DM could potentially reduce this projected clinical and economic burden.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601342>[Effects of wheat bran fiber on lipid metabolism in ApoE~(-/-) mice].</a></h2><p>To explore the effect and mechanism of wheat bran fiber on lipid metabolism in ApoE~(-/-)mice fed a high fat diet.Twenty 7-week-old male ApoE~(-/-)mice were randomly divided into two groups and fed either a high fat diet as AS model group or a high fat diet adding 0. 8% wheat bran fiber as W-fiber group. And five C57 BL/6 mice with the same genetic background were used as control group.

The aim of this study is to determine whether the SVR is associated with metabolic syndrome (MS) and type  diabetes (T2DM).A total of 798 subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. Lipid profiles, plasma glucose, blood pressure, waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) were grouped by the SVR. The associations between the SVR and T2DM and MS were examined using logistic regression to determine whether the SVR was associated with T2DM and MS.Lipid profiles, glucose levels, blood pressure, WC and BMI showed significant differences when stratified based on the extent of SVR. The SVR levels were also significantly higher in subjects without MS or T2DM than in those with MS or T2DM. The SVR was inversely correlated with lipid profiles and WC and was especially correlated with BMI, with an r>0.5. The SVR was identified as a risk factor for T2DM and MS after adjusting age and sex. SVR can predict T2DM [area under the curve =0.726, 95% CI (0.669-0.782), <0.001] and MS [area under the curve =0.730, 95% CI (0.694-0.766), <0.001].

Clinical characteristics and complications during diagnosis and treatment, changes in blood coagulation,  and kidney function, and postpartum recovery were collected for retrospectively analysis.  54 cases with average gestational age of 35.0±1.7 weeks at third trimester of pregnancy with AFLP were treated. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms were yellow urine, nausea and vomiting. All patients had elevated bilirubin. 90.7% patients had changes in blood coagulation function and 68.5% had elevated serum creatinine. Transaminase levels were dropped rapidly within 1- days after the termination of pregnancy. Total bilirubin recovery was slow and partially recovered after 6-8 days. Serum creatinine and BUN increased slightly after delivery, reaching a peak at 3-4 days and then began to deplete. There was slight change in prothrombin time and fibrinogen after delivery, but returned to normal level after 5-6 days. The most common complications were AKI (74.1%), LF (42.6%), PPH (40.7%) and DIC (33.3%). Twenty-three of the 54 cases (42.6%) progressed to acute  failure.

We aimed to investigate the independent contribution of visceral adipose measured by visceral adiposity index and lipid accumulation product and  fat assessed by  index to the risk of hyperuricemia.We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 1284 participants aged ≥ 40 years old recruited from communities in Zhonglou district, Changzhou. Each participant completed a standard questionnaire, and provided blood samples for biochemical measurements. Visceral adiposity index,  index and lipid accumulation product were calculated by simple anthropometric and functional parameters. Hyperuricemia was defined as serum uric acid ≥ 420 μmol/l for males and ≥ 360 μmol/l for females.The prevalence of hyperuricemia was 15.9% and gradually increased across tertiles of adiposity-based indices. The visceral adipose-based measurements (visceral adiposity index,  index, lipid accumulation product) had better power to discriminate hyperuricemia than body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and neck circumference, and visceral adiposity index exhibited the highest power, with the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.662 (0.636-0.688). Multivariate logistic regression found 1.49-fold, .21-fold and .12-fold increased risk of hyperuricemia with 1-unit increment of visceral adiposity index,  index, and lipid accumulation product, respectively. Compared to tertile 1, the odds ratios of hyperuricemia for the second tertile and the third tertile of visceral adiposity index were 1.57 (1.00-.50) and 3.11 (1.96-4.94), those of  index were 1.64 (1.05-.68) and 3.58 (1.94-6.01), and those of lipid accumulation product were 1.93 (1.19-3.15) and 3.53 (.05-6.09), respectively.

Non-obese and lean individuals were defined as BMI<30kg/m and BMI<25kg/m, respectively.Totally 310 patients were included. Seventy-six individuals (24.5%) had NAFL and 30 patients (9.67%) had non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) among non-obese population. In multivariate regression analysis, only higher BMI was marginally associated with NASH in non-obese compared to those without NASH (Odds ratio: .52, 95% CI: 0.097-6.54; P=0.05). Totally, 246 individuals were lean. 55 individuals (22.3%) had NAFL and 20 individuals (8.%) had NASH in their  biopsies. In univariate analysis, serum triglyceride, cholesterol, LDL, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and uric acid were associated with NAFL among lean individuals (P<0.05). In regression analysis, serum uric acid was associated with NAFL (Odds ratio: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.18-.45; P=0.004) and NASH in lean individuals (Odds ratio: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.27-3.10; P=0.003).NAFLD/NASH is prevalent even in a healthy lean population when evaluated by  biopsy.

It is characterized by accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes associated with lobular inflammation and balonization, which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Thus, a characterization and follow-up of a progression of the fibrosis level of these patients becomes important, being that the transient hepatic elastography is a reliable method for this evaluation with a measure of the kapa index.To evaluate the progression of hepatic fibrosis through elastography in patients with non-alcoholic  disease.Patients who had previously performed hepatic biopsy and noninvasive scores for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis were included in the study. These same subjects were then submitted to current clinical evaluation, laboratory and  elastography tests, defining the level of  fibrosis, about 10 years after the first evaluation.Data were analyzed for 66 patients previously submitted to  biopsy. Of these, 16 were not found, four could not participate because they were debilitated due to hepatic cirrhosis, two had died from an automobile accident and five from complications of cirrhosis of the . Therefore, of the 50 patients with a known history, 9 (18%) had died of cirrhosis or were unable to attend the examination because of their  disease. The remaining population was predominantly female (61.5%), mean age of 63 years, being overweight, dyslipidemia (76.9%), disorders of the glycemic profile (76.9%), and metabolic syndrome (82.1%). Of the 39 cases evaluated, 35% had the same degree of fibrosis at the initial evaluation (biopsy) and at the current evaluation (elastography), 33% had an increase in the degree of fibrosis and another 30% had a decrease in the degree of fibrosis. Twenty-eight patients had NASH at baseline. Regarding these patients, it was observed in the current evaluation, that 25% remained stable in the degree of fibrosis, 39% progressed, and 35% regressed.Despite some limitations of our study, such as the small number of patients, and the use of two different methods of evaluation (biopsy and elastography), the data obtained allow us to conclude that of the 39 evaluated cases, 33% (13) presented progression of fibrosis and the total group of 50 patients, 42% had cirrhosis or died due to  disease.

Saturated  acids induce autophagy dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leading to apoptosis in hepatocytes. However, unsaturated  acids, such as oleic acid, are nontoxic and can even prevent saturated  acid-induced toxicity in vitro. Although emerging evidence has suggested that ER calcium flux disruption in hepatocytes is involved in NAFLD pathogenesis, the roles of  acids in autophagy and ER calcium flux still remain unclear. We demonstrated that oleic acid ameliorated palmitic acid-induced autophagy arrest and ER stress in parallel with ER calcium depletion in hepatocytes. Moreover, we found that the effect of oleic acid against autophagy arrest was reversed by the pharmacological inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA), which influxes calcium to ER. These data suggest that SERCA-mediated ER calcium flux is greatly involved in  acid-induced lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, and the prevention of ER calcium depletion may restore saturated  acid-induced autophagy arrest in hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Primary end-points were serum levels of hepatic enzymes; other parameters of  function, metabolic syndrome and inflammation were secondary end-points. The coagulation-fibrinolysis balance was also thoroughly investigated, as NAFLD is associated with haemostatic alterations, which might contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk of this condition. Study design: double-blind, randomized, multicenter, controlled trial on two parallel groups. Subjects with NAFLD (18-80 years, either sex) received the active or control treatment for three months. All assays were performed before and at the end of supplementation, on 113 total subjects. The hepatic enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase decreased after treatment from 23.% to 3.7%, reaching statistical significance only for AST levels. However, there were no differences between control and active groups. Metabolic and inflammatory variables were unchanged, except for a slight (less than 10%) increase of cholesterol and glucose levels after the active treatment. Coagulation-fibrinolytic parameters were unaffected by either treatment. In conclusion, chronic supplementation with the mixture of dietary compounds was well tolerated and apparently safe in NAFLD subjects. The trial failed to demonstrate any efficacy on relevant physio-pathological markers, but its protocol and results may be useful to design future studies with natural compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562717>Development of Non-alcoholic  Disease (NAFLD) in Young Obese Tribal Subjects of Tripura: Link between Low 25 (OH) Vitamin-D Levels and Immune Modulators.</a></h2><p>There have been many studies conducted so far on Non Alcoholic  Disease (NAFLD) with its many aspects including its association with 25 hydroxy Vitamin D levels and its rather complex interplay with pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-1a (IL-1a), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumour Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin-17a (IL-17a) and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10).

Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats received 20% fructose in drinking water (10 treated with allopurinol and 10 received vehicle) and 10 control rats received tap water. After 14 days, the hepatic response to an acute fructose load was evaluated, and in fasted animals, respirometry studies in freshly isolated mitochondria were performed. In fasting rats, we did not find differences in systemic or hepatic uric acid and triglyceride concentrations among the groups, but mitochondrial respiratory control rate was significantly decreased by high fructose feeding and correlated with a reduced expression of Complex I, as well as decreased aconitase- activity. On the other hand, in fructose fed rats, an acute fructose load increased systemic and hepatic uric acid, triglycerides and oxidative stress. Fructose feeding was also associated with fructokinase and xanthine oxidase overexpression and increased  de novo lipogenesis program ( acid synthase (FAS) and cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C (CIDEC) overexpression, ATP citrate lyase (ACL) and acetyl coA carboxylase (ACC) overactivity and decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation). Allopurinol treatment prevented hepatic and systemic alterations.

While these risk factors have been established for over 40 years, the definition of MetS warrants reconsideration in light of the substantial data that have emerged from studies of the gut microbiome. In this Review we present the existing recent literature that supports the gut microbiome's potential influence on the various risk factors of MetS. The interplay of the intestinal microbiota with host metabolism has been shown to be mediated by a myriad of factors, including a defective gut barrier, bile acid metabolism, antibiotic use, and the pleiotropic effects of microbially produced metabolites. These data show that events that start in the gut, often in response to external cues such as diet and circadian disruption, have far-reaching effects beyond the gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566148>Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is associated with lower presence of non-alcoholic  disease in middle-aged and elderly adults.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet might contribute to managing risk factors of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), but evidence is limited. We examined the association of DASH diet score (DASH-DS) with NAFLD, as well as the intermediary effects of serum retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4), serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum TAG, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and BMI.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a population-based cohort study. Dietary data and lifestyle factors were assessed by face-to-face interviews and the DASH-DS was then calculated. We assessed serum RBP4, hs-CRP and TAG and calculated HOMA-IR. The presence and degree of NAFLD were determined by abdominal sonography.Guangzhou, China.Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study participants, aged 40-75 years at baseline (n 3051).After adjusting for potential covariates, we found an inverse association between DASH-DS and the presence of NAFLD (Ptrend = 0·009). The OR (95 % CI) of NAFLD for quintiles -5 were 0·78 (0·62, 0·98), 0·74 (0·59, 0·94), 0·69 (0·55, 0·86) and 0·77 (0·61, 0·97), respectively. Path analyses indicated that a higher DASH-DS was associated with lower serum RBP4, hs-CRP, TAG, HOMA-IR and BMI, which were positively associated with the degree of NAFLD.Adherence to the DASH diet was independently associated with a marked lower prevalence of NAFLD in Chinese adults, especially in women and those without abdominal obesity, and might be mediated by reducing RBP4, hs-CRP, TAG, HOMA-IR and BMI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633654>Evaluation of Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Early Phase Clinical Trials of Steatohepatitis in Adolescents.</a></h2><p>Early-phase pediatric nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) clinical trials are designed with non-invasive parameters to assess potential efficacy. Increasingly, these parameters include MRI-derived proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and MR elastography (MRE)-derived shear stiffness as biomarkers of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. Understanding fluctuations in these measures is essential for calculating trial sample sizes, interpreting results, and planning clinical drug trials in children with NAFLD. Lack of such data in children comprises a critical knowledge gap. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to assess whole- MRI-PDFF change in adolescents with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) over 12 weeks.Adolescents 12-19 years with biopsy-proven NASH undergoing standard-of-care treatment were enrolled. Baseline and week-12 assessments of anthropometrics, transaminases, MRI-PDFF, and MRE-stiffness were obtained.Fifteen adolescents were included (mean age 15.7 [SD .9] years). Hepatic MRI-PDFF was stable over 12 weeks (mean absolute change -0.8%, p = 0.24). Correlation between baseline and week-12 values of MRI-PDFF was high (ICC = 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 - 0.99). MRE-stiffness was stable (mean percentage change .7%, p = 0.44); correlation between baseline and week-12 values was moderate (ICC = 0.47; 95% CI: 0, 0.79). Changes in weight, BMI, and aminotransferases were not statistically significant.In adolescents with NASH, fluctuations in hepatic MRI-PDFF and MRE-stiffness over 12 weeks of standard-of-care were small. These data on the natural fluctuations in quantitative imaging biomarkers can serve as a reference for interventional trials in pediatric NASH and inform the interpretation and planning of clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30687796>Metabolic profiling of adolescent non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p> Adolescent non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors. The association between adolescent NAFLD and a wide range of metabolic biomarkers is unclear. We have attempted to determine the differences in metabolic profile of adolescents with and without markers of NAFLD.  We performed cross-sectional analyses in a sample of 3,048 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at age 17. We used three indicators of NAFLD: ALT >40 U/l; AST >40 U/l and ultrasound scan-assessed steatosis. Associations between each measure of NAFLD and 154 metabolic traits, assessed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, were analyzed by multivariable linear regression, adjusting for age, sex and BMI.  All three indicators of NAFLD were associated with ~0.5 standard deviation (SD) greater concentrations of all extremely large to small very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) measures. ALT >40U/l was associated with ~0.5SD greater concentrations of very small VLDLs, intermediate-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoproteins. Concentrations of most cholesterols, including remnant cholesterol, all triglycerides and monounsaturated  acids, in addition to glycoprotein acetyls (inflammatory marker), were also higher in participants with NAFLD.  We have identified differing metabolic profiles between adolescents with and without indicators of NAFLD. These results provide the foundations for future research to determine whether these differences persist and result in adverse future cardiometabolic health.Copyright: © 2019 Hartley A et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637181>Effect of Weight Reduction on Histological Activity and Fibrosis of Lean Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Patient.</a></h2><p>Weight reduction has evidenced benefit on attenuation of histological activity and fibrosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but there is scarcity of data for lean NASH subgroup. We have designed this study to compare the effects of weight reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean NASH.We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven NASH patients. BMI < 25 kg/m2 was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second  biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic  disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ 5% weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, 5/6 and /6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean NASH.© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

It was demonstrated that the treatment of cells with different concentrations of apigenin for 24 h significantly decreased the palmitic acid-induced increases in total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels as well as intracellular lipid accumulation. In addition, apigenin increased the phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels but decreased the expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1,  acid synthase, and SREBP- in a concentration-dependent manner.

It has been suggested to lead to chronic inflammation-related diseases such as obesity, type  diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), pancreatitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, it has attracted attention as a target for the prevention and treatment of these chronic diseases. As metabolic endotoxemia was first reported in mice that were fed a high-fat diet, research regarding its relationship with diets has been actively conducted in humans and animals. In this review, we summarize the relationship between fat intake and induction of metabolic endotoxemia, focusing on gut dysbiosis and the influx, kinetics, and metabolism of LPS. We also summarize the recent findings about dietary factors that attenuate metabolic endotoxemia, focusing on the regulation of gut microbiota. We hope that in the future, control of metabolic endotoxemia using dietary factors will help maintain human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660146>Fermented black radish ( L. var. ) attenuates methionine and choline deficient diet-induced nonalcoholic  disease in mice.</a></h2><p>As one of the wide-ranging form of chronic  disease, there are only limited therapeutic options for nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). We evaluated whether fermented black radish ( L. var. ; FBR) ameliorates lipid accumulation, inflammation, and hepatic fibrosis, which are characteristics of the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Fermented black radish treatment reduced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which appeared to be associated with the downregulation of adipogenic transcription factors, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, and lipid accumulation-related genes including adipocyte protein- and  acid synthase. Administration of FBR to C57BL/6J mice challenged with methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet significantly attenuated the increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and triglyceride. In addition, treatment with FBR interestingly repressed the hepatic inflammation induced with MCD diet, by lowering the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and suppressing the inactivation of macrophages and Kupffer cells in the . Fermented black radish was also shown to mitigate  fibrosis through the inhibition of alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor beta-1, and collagen type I alpha 1 chain. Our results indicate that FBR ameliorates NAFLD and its related metabolic disease by regulating multiple pathways, suggesting that FBR may be an effective dietary supplement for ameliorating NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

LHG has been utilized for the treatment of sore throats and hyperglycemia in folk medicine as a homology of medicine and food. The hypoglycemic pharmacology of LHG has attracted considerable attention, and mogrosides have been considered to be active ingredients against diabetes mellitus. We have found that these mogrosides could be metabolized into their secondary glycosides containing 1-3 glucose residues in type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats in previous studies. These metabolites may be the antidiabetic components of LHG in vivo. Thus far, no reports have been found on reducing blood glucose of mogrosides containing 1-3 glucose residues.The aim of this study was to confirm that mogrosides containing 1-3 glucose residues were the active components of LHG for antidiabetic effects and to understand their potential mechanisms of action.First, the special fraction of mogrosides containing 1-3 glucose residues was separated from a 50% ethanol extract of LHG, and the chemical components were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and named low-polar Siraitia grosvenorii glycosides (L-SGgly). Second, the antidiabetic effects of L-SGgly were evaluated by HFD/STZ-induced (high-fat diet and streptozocin) obese T2DM rats by indexing fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), and insulin resistance, and then compared with other fractions in the separation process. The changes in serum lipid levels were also detected. Finally, possible mechanisms of antidiabetic activity of L-SGgly were identified as increasing GLP-1 levels and activating  AMPK in T2DM rats.The chemical analysis of L-SGgly showed that they contain 11-oxomogroside V, mogroside V, mogroside III, mogroside IIE, mogroside IIIA, mogroside IIA, and mogroside IA, respectively. The total content of the mogrosides in L-SGgly was 54.4%, including 15.7% mogroside IIA and 12.6% mogroside IA. L-SGgly showed excellent effects on obese T2DM rats compared with the other fractions of LHG extract, including significantly reducing the levels of FBG (p < 0.001) and modifying insulin resistance (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, they could significantly decrease the content of triglyceride (p < 0.01), total cholesterol (p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.01) and free  acid (p < 0.001) and increase the content of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.001) in serum of T2DM rats. Moreover, L-SGgly can significantly increase (p < 0.01) GLP-1 levels and decrease (p < 0.01) IL-6 levels in T2DM rat serum. AMPK-activating activity in T2DM rats was also upregulated by L-SGgly, but no statistical significance was shown.L-SGgly, fractions separated from LHG extract, were verified to have obvious anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects on T2DM rats. Furthermore, L-SGgly regulated insulin secretion in T2DM rats by increasing GLP-1 levels. These findings provide an explanation for the antidiabetic role of LHG.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
