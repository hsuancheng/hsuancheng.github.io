Endothelial dysfunction induced by tacrolimus is related to both increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX2) and uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-driven superoxide production and Rho-kinase-mediated eNOS inhibition. LC40 treatment prevents all the aortic changes induced by tacrolimus. LC40 restores the imbalance between T-helper 17 (Th17)/regulatory T (Treg) cells induced by tacrolimus in mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen. Tacrolimus-induced gut , that is, it decreases microbial diversity, increases the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio and decreases - and butyrate-producing bacteria, and these effects are prevented by LC40. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from LC40-treated mice to control mice prevents the increase in SBP and the impaired relaxation to acetylcholine induced by tacrolimus.LC40 treatment prevents hypertension and endothelial dysfunction induced by tacrolimus by inhibiting gut . These effects are associated with a reduction in vascular oxidative stress, mainly through NOX2 downregulation and prevention of eNOS uncoupling, and inflammation possibly because of decreased Th17 and increased Treg cells polarization in mesenteric lymph nodes.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study was designed to evaluate whether gut microbial composition affects hypertension. 16S rRNA genes obtained from cecal samples of Dahl salt-sensitive (S) and Dahl salt-resistant (R) rats were sequenced. Bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes were higher in the S rats compared with the R rats. Furthermore, the family S24-7 of the phylum Bacteroidetes and the family Veillonellaceae of the phylum Firmicutes were higher in the S rats compared with the R rats. Analyses of the various phylogenetic groups of cecal  revealed significant differences between S and R rats. Both strains were maintained on a high-salt diet, administered antibiotics for ablation of , transplanted with S or R rat cecal contents, and monitored for blood pressure (BP). Systolic BP of the R rats remained unaltered irrespective of S or R rat cecal . Surprisingly, compared with the S rats given S rat cecal content, systolic BP of the S rats given a single bolus of cecal content from R rats was consistently and significantly elevated during the rest of their life, and they had a shorter lifespan. A lower level of  bacteria of the family Veillonellaceae and increased plasma  and heptanoate were features associated with the increased BP observed in the S rats given R rat  compared with the S rats given S rat . These data demonstrate a link between microbial content and BP regulation and, because the S and R rats differ in their genomic composition, provide the necessary basis to further examine the relationship between the host genome and microbiome in the context of BP regulation in the Dahl rats.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29983136>Early intervention with faecal microbiota transplantation: an effective means to improve growth performance and the intestinal development of suckling piglets.</a></h2><p>Recent studies indicate that early postnatal period is a critical window for gut microbiota manipulation to optimise the immunity and body growth. This study investigated the effects of maternal faecal microbiota orally administered to neonatal piglets after birth on growth performance, selected microbial populations, intestinal permeability and the development of intestinal mucosal immune system. In total, 12 litters of crossbred newborn piglets were selected in this study. Litter size was standardised to 10 piglets. On day 1, 10 piglets in each litter were randomly allotted to the faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and control groups. Piglets in the FMT group were orally administrated with 2ml faecal suspension of their nursing sow per day from the age of 1 to 3 days; piglets in the control group were treated with the same dose of a placebo (0.1M potassium phosphate buffer containing 10% glycerol (vol/vol)) inoculant. The experiment lasted 21 days. On days 7, 14 and 21, plasma and faecal samples were collected for the analysis of growth-related hormones and cytokines in plasma and lipocalin-2, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), selected microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in faeces. Faecal microbiota transplantation increased the average daily gain of piglets during week 3 and the whole experiment period. Compared with the control group, the FMT group had increased concentrations of plasma growth hormone and IGF-1 on days 14 and 21. Faecal microbiota transplantation also reduced the incidence of diarrhoea during weeks 1 and 3 and plasma concentrations of zonulin, endotoxin and diamine oxidase activities in piglets on days 7 and 14. The populations of Lactobacillus spp. and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and the concentrations of faecal and plasma , butyrate and total SCFAs in FMT group were higher than those in the control group on day 21. Moreover, the FMT piglets have higher concentrations of plasma transforming growth factor-β and immunoglobulin G, and faecal sIgA than the control piglets on day 21. These findings indicate that early intervention with maternal faecal microbiota improves growth performance, decreases intestinal permeability, stimulates sIgA secretion, and modulates gut microbiota composition and metabolism in suckling piglets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153805>Changes in microbiota composition, bile and fatty acid metabolism, in successful faecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridioides difficile infection.</a></h2><p>Alteration of the gut microbiota by repeated antibiotic treatment increases susceptibility to Clostridioides difficile infection. Faecal microbiota transplantation from donors with a normal microbiota effectively treats C. difficile infection.The study involved 10 patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, nine of whom received transplants from individual donors and one who received a donor unit from a stool bank (OpenBiome).All individuals demonstrated enduring post-transplant resolution of C. difficile- associated diarrhoea. Faecal microbiota diversity of recipients significantly increased, and the composition of the microbiota resembled that of the donor. Patients with C. difficile infection exhibited significantly lower faecal levels of secondary/ bile acids and higher levels of primary bile acids. Levels of secondary bile acids were restored in all transplant recipients, but to a lower degree with the OpenBiome transplant. The abundance increased of bacterial genera known from previous studies to confer resistance to growth and germination of C. difficile. These were significantly negatively associated with primary bile acid levels and positively related with secondary bile acid levels. Although reduced levels of the short chain fatty acids, butyrate, propionate and , have been previously reported, here we report elevations in SCFA, pyruvic and lactic fatty acids, saturated, ω-6, monounsaturated, ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in C. difficile infection. This potentially indicates one or a combination of increased dietary FA intake, microbial modification of FAs or epithelial cell damage and inflammatory cell recruitment. No reversion to donor FA profile occurred post-FMT but ω-3 to ω-6 PUFA ratios were altered in the direction of the donor. Archaeal metabolism genes were found in some samples post FMT.A consistent metabolic signature was identified in the post-transplant microbiota, with reduced primary bile acids and substantial restoration of secondary bile acid production capacity. Total FA levels were unchanged but the ratio of inflammatory to non-inflammatory FAs decreased.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490117>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension: Gut  as the Mediator?</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases. It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut , OSA and gut , and whether gut  is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central.

This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut . Gut , however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut  seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension.

These areas are also crucial for the pathophysiology of and repair after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the role of the gut  in the context of MI remains to be fully elucidated.To investigate the effects of gut  on cardiac repair after MI, C57BL/6J mice were treated with antibiotics 7 days before MI to deplete mouse gut . Flow cytometry was applied to examine the changes in immune cell composition in the heart. 16S rDNA sequencing was conducted as a readout for changes in gut microbial composition. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) species altered after antibiotic treatment were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography.  reconstitution,  of monocytes, or dietary SCFA or Lactobacillus probiotic supplementation was conducted to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of  on the mice after MI.Antibiotic-treated mice displayed drastic, dose-dependent mortality after MI. We observed an association between the gut  depletion and significant reductions in the proportion of myeloid cells and SCFAs, more specifically , butyrate, and propionate. Infiltration of CX3CR1+ monocytes to the peri-infarct zone after MI was also reduced, suggesting impairment of repair after MI. Accordingly, the physiological status and survival of mice were significantly improved after  reconstitution,  of monocytes, or dietary SCFA supplementation. MI was associated with a reorganization of the gut microbial community such as a reduction in Lactobacillus. Supplementing antibiotic-treated mice with a Lactobacillus probiotic before MI restored myeloid cell proportions, yielded cardioprotective effects, and shifted the balance of SCFAs toward propionate.Gut -derived SCFAs play an important role in maintaining host immune composition and repair capacity after MI. This suggests that manipulation of these elements may provide opportunities to modulate pathological outcome after MI and indeed human health and disease as a whole.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29654837>Restoration of short chain fatty acid and bile acid metabolism following    in patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.</a></h2><p>A significant proportion of individuals develop recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) following initial disease.    (FMT), a highly effective treatment method for recurrent CDI, has been demonstrated to induce  recovery. One of the proposed functions associated with restoration of colonization resistance against C. difficile has been recovery of bile acid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to assess recovery of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in addition to bile acids alongside microbial community structure in six patients with recurrent CDI following treatment with FMT over time. Using 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing, we observed marked similarity of the  between recipients following FMT (n = 6, sampling up to 6 months post-FMT) and their respective donors. Sustained increases in the levels of the SCFAs butyrate, , and propionate were observed post-FMT, and variable recovery over time was observed in the secondary bile acids deoxycholate and lithocholate. To correlate these changes with specific microbial taxa at an individual level, we applied a generalized estimating equation approach to model metabolite concentrations with the presence of specific members of the . Metabolites that increased following FMT were associated with bacteria classified within the Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and unclassified Clostridiales families. In contrast, members of these taxa were inversely associated with primary bile acids.

It is well established that psoriasis and IBD have high concordance rates, and similar changes in immune cells and  composition have been reported in both conditions. To study this connection, we used a combination murine model of psoriatic dermatitis and colitis in which mice were treated topically with the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ) and fed dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).We applied IMQ topically to B6 mice (IMQ mice) and subsequently fed them 2% DSS in their drinking water. Disease activity and immune cell phenotypes were analyzed, and the microbial composition of fecal samples was investigated using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. We transplanted feces from IMQ mice to germ-free IQI/Jic (IQI) mice and fed them DSS to assess the effect of the gut  on disease.We first confirmed that IMQ mice showed accelerated DSS colitis. IMQ mice had decreased numbers of IgD and IgM B cells and increased numbers of non-cytokine-producing macrophages in the gut. Moreover, the gut microbiomes of IMQ mice were perturbed, with significant reductions of  and  populations. Germ-free mice transplanted with feces from IMQ mice, but not with feces from untreated mice, also developed exacerbated DSS colitis.These results suggest that skin inflammation may contribute to pathogenic conditions in the gut via immunologic and microbiological changes. Our finding of a novel potential skin-gut interaction provides new insights into the coincidence of psoriasis and IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29211757>Distinct  and oral  composition in human type 1 diabetes, an observational study.</a></h2><p>Environmental factors driving the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) are still largely unknown.

However, observational evidence on SCFA and  and oral  in adults with longstanding T1D vs healthy controls (HC) is lacking.We included 53 T1D patients without complications or medication and 50 HC matched for age, sex and BMI. Oral and  ,  and plasma SCFA levels, markers of intestinal inflammation ( IgA and calprotectin) and markers of low-grade systemic inflammation were measured.Oral  were markedly different in T1D (eg abundance of Streptococci) compared to HC.  analysis showed decreased butyrate producing species in T1D and less butyryl-CoA transferase genes. Also, plasma levels of  and propionate were lower in T1D, with similar  SCFA. Finally,  strains Christensenella and Subdoligranulum correlated with glycemic control, inflammatory parameters and SCFA.We conclude that T1D patients harbor a different amount of intestinal SCFA (butyrate) producers and different plasma  and propionate levels.

While mechanisms of benefit are poorly understood, most models rely on the viability of transplanted microbes. We hypothesised that protocols commonly used in the preparation of faecal  will substantially reduce the number, diversity and functional potential of viable microbes.Stools from eight screened donors were processed under strict anaerobic conditions, in ambient air, and freeze-thawed. Propidium monoazide (PMA) sample treatment was combined with quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis to define the viable  composition and functional potential.Approximately 50% of bacterial content of stool processed immediately under strict anaerobic conditions was non-viable. Homogenisation in ambient air or freeze-thaw reduced viability to 19% and 23% respectively. Processing of samples in ambient air resulted in up to 12-fold reductions in the abundance of important commensal taxa, including the highly butyrogenic species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Subdoligranulum variable, and Eubacterium hallii. The adverse impact of atmospheric oxygen exposure on the capacity of the transplanted  to support SCFA biosynthesis was demonstrated by significantly reduced butyrate and  production by faecal slurries processed in ambient air. In contrast, while reducing overall levels of viable bacteria, freeze-thaw did not significantly alter viable  composition.The practice of preparing material for faecal  in ambient air profoundly affects viable microbial content, disproportionately reducing the abundance of anaerobic commensals and the capacity for biosynthesis of important anti-inflammatory metabolites.

Growing evidence suggests that the microbiota plays a role in the occurrence and evolution of this disease, namely through the production of bioactive metabolites.Omics technologies (metagenomic, metabolomic, and phenomic data) allow providing a robust prediction of steatosis. More than just correlations, causative effects of certain bacterial metabolites have been evidenced in vitro and in rodent models. Butyrate has been shown to be a potent metabolic and inflammatory modulator in the liver. Several aromatic amino-acids such as phenylacetic acid, imidazole propionate, and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate have been identified as potential inducers of steatosis and hepatic inflammation, whereas indolic compounds (indole and indole-3-) seem to preserve liver integrity. Current clinical trials aim at evaluating the efficacy of novel approaches (functional foods, prebiotic and probiotics, and fecal microbial transplants).The microbiota brings new hopes in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

The gut microbiota/gut hormone axis has recently received increasing attention. However, the relationship between the gut microbiota and melatonin receptors has not yet been evaluated. We aimed to determine the effect of the gut microbiota on colonic melatonin receptor expression in germ-free (GF) rats and to further explore the potential mechanism in Caco-2 cells.

Colon tissue was collected for immunohistochemical analysis. The correlations between melatonin receptor expression and the gut microbiota were assessed. Melatonin receptor expression in Caco-2 cells was detected by Western blot. We found that fecal microbiota transplantation significantly increased the expression of colonic melatonin receptors in GF rats. The amount of fecal Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was significantly higher in fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) rats than in GF rats. SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Alistipes and Blautia, were positively correlated with colonic melatonin receptor expression in FMT rats.

Gut microbes were shown to degrade organophosphates and cause intestinal dysfunction. The diabetogenic nature of organophosphates was recently reported but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. We aimed to understand the role of gut  in organophosphate-induced hyperglycemia and to unravel the molecular mechanism behind this process.Here we demonstrate a high prevalence of diabetes among people directly exposed to organophosphates in rural India (n = 3080). Correlation and linear regression analysis reveal a strong association between plasma organophosphate residues and HbA1c but no association with acetylcholine esterase was noticed. Chronic treatment of mice with organophosphate for 180 days confirms the induction of glucose intolerance with no significant change in acetylcholine esterase. Further   and culture  experiments confirm the involvement of gut  in organophosphate-induced glucose intolerance. Intestinal metatranscriptomic and host metabolomic analyses reveal that gut microbial organophosphate degradation produces short chain fatty acids like acetic acid, which induces gluconeogenesis and thereby accounts for glucose intolerance. Plasma organophosphate residues are positively correlated with  esterase activity and  level of human diabetes.Collectively, our results implicate gluconeogenesis as the key mechanism behind organophosphate-induced hyperglycemia, mediated by the organophosphate-degrading potential of gut .

A causal relation relationship between gut , inflammation, and atherosclerosis has not been explored previously.Here, we investigated whether a proinflammatory  from Caspase1 ( Casp1) mice accelerates atherogenesis in Ldlr mice.We treated female Ldlr mice with antibiotics and subsequently transplanted them with fecal  from Casp1 mice based on a cohousing approach. Autologous transplantation of fecal  of Ldlr mice served as control. Mice were cohoused for 8 or 13 weeks and fed chow or high-fat cholesterol-rich diet. Fecal samples were collected, and factors related to inflammation, metabolism, intestinal health, and atherosclerotic phenotypes were measured. Unweighted Unifrac distances of 16S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) sequences confirmed the introduction of the Casp1 and Ldlr  into Ldlr mice (referred to as Ldlr( Casp1) or Ldlr( Ldlr) mice). Analysis of atherosclerotic lesion size in the aortic root demonstrated a significant 29% increase in plaque size in 13-week high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) mice compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. We found increased numbers of circulating monocytes and neutrophils and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels in plasma in high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. Neutrophil accumulation in the aortic root of Ldlr( Casp1) mice was enhanced compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. 16S-rDNA-encoding sequence analysis in feces identified a significant reduction in the short-chain fatty acid-producing taxonomies Akkermansia, Christensenellaceae, Clostridium, and Odoribacter in Ldlr( Casp1) mice.

Dietary fibers, i.e. prebiotics, are fermented by human gut microbiota into the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) , propionate, and butyrate. SCFAs promote fat oxidation and improve metabolic health. Therefore, the prebiotic inulin might be an effective dietary strategy to improve human metabolism. We aimed to investigate the acute metabolic effects of ingesting inulin compared with digestible carbohydrates and to trace inulin-derived SCFAs using stable isotope tracer methodology.In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design, 14 healthy, overweight to obese men consumed a high-fat milkshake containing A) 24 g inulin of which 0.5 g was U-C-inulin (INU) or B) 24 g maltodextrin placebo (PLA), with a wash-out period of at least five days. Fat oxidation was measured via an open-circuit ventilated hood and blood samples were collected up to 7 h after ingestion. Plasma, breath, and fecal samples were collected, and appetite and satiety scores were assessed.Fat oxidation increased in the early postprandial phase (0-3 h), and both plasma glucose and insulin were lower after INU ingestion compared with PLA (all P < 0.05). Plasma free fatty acids were higher in the early, and lower in the late postprandial period after INU ingestion. Inulin was fermented into SCFAs as indicated by higher plasma  concentrations after INU compared with PLA (P < 0.05). In addition, we found continuous increases in plasma C-SCFA enrichments (P < 0.05 from t = 120 onwards) and breath CO enrichments after INU intake. There were no effects on plasma triglycerides, free glycerol, satiety hormones GLP-1 and PYY, and appetite and satiety scores.Ingestion of the prebiotic inulin improves fat oxidation and promotes SCFA production in overweight to obese men. Overall, replacing digestible carbohydrates with the fermentable inulin may favor human substrate metabolism.The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov under number .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
