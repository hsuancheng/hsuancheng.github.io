The effects of these compounds on the proliferation of different human  cell lines, viz., FaDu (pharynx carcinoma), A2780 (ovarian carcinoma), HT29 ( adenocarcinoma), and A375 (malignant melanoma), have been evaluated. Thus, KBA homodimer 21 effectively inhibited the growth of FaDu, A2780, HT29, and A375 cells with EC values below 9 μM. In addition, compounds 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, and 17 also exhibited cytotoxic effects for A2780, HT29, and A375  cells. In particular, the pyrazine analog 8 was highly cytotoxic for A375  cells with an EC value of 2.1 μM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647155>The comparative study of acetyl- (AKBA) and aspirin in the prevention of intestinal adenomatous polyposis in APC(Min/+) mice.</a></h2><p>Acetyl-11-keto-beta-BA (AKBA), a component of the gum resin of Boswellia serrata, has been recognized as a promising agent for the prevention of intestinal tumorigenesis. Aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has also been considered to have the activity against intestinal tumorigenesis. However, the prevention of   is insufficient and no definitive recommendation has been made for clinic use. Herein, we compared the efficacy of AKBA with that of aspirin in an adenomatous polyposis coli intestinal neoplasia consecutive weeks. Mice were sacrificed by anesthetizing. The whole intestine was removed from each mouse. The number, size and histopathology of intestinal adenomatous polyps were examined under microscopy. The adenomatous polyps were removed for further analysis by the assays of western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. AKBA significantly prevented the formation of intestinal adenomatous polyps without toxicity to mice. Statistical analysis indicated that AKBA's activity both in the prevention of small intestinal and  polyps was more potently than aspirin. Histopathologic examination revealed that AKBA's effect, that is the reduction of polyp size and degree of dysplasia, was more prominent in larger sized polyps, especially those originating in . These effects of AKBA were associated with its role in the induction of apoptosis in carcinomas. The assays of western blotting and immunohistochemistry staining indicated that the efficacy of AKBA might arise from its activity in the modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and NF-κB/COX-2 pathway in adenomatous polyps. Conclusion, AKBA by oral application prevented intestinal tumorigenesis more potential than aspirin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21056033>A propionyloxy derivative of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells mediated through topoisomerase I & II inhibition.</a></h2><p>Boswellic acids have invariably been reported for their antiproliferative potential in various cell systems. In the present study the growth inhibitory effect of propionyloxy derivative of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (PKBA; a semisynthetic analogue of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid) on HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells is being reported for the first time. In the preliminary studies, in vitro cytotoxicity of PKBA was investigated against eight human  cell lines viz., IMR-32, SF-295 (both neuroblastoma), PC-3 (prostate), Colo-205 (), MCF-7 (breast), OVCAR-5 (ovary), HL-60, Molt-4 (both leukemia) and their respective IC(50) values were found to be 5.95, 7.11, 15.2, 14.5, 15, 15.9, 8.7 & 9.5μg/ml, respectively. For determining the mechanism of cell death in HL-60 cells, PKBA was subjected to different mechanistic studies. DNA relaxation assay of PKBA revealed inhibition of both topoisomerases I & II. The fragmentation analysis of DNA revealed typical ladders indicating the cytotoxic effect to be mediated by induction of apoptosis. The morphologic studies of PKBA showed the presence of true apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis was confirmed further by flow-cytometric detection of sub-G(1) peaks and enhanced annexin-V-FITC binding of the cells. The activation of apoptotic cascade by PKBA in HL-60 cells was found to be associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of initiator and executioner caspases and cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). In vivo studies of PKBA revealed anti-tumoral activity against both ascitic and solid murine tumor models. These studies thus demonstrate PKBA to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells due to the inhibition of topoisomerases I and II.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Whether the apoptotic effects of boswellic acid could be affected by inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway was examined. HT29 cells were treated with 3-acetyl- AKBA in the absence and presence of LY294002 or Wortmanin, inhibitors of PI3K. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and caspase assay. The activation of Akt was examined by Western blot.AKBA at 30 microM only slightly induced apoptosis. Preincubation of the cells with LY294002 or wortmannin significantly enhanced the AKBA-induced apoptosis up to 20-fold. Further study showed that at the doses used, AKBA induced phosphorylation of Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308 positions, indicating an activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.AKBA may activate the PI3K/Akt pathway and inhibition of the PI3K pathway significantly enhances AKBA-induced apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21406118>Antistaphylococcal and biofilm inhibitory activities of acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid from Boswellia serrata.</a></h2><p>Boswellic acids are pentacyclic triterpenes, which are produced in plants belonging to the genus Boswellia. Boswellic acids appear in the resin exudates of the plant and it makes up 25-35% of the resin. β-boswellic acid, 11-keto-β-boswellic acid and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid have been implicated in apoptosis of  cells, particularly that of brain tumors and cells affected by leukemia or . These molecules are also associated with potent antimicrobial activities. The present study describes the antimicrobial activities of boswellic acid molecules against 112 pathogenic bacterial isolates including ATCC strains. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), which exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity, was further evaluated in time kill studies, postantibiotic effect (PAE) and biofilm susceptibility assay. The mechanism of action of AKBA was investigated by propidium iodide uptake, leakage of 260 and 280 nm absorbing material assays.AKBA was found to be the most active compound showing an MIC range of 2-8 μg/ml against the entire gram positive bacterial pathogens tested. It exhibited concentration dependent killing of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 up to 8 × MIC and also demonstrated postantibiotic effect (PAE) of 4.8 h at 2 × MIC. Furthermore, AKBA inhibited the formation of biofilms generated by S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and also reduced the preformed biofilms by these bacteria. Increased uptake of propidium iodide and leakage of 260 and 280 nm absorbing material by AKBA treated cells of S aureus indicating that the antibacterial mode of action of AKBA probably occurred via disruption of microbial membrane structure.This study supported the potential use of AKBA in treating S. aureus infections. AKBA can be further exploited to evolve potential lead compounds in the discovery of new anti-Gram-positive and anti-biofilm agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23132636>Chemoprevention of intestinal adenomatous polyposis by acetyl- in APC(Min/+) mice.</a></h2><p>Acetyl- (AKBA) is a derivative of boswellic acid, which is an active component of the gum resin of Boswellia serrata. AKBA has been used as an adjuvant medication for treatment of inflammatory diseases. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of AKBA as a chemopreventive agent against intestinal adenomatous polyposis in the adenomatous polyposis coli multiple intestinal neoplasia (APC(Min/+) ) mouse model. APC(Min/+) mice were administered AKBA by p.o. gavage for 8 consecutive weeks. The mice were sacrificed and the number, size and histopathology of intestinal polyps were examined by light microscopy. AKBA decreased polyp numbers by 48.9% in the small intestine and 60.4% in the . An even greater AKBA effect was observed in preventing the malignant progression of these polyps. The number of large (>3 cm)  polyposis was reduced by 77.8%. Histopathologic analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of dysplastic cells and in the degree of dysplasia in each polyp after AKBA treatment. There was no evidence of high grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma in any of the polyps examined within the treated group. More interestingly, interdigitated normal appearing intestinal villi were observed in the polyps of the treated group. During the course of the study, AKBA was well tolerated by the mice with no obvious signs of toxicity. Results from immunohistochemical staining, Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that the chemopreventive effect of AKBA was attributed to a collection of activities including antiproliferation, apoptosis induction, antiangiogenesis and anti-inflammation. AKBA was found to exert its chemopreventive action through the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB/cyclooxygenase-2 signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that AKBA could be a promising regimen in chemoprevention against intestinal tumorigenesis.Copyright © 2012 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171201>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid suppresses docetaxel-resistant prostate  cells in vitro and in vivo by blocking Akt and Stat3 signaling, thus suppressing chemoresistant stem cell-like properties.</a></h2><p>Acquired docetaxel-resistance of prostate  (PCa) remains a clinical obstacle due to the lack of effective therapies. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a pentacyclic triterpenic acid isolated from the fragrant gum resin of the Boswellia serrata tree, which has shown intriguing antitumor activity against human cell lines established from PCa, , malignant glioma, and leukemia. In this study, we examined the effects of AKBA against docetaxel-resistant PCa in vitro and in vivo as well as its anticancer mechanisms. We showed that AKBA dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in docetaxel-resistant PC3/Doc cells; its IC value in anti-proliferation was ∼17 μM. Furthermore, AKBA dose-dependently suppressed the chemoresistant stem cell-like properties of PC3/Doc cells, evidenced by significant decrease in the ability of mammosphere formation and down-regulated expression of a number of stemness-associated genes. The activation of Akt and Stat3 signaling pathways was remarkably enhanced in PC3/Doc cells, which contributed to their chemoresistant stem-like phenotype. AKBA (10-30 μM) dose-dependently suppressed the activation of Akt and Stat3 signaling pathways in PC3/Doc cells. In contrast, overexpression of Akt and Stat3 significantly attenuated the inhibition of AKBA on PC3/Doc cell proliferation. In docetaxel-resistant PCa homograft mice, treatment with AKBA significantly suppresses the growth of homograft RM-1/Doc, equivalent to its human PC3/Doc, but did not decrease their body weight. In summary, we demonstrate that AKBA inhibits the growth inhibition of docetaxel-resistant PCa cells in vitro and in vivo via blocking Akt and Stat3 signaling, thus suppressing their  stem cell-like properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23850473>Acetyl- (AKBA) prevents human  adenocarcinoma growth through modulation of multiple signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Acetyl- (AKBA) is a derivative of boswellic acid. We have previously reported that AKBA can reduce the number and size of  adenomatous polyps in the APC(Min/+) mouse model. In this study, we evaluated the effect of AKBA on human  adenocarcinoma growth. Its efficacy and toxicity were compared with those of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin.The inhibition of  cell growth was estimated by colorimetric and clonogenic assay. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by the flow cytometry assay. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and JC-1 fluorescence probe assays were performed to determine the apoptotic cells. Further experiment was carried out in mice with HT-29 xenografts. AKBA was orally administered for 24days. The HT-29 xenografts were removed for TUNEL staining and western blotting analysis. Blood was obtained for clinical chemical analysis, and samples of organs were sectioned for microscopic assessment.AKBA significantly inhibited human  adenocarcinoma growth, showing arrest of the cell cycle in G1-phase and induction of apoptosis. AKBA administration in mice effectively delayed the growth of HT-29 xenografts without signs of toxicity. The activity of AKBA was more potent than that of aspirin. Western blotting suggested that this activity may arise from its multiple effects on the activation of apoptotic proteins, suppression of inflammatory cytokines and modulation of EGFR and ATM/P53 signaling pathways in the HT-29 xenografts.AKBA prevents the growth of  adenocarcinoma through modulation of multiple signaling pathways.AKBA could be a promising agent in the prevention of  adenocarcinomas.© 2013.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30084990>Chemoprevention of inflammation-related colorectal  by silymarin-, acetyl--, curcumin- and maltodextrin-enriched dietetic formulation in animal model.</a></h2><p>On the basis of preliminary in vitro experience, we assessed whether an enriched nutritional formulation with estrogen receptor (ER)-beta agonist and anti-inflammatory properties may prevent inflammation-associated colorectal  (CRC) in an animal model. Study sample enclosed 110 C57BL/6J male mice. Forty underwent dietary supplement safety assessment (20 standard diet and 20 enriched formulation). Seventy were treated with azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium and divided into two groups: 35 received standard diet and 35 enriched formulation (curcumin, boswellic acids, silymarin and maltodextrins). Miniature colonoscopy demonstrated colitis and solid lesion development in five mice/group 100 days after first AOM injection. Mice were killed after 10 days. In each group, four subgroups received intraperitoneal bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injection at 24th/48th/72nd/96th hour before killing. Anti-inflammatory effect and chemoprevention were evaluated by lesion number/size, histological inflammation/dysplasia/neoplasia assessment, pro-inflammatory cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA), ER-beta/ER-alpha/BrdU immunohistochemistry and TUNEL immunofluorescence. Standard formulation assumption was associated with  shortening compared with enriched one (P = 0.04), which reduced solid lesion number and size (P < 0.001 for both), histological inflammation score (P = 0.04), pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression (P < 0.001), number of low-grade dysplasia (LGD; P = 0.03) and high-grade dysplasia (P < 0.001) areas. CRC was observed in 69.6% in standard and 23.5% in enriched formulation assuming animals (P < 0.001). Enriched formulation induced lower ER-alpha expression in CRC (P < 0.001) and higher ER-beta expression in LGD (P < 0.001) being associated to higher epithelial turnover (BrdU; P<0.001) in normal mucosa and increased apoptosis in LGD and CRC (P < 0.001 for both). Our results are promising for a successful anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive effect of enriched formulation in CRC arising from inflamed tissue.</p></html>
