We used standardized batch incubations and the Mucosal-Simulator of the Human Microbial Intestinal Ecosystem (M-SHIME) to show the in vitro luminal and mucosal effects of the main PUFA in the Western diet, linoleic acid (LA). High concentrations of LA were found to decrease butyrate production and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii numbers dependent on LA biohydrogenation to  (VA) and stearic acid (SA). In faecal batch incubations, LA biohydrogenation and butyrate production were positively correlated and SA did not inhibit butyrate production. In the M-SHIME, addition of a mucosal environment stimulated biohydrogenation to SA and protected F. prausnitzii from inhibition by LA. This was probably due to the preference of two biohydrogenating genera Roseburia and Pseudobutyrivibrio for the mucosal niche. Co-culture batch incubations using Roseburia hominis and F. prausnitzii validated these observations. Correlations networks further uncovered the central role of Roseburia and Pseudobutyrivibrio in protecting luminal and mucosal SHIME microbiota from LA-induced stress. Our results confirm how cross-shielding interactions provide resilience to the microbiome and demonstrate the importance of biohydrogenating, mucosal bacteria for recovery from LA stress.© 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28246442>Effects of different vegetable oils on rumen fermentation and conjugated linoleic acid concentration .</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of different vegetable oils on rumen fermentation and concentrations of beneficial -9 -11 C18:2 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and -11 C18:1  acid (FA) in the rumen fluid in an  condition.Six vegetable oils including sunflower, soybean, sesame, rice bran, groundnut, and mustard oils were used at three dose levels (0%, 3% and 4% of substrate dry matter [DM] basis) in three replicates for each treatment in a completely randomized design using 6 × 3 factorial arrangement. Rumen fluid for microbial culture was collected from four goats fed on a diet of concentrate mixture and berseem hay at a ratio of 60:40 on DM basis. The  fermentation was performed in 100 ml conical flakes containing 50 ml of culture media and 0.5 g of substrates containing 0%, 3% and 4% vegetable oils.Oils supplementation did not affect (p>0.05)  DM digestibility, and concentrations of total  FAs and ammonia-N. Sunflower oil and soybean oil decreased (p<0.05) protozoal numbers with increasing levels of oils. Other oils had less pronounced effect (p>0.05) on protozoal numbers. Both -11 C18:1 FA and -9, -11 CLA concentrations were increased (p<0.05) by sunflower and soybean oil supplementation at 4% level with the highest concentration observed for sunflower oil. The addition of other oils did not significantly (p>0.05) increase the -11 C18:1 FA and -9, -11 CLA concentrations as compared to the control. The concentrations of stearic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic  were not altered (p>0.05) due to the addition of any vegetable oils.Supplementation of sunflower and soybean oils enhanced beneficial -11 C18:1 FA and -9, -11 CLA concentrations in rumen fluid, while sesame, rice bran, groundnut, and mustard oils were ineffective in this study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25704679>Differentiation of geographical origin of cream products in Poland according to their  acid profile.</a></h1><p> acid (FA) composition of bovine milk fat from cream samples, originating from three regions of Poland (one mountainous and two lowland ones) and collected within 2 years, was analysed aiming at identifying the region of production by applying principal component analysis (PCA). From the 44 FAs identified by gas chromatography, two groups were discerned: seasonally variable (n=17) and non-seasonal (n=7). The biplots showed that different FAs could serve as markers of geographical origin of cream samples. The CLA, , C18:39c12c15c, total C18:1 trans and C18:39c12c15c n-6 (GLA) were found indicative of mountainous regions, and the short-chain saturated FAs (; C4:0-C11:0) - of the lowland ones. The Opole province was characterised by a high content of linoleic acid. It was concluded that the origin of a cream sample could be fairly well identified by gas chromatography combined with chemometric analysis of milk fat FAs.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Eighteen Comisana ewes at 122±6 d in milking were allotted into 3 experimental groups. Diets were characterized by chopped grass hay administered ad libitum and by 800 g/head and day of 3 experimental concentrates containing 84.5 g of soybean oil/kg of dry matter (DM) and 52.8 g/kg of DM of bentonite (control diet), chestnut tannin extract (CHT diet), or quebracho tannin extract (QUE diet). The trial lasted 4 wk. Milk yield was recorded daily, and milk composition and blood parameters were analyzed weekly. At the end of the experiment, samples of rumen fluid were collected to analyze pH,   acid profile, and the relative proportions of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus in the rumen microbial population. Hepatic functionality, milk yield, and gross composition were not affected by tannin extracts, whereas milk FA composition was characterized by significant changes in the concentration of linoleic acid (CHT +2.77% and QUE +9.23%),  (CHT +7.07% and QUE +13.88%), rumenic acid (CHT -1.88% and QUE +24.24%), stearic acid (CHT + 8.71% and QUE -11.45%), and saturated   (CHT -0.47% and QUE -3.38%). These differences were probably due to the ability of condensed versus hydrolyzable tannins to interfere with rumen microbial metabolism, as indirectly confirmed by changes in the relative proportions of B. fibrisolvens and B. proteoclasticus populations and by changes in the molar proportions of . The effect of the CHT diet on the milk FA profile and microbial species considered in this trial was intermediate between that of QUE and the control diet, suggesting a differential effect of condensed and hydrolyzable tannins on rumen microbes. Compared with control animals, the presence of B. fibrisolvens increased about 3 times in ewes fed CHT and about 5 times in animals fed QUE. In contrast, the abundance of B. proteoclasticus decreased about 5- and 15-fold in rumen liquor of ewes fed CHT and QUE diets, respectively. The use of soybean oil and a practical dose of QUE or CHT extract in the diet of dairy ewes can be an efficient strategy to improve the nutritional quality of milk.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Twelve dairy cows (90 ± 22 d in milk, 523 ± 88 kg of body weight, 7,908 ± 719 kg of milk production in the previous lactation) were housed in individual tiestalls and assigned to treatments according to a 3 × 3 Latin square design replicated 4 times. Treatments were 100% TMR (T100), 75% TMR plus 25% FF (T75), and 50% TMR plus 50% FF (T50). The experiment lasted 60 d, divided into 3 periods of 20 d each; the first 12 d of each period were used for diet adaptation and the last 8 d for data collection. The TMR (18.1% crude protein, 24.6% acid detergent fiber) and FF (Lolium multiflorum; 15.1% crude protein, 24.1% acid detergent fiber) were prepared and cut daily and offered to each cow individually. The highest DMI was reached in T100 and T75, which was reflected in greater intake of the different nutrients than T50. No differences were detected in the apparent total digestibility of the nutrients, mean ruminal pH, and total   acid concentrations among treatments. Cows in T50 resulted in the lowest ruminal N-NH concentration and the lowest microbial N flow to the duodenum. Milk yield was 8.5% higher from cows in T100 and T75 compared with T50, but we observed no differences for milk fat or milk protein yield among treatments. Milk fat of cows fed T50 had 8% more unsaturated   (FA) than that of cows fed T100, mostly because of a higher content of monounsaturated FA. Additionally, cows in T50 had a higher concentration of linoleic acid, , and rumenic acid than T100. Meanwhile, the concentration of linoleic acid and  in cows fed T75 was higher than T100. The milk fat of the cows fed T50 and T75 had a lower n-6:n-3 ratio than T100. We concluded that including up to 29% of FF in the total DMI in combination with a TMR did not affect the intake or digestion of nutrients or the productive response in dairy cows and resulted in a higher concentration of desirable FA from a consumer's perspective.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The body's inability to store zinc necessarily requires a constant dietary supply to avoid alteration of physiological functions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary enrichment with zinc on chemical-nutritional and aromatic properties of milk and cheese. Thirty commercial dairy cows, balanced for parity, milk production, and days in milk, were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The control group was fed with a conventional complete diet (22 kg of dry matter/animal per day), whereas the experimental group received a daily zinc supplementation of 60 mg per kg of dry complete feed. During the experimental period, the milk yield was monitored and samples of milk and caciotta cheese were collected to obtain information about the chemical-nutritional composition and aromatic profile. Dietary zinc integration did not influence milk yield and composition, but induced a marked reduction of somatic cell count and improved the oxidative stability of ripened caciotta cheese. In both milk and cheese, the experimental group samples were characterized by a lower concentration of saturated   and an increase in oleic acid, , and rumenic acid. The aromatic profile of dairy products was also positively affected by dietary zinc intake, with an increase in concentration of carboxylic , aldehydes, and esters. The present results suggest a positive role of zinc in improving animal health and nutraceutical properties of milk and corresponding cheese. Taking into account the analysis of  compounds, zinc dietary supplementation of dairy cows should contribute to the production of cheeses with interesting organoleptic properties, although more studies are necessary to confirm the consumer acceptability of these changes.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Therefore, the formation of fermentation end-products which might exert chemopreventive effects regarding colon cancer was investigated after an in vitro simulated digestion and fermentation of nuts using human fecal microbiota.Fermentation supernatants (FS) and pellets (FP) were obtained after an in vitro fermentation of hazelnuts, almonds, macadamia, pistachios and walnuts. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids (BA) in FS as well as fatty acids in FP were analyzed via gas chromatography. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in FS were determined photometrically.Fermentation of nuts resulted in 1.9- to 2.8-fold higher concentrations of SCFA compared to the control and a shift of molar ratios toward butyrate production. In vitro fermentation resulted in the formation of  (C18:1t11, 32.1 ± 3.2 % FAME; fatty acid methyl ester) and conjugated linoleic acid (c9,t11 CLA, 2.4 ± 0.7 % FAME) exclusively in fermented walnut samples. Concentrations of secondary BA deoxycholic-/iso-deoxycholic acid (6.8-24.1-fold/4.9-10.9-fold, respectively) and levels of MDA (1.3-fold) were significantly reduced in fermented nut samples compared to the control.This is the first study that demonstrates the ability of the human fecal microbiota to convert polyunsaturated fatty acids from walnuts to c9,t11 CLA as a potential chemopreventive metabolite. In addition, the production of butyrate and reduction in potential carcinogens such as secondary BA and lipid peroxidation products might contribute to the protective effects of nuts regarding colon cancer development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26268669>Influence of calcium chloride in the high temperature acetification by strain Acetobacter aceti WK for vinegar.</a></h1><p>To improve the thermotolerant properties (TTP) of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) cells for high temperature acetification.At high temperature (36 ± 1°C), the acetification rate (ETA) is usually lower than at 30 ± 1°C. The addition of 0·15% calcium chloride (CaCl2 ) may decrease the negative effect of the increase of temperature from 30 ± 1°C to 36 ± 1°C on the ETA. The effect of CaCl2 on the thermotolerant properties of acetic acid bacteria cells was investigated. The CaCl2 increased the content of phospholipids (phosphotidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol),   (cis-, palmitic acid and myristic acid) and the activities of membrane-bound enzymes involved in acetification, alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Transmission electron microscope images revealed a more compact cell wall with CaCl2. Process consistency at 36 ± 1°C was tested in nine sequential acetification cycles using 0·15% (w/v) CaCl2. High ETAs (9·33 ± 0·6; 8·67 ± 0·8 and 9·67 ± 0·7 g l(-1) day(-1)) were obtained during the last three cycles.The results confirm that changes of the content of lipid, activities of membrane-bound enzymes and cell-wall thickness occurred with added CaCl2.High temperature acetification (HTA) with additions of CaCl2 was investigated.

This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of RO and flaxseed oil (FO) supplementation on nutrients digestibility, rumen fermentation parameters and rumen FA profile of dairy cows. Forty-eight mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to one of four treatments for 8 weeks, including basal diet (CON) or the basal dietary supplemented with 4% RO, 4% FO or 2% RO plus 2% FO on a DM basis. Compared with CON, dietary oil supplementation improved the total tract apparent digestibility of DM, neutral detergent fibre and ether extracts ( P 0.05), whereas oil groups significantly changed the   acid (VFA) profile by increasing the proportion of propionate whilst decreasing total VFA concentration, the proportion of acetate and the ratio of acetate to propionate ( P 0.05). In addition, dietary oil supplementation increased the total unsaturated FA proportion in the rumen by enhancing the proportion of trans-11 C18:1  (VA), cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) ( P &lt; 0.05).

Twenty-four crossbred Boer goats were assigned to 3 dietary treatments: L0 (control), L10 and L20 containing 0, 10%, or 20% whole linseed, respectively. The ruminal pH and concentration of total  (VFA) were not affected by dietary treatments. The feeding of L10 and L20 diets produced higher ( < 0.05) molar proportions of acetate and lower ( < 0.05) molar proportions of butyrate and valerate than the L0 diet. Molar proportions of myristic acid (C14:0) and palmitic acid (C16:0) were lower ( < 0.05) in the rumen of goats offered L10 and L20 diets than the control diet. However, stearic acid (C18:0),  (C18:1 trans-11), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA, C18:2 trans-10, cis-12) and α-lenolenic acid (C18:3 n-3) were higher ( < 0.05) in the rumen of goats fed L10 and L20 than L0.

CLAs (free fatty acid form of CLA [CLA-FFA], nano-encapsulated CLA-FFA, triglyceride form of CLA [CLA-TG], and nano-encapsulated CLA-TG) were used in the in vitro fermentation experiments. When Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (B. fibrisolvens) was incubated with CLA-FFAs, the concentrations of cis-9, trans-11 CLA and  (VA) slightly was decreased and increased by nano-encapsulation, respectively. When B. fibrisolvens was incubated with CLA-TG, the concentrations of cis-9, trans-11 CLA and VA decreased, but these were increased when B. fibrisolvens was incubated with nano-encapsulated CLA-TG. The nano-encapsulation was more effective against the in vitro biohydrogenation activity of B.fibrisolvens incubated with CLA-FFA than with CLA-TG. In the in vitro ruminal incubation test, the total gas production and concentration of total volatile fatty acids incubated with nano-encapsulated CLA-FFA and CLA-TG were increased significantly after 24 h incubation (p<0.05). Nano-encapsulated CLA-FFA might, thus, improve the ruminal fermentation characteristics without adverse effects on the incubation process. In addition, nano-encapsulated CLA-FFA increased the population of Fibrobacter succinogenes and decreased the population of B. fibrisolvens population. These results indicate that nano-encapsulation could be applied to enhance CLA levels in ruminants by increasing the stability of CLA without causing adverse effects on ruminal fermentation.</p></html>
