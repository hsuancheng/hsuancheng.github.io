In the brain, the death of activated microglia by apoptosis has been proposed as one mechanism to resolve brain . How microglial death is regulated after activation is still unclear. We reported that exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin (IL)-13 together initially activates and then kills rat microglia in culture by a mechanism dependent on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We show here that activation of the E prostanoid receptor 2 (EP2, PTGER2) for prostaglandin E2 mediates microglial death induced by LPS/IL-13, and that EP2 activation by agonist alone kills microglia. Both EP2 antagonists and reactive oxygen scavengers block microglial death induced by either LPS/IL-13 or EP2 activation. By contrast, the homeostatic induction of heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) by LPS/IL-13 or EP2 activation protects microglia. Both the Hmox1 inducer cobalt protoporphyrin and a compound that releases the Hmox1 product carbon monoxide (CO) attenuated microglial death produced by LPS/IL-13. Whereas CO reduced COX-2 protein expression, EP2 activation increased Hmox1 and COX-2 expression at both the mRNA and protein level. Interestingly, caspase-1 inhibition prevented microglial death induced by either LPS/IL-13 or low (but not high) concentrations of , suggestive of a predominantly pyroptotic mode of death.  also caused the expression of activated caspase-3 in microglia, pointing to apoptosis. These results indicate that EP2 activation, which initially promotes microglial activation, later causes delayed death of activated microglia, potentially contributing to the resolution phase of neuroinflammation.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29272001>Investigation on the regulatory effect of PGE2 on ESCC cells through the trans-activation of EGFR by EP2 and the relevant mechanism.</a></h2><p>To determine whether the combination of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and EP2, the subtype receptor of PGE2, could trans-activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).In this experiment, we selected epithelial cells from normal esophageal mucosa as the negative control group, and the ESCC EC109 and TE-1 cell strain as the observation group. Real-time PCR and Western-blotting were used to detect the expression of EP2, EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR). The pre-treatment of ESCC cell strains was carried out using  (special agonist of PGE2 and EP2) and RNAi of EP2, and we observed the expression of EP2, EGFR, and p-EGFR. WST-8 (CCK-8) was applied for the detection of the cell proliferation rate. The transwell invasion experiment was conducted for the detection of the invasion capability of cells. The expression of MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) in the cell supernatant were detected using ELISA.The high mRNA and protein expression of EP2, EGFR, and p-EGFR were found in the EC109 and TE-1 cell strains in the observation group, which were higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05). After the intervention of PGE2, EP2 expression was decreased and the p-EGFR expression was increased (p < 0.05). There was no variation found in the expression of EGFR (p > 0.05). After cells were intervened using , the expressions of EP2 and p-EGFR were increased (p < 0.05), and there were no changes identified in the expression of EGFR (p > 0.05). After the intervention of RNAi, the expression of EP2 and p-EGFR was decreased (p < .05), and no changes were identified in the expression of EGFR (p > 0.05). After the intervention of PGE2 and , great increases were seen in the cell proliferation rate, invasion capability, and the expression of MMP-9, VEGF, IL-6, and TNF-α in EC109 and TE-1 cell strains (p < 0.05), however, the intervention of RNAi could reduce above indexes (p < 0.05).Through cell experiments, we verified that the combination of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and EP2, the subtype receptor of PGE2, could trans-activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to regulate the proliferation and invasion capability of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells, and secrete and express multiple cytokines, thus discovering the pathological mechanism of  to carcinoma transition in the occurrence of ESCC, and providing the experimental evidence for the search of new target in the treatment of ESCC. ESCC cells can highly express the receptor subtype EP2 of PGE2 that can transactivate the EGFR, through which PGE2 is involved in the transition mechanism from  to cancer.</p></html>
