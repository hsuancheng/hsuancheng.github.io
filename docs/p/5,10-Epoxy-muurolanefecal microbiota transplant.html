Faecal   (FMT) has been proposed as a new strategy to promote decolonization in order to reduce the risk of superinfection due to these ARB. This paper discusses the literature on the use of FMT for this indication, and the improvement levers available to promote its efficacy.Literature available to date concerning the use of FMT to eradicate ARB was reviewed, and the different factors that may have influenced the efficacy of decolonization were evaluated.Four axes that could have played major roles in the efficacy of FMT were identified: bowel preparation before FMT; donor; dose; and thermal conditioning of faeces. The positive or negative impact of each on the outcome of FMT is discussed.Although FMT is very efficient for the eradication of Clostridium difficile, the same 'recipe' cannot be used for the eradication of ARB. Working together with expert centres may help to improve the efficacy of FMT for this indication, and enable the reduction of in-hospital isolation precautions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

We sought to characterize the effects of  fluorouracil (5FU) chemotherapy on colon inflammation and functional measures in colorectal cancer (CRC) and to further determine whether gut  can influence this response. 50 C57BL/6 were randomized into four groups; Control + Vehicle (n = 10), Control + 5FU (n = 10), AOM/DSS + Vehicle (n = 15), and AOM/DSS + 5FU (n = 15). CRC was induced chemically by a single 10 mg/kg injection of azoxymethane (AOM) followed by two cycles (2% and 1%) of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Mice were then treated with 3 cycles of vehicle or 5FU (cycle 1: 40 mg/kg, cycle 2 + 3: 20 mg/kg). Functional tests (grip strength and run-to-fatigue) were performed prior to 5FU treatment (baseline) and at the completion of the second cycle of 5FU. Following the third 5FU cycle, mice were euthanized and the colon was evaluated for expression of inflammatory genes using RT-qPCR and stool samples were profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing. A second experiment used    from 5FU treated mice to control mice (n = 10-15/group) to determine whether 5FU associated changes in the  could influence functional measures and colon inflammation. 5FU reduced grip strength (p < 0.05) and caused a trending decrease in run-to-fatigue performance in cancer mice (p = 0.06). Select intestinal inflammatory genes were significantly elevated with 5FU treatment and this was further exacerbated with cancer (p < 0.05).  analysis revealed increased dissimilarity and alterations in bacterial taxonomy in 5FU and AOM/DSS-treated mice (p < 0.05).   from 5FU treated mice reduced functional performance (p < 0.05) and altered select colon inflammatory markers (p < 0.05). This study provides evidence of an effect of 5FU on inflammatory responses and functional measures in a mouse model of CRC and suggests that gut microbes may play a role in some, but not all, 5FU related perturbations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this work was to determine the safety, tolerability, and impact on mucosal/stool  and brain function in HE after capsular FMT in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in Virginia. Patients with cirrhosis with recurrent HE with MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) <17 on SOC were randomized 1:1 into receiving 15 FMT capsules versus placebo from a single donor enriched in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. Endoscopies with duodenal and sigmoid biopsies, stool analysis, cognition, serum lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and duodenal antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression at baseline were used. Clinical follow-up with SOC maintenance was performed until  months. FMT-assigned patients underwent repeat endoscopies 4 weeks postenrollment. Twenty subjects on lactulose/rifaximin were randomized 1:1. MELD score was similar at baseline (9.6 vs. 10.2) and study end (10.2 vs. 10.). Six patients in the placebo group required hospitalizations compared to 1 in FMT, which was deemed unrelated to FMT. Infection/HE episodes were similar between groups. Baseline microbial diversity was similar in all tissues between groups. Post-FMT, duodenal mucosal diversity (P = 0.01) increased with higher Ruminococcaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae and lower Streptococcaceae and Veillonellaceae. Reduction in Veillonellaceae were noted post-FMT in sigmoid (P = 0.04) and stool (P = 0.05). Duodenal E-cadherin (P = 0.03) and defensin alpha  (P = 0.03) increased whereas interleukin-6 (P = 0.02) and serum LBP (P = 0.009) reduced post-FMT. EncephalApp performance improved post-FMT only (P = 0.02). Conclusion: In this phase 1 study, oral FMT capsules are safe and well tolerated in patients with cirrhosis and recurrent HE. FMT was associated with improved duodenal mucosal diversity, dysbiosis, and AMP expression, reduced LBP, and improved EncephalApp performance.

In this review article, we will discuss evolution of clinical trials in IBD over the last 3- years.Recognizing limitations intrinsic to clinical disease activity indices in IBD, regulatory authorities have recommended evaluating co-primary endpoints of patient-reported outcomes and endoscopic disease activity in clinical trials. Biomarker-enriched trial enrolment and central endoscopy reading have emerged as critical events in trial recruitment and outcome assessment and have driven placebo response rates down. While trials of novel biologic therapies and advanced small molecules continue at an accelerated pace, pragmatic comparative efficacy trials of treatment strategy aimed at optimizing current therapies (such as early combined immunosuppression [REACT], tight disease control [CALM], therapeutic drug monitoring [TAXIT, TAILORIX]) have directly informed clinical practice. With emphasis on value-based care and population health management, multi-pronged remote monitoring, self-management, and telemedicine approaches in the era of smartphones have re-emerged with promise. Non-conventional therapies such as   , though still experimental, have provided insight into disease pathogenesis and offered hope for microbial manipulation strategies for treating these complex diseases. Clinical trials have rapidly evolved over the last  years not only focusing on novel therapies but also optimizing existing treatment approaches and population health management. Over the next decade, these trials will continue to advance the field, and be readily translatable into clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29743453>[Future perspectives on   ].</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906449>Effect of    on experimental colitis in mice.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of    (FMT) on the acute inflammatory response in a murine model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and to delineate the putative underlying mechanism(s). Mice were divided into four groups, namely the normal control, DSS, -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) and FMT group. Mice in the DSS, -ASA and FMT groups were orally administered 3% DSS (w/v) solution for 7 days to induce colitis. On days 1, 3,  and 7, mice in the DSS, -ASA and FMT groups were respectively administered 0.% carboxymethylcellulose sodium, -ASA suspension and  suspension by enema. The disease activity index of each mouse was calculated on a daily basis. All mice were sacrificed on day 8, and the length of their colons was measured. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-10 in the colon tissues of each group were also measured. Compared with that in the DSS group, FMT ameliorated the severity of inflammation due to ulcerative colitis in mice, which was accompanied by a significantly decreased MPO activity, reduced levels of TNF-α and IL-1β, and an increased level of IL-10 in colon tissue (all P<0.05). Taken together, these results demonstrated that FMT exerted a therapeutic effect on experimental colitis in mice, and the associated mechanism is likely to involve the remodeling of the intestinal flora and regulation of intestinal T-cell immunity homeostasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31204202>Cryopreservation of the human gut : Current state and perspectives.</a></h1><p>The human intestinal  is a complex ecosystem that consists of thousands of bacterial species that are responsible for human health and disease. The intestinal  is a natural resource for production of therapeutic and preventive medicals, such as probiotics and  . Modern lifestyles have resulted in the extinction of evolutionally selected microbial populations upon exposure to environmental factors. Therefore, it is very important to preserve the human gut  to have the opportunity for timely restoration with minimal safety risks. Cryopreservation techniques that are suitable for the preservation of viable, mixed microbial communities and a biobanking approach are currently under development in different countries. However, the number of studies in this area is very limited. The variety of morphological and physiological characteristics of microbes in the , the different cryopreservation goals, and the criteria for the evaluation of cryopreservation effectiveness are the main challenges in the creation of a universal and standardized cryopreservation protocol. In this review, we summarized the current progress of the main cryopreservation techniques for gut  communities and the methods for the assessment of the effectiveness of these techniques in the context of practical application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

In the last decade, the frequency and severity of C. difficile infection has been increasing worldwide to become one of the most common hospital-acquired infections. Transmission of this pathogen occurs by the -oral route and the most important risk factors include antibiotic therapy, old age, and hospital or nursing home stay. The clinical picture is diverse and ranges from asymptomatic carrier status, through various degrees of diarrhea, to the most severe, life threatening colitis resulting with death. Diagnosis is based on direct detection of C. difficile toxins in , most commonly with the use of EIA assay, but no single test is suitable as a stand-alone test confirming CDI. Antibiotics of choice are vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole, though metronidazole is considered as inferior. The goal of this review is to update physicians on current scientific knowledge of C. difficile infection, focusing also on    which is a promising therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29771153>Nature-derived  exposure as a novel immunomodulatory approach.</a></h1><p>Current attempts to modulate the human  and immune responses are based on probiotics or human-derived bacterial .

Qualified donor-derived stools were collected and injected to the AC infants  a rectal tube. Clinical outcomes and follow-up observations were noted. Stools were collected from ten AC infants before and after FMT, and GM composition was assessed for infants and donors using 16S rDNA sequencing analysis.After FMT treatment, AC symptoms in 17 infants were relieved within 2 d, and no relapse was observed in the next 15 mo. Clinical improvement was also detected in the other two AC infants who were lost to follow-up. During follow-up, one AC infant suffered from mild eczema and recovered shortly after hormone therapy. Based on the 16S rDNA analysis in ten AC infants, most of them ( = 6) had greater GM diversity after FMT. As a result, Proteobacteria decreased ( = 6) and Firmicutes increased ( = 10) in post-FMT AC infants. Moreover, Firmicutes accounted for the greatest proportion of GM in the patients.

A persistent burden of this infectious illness has been demonstrated over the past 4 years at Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre (WDGMC), Johannesburg, South Africa, through implementation of active surveillance of hospital-acquired infections as part of the infection prevention and control programme. Oral treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin is recommended, but there is a major problem with symptomatic recurrence after treatment. Replacement of normal flora by the administration of donor stool through colonoscopy or nasogastric/duodenal routes is becoming increasingly popular.To identify risk factors for the development of CDAD in patients referred for faecal   (FMT) and evaluate the safety of administration of donor stool as an outpatient procedure, including via the nasogastric route.A retrospective record review of patients with recurrent CDAD referred for FMT at WDGMC between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016 was conducted.Twenty-seven patients were identified, all of whom fulfilled the criteria for recurrent CDAD. One-third were aged &gt;65 years, and the majority were female. The most common risk factors were prior exposure to antibiotics or proton-pump inhibitors and underlying inflammatory bowel disease. Three procedures were carried out as inpatients and 24 in the outpatient gastroenterology unit. At 4-week follow-up, all patients reported clinical resolution of their diarrhoea after a single treatment and there were no recurrences. The FMT procedure was associated with no morbidity (with particular reference to the risk of aspiration when administered via the nasogastric route) or mortality.This case series confirms that FMT is a safe and effective therapy for recurrent CDAD. In most cases it can be administered via the nasogastric route in the outpatient department. We propose that the recently published South African Gastroenterology Society guidelines be reviewed with regard to recommendations for the route of administration of FMT and hospital admission. Meticulous prescription practice by clinicians practising in hospitals and outpatient settings, with particular attention to antimicrobials and chronic medication, is urgently required to prevent this debilitating and potentially life-threatening condition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29124041>Alteration of Gut  and Inflammatory Cytokine/Chemokine Profiles in -Fluorouracil Induced Intestinal Mucositis.</a></h1><p>Disturbed homeostasis of gut  has been suggested to be closely associated with -fluorouracil (-Fu) induced mucositis. However, current knowledge of the overall profiles of -Fu-disturbed gut  is limited, and so far there is no direct convincing evidence proving the causality between -Fu-disturbed  and colonic mucositis. In mice, in agreement with previous reports, -Fu resulted in severe colonic mucositis indicated by weight loss, diarrhea, bloody stool, shortened colon, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. It significantly changed the profiles of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in serum and colon. Adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and VE-Cadherin were increased. While tight junction protein occludin was reduced, however, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) were increased in colonic tissues of -Fu treated mice. Meanwhile, inflammation related signaling pathways including NF-κB and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPKs) in the colon were activated. Further study disclosed that -Fu diminished bacterial community richness and diversity, leading to the relative lower abundance of Firmicutes and decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio in  and cecum contents. -Fu also reduced the proportion of Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria, and Candidate division TM7, but increased that of Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria in  and/or cecum contents. The   from healthy mice prevented body weight loss and colon shortening of -Fu treated mice. In addition, the   from -Fu treated mice reduced body weight and colon length of vancomycin-pretreated mice. Taken together, our study demonstrated that gut  was actively involved in the pathological process of -Fu induced intestinal mucositis, suggesting potential attenuation of -Fu induced intestinal mucositis by manipulating gut  homeostasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557953>Impact of    on Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome-A Systematic Review.</a></h1><p>   (FMT) is a gut microbial-modulation strategy that has been investigated for the treatment of a variety of human diseases, including obesity-associated metabolic disorders. This study appraises current literature and provides an overview of the effectiveness and limitations of FMT as a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS). Five electronic databases and two gray literature sources were searched up to 10 December 2018. All interventional and observational studies that contained information on the relevant population (adult patients with obesity and MS), intervention (receiving allogeneic FMT) and outcomes (metabolic parameters) were eligible. From 1096 unique citations, three randomized placebo-controlled studies (76 patients with obesity and MS, body mass index = 34.8 ± 4.1 kg/m, fasting plasma glucose = .8 ± 0.7 mmol/L) were included for review. Studies reported mixed results with regards to improvement in metabolic parameters. Two studies reported improved peripheral insulin sensitivity (rate of glucose disappearance, RD) at 6 weeks in patients receiving donor FMT versus patients receiving the placebo control. In addition, one study observed lower HbA1c levels in FMT patients at 6 weeks. No differences in fasting plasma glucose, hepatic insulin sensitivity, body mass index (BMI), or cholesterol markers were observed between two groups across all included studies. While promising, the influence of FMT on long-term clinical endpoints needs to be further explored. Future studies are also required to better understand the mechanisms through which changes in gut microbial ecology and engraftment of  affect metabolic outcomes for patients with obesity and MS.

SourceTracker, a Bayesian, OTU-based algorithm, indicated that 59.3 ± 3.0% of the  bacterial communities in treated mice were attributable to the donor source. This overall degree of  engraftment was similar in mice conditioned with antibiotics and germ-free mice.

We investigated its role in the burden of carotid atherosclerosis, measured by ultrasound as total plaque area.Multiple regression with traditional risk factors was used to identify three phenotypes among 316/3056 patients attending vascular prevention clinics. Residual score (RES; i.e. the distance off the regression line, similar to standard deviation) was used to identify the % of patients with much less plaque than predicted by their risk factors (Protected, RES <-2), the 90% with about as much plaque as predicted (Explained, RES -2 to 2), and the % with much more plaque than predicted (Unexplained RES >2). Metabolic products of the intestinal microbiome that accumulate in renal failure - gut-derived uremic toxins (GDUT) - were assayed in plasma by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Plasma levels of trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO), p-cresyl sulfate, p-cresyl glucuronide, and phenylacetylglutamine were significantly lower among patients with the Protected phenotype, and higher in those with the Unexplained phenotype, despite no significant differences in renal function or in dietary intake of nutrient precursors of GDUT. In linear multiple regression with a broad panel of risk factors, TMAO (p = 0.011) and p-cresyl sulfate (p = 0.011) were significant independent predictors of carotid plaque burden.The intestinal microbiome appears to play an important role in atherosclerosis.

However, in 12% of patients treated with FMT, CDI recurs within one month. Zinc deficiency predicts increased diarrheal frequency in malnourished children, but little is known about its association with FMT outcome. We hypothesized that zinc levels were an independent predictor of CDI recurrence after FMT.We performed a retrospective cohort study of 80 patients (mean age, 66; 59 women) receiving FMT for CDI from 9/2013-9/2016 at a tertiary care center. Zinc levels were measured within 90 days before FMT. The primary outcome was CDI recurrence within 90 days after FMT. We controlled for risk factors for FMT failure using Cox regression. We also analyzed the effect of zinc supplementation in individuals with deficiency.Forty-nine subjects had a normal zinc level, and 31 had a low level (<0.66 g/mL). CDI recurred in 3/49 (6%) patients with normal zinc and /31 (16%) patients with low zinc (HR = 11.327, 95% CI = 2.162-59.336, =0.004).

Prospective tracking of all patients receiving FMT between July 1, 2015, and February 1, 2017, was conducted using REDCap™ electronic data capture system. According to the FMTP, indications for FMT included (a) three or more CDI recurrences, (b) two or more hospital admissions with severe CDI, or (c) first episode of complicated CDI (CCDI). Risk factors for initial infection and for treatment failure were assessed. Patients were followed for at least 3 months to monitor for cure/failure, relapse, and side effects. Frozen 250 mL FMT samples were acquired from OpenBiome (Somerville, MA, USA). After 4 h of thawing, the liquid suspension was applied using colonoscopy, beginning with terminal ileum and proceeding distally toward mid-transverse colon. Monitored clinical parameters included disease severity (Hines VA CDI Severity Score or HVCSS), concomitant medications, number of FMT treatments, non-FMT therapies, cure rates, and mortality. Descriptive statistics were utilized to outline the study results.A total of 35 patients (mean age 58. years, 69% female) were analyzed, with FMT-attributable primary cure achieved in 30/35 (86%) cases. Within this subgroup, 2/30 (6.7%) patients recurred and were subsequently cured with long-term oral vancomycin. Among five primary FMT failures (14% total sample), 3 (60%) achieved medical cure with long-term oral vancomycin therapy and 2 (40%) required colectomy. For the seven patients who either failed FMT or recurred, long-term vancomycin therapy was curative in all but two cases. For patients with severe CDI (HVCSS ≥3), primary and overall cure rates were 6/10 (60%) and 8/10 (80%), respectively. Patients with CCDI ( = 4) had higher HVCSS (4 vs. 3) and a mortality of 25%. Characteristics of patients who failed initial FMT included older age (70 vs. 57 years), female sex (80% vs. 67%), severe CDI (80% vs. 13%), and active opioid use during the initial infection (60% vs. 37%) and at the time of FMT (60% vs. 27%). The most commonly reported side effect of FMT was loose stools.This pilot study supports the efficacy and safety of FMT administration for CDI in the setting of a community-based university hospital. Following FMTP implementation, primary (86%) and overall (94%) nonsurgical cure rates were similar to those reported in other studies. The potential role of opioids as a modulator of CDI warrants further clinical investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29925252>Potential Role of the Gut Microbiome in ALS: A Systematic Review.</a></h1><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) etiology and pathophysiology are not well understood. Recent data suggest that dysbiosis of gut  may contribute to ALS etiology and progression. This review aims to explore evidence of associations between gut  and ALS etiology and pathophysiology. Databases were searched for publications relevant to the gut microbiome in ALS. Three publications provided primary evidence of changes in microbiome profiles in ALS. An ALS mouse model revealed damaged tight junction structure and increased permeability in the intestine versus controls along with a shifted microbiome profile, including decreased levels of butyrate-producing bacteria. In a subsequent publication, again using an ALS mouse model, researchers showed that dietary supplementation with butyrate relieved symptoms and lengthened both time to onset of weight loss and survival time. In a small study of ALS patients and healthy controls, investigators also found decreased levels of butyrate-producing bacteria. Essential for maintaining gut barrier integrity, butyrate is the preferred energy source of intestinal epithelial cells. Ten other articles were reviews and commentaries providing indirect support for a role of gut  in ALS pathophysiology. Thus, these studies provide a modicum of evidence implicating gut  in ALS disease, although more research is needed to confirm the connection and determine pathophysiologic mechanisms. Nurses caring for these patients need to understand the gut microbiome and its potential role in ALS in order to effectively counsel patients and their families about emerging therapies (e.g., prebiotics, probiotics, and  microbial ) and their off-label uses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463339>Cost-Effectiveness of Competing Treatment Strategies for Clostridium difficile Infection: A Systematic Review.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) presents a substantial economic burden and is associated with significant morbidity. While multiple treatment strategies have been evaluated, a cost-effective management strategy remains unclear. OBJECTIVE We conducted a systematic review to assess cost-effectiveness analyses of CDI treatment and to summarize key issues for clinicians and policy makers to consider. METHODS We searched PubMed and  other databases from inception to August 2016. These searches were not limited by study design or language of publication. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, abstracted data, and assessed methodological quality using the Drummond and Jefferson checklist. We extracted data on study characteristics, type of CDI, treatment characteristics, and model structure and inputs. RESULTS We included 14 studies, and 13 of these were from high-income countries. More than 90% of these studies were deemed moderate-to-high or high quality. Overall, 6 studies used a decision-tree model and 7 studies used a Markov model. Cost of therapy, time horizon, treatment cure rates, and recurrence rates were common influential factors in the study results. For initial CDI, fidaxomicin was a more cost-effective therapy than metronidazole or vancomycin in 2 of 3 studies. For severe initial CDI, 2 of 3 studies found fidaxomicin to be the most cost-effective therapy. For recurrent CDI, fidaxomicin was cost-effective in 3 of  studies, while    (FMT) by colonoscopy was consistently cost-effective in 4 of 4 studies. CONCLUSIONS The cost-effectiveness of fidaxomicin compared with other pharmacologic therapies was not definitive for either initial or recurrent CDI. Despite its high cost, FMT by colonoscopy may be a cost-effective therapy for recurrent CDI. A consensus on model design and assumptions are necessary for future comparison of CDI treatment.

More recently it has also been shown to be associated with ocular diseases. In the present study, the association of gut microbiome dysbiosis with bacterial Keratitis, an inflammatory eye disease which significantly contributes to corneal blindness, was investigated. Bacterial and fungal gut microbiomes were analysed using  samples of healthy controls (HC, n = 21) and bacterial Keratitis patients (BK, n = 19). An increase in abundance of several antiinflammatory organisms including  and  and members of  and  was observed in HC compared to BK patients in the bacterial microbiome. In the fungal microbiome, a decrease in the abundance of  and  and an increase in the abundance of pathogenic fungi  and  were observed in BK patients compared to HC. In addition, heatmaps, PCoA plots and inferred functional profiles also indicated significant variations between the HC and BK microbiomes, which strongly suggest dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of BK patients. This is the first study demonstrating the association of gut microbiome with the pathophysiology of BK and thus supports the gut-eye axis hypothesis. Considering that Keratitis affects about 1 million people annually across the globe, the data could be the basis for developing alternate strategies for treatment like use of probiotics or   to restore the healthy microbiome as a treatment protocol for Keratitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463925>Impact of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate followed by Autologous    on  Microbiome Structure and Metabolic Potential.</a></h1><p>Strategies to prevent multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections are scarce, but autologous    (autoFMT) may limit gastrointestinal MDRO expansion. AutoFMT involves banking one's  during a healthy state for later use in restoring gut  following perturbation. This pilot study evaluated the effect of autoFMT on gastrointestinal microbiome taxonomic composition, resistance gene content, and metabolic capacity after exposure to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Amox-Clav). Ten healthy participants were enrolled. All received  days of Amox-Clav. Half were randomized to autoFMT, derived from stool collected pre-antimicrobial exposure, by enema, and half to saline enema. Participants submitted stool samples pre- and post-Amox-Clav and enema and during a 90-day follow-up period. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed taxonomic composition, resistance gene content, and metabolic capacity. Amox-Clav significantly altered gut taxonomic composition in all participants ( = 10,  < 0.01); however, only three participants exhibited major changes at the phylum level following exposure. In the cohort as a whole, beta-lactamase genes were enriched following Amox-Clav ( < 0.05), and predicted metabolic capacity was significantly altered ( < 0.01). Species composition, metabolic capacity, and beta-lactamase abundance returned to pre-antimicrobial exposure state 7 days after either autoFMT or saline enema ( > 0.05, compared to enrollment). Alterations to microbial metabolic capacity occurred following antimicrobial exposure even in participants without substantial taxonomic disruption, potentially creating open niches for pathogen colonization. Our findings suggest that metabolic potential is an important consideration for complete assessment of antimicrobial impact on the microbiome. AutoFMT was well tolerated and may have contributed to phylogenetic recovery. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier .) The spread of multidrug resistance among pathogenic organisms threatens the efficacy of antimicrobial treatment options. The human gut serves as a reservoir for many drug-resistant organisms and their resistance genes, and perturbation of the gut microbiome by antimicrobial exposure can open metabolic niches to resistant pathogens. Once established in the gut, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria can persist even after antimicrobial exposure ceases. Strategies to prevent multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections are scarce, but autologous    (autoFMT) may limit gastrointestinal MDRO expansion. AutoFMT involves banking one's  during a healthy state for later use in restoring gut  following perturbation. This pilot study evaluated the effect of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Amox-Clav) exposure and autoFMT on gastrointestinal microbiome taxonomic composition, resistance gene content, and metabolic capacity. Importantly, we found that metabolic capacity was perturbed even in cases where gross phylogeny remained unchanged and that autoFMT was safe and well tolerated.Copyright © 2018 Bulow et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404941>Human Bacterial Repertoire of the Urinary Tract: a Potential Paradigm Shift.</a></h1><p>The aim of this article is to review the human repertoire of bacteria in urine already described by culture and metagenomic techniques and published in the literature. Our study led us to compare this repertoire with other available human repertoires. We followed automatic and manual bibliographical methods and found 562 bacterial species reported in the literature as part of the human urinary . Of the 562 species, 322 were described only by culture, 101 by both culture and metagenomics, and 139 only by metagenomics. A total of 352 species (62.6%) have been associated with at least one case report of human infection, of which 225 (40.0%) have been described as causative agents of urinary tract infection. The urinary tract bacterial repertoire contains 21.4% of the known prokaryotic diversity associated with human beings (464 species in common), and it shares 23.6% species with the human gut  (350 species in common, 62.3% of the urine species). The urinary repertoire shares a significant difference in aerointolerant species compared with those of the gut  (100/562 [17.8%] and 505/1,484 [34.0%], respectively;  < 0.001; odds ratio [OR] = 9.0 [7.0 to 11.4]). Studies using high-throughput sequencing show a higher proportion of aerointolerant bacteria in urine (74/240 [30.8%]) than studies using culture techniques (40/423 [9.%]). Most pathogenic bacteria are part of the commensal human urinary tract bacteria, and their pathogenicity may occur following any imbalance of this .

This study sought to investigate whether  of   from drug-free patients with schizophrenia into specific pathogen-free mice could cause schizophrenia-like behavioral abnormalities. The results revealed that  of   from schizophrenic patients into antibiotic-treated mice caused behavioral abnormalities such as psychomotor hyperactivity, impaired learning and memory in the recipient animals. These mice also showed elevation of the kynurenine-kynurenic acid pathway of tryptophan degradation in both periphery and brain, as well as increased basal extracellular dopamine in prefrontal cortex and -hydroxytryptamine in hippocampus, compared with their counterparts receiving  from healthy controls. Furthermore, colonic luminal filtrates from the mice transplanted with patients'   increased both kynurenic acid synthesis and kynurenine aminotransferase II activity in cultured hepatocytes and forebrain cortical slices. Sixty species of donor-derived bacteria showed significant difference between the mice colonized with the patients' and the controls'  , highlighting 78 differentially enriched functional modules including tryptophan biosynthesis function. In conclusion, our study suggests that the abnormalities in the composition of gut  contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia partially through the manipulation of tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972640>Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of    in Active Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h1><p>The therapeutic role of    in ulcerative colitis varies across different reports. This study aims to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of a strategy called step-up    for ulcerative colitis.Two clinical trials (, ) for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo score range 6-12) were performed from November 2012 to July 2017. Both studies were pooled for analysis on the safety and efficacy of    in patients with ulcerative colitis over a 1-year follow-up. The step-up    strategy included step 1: single   ; step 2: two or more   transplantations; and step 3:   transplantations followed by immunosuppressants. Long-term clinical efficacy and adverse events were assessed, and multiple factors related to    were evaluated.Of 134 eligible patients in this real-word study, 81.3% (109/134) were included for analysis. The follow-up ranged from 1 to  years.   -related adverse events were observed in 17.4% (43/247) of    procedures including one serious adverse event (myasthenia gravis) and 56 non-serious adverse events. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that both the method of preparation of  from stool using the automatic system and the delivery method of colonic transendoscopic enteral tubing were associated with a lower rate of   -related adverse events (p = 0.023, p = 0.017, respectively).

In a randomized controlled trial of FMT in patients with active UC, we aimed to identify bacterial taxonomic and functional factors associated with response to therapy.We performed a double-blind trial of 81 patients with active UC randomly assigned to groups that received an initial colonoscopic infusion and then intensive multidonor FMT or placebo enemas,  d/wk for 8 weeks. Patients in the FMT group received blended homogenized stool from 3-7 unrelated donors. Patients in the placebo group were eligible to receive open-label FMT after the double-blind study period. We collected 314  samples from the patients at screening, every 4 weeks during treatment, and 8 weeks after the blinded or open-label FMT therapy. We also collected 160 large-bowel biopsy samples from the patients at study entry, at completion of 8 weeks of blinded therapy, and at the end of open-label FMT, if applicable. We analyzed 105  samples from the 14 individual donors (n = 55), who in turn contributed to 21 multidonor batches (n = 50). Bacteria in colonic and  samples were analyzed by both 16S ribosomal RNA gene and transcript amplicon sequencing; 285  samples were analyzed by shotgun metagenomics, and 60  samples were analyzed for metabolome features.FMT increased microbial diversity and altered composition, based on analyses of colon and  samples collected before vs after FMT. Diversity was greater in  and colon samples collected before and after FMT treatment from patients who achieved remission compared with patients who did not. Patients in remission after FMT had enrichment of Eubacterium hallii and Roseburia inulivorans compared with patients who did not achieve remission after FMT and had increased levels of short-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and secondary bile acids. Patients who did not achieve remission had enrichment of Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Sutterella wadsworthensis, and Escherichia species and increased levels of heme and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Bacteroides in donor stool were associated with remission in patients receiving FMT, and Streptococcus species in donor stool was associated with no response to FMT.In an analysis of  and colonic mucosa samples from patients receiving FMT for active UC and stool samples from donors, we associated specific bacteria and metabolic pathways with induction of remission.

In our present study, we determined whether an alteration in GM is a decisive factor in anxiety-like and depression-like behavior and its impact on brain neurochemistry. An antibiotic cocktail was used to deplete the GM of mice before they were colonized, via    (FMT), by the GM of control mice or mice that had been exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS donors). The CUMS-donor group of mice and the mice that were colonized by their  (the CUMS-recipient group) both showed higher levels of anxiety- and depression-like behavior compared to the controls. The GM community of the CUMS-donor and CUMS-recipient was distinctively different from the controls, with the CUMS group characterized by a lower relative abundance of  and a higher relative abundance of . Interestingly, FMT affected both behavior and neuroinflammation. Mice given the CUMS  had significant elevations of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the hippocampus, which were accompanied by upregulated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in the hippocampus. These results suggest that GM modulates pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus through dysfunctional -gut-brain axis, exacerbating anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes. Key Points Chronic unpredictable mild stress increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior in mice. Mice colonized with gut  (GM) from stressed mice showed similar behaviors. The GM composition of the donor and recipient mice was also comparable. Their relative pattern of two bacteria has been tied to neuroinflammatory activity. The results suggest a link between GM, brain function, and anxiety and depression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30118620>Assessment of urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate as a marker for gut  diversity and abundance of Clostridiales.</a></h1><p>After allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell  (allo-HCT), urinary levels of 3-indoxyl sulfate (3-IS) correlate with the relative abundance of bacteria from the class Clostridia (RAC), and antibiotic treatment is considered the major determinant of this outcome. A high RAC has been associated with favorable outcome after allo-HCT and protection from Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We assessed correlations between alpha diversity, RAC and urinary 3-IS levels in a non-allo-HCT clinical cohort of antibiotic treated patients to further explore 3-IS as a biomarker of reduced diversity and predisposition to CDI. and urinary specimens were analyzed from 40 non-allo-HCT hospitalized patients before and 9 ± 2 days after initiation of intravenous antibiotic treatment.   were analyzed by 16s RNA sequencing and urinary 3-IS was analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the predictive value of 3-IS.At a RAC cutoff of <30%, the binary logarithm of 3-IS (medium 3-IS: ≤2.; high 3-IS: >2.) was predictive with an accuracy of 82% (negative predictive value: 87%, positive predictive value 67%). Accuracy was improved by combing antibiotic history with 3-IS levels (accuracy 89%, npv 88%, ppv 92%).In conjunction with patient antibiotic history, 3-IS is a candidate marker to predict RAC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29358877>Relationship between intestinal  and ulcerative colitis: Mechanisms and clinical application of probiotics and   .</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease that mainly affects the colon and rectum. It is believed that genetic factors, host immune system disorders, intestinal  dysbiosis, and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of UC. However, studies on the role of intestinal  in the pathogenesis of UC have been inconclusive. Studies have shown that probiotics improve intestinal mucosa barrier function and immune system function and promote secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, thereby inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the intestine.    (FMT) can reduce bowel permeability and thus the severity of disease by increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, which help maintain the integrity of the epithelial barrier. FMT can also restore immune dysbiosis by inhibiting Th1 differentiation, activity of T cells, leukocyte adhesion, and production of inflammatory factors. Probiotics and FMT are being increasingly used to treat UC, but their use is controversial because of uncertain efficacy.

Optimal management of these patients decreases the risk of relapse and proximal disease extension, and may prevent disease progression, complications, and need for immunosuppressive therapy. With several medications (eg, sulfasalazine, diazo-bonded -aminosalicylates [ASA], mesalamines, and corticosteroids, including budesonide) and complex dosing formulations, regimens, and routes, to treat a disease with variable anatomic extent, there is considerable practice variability in the management of patients with mild-moderate UC. Hence, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized clinical guidelines on this topic. To inform clinical guidelines, this technical review was developed in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework for interventional studies. Focused questions included the following: (1) comparative effectiveness and tolerability of different oral -ASA therapies (sulfalsalazine vs diazo-bonded -ASAs vs mesalamine; low- (<2 g) vs standard (2-3 g/d) vs high-dose (>3 g/d) mesalamine); (2) comparison of different dosing regimens (once-daily vs multiple times per day dosing) and routes (oral vs rectal vs both oral and rectal); (3) role of oral budesonide in patients mild-moderate UC; (4) comparative effectiveness and tolerability of rectal -ASA and corticosteroid formulations in patients with distal colitis; and () role of alternative therapies like probiotics, curcumin, and    in the management of mild-moderate UC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

In order to provide this service at Stony Brook University Hospital, we initiated an open-label prospective study of single colonoscopic FMT among patients with ≥ 2 recurrences of CDI, with the intention of monitoring microbial composition in the recipient before and after FMT, as compared with their respective donor. We also initiated a concurrent open label prospective trial of single colonoscopic FMT of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) not responsive to therapy, after obtaining an IND permit (IND 15642). To characterize how FMT alters the   in patients with recurrent Clostridia difficile infections (CDI) and/or UC, we report the results of a pilot microbiome analysis of 11 recipients with a history of 2 or more recurrences of C. difficile infections without inflammatory bowel disease (CDI-only), 3 UC recipients with recurrent C. difficile infections (CDI + UC), and  UC recipients without a history of C. difficile infections (UC-only).V3V4 Illumina 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was performed on the pre-FMT, 1-week post-FMT, and 3-months post-FMT recipient  samples along with those collected from the healthy donors. Fitted linear mixed models were used to examine the effects of Group (CDI-only, CDI + UC, UC-only), timing of FMT (Donor, pre-FMT, 1-week post-FMT, 3-months post-FMT) and first order Group*FMT interactions on the diversity and composition of  . Pairwise comparisons were then carried out on the recipient vs. donor and between the pre-FMT, 1-week post-FMT, and 3-months post-FMT recipient samples within each group.Significant effects of FMT on overall  composition (e.g., beta diversity) were observed for the CDI-only and CDI + UC groups. Marked decreases in the relative abundances of the strictly anaerobic Bacteroidetes phylum, and two Firmicutes sub-phyla associated with butyrate production (Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae) were observed between the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipient groups. There were corresponding increases in the microaerophilic Proteobacteria phylum and the Firmicutes/Bacilli group in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipient groups. At a more granular level, significant effects of FMT were observed for 81 genus-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in at least one of the three recipient groups (p<0.00016 with Bonferroni correction). Pairwise comparisons of the estimated pre-FMT recipient/donor relative abundance ratios identified 6 Gammaproteobacteria OTUs, including the Escherichia-Shigella genus, and 2 Fusobacteria OTUs with significantly increased relative abundance in the pre-FMT samples of all three recipient groups (FDR < 0.05), however the magnitude of the fold change was much larger in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipients than in the UC-only recipients. Depletion of butyrate producing OTUs, such as Faecalibacterium, in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipients, were restored after FMT.The results from this pilot study suggest that the microbial imbalances in the CDI + UC recipients more closely resemble those of the CDI-only recipients than the UC-only recipients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28789710>Transplanted human   enhanced Guillain Barré syndrome autoantibody responses after Campylobacter jejuni infection in C57BL/6 mice.</a></h1><p>Campylobacter jejuni is the leading antecedent infection to the autoimmune neuropathy Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which is accompanied by an autoimmune anti-ganglioside antibody attack on peripheral nerves. Previously, we showed that contrasting immune responses mediate C. jejuni induced colitis and autoimmunity in interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient mice, dependent upon the infecting strain.

We compared these responses in C57BL/6 mice with either (1) stable human gut  ()  or (2) conventional mouse  ().Inoculating germ-free C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice with a mixed human  slurry provided a murine model that stably passed its  over >20 generations. Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) facilities, while extra precautions of having caretakers wear sterile garb along with limited access ensured that no mouse pathogens were acquired.  conferred many changes upon the WT model in contrast to previous results, which showed only colonization with no disease after C. jejuni challenge.

The primary outcome was the rate of worsening in IBD activity.Twenty-nine studies with 514 FMT-treated IBD patients were included. Range of follow up was 4 weeks to 3 y. The pooled rate of IBD worsening was 14.9% (95% CI 10-21%). Heterogeneity was detected: I2 D 52.1%, Cochran Q test D 58.1, p D 0.01. A priori subgroup analyses were performed. Although not significant, the pooled rate of worsening in IBD activity following FMT for CDI (22.7% (95% CI: 13-36%)) was higher compared with FMT for IBD (11.1% (95% CI 7-17%)). Rates of worsening in IBD after lower GI FMT delivery revealed a higher rate of worsening in IBD activity (16.% (95% CI: 11-24%)) compared with upper GI delivery (.6% (95% CI: 2-16%)). Rates of worsening in high quality studies and randomized controls trials (RCTS) suggested a marginal risk of worsening in IBD activity (4.6%, (95% CI: 1.8-11%). Rates of IBD worsening are overall marginal across high quality RCTS. It is unknown if the FMT itself led to the worsening of IBD in this small fraction or if this represents alternative etiologies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30852592>Microbial Engraftment and Efficacy of    for Clostridium Difficile in Patients With and Without Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Recurrent and severe Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) are treated with    (FMT). Uncertainty exists regarding FMT effectiveness for CDI with underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and regarding its effects on disease activity and effectiveness in transferring the donor  to patients with and without IBD.Subjects with and without IBD who underwent FMT for recurrent or severe CDI between 2013 and 2016 at The Mount Sinai Hospital were followed for up to 6 months. The primary outcome was CDI recurrence 6 months after FMT. Secondary outcomes were (1) CDI recurrence 2 months after FMT; (2) frequency of IBD flare after FMT; (3)  engraftment after FMT; (and 4) predictors of CDI recurrence.One hundred thirty-four patients, 46 with IBD, were treated with FMT. Follow-up was available in 83 and 118 patients at 6 and 2 months, respectively. There was no difference in recurrence in patients with and without IBD at 6 months (38.7% vs 36.%; P > 0.99) and 2 months (22.% vs 17.9%; P = 0.63). Proton pump inhibitor use, severe CDI, and comorbid conditions were predictors of recurrence. Pre-FMT  was not predictive of CDI recurrence. Subjects with active disease requiring medication escalation had reduced engraftment, with no difference in engraftment based on CDI recurrence or IBD endoscopic severity at FMT.Inflammatory bowel disease did not affect CDI recurrence rates 6 months after FMT. Pre-FMT  was not predictive of recurrence, and microbial engraftment was impacted in those requiring IBD treatment escalation, though not by CDI recurrence or IBD disease severity.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Some intestinal bacteria have been reported to potentiate intestinal carcinogenesis by producing genotoxins, altering the immune response and intestinal microenvironment, and activating oncogenic signaling pathways. We investigated whether stool from patients with CRC could directly induce colorectal carcinogenesis in mice.We obtained stored stool samples from participants in a metagenome study performed in Hong Kong. Conventional (male C57BL/6) mice were given azoxymethane to induce colon neoplasia after receiving a course of antibiotics in drinking water. Mice were gavaged twice weekly with stool from  patients with CRC or  healthy individuals (controls) for  weeks. Germ-free C57BL/6 mice were gavaged once with stool from  patients with CRC or  controls. We collected intestinal tissues from mice and performed histology, immunohistochemistry, expression microarray, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and flow cytometry analyses. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing analysis of  from mice.Significantly higher proportions of conventional mice fed with stool from individuals with CRC than control stool developed high-grade dysplasia (P < .05) and macroscopic polyps (P < .01). We observed a higher proportion of proliferating (Ki-67-positive) cells in colons of germ-free mice fed with stool from patients with CRC vs those fed with stool from controls (P < .05).  from germ-free and conventional mice fed with stool from patients with CRC vs controls contained different microbial compositions, with lower richness in mice fed with stool from patients with CRC. Intestines collected from conventional and germ-free mice fed with stool from patients with CRC had increased expression of cytokines that modulate inflammation, including C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2, interleukin 17A (IL17A), IL22, and IL23A. Intestines from conventional and germ-free mice fed with stool from patients with CRC contained higher proportions of T-helper 1 (Th1) cells (2.25% vs 0.44%) and Th17 cells (2.08% vs 0.31%) (P < .05 for each) than mice fed with stool from controls. Real-time polymerase chain reaction arrays revealed up-regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, stemness, apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastasis in mice fed with stool from patients with CRC.We fed stool samples from patients with CRC and heathy individuals to germ-free mice and conventional mice with azoxymethane. We found stool from patients with CRC to increase the numbers of polyps, levels of intestinal dysplasia and proliferation, markers of inflammation, and proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells in colon, compared with stool from individuals without CRC. This study provides evidence that the   from patients with CRC can promote tumorigenesis in germ-free mice and mice given a carcinogen.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to compare the gut microbiome found in cirrhotic patients with or without HCC.From 407 patients with Child Pugh A/B cirrhosis prospectively followed, 25 with HCC (cases) were matched with 25 without HCC (wo-HCC) in a 1:1 ratio according to age, gender, etiology, Child Pugh and severity of portal hypertension. In addition, results were also compared with 25 healthy subjects.  stool samples were sequenced for the V3-V4 region of the microbial 16S rRNA (Illumina MiSeq Platform). Plasma cytokines were quantified including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α).We found a differential abundance in family members of Firmicutes with a 3-fold increase of Erysipelotrichaceae and a -fold decrease in family Leuconostocaceae in HCC when compared to wo-HCC controls. Genus Fusobacterium was found to be -fold decreased in HCC vs wo-HCC. The ratio bacteriodes/prevotella was increased in HCC. Three operational taxonomic units (OTUs), genus Odoribacter and Butyricimonas were more abundant in HCC, whereas a decreased abundance in Lachnospiraceae family genus Dorea was observed in HCC patients. A Random Forest model trained with differential abundant taxa correctly classified HCC individuals. This pattern was associated with an inflammatory milieu with a putative increased activation of NOD-like receptor pathways.We found a pattern of microbiome linked to inflammation that could be potentially useful as HCC biomarker after follow-up validation studies.Copyright © 2019 Fundación Clínica Médica Sur, A.C.

The gut  has been touted as an important mediator of liver disease development; however, the precise roles of gut  in regulating sepsis-induced liver injury are unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of the gut  in sepsis-induced liver injury and the underlying mechanism. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to induce polymicrobial sepsis and related liver injury.    (FMT) was used to validate the roles of gut  in these pathologies. Metabolomics analysis was performed to characterize the metabolic profile differences between sepsis-resistant (Res; survived to 7 days after CLP) and sepsis-sensitive (Sen; moribund before or approximately 24 hours after CLP) mice. Mice gavaged with  from Sen mice displayed more-severe liver damage than did mice gavaged with  from Res mice. The gut microbial metabolic profile between Sen and Res mice was different. In particular, the  from Res mice generated more granisetron, a -hydroxytryptamine 3 (-HT ) receptor antagonist, than the  from Sen mice. Granisetron protected mice against CLP-induced death and liver injury. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokine expression by macrophages after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge was markedly reduced in the presence of granisetron. Both treatment with granisetron and genetic knockdown of the -HT receptor in cells suppressed nuclear factor kappa B (NF-кB) transactivation and phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) accumulation in macrophages. Gut microbial granisetron levels showed a significantly negative correlation with plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in septic patients. Conclusion: Our study indicated that gut  plays a key role in the sensitization of sepsis-induced liver injury and associates granisetron as a hepatoprotective compound during sepsis development.© 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28852524>   for  infection in patients with ileal pouches.</a></h1><p> infection (CDI) in patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has been increasingly recognized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of    (FMT) in patients with pouch and CDI.  All consecutive patients that underwent FMT for CDI from 2012 to 2016 were extracted from our IRB-approved, prospectively maintained Registry of Pouch Disorders. The primary outcome was negative stool tests for  after FMT and the secondary outcomes were symptomatic and endoscopic responses.  A total of 13 patients were included in this study, with 10 being Caucasian males (76.9%). All patients had underlying ulcerative colitis for J pouch surgery. After a mean of 2.8±0.8 courses of antibiotic treatments was given and failed, 22 sessions of FMT were administered with an average of 1.7±1.1 sessions each. Within the 22 sessions, 16 were given via pouchoscopy, 4 via esophagogastroduodenoscopy and 2 via enemas. All patients tested negative on  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after the initial FMT with a total of 7/12 (58.3%) documented patients showed symptomatic improvements and 3/11 (27.3%) patients showed endoscopic improvement according to the modified Pouchitis Disease Activity Index. During the follow-up of 1.2±1.1 years, there were a total of five patients (38.%) that had recurrence after the successful initial treatment and four of them were successfully treated again with FMT.  FMT appeared to be effective in eradication of CDI in patients with ileal pouches.

An altered gut microbiome has been identified in some IBS patients, and    (FMT) has been suggested to treat IBS. We performed meta-analyses and systematic review of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of FMT in IBS.We performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science. Selection criteria included RCTs of FMT vs placebo using FMT excipients or autologous FMT in IBS. Meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the summary relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of combined studies for primary outcome of improvement in global IBS symptoms as measured by accepted integrative symptom questionnaires or dichotomous responses to questions of overall symptom improvement.Among 742 citations identified, 7 were deemed to be potentially relevant, of which 4 studies involving 254 participants met eligibility. No significant difference in global improvement of IBS symptoms was observed at 12 weeks in FMT vs placebo (RR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.48-1.79). Heterogeneity among studies was significant (I = 79%). Subgroup analyses revealed benefits of single-dose FMT using colonoscopy and nasojejunal tubes in comparison with autologous FMT for placebo treatment (number needed to treat = , RR = 1.59; 95% CI 1.06-2.39; I = 0%) and a reduction in likelihood of improvement of multiple-dose capsule FMT RCTs (number needed to harm = 3, RR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.34-0.85; I = 13%). Placebo response was 33.7% in nonoral FMT RCTs and 67.8% in capsule FMT RCTs. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation quality of the body of evidence was very low.Current evidence from RCTs does not suggest a benefit of FMT for global IBS symptoms. There remain questions regarding the efficacy of FMT in IBS as well as the lack of a clean explanation on the discrepant results among RCTs in subgroup analyses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29780597>Outcomes and prognostic factors of    in patients with slow transit constipation: results from a prospective study with long-term follow-up.</a></h1><p>Gut  may contribute to regulate colonic motility, which is involved in the etiology of constipation.    (FMT) has been demonstrated to restore intestinal homeostasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes and prognostic factors of FMT for the treatment of slow transit constipation (STC).Fifty-two patients with STC received standardized FMT and were followed up for 6 months. Bowel habit, colonic transit time, constipation-related symptoms (PAC-SYM score), quality of life (PAC-QOL score), treatment satisfaction scores and adverse events were monitored. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients having on average three or more complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week.The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in 50.0%, 38.% and 32.7% of patients over week intervals 3-4, 9-12 and 21-24, respectively ( < 0.01 for all comparisons). Significant improvements were also observed in other bowel movement assessments, colonic transit time, constipation-related symptoms and quality of life; but all improvements diminished at weeks 12 and 24. Incompleteness of evacuation served as the only factor associated with efficacy. No serious treatment-related adverse events were observed.This study suggested FMT was effective and safe for STC, while a late loss of efficacy was also observed. A lower degree of sensation of incompleteness predicted a better outcome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30025704>Inhibiting Growth of Clostridioides difficile by Restoring Valerate, Produced by the Intestinal .</a></h1><p>   (FMT) is effective for treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but there are concerns about its long-term safety. Understanding the mechanisms of the effects of FMT could help us design safer, targeted therapies. We aimed to identify microbial metabolites that are important for C difficile growth.We used a CDI chemostat model as a tool to study the effects of FMT in vitro. The following analyses were performed: C difficile plate counts, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry bile acid profiling. FMT mixtures were prepared using fresh  samples provided by donors enrolled in an FMT program in the United Kingdom. Results from chemostat experiments were validated using human stool samples, C difficile batch cultures, and C57BL/6 mice with CDI. Human stool samples were collected from 16 patients with recurrent CDI and healthy donors (n = ) participating in an FMT trial in Canada.In the CDI chemostat model, clindamycin decreased valerate and deoxycholic acid concentrations and increased C difficile total viable counts and valerate precursors, taurocholic acid, and succinate concentrations. After we stopped adding clindamycin, levels of bile acids and succinate recovered, whereas levels of valerate and valerate precursors did not. In the CDI chemostat model, FMT increased valerate concentrations and decreased C difficile total viable counts (94% decrease), spore counts (86% decrease), and valerate precursor concentrations; concentrations of bile acids were unchanged. In stool samples from patients with CDI, valerate was depleted before FMT but restored after FMT. Clostridioides difficile batch cultures confirmed that valerate decreased vegetative growth, and that taurocholic acid was required for germination but had no effect on vegetative growth. Clostridioides difficile total viable counts were decreased by 95% in mice with CDI given glycerol trivalerate compared with phosphate buffered saline.We identified valerate as a metabolite that is depleted with clindamycin and only recovered with FMT. Valerate is a target for a rationally designed recurrent CDI therapy.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

To develop novel treatments, preclinical models may provide novel mechanistic insights.We characterized the gut  of male adult Flinders sensitive line (FSL) rats, an animal model of depression, and their controls, Flinders resistant line (FRL) rats using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Moreover, we performed    (using saline or pooled FRL/FSL ) to study if the potential strain-specific differences could be transferred from one strain to the other, and if these differences were reflected in their depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test.FSL rats tended to have lower bacterial richness and altered relative abundances of several bacterial phyla, families, and species, including higher Proteobacteria and lower Elusimicrobia and Saccharibacteria. There was a clear separation between FRL and FSL rat strains, but no effect of treatment, i.e., the bacterial composition of FSL rats receiving FRL  was still more similar to FSL and not FRL rats. Similarly, the  did not reverse behavioral differences in the forced swim test, although FSL  significantly increased immobility compared with saline.Our study showed that the gut  composition of the depressive-like rats markedly differed from their controls, which may be of value for future -targeted work in this and similar animal models.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169545>   in children: current concepts.</a></h1><p>Administration of  material into the gastrointestinal tract, termed    (FMT), is increasingly recognized as an effective treatment option for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (RCDI). The impact of FMT on host microbial communities and subsequent disease states has also been explored in recent years for conditions as varied as inflammatory bowel disease especially ulcerative colitis, metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, graft-versus-host disease in hematopoietic stem cell  recipients, and autism and autism spectrum disorders. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence for FMT as a treatment option in various pediatric illnesses.The rate of C. difficile infection is rising among children, and is associated with significant morbidity and disease, with recurrence in up to 20% of pediatric patients. Several randomized controlled trials evaluating the utility of FMT in RCDI in comparison to vancomycin have been published and demonstrate high rates of efficacy between 70 and 100%. In addition, the safety of FMT in the treatment of RCDI has been well described in the adult population, with several pediatric case series demonstrating similar rates of tolerability and adverse events. FMT in ulcerative colitis appears promising, especially with multiple infusions administered via the lower gastrointestinal tract. However, there are several limitations, including the lack of uniformity of protocols used, source of FMT, route of administration and the lack of standardization of concomitant therapies. The data on usage of FMT for other indications are preliminary and limited.FMT is recognized as an effective treatment option for RCDI and is increasing sought by parents. Although limited, pediatric studies to date on the use of FMT for RCDI demonstrate similar efficacy rates as in the adult population. FMT has been proposed as a treatment option for an increasing number of pediatric conditions, and additional studies are needed to delineate the efficacy of FMT outside of RCDI, as well as its short and long-term impacts on human health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30610862>   Is Superior to Fidaxomicin for Treatment of Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection.</a></h1><p>   (FMT) is recommended for treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI). We performed a single-center randomized trial to compare the effects of FMT with those of fidaxomicin and vancomycin.We studied consecutive adults with rCDI seen at a gastroenterology clinic in Denmark from April , 2016 through June 10, 2018. Patients were randomly assigned to a group that received FMT, applied by colonoscopy or nasojejunal tube, after 4-10 days of vancomycin (125 mg 4 times daily; FMTv; n = 24), 10 days of fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily; n = 24), or 10 days of vancomycin (125 mg 4 times daily; n = 16). Patients who had rCDI after this course of treatment and patients who could not be randomly assigned to groups were offered rescue FMTv. The primary outcome was combined clinical resolution and a negative result from a polymerase chain reaction test for Clostridium difficile (CD) toxin 8 weeks after the allocated treatment. Secondary end points included clinical resolution at week 8.All 64 patients received their assigned treatment. The combination of clinical resolution and negative results from the test for CD were observed in 17 patients given FMTv (71%), 8 patients given fidaxomicin (33%), and 3 patients given vancomycin (19%; P = .009 for FMTv vs fidaxomicin; P = .001 for FMTv vs vancomycin; P = .31 for fidaxomicin vs vancomycin). Clinical resolution was observed in 22 patients given FMTv (92%), 10 patients given fidaxomicin (42%), and 3 patients given vancomycin (19%; P = .0002; P < .0001; P = .13). Results did not differ significantly between patients who received FMTv as their initial therapy and patients who received rescue FMTv. There was 1 serious adverse event that might have been related to FMTv.In a randomized trial of patients with rCDI, we found the FMTv combination superior to fidaxomicin or vancomycin based on end points of clinical and microbiological resolution or clinical resolution alone.

There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis.    (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and non-alcohol fatty liver disease.An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1. cm × 2.0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, he reported new hair growth on the affected region of his scalp, with some of his white hair gradually turning to black, without taking any other therapies for alopecia areata before and after FMT.FMT might act as a potential therapy for patients who suffer from alopecia areata.

However, there are a paucity of data on long-term durability and safety of FMT. The aim of this study is to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of FMT for RCDI. Ninety-four patients underwent FMT via retention enema for RCDI between 2008 and 2012 and completed a follow-up questionnaire 4 to 8 years following the last FMT. Of these, 32 were unreachable and 37 were deceased; 23 of the remaining 25 participants completed the survey. No CDI recurrences were reported in patients treated with FMT; 12 of the 23 participants (52.2%) received at least one course of non-CDI antibiotic(s). Nine participants (40.9%) received probiotics and 4 (17.4%) received both non-CDI antibiotics and probiotics. All 23 participants rated their overall health compared with pre-FMT. Current health was considered "much better" in 17 patients (73.9%); "somewhat better" in 3 patients (13.0%); and "about the same" in 3 patients (13.0%).

In recent years, the efficacy and economic benefits of FMT in the treatment of IBS have received increasing attention from researchers.A search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on treating IBS with FMT will be performed using 9 databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, ClinicalTrails, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Sino Med, ScienceDirect, VIP, and Wanfang Data. Two reviewers will independently screen data extraction studies and assess study quality and risk of bias. The risk of bias for each RCT will be assessed against the Cochrane Handbook standards to assess methodological quality.

Secondary outcomes included (1) serious and minor adverse events, (2) changes in quality of life by the 36-Item Short Form Survey on a scale of 0 (worst possible quality of life) to 100 (best quality of life), and (3) patient perception on a scale of 1 (not at all unpleasant) to 10 (extremely unpleasant) and satisfaction on a scale of 1 (best) to 10 (worst).Among 116 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 58 [19] years; 79 women [68%]), 105 (91%) completed the trial, with 57 patients randomized to the capsule group and 59 to the colonoscopy group. In per-protocol analysis, prevention of RCDI after a single treatment was achieved in 96.2% in both the capsule group (51/53) and the colonoscopy group (50/52) (difference, 0%; 1-sided 95% CI, -6.1% to infinity; P < .001), meeting the criterion for noninferiority. One patient in each group died of underlying cardiopulmonary illness unrelated to FMT. Rates of minor adverse events were .4% for the capsule group vs 12.% for the colonoscopy group. There was no significant between-group difference in improvement in quality of life. A significantly greater proportion of participants receiving capsules rated their experience as "not at all unpleasant" (66% vs 44%; difference, 22% [95% CI, 3%-40%]; P = .01).Among adults with RCDI, FMT via oral capsules was not inferior to delivery by colonoscopy for preventing recurrent infection over 12 weeks. Treatment with oral capsules may be an effective approach to treating RCDI.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782287>Ameliorative effect of probiotics (Lactobacillus paracaseii and Protexin®) and prebiotics (propolis and bee pollen) on clindamycin and propionic acid-induced oxidative stress and altered gut  in a rodent model of autism.</a></h1><p>Colonization by toxin-producing bacteria in the gut plays a major role in bowel problems in autistic patients. Prebiotics can inhibit the growth of these pathogenic microbes by nourishing beneficial bacteria, while probiotics--live microorganisms--can balance the gut bacteria; thus, both together can maintain healthy bacteria in the gut. The present study was conducted to find the effect of probiotics and prebiotics in balancing the gut flora in a rodent model of autism linked with a clindamycin-induced altered gut. The effects of probiotics and prebiotics on oxidative stress markers in the brain were also evaluated. Eight groups of hamsters were assigned, with Group I serving as the control; Group II, as the autistic model, was treated with 250 mg propionic acid/kg BW/day for 3 days; Group III was treated with clindamycin 30 mg/kg BW for 3 days; Groups IV and V were treated with bee pollen and propolis (supposed prebiotics) at a dose of 250 mg/kg BW/day for 28 days; Group VI and Group VII were treated with Lactobacillus paracaseii and Protexin® (supposed probiotics) for 28 days; and finally, Group VIII was anorectally transplanted with stool from normal animals for  days. Remarkable changes were measured in oxidative stress markers, primarily glutathione and vitamin C, in the brains of hamsters in the propionic acid- and clindamycin-treated group. All probiotic/prebiotic treatments showed ameliorative effects; however, lactobacillus had the strongest effect. We conclude that pro-and prebiotic supplements may be effective to revive healthy digestive system function in autistic patients.

Of 49 patients, 25 received single FMT for only 6 days (single group), and 24 received periodic FMT with another 6 days FMT 1 month after the first 6 days FMT (periodic group). The follow up was at 12 weeks after treatment. Autonomous defecation frequency, Wexner constipation score, gastrointestinal quality of life index and related adverse reaction were evaluated and compared at 4-, 8- and 12-week after treatment. Statistical analysis was performed on the difference after treatment at each time point, and the greater difference indicated the better improvement.There were no statistically significant differences in general characteristics between the two groups (all P<0.05).

Mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) are found in liver, blood and intestinal mucosa and are a key component of antibacterial host defences. Their role in ALD is unknown.We analysed frequency, phenotype, transcriptional regulation and function of blood MAIT cells in severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH), alcohol-related cirrhosis (ARC) and healthy controls (HC). We also examined direct impact of ethanol, bacterial products from faecal extracts and antigenic hyperstimulation on MAIT cell functionality. Presence of MAIT cells in colon and liver was assessed by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry/gene expression respectively.In ARC and SAH, blood MAIT cells were dramatically depleted, hyperactivated and displayed defective antibacterial cytokine/cytotoxic responses. These correlated with suppression of lineage-specific transcription factors and hyperexpression of homing receptors in the liver with intrahepatic preservation of MAIT cells in ALD. These alterations were stronger in SAH, where surrogate markers of bacterial infection and microbial translocation were higher than ARC. Ethanol exposure in vitro, in vivo alcohol withdrawal and treatment with  had no effect on MAIT cell frequencies, whereas exposure to faecal bacteria/antigens induced functional impairments comparable with blood MAIT cells from ALD and significant MAIT cell depletion, which was not observed in other T cell compartments.In ALD, the antibacterial potency of MAIT cells is compromised as a consequence of contact with microbial products and , suggesting that the 'leaky' gut observed in ALD drives MAIT cell dysfunction and susceptibility to infection in these patients.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

FMT protocols involving anaerobic stool processing methods may enhance microbial viability and allow efficacy with a lower treatment intensity.To assess the efficacy of a short duration of FMT therapy to induce remission in UC using anaerobically prepared stool.A total of 73 adults with mild to moderately active UC were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial in 3 Australian tertiary referral centers between June 2013 and June 2016, with 12-month follow-up until June 2017.Patients were randomized to receive either anaerobically prepared pooled donor FMT (n = 38) or autologous FMT (n = 35) via colonoscopy followed by 2 enemas over 7 days. Open-label therapy was offered to autologous FMT participants at 8 weeks and they were followed up for 12 months.The primary outcome was steroid-free remission of UC, defined as a total Mayo score of ≤2 with an endoscopic Mayo score of 1 or less at week 8. Total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 (0 = no disease and 12 = most severe disease). Steroid-free remission of UC was reassessed at 12 months. Secondary clinical outcomes included adverse events.Among 73 patients who were randomized (mean age, 39 years; women, 33 [45%]), 69 (95%) completed the trial. The primary outcome was achieved in 12 of the 38 participants (32%) receiving pooled donor FMT compared with 3 of the 35 (9%) receiving autologous FMT (difference, 23% [95% CI, 4%-42%]; odds ratio, .0 [95% CI, 1.2-20.1]; P = .03). Five of the 12 participants (42%) who achieved the primary end point at week 8 following donor FMT maintained remission at 12 months. There were 3 serious adverse events in the donor FMT group and 2 in the autologous FMT group.In this preliminary study of adults with mild to moderate UC, 1-week treatment with anaerobically prepared donor FMT compared with autologous FMT resulted in a higher likelihood of remission at 8 weeks.

However, the optimal storage time for the frozen FMT products remains unknown. Using an established murine model of CDI, stability and efficacy of frozen and lyophilized FMT product was studied at time points from 2 months to 15 months. DNA was extracted from  samples from the mice with identification of specific bacterial species by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). FMT product stability and efficacy were measured by occurrence of diarrhea in the challenged mice together with stability of the  composition. The results were analyzed and compared by SAS statistical software. All mice treated with only C. difficile developed diarrhea within 72 h. Mice treated with frozen (n = /group), lyophilized (n = /group) products stored for ≤ 7-month or fresh FMT product (n = 22) were protected from post C. difficile challenge diarrhea. There was no difference between frozen and lyophilized products (n = /group) stored for ≤ 7 months 95% CI 1.00 (0.38-2.64) and 1.00 (0.38-2.64), respectively. Prevention if CDI by frozen and lyophilized product was not different for storage of 9-, 11- and 15-months. qPCR results demonstrated there were no significant quantitative change in Bacteroides and Clostridium species during any of the storage times (P > 0.05).

The intestinal microbiome is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of IBS. The composition of the  microbiome in IBS patients differs from that in healthy individuals, but the exact bacteria species involved in the development of IBS remain to be determined. There is also an imbalance between useful and harmful bacteria (dysbiosis) in the intestinal microbiome in patients with IBS. Consuming prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics has a limited effect on IBS symptoms. In contrast,  microbiome  (FMT) in IBS patients reverses the dysbiosis to normobiosis and reduces the IBS symptoms in about 70% of patients, and is not associated with any serious adverse events. Area covered: The available data on the microbiome and FMT in IBS regarding the efficacy of FMT in managing IBS were found using a PubMed search of these topics. Expert commentary: FMT is a promising tool for managing irritable syndrome. It appears to be effective, easy, and inexpensive procedure.

Microbial dysbiosis is thought to be a major driver of clinical symptoms in ADP. The objective of this proof of concept study was to evaluate safety, efficacy, and donor microbial engraftment of an intensified    (FMT) consisting of a single endoscopic FMT followed by daily oral FMT for 2 weeks in patients with ADP.We performed a prospective placebo-controlled double-blind FMT trial in patents with established ADP and planned to enroll 20 patients in this proof of concept study. In case of non-response, patients were offered an optional open label active FMT treatment. The endpoints were safety, clinical remission without need for antibiotics during 16 weeks of follow-up, quantitative changes of  calprotectin (FCP), and engraftment of donor FMT as determined by metagenomic sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.Due to a lower than expected clinical remission rate and low FMT engraftment, enrollment in the study was stopped prematurely after 6 patients were included. All 6 patients enrolled in the placebo-controlled portion failed to respond and needed antibiotic rescue therapy shortly after FMT. FCP increased in the majority of patients in the setting of relapse after FMT. In the active open label FMT extension study 1 out of  patients achieved antibiotic-free clinical remission. FMT engraftment after active FMT was observed only in this single patient, whereas engraftment of donor FMT occurred in none of the other patients receiving active FMT, paralleling the lack of clinical response.Low donor FMT engraftment resulted in low clinical efficacy of FMT in patients with ADP.

Microbial gut dysbiosis is associated with both AN and SIBO, and therefore gut microbiome changes by serial    (FMT) is a possible therapeutic modality. This study assessed the effects of FMT on gut barrier function,  composition, and the levels of bacterial metabolic products. The patient treatment with FMT led to the improvement of gut barrier function, which was altered prior to FMT. Very low bacterial alpha diversity, a lack of beneficial bacteria, together with a great abundance of fungal species were observed in the patient stool sample before FMT. After FMT, both bacterial species richness and gut microbiome evenness increased in the patient, while the fungal alpha diversity decreased. The total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels (molecules presenting an important source of energy for epithelial gut cells) gradually increased after FMT. Contrarily, one of the most abundant intestinal neurotransmitters, serotonin, tended to decrease throughout the observation period. Overall, gut microbial dysbiosis improvement after FMT was considered. However, there were no signs of patient clinical improvement.

Severe  infection (sCDI) is a serious and rare nosocomial diarrheal complication, especially in MSAP patients.    (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractory and recurrent CDI (rCDI). However, knowledge regarding the initial use of FMT in patients suffering from sCDI is limited.Here, we report an MSAP patient complicated with sCDI who was treated by FMT as a first-line therapy. The patient was a 51-year-old man who suffered from diarrhea in his course of acute pancreatitis. An enzyme immunoassay was performed to detect toxins, and the result was positive for toxin-producing  and toxin B and negative for  ribotype 027. The colonoscopy revealed pseudomembranous colitis. Due to these findings, sCDI was our primary consideration. Because the patient provided informed consent for FMT treatment, we initially treated the patient by FMT rather than metronidazole. Diarrhea resolved within  d after FMT. The patient remained asymptomatic, and the follow-up colonoscopy performed 40 d after discharge showed a complete recovery.

Alterations in , and associated inflammation, can originate from dysfunction in host proteins that manage the , such as the flagellin receptor TLR5. That the complete absence of a  (i.e. germfree conditions) eliminates all evidence of inflammation in TLR5-deficient mice demonstrates that this model of gut inflammation is -dependent. We hypothesize that such  dependency reflects an inability to manage pathobionts, such as Adherent-Invasive E. coli (AIEC). Herein, we examined the extent to which  mismanagement and associated inflammation in TLR5-deficient mice would manifest in a limited and pathobiont-free . For this purpose, WT and TLR5-deficient mice were generated and maintained with the 8-member consortium of bacteria referred to as "Altered Schaedler Flora" (ASF). Such ASF animals were subsequently inoculated with AIEC reference strain LF82.  were assayed for bacterial loads,  lipopolysaccharide and flagellin loads,  inflammatory marker lipocalin-2 and  composition.Relative to similarly maintained WT mice, mice lacking TLR5 (T5KO) did not display low-grade intestinal inflammation nor metabolic syndrome under ASF conditions. Concomitantly, the ASF microbial community was similar between WT and T5KO mice, while inoculation with AIEC strain LF82 resulted in alteration of the ASF community in T5KO mice compared to WT control animals. AIEC LF82 inoculation in ASF T5KO mice resulted in  components having elevated levels of bioactive lipopolysaccharide and flagellin, a modest level of low-grade inflammation and increased adiposity.In a limited-complexity pathobiont-free , loss of the flagellin receptor TLR5 does not impact  composition nor its ability to promote inflammation. Addition of AIEC to this ecosystem perturbs  composition, increases levels of lipopolysaccharide and flagellin, but only modestly promotes gut inflammation and adiposity, suggesting that the phenotypes previously associated with loss of this innate immune receptor require disruption of complex .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586712>Loss of Gut  Alters Immune System Composition and Cripples Postinfarction Cardiac Repair.</a></h1><p>The impact of gut  on the regulation of host physiology has recently garnered considerable attention, particularly in key areas such as the immune system and metabolism.

We observed an association between the gut  depletion and significant reductions in the proportion of myeloid cells and SCFAs, more specifically acetate, butyrate, and propionate. Infiltration of CX3CR1+ monocytes to the peri-infarct zone after MI was also reduced, suggesting impairment of repair after MI. Accordingly, the physiological status and survival of mice were significantly improved after  reconstitution,  of monocytes, or dietary SCFA supplementation. MI was associated with a reorganization of the gut microbial community such as a reduction in Lactobacillus. Supplementing antibiotic-treated mice with a Lactobacillus probiotic before MI restored myeloid cell proportions, yielded cardioprotective effects, and shifted the balance of SCFAs toward propionate.Gut -derived SCFAs play an important role in maintaining host immune composition and repair capacity after MI. This suggests that manipulation of these elements may provide opportunities to modulate pathological outcome after MI and indeed human health and disease as a whole.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556726>New treatment options for inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h1><p>The advent of anti-TNF agents has dramatically changed the treatment algorithms for IBD in the last 15 years, but primarily and more importantly secondary loss of response is often observed. Fortunately , new treatment options have been actively explored and some have already entered our clinical practice. In the class of anti-cytokine agents, the anti-IL12/IL23 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have entered clinical practice with the anti-p40 mAb ustekinumab in Crohn's disease (CD). Also, more selective anti-IL23 agents (anti-p19) have shown efficacy and are being further developed, in contrast to agents inhibiting IL-17 downstream which have failed in clinical trials despite their clear efficacy in psoriasis (Verstockt et al. in Expert Opin Biol Ther 17(1):31-47, 2017; Verstockt et al. in Expert Opin Drug Saf 16(7):809-821, 2017). Following up on the efficacy of the anti-adhesion molecule vedolizumab, etrolizumab (anti-beta-7 integrin) and PF-00547659, an anti-MadCam mAb, are being developed (Lobaton et al. in Aliment Pharmacol Ther 39(6):579-594, 2014). Oral anti-trafficking agents, such as ozanimod, targeting the S1P receptor responsible for the efflux of T-cells from the lymph nodes, have also shown efficacy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Sandborn et al. in N Engl J Med 374(18):1754-1762, 2016). Oral agents inhibiting cell signaling have been explored successfully in IBD. Tofacitinib, a non-selective oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is effective in patients with UC and several other more or less selective Jak1, 2 and 3 inhibitors are being developed for the treatment of CD and UC (Sandborn et al. in N Engl J Med 376(18):1723-1736, 2017; Vermeire et al. in Lancet 389(10066):266-275, 2017; De Vries et al. in J Crohns Colitis 11(7):885-93, 2017). Finally, despite initial disappointing results with systemic administration of mesenchymal stem cells, Alofisel, adipose tissue derived, allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells, locally injected in perianal fistula tracts, induce long-lasting beneficial effects and the drug has been approved in Europe (Panes et al. in Gastroenterology, 2017). In summary, the quest for new treatment options in IBD is very active and justified by the high medical need and unresolved problems patients are facing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301451>Effects of    With Oral Capsules in Obese Patients.</a></h1><p>Studies in mice have shown that the intestinal  can contribute to obesity via the anorexigenic gut hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) and bile acids, which affect lipid metabolism. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, pilot study of the effects of    (FMT) in obese, metabolically uncompromised patients.We performed a double-blind study of 22 obese patients (body mass index [BMI] ≥ kg/m) without a diagnosis of diabetes, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or metabolic syndrome. Participants were assigned randomly (1:1) to groups that received FMT by capsules (induction dose of 30 capsules at week 4 and maintenance dose of 12 capsules at week 8) or placebo capsules. FMT capsules were derived from a single lean donor (BMI, 17. kg/m). Patients were followed up through week 26; the primary outcome was safety. Stool and serum samples were collected from patients at baseline and at weeks 1, 4, 6, 8, and 12 after administration of the first dose of FMT or placebo and analyzed by 16S RNA gene sequencing. Stool and serum samples were analyzed for metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additional outcomes were the change in area under the curve for GLP1 at week 12.We observed no significant differences in adverse events between patients who received FMT vs placebo. There was no increase in the area under the curve of GLP1 in either group. Patients who received FMT had sustained shifts in microbiomes associated with obesity toward those of the donor (P < .001). Patients who received FMT had a sustained decrease in stool levels of taurocholic acid (P < .05) compared with baseline; bile acid profiles began to resemble those of the donor more closely. We did not observe significant changes in mean BMI at week 12 in either group.In a placebo-controlled pilot study, we found that FMT capsules (derived from a lean donor) were safe but did not reduce BMI in obese metabolically uncompromised patients. The FMT capsules were well tolerated and led to sustained changes in the intestinal microbiome and bile acid profiles that were similar to those of the lean donor.

We present the design of randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy and compliance of bowel preparation between mid-gut tubing and oral administering for MRE in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).This is an open-label, multicenter RCT. Ninety-six patients with CD in need of MRE examination and mid-gut tubing (prepared for    and/or enteral nutrition), aged ≥ 14 years, will be included. Patients will be randomized 1:1 into either bowel preparation by oral administering (oral group) or bowel preparation through mid-gut transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET) (tubing group). The primary outcome measures are: (1) degree of discomfort before/during/after bowel preparation for MRE using a visual -grade scale (1 = few,  = very severe); and (2) grade of bowel distention evaluated by a -grade scale (1 = 0-20% segmental distention, 2 = 20-40% distention, 3 = 40-60% distention, 4 = 60-80% distention,  = 80-100% distention). The secondary outcome measure is the accuracy of lesion detection through MRE confirmed by colonoscopy which is evaluated by a -point scale.The outcome of this study is expected to provide a novel effective clinical protocol of bowel preparation for MRE in patients with CD. We hope to highlight the concept of physician-patient satisfaction based on different methods of bowel preparation for MRE.ClinicalTrials.gov,  .

Dysbiosis, characterized by the alteration of the composition of the resident commensal bacteria in a host compared to healthy individuals, is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), two subtypes of IBD. There is growing interest to correct the underlying dysbiosis through the use of    (FMT) for the treatment of IBD.The objective of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of IBD.We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register databases from inception to 19 March 2018. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN metaRegister of Controlled Trials, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index.Only randomized trials or non-randomized studies with a control arm were considered for inclusion. Adults or pediatric participants with UC or CD were eligible for inclusion. Eligible interventions were FMT defined as the administration of  material containing distal gut  from a healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of a someone with UC or CD. The comparison group included participants who did not receive FMT and were given placebo, autologous FMT, or no intervention.Two authors independently screened the titles and extracted data from the included studies. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess study bias. The primary outcomes were induction of clinical remission, clinical relapse, and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included clinical response, endoscopic remission and endoscopic response, quality of life scores, laboratory measures of inflammation, withdrawals, and microbiome outcomes. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to synthesize effect sizes across trials. The overall certainty of the evidence supporting the primary and selected secondary outcomes was rated using the GRADE criteria.Four studies with a total of 277 participants were included. These studies assessed the efficacy of FMT for treatment of UC in adults; no eligible trials were found for the treatment of CD. Most participants had mild to moderate UC. Two studies were conducted in Australia, one study was conducted in Canada, and another in the Netherlands. Three of the included studies administered FMT via the rectal route and one study administered FMT via the nasoduodenal route. Three studies were rated as low risk of bias. One study (abstract publication) was rated as unclear risk of bias. Combined results from four studies (277 participants) suggest that FMT increases rates of clinical remission by two-fold in patients with UC compared to controls. At 8 weeks, 37% (52/140) of FMT participants achieved remission compared to 18% (24/137) of control participants (RR 2.03, 95 % CI, 1.07 to 3.86; I² = 50%; low certainty evidence). One study reported data on relapse at 12 weeks among participants who achieved remission. None of the FMT participants (0/7) relapsed at 12 weeks compared to 20% of control participants (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.02 to 4.98, 17 participants, very low certainty evidence). It is unclear whether there is a difference in serious adverse event rates between the intervention and control groups. Seven per cent (10/140) of FMT participants had a serious adverse event compared to % (7/137) of control participants (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.58; 4 studies; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Serious adverse events included worsening of UC necessitating intravenous steroids or surgery; infection such as Clostridium difficile and cytomegalovirus, small bowel perforation and pneumonia. Adverse events were reported by two studies and the pooled data did not show any difference between the study groups. Seventy-eight per cent (50/64) of FMT participants had an adverse event compared to 75% (49/65) of control participants (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.31; I² = 31%; moderate certainty evidence). Common adverse events included abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, bloating, upper respiratory tract infection, headaches, dizziness, and fever. Four studies reported on clinical response at 8 weeks. Forty-nine per cent (68/140) of FMT participants had a clinical response compared to 28% (38/137) of control participants (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.95, I² = 50%, low certainty evidence). Endoscopic remission at 8 weeks was reported by three studies and the combined results favored FMT over the control group. Thirty per cent (35/117) of FMT participants achieved endoscopic remission compared to 10% (11/112) of control participants (RR 2.96, 95 % CI 1.60 to .48, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence).   may increase the proportion of participants achieving clinical remission in UC. However, the number of identified studies was small and the quality of evidence was low. There is uncertainty about the rate of serious adverse events. As a result, no solid conclusions can be drawn at this time. Additional high-quality studies are needed to further define the optimal parameters of FMT in terms of route, frequency, volume, preparation, type of donor and the type and disease severity. No studies assessed efficacy of FMT for induction of remission in CD or in pediatric participants. In addition, no studies assessed long-term maintenance of remission in UC or CD. Future studies are needed to address the therapeutic benefit of FMT in CD and the long-term FMT-mediated maintenance of remission in UC or CD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30221898>   for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: Experience, protocol, and results.</a></h1><p>   (FMT) is a highly effective therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (R-CDI). Despite its excellent efficacy, it is still not a routine procedure in most European centers. FMT has not been widely used in Spain to date. We describe our experience with FMT, including a novel approach based on oral  capsules.We analyzed a prospectively recorded case series of patients with R-CDI treated with FMT at a single center (June 2014-July 2017). Primary outcome was defined as resolution of CDI without recurrence in a two-month period. FMT was administered via colonoscopy, nasojejunal tube, or oral capsules. All stool donors were rigorously screened.FMT was performed in 13 patients with R-CDI. Median age was 75.0 years and 76.9% were females. Six FMT were performed via nasojejunal tube,  via oral capsules, and 2 by colonoscopy. There were no procedure-related adverse events, except for bacteremia in one patient. During follow-up, R- CDI was observed in one patient at one month after FMT. The primary resolution rate was 83.3% and the overall resolution rate was 91.7%. FMT by capsules achieved a 100% resolution rate, colonoscopy 100%, and nasojejunal tube 80.0%.In our cohort, FMT proved to be safe and effective, even in high risk patients. Oral administration in capsules also proved to be safe, well-tolerated, and highly effective for R-CDI. In our experience, the FMT capsule formulation seems feasible in the routine of a hospital. This administration method will allow FMT to be more widely used.©The Author 2018. Published by Sociedad Española de Quimioterapia.

Furthermore, rCDI may affect quality of life, leaving patients in an rCDI cycle and dependant on antibiotic therapy.To discuss the importance of microbiologic factors in the development of rCDI.Literature was drawn from a search of PubMed from 2000 onwards with the search term 'recurrent Clostridium difficile infection' and further references cited within these articles.Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have shown that CDI and rCDI risk factors are similar. Development of rCDI is attendant on many factors, including immune status or function, comorbidities and concomitant treatments. Studies suggest that poor bacterial diversity is correlated with clinical rCDI. Narrow-spectrum gut microflora-sparing antimicrobials (e.g. surotomycin, cadazolid, ridinilazole) are in development for CDI treatment, while  therapeutics (faecal  , nontoxigenic C. difficile, stool substitutes) are increasingly being explored. rCDI can only occur when viable C. difficile spores are present, either within the gut lumen after infection or when reacquired from the environment. C. difficile spore germination can be influenced by gut environmental factors resulting from dysbiosis, and spore outgrowth may be affected stage by some antimicrobials (e.g. fidaxomicin, ramoplanin, oritavancin).rCDI is a significant challenge for healthcare professionals, requiring a multifaceted approach; optimized infection control to minimize reinfection; C. difficile-targeted antibiotics to minimize dysbiosis; and gut microflora restoration to promote colonization resistance. These elements should be informed by our understanding of the microbiologic factors involved in both C. difficile itself and the gut microbiome.Copyright © 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

Parameters of DCE-MRI (vascular transfer constant [K] and blood volume [BV]) in the terminal ileum were compared between before and day 90 after FMT treatment. The differences of clinical indicators (C-reactive protein [CRP], Harvey-Bradshaw index [HBI]) and DCE-MRI parameters (K, BV) between pre- and post-treatment was calculated by Student's 2-tailed, paired t-test. The correlations between percent change of clinical indicators (ΔCRP, ΔHBI) with DCE-MRI parameters (ΔK, ΔBV) were analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficients. A logistic regression model was used to identify the changes of DCE-MRI parameters related to the treatment outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) were generated to assess which DCE-MRI parameter showed the best accuracy for evaluation of therapeutic response.After treatment, mean values of clinical indicators decreased significantly (CRP: 62.68 ± 31.86 vs 43.55 ± 29.63 mg/L, P = .008; HBI: 7.18 ± 2.10 vs .73 ± 2.33, P = 0.012). Both DCE-MRI parameters showed prominent differences before and after treatment: K (1.86 ± 0.87 vs 1.39 ± 0.83 min, P = .017), BV (61.02 ± 28.49 vs 41.96 ± 22.75 mL/100 g, P = .005). There were significant correlations between ΔCRP or ΔHBI and percent change of CDE-MRI parameters (ΔK to ΔCRP: 0.659; ΔK to ΔHBI: 0.496; ΔBV to ΔCRP: 0.442; ΔBV to ΔHBI: 0.476). Compared to ΔK and ΔBV individually, the combination of both parameters performed best in assessment of therapeutic response with an area under the ROCs (AUC) of 0.948.K and BV parameters derived from DCE-MRI have the potential to assess for therapeutic response after FMT treatment for CD.

The objective of our study was to determine the success rate of FMT in patients diagnosed with severe and complicated CDI with impending colectomy in the intensive care setting.This was a 2-center study of 9 patients who met the criteria for severe and complicated CDI and had an impending colectomy. All 9 patients had failed conventional antibiotic therapy and were deemed too unstable to undergo a colectomy. Hence, FMT was considered to be the next step in managing their condition.Following FMT there was marked improvement in the patients' clinical status, with the resolution of diarrhea, reduced requirement for vasopressor, and the reduction in abdominal distention and pain. The primary cure rate of our study after a single round of FMT was 78% (7/9). Of the 9 patients 8 (88.88%) avoided a colectomy during the same hospital admission. the CDI-related death rate was 12.% (1/9) and that of non-CDI was 12.% (1/9).Our success with FMT in fulminant CDI shows that this therapeutic modality is a promising alternative to a colectomy and could be a potential bowel-saving intervention.© 2019 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29255739>Extended Screening Costs Associated With Selecting Donors for    for Treatment of Metabolic Syndrome-Associated Diseases.</a></h1><p>Knowledge of the impact of the gut microbiome on conditions other than  infection has been rapidly increasing, and the potential usefulness of    (FMT) in these indications is being explored. The need to exclude donors with an increased risk of these diseases has left uncertainties regarding the cost and feasibility of donor screening. The aim of this study was to compare our experience to other donor-screening programs and report the costs associated with establishing a donor-screening program, for the treatment of metabolic syndrome-related conditions.Forty-six potential donors (PDs) had their medical histories and physical examinations undertaken by a physician. Blood, stool, and urine were screened for 31 viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan agents in addition to biochemical characteristics. The price of advertising, doctor's visits and diagnostic tests were calculated to determine the cost of finding a donor.Of the PDs screened,  of 46 passed the history, examination, blood, stool, and urine tests. The most common reasons for exclusion included a body mass index >25 or the detection of , , or . Four of five eligible donors had subsequent travel or illness that contraindicated donation, so only 1 of 46 PDs was suitable. The total cost for finding a single suitable donor was $15190 US dollars. This screening was performed in Canada, and costs in the United States would be substantially higher.New potential therapeutic uses for FMT have created a demand for stricter exclusion criteria for donors. This study illustrates that screening many individuals to find a donor and the subsequent associated costs may make central processing and shipment a more reasonable alternative.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384699>Microbiome predictors of dysbiosis and VRE decolonization in patients with recurrent  infections in a multi-center retrospective study.</a></h1><p>The gastrointestinal microbiome is intrinsically linked to the spread of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic treatment puts patients at risk for colonization by opportunistic pathogens like vancomycin resistant Enterococcus and  by destroying the colonization resistance provided by the commensal . Once colonized, the host is at a much higher risk for infection by that pathogen. Furthermore, we know that microbiome community differences are associated with disease states, but we do not have a good understanding of how we can use these changes to classify different patient populations. To that end, we have performed a multicenter retrospective analysis on patients who received    to treat recurrent  infection. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on  samples collected as part of this study and used these data to develop a microbiome disruption index. Our microbiome disruption index is a simple index that is predictive across cohorts, indications, and batch effects. We are able to classify pre-  vs post-  samples in patients with recurrent  infection, and we are able to predict, using previously-published data from a cohort of patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell , which patients would go on to develop bloodstream infections. Finally, we also identified patients in this cohort that were initially colonized with vancomycin resistant Enterococcus and that 92% (11/12) were decolonized after the , but the microbiome disruption index was unable to predict such decolonization. We, however, were able to compare the relative abundance of different taxa between the two groups, and we found that increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae predicts whether patients were colonized with vancomycin resistant Enterococcus. This work is an early step towards a better understanding of how microbiome predictors can be used to help improve patient care and patient outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31091761>Impact of Gut  Composition on Onset and Progression of Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases.</a></h1><p>In recent years, mounting scientific evidence has emerged regarding the evaluation of the putative correlation between the gut  composition and the presence of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and arterial hypertension.

An inadequate immune response against bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract is the basic mechanism mediating the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The risk of IBD is partially heritable and approximately 12 % of patients have a family history of IBD. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were able to identify 240 genetic regions associated with IBD. Many of the implicated genes have a function in the immune system, are associated with primary immunodeficiencies or the defense against mycobacteria. Together these 240 genetic regions form an excellent framework for further investigations into the pathogenesis and therapy of IBD. However, GWAS so far were able to unravel only a fraction of the genetic IBD risk. New strategies like genome wide sequencing are currently used to identify additional (rare) genetic variants. In rare cases, IBD is also inherited as a monogenetic disease. Moreover, there likely is significant interaction between genes and environmental factors which can only be unraveled if both, genes and the environment are simultaneously considered. Interestingly, the information provided by genetic risk factors for IBD is unable to predict the clinical course of IBD. New GWAS therefore focus on IBD prognosis and first insights have already been made. The gastrointestinal tract harbors a huge number of microorganisms (). It remains an enormous challenge for the immune system to contain this bacterial load while enabling the host to benefit from the many essential contributions of the . In IBD, the  is altered to a dysfunctional (dysbiotic) state showing reduced diversity and a higher amount of potential pathogenic Proteobacteriae, such as Escherichia coli. In IBD, the  is also more dynamic in its composition over time compared to health. Further, IBD dysbiosis is more pronounced in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. In animal experiments, dysbiosis could be transferred by    from one mouse to another, triggering inflammation in the recipient. In contrast, a healthy  can downregulate the immune response of the host, for instance by bacterial short chain fatty acids (SCFA) synthesis. In addition, some bacteria with close physical contact to the intestinal wall also have specific immunosuppressive properties. So far, the highly complex network of , genetics, immune system and environment is only partially understood. The  is a potential therapeutic target which up to now can only be non-specifically influenced by antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics or   .

Deficiencies in any one of the these pathways can lead to complications, such as calcium oxalate urinary stones. While considerable research has been conducted on individual oxalate-degrading bacterial isolates, interactions between oxalate and the gut  as a whole are unknown. We examined the reduction in oxalate excretion in a rat model following oral administration of  microbes from a mammalian herbivore adapted to a high oxalate diet or to   consisting of two different formulations of mixed oxalate-degrading isolates. While all  elicited a significant reduction in oxalate excretion initially, the greatest effect was seen with  microbial , which persisted even in the absence of dietary oxalate. The reduction in oxalate excretion in animals given   corresponded with the establishment of diverse bacteria, including known oxalate-degrading bacteria and a cohesive network of bacteria centered on oxalate-degrading specialists from the  family. Results suggested that the administration of a complete community of bacteria facilitates a cohesive balance in terms of microbial interactions. Our work offers important insights into the development of targeted bacteriotherapies intended to reduce urinary oxalate excretion in patients at risk for recurrent calcium oxalate stones as well as bacteriotherapies targeting other toxins for elimination.  Oxalate is a central component in 80% of kidney stones. While mammals do not possess the enzymes to degrade oxalate, many gastrointestinal bacteria are efficient oxalate degraders. We examined the role of cohesive microbial networks for oxalate metabolism, using Sprague-Dawley rats as a model host. While the  of oxalate-degrading bacteria alone to the Sprague-Dawley hosts did increase oxalate metabolism,   from a wild mammalian herbivore, , had a significantly greater effect. Furthermore, the boost for oxalate metabolism persisted only in animals that received  . Animals receiving   had a more diverse and cohesive network of bacteria associated with the , a family known to consist of specialist oxalate-degrading bacteria, than did animals that received oxalate-degrading bacteria alone. Our results indicate that   are more effective at transferring specific functions than are microbial specialists alone, which has broad implications for the development of bacteriotherapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29875400>Microbial dysbiosis associated with impaired intestinal Na/H exchange accelerates and exacerbates colitis in ex-germ free mice.</a></h1><p>Intestinal epithelial Na/H exchange facilitated by the apical NHE3 (Slc9a3) is a highly regulated process inhibited by intestinal pathogens and in inflammatory bowel diseases. NHE3 mice develop spontaneous, bacterially mediated colitis, and IBD-like dysbiosis. Disruption of epithelial Na/H exchange in IBD may thus represent a host response contributing to the altered gut microbial ecology, and may play a pivotal role in modulating the severity of inflammation in a microbiome-dependent manner. To test whether microbiome fostered in an NHE3-deficient environment is able to drive mucosal immune responses affecting the onset or severity of colitis, we performed a series of cohousing experiments and  microbiome  into germ-free Rag-deficient or IL-10 mice. We determined that in the settings where the microbiome of NHE3-deficient mice was stably engrafted in the recipient host, it was able accelerate the onset and amplify severity of experimental colitis. NHE3-deficiency was characterized by the reduction in pH-sensitive butyrate-producing Firmicutes families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae (Clostridia clusters IV and XIVa), with an expansion of inflammation-associated Bacteroidaceae. We conclude that the microbiome fostered by impaired epithelial Na/H exchange enhances the onset and severity of colitis through disruption of the gut microbial ecology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29101931>Safety and Efficacy of    for Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection in Patients With Cancer Treated With Cytotoxic Chemotherapy: A Single-Institution Retrospective Case Series.</a></h1><p>To study the safety and efficacy of    (FMT) for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in patients with cancer treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy in a single-institution retrospective case series.Twenty-three consecutive patients with underlying hematologic (n=13) or solid (n=10) malignancies who underwent FMT for recurrent CDI from August 1, 2012, through June 30, 2016, were studied.All the patients had received cytotoxic chemotherapy a median of 12 months (range, 1-340 months) before FMT. Patients had experienced a median of 4 (range, 2-9) CDI episodes and had been treated with a median of 106 days (range, 42-495 days) of vancomycin, metronidazole, or fidaxomicin before FMT. Twelve patients (52%) had severe/severe-complicated CDI at some stage. Eight patients (35%) had active cancer and  (22%) had received chemotherapy within 12 weeks of FMT. Diarrhea resolved without recurrence within 60 days of FMT in all but 3 patients (13%) (all had negative C difficile results). Of the 22 patients who were alive 60 days or more after FMT, 11 (48%) underwent further chemotherapy and 10 (43%) received more antibiotics. Two patients (9%) developed recurrent CDI 14 and 22 months after FMT. One death occurred  days after FMT as a result of cardiac arrest unrelated to FMT. There were no other severe adverse events and no infectious complications directly attributable to FMT.This series demonstrates that FMT is a highly effective and safe therapeutic option for multiply recurrent CDI in patients with cancer treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.Copyright © 2017 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Recently, gut dysbiosis has been found to induce hypertension in rats, such that blood pressure can be normalized through  microbial . Therefore, we hypothesized that the hypertension seen in PCOS has early origins in gut dysbiosis caused by in utero exposure to excess androgen. We investigated this hypothesis with a model of prenatal androgen (PNA) exposure and maternal hyperandrogenemia by single-injection of testosterone cypionate or sesame oil vehicle (VEH) to pregnant dams in late gestation. We then completed a gut  and cardiometabolic profile of the adult female offspring.The metabolic assessment revealed that adult PNA rats had increased body weight and increased mRNA expression of adipokines: adipocyte binding protein 2, adiponectin, and leptin in inguinal white adipose tissue. Radiotelemetry analysis revealed hypertension with decreased heart rate in PNA animals. The   profile of PNA animals contained higher relative abundance of bacteria associated with steroid hormone synthesis, Nocardiaceae and Clostridiaceae, and lower abundance of Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Clostridium. The PNA animals also had an increased relative abundance of bacteria associated with biosynthesis and elongation of unsaturated short chain fatty acids (SCFAs).We found that prenatal exposure to excess androgen negatively impacted cardiovascular function by increasing systolic and diastolic blood pressure and decreasing heart rate. Prenatal androgen was also associated with gut microbial dysbiosis and altered abundance of bacteria involved in metabolite production of short chain fatty acids. These results suggest that early-life exposure to hyperandrogenemia in daughters of women with PCOS may lead to long-term alterations in gut  and cardiometabolic function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29382125> of High Hydrogen-Producing  Leads to Generation of Large Amounts of Colonic Hydrogen in Recipient Rats Fed High Amylose Maize Starch.</a></h1><p>The hydrogen molecule (H₂), which has low redox potential, is produced by colonic fermentation. We examined whether increased hydrogen (H₂) concentration in the portal vein in rats fed high amylose maize starch (HAS) helped alleviate oxidative stress, and whether the  of rat colonic  with high H₂ production can shift low H₂-generating rats (LG) to high H₂-generating rats (HG). Rats were fed a 20% HAS diet for 10 days and 13 days in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. After 10 days (experiment 1), rats underwent a hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) operation. Rats were then categorized into quintiles of portal H₂ concentration. Plasma alanine aminotransferase activity and hepatic oxidized glutathione concentration were significantly lower as portal H₂ concentration increased. In experiment 2,  derived from HG (the  group) or saline (the control group) were orally inoculated into LG on days 3 and 4. On day 13, portal H₂ concentration in the  group was significantly higher compared with the control group, and positively correlated with genera , , and , and negatively correlated with genera , , and . In conclusion, the  of  derived from HG leads to stable, high H₂ production in LG, with the resultant high production of H₂ contributing to the alleviation of oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398337>Tumor Microbiome Diversity and Composition Influence Pancreatic Cancer Outcomes.</a></h1><p>Most patients diagnosed with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) survive less than  years, but a minor subset survives longer. Here, we dissect the role of the tumor  and the immune system in influencing long-term survival. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the tumor microbiome composition in PDAC patients with short-term survival (STS) and long-term survival (LTS). We found higher alpha-diversity in the tumor microbiome of LTS patients and identified an intra-tumoral microbiome signature (Pseudoxanthomonas-Streptomyces-Saccharopolyspora-Bacillus clausii) highly predictive of long-term survivorship in both discovery and validation cohorts. Through human-into-mice    (FMT) experiments from STS, LTS, or control donors, we were able to differentially modulate the tumor microbiome and affect tumor growth as well as tumor immune infiltration. Our study demonstrates that PDAC microbiome composition, which cross-talks to the gut microbiome, influences the host immune response and natural history of the disease.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946615>Multidonor FMT capsules improve symptoms and decrease  calprotectin in ulcerative colitis patients while treated - an open-label pilot study.</a></h1><p> Growing evidence indicates that gut dysbiosis is a factor in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC).

Seven patients with active UC, aged 27-50 years, were treated with 25 multidonor FMT capsules daily for 50 days as a supplement to their standard treatment in an open-label pilot study. The primary objective was to follow symptoms through the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI). Secondary objectives were to follow changes in  calprotectin and microbial diversity through  samples and quality of life through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Participants were followed through regular visits for six months.  From a median of 6 at baseline, the SCCAI of all participants decreased, with median decreases of  ( = .001) and 6 ( = .001) after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Three of the seven patients had flare-up/relapse of symptoms after the active treatment period. The median F-calprotectin of ≥1800 mg/kg at baseline decreased significantly during the treatment period, but increased again in the follow-up period. The median IBDQ improved at all visits compared to baseline. The   α-diversity did not increase in the study period compared to baseline.

These gastrointestinal conditions are among the most challenging to manage, mainly given poor characterization of their etiopathophysiology and outcomes. Not surprisingly, therefore, targeted or curative therapies for enteric neuropathies are lacking and management is largely symptomatic.

Here, we investigated the effect of exogenous   on gut function from the perspective of analysis of the mucosal proteomes in a piglet model. A total of 289 differentially expressed proteins were annotated with 4,068 gene ontology (GO) function entries in the intestinal mucosa, and the levels of autophagy-related proteins in the forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling pathway were increased whereas the levels of proteins related to inflammation response were decreased in the recipient. Then, to assess the alleviation of epithelial injury in the Escherichia coli K88-infected piglets following FMT, intestinal microbiome-metabolome responses were determined. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the abundances of beneficial bacteria, such as  and , were increased whereas those of  and  bacteria were decreased in the infected piglets following FMT. Metabolomic analysis revealed that levels of 58 metabolites, such as lactic acid and succinic acid, were enhanced in the intestinal lumen and that seven metabolic pathways, such as branched-chain amino acid metabolism pathways, were upregulated in the infected piglets following FMT. In concordance with the metabolome data, results of metagenomics prediction analysis also demonstrated that FMT modulated the metabolic functions of gut  associated with linoleic acid metabolism. In addition, intestinal morphology was improved, a result that coincided with the decrease of intestinal permeability and the enhancement of mucins and mucosal expression of tight junction proteins in the recipient. Taken together, the results showed that FMT triggered intestinal mucosal protective autophagy and alleviated gut barrier injury through alteration of the gut microbial structure.  The gut  plays a crucial role in human and animal health, and its disorder causes multiple diseases. Over the past decade, FMT has gained increasing attention due to the success in treating Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although FMT appears to be effective, how FMT functions in the recipient remains unknown. Whether FMT exerts this beneficial effect through a series of changes in the host organism caused by alteration of gut microbial structure is also not known. In the present study, newborn piglets and E. coli K88-infected piglets were selected as models to explore the interplay between host and gut  following FMT. Our results showed that FMT triggered intestinal mucosal autophagy and alleviated gut barrier injury caused by E. coli K88.

Here, we developed a novel IBS rat model combining trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) (designated as TC-IBS) and compared it with the TNBS-induced and CUMS-induced models. TC-IBS showed a pronounced depression phenotype with increased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR)1 and CRHR2 expression at the frontal cortex and increased serum ACTH concentration. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH), as evidenced by colorectal distention (CRD) test, was highest in TC-IBS, accompanied by increased serum -hydroxytryptamine (-HT) level and colonic -HT receptor 3A (-HTR)/-HT receptor 2B expression, impaired tight junction protein expression including occludin, zonula occludens-1, and phosphorylated myosin light chain. Palonosetron, a second generation of -HTR antagonist, alleviated VH significantly in TC-IBS. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that TNBS plus CUMS induced a significant disturbance of the gut . Cytokine profile analysis of TC-IBS model indicated an innate immune activation both in serum and colonic mucosa. Further, fecal  transplantation improved VH and some pathophysiological changes in TC-IBS.

It is used as a food additive to prevent caries. We previously showed that 1.-4.0 g/kg body weight/day xylitol as part of a high-fat diet (HFD) improved lipid metabolism in rats. However, the effects of lower daily doses of dietary xylitol on gut  and lipid metabolism are unclear. We examined the effect of 40 and 200 mg/kg body weight/day xylitol intake on gut  and lipid metabolism in mice. Bacterial compositions were characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and targeted real-time PCR. Luminal metabolites were determined by capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Plasma lipid parameters and glucose tolerance were examined. Dietary supplementation with low- or medium-dose xylitol (40 or 194 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively) significantly altered the   composition in mice.

Providing 16S ribosomal RNA based microbiome characterization in a clinically actionable time frame is currently problematic. Thus, determination of microbial metabolites as surrogates for microbiome composition could offer practical biomarkers.Longitudinal  specimens (n = 451) were collected from 44 patients before HSCT through 100 days after , as well as 1-time samples from healthy volunteers (n = 18) as controls.  composition was determined using 16S ribosomal RNA V4 sequencing.  indole and butyrate levels were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.Among HSCT recipients, both  indole and butyrate levels correlated with the Shannon diversity index at baseline ( = .02 and  = .002, respectively) and directly after  ( = .006 and  < .001, respectively). Samples with high butyrate levels were enriched for Clostridiales, whereas samples containing high indole were also enriched for Bacteroidales.

Here, we show that cisplatin induces significant changes in the repertoire of intestinal commensal bacteria that exacerbate mucosal damage. Restoration of the  through -pellet gavage drives healing of cisplatin-induced intestinal damage. Bacterial translocation to the blood stream is correspondingly abrogated, resulting in a significant reduction in systemic inflammation, as evidenced by decreased serum IL-6 and reduced mobilization of granulocytes. Mechanistically, reversal of dysbiosis in response to  gavage results in the production of protective mucins and mobilization of CD11b myeloid cells to the intestinal mucosa, which promotes angiogenesis. Administration of Ruminococcus gnavus, a bacterial strain selectively depleted by cisplatin treatment, could only partially restore the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and reduce systemic inflammation, without measurable increases in the accumulation of mucin proteins. Together, our results indicate that reconstitution of the full repertoire of intestinal bacteria altered by cisplatin treatment accelerates healing of the intestinal epithelium and ameliorates systemic inflammation. Therefore,    could paradoxically prevent life-threatening bacteremia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy.©2018 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775438>The gut microbiome from patients with schizophrenia modulates the glutamate-glutamine-GABA cycle and schizophrenia-relevant behaviors in mice.</a></h1><p>Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a devastating mental disorder with poorly defined underlying molecular mechanisms.

Only little is known, however, regarding factors facilitating gastrointestinal Psae-acquisition by the vertebrate host and subsequently induced inflammatory sequelae. In the present study, we addressed whether subacute ileitis predisposed mice harboring a human gut  for intestinal MDR Psae carriage and whether inflammatory responses might be induced following peroral challenge with the opportunistic pathogen. To accomplish this, secondary abiotic mice were associated with a human gut  by   . Ten days later (i.e., on day 0), subacute ileitis was induced in human  associated (hma) mice by peroral low-dose  infection. On day  post-infection, mice were perorally challenged with 10 colony forming units of a clinical MDR Psae isolate by gavage and the  bacterial loads surveyed thereafter. Four days post-peroral challenge, only approximately one third of mice with a human gut  and subacute ileitis harbored the opportunistic pathogen in the intestinal tract. Notably, the gut  composition was virtually unaffected by the Psae-carriage status during subacute ileitis of hma mice. The Psae challenge resulted, however, in more pronounced intestinal epithelial apoptotic cell and T lymphocyte responses upon ileitis induction that were not restricted to the ileum, but also affected the large intestines. Higher Psae-induced abundances of T cells could additionally be observed in extra-intestinal compartments including liver, kidney, lung, and heart of hma mice with subacute ileitis. Furthermore, higher apoptotic cell numbers, but lower anti-inflammatory IL-10 concentrations were assessed in the liver of Psae as compared to mock treated mice with ileitis. Remarkably, Psae-challenge was accompanied by even more pronounced systemic secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-6 at day 9 post ileitis induction. In conclusion, whereas in one third of hma mice with subacute ileitis Psae could be isolated from the intestines upon peroral challenge, the opportunistic pathogen was responsible for inflammatory sequelae in intestinal, extra-intestinal, and even systemic compartments and thus worsened subacute ileitis outcome irrespective of the Psae-carrier status.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31219825> and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: promising prospects for clinical interventions?</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the most important cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries but no pharmacological therapy is currently available.

However, little progress has been made in determining the exact function of NHP on tumorigenesis. In the current study, we found that NHP inhibited colorectal tumorigenesis in the APC  transgenic mouse model, as well as induced apoptosis and blocked angiogenesis in vivo. Our in-cell study suggested that this tumorigenic preventative effect of NHP is not due to the direct impact on tumor cells. Intriguingly, by utilizing 16 s rRNA gene-based  sequencing, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased, while Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were increased in the presence of NHP. Additionally, the fecal  transplantation experiment further revealed that feeding with fecal of NHP-treated mice induced considerable inhibition of tumorigenesis, which indicates that the alteration of gut  is responsible for NHP-mediated prevention of colorectal tumorigenesis. Thus, our study not only suggests the efficacy of NHP as a potent natural product for preventing colorectal cancer but also proposes a compelling model to connect the gut  to the preventative effect of NHP on tumorigenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of post-FMT gastrointestinal symptoms.A total of 150 subjects underwent FMT for recurrent CDI, of which 68.7% (103) were female, mean age was 61. years±18.1 and 31 patients (20.7%) had preexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Thirty-six had FMT via colonoscopy with a patient-selected donor, 67 via colonoscopy with stool bank donors, and 47 via FMT capsules from stool bank donors. Among those cured, 41 (31.2%) had gastrointestinal symptoms post-FMT. The factors associated with symptoms included younger age (57.2 vs. 64.1 y, P=0.03), a baseline history of irritable bowel syndrome (36.6% vs. 13.3%, P=0.002) and preexisting inflammatory bowel disease (31.7% vs. 10%, P=0.002). Small bowel exposure to donor stool was not related to symptoms (63.4% vs. 62.2%, P=0.89).Altered bowel habits are a consequence of CDI and are common after FMT. This study suggests that donor type and FMT delivery modality are not related to the presence of irregular gastrointestinal symptoms after FMT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29691757> : concept, methodology and strategy for its modernization.</a></h1><p>   (FMT) has become a research focus of biomedicine and clinical medicine in recent years.

In both forms bone loss is due to an imbalance in the bone remodeling process, with resorption/formation skewed more toward bone loss. Recent studies and emerging evidence consistently demonstrate the potential of the intestinal  to modulate bone health. This review discusses the process of bone remodeling and the pathology of osteoporosis and introduces the intestinal  and its potential to influence bone health. In particular, we highlight recent murine studies that examine how probiotic supplementation can both increase bone density in healthy individuals and protect against primary (estrogen deficiency) as well as secondary osteoporosis. Potential mechanisms are described to account for how probiotic treatments could be exerting their beneficial effect on bone health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29299467>   as a possible treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29670191>   reverses antibiotic and chemotherapy-induced gut dysbiosis in mice.</a></h1><p>   (FMT) is now widely used to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, but has been less studied as a means to restore microbiome diversity and composition following antibiotic or chemotherapy treatments. The purpose of our study was to assess the efficacy of FMT to reverse antibiotic- and chemotherapy-induced gut dysbiosis in a mouse model. C57BL/6J mice were treated with ampicillin for 1 week and/or received a single intraperitoneal injection of -Fluorouracil. Fresh stool was collected and analyzed using shotgun metagenomics and the Illumina sequencing platform. Ampicillin caused a significant and immediate decrease in bacterial species richness and diversity that persisted for one week. In mice that received FMT, disruption of the intestinal  was reversed immediately. Antibiotic and chemotherapy administration caused significant alteration in species distribution, including a decrease in the relative proportions of Clostridium scindens and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and an increase in known pathogenic species. In mice receiving FMT, we observed a significant increase in species known to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, chemotherapy led to a critical decrease in key 'health-promoting' species and to an altered functional profile, especially when chemotherapy was administered in tandem with antibiotics, and that FMT can ameliorate these effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29773467>Human microbiome restoration and safety.</a></h1><p>The human gut microbiome consists of many bacteria which are in symbiotic relationship with human beings. The gut microbial metabolism, as well as the microbial-host co-metabolism, has been found to greatly influence health and disease. Factors such as diet, antibiotic use and lifestyle have been associated with alterations in the gut microbial community and may result in several pathological conditions. For this reason, several strategies including    and probiotic administration have been applied and proven to be feasible and effective in restoring the gut  in humans. Yet, safety concerns such as potential health risks that may arise from such interventions and how these strategies are regulated need to be addressed.

FMT was performed according to the  trial protocol: administration of fresh donor  (related or unrelated donor) through a duodenal tube after pre-treatment with vancomycin and bowel lavage. We collected information on FMT-related complications, recurrent CDI, and short- and long-term adverse events by telephone interviews using a structured questionnaire at three months after FMT, and at the time of data collection of this study.In total, 39 patients were treated with FMT. The primary cure rate (no recurrence ≤8 weeks after one infusion with donor ) was 82% (32 of 39 patients). Of the seven patients with recurrent CDI after FMT, four were cured by antibiotic therapy alone (fidaxomicin in three patients, metronidazole in one patient) and three by repeat FMT. Peri-procedural complications occurred in five patients, comprising  regurgitation or vomiting. One patient died one week post-FMT due to pneumonia; a causal relation with FMT could not be excluded. The follow-up period ranged between 3 and 68 months. No long-term side effects were reported.Our data underline the efficacy of FMT as treatment for recurrent CDI. Importantly, it is possible to cure post-FMT recurrences with antibiotic therapy alone. Peri-procedural complications do occur and should be closely monitored to help identify high-risk patients. To minimize the risk of complications, all FMT candidates should be evaluated to assess the most ideal delivery method.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29450212>   for Refractory  Infection Interrupts 25-Year History of Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29312905>Atypical Late-Onset Immune Dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-Linked Syndrome with Intractable Diarrhea: A Case Report.</a></h1><p>Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome is a rare life threatening congenital autoimmune disorder caused by mutations in the forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) gene.

In CDI, FMT has been shown to be superior to antibiotic treatment. For IBD, T2D, and NASH, several placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials are under way. Moreover, techniques and standardization are developing. With the extension of FMT as a treatment modality in diseases other than CDI, a whole new treatment option may be emerging.

(FMT) prevents recurrences, but its effect on survival has been shown only in patients with O27 ribotype CDI. Here, we investigated whether early FMT could improve survival in hospitalized CDI patients, particularly those with severe infection.We performed a retrospective cohort study between May 2013 and April 2016 at the infectious diseases department of the North University Hospital of Marseille, France. Patients received either medical treatment alone or treatment with early FMT. The primary outcome was the 3-month mortality rate.A total of 111 patients were included: 66 in the FMT group and 45 in the non-FMT group. No patient underwent surgery. The O27 ribotype (odds ratio [OR], 3.64 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.05- 12.6], P = .04), severe CDI (OR, 9.62 [95% CI, 2.16-42.8], P = .003), and FMT (OR, 0.13 [95% CI, .04-.44], P = .001) were independent predictors of 3-month mortality. FMT improved survival in severe cases (OR, 0.08 [95% CI, .016-.34], P = .001) but not in nonsevere cases (OR, 1.07 [95% CI, .02-56.3], P = .97), independent of age, sex, comorbidities (Charlson score), and ribotype. The number of severe patients who needed to be treated to save 1 life at 3 months was 2.Early FMT dramatically reduces mortality and should be proposed as a first-line treatment for severe CDI. Further studies are needed to clarify complications and contraindications. Surgery should be reassessed in this context.© The Author 2017.

Recurrent CDI, i.e., a second episode of symptomatic CDI occurring within 8 weeks of successful initial CDI treatment, occurs in ∼25% of patients, with 35 to 65% of these patients experiencing multiple episodes of recurrent disease. Using microbial communities to treat recurrent CDI, either as whole   or as defined consortia of bacterial isolates, has shown great success (in the case of  ) or potential promise (in the case of defined consortia of isolates).

We here addressed whether    (FMT) could effectively combat MDR-Psae carriage. Therefore, secondary abiotic mice were challenged with MDR-Psae by gavage. One week later, mice were subjected to peroral FMT from either murine or human donors on 3 consecutive days. Irrespective of murine or human origin of  , intestinal MDR-Psae loads decreased as early as 24 h after the initial FMT. Remarkably, the murine FMT could lower intestinal MDR-Psae burdens by approximately 4 log orders of magnitude within 1 week. In another intervention study, mice harboring a human gut  were perorally challenged with MDR-Psae and subjected to murine FMT on 3 consecutive days, 1 week later. Strikingly, within  days, murine FMT resulted in lower loads and carrier rates of MDR-Psae in mice with a human gut .

However, mechanism between gut microbial dysbiosis and pathogenesis of PD remains unexplored, and no recognized therapies are available to halt or slow progression of PD. Here we identified that gut  from PD mice induced motor impairment and striatal neurotransmitter decrease on normal mice. Sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that phylum Firmicutes and order Clostridiales decreased, while phylum Proteobacteria, order Turicibacterales and Enterobacteriales increased in  samples of PD mice, along with increased  short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Remarkably,    (FMT) reduced gut microbial dysbiosis, decreased  SCFAs, alleviated physical impairment, and increased striatal DA and -HT content of PD mice. Further, FMT reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the substantia nigra, and reduced expression of TLR4/TNF-α signaling pathway components in gut and brain. Our study demonstrates that gut microbial dysbiosis is involved in PD pathogenesis, and FMT can protect PD mice by suppressing neuroinflammation and reducing TLR4/TNF-α signaling.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

These microorganisms have evolved together with humans and worked together with body's mechanism to maintain immune and metabolic function. Emerging evidence shows that gut microbe and their metabolites open up new doors for the study of human response mechanism. The complexity and interdependence of these microbe-metabolite-host interactions are rapidly being elucidated. There are various changes of microbial levels in models or in patients of various autoimmune diseases (AIDs). In addition, the relevant metabolites involved in mechanism mainly include short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids (BAs), and polysaccharide A (PSA). Meanwhile, the interaction between microbes and host genes is also a factor that must be considered. It has been demonstrated that human microbes are involved in the development of a variety of AIDs, including organ-specific AIDs and systemic AIDs. At the same time, microbes or related products can be used to remodel body's response to alleviate or cure diseases. This review summarizes the latest research of microbes and their related metabolites in AIDs. More importantly, it highlights novel and potential therapeutics, including  microbial , probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics. Nonetheless, exact mechanisms still remain elusive, and future research will focus on finding a specific strain that can act as a biomarker of an autoimmune disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Patients were randomized by a closed envelope method in a 1: 1 ratio to either oral vancomycin or FMT-FURM. CDI resolution was considered when there was a reduction on the Bristol scale of at least 2 points, a reduction of at least 50% in the number of bowel movements, absence of fever, and resolution of abdominal pain (at least two criteria). From each patient, a  sample was obtained at days 0, 3, and 7 after treatment. Specimens were cultured to isolate C. difficile, and isolates were characterized by PCR. Susceptibility testing of isolates was performed using the agar dilution method.  samples and FMT-FURM were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.We included 19 patients; 10 in the vancomycin arm and 9 in the FMT-FURM arm. However, one of the patients in the vancomycin arm and two patients in the FMT-FURM arm were eliminated. Symptoms resolved in 8/9 patients (88.9%) in the vancomycin group, while symptoms resolved in 4/7 patients (57.1%) after the first FMT-FURM dose (P = 0.26) and in /7 patients (71.4%) after the second dose (P = 0.55). During the study, no adverse effects attributable to FMT-FURM were observed in patients. Twelve isolates were recovered, most isolates carried tcdB, tcdA, cdtA, and cdtB, with an 18-bp deletion in tcdC. All isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin but susceptible to metronidazole, linezolid, fidaxomicin, and tetracycline.

There were 36 patients who were not eligible for FMT, with two or fewer recurrences and a recurrence rate of 8.8% and all-cause mortality of 6%. One in three patients screened for FMT had a nutritional deficiency diagnosed, with zinc deficiency being most common (20%). Additional diagnoses, including inflammatory bowel disease, were made during the evaluation. FMT is a highly effective treatment for rCDI, most notably in patients with multiple recurrences.

Its protective role in intestinal colitis and tumorigenesis is dependent on the host microbiome. Host innate immunity and microbial diversity also play a role in the severity of allogeneic immune-mediated gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the principal toxicity after allogeneic haematopoietic cell . Here, we examined the role of host NLRP6 in multiple murine models of allogeneic bone marrow . In contrast to its role in intestinal colitis, host NLRP6 aggravated gastrointestinal GVHD. The impact of host NLRP6 deficiency in mitigating GVHD was observed regardless of co-housing, antibiotic treatment or colonizing littermate germ-free wild-type and NLRP6-deficient hosts with faecal microbial  from specific pathogen-free wild-type and Nlrp6 animals. Chimaera studies were performed to assess the role of NLRP6 expression on host haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic cells. The allogeneic [B6Ly5.2 → Nlrp6] animals demonstrated significantly improved survival compared to the allogeneic [B6Ly5.2 → B6] animals, but did not alter the therapeutic graft-versus-tumour effects after haematopoietic cell . Our results unveil an unexpected, pathogenic role for host NLRP6 in gastrointestinal GVHD that is independent of variations in the intestinal microbiome and in contrast to its well-appreciated microbiome-dependent protective role in intestinal colitis and tumorigenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662860>   in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Modulating gut  is a potential treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

The purpose of anti-aging medicine is to slow, stop, or reverse the aging process and its associated effects, such as disability and frailty. Anti-aging medicine is emerging as a growing industry, but many supplements or protocols are available that do not have scientific evidence to support their claims. In this review, the mechanisms of action and the clinical implications of anti-aging interventions were examined and explained. Calorie restriction mimetics define compounds that imitate the outcome of calorie restriction, including an activator of AMP protein kinase (metformin), inhibitor of growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis (pegvisomant), inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (rapamycin), and activator of the sirtuin pathway (resveratrol). Hormonal replacement has also been widely used in the elderly population to improve their quality of life. Manipulating healthy gut  through prebiotic/probiotics or    has significant potential in anti-aging medicine.

However, causal relationship between dysbiosis and constipation remains poorly understood. Serotonin transporter (SERT) is a transmembrane transport protein which re-uptakes excessive -hydroxytryptamine (-HT) from effective location to terminate its physiological effects and involves in regulating gastrointestinal motility. In this study,   from patients with constipation and healthy controls were transplanted into the antibiotic depletion mice model. The mice which received   from patients with constipation presented a reducing in intestinal peristalsis and abnormal defecation parameters including the frequency of pellet expulsion,  weight and  water content. After   , the SERT expression in the colonic tissue was significantly upregulated, and the content of -HT was decreased which negatively correlated with the gastrointestinal transit time. Moverover,   from the mice which received   from patients with constipation also upregulated SERT in Caco-2 cells. Besides, this process accompanied with the decreased abundance of Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Desulfovibrio, and Methylobacterium and an increased tend of Bacteroides and Akkermansia, which also involved in the impairment of intestinal barrier after FMT. Taken together, intestinal dysbiosis may upregulate the SERT expression and contribute to the development of chronic constipation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622538>   results in bacterial strain displacement in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h1><p>   (FMT), which is thought to have the potential to correct dysbiosis of gut , has been used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for almost a decade. Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying  engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point,  samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10  samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut . Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25  samples from  individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in  induced during FMT. All  samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut  composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Common laxatives used in clinical practice against constipation such as Senna have side effects. Enteromorpha(EP)is a common marine alga, and the polysaccharide extracted from EP has been reported possessing anti-cancer and anti-inflammation effects. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of EP and Polysaccharides from Enteromorpha (PEP) on loperamide induced constipated mice model and illustrating mechanism of action. We investigated the effect of EP and PEP on  water content, defecation frequency and gastrointestinal transit (GI) time of loperamide-induced STC mice. In addition, serum Nitric Oxide (NO) content and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor1 (VIPR1) as well as serotonin receptor (-HT) expression in the distal colon were analyzed. Furthermore, we determined the role of EP and PEP on  distribution using stool genomic 16S rRNA sequencing. EP and PEP significantly enhanced intestinal motility function, and alleviated constipation associated intestinal inflammation. Moreover, EP and PEP significantly decreased serum NO concentration, down-regulated VIPR1 expression and up-regulated -HT expression in distal colon. Genomic stool DNA MiSeq Sequencing Analysis of  community structures and distribution revealed that intestinal microecological changes caused by constipation recovered after both EP and PEP treatment. Our results indicate that EP and PEP are potent natural products which could be suggested in constipation therapy strategies.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

One of the organs significantly affected by age is the gut. Age-dependent changes of the gut-associated microbiome have been linked to increased frailty and systemic inflammation. This change in microbial composition with age occurs in parallel with a decline in function of the gut immune system; however, it is not clear whether there is a causal link between the two. Here we report that the defective germinal centre reaction in Peyer's patches of aged mice can be rescued by faecal transfers from younger adults into aged mice and by immunisations with cholera toxin, without affecting germinal centre reactions in peripheral lymph nodes. This demonstrates that the poor germinal centre reaction in aged animals is not irreversible, and that it is possible to improve this response in older individuals by providing appropriate stimuli.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29976114>Aryl hydrocarbon receptor/IL-22/Stat3 signaling pathway is involved in the modulation of intestinal mucosa antimicrobial molecules by commensal  in mice.</a></h1><p>Compelling evidence demonstrates the crucial role of the commensal  in host physiology and the detrimental effects of its perturbations following antibiotic treatment. However, the effects of commensal  on intestinal mucosa antimicrobial molecules have not been elucidated systematically. Here, we investigate the impacts of antibiotic-induced depletion and subsequent restoration of the intestinal  on the murine antimicrobial molecules in intestinal mucosa. Our results demonstrate that depletion of commensal  leads to intestinal mucosa atrophy and reduction of antimicrobial molecules, including lysozyme, regenerating islet-derived protein 3 gamma (RegIIIγ), and cryptdin  mRNA, whereas subsequent reconstitution of intestinal  by    (FMT) rescues mucosa morphology and antimicrobials. Importantly, our study shows that down-regulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), interleukin-22 (IL-22), and phosphorylated Stat3 (p-Stat3) is associated with decreased antimicrobials, which might mediate the antibiotic-associated intestinal mucosa injury. Last, exogenous activation of the AhR/IL-22/Stat3 signaling pathway with the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (Ficz) rescued antimicrobial molecule levels markedly after antibiotic treatment to levels similar to those following reconstitution of intestinal  by FMT. Together, our results demonstrate that the AhR/IL-22/Stat3 signaling pathway is involved in the modulation of intestinal mucosa antimicrobial molecules by commensal  and suggest this pathway as a promising target in the treatment of antibiotic-associated gut barrier damage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616615>Oral faecal   for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea in a dog: a case report.</a></h1><p>Successful clinical outcomes of faecal   (FMT) for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection have been reported in humans and a marmoset. However, it has been unclear whether oral FMT was effective for the treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in dogs.An 8-month-old, intact male French bulldog was presented with a 4-month history of intermittent large bowel diarrhoea. Physical and clinical examinations did not identify any specific causes for diarrhoea. Real-time PCR analysis and immunochromatography detected C. difficile antigen and toxin A&B genes and proteins in a faecal sample. Based on these findings, diarrhoea in the dog was considered to be induced by C. difficile-associated colitis. The dog was treated with oral FMT, in which a faecal solution obtained from a healthy beagle was orally administered to the subject. Stool consistency and frequency and faecal blood and mucus became normal 2-3 days after oral FMT, and real-time PCR analysis and immunochromatography was negative for C. difficile antigen and toxin A&B genes and proteins. No adverse events were observed.The present case report demonstrated that oral FMT was an effective treatment for C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in a dog.

Whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomics have the potential to improve our understanding of the dynamics of gut colonization that precede BSI in HSCT recipients. Within a prospective cohort study of children (age <18 years) undergoing HSCT, 9 subjects met criteria for mucosal barrier injury BSI. We performed whole-genome sequencing of the blood culture isolate and weekly  samples preceding the BSI to compare the genetic similarity of BSI isolates to  strains. We evaluated temporal associations between antibiotic exposures and the abundances of BSI strains in the gut  and correlated the detection of antibiotic resistance genes with the phenotypic antibiotic resistance of these strains. The median patient age was 2.6 years, and 78% were male. BSIs were caused by Escherichia coli (n = ), Enterococcus faecium (n = 2), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), and Rothia mucilaginosa (n = 1). In the 6 BSI episodes with evaluable comparative genomics, the  strains were identical to the blood culture isolate (>99.99% genetic similarity). Gut domination by these strains preceded only 4 of 7 E. coli or E. faecium BSIs by a median of 17 days (range, 6 to 21 days). Increasing abundances of the resulting BSI strains in the gut  were frequently associated with specific antibiotic exposures. E. cloacae and R. mucilaginosa were not highly abundant in  samples preceding BSIs caused by these species. The detection of antibiotic resistance genes for β-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin predicted phenotypic resistance in BSI strains. Bacterial strains causing mucosal barrier injury BSI in pediatric HSCT recipients were observed in the gut  before BSI onset, and changes in the abundances of these strains within the gut preceded most BSI episodes. However, frequent sampling of the gut  and sampling of other ecological niches is likely necessary to effectively predict BSI in HSCT recipients.Copyright © 2019 American Society for  and Cellular Therapy.

Since the beginning of the CDI epidemic in early 2000s, many strategies for combatting recurrence have been explored, with moderate success so far. This review will focus on the most recent developments in recurrent CDI prevention and treatment.There are two main mechanisms of CDI recurrence: alteration in microbiome and poor antibody response. Development of new antibiotics aims to minimize damage to the microbiome.   or other microbiome replacement therapies seek to replenish the missing elements in the microbiome.    is the most effective treatment for prevention of CDI recurrenceso far, but is difficult to standardize and regulate, leading to efforts to develop microbiome-derived therapeutics. A deficiency in developing antibodies to C. difficile toxins is another mechanism of recurrence. Active immunization using toxoid vaccines or passive immunization using mAbs address this aspect.There are promising new treatments for recurrent CDI in development.    remains the most effective therapy for multiply recurrent CDI. New antibiotics, microbiome-derived therapeutics, and immunologic therapies are in development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178437>Faecal   for treatment of recurrent or refractory  infection in Hong Kong.</a></h1><p> infection (CDI) is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infection globally, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Faecal   (FMT) has emerged as a promising option for recurrent and refractory CDI. This study aimed to assess the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of FMT for CDI in Hong Kong.We conducted a single-centre, retrospective study for all consecutive cases of recurrent or refractory CDI who underwent FMT from 2013 to 2018. Clinical demographics, outcome, and safety parameters were collected.A total of 24 patients with recurrent or refractory CDI (median age 70 years, interquartile range=45.0-78.3 years; 67% male) were included. Over 80% had been recently hospitalised or were long-term care facility residents. Faecal   was delivered by feeding tube in 11 (45.8%), oesophagogastroduodenoscopy in eight (33.3%), and colonoscopy in six (25%) of the patients. Resolution of diarrhoea without relapse within 8 weeks was achieved in 21 out of 24 patients (87.%) after FMT. No deaths occurred within 30 days. The FMT was well tolerated and no serious adverse events attributable to FMT were reported.Our results confirm that FMT is a safe, efficacious, and feasible intervention for patients with refractory or recurrent CDI in Hong Kong. Given the increasing disease burden and the lack of effective alternatives in Hong Kong for difficult-to-treat cases of CDI, we recommend that a territory-wide FMT service be established to address increasing demand for this treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30643289>Healthy infants harbor intestinal bacteria that protect against food allergy.</a></h1><p>There has been a striking generational increase in life-threatening food allergies in Westernized societies. One hypothesis to explain this rising prevalence is that twenty-first century lifestyle practices, including misuse of antibiotics, dietary changes, and higher rates of Caesarean birth and formula feeding have altered intestinal bacterial communities; early-life alterations may be particularly detrimental. To better understand how commensal bacteria regulate food allergy in humans, we colonized germ-free mice with  from healthy or cow's milk allergic (CMA) infants. We found that germ-free mice colonized with bacteria from healthy, but not CMA, infants were protected against anaphylactic responses to a cow's milk allergen. Differences in bacterial composition separated the healthy and CMA populations in both the human donors and the colonized mice. Healthy and CMA colonized mice also exhibited unique transcriptome signatures in the ileal epithelium. Correlation of ileal bacteria with genes upregulated in the ileum of healthy or CMA colonized mice identified a clostridial species, Anaerostipes caccae, that protected against an allergic response to food. Our findings demonstrate that intestinal bacteria are critical for regulating allergic responses to dietary antigens and suggest that interventions that modulate bacterial communities may be therapeutically relevant for food allergy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123221>Abnormal gut  composition contributes to cognitive dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Both diabetes and Alzheimer's disease are age-related disorders, and numerous studies have demonstrated that patients with diabetes are at an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction (CD) and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting shared or interacting pathomechanisms. The present study investigated the role of abnormal gut  in diabetes-induced CD and the potential underlying mechanisms. An intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin administered for  consecutive days was used for establishing a diabetic animal model. Hierarchical cluster analysis of Morris water maze (MWM) performance indices (escape latency and target quadrant crossing) was adopted to classify the diabetic model mice into CD and Non-CD phenotypes. Both β-diversity and relative abundance of several gut bacteria significantly differed between the CD and Non-CD groups. Further,  bacteria  from Non-CD mice, but not from CD mice, into the gut of pseudo-germ-free mice significantly improved host MWM performance, an effect associated with alterations in β-diversity and relative abundance of host gut bacteria. Collectively, these findings suggest that abnormal gut  composition contributes to the onset of diabetes-induced CD and that improving gut  composition is a potential therapeutic strategy for diabetes and related comorbidities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30643841>Severe Ileocolonic Crohn's Disease Flare Associated with    Requiring Diverting Ileostomy.</a></h1><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of developing  infection (CDI).

It is however unknown whether the gut microbiome and the gut barrier function is already altered early in sepsis development and whether it is possible to modulate the microbiome in early sepsis. Therefore, a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to examine the alterations of the microbiome and the gut barrier in early sepsis and the influence of a concomitant probiotic intervention on dysbiosis at this early stage of the disease was conducted. Patients with early sepsis, defined as fulfilling the sepsis definition from the 2012 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines but without signs of organ failure, received multispecies probiotic (Winclove 607 based on Omnibiotic® 10 AAD) for 28 days. Gut microbiome composition, function, gut barrier and bacterial translocation were studied. Patients with early sepsis had a significantly lower structural and functional alpha diversity, clustered differently and showed structural alterations on all taxonomic levels. Gut permeability was unaltered but endotoxin, endotoxin binding proteins and peptidoglycans were elevated in early sepsis patients compared to controls. Probiotic intervention successfully increased probiotic strains in stool and led to an improvement of functional diversity. Microbiome composition and function are altered in early sepsis. Probiotic intervention successfully modulates the microbiome and is therefore a promising tool for early intervention in sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29422802>Efficacy and safety of the adalimumab biosimilar Exemptia as induction therapy in moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.</a></h1><p>Data on the efficacy and safety of the adalimumab biosimilar Exemptia are limited.Patients with moderate-to-severe active steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) treated at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, India were offered cyclosporine A, biologicals or biosimilars, or surgery.

However, there is also evidence that FMT can be effective in treating ulcerative colitis. This study examined the approval and willingness of affected patients who underwent FMT. A standardized questionnaire containing 27 polar and open questions was dispatched to a cohort of 262 patients suffering from UC. It included questions regarding the FMT process, donors, and possible concerns. Additionally, aspects of social background and disease activity were addressed. The response rate was 31.3 % (n = 82). Forty-eight (58. %) patients were already aware of FMT. Forty-six (56.1 %) were willing to undergo FMT if given a respective indication. The effectiveness of the procedure (40.2 %), followed by failure of all other therapies (17.1 %), formed the principal motivation. The transmission of possible infectious agents (26.8 %), and the potential contamination of the stool graft leading to a deterioration of clinical symptoms, raised the most concerns. (20.7 %).The preferred delivery system of FMT was capsules (67.1 %), followed by colonoscopic application (47.6 %). The patients were in favour of a donor proposed by the physician (52,4 %). Willingness to undergo FMT did not differ significantly between genders (56.4 % women vs. 57.1 % men). Smokers (88.9 %), patients who did not watch television at all (77.8 %) and those with private health insurance, showed an increased willingness to undergo FMT. For the majority of the UC patients surveyed, FMT represents a feasible treatment option. Approximately half of the respondents would consider FMT as an alternative treatment option, even inspite of a satisfactory disease response to current standard therapies. Unsurprisingly, there are concerns regarding the transmission of possible infectious agents and the hygienic implementation of FMT itself.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30561131>   for the Critically Ill Patient.</a></h1><p>The gut microbiome has been implicated in a diversity of diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatic steatosis, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and anxiety. Current research also suggests the presence of a bidirectional relationship between the composition of the gut microbiome and critical illness. In the critical care setting, multiple factors (eg, use of antibiotics, aberrant nutrition, bloodstream infections, bowel ischemia, and abnormal bowel motility) strongly contribute to intestinal dysbiosis. Conversely, early studies have associated intestinal dysbiosis with worse clinical outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU), such as infection, organ failure, and mortality. The possibility of intestinal dysbiosis influencing these clinical outcomes has prompted the question of whether microbiome manipulation strategies, such as    (FMT), may have a role in the management of critical illness. After a literature search of FMT used in the ICU for indications other than Clostridium difficile infections, we found 4 case reports that describe the use of FMT in  critically ill patients with systemic inflammatory responses and no clear source of infection. This review discusses the relationship between the gut microbiome and critical illness, early data on the use of FMT in critical care, and safety considerations of FMT in the critically ill and immunocompromised populations.© 2018 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29849592>The Value of    in the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h1><p>   (FMT) has challenged the traditional management of ulcerative colitis (UC) in recent years, while it remained controversial.

Gut  can influence lung immunity whereby gut-derived injurious factors can reach the lungs and systemic circulation via the intestinal lymphatics. The intestinal 's ability to resist colonization can be extended to systemic infections or to pathogens infecting distant sites such as the lungs. Unlike the situation with large mammals, the microtus  201 strain exhibits strong virulence in mice, but nearly no virulence to large mammals (such as guinea pigs). Hence, to assess whether the intestinal  from guinea pigs was able to affect the sensitivity of mice to challenge infection with the  201 strain, we fed mice with guinea pig diets for two months, after which they were administered 0. ml of guinea pig  suspension for 30 days by oral gavage. The stools from each mouse were collected on days 0, 15, and 30, DNA was extracted from them, and 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to assess the diversity and composition of the gut . We found that the intestinal   from the guinea pigs were able to colonize the mouse intestines. The mice were then infected with  201 by lung invasion, but no statistical difference was found in the survival rates of the mice that were colonized with the guinea pig's gut  and the control mice. This indicates that the intestinal   from the guinea pigs did not affect the sensitivity of the mice to pneumonic plague.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30449078>Efficacy of   therapy in steroid dependent ulcerative colitis: a real world intention-to-treat analysis.</a></h1><p>Four high-quality randomized controlled trials have proven the efficacy of    (FMT) in active ulcerative colitis (UC). We assessed the efficacy of FMT in a real-world setting involving steroid-dependent patients with UC.This was a single-center prospective analysis of data from steroid-dependent patients with UC treated with FMT from September 2015 to September 2017 at the Dayanand Medical College, a tertiary care center in India.  samples from random unrelated donors were administered through colonoscopy at weeks 0, 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22. The primary outcome was achievement of steroid-free clinical remission, and the secondary outcomes were clinical response and endoscopic remission at 24 weeks. Modified intention-to-treat analysis was performed, which included subjects who underwent at least 1 FMT.Of 345 patients with UC treated during the study period, 49 (14.2%) had steroid-dependent UC. Of these 49 patients, 41 underwent FMT: 33 completed 7 sessions over 22 weeks according to the protocol, and 8 discontinued treatment (non-response, ; lost to follow-up, 2; and fear of adverse effects, 1). At week 24, steroid-free clinical remission was achieved in 19 out of 41 (46.3%) patients, whereas clinical response and endoscopic remission were achieved in 31 out of 41 (75.6%) and 26 out of 41 (63.4%) patients, respectively. All patients with clinical response were able to withdraw steroids. There were no serious adverse events necessitating discontinuation.A multisession FMT via the colonoscopic route is a promising therapeutic option for patients with steroid-dependent UC, as it can induce clinical remission and aid in steroid withdrawal.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29890556>[Management of Clostridium difficile infections at German intensive care units - results from a survey among intensivists].</a></h1><p>Clostridium difficile associated colitis is a frequent cause of nosocomial diarrhea at the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with poor prognosis in critically ill patients. Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of treatment options or adherence to guideline recommendations of Clostridium difficile infections at the ICU.Therefore, on behalf of the Gastroenterology Intensive Care Medicine working group of the DGVS, we have conducted an online-based survey among leading intensivists in Germany.Out of the 351 invited, 85 (24.2 %), primarily leading executive physicians at primary to tertiary care hospitals, completed the survey. They reported standardized diagnostic algorithms of 79.3 %, in line with current guideline recommendations (i. e., toxin testing in stool, possibly GDH screening, and endoscopy). First-line therapy of Clostridium difficile infections at the ICU was reported to be oral vancomycin in 48.3 % and oral metronidazole in 34. %. The success of first-line therapy was estimated at 67 % for clinical cure, 15 % persisting colitis,  % sepsis or megacolon, 10 % recurrence, and 3 % death. Hospitals of primary/secondary care more often used metronidazole compared to university hospitals. Standard treatments for recurrent infection were vancomycin orally (40 % alone, 29.1 % combined with metronidazole) or, more rarely, fidaxomicin (25. %). Fidaxomicin has been used at least once at the ICU in 79 % of the respondents. Eleven percent have used    (FMT) in selected cases at the ICU.Our survey indicated a high awareness of German intensivists for Clostridium difficile infections, but also marked differences in local therapeutic algorithms, especially in first-line treatment.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218939>  transfer for bowel disorders: efficacy or hype?</a></h1><p>Dysbiosis has been related to the pathophysiology of disorders of - gut-brain interaction (DGBI) including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional constipation (FC). Accordingly, modulation of gut  has been proposed as a potential treatment for these disorders. Gut  modulation can be effected by probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, postbiotics, antibiotics and   (FMT) or bacteriotherapy. The latter is currently used for recurrent or severe Clostridium difficile colitis and has been the focus of recent research in IBS and FC.Several case series reported promising results for FMT in patients with IBS and FC, which prompted the conduction of randomized controlled trials (RCT) in these DGBI.Both case series and RCTs are herein discussed. To the best of our knowledge, as of yet,  RCTs have been published on IBS and one in FC with slow colonic transit. In IBS, the majority of studies have used the IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) as an outcome measure; however, the selection criteria were different among the trials as well as the route and form of administration of the FMT. Therefore, the results are inconsistent and no conclusion can be drawn. Some studies suggest that the presence of post-infection (PI)-IBS and the baseline  status in the donors could be predictor factors of successful FMT in IBS. In constipation with slow colonic transit, the FMT seems to be more effective, although the data is based on only one RCT. We believe that larger RCTs, controlled with true placebos and considering baseline intestinal  of the study subjects as well as donors'  are still needed before recommending FMT in IBS and/or FC. History of previous GI infection (e.g. PI-IBS) and IBS subtypes should also be taken into account.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

CDI is an increasing cause of diarrheal illness in pediatric patients, but the effects of FMT have not been well studied in children. We performed a multi-center retrospective cohort study of pediatric and young adult patients to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and factors associated with a successful FMT for the treatment of CDI.We performed a retrospective study of 372 patients, 11 months to 23 years old, who underwent FMTs at 18 pediatric centers, from February 1, 2004, to February 28, 2017; 2-month outcome data were available from 335 patients. Successful FMT was defined as no recurrence of CDI in the 2 months following FMT. We performed stepwise logistic regression to identify factors associated with successful FMT.Of 335 patients who underwent FMT and were followed for 2 months or more, 271 (81%) had a successful outcome following a single FMT and 86.6% had a successful outcome following a first or repeated FMT. Patients who received FMT with fresh donor stool (odds ratio [OR], 2.66; 95% CI, 1.39-.08), underwent FMT via colonoscopy (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.26-4.61), did not have a feeding tube (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.05-4.11), or had 1 less episode of CDI before FMT (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04-1.39) had increased odds for successful FMT. Seventeen patients (4.7%) had a severe adverse event during the 3-month follow-up period, including 10 hospitalizations.Based on the findings from a large multi-center retrospective cohort, FMT is effective and safe for the treatment of CDI in children and young adults. Further studies are required to optimize the timing and method of FMT for pediatric patients-factors associated with success differ from those of adult patients.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

A retrospectively descriptive cohort study was carried out. Clinical data of 2010 patients who underwent FMT and received follow-up for more than 3 months from May 2014 to November 2018 were collected, including 1,206 cases from Tongji University Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital and 804 cases from Nanjing Eastern Military General Hospital. Of the 2,010 patients, 797 were male and 1,213 were female, with a mean age of (49.4±16.) years old. Inclusion criteria were those with indications for FMT and voluntary treatment of FMT. Pregnant or lactating women, patients with end-stage disease, cases who were participating or participated in other clinical trials within 3 months, and patients with previous bowel history of pathogen infection, oral antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the recent2 weeks, and those at immunosuppressive state were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from the enrolled patients and their families. There were 1,356 cases of constipation, 175 cases of inflammatory bowel disease, 148 cases of chronic diarrhea, 127 cases of radiation enteritis, 119 cases of irritable bowel syndrome, and 85 cases of autism (complicating with intestinal disorders). FMT donor requirements: (1) 18 to 30 years old non-relatives, non-pregnant healthy adults with healthy lifestyle and good eating habits as volunteers to participate in  donation; (2) no administration of antibiotics within 3 months; (3) no chronic diseases such as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, etc., no autoimmune disease, not in immunosuppressive state, no history of malignant disease; (4) negative pathogen examination of infectious diseases (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV, etc.); () negative  examination (C.difficile, dysentery bacillus, Shigella, Campylobacter, parasites, etc.). The donor requirements after enrollment: (1) physical examination was reviewed once every two months, and the result still met the above requirements; (2) 16S rRNA sequencing was performed for every  donation in order to ensure that the composition and diversity of the  flora was stable and reliable. The preparation of the stool suspension referred to the Amsterdam criteria and the preparation process was less than 1 hour. The preparation of the FMT capsule was processed by pre-freezing the stool suspension after the preparation of the above suspension, and the frozen sample was transferred into a freeze dryer for freezing. The dried and lyophilized powder was encapsulated in capsules, and the capsule shell was made of acid-resistant hypromellose capsule (No.0) and pediatric-specific capsule (No.3), sealed and packaged in a-20℃ refrigerator. Three ways of accepting FMT treatment pathways included 6-day  after the placement of the nasointestinal tube, 6-day oral FMT capsule  and one-time  through colonoscopy. Intestinal preparation (nasointestinal tube feeding of polyethylene glycol until watery stool) was carried out before . Other treatments were stopped during treatment and follow-up, and any medication was not recommended when necessary.  Of the 2010 patients, 1,497 cases received nasointestinal tube  (nasointestinal tube group), 452 cases oral capsule  (oral capsule group) and 61 cases colonoscopy (colonoscopy group).

Fifteen rats were divided into control group, LPS group and LPS+FMT group by random number table method. LPS group and LPS+FMT group were intraperitoneally injected with LPS to generate rat ALI model. After 24 h of modeling,  (10 ml/kg) were given to the LPS+FMT group twice a day, and the control group and LPS group were given the same amount of normal saline. The intervention lasted for 2 days. After 24 h of the last   , arterial blood gas analysis was performed in each group. Then rats were sacrificed and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) method was used to detect intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) content in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The lung wet-dry weight ratio (W/D) was evaluated; HE staining and lung tissue pathology scoring, immunohistochemical detection of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) predominate nuclear expression and expression of ICAM-1 of alveolar epithelial cells were conducted; Western blot was used to detect the expression of proteins related to the intracellular phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase (AKT) signaling pathway. Samples of rat  were collected and DNA was extracted. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16SrDNA) were sequenced at high throughput, and bioinformatics analysis was conducted on the microbial community based on the operational classification unit.  The lung W/D and lung histopathological score of the LPS group were significantly higher than those of the control group, while the arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO(2)) of the LPS group was significantly lower than that of the control group [(79.2±.89 vs 95.2±2.77) mmHg, 1 mmHg=0.133 kPa](all 0.05). The results of intestinal flora sequencing revealed that the diversity index of LPS group was significantly higher than that of the control group, while the lactobacillus of LPS group rats was significantly lower than that of the control group. The content of ICAM-1 in serum, BALF and its relative expression on the cell membrane in the LPS group was significantly higher than that in the control group [(8.64±0.87) vs (7.40±0.32) ng/L; (0.941±0.035) vs (0.739±0.079) ng/L; (0.250±0.010) vs (0.076±0.010)] (all 0.05). Moreover, the relative expression levels of phosphorylated P65 (p-P65), p-PI3K and p-AKT nucleoprotein in the LPS group were significantly higher than those in the control group (4.89±0.27 vs 3.28±0.13, 0.265±0.030 vs 0.036±0.013 and 0.444±0.040 vs 0.109±0.016) (all 0.05). The above injury effect was reduced after  fungus . The lung W/D and lung pathological score of LPS+FMT group were significantly lower than those of LPS group, and PaO(2) of LPS+FMT group was significantly higher than that of LPS group [(88.0±3.53) mmHg]. The results of intestinal flora sequencing revealed that the diversity index of LPS+FMT group was significantly lower than that of LPS group, and the lactobacillus genus of LPS+FMT group was significantly higher than that of LPS group. ICAM-1 in the blood serum ((7.44±0.46) ng/L), BALF (0.834±0.040) ng/L) and its relative expression on alveolar epithelial cell membrane (0.173±0.030), the relative expression of p-P65, p-PI3K and p-AKT protein of NF-κB in alveolar epithelial cells was down-regulated ((2.99±0.28, 0.090±0.013 and 0.206±0.018) in LPS+FMT group than those of LPS group, the differences were statistically significant (all 0.05).    can alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in rats, and its regulatory effect may be related to inhibiting the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway and reducing the expression of inflammatory factor ICAM-1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29674425>Impact of gut colonization with butyrate-producing  on respiratory viral infection following allo-HCT.</a></h1><p>Respiratory viral infections are frequent in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell  (allo-HCT) and can potentially progress to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). The intestinal  contributes to resistance against viral and bacterial pathogens in the lung. However, whether intestinal  composition and associated changes in microbe-derived metabolites contribute to the risk of LRTI following upper respiratory tract viral infection remains unexplored in the setting of allo-HCT.  samples from 360 allo-HCT patients were collected at the time of stem cell engraftment and subjected to deep, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to determine  composition, and short-chain fatty acid levels were determined in a nested subset of  samples. The development of respiratory viral infections and LRTI was determined for 180 days following allo-HCT. Clinical and  risk factors for LRTI were subsequently evaluated using survival analysis. Respiratory viral infection occurred in 149 (41.4%) patients. Of those, 47 (31.%) developed LRTI. Patients with higher abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria were fivefold less likely to develop viral LRTI, independent of other factors (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.04-0.69).

Best practice advice 1: A stepwise approach to rule-out ongoing inflammatory activity should be followed in IBD patients with persistent GI symptoms (measurement of  calprotectin, endoscopy with biopsy, cross-sectional imaging). Best practice advice 2: In those patients with indeterminate  calprotectin levels and mild symptoms, clinicians may consider serial calprotectin monitoring to facilitate anticipatory management. Best practice advice 3: Anatomic abnormalities or structural complications should be considered in patients with obstructive symptoms including abdominal distention, pain, nausea and vomiting, obstipation or constipation. Best practice advice 4: Alternative pathophysiologic mechanisms should be considered and evaluated (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bile acid diarrhea, carbohydrate intolerance, chronic pancreatitis) based on predominant symptom patterns. Best practice advice : A low FODMAP diet may be offered for management of functional GI symptoms in IBD with careful attention to nutritional adequacy. Best practice advice 6: Psychological therapies (cognitive behavioural therapy, hypnotherapy, mindfulness therapy) should be considered in IBD patients with functional symptoms. Best practice advice 7: Osmotic and stimulant laxative should be offered to IBD patients with chronic constipation. Best practice advice 8: Hypomotility agents or bile-acid sequestrants may be used for chronic diarrhea in quiescent IBD. Best practice advice 9: Antispasmodics, neuropathic-directed agents, and anti-depressants should be used for functional pain in IBD while use of opiates should be avoided. Best practice advice 10: Probiotics may be considered for treatment of functional symptoms in IBD. Best practice advice 11: Pelvic floor therapy should be offered to IBD patients with evidence of an underlying defecatory disorder. Best practice advice 12: Until further evidence is available,    should not be offered for treatment of functional GI symptoms in IBD. Best practice advice 13: Physical exercise should be encourage in IBD patients with functional GI symptoms. Best practice advice 14: Until further evidence is available, complementary and alternative therapies should not be routinely offered for functional symptoms in IBD.

After  days, stomach and colon bacterial compositions were determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and organic acid metabolites measured. Further, gut pathology, mucosa bacterial adherence, and goblet cell density were assessed. FMT increased the relative abundance of obligate anaerobes in the colon without affecting total bacterial load. Bacteroides colonized recipients despite low abundance in the donor , whereas highly abundant Prevotella and Ruminococcaceae did not. Further, FMT changed carbohydrate metabolism from lactate to propionate production thereby increasing colonic pH. Besides, FMT preserved goblet cell mucin stores and reduced necrotizing enterocolitis incidence. Only rectal FMT increased the stomach-to-colon pH gradient and resistance to mucosa bacterial adhesion. Conversely, oral + rectal FMT increased bacterial adhesion, internal organ colonization, and overall mortality.

This review describes the hallmark immunobiology of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action for current, experimental, and future treatments in IBD. Conventional therapies include -aminosalicylic acid, glucocorticosteroids, thiopurines, and methotrexate. Since 1997, monoclonal antibodies have gained widespread use. These consist of antibodies directed against pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL)-12, and IL-23, or anti-homing antibodies directed against α4β7 integrin. Emerging oral therapies include modulators of intracellular signal transduction such as Janus kinase inhibitors. Vitamin D may help to regulate innate and adaptive immune responses. Modulation of the intestinal , using live microorganisms (probiotics), substrates for the colonic  (prebiotics), or    (FMT), is in development. Dietary supplements are in widespread use, but providing evidence for their benefit is challenging.

She presented with nine recurrent episodes of Clostridium difficile infection including fever, foul smelling diarrhea, and respiratory distress with failed sustained responses to compliant treatment using metronidazole and pulsed vancomycin therapy. Maternal donor    was performed with complete symptom resolution and produced a sustained cure, now  years in duration.This patient presented with symptomatic Clostridium difficile at an early age causing significant morbidity and reduced quality of life.

However, there is also evidence that FMT can be effective in treating obesity. This pilot study established the approval and willingness of obese patients to undergo FMT.We conducted a survey of adults with obesity using a questionnaire containing 21 both multiple choice and open questions was dispatched to a cohort of 101 persons with obesity. It included questions aiming at the process of FMT itself, donors as well as possible concerns. Additionally aspects of social background and disease activity were dealt with.The response rate amounted to 30.1% ( = 31). In our population, mean BMI was 40. kg/m while the vast majority already tried out treatment modalities to lose weight before. 25.8% of persons with obesity were aware of FMT. 62.1% were willing to undergo FMT if the donor was healthy and anonymous while only 6.9% clearly refused this option. Sixty preferred an anonymous donor or a person proposed by their doctor while colonoscopy was the preferred application by 76.7%. The absence of risks of the procedure (47.8%) formed the principal motivation while reduction of medication was considered as least important reason (in 26.1). Insufficient testing of the faeces concerning infections raised the most concerns (in 61.6%).For the majority of the persons with obesity surveyed FMT represents a treatment option. Approximately two thirds of the questionees would consider FMT as an alternative treatment option, even in spite of a satisfactory disease response to current standard therapies. Unsurprisingly there are concerns in regard to the transmission of possible infectious agents as well as to the hygieneic implementation of FMT itself.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463736>Loss of Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase Leads to Distinct Chronic Changes in Bone Phenotype.</a></h1><p>The gut is becoming increasingly recognized as the source of various systemic diseases, and recently, it has been linked to bone metabolism via the so-called gut-bone axis. The microbiome and gut-derived mediators are thought to impact upon bone metabolism, and administration of probiotics has been shown to have beneficial effects in bone. The gut brush border enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) plays an important role in controlling calcium absorption, inhibiting lipopolysaccharides, and other inflammatory mediators responsible for endotoxemia and appears to preserve the normal gut . Interestingly, IAP-deficient mice (AKP3) also display a significant decrease in  Lactobacillus, the genus shown to be beneficial to bone.IAP mRNA levels in mouse bone were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Femurs of IAP-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were analyzed by microcomputed tomography and histopathology. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphorus were measured. Target cell response upon exposure to serum from IAP-KO and WT mice was quantified using primary bone marrow macrophages.IAP was not significantly expressed in bones of WT or KO animals. IAP (alkaline phosphatase 3) expression in bone was vanishingly low compared to the duodenum (bone versus duodenum, 56.9 ± 17.7 versus 25,430.3 ± 10,884. relative expression, P = 0.01). Bone histology of younger IAP-KO and WT animals was indistinguishable, whereas older IAP-deficient mice showed a distinctly altered phenotype on histology and computed tomography scan. Younger KO mice did not display any abnormal levels in blood chemistry. Older IAP-KO animals showed an isolated increase in serum alkaline phosphatase levels reflecting an environment of active bone formation (IAP-WT versus IAP-KO, 80 ± 27.4 U/I versus 453 ± 107. U/I, P = 0.004). There was no significant difference in serum calcium or phosphorus levels between KO and WT mice. Serum from IAP-KO mice induced a significantly higher inflammatory target cell response.Through its multiple functions, IAP seems to play a crucial role in connecting the gut to the bone. IAP deficiency leads to chronic changes in bone formation, most likely through dysbiosis and systemic dissemination of proinflammatory mediators.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Faecal   (FMT) appears to be an attractive option for decolonization. This study aimed to evaluate CRE vs VRE clearance by FMT among carriers.A multi-centre trial was undertaken on patients with CRE or VRE digestive tract colonization who received FMT between January 2015 and April 2017. Adult patients with CRE or VRE colonization, confirmed by three consecutive rectal swabs at weekly intervals, including one in the week prior to FMT, were included in the study. Patients with immunosuppression or concomitant antibiotic prescription at the time of FMT were excluded. Successful decolonization was determined by at least two consecutive negative rectal swabs [polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture] on Days 7, 14, 21 and 28, and monthly for three months following FMT.Seventeen patients were included, with a median age of 73 years [interquartile range (IQR) 64.3-79.0]. Median duration of carriage of CRE or VRE before FMT was 62. days (IQR 57.0-77.). One week after FMT, three of eight patients were free of CRE colonization and three of nine patients were free of VRE colonization. After three months, four of eight patients were free of CRE colonization and seven of eight patients were free of VRE colonization. Qualitative PCR results were concordant with culture. Six patients received antibiotics during follow-up, three in each group. No adverse events were reported.CRE and VRE clearance rates were not significantly different in this study, possibly due to the small sample size, but a trend was observed. These data should be confirmed by larger cohorts and randomized trials.Copyright © 2018 The Healthcare Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, potentially helpful microbial cells are killed along with the pathogen, altering the biodiversity and dynamic interactions within the population. Moreover, the unwarranted exposure of antibiotics to microbes increases the likelihood of developing resistance and perpetuates the emergence of multidrug resistance. Synthetic biology offers an alternative solution where specificity can be conferred to reduce the non-specific, non-targeted activity of currently available antibiotics, and instead provides targeted therapy against specific pathogens and minimising collateral damage to the host's inherent . With a greater understanding of the microbiome and the available genetic engineering tools for microbial cells, it is possible to devise antimicrobial strategies for novel antimicrobial therapy that are able to precisely and selectively remove infectious pathogens.

The proportion of participants with rCDI in 12 weeks,    procedures, 30-day all cause and CDI-associated hospital readmissions, and mortality at 30 and 90 days after randomization were presented.The majority of enrolled participants (75.6%) had ≥1 risk factor; these participants were older and a higher proportion had comorbidities compared with participants with no risk factors. The proportion of placebo participants who experienced rCDI exceeded 30% for each risk factor compared with 20.9% among those without a risk factor, and the rCDI rate increased with the number of risk factors (1 risk factor: 31.3%; ≥3 risk factors: 46.1%). Bezlotoxumab reduced rCDI,   , and CDI-associated 30-day readmissions in participants with risk factors for rCDI.The risk factors prespecified in the MODIFY statistical analysis plan are appropriate to identify patients at high risk for rCDI.

However, its mechanism of action in the treatment of IBS-D remains to be fully understood. Recent reports have shown that  species in the gut can induce  production in the colon, which then contributes to IBS-D. Due to the wide use of TXYF in the clinical treatment of IBS-D and the close relationship between gut  and IBS-D, we hypothesize that TXYF treats IBS-D by modulating gut  and regulating colonic  levels. In this study, variation analysis of 16S rRNA was conducted to evaluate changes in the distribution of gut  in IBS-D model rats after TXYF treatment. Moreover, we investigated whether TXYF could affect colonic  levels in IBS-D model rats. We then performed   experiments to confirm the effects of TXYF on gut  and  levels. We found that TXYF treatment can ameliorate IBS-D and regulate  levels in colon tissue homogenates. TXYF treatment also affected the diversity of gut  and altered the relative abundance of  and  in gut flora populations. Finally, we showed that   from TXYF-treated rats could relieve IBS-D and regulate  levels in colon tissue homogenates. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that TXYF treatment diminishes colonic  levels and alleviates the symptoms of IBS-D by favorably affecting  levels in gut flora communities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518033>Differences in Anxiety Levels of Various Murine Models in Relation to the Gut  Composition.</a></h1><p>Psychobiotics are probiotic strains that confer mental health benefits to the host through the modulation of the gut microbial population. Mounting evidence shows that the gut  play an important role in communication within the gut⁻brain axis. However, the relationship between the host genetics and the gut  and their influence on anxiety are still not fully understood. Hence, in our research, we attempted to draw a connection between host genetics,  composition, and anxiety by performing an elevated plus maze (EPM) test on four genetically different mice. Four different breeds of -week-old mice were used in this experiment: Balb/c, Orient C57BL/6N, Taconic C57BL/6N, and Taconic C57BL/6J. After 1 week of adaptation, their initial anxiety level was monitored using the EPM test via an EthoVision XT, a standardized software used for behavorial testing.

In this study, we aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy of FMT in treating children with RCDI, and explore   changes during FMT treatment. A total of 11 RCDI subjects with a median age of 3. years were enrolled in this single-center prospective pilot study. All patients were cured (11/11, 100%) by FMT either through upper gastrointestinal tract route with a nasointestinal tube (13/16, 81.2%) or lower gastrointestinal tract route with a rectal tube (3/16, 18.8%). The cure rate of single FMT was 63.6% (7/11), and 4 (4/11, 36.4%) cases were performed with 2 or 3 times of FMT. Mild adverse events were reported in 4 children (4/11, 36.4%), including transient diarrhea, mild abdominal pain, transient fever and vomit. Gut  composition analysis of 59  samples collected from 34 participants (9 RCDI children, 9 donors and 16 health controls) showed that the  diversity was lower in pediatric RCDI patients before FMT than the healthy controls and donors, and  microbial community of pre-FMT samples ( diversity) was apart from that of healthy controls and donors. No significant differences in  diversity,  diversity or phylogenetic distance were detected between donors and healthy controls. Both the richness and diversity of gut  were improved in the pediatric RCDI patients after FMT, and the bacteria community was shifted closer to the donor and healthy control group. Furthermore, FMT re-directed gut microbiome functions of pediatric RCDI toward a health state. Our results indicate that it is safe and tolerant to use FMT in treating pediatric RCDI. FMT shifted the gut microbiome composition and function in children with RCDI toward a healthy state.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28707337>Systematic review with meta-analysis: the efficacy of faecal   for the treatment of recurrent and refractory Clostridium difficile infection.</a></h1><p>Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the commonest nosocomial cause of diarrhoea.

The role of  microbial  (FMT) in restoring gut microbial function is unclear in cirrhosis. In a Food and Drug Administration-monitored phase 1 clinical safety trial, patients with decompensated cirrhosis on standard therapies (lactulose and rifaximin) were randomized to standard-of-care (SOC, no antibiotics/FMT) or  days of broad-spectrum antibiotics followed by FMT from a donor enriched in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. Microbial composition (diversity, family-level relative abundances), function ( bile acid [BA] deconjugation, 7α-dehydroxylation, short-chain fatty acids [SCFAs]), and correlations between Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and clinical variables were analyzed at baseline, postantibiotics, and 15 days post-FMT. FMT was well tolerated. Postantibiotics, there was a reduced microbial diversity and autochthonous taxa relative abundance. This was associated with an altered  SCFA and BA profile. Correlation linkage changes from beneficial at baseline to negative after antibiotics. All of these parameters became statistically similar post-FMT to baseline levels.
