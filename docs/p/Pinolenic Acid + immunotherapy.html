In the present work we evaluated the effect of oral administration of cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) and/or methyl-prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) on lipid composition and polyunsaturated fatty  biosynthesis in normal adult male rats. The results obtained showed that both agents produced a delay on the growth together with a significant loss of body weight. In liver microsomal fraction from rats treated with methyl-prednisone, a depression in delta 6 and delta 5 desaturation activities, was observed. This effect was corroborated in the fatty  pattern through the enhancement of linoleic and dihomo-gamma- acids, and a depression of arachidonic . Similar results were noticed in those rats treated with both drugs when compared to the controls. No changes were observed either in the amount of liver microsomal total lipids or in the fatty  composition of kidney and testis microsomes, as well as in erythrocyte membranes, among the different groups studied. Cyclosporine alone produced a significant depression in plasma triglycerides and showed no modifications in the other lipid parameters studied compared to the controls. Fluorescence anisotropy measured in the different membranes was not modified by the several treatments used. In view of the aforementioned data, it can be stated that methyl-prednisone would be the responsible for many of the lipid disorders that can be observed in posttransplant patients when they are subjected to the combined  with cyclosporine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21346107>Dietary fatty acids affect the immune system in male mice sensitized to ovalbumin or vaccinated with influenza.</a></h2><p>PUFA are precursor molecules for eicosanoids such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins and may influence immune function through other mechanisms involving membranes, cell signaling, and gene expression. Immune-modulating properties of diets containing different oils [sunflower oil, rich in linoleic ; linseed oil, rich in α-; salmon oil, rich in marine (n-3) PUFA; and beef tallow, rich in SFA] were investigated in an influenza-vaccination model, in which the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response was studied in C57BL/6 mice, and an ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitization model for experimental allergy in BALB/c mice. Six-week-old mice were fed the different diets for 7 wk. The first vaccination or OVA sensitization was given 2 wk after the start of the dietary intervention. In the mice vaccinated with influenza, the DTH response to the vaccine was significantly higher in mice fed the marine (n-3) PUFA diet compared to all other groups, indicating that these PUFA promote a T helper-1 response. In the OVA-sensitized mice, those fed the marine (n-3) PUFA diet had a less severe acute allergic skin response (ASR), suggesting that (n-3) PUFA lessen the T helper-2 response. Mice fed the SFA-rich diet had the most severe ASR, indicating that a diet with high levels of SFA may contribute to increased severity of allergic symptoms. Whereas significant differences in in vivo immune responses were measured, in vitro responses did not differ among the dietary groups. In conclusion, using 2 different models of immune responses demonstrates potential benefits from marine (n-3) PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15971520>Effects of dietary ratio of linoleic to  on performance, antibody production, and in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in two strains of leghorn pullet chicks.</a></h2><p>The effects of dietary ratio of linoleic  to  on performance, mitogenic lymphocyte proliferation, and antibody production were evaluated in Leghorn pullets during a rigorous vaccination program. Diets were supplemented with flaxseed and corn oil to achieve 4 dietary ratios of linoleic  to  [17:1 (control), 8:1, 4:1, or 2:1]. Each diet was fed to HyLine Brown or W-36 pullets from 1 d to 16 wk of age. Day-old pullets were randomly assigned to 8 replicate cages with 12 pullets per cage; the density was reduced to 8 pullets per cage at 11 wk of age. Dietary treatments did not affect body weight, feed consumption, or pullet mortality. At 12 wk of age, an interaction between diet and strain (P < or = 0.004) showed Hy-Line W-36 pullets fed the 2:1 ratio had greater antibody production against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine than those fed diets with higher ratios. At wk 16, pullets fed ratios of 4:1 and 2:1 had the greatest antibody production against NDV vaccine. Antibody production against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) vaccine was also increased (P < 0.04) by ratios of 4:1 (2.244 optical density; OD) or 2:1 (2.508 OD) as compared with the control diet (1.576 OD). Hy-Line Brown pullets had greater antibody production against infectious bronchitis virus vaccine compared with Hy-Line W-36 pullets at 16 wk of age. These results indicate that feeding a reduced dietary ratio of linoleic to  by adding flaxseed to the diets enhanced antibody response to NDV and IBDV vaccines without any negative effects on pullet performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20855086>Pretransplant free fatty acids (FFA) and allograft survival in renal transplantation.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids and their eicosanoid metabolites have been shown to be important mediators of the immune response in transplantation. We hypothesize that elevated pretransplant free fatty acids (FFA) levels may be associated with prolonged survival of kidney transplants.Archived pretransplant sera of 130 patients who received a kidney transplant from 1991 to 1997 were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography for a comprehensive FFA profile. FFA levels were categorized by quartiles, and the association between quartiles of the levels for each free-fatty  and graft survival was initially screened by serial univariate analyses (Kaplan-Meier). All significant variables (FFAs and transplant-specific risk factors) were entered into a multivariable (Cox regression) model.With > 10 y of follow-up, 68 kidney allografts were lost. Factors associated with decreased graft survival by univariate analysis included delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR), and cold ischemic time (CIT) > 24 h. High levels of arachidonic and γ- FFA were associated with higher graft survival rates. By multivariate analysis, only DGF, AR, CIT, and arachidonic  levels were significant. The odds ratios for graft failure for the highest, third, and second quartiles of the pretransplant level of arachidonic , compared with the lowest quartile, were 0.18, 0.32, and 0.64, respectively (P = 0.050, log-rank test). For arachidonic  the survival benefit appeared to be graded with the highest quartile associated with a greater than 80% reduction of risk of kidney graft failure.Pretransplant level of arachidonic  was independently associated with higher kidney graft survival rates. Further studies are necessary to identify the underlying mechanisms and to determine whether interventions aimed at increasing pretransplant arachidonic  levels might prove beneficial for renal transplant outcomes.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Carcass traits and physicochemical parameters, including fatty  profile, were investigated. The only carcass trait significantly affected by castration was the ham fat thickness, where both immune-spayed and surgically spayed females showed higher values against entire females (57±9.5mm, 62±2.5mm and 51±10.1mm, respectively; p<0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the quality parameters of fresh meat. These results are important regarding animal welfare, since in Europe, there is a plan to voluntarily end the surgical castration of pigs by 2018. Therefore, with an adequate vaccination protocol, immune-spaying might represent a good alternative to surgical spaying. The reliability of immune-spaying over long periods should be evaluated.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Eighty-nine patients were studied and followed for 6 months after transplantation. Forty-four took the PUFA preparation and 45 the placebo (oleic ). Other immunosuppression was standardised. Functional graft survival was significantly better in the PUFA group than in those taking the placebo during the first 3 to 4 months post-transplant. At 6 months, however, although the difference between the groups persisted, it was no longer statistically significant. Complications were equally distributed between the groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17134970>HER2 (erbB-2)-targeted effects of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty ,  (ALA; 18:3n-3), in breast cancer cells: the "fat features" of the "Mediterranean diet" as an "anti-HER2 cocktail".</a></h2><p>Data derived from epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that alphalinolenic  (ALA; 18:3n-3), the main omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) present in the Western diet, may have protective effects in breast cancer risk and metastatic progression. A recent pilot clinical trial assessing the effects of ALA-rich dietary flaxseed on tumor biological markers in postmenopausal patients with primary breast cancer demonstrated significant reductions in tumor growth and in HER2 (erbB-2) oncogene expression.The molecular mechanism by which ALA inhibits breast cancer cell growth and metastasis formation may involve a direct regulation of HER2, a well-characterized oncogene playing a key role in the etiology, progression and response to some chemo- and endocrine therapies in approximately 20% of breast carcinomas.Using HER2-specific ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, RT-PCR and HER2 promoter-reporter analyses, we characterized the effects of exogenous supplementation with ALA on the expression of HER2 oncogene, a master key player in the onset and metastasis formation of breast cancer disease. Metabolic status (MTT) assays were performed to evaluate the nature of the cytotoxic interaction between ALA and the humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). To study these issues we used BT-474 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cells, which naturally exhibit amplification of the HER2 oncogene.ALA treatment dramatically suppressed the expression of HER2-coded p185Her-2/neu oncoprotein as determined by ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting techniques. Interestingly, ALA-induced down-regulation of p185Her-2/neu correlated with a transcriptional response as no HER2 mRNA signal could be detected by RT-PCR upon treatment with optimal concentrations of ALA (up to 20 microM). Consistent with these findings, ALA exposure was found to dramatically repress the activity of a Luciferase reporter gene driven by the HER2 promoter. Moreover, the nature of the cytotoxic interaction between ALA and trastuzumab (Herceptin) revealed a significant synergism as assessed by MTT-based cell viability assays.i) These findings reveal that the omega-3 PUFA ALA suppresses overexpression of HER2 oncogene at the transcriptional level, which, in turn, interacts synergistically with anti-HER2 trastuzumab- based . ii) Our results molecularly support a recent randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial suggesting that ALA may be a potential dietary alternative or adjunct to currently used drugs in the management of HER2-positive breast carcinomas. iii) Considering our previous findings demonstrating the <<HER2 upregulatory actions>> of the omega-6 PUFA  (LA; 18:2n-6) and the <<HER2 down-regulatory actions >> of the omega-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) and of the omega-9 monounsaturated fatty  oleic  (OA; 18:1n-9), it is reasonable to suggest that a low omega-6/omega-3 PUFA ratio and elevated MUFA levels, the two prominent <<fat features>> of the <<Mediterranean diet>>, should be extremely efficient at blocking HER2 expression in breast cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10947178>Dietary linoleic  divergently affects immune responsiveness of growing layer hens.</a></h2><p>The effects of linoleic (LA)- and  (LNA)-enriched diets on humoral and in vivo cellular immune responses to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-dinitrophenyl (DNP) and Mycobacterium butyricum were studied in growing layer hens. Pullets were fed one of three diets: a control, LA enriched, or LNA enriched. Pullets were assigned to one of three immunization treatments: KLH-DNP, M. butyricum, or PBS. The LA-enriched diet enhanced the antibody response to KLH in pullets immunized with KLH-DNP. On the other hand, the antibody response to M. butyricum in M. butyricum-immunized birds was decreased by feeding an LA-enriched diet. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation in the presence of Concanavalin A was affected by the interaction between diet and immunization. Neither cutaneous hypersensitivity to KLH nor to M. butyricum was affected by the diet. The BW gain before immunization was not affected by the diet, but after immunization, the LA-enriched diet enhanced growth in birds immunized with M. butyricum. Diets had various effects on organ weights. We concluded that dietary linoleic  enrichment of the diet has an antigen-dependent divergent effect on the antibody response. The dietary LNA effect on the antibody response is less pronounced and is opposite to that of the LA effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11469650>Interactions and antigen dependence of dietary n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on antibody responsiveness in growing layer hens.</a></h2><p>Effects of four levels of dietary linoleic  (LA), an n-6 fatty , and four levels of  (LNA), an n-3 fatty , and their interactions on immune responses in growing layer hens were studied. Immune responses were induced by injection with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or Mycobacterium butyricum particles at 35 d of age. Antibody (Ab) responses were measured until 21 d after immunization. In addition, delayed-type hypersensitivity, lymphocyte proliferation, weekly feed intake, and BW gain were studied. At Day 7 after immunization, anti-M. butyricum titers in the M. butyricum-immunized hens were decreased by the increase of dietary LA (P < 0.05). In the period from 10 to 14 d after immunization, anti-KLH Ab titers in KLH-immunized animals were affected by the interaction of dietary LA with LNA (P < 0.01). High dietary levels of LA or LNA increased the anti-KLH Ab response. However, at high levels of dietary LA and LNA, anti-KLH Ab titers were not increased. In the same period, anti-M. butyricum Ab titers of M. butyricum-immunized hens were affected by the interaction of dietary LA with LNA (P < 0.05). At low levels of LA and LNA, increased LA levels decreased the Ab response, whereas increased LNA levels at low LA levels hardly affected the anti-M. butyricum response. At a high level of LA, increased dietary LNA increased the anti-M. butyricum response. In vitro proliferation of peripheral blood leukocytes after stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA) was higher in chickens with a high level of dietary LNA. Feed intake decreased when the dietary levels of LA or LNA increased. However, BW gain was not affected by dietary treatments. Feed conversion was more efficient in birds fed high levels of LA and LNA. The present study indicates that various factors affect the Ab responses. First, the interaction of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is more important than the separate effects of n-3 or n-6. Second, the actions of dietary PUFA were different between antigens of a different nature. Third was the nature of the antigen affects when dietary PUFA exert their actions and the persistence of these effects. The presence of these multiple factors affecting immune responses should be considered when comparing effects of dietary PUFA on immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28570944>Oral feeding with polyunsaturated fatty acids fosters hematopoiesis and thrombopoiesis in healthy and bone marrow-transplanted mice.</a></h2><p>Hematopoietic stem cells play the vital role of maintaining appropriate levels of cells in blood. Therefore, regulation of their fate is essential for their effective therapeutic use. Here we report the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in regulating hematopoiesis which has not been explored well so far. Mice were fed daily for 10 days with n-6/n-3 PUFAs, viz. linoleic  (LA), arachidonic  (AA),  and docosahexanoic  (DHA) in four separate test groups with phosphate-buffered saline fed mice as control set. The bone marrow cells of PUFA-fed mice showed a significantly higher hematopoiesis as assessed using side population, Lin-Sca-1ckit+, colony-forming unit (CFU), long-term culture, CFU-spleen assay and engraftment potential as compared to the control set. Thrombopoiesis was also stimulated in PUFA-fed mice. A combination of DHA and AA was found to be more effective than when either was fed individually. Higher incorporation of PUFAs as well as products of their metabolism was observed in the bone marrow cells of PUFA-fed mice. A stimulation of the Wnt, CXCR4 and Notch1 pathways was observed in PUFA-fed mice. The clinical relevance of this study was evident when bone marrow-transplanted recipient mice, which were fed with PUFAs, showed higher engraftment of donor cells, suggesting that the bone marrow microenvironment may also be stimulated by feeding with PUFAs. These data indicate that oral administration of PUFAs in mice stimulates hematopoiesis and thrombopoiesis and could serve as a valuable supplemental therapy in situations of hematopoietic failure.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

According to our previous experiments, it could bring out the IgE response to ovabumin (OVA) if TCS was given one day before OVA immunization, while OVA alone could not induce IgE to it. In this work, the kinetics of interleukin 4(IL-4) and interferon gamma(IFN-gamma) gene expression in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) of TCS-immunized mice was investigated using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR method. It indicated that TCS induced significant IL-4 gene expression and the peaks of IL4 gene expression were on day one after TCS immunization in both primary and secondary response. In contrast, the IFN-gamma gene expression was suppressed. Furthermore, the IL-4 gene expression in the secondary response was lower than that in the primary response. Thus the presence of IgE memory B cells were studied. Results showed that the amount of mature IgE mRNA arose significantly and rapidly one day after TCS restimulation, while in the MLN of the mice primed 30 days before and without boost, it was almost as the same amount of the unimmunized control. These findings suggest the existence of the IgE memory B cells in the mice after the primary TCS immunization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12365510>Different sources of dietary n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and their effects on antibody responses in chickens.</a></h2><p>1. Effects of linoleic and  provided via different oil sources on total antibody (Ab) titres, Ab isotypes after primary and secondary immunisation, and cutaneous hypersensitivity (CH) responses to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and maleyl-BSA, respectively, were studied in pullets fed on one of 4 diets. The diets were the basal control diet enriched with either sunflower oil or safflower oil as sources of linoleic , and linseed oil as a source of , tested against a control diet supplemented with animal fat. 2. Total Ab and immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype responses to BSA were affected by diet after primary, and diet x immunisation effects after secondary immunisation. Higher total Ab and IgG titres to BSA were found especially after primary immunisation in birds given the sunflower oil enriched diet, whereas birds given sunflower oil mounted significantly lower IgM titres to BSA after primary and secondary immunisation. The antibody responses to maleyl-BSA were affected by diet after primary, and immunisation x diet interactions after secondary immunisation. Sunflower oil enhanced total and IgG Ab titres to maleyl-BSA after primary immunisation, but decreased IgM titres to maleyl-BSA after primary and secondary immunisation. Cutaneous hypersensitivity responses to BSA and maleyl-BSA were not affected by the diet. 3. It is concluded that modulation of the magnitude and isotype of Ab responses of poultry to T cell-dependent antigens is affected not only by type of essential fatty acids, but also by their source. In the present study the n-6 source, sunflower oil, showed strong enhancement of primary Ab responses, directed to both Th2 and Th1 antigens. On the other hand, the different effects of safflower oil imply that constituents other than n-6 acids within dietary plant oils may affect immune responsiveness. 4. The relationship between magnitude and isotype of Ab responsiveness, type of antigen, and essential fatty acids is discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7204969>The biologic activity of the immunoregulatory lipoprotein, LDL-In is independent of its free fatty  content.</a></h2><p>The immunoregulatory normal plasma lipoprotein subclass, termed LDL-In, suppresses a number of immune responses in vitro including peripheral blood lymphocyte phytohemagglutinin-stimulated 3H-thymidine uptake, pokeweed mitogen-driven immunoglobulin synthesis, and the generation of cytolytic T cells. In vivo parallels have also been demonstrated. Plasma lipoproteins represent noncovalent complexes of lipid and apolipoprotein chains. Since free fatty acids have been demonstrated to suppress certain lymphocyte responses including mitogen-stimulated 3H-thymidine uptake, we have examined the hypothesis that the free fatty acids associated with LDL-In particles are the biologically active constituents. However, the dose-dependence and the kinetics of LDL-In-mediated suppression were distinctly different from those observed for a number of free fatty acids. In addition, when greater than 92% of the endogenous free fatty acids of LDL-In were removed by incubation in the presence of delipidated albumin, no differences were observed between this free fatty  depleted LDL-In and native LDL-In with respect to suppressive activity for lymphocyte stimulation or binding to the lymphocyte LDL-In receptor. These observations indicate that the interaction of the LDL-In particle with the lymphocyte receptor and the suppression of lymphocyte function are independent of the free fatty  content of this bioregulatory lipoprotein, thus focusing attention on the apolipoprotein chains or the phospholipids and glycolipids of this minor plasma lipoprotein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15384603>Breastfeeding protects against the anorectic response to infection in infants: possible role of DHA.</a></h2><p></p></html>
